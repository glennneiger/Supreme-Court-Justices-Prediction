mr.
gideon
kanner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
particularly,
in
view
of
the
controversy
that
erupted
in
the
briefing,
it
seems
appropriate
to
emphasize
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
case
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
amici
have
indeed
been
prolific,
your
honor.
we
have
here
a
combination
of
factors.
there
is
an
impact
of
--
a
twofold
impact
on
the
subject
property.
we
have
first
of
all,
the
regulatory
impact,
the
intrusive
regulation
which
in
fact
appellants
contend
deprives
the
subject
property
of
all
use
and
value
in
the
marketplace.
the
second
factor
which
is
not
in
our
view
received
the
proper
amount
of
attention
from
the
appellee's
side,
is
that
we
have
here
a
fairly
extensive
long
standing
and
overt
accusatory
activities
by
the
city.
and
there's
a
long
standing
official
announcements
and
commitments
to
acquisition
of
this
property
and
long
standing
studies
by
experts
indicating
that
this
property
was
to
be
a
--
an
indispensable
part
of
the
city's
open
space.
mr.
gideon
kanner
not
quite,
your
honor.
the
--
the
second
count
was
also
sustained,
but
with
leave
to
amend.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
that
was
the
declaratory
relief
count
and
the
plaintiffs
then
declined
to
amend
instead
on
that
--
on
that
part
of
the
pleading.
mr.
gideon
kanner
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
that
and
that
is
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
there
was
no
administrative
remedy
on
this
ordinance,
your
honor.
there
was
at
--
would
have
been,
had
mr.
agins
gone
ahead
and
decided
to
build.
the
point
is
that
one
owns
property
not
necessarily
to
build.
he
may
wish
to
sell
it.
he
may
wish
to
do
something
else
with
it.
the
point
is
that
the
property,
the
allegation
goes,
has
now
been
rendered
unusable
and
worthless
in
the
marketplace.
who
is
going
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
for
any
purpose.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
we
cannot
and
because
again,
your
honor,
it
has
been
a
disadvantage
precisely,
because
of
the
procedural
posture
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
that
is
we
have
before
your
honors
a
complaint
that
has
never
been
even
amended
once.
the
demurrer
was
sustained
without
to
--
leave
to
amend
even
once.
so,
we
only
have
the
bare
language
of
the
pleading
and
under
california
practice,
the
so
called
pleading
of
ultimate
facts,
which
haven't
forbid,
must
not
be
evidentiary
facts
that
is
forbidden.
so,
we
cannot
on
this
record,
point
to
any
facts
that
would
present
the
court
with
the
evidence
that
we
could
put
on,
had
we
been
permitted
to
go
trial.
mr.
gideon
kanner
i
presume
they
do.
the
point
--
our
--
our
point
here
is,
your
honor,
however,
that
we're
dealing
with
a
legislative
enactment.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
zoning
--
an
extensive
zoning
ordinance
of
--
that
covers
a
wide
area.
and
after
this
court's
ruling
in
the
forest
city
enterprises
case
and
parallel
california
cases,
which
are
cited
on
the
briefs,
that
is
a
purely
legislative
act,
so
that
there
were
no
administrative
remedies
to
exhaust.
this
ordinance,
the
--
the
legislation
itself,
does
not
set
up
any
administrative
review
proceedings
--
procedure,
so
that
one
could
do
it
only
in
the
same
sense
that
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
were
to
adopt
an
unconstitutional
statute,
one
can
say
--
one
could
say,
“well,
why
don't
you
go
to
sacramento
and
ask
them
to
change
it
before
you
challenge
it
in
court?”
now,
as
i
understand
this
court's
precedents,
that
is
euclid
versus
ambler,
which
was
quite
explicit
on
the
point
that
is
not
required
to
be
done.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
correct.
this
court
does
not
know
it
on
this
record.
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
may
i
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
was
directed,
your
honor,
to
the
second
count,
to
the
declaratory
relief
count
and
under
california
or
law
of
remedies
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
this
court
and
nectow
verus
cambridge,
said,
“the
quite,
the
contrary.”
in
that
case,
that
is
precisely
what
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
said
and
this
court
disagreed
and
said
that,
“the
owner
was
--
had
to
be
permitted
as
he
was
there
permitted,
which
we
were
not,
to
put
on
evidence
and
satisfy
a
triumph
of
fact
that
notwithstanding
such
language
in
the
ordinance,”
he
in
fact
was
not
able
to
put
the
property
to
uses
which
would
be
economically
valuable
that
would
give
him
a
reasonable
to
return.
mr.
gideon
kanner
on
--
that's
not
quite
our
position.
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
number
one,
there
are
two
causes
of
action
involved
there.
this
one
was
directed
only
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
so
that
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“since
the
ordinance
on
its
face
allows
something,
it
is
not
amenable
to
challenge
by
declaratory
relief
under
california
law.”
however,
that
leaves
unanswered,
the
first
cause
of
action
which
is
the
nectow
versus
cambridge
approach,
in
which
we
say,
“notwithstanding
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
let
us
look
at
the
facts.”
suppose
the
legislature
or
the
local
city
was
to
make
some
--
let's
--
let's
hypothesize
a
bad
face
situation,
in
which
they
zone
a
swampland
for
--
for
high
rise
office
buildings.
now,
would
not
the
owner
then
be
permitted
to
come
into
court
and
put
on
evidence
and
say,
“look,
it's
impossible
to
build
office
buildings
on
that
land.”
we
make
the
same
argument,
except
that
our
argument
goes
to
the
economics
and
to
value
the
property
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
of
course.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that's
--
that's
a
point
of
some
importance
by
this
--
an
allegation
of
this
complaint
not
that
the
value
has
been
diminished,
which
incidentally
ought
to
be
enough.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
under
this
court's
opinion
in
central
eureka
mining,
but
we're
alleging
that
it
went
beyond
that.
that
the
property
has
been
deprived
of
all
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
value
and
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
utility.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
practicalities
of
the
matter.
let
me
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
with
--
there
is
a
--
a
fairly
well
settled
body
of
state
law
and
federal
law
that
is
and
to
the
extent
the
federal
courts
have
considered
it.
we've
cited
some
of
it
in
the
brief,
the
most
recent
one
in
california
being
dahl
versus
city
of
palo
alto,
which
discusses
california
law
on
that
point.
and
there's
a
well
recognized
doctrine
of
utility.
and
that
is
that
if
the
position
of
the
public
body
as
such,
that
is
manifest,
that
they
have
no
intention
of
allowing
it.
one
is
not
required
to
perform
an
idle
act.
and
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
dahl
case,
if
it's
--
the
facts
are
virtually
identical.
there,
the
city
of
palo
alto
pretty
much
said,
“we
want
those
foothills
left
open.
that's
going
to
be
open
space,
there
will
be
view
shed
for
our
city
park
and
that's
that.”
mr.
gideon
kanner
just
about,
may
i
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
page
32
of
the
appendix
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
contains
some
of
these
standards
as
the
ordinance
puts
it.
take
a
look
at
this
for
example,
“land
to
be
preserved
as
open
space
shall
be
maintained
as
permanent
open
space
by
dedication
to
the
city,
a
fee
title
or
of
scenic
easements,
by
deed
restriction
approved
by
the
city
attorney
or
by
other
methods
acceptable
to
the
city.”
now,
we
have
here
a
piece
of
property,
if
it's
going
to
be
one
house
per
5-acres,
we're
talking
here
about
a
--
an
estate
of
unimaginable
grandeur
in
that
part
of
the
country.
and
even
by
one
house
per
acre,
would
be
quite
lavish.
now,
we
have
to
sell
this
land
to
some
person
who
is
going
to
have
to
spend
a
fortune
and
then
he
discovers
that
he
has
to
dedicated
it
in
fee
to
the
city,
if
the
city
so
requires.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
i
--
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
--
there
is
going
to
be
one
house
per
acre.
again,
i'm
again,
that
the
disadvantage
being
bound
to
the
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
complaint.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that's
precisely
our
position.
if
all
these
arguments
from
--
for
--
from
the
other
side
on
that
point
are
correct,
then
obviously,
my
client
would've
lost
very
quickly,
possibly
by
summary
judgment,
if
it's
all
that
cut
and
dry.
now
--
and
we
--
we
--
as
i've
--
as
an
advocate,
i
certainly
inscribe
a
great
deal
of
significance
that
a
determined
effort
to
keep
my
clients
from
going
to
trial
and
to
put
on
their
evidence.
why?
if
the
evidence
is
all
that
bad,
they're
going
to
loss
like
that,
aren't
they?
but
the
evidence
is
not
all
that
bad
and
i
am
prevented
from
going
into
it
here
on
this
record.
mr.
gideon
kanner
no
sir,
your
honor.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
gideon
kanner
we
are
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
our
complaint
is
that
they
would
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
no,
your
honor.
our
complaint
is
that
they
wouldn't
let
us
put
on
evidence
of
federal
constitutional
violation.
mr.
gideon
kanner
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process,
taking
a
property
without
just
compensation.
mr.
gideon
kanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
gideon
kanner
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
have
a
day
in
court
to
put
on
this
evidence.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
it
wasn't
a
summary
judgment.
it
was
a
dismissal
here
on
the
pleading
without
leave
to
amend.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
of
course,
but
had
the
matter
gone
as
far
to
summary
judgment,
there
are
at
least
it
would
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
have
been
evidentiary
facts
before
the
courts.
mr.
gideon
kanner
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
have
been
complaining
then,
if
there
had
been
no
triable
issue
of
facts
and
only
an
issue
of
law.
lawyers
know
that
you
--
there's
always
a
winner
and
a
loser
in
every
case,
so
you
lose.
mr.
gideon
kanner
there
was
no
opportunity
ever
to
make
one,
because
this
was
on
a
general
demurrer.
mr.
gideon
kanner
your
honor,
under
california
law
what
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
your
honor,
that
is
not
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
permitted
under
california
law.
that
is
a
general
demurrer.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
may
i
make
--
may
i
use
a
hypothesis,
your
honor?
suppose
we
had
a
criminal
prosecution
in
which
the
defendant
wants
to
offer
evidence
that
he
was
in
fact
coerced
into
confessing
and
he
is
met
by
some
state
statute,
which
says
that
a
--
that
a
--
the
existence
of
a
written
confession
is
--
is
presumptive,
is
conclusive.
and
he
is
not
then
permitted
to
offer
any
evidence.
now,
surely
we
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
with
that
would
we?
mr.
gideon
kanner
[laughter]
well,
may
i
point
out
this.
there
--
there
is
nevertheless,
a
similarity,
your
honor.
we
were
never
permitted
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
we
were
never
--
perhaps,
only
that,
but
we
were
never
permitted
to
put
on
evidence
or
even
to
plead
in
amended
form
any
additional
facts
to
show
that
in
fact,
this
ordinance
deprives
the
owner
of
all
reasonable
use
and
value.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
we
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
and
only
could've
tried,
we
looked
down
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor,
they
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
precisely.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that's
precisely
what
happened.
it's
exactly
like
nectow
versus
cambridge.
we
have
an
ordinance
which
on
its
face
permits
a
use,
but
once
the
trier
of
fact
heard
it,
he
realized
that
that
ostensibly
permitted
years
was
in
fact,
economically
impossible.
the
owner
would
be
locked
into
perpetually
money-losing
position.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
that
are
--
those
are
the
allegations
or
the
complaint.
mr.
gideon
kanner
and
that
is
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
gideon
kanner
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
--
my
argument.
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
court
has
simply
said
that
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
it
didn't
care
to
deal
with
that.
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
taking
without
just
compensation,
the
court
said
that
my
clients
could
not
recover
any
just
compensation
because
their
only
remedy
was
in
validation
and
then
in
a
rather
surprising
turn
of
events,
the
california
supreme
court
without
saying
so,
revived
the
common
law
form
of
action
approach.
and
then
because
my
client
asked
for
the
wrong
remedy,
affirmed
a
dismissal,
which
was
a
startling
development,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
gideon
kanner
inverse
condemnation,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
correct.
mr.
gideon
kanner
on
its
face.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
sir.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
sir.
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
second
cause
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
second
cause
of
action
was
not
amended
for
that
very
reason,
your
honor.there
isn't
really
much
to
be
said,
but
under
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
no
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
respond
to,
your
honor.
under
california
law
when
you
go
in
declaratory
relief,
you
may
only
challenge
what
is
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
so,
that
is
candidly,
that
was
a
secondary
consideration
to
our
side
of
the
case
because
the
face
of
the
ordinance
did
say
all
those
things
that
you
could
build.
back
to
nectow
versus
cambridge,
that
was
a
formidable
barrier
to
us.
we
had
to
have
an
opportunity
to
put
on
evidence
and
to
show
that
de
facto.
those
are
ostensibly
permitted.
here,
is
where
economically
and
in
one
instance
physically
unachievable.
and
to
--
in
order
to
do
that
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
that
was
--
that
was
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
pleaded
on
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
were
not
allowed
to
plead
any
evidentiary
facts
of
course.
even
if
there
had
been
an
amendment.
mr.
gideon
kanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
the
second
cause
of
action,
your
honor,
is
only
directed
to
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
that
is
where
we
may
not.
we
simply
may
not,
it
is
forbidden
under
california
law
to
deal
with
the
constitutionality
as
applied.
for
that,
until
the
california
supreme
spoke
--
court's
spoke
in
this
case,
the
sole
remedy
was
to
go
in
inverse
condemnation
or
mandamus.
and
in
this
case
they
eliminated
the
inverse
condemnation
remedy.
so
that
under
the
second
cause
of
action,
it
was
simply
--
it
was
the
wrong
tool
for
the
jobs
so
to
speak,
in
california.
one
click
cannot
go
behind
the
face
of
the
ordinance
on
declaratory
relief.
it
is
only
a
facial
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
that's
what
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
there
was
a
way
to
tender
it
the
way
we
did
and
that
been
fact.
mr.
gideon
kanner
they
inverse
condemnation,
indeed,
your
honor.
that
we
allege
--
we
alleged
the
ultimate
facts
that
the
effect
of
the
ordinance
and
the
other
activities
and
i
do
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
the
other
activities.
the
property
was
rendered,
worthless
and
useless
and
those
were
the
ultimate
facts.
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gideon
kanner
the
complaint
as
contained
in
a
joint
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
gideon
kanner
it
is
--
begins
at
page
3,
that's
brief
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
no,
your
honor.
i
have
been
driven
to
respond
in
a
way
which
i'm
not
sure
as
proper,
but
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
when
this
case
was
being
argued
before
the
california
supreme
court,
mr.
hearn,
who
was
arguing
the
case,
offered
to
dismiss
the
action
right
then
and
there,
on
a
stipulation
that
one
house
per
acre
could
be
built.
and
no
such
stipulation
was
proffered.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
a
matter
of
physical
impossibility.
the
offsite
improvements
necessary
for
the
construction
of
one
house
on
that
parcel
would
make
it
so
expensive
that
no
one
could
afford
it.
that's
--
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
now,
again,
i
--
i
apologize
if
i
transgress
the
boundary
of
the
record,
but
that's
the
sort
of
evidentiary
matters
that
we
would
have
to
go
into
to
--
to
persuade
a
trier
of
fact
as
was
done
in
nectow
versus
cambridge,
that
in
fact,
that's
just
can't
be
done.
no
matter
what
that
ordinance
says.
i
--
i
did
want
to
emphasize
the
other
activities
that
took
place
here
and
that
is
something
which
this
court
has
never
considered
and
that
is
the
impact
of
the
pre-condemnation
activities
of
the
government,
which
is
not
content
just
to
go
ahead
and
condemn
land
when
they
want
to,
but
on
the
contrary,
they
go
ahead
and
they
make
announcement
and
they
get
--
they
get
studies
and
they
get
planners.
and
it's
all
widely
reported
in
the
press.
this
property
is
being
acquired
by
the
city.
this
went
on
for
a
period
of
years
here.
who
in
--
in
the
market
is
going
to
be
foolish
enough
to
spend
good
money
to
buy
land
which
the
city
has
announced,
repeatedly,
definitively,
“this
is
an
indispensable
part
of
open
space
city
resources.
we
are
going
to
acquire
it”
and
in
fact,
they
went
ahead,
adopt
the
condemnation
resolution,
brought
the
condemnation
action.
and
it
was
then
only
when
confronting
the
value
of
this
land,
because
it
is
a
very
desirable
part
of
the
country
and
they
abandoned
the
condemnation
and
chose
to
stand
on
this
ordinance,
but
accomplishes
the
very
same
thing,
the
passive
use.
now,
if
the
government
wants
to
go
in
and
build
a
road
on
somebody's
property
obviously,
they
--
they
have
to
enter
at
some
point
and
do
it.
but
if
the
use
that
is
desired
by
the
government
is
a
passive
one,
such
as
open
space,
they
don't
have
to,
they
don't
have
to
cross
the
--
the
close.
they
don't
have
to
set
that
tow
on
the
property.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
my
understanding
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
where
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
your
honor,
again,
we
get
back
to
the
point
of
we
have
here
an
extensive
record
of
city
commitments
suggest
the
exact
position.
and
there
is
again,
a
very
clear
matter
of
utility
--
doctrine
of
utility.
i
--
this
had
never
arose
that
reason
in
the
briefing
here
and
i
think
if
the
court
means
that
appropriate,
i
would
request
leave
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
question
of
the
--
the
lack
of
needs
to
pursue
administrative
remedies,
even
if
they
are
available,
which
they
are
not
here,
by
the
way.
but
even
if
they're
available,
they
need
not
be
exhausted
when
there
is
a
clear-cut
case
of
utility,
which
we
suggest
we
have
here
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
in
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
in
california,
that's
quite
a
major
undertaking
which
in
this
case
it
cause
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
we
--
because
we
have
here
longstanding
city
announcement
that
of
commitment
to
the
acquisition
of
this
property
for
its
open
space
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
i
again,
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
language
of
the
ordinance
at
pages
32
and
33
of
the
appendix
or
jurisdictional
statement.
and
the
--
the
city
has
a
--
a
--
there
are
some
four
subparagraphs
under
each
of
them
the
--
any
--
any
construction
can
be
turned
down
under
the
most
vague
and
subjective
criteria
imaginable,
to
minimize
visual
impact
for
example.
in
any
event,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
other
mode
of
the
city
activity,
that
is
quite
critical
and
i
see
that
it
did
not
capture
the
court's
mind
as
much
as
the
first
issue.
nevertheless,
that
is
the
kind
of
pragmatic
issue,
which
the
market
reacts
to
very
strongly.
and
because
nobody
wants
to
buy
land
that
has
a
lawsuit
attached
to
it
and
nobody
wants
to
buy
land
which
is
under
a
cloud
of
a
condemnation,
nobody
wants
to
buy
land
that
the
city
has
shown
a
definite
interest
in
and
has
committed
itself,
as
clear
as
can
be
on
this
record
even
without
going
into
the
evidentiary
facts,
which
incidentally
go
even
further
than
this
record.
but
we
have
here
two
studies
by
two
consultants
we
have
the
appropriation
of
funds,
we
have
the
issuance
of
bronzes,
we
have
a
condemnation
resolution,
we
have
an
actual
on
again,
off
again
condemnation,
which
in
this
cases
is
often
a
very
common
device,
bring
the
condemnation,
then
abandon
it,
then
bring
it
later,
at
a
later
date
and
so
on.
mr.
gideon
kanner
there
was
reimbursed
for
the
attorney's
fees
and
--
and
litigation
expenses.
he
was
not
reimbursed
of
course,
for
any
loss
of
value
to
the
property
or
any
--
any
constitutional
laws.
that
was
just
--
that's
just
attorney's
fees
and
expert
fees.
so
that,
that
--
that
side
of
the
case
particularly
when
combined
i
think,
i
better
reserve
my
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
with
court's
permission.
mr.
gideon
kanner
may
it
please
the
court.
most
remarkable
argument,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
demurrer
was
sustained.
they're
arguing
rise
to
traditional
anglo-american
issue
of
pure
law.
and
yet,
virtually,
all
we
have
been
arguing
about
this
facts.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
may
i
respectfully
point
up
and
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
basic
american
seminal
case,
euclid
versus
ambler,
whereat
272
u.s.
386.
that
very
issue
was
presented.
the
court
said,
“a
motion
was
made
in
the
court
below
to
dismiss
the
bill
on
the
grounds
that
because
the
complainant
had
made
no
effort
to
obtain
a
building
permit
or
applied
to
the
zoning
board
of
appeals
for
relief,
as
it
might
have
done
under
the
terms
of
the
ordinance,
the
suit
was
premature.”
the
motion
was
properly
overruled.
the
effect
of
the
allegations
to
the
bill
is
that
the
ordinance
on
its
own
force
operates
greatly
to
reduce
the
value
of
appellee's
land
and
destroy
their
marketability
for
industrial,
commercial
and
residential
uses.”
i
won't
go
on
to
the
quotation.
we
were
and
still
are
relying
on
that
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
would
have
to
overrule
not
only
nectow
versus
cambridge,
but
euclid
as
well,
to
deprive
ourselves
of
an
opportunity
to
rely
on
that,
what
was
until
now,
a
clear
principle
of
law.
may
i
touch
on
the
--
on
just
of
a
couple
of
facts?
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
wanted
to
make
very
clear
that
in
responding
to
your
question,
sir,
i
intended
to
indicate
that
even
one
--
one
house
cannot
be
built
because
of
the
prohibit
of
cost
of
our
offsite
improvements,
that
is
a
large
5-acre
parcel
on
a
ridge
and
in
order
to
prepare
it
and
provide
access
to
it,
utilities
and
so
on,
it
would
be
prohibited.
now,
as
to
the
--
the
question
also,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
commented
on
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion
as
to
what
they
did
decide.
may
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
page
9
in
the
appendix
that
a
jurisdictional
statement
where
they
tell
us
as
to
that
first
part
of
the
opinion.
in
hfh
ltd.,
we
specifically
noted
that,
“this
case
does
not
present
and
we
therefore
do
not
decide
the
question
of
entitlement
to
compensation
in
the
event
a
zoning
regulation
forbade
substantially
all,”
that's
emphasized,
“substantially
all
use
of
a
land
in
question,
we
leave
that
question
for
another
day.”
that
was
the
hfh
quotation.
they
now
go
on
and
say,
“we
now
reached
that
issue.
they
did
reach
that
issue
as
to
what
happens
when
substantially
all
use
of
his
owned
land
is
destroyed.”
so
i
respectfully
disagree
with
my
colleague
and
i
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
passage
because
there,
the
california
supreme
court
tells
us
expressly
what
they
did
reach
and
which
they
did
decide.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that's
right.
mr.
gideon
kanner
well
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
well,
but
yet,
that
was
the
--
that
is
what
made
agins
versus
tiburon
the
landmark
california
case.
mr.
gideon
kanner
so
we
now
wind
up
and
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
we
wind
up,
your
honor
and
i'm
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gideon
kanner
that
would
be
beyond
my
meager
powers,
but
may
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
that's
--
that
leads
us
however,
into
a
very
anomalous
position
whereby
as
counsel
says,
“the
california
supreme
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
even
reach
all
these
stuff
and
yet
they
did
and
yet
they
decided.”
can
you
imagine
a
california
lawyer
walking
into
a
trial
court
and
saying,
“pay
no
attention
to
what
our
supreme
court
said,
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
it.”
and
manifestly,
the
court
intended
to
decide
this,
did
decide
it
and
told
us
in
so
many
words
that
they
did
decide
it.
the
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
i
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i'm
an
appellate
lawyer
and
i
--
i
don't
deal
with
that
--
mr.
gideon
kanner
--
i
suppose
so
i
see
no
reason
why
not.
mr.
gideon
kanner
oh,
i'm
sure
you
can
apply
whether
it'll
be
granted
is
another
story.
thank
you,
your
honor.
