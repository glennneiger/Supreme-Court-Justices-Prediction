mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
also
would
like
to
review
the
significant
allegations
of
the
complaint.
it
is
alleged
that
the
appellants
bought
the
property
for
residential
use
and
as
the
court
has
observed,
the
california
supreme
court
required
that
it
be
made
available
for
residential
use,
by
the
construction
that
placed
upon
the
zoning
ordinance.
that
is
at
least,
one
home
must
be
allowed
by
the
city
and
up
to
five
maybe
allowed
by
the
city
under
the
terms
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
it
must
be
recalled
that
complaint
alleges
that
the
city
of
tiburon
has
the
highest
values
of
land
for
residential
purposes
of
any
place
in
california
and
that
these
land
of
appellants
has
the
highest
values
within
the
city.
so,
we're
talk
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
california
supreme
court
took
judicial
notice
at
the
zoning
ordinance
and
under
california
law
and
federal
cases
who
have
done
the
same,
in
effect,
considered
the
terms
of
the
zoning
ordinance
to
be
a
part
of
the
complaint
or
a
part
of
the
record
before
the
court.
construe
those
ordinances
as
requiring
the
city
to
allow
residential
use,
then
determine
under
the
substantive
test
for
encroachment
upon
private
rights
that
the
--
the
remaining
available
reasonable
use
rendered
nugatory
that
allegation.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
ordinances
are
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
an
incorrect
contention.
the
city
--
there's
no
indication
that
the
city
would
not
consider
such
an
application
on
its
merits
and
perhaps
grant
up
to
five
residential
units.
one
of
the
key
parts
of
the
city's
position
is
that
it
should
be
able
to
preserve
its
process.
it
calls
for
the
submission
of
a
master
plan
and
then
it
would
act
on
the
master
plan
as
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
for
the
--
up
to
five
units.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
because
the
zoning
ordinance
calls
for
a
maximum
density
of
one
home
per
acre,
which
if
the
land
values
are
such
as
has
been
alleged,
would
certainly,
yield
very
substantial
values.
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
so,
what
we
say
is
the
city
can't
very
well
indicate
in
advance,
how
many
units
it
would
approve
because
the
necessary
environmental
review
hasn't
occurred.
there's
no
way
to
know
the
physical
circumstances
and
enough
detail
to
indicate
how
many
units
might
be
approved,
but
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
has
said,
“residential
use
must
be
approved
from
one
to
five
units.”
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
actually,
an
alternative
ground
of
the
demurrer
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
which
under
california
law,
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
the
administrative
remedy
is
jurisdictional.and
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
city's
demurrer
was
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
precisely
because
of
the
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
implicitly
did
in
the
sense
that
it
also
refused
to
speculate
as
to
how
many
units
might
be
appropriate
by
court
action
prior
to
administrative
of
action.
and
by
construing
the
ordinance
on
its
face
said,
“that
is
what
is
before
us,
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance.”
now,
it
might
be
applied
in
circumstances
that
would
call
on
this
ordinance
for
the
submission
of
a
master
plan.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
choice
to
submit
a
master
plan
is
that
of
the
owner
and
could've
been
undertaken
at
any
time.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct
and
a
further
point
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is
under
the
california
government
code
and
they
have
the
numbers
transverse,
65950.
there
is
a
time
limit
established
under
california
law.
an
agency
can
take
no
more
than
one
year
for
any
kind
of
action
such
as
this
and
as
encouraged
to
take
less
time.
so,
had
the
application
been
submitted,
it
could
not
have
just
been
suspended
indefinitely.
and
the
penalty
for
an
agency's
failure
to
act
is
that
the
application
is
deemed
to
prove
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
after
a
one
year
period,
but
that's
on
a
statewide
basis.
any
kind
of
project
and
there's
a
legislative
finding
which
encourages
agencies
to
take
an
even
shorter
period
of
time.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
respond
to
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
any
improprieties
that
occurred
in
this
--
in
the
amount
of
dedication
or
the
form
of
dedication
which
the
city
asked
for
during
the
process,
then
the
court
would
be
aware
of
the
issues
and
the
illegal
questions
that
would
be
presented
and
it
could
litigated
following
the
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
in
other
words,
if
owner's
dedication
requirements
that
were
unreasonable
under
any
standard
were
imposed,
the
--
the
owner
could
litigate
that
following
the
city's
action.
so,
that
really
ties
into
the
exhaustion
point
and
becomes
kind
of
an
element
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
no.
ordinarily,
there
would
not
be,
because
the
compensation
--
this
will
be
an
aspect
of
the
approval
for
--
of
the
activity
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
and
part
dedications,
dedications
for
roadways
and
such
as
that
have
generally
been
held
to
be
non-compensable.
but
you
see,
in
all
candor,
i
don't
see
how
that
issue
can
be
considered
before
the
court
at
this
point,
because
we
can't
presume
that
the
city
would
require
an
extraordinary
or
unfair
illegal
amount
of
dedication.
that
would
have
to
wait
and
see
what
occurs.
and
also,
the
open
space
process
is
contemplated
by
california
law,
in
this
circumstance,
calls
for
a
balance
between
preservation
of
open
space
resources
whatever
they
maybe,
in
california
that
would
include
vest
amounts
of
agricultural
land,
lands
which
is
subject
to
landslide
or
earthquake
and
it
might
very
appropriate
to
require
dedications
under
some
circumstances
to
preserve
the
very
open
space
features,
which
the
law
identifies.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
the
california
supreme
court
took
that
demurrer
together
with
the
city's
zoning
ordinances
and
pointed
out
that
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
ordinance
has
allowed
use.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
to
show
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
there's
a
very
strong
policy
here,
of
protecting
zoning
and
land
use
regulation
affirm
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
in
terms
of
substantive
process.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
and
his
further
response
as
i
recall
was
that
if
he
--
if
they
were
allowed
to
build
five,
they
would
--
that
would
satisfy
their
expectations.
and
our
contention
is
the
owner
has
every
right
to
litigate
all
constitutional
issues.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
it's
a
matter
of
timing
and
when.
should
an
owner
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
allege
that
a
complaint
constitutes
a
taking
on
conclusory
facts,
where
the
zoning
that's
apparently
allowed
would
be
about
one
unit
per
acre?
frustrate
the
normal
planning
processes
and
carry
that
matter
to
trial.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
they
could
have
throughout
this
proceeding.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
the
--
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
it
might
--
i
--
i
believe
the
court
maybe
interested
in
some
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
complaint,
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
most
of
those
issues
really
aren't
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
they
passed
the
ordinance
and
also,
your
honor,
there
was
the
imminent
domain
action,
which
was
filed
and
terminated.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance
is
an
issue
and
the
ruling
of
the
california
court
was
that
the
zoning
ordinance
satisfied
substantive
due
process
test,
did
not
encroach
on
--
on
private
property
rights,
because
of
the
available
use
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
and
further
observes
that
it
could
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
with
the
exception
that
the
character
of
the
area
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
respectfully
submit,
no,
your
honor,
because
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
themselves
indicate
the
nature
of
this
land,
the
high
values
of
the
land
for
residential
use.
one
acre
zoning
is
not
uncommon.
this
--
what
really
constitutes
an
attempt
to
thwart
the
normal
process
and
litigate
right
at
the
front
of
the
process,
rather
than
going
through
the
planned
process
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
that
would
have
been
you're
a
classic
case
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
of
physical
invasion
and
that
requires
compensation,
but
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
that
kind
of
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
but
those
are
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
to
the
extent
the
complaint
equates
this
zoning
with
a
physical
use,
it's
really
making
a
legal
argument
and
not
--
not
a
factual
argument
and
that
is
why
we
think
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
in
a
circumstance
such
as
that,
it
might
be
appropriate
to
go
beyond
the
demurrer
stage
and
that
is
why
i've
concentrated
on
the
facts,
because
i
don't
believe
that
that
can
be
fairly
said
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that
is
what
the
court
held
and
it's
our
position
that
the
--
that
establishes
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance
by
indicating
a
substantial
use
and
the
potential
for
up
to
five
homes.
the
city's
zoning
ordinance
contemplates
a
planning
review
process
--
who
--
process
which
is
never
been
involved.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
yes,
it
would,
your
honor,
because
following
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
all
issues
tendered
in
that
proceeding
would
be
before
a
court
for
review.
now,
we
might
have
a
quarrel
over
the
remedy,
but
the
issues
could
be
litigated.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
case
could've
been
resolved
on
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
ordinance.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
it
implicitly
was
because
the
court
construed
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance
which
under
california
law,
can
be
attacked
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
by
declaratory
relief.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
and
did
not
reach,
the
as
applied
issue,
which
is
an
aspect
of
exhaustion.
if
california
courts
saying,
“we
will
not
do
that
until
there
has
been
exhaustion,
we
are
there
--
if
we
do
it,
we
are
missing
the
sifting
and
refinement
and
elimination
of
issues
which
occurred.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct.
so,
a
large
part
of
our
position
as
i've
indicated
before
is
to
try
to
protect
the
sanctity
of
the
city's
planning
zoning
process.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
facts
to
the
case
also
indicate
that
a
significant
portion
of
the
city
of
tiburon
was
zoned
in
this
manner,
with
the
same
rpd-1
zoning.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
a
circumstance
where
appellant's
property
was
the
sole
property
put
into
the
zoning
district.
and
in
terms
of
the
substantive
validity
of
the
ordinance
in
addition
to
the
notion
of
reasonable
use
remaining
to
the
property
owner,
there
is
a
classic,
we
submit,
instance
of
reciprocity
here.
the
appellant's
properties
would
benefit
by
the
grading
controls
and
the
density
restrictions
and
all
as
they
would
be
applied
to
neighboring
property.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
it
was
required
--
passed
after
they
acquired
the
property.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
your
honor,
the
zoning
prior
to
that
time
is
not
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
go
somewhat
outside
the
record
and
point
out
and
then
one
of
the
amici
briefs
said
the
conservation
foundation
they
included
as
an
appendix.
the
prior
zoning
which
was
one
acre
zoning
ro-1.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
yes,
your
honor.
except
even
at
that
time
in
california,
there
was
the
subdivision
map
act,
which
requires
going
through
an
approval
process,
certain
findings
have
to
be
made
in
order
disallow
the
maximum
density
and
there
is
the
california
environmental
quality
act,
which
was
in
effect
to
that
time.
so,
it
would
not
have
been
automatic
even
then
that
they
would've
received
five,
but
their
expectations
certainly
cannot
have
been
much
damaged
by
the
change
in
the
zoning.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
following
completion
of
the
administrative
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
process?
i
don't
think
the
california
court
had
an
opinion
on
that
question
because
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
it
--
more,
it
includes
the
idea
that
it
might
allow
up
to
five
and
looking
it
at
that
way,
it
would
be
valid
and
we
don't
know
until
the
process
is
completed.
and
what
evidence
would
come
forward
in
the
administrative
process
would
dictate
the
court's
response
to
subsequent
litigation.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
the
city
would
be
astute
and
fair
enough
to
realize
that
if
the
good
case
was
made
in
the
planning
process,
that
one
home
was
totally
uneconomic
that
they
would
allow
additional
homes.
i
think
that's
part
of
the
reason
and
benefit
of
--
of
(voice
overlap)
letting
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
--
this
process
go
forward.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
we
are
through
with
that,
but
possibly,
yes.
i
just
like
to
mention
briefly
this
--
this
remedy
question
which
has
been
much
briefed.
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
that
this
ordinance
is
valid
on
--
on
its
face
or
this
case
could
be
considered
one
were
administrative
remedy
should
be
exhausted
and
of
course,
the
question
of
what
remedy
to
invoke
following
an
unconstitutional
action
or
an
encroachment
on
private
property
rights
would
not
be
presented.
but
the
concept
of
the
remedy
to
be
applied
to
regulation
is
really
based
on
the
need
to
accommodate
two
very
strong
powers.
one
is
the
power
to
regulate
which
this
court
has
observed
to
be
one
of
the
list
limitable
powers
of
government.
in
fact,
local
zoning
authority
has
been
observed
to
be
about
the
most
essential
power
held
by
local
government.
and
where
that
power
comes
into
conflict
with
protected
property
rights,
then
there
are
no
absolutes
involved.
what
is
necessary
is
to
engage
in
the
balancing.
and
we
submit
that
the
proper
balance
to
be
struck
in
that
circumstance
is
to
invalidate
the
offending
measure
that
preserves
that
police
power
as
an
essential
power
and
it
provides
fairness
to
the
property
owner
in
the
sense
that
a
property
owner
normally
does
not
commence
development
procedure
or
process
with
the
idea
of
having
the
city
and
buying
his
property.
he
commences
that
process
with
the
idea
of
commencing
some
development.invalidation
allows
him
to
go
forward
with
some
form
of
development.
also
under
california
law,
declaratory
relief
and
mandate
have
priority
on
the
court
calendar.
so
it's
much
faster
to
receive
a
judicial
resolution
of
these
kinds
of
conflicts
to
declaratory
relief
and
mandamus
than
it
is
to
go
inverse
condemnation
which
can
stick
around
on
a
trial
calendar
for
a
good
long
time.
so,
we
think
it's
an
appropriate
constitutional
balance
between
these
two
strong
interest
and
we
submit
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
essentially,
the
payment
of
compensation
or
money
damages
is
a
legislative
choice.
and
that
is
an
aspect
to
the
separation
of
powers
since
legislatures
under
our
structure
of
government
are
the
ones
that
appropriate
and
expend
public
funds.
and
in
this
cases
which
don't
have
to
do
with
the
police
power,
u.s.
trust
versus
new
jersey,
involving
the
impairment
of
bondholders'
rights.
perhaps
somewhat
a
kin
to
interference
with
investment-backed
expectations
as
discussed
in
penn
central.
the
court
was
careful
to
note
that
while
invalidating
new
jersey's
repeal,
the
state
of
new
jersey
was
not
frustrated
in
trying
to
carryout
its
new
public
policy.
it
could
invoke
its
power
of
eminent
domain
and
compensate
effective
property
interest
and
proceed
with
its
new
policy.
the
critical
point
there
is
that
it
was
a
matter
of
legislative
choice,
not
court
decree,
that
compensation
would
be
paid.
so
it
was
reserved
to
the
legislature
as
a
legislative
matter.
and
finally,
i
would
notice,
this
has
been
noted
in
cases
involving
the
civil
rights
act,
the
prospectively
chilling
effect
that
monetary
damages
would
have
in
circumstances
where
there
cannot
be
easily
anticipated.
where
to
be
inadvertent
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
in
the
circumstance
such
as
these
zoning
ordinances
where
you're
dealing
with
a
regulatory
act
that
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
think
that
where
a
state
moves
or
local
agency
moves
by
eminent
domain,
it's
not
a
regulatory
act.
that
isn't
--
that
is
the
exercise
of
sort
of
proprietary
direct
governmental
powers,
not
adjusting
the
public
good,
but
moving
to
the
benefit
of
government.
i
don't
think
a
physical
invasion
of
property
by
government
is
necessarily
a
--
a
regulatory
act.
so,
ours
--
our
point
is
that
in
the
area
of
pure
regulation
which
is
intending
to
adjust
the
public
good
whether
it
been
in
environmental
law
or
some
other
area,
that
the
approached
should
be
that
if
it
goes
too
far
under
certain
circumstances,
it
would
be
an
invalid
act.
precisely,
because
it's
unaccompanied
by
the
just
compensation
that
would
be
necessary
to
sustain
an
invasion
of
guaranteed
property
rights.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
decision
to
proceed
in
eminent
domain
is
a
legislative
decision
and
then
the
process
of
determining
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct
and
of
course
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
but
the
key
aspect
is
that
the
choice
to
expend
public
funds
by
beginning
the
proceedings
starts
with
the
legislative
body.
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
respect
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
still
the
ordinance
says
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct.
unless
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
saying
is
a
guaranteed
minimum
of
one
and
anything
above
that,
the
city
might
grant
in
taking
that
as
a
totality.
we
think
this
ordinance
is
not
invalid.
why
don't
you
folks
go
to
the
planning
department?
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
in
fact,
i
know
the
court's
opinion
does
not
discuss
administrative
remedies,
but
i
think
implicit
in
the
court's
ruling
was
the
notion
of,
“we
will
take
today
the
facial
validity
of
this
ordinance.”
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
and
we
will
not
anticipate
how
many
units
might
be
approved
because
that
is
something
which
would
require
the
completion
of
its
planning
process.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
there
just
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
why
--
that's
why
i
think
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
so
important.
they
alleged
that
this
land
has
the
highest
residential
land,
virtually
of
any
land
in
the
state.
the
prospective
purchaser
looks
at
that
and
sees
the
possibility
of
up
to
one
unit
per
acre.
i
would
think
that
looks
fairly
attractive.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
not
only
this
planning
process,
but
a
modification
of
the
zoning
would
always
be
possible
too.
and
i
think
that
given
the
--
the
fake
--
the
facts
of
the
complaint,
the
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i
don't
dispute
that
your
honor,
but
i
think
--
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
i'm
not
in
an
appraiser
and
a
land
expert.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
true,
but
i
think
the
--
the
regulatory
authority
is
entitled
to
say,
“here's
a
piece
of
land
with
many
variables.
there
are
hazard
conditions
there.
there
are
possible
offsite
impacts
and
we
can't
know
in
advance
precisely
how
much
densities
should
be
allowed,
so
a
range
is
provided.”
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
that's
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clement
shute,
jr.
of
course,
just
my
brief,
your
honor.
thank
you.
