justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you?
what
do
you
do
about
the
statement
by
your
supreme
court
and
california
that
says,
“according
to
the
wording
of
the
ordinance
at
which
we
may
take
note,
the
rpd-1
zoning
allows
plaintiff
to
build
between
one
and
five
residences
on
their
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
belies
plaintiff's
claim
that
development
of
their
land
is
forever
prevented
and
that's
the
--
that's
what
the
supreme
court
in
california
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
won't
care
whether
it
was
directed
to.
it
says
that
--
that
it
was
--
that--
that
under
the
zoning
ordinance,
you
can
build
one
to
five
houses?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
--
you
say,
we
should
just
--
that
we
--
that
we
just
shouldn't
accept
the
statement
as
to
what
the
zoning
ordinance
does
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
economic
reality,
we'll
just
--
we'll
just
mean
that
you
cannot
develop,
develop,
but
even
if
you
could
build
one
house
per
acre,
that
you're
--
that
just
won't
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
tried
to
prove
that
this
--
that
under
this
ordinance,
you
could
--
that
the
land
was
unusable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
--
you
would
have
just
as
an
economic
matter
or
you
just
couldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
so
in
effect,
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
device,
and
a
--
and
an
effective
device
to
maintain
open
spaces
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
without
paying
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ask
the
--
did
make
you
make
this
argument
before
the
california
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
did
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
you
--
did
you
say
that
you
were,
you
were
denied
--
being
denied
due
process
by
not
--
not
being
able
to
put
on
your
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
ignore
it
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
you
to
say
awhile
ago
that
if
it
were
stipulated
that
--
that
you
could
build
five
house,
one
house
per
--
per
acre,
that
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
then
you
would
say
the
economically
feasible
to
develop
to
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
be
no
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
--
what's
the
clear-cut
case
of
utility?
suppose
you
applied
for
--
what
do
you
do,
apply
for
a
building
permit
to
or
you
filed
a
plot
or
you
filed
a
--
you
do
something
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
the
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
whatever
it
is
--
let's
assume
you
--
why
do
you
say
it
would
be
futile?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
--
you
think
they
would
just
turn
you
down
to
--
to
build
five
houses?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
--
until
there
had
been
some
attempt
to
--
to
get
a
plan
approved,
you
couldn't
really
tell
how
the
ordinance
was
going
to
be
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence,
the
only
issue
that
was
left
was
the
facial
validity.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
all
of
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
we
say
as
applied
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
say
--
if
you
say
--
if
-
if
owner
applies
for
--
files
this
plan
and
says,
“i
want
to
build
five
houses.”
and
the
city
says,
“awfully,
sorry,
but
you
can
only
build
one.”
he
--
he
could
then
say,
“well,
this
ordinance
has
being
applied,
is
unconstitutional
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
this
is
economically
impossible.”
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
nature
zone
prior
to
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
in
this
opinion
that
this
ordinance
is
valid
even
if
the
city
will
permit
only
one
house
on
this
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
it
seemed
to
say
that
the
ordinance
is
valid
because
it
will
allow
one
to
five,
which
seems
to
include
that
it's
valid
even
if
--
even
if
the
city
allows
only
one
house
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
that
the
city's
position
is
that
however,
since
it
passed
this
ordinance
said
it
--
that
the
ordinance
would
be
valid,
even
if
it
permitted
only
one
house
on
this
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
rather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
rather
decide
maybe
to
take
the
land
and
pay
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me,
you
say
there
was
a
--
the
question
was
reduced
to
a
facial
attack
here.
actually,
no
one
--
no
one
claimed
that
this
ordinance
is
really
invalid
on
its
face
in
the
sense
that
it
couldn't
ever
be
applied
to
any
piece
of
property?
the
question
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
piece
of
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
let's
assume
the
judgment
--
let's
assume
the
supreme
court
had
--
had
ruled
in
--
in
the
plaintiff's
saver.
it
certainly
would
have
invalidated
the
ordinance
and
has
--
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
meant
that
the
ordinance
was
invalid
as
applied
to
a
lot
of
other
properties,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
about
this
piece
of
--
just
about
this
piece
--
about
this
piece
of
property.
and
as
it
stands
now
--
as
it
stands
now,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
it's
--
that
this
ordinance
does
not
amount
--
is
not
invalid
even
though
that
--
or
because
the
plaintiff
can
build
one
to
five
houses
on
his
property.
and
so,
who's
going
to
--
it
could
be
anybody
--
anybody
who
reads
this
would
think
that
the
ordinance
would
be
valid
even
if
the
city
allows
only
one
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
were
a
prospective
buyer
and
read
or
if
--
if
somebody
came
around
to
ask
you
to
buy
this
piece
of
property
and
you
said,
say
“well,
what
can
i
use
it
for?”
when
you
can
be
to
put
one
to
either
have
one
house
or
five
houses,
up
to
five
houses,
but
maybe
only
one?
well,
is
it
--
and
you
said
--
well,
how
i'm
going
to
find
out?
well,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
this
procedure.
so,
only
a
developer
can
--
only
the
one,
who
really
wants
to
develop,
but
can
find
--
can
find
out
whether
--
it
certainly
isn't
a
very
marketable
piece
of
property
in
its
present
condition,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
under
the
zoning
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
somebody
goes
through
this
--
this
operation
and
finds
out
whether
you
can
build
five
or
four
or
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
one
unit?
yes,
but
[laughs]
accepted
it,
you
may
only
have
one.
he
--
he
may
have
one
--
one
house
on
5
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
--
suppose,
this
property
were
put
on
the
market
under
this
decree
and
let's
assume
that
you
get
an
offer,
x,
the
highest
off
you
get
as
x.
now,
let's
suppose
that
instead
of
--
let's
suppose
that
the
property
was
--
was
subject
not
to
this
one
to
five
restriction,
but
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
you
could
build
five?
and
then
you
put
it
on
the
market,
you
think
you
can
get
a
higher
price
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
how
many
x?
10
x
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
--
well,
that's
it.
that's
really
what
they
--
that's
what
the
complaint
is
all
about
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that's
--
that's
--
they
--
they
were
there
talking
about
whether
you
could
get
damages
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
that
--
the
opinion
it's
on
the
assumption
there
was
a
taking,
can
you
get
a
--
can
you
get
damages
or
are
you
limited
to
do
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
reached
that
issue
and
we
don't
--
and
if
we
agree
there
is
a
taking
here,
i
suppose
we
don't
even
reach
this
part
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
maybe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
maybe
--
maybe
but
you
can't
--
but
we
don't
do
our
--
we
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
cram
issues
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
down
our
throat
because
we
don't
need
to
[laughter]
--
that
we
don't
need
to
decide.
