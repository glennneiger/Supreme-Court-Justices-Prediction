we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
agins
against
city
of
tiburon.
mr.
kanner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
--
you
observed
more
the
volume
of
the
briefing
than
the
controversy,
mr.
kanner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
--
there
was
a
way,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
a
way,
wasn't
there,
the
administrative
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unusable
for
any
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can't
you
build
one
house
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
the
zoning
traditionally,
impair
a
value
of
property
for
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
owners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
telling
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
court
now
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
there
was
anything
to
prevent
you
from
making
an
application
to
build
five
houses,
one
on
each
acre?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
--
how
do
you
know,
unless
you
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
kanner,
that
your
friends
on
the
other
side
had
come
in,
in
their
brief
and
tendered
on
behalf
of
the
city,
assurance
that
you
could
build
one
house
on
each
of
the
5
acres
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
you
still
be
here
making
these
arguments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
one
house
for
the
entire
5
acres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
--
but
you're
never
applying
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
never
sought
to
get
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kanner.
mr.
shute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
mr.
kanner's
suggestion
that
an
application
to
build
five
houses,
one
per
acre,
would've
been
utterly
futile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
master
plan
for
how
many
units?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
for
the
5
acres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
what
period
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
--
is
that
issue
somewhat
moved
from
the
case,
by
your
friend's
concession,
which
at
least
i
understood
him
to
make
that
he
understands,
he
can
build
one
house
on
the
5
acres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
he
--
his
response
was
that
he
knows.
he
could
build
one
house
on
the
5
acres,
but
he
has
never
tried
to
--
the
--
the
one
house
for
one
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
kanner,
a
while
ago
--
mr.
justice
white,
put
a
question
to
your
friend
and
summarized
what
the
highest
court
of
california
has
said
namely
that
is
--
is
clear
said
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
they
can
build
from
one
to
five
houses
on
this
property.
i
believe
mr.
kanner
agreed
that
that's
what
the
court
had
held
do
--
if
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
california
law,
if
--
if
there
had
been
no
appeal
taken
here,
could
the
--
the
owners
have
applied
them
for
five
buildings
on
the
5
acres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
the
decision
was
thought
to
be
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
it
was
done
for
subsurface
purpose
of
keeping
this
property
completely
open,
destroying
its
value
as
he
said,
would
that
be
within
the
reach
of
litigation
in
california
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
i
read
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion
again,
the
very
point
that
mr.
justice
white
called
attention
to
before.
they
review
the
statements
of
the
appellant
here
as
claiming
it
deprived
of
the
land
over
--
landowner
of
all
reasonable
use
of
his
property
and
then
the
court
said
this,
“the
ordinance
before
us
had
no
such
effect.”
according
to
the
wording
of
the
ordinance,
the
zoning
allows
plaintiffs
to
build
between
one
and
five
residences
on
their
property.
so,
the
perspective
purchaser
would
know
that
he
could
build
one
for
the
supreme
court
of
california
having
said
so
and
that
it
has
an
administrative
process
for
a
modification
of
the
zoning
would
possibly
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so
what
they
are
expected
to
do
is
apply
for
the
five
before
the
complaint,
is
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kanner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
perhaps
because
of
the
way
you
undertook
to
set
this
litigation
in
motion,
instead
of
asking
for
what
is
provided
under
california
--
under
the
city's
ordinance,
an
opportunity
to
get
five
sites
and
you
passed
that
opportunity
and
plunged
right
in
to
the
total
litigation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
you
can
still
apply
if
--
if
we
affirmed
here
hypothetically,
that
you
can
go
back
and
apply
for
five
sites?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
carrey
against
