mr.
kanner,
maybe
i'm
missing
something
here,
but
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
first
cause
of
action
was
action
for
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
held,
there
is
no
such
remedy
as
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
didn't
grant
you
leave
to
amend.
then
your
second
action
is
one
where
you
attacked
the
bloody
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
validity
of
the
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
where
in
this
--
and
you
were
given
leave
to
amend,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
but
you
declined?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
allegation
in
the
second
cause
of
action
do
you
principally
rely
on
as
indicating
that
you
could
prove
that
you
can
even
build
five
houses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
one
here
could
allege
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
you
concede
you
could
build
five
houses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
haven't
alleged
you
couldn't,
i
don't
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
never
pleaded
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
say
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
california
law
they
would
not
allow
you
to
plead
that
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shute,
i
wonder
if
you'd
comment
on
mr.
kanner's
reference
to
subparagraph
(e)
on
--
on
page
32
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“permanents
of
open
space
that
the
part
about
land
to
be
preserved
as
open
space
shall
be
maintained
as
permanent
open
space
by
dedication
of
the
city
of
fee
title
or
scenic
easements
and
the
like.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shute,
just
to
get
one
thing
in
--
through
my
head.
is
it
correct
that
the
only
action
that
the
city
has
taken
with
respect
to
the
--
the
appellant's
property
is
that
they
passed
this
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
--
that's
all
over.
that's
--
that's
something
that
--
that's
aborted
completely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
only
legal
--
only
--
only
significant,
only
step
that
has
any
legal
effect
that's
outstanding
now
on
their
property
is
the
ordinance
itself
and
so
the
question
really
is
whether
the
ordinance
on
its
face,
constitutes
a
taking,
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
the
supreme
court
said,
“if
you
read
the
ordinance
the
way
we
read
it,”
the
california
supreme
court,
they're
still
free
to
build
some
houses
if
they
file
appropriate
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there'd
been
something
like
29
or
30
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
how
many
of
them
do
you
think,
i
have
to
read
to
understand
the
issue?
[laughter]
