justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kanner,
let
me
ask
you
a
--
a
question
about
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case,
because
of
my
lack
of
familiarity
with
california
law.
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
your
clients
brought
an
action
in
the
superior
court
of
marin
county
and
a
demurrer
one
--
a
demurrer
to
one
count
was
sustained
and
demurrers
to
another
was
overruled.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
live
with
--
with
leave.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
well,
what
i'm
puzzled
about
is,
do
we
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
ultimately,
your
client
would
be
allowed
to
build
one
house
per
acre
on
this
5-acre
tract
or
only
one
house
on
the
entire
5-acre
tract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
city
of
tiburon
have
a
zoning
commission,
before
whom
you
could've
gone
and
asked
leave
to
build
one
house
per
acre?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
don't
know
what
this
point
then,
whether
if
you
had
followed
some
sort
of
zoning
board
or
adjustment
board
procedure,
you
might
or
might
not
have
been
allowed
to
build
one
house
per
acre?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
is
almost
then
as
if,
the
legislature
had
said,
“you're
5-acre
is
zoned
as
a
park
and
nothing
--
nothing
should
be
built
on
it.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
me,
an
illegal
sense
in
which
--
which
your
theory
or
complaint
boils
down
to
is
it,
on
the
allegations
in
your
complaint,
instead
of
having
the
demurrer
sustained,
it
should
have
been
overruled
and
a
trial
on
the
facts
should
have
been
held.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kanner,
supposing
that
this
court
were
to
hold
that
california
under
our
--
the
federal
constitution
has
the
perfect
right
to
withhold
the
remedy
of
inverse
condemnation,
so
has
it
grant
you
the
right
to
establish
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
particular
ordinance.
nonetheless,
you
would
have
to
prove
a
taking,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
--
where
in
--
in
the
record,
may
i
ask,
or
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
or
appendix,
is
your
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
color
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
was
reimbursed
for
his
expenses
and
then
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
--
mr.
shute,
let
--
let
me
refer
to
you
to
part
of
a
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
allegation
is
that
the
--
number
seven
that
the
ordinance
and
question
is
arbitrary,
capricious
and
reasonable
and
therefore,
constituted
so
taking
their
property
without
payment
of
just
compensation
violation
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
in
prohibiting
such.
now,
as
i
say,
i'm
--
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
california
rules
presently
but
i
--
i
would've
thought
that
in
--
under
ordinary
rules,
a
notice
pleading
in
allegation
such
as
that,
the
sustaining
of
a
demurrer
to
what
have
said
the
--
the
--
even
if
the
ordinance
does
that,
it's
perfectly
all
right,
which
strikes
me
as
a
somewhat
odd
results.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
the
city
in
this
response,
make
any
defense
that
you
haven't
even
taken
this
before
the
zoning
board
or
the
land
development
board,
whatever
you
have.
rather
than
--
it's
simply
demurring
which
is
as
i
understand,
the
same
as
saying
a
motion
the
--
if
complaint
fails
to
state
a
claim
and
which
relief
maybe
--
maybe
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
it
up
--
is
--
is
it
your
contention
that
it
was
--
the
demurrer
was
sustained
because
of
that
reason
or
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
upheld
the
superior
court's
ruling
because
of
that
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
city
could've
waited
five
or
10
years
for
them
to
get
a
master
plan
approved
and
meanwhile,
these
owners
could
have
been
a
kind
of
held
in
suspense
until
the
master
plan
was
finally
approved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
owner
can
simply
submit
a
master
plan
for
his
5
acres
to
the
zoning
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
--
if
they
allege
--
if
the
owner
alleges
that
it
has
been
taken,
a
--
a
demurrer
is
not
a
satisfactory
responsive,
it
seemed
to
me.
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
have
to
come
in
and
--
and
deny
that
it
is
been
taken
and
that
is
a
state's
factual
proof.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
was
five
houses
on
the
5
acres?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
--
you
say,
basically
the
validity
of
the
supreme
court
of
california's
judgment
can
be
sustained
on
the
exhaustion
of
i'd
mean,
the
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
regardless
of
whether
or
not,
the
complaint
should've
--
could've
been
demurred
to
on
the
merits
so
to
speaks,
saying
there
was
no
taking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
ordinance
passed
before
or
after
the
appellants
acquired
their
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
would've
automatically
entitled
them
to
build
one
house
per
acre
or
five
houses
on
these
5-acres?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
--
does
that
mean
that
any
claim
--
any
cause
of
action
for
monitory
damages
is
suspect,
because
it
has
a,
“chilling
effect”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
state
actions
in
effect,
are
regulatory
actions,
aren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
--
did
the
court
say
that
in
--
that
that
was
what
troubled
me.
did
the
court
say
that
in
so
many
words,
i
have
the
same
impression
as
my
brother
stewart
that
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
this
was
a
taking
because
as
applied
to
their
land,
because
very
possibly,
they
could
only
build
one
house
and
that
--
that
was
simply
destroying
that
value
a
demurrer
was
sustained.
and
then,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said,
“well,
the
ordinance
will
allow
one
to
five
houses.”
but
it
--
it
didn't
seem
to
me
it
relied
on
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
