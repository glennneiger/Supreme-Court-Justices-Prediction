justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
california
court
of
appeals.
california
has
a
resale
price
maintenance
statute
for
wine.
under
this
statute
a
wine
producer
may
set
prices
through
a
fair
trade
contract.
if
this
is
not
done,
wholesalers
must
post
a
resale
price
schedule
for
that
producer's
brand.
wine
merchants
are
required
to
sell
to
retailers
only
at
prices
established
in
this
manner.
respondent
charged
with
violating
established
prices
successfully
challenged
the
california
system
as
violative
of
the
sherman
act.
we
granted
certiorari.
the
california
statute
was
defended
in
this
court
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
its
program
is
immune
from
federal
antirust
laws
under
the
state
action
exception,
an
exception
this
court
created
in
parker
against
brown
decided
in
1943.
secondly,
it
was
argued
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
repealed
the
prohibition
amendment
authorized
the
states
to
regulate
traffic
in
liquor.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
court's
opinion,
we
reject
both
of
these
arguments.
neither
the
state
action
doctrine
of
parker
against
brown
nor
the
twenty-first
amendment
authorizes
a
state
to
delegate
the
private
parties
the
right
to
fix
prices
in
a
manner
that
would
violate
federal
antitrust
laws.
we
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
