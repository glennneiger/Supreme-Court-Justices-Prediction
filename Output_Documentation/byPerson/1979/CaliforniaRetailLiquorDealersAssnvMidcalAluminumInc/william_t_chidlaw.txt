mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
we
have
before
us
now
involves
the
state's
power
to
regulate
liquor
within
a
state's
borders
as
opposed
to
the
commerce
clause
and
specifically
a
statute
enacted
under
the
commerce
clause,
namely
the
sherman
act.
in
this
particular
case,
the
city
of
california
has
an
extensive
comprehensive
alcohol
and
beverage
control
act
which
includes
within
its
provisions
two
that
are
specifically
involved
in
this
case
dealing
with
wine.
and
those
two
sections
require
that
the
price
at
which
wine
will
be
sold
from
wholesale
to
retail
be
posted
with
the
department
and
the
other
section
requires
that
the
wine
we
sold
at
a
price
no
lower
than
that
price
typically.
the
case
involves
the
setting
of
that
--
of
those
prices
specifically
this
case
involves
wholesale
to
retail,
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
statute
involves
that
both
that
wholesale
to
retail
price
and
the
retail
to
consumer
price
for
wine
in
california
be
set
generally
by
the
wine
producer,
that
is
a
third
party.
the
problem
that
we
have
and
the
reason
we're
here
today
is
because
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
case
that
was
decided
approximately
year
before
the
instant
case
ruled
that
the
requirement
that
the
manufactures
of
distilled
sprits
set
the
price
from
retailer
to
consumer
was
invalid
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
sherman
act.
and
in
this
case,
our
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
bound
to
follow
that
california
supreme
court
case
and
apply
it
not
only
at
the
retail
to
consumer
for
wine
level
but
also
at
the
wholesale
to
retail
level.
in
other
words,
extending
that
case
somewhat
on
the
basis
primarily
that
the
--
there
was
no
difference
in
our
court
of
appeals'
mind
between
a
manufacturer
setting
the
price
from
retail
to
consumer
and
a
manufacture
setting
the
price
from
wholesale
to
retail.
we
think
there
are
some
difference
between
that
(inaudible)
basis
and
purpose
of
the
statutes.
however,
i
think
and
those
are
covered
in
our
brief.
so
i
don't
think
that
in
view
of
the
situation
and
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
that
that
necessarily
needs
to
be
discussed
at
oral
argument.
the
court
of
appeal
declared
both
those
statutes
to
be
invalid
following
the
rice
case.
now
the
rice
case
by
our
california
supreme
court
evolved
--
the
court
evolved
a
new
test.
we
find
this
test
in
no
other
cases
either
in
california
or
in
the
--
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
and
what
the
court
did
in
that
case,
the
california
supreme
court
did
was
to
take
various
cases
by
this
court
in
which
state
regulation
of
liquor
had
been
involved
but
which
had
involved
provisions
of
the
constitution
other
than
the
commerce
clause
for
instance,
the
first
amendment
like
in
larue
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
like
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
which
was
a
due
process
case.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
no,
it
was
not.
there
was
no
writ
filed
in
the
rice
case
and
the
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
i
would
think
that
if
we
prevail
here
that
this
court
in
order
to
eliminate
the
uncertainty
and
confusion
caused
by
that
case
will
overrule
the
rice
case.
we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
case
that's
specifically
before
you,
but
to
overrule
rice
case
and
eliminate
its
effect.
we
have
not
briefed
but
there
was
a
case
pending
for
the
court
of
appeal
in
new
york
today
which
was
argued
a
week
ago,
monday
which
involves
the
fair
trade
wine
retail
to
consumer
in
new
york.
the
castlewood
case
implications
in
that
case
which
was
a
case
in
which
the
federal
regulations
under
the
--
from
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
ran
and
hit
on
into
a
state
statute
from
florida
that
in
which
there
was
a
conflict
about
what
discounts
were
proper.
that
case
is
i
understand
the
time
for
filing
with
this
court
is
not
yet
expired
and
there's
a
suggestion
in
the
footnote
from
respondent
midcal
that
that
case
maybe
on
its
way
here.
kansas
just
past
session
enacted
a
new
regulatory
scheme
for
alcoholic
beverages
where
they
abandoned
the
idea
that
administratively
they
would
set
the
prices
for
liquor
in
kansas
and
instead
adopted
minimum
markup
statute
where
in
effect
the
outsider,
the
private,
the
third
party
or
whoever
sets
the
price
or
the
cost
and
then
state
simply
says
what
percentage
the
retailer
will
add
to
that
price.
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
kansas
law
that
also
would
be
i
think
deemed
to
involve
anti-competitive
situation.
so,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
around
the
country
that
are
involved
in
the
same
basic
problem
that
the
rice
case
has
created,
this
balancing
of
the
interest
test.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
i
would
presume,
i
think
your
point
is
well
taken
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
presume
that
if
and
when
this
court
rules
that
our
position
on
the
relative
importance
of
the
two
constitutional
provisions,
they
were
correct
on
that
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
follow
the
decision
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
this
court
can
avoid
ruling
on
the
question
that
was
the
basis
of
the
rice
case.
so,
and
i
would
presume
that
our
california
supreme
court
would
follow
this
court's
decisions.
so,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
idle
act
on
those
matters
and
on
the
specific
case,
i
don't
think
there's
--
there
would
be
any
--
any
problem
at
all.
i
think
that
we've
covered
in
our
briefs,
this
court
has
explored
this
--
the
difference
between
a
state
statute
that's
regulating
liquor
when
it
conflicts
with
the
commerce
clause
and
always
upheld
that
and
discussed,
this
court
has
discussed
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
equal
protection
exceptions
to
that.
this
court
discussed
over
and
over
again
the
federal
enclave
exception
where
the
goods
are
intended
for
federal
law
enclave
and
foreign
commerce
like
in
the
hostetter
versus
idlewild.
so,
i
think
that
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
balancing
of
interest
test
that
was
evolved
by
the
california
supreme
court
is
simply
based
on
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
those
exception
cases
that
did
not
involve
the
commerce
clause
running
here
on
and
to
regulation
of
liquor
within
a
state.
now,
it's
been
suggested
by
both
midcal
and
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
that
if
we
give
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
which
i
believe
this
court
is
always
given
it
as
far
as
the
state's
power
is
concerned,
that
allows
the
state
to
in
the
name
of
regulating
liquor
to
regulate
the
hours
of
employment
and
securities
requirements
and
they've
conjured
up
a
situation
which
would
involve
all
kinds
of
conflicts
with
other
federal
laws
and
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
contention
is
that
the
state
has
to
be
regulating
liquor.
if
the
state
is
trying
to
regulate
securities
in
the
name
of
liquor
or
the
wages
and
hours
in
name
of
liquor
or
even
freedom
of
speech
for
instance
like
in
larue
where
there
was
no
--
if
there
is
no
connection
with
regulating
liquor,
i
think
that
in
those
cases
clearly
the
state
has
the
power.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
i
can't
conceive
of
any
legitimate
state
purpose
in
regulating
liquor
that
would
also
deal
with
the
regulating
of
the
wages
for
a
driver
of
truck
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
in
this
--
in
the
wholesale
to
retail,
the
state
interest
isn't
preventing
discrimination
among
similarly
situated
retailers
for
instance.
we
have
this
price
posted,
everyone
knows
what
that
price
is
and
they
are
required
to
sell
at
that
price
so
there
can't
be
any
discrimination
among
retailers
by
the
wholesalers.
in
robinson-patman
type
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
i
can't
conceive
of
any
legitimate
state
purpose
in
doing
that
because
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
designed
in
my
opinion,
and
i
think
the
cases
support
this,
to
allow
state
to
regulate
liquor
within
its
borders.
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
i
--
that's
--
i
think
there
are
justifications
for
the
statute
here
that
historic,
traditional
and
do
have
a
relation
to
regulating
liquor
and
i
don't
see
any
justification
for
regulating
in
these
other
areas
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
there
are,
there's
an
unfair
practices
act
that
prohibits
that.
there
--
our
california
supreme
court
has
observed
however
there's
a
very
difficult
to
prove
violations
of
that
and
therefore,
our
california
supreme
court
in
past
has
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
act
is
to
make
proof
easy
in
these
type
of
situations.
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
using
words
like
“picking
up”
words,
this
court
used
like
“pro
tanto
repeal”
and
each
considered
in
the
light
of
the
other
referring
to
constitutional
provisions.
i
think
they've
gotten
off
the
track
and
the
regard
and
i
think
the
important
phrase
is
to
look
at
when
you're
examining
the
state
statute
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
are
phrases
that
have
been
used
by
this
court
like
unfettered
by
the
commerce
clause.
and
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
is
the
one
that
said
the
rules
of
the
state
and
federal
government
were
reversed
in
the
field
of
liquor
regulation
as
far
as
the
commerce
clause
was
concerned.
this
court
has
said
has
recently
as
larue
that
the
states
are
totally
unconfined
by
traditional
commerce
clause
limitations.
i'd
like
to
go
from
those
remarks
into
what
is
now
have
been
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
idea
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
because
of
the
language
used
and
because
of
some
quotations
from
some
of
legislative
history
simply
allows
a
state
to
either
prohibit
or
restrict
imports.
and
i
think
jumping
ahead,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
contention
is
that
this
court
has
never
so
held
but
more
importantly
is
if
that
were
the
only
thing
that
twenty-first
amendment
did
if
that
was
the
only
power
that
that
gave
to
the
states
then
the
state's
--
that
would
constitute
a
freezing
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
concept
in
1933.
in
other
words,
in
1933,
the
commerce
clause
had
not
been
ruled
by
this
court
to
extend
the
far
reaches
that
it
has
today
and
at
that
time
when
they
were
discussing
the
twenty-first
amendment
everyone
knew
that
the
state
had
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
generally
once
it
had
gotten
beyond
this
interstate
commerce
as
interpreted
then,
that
concept.
so
therefore
to
have
specified
specifically
that
a
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
liquor
within
its
borders
and
say
it
in
more
specific
language
than
they
had
would
have
been
suffrage.
if
we
were
to
go
back
to
the
sherman
act
in
1890,
as
one
of
--
as
one
of
the
justices
and
i
--
forgive
me
i
don't
remember
which
one
but
in
a
--
either
concurring
opinion
or
dissent
pointed
out
that
in
1890
when
the
sherman
act
was
being
debated
there
was
a
lot
of
languages
on
the
floor
of
congress
indicating
the
sherman
act
was
not
intended
to
extend
into
the
states'
borders
and
indeed
it
didn't
until
the
30's
--
middle
30's.
so,
what
counsel
is
contending
for
with
this
argument
about
in
fact
wet
dry,
the
state
simply
has
a
right
to
remain
dry
and
to
prohibit
the
imports
is
to
freeze
the
twenty-first
amendment
effect
and
allow
the
commerce
clause
effect
to
go
right
on
up-to-date
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
as
i
think
i
have
in
the
brief
that
unfettered
by
the
commerce
clause
means
unfettered
by
the
commerce
clause
as
it
exists
today
not
as
it
existed
in
1933.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
are
we
talking
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
that
one
troubles
me
just
a
little
bit
but
this
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
my
answer
to
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
my
answer
to
you
specific
would
be
yes,
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
power
to
do
that,
but
i
would
follow
that
up
with
the
idea
that
no
state
has
ever
done
that
to
my
knowledge.
no
state
has
ever
authorized
horizontal
price
fixing.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
i
think
i
did
in
the
parker
case.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
that's
correct
and
i
do
believe
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
the
state
does
have
the
power
to
do
that.
i
think
that
they
would
state
because
of
the
combination
of
our
state
to
manufacturers
and
instate
manufacturers
a
state
might
well
has
some
extra
territorial
effects
in
such
a
statute.
and
there
might
be
other
reasons
the
equal
protection
consideration
would
come
into
play
and
i
think
that
although
the
state
would
have
the
basic
power
in
some
cases
to
do
that,
i
think
there
be
some
problems
with
it
in
connection
with
these
other
areas.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
yes,
it
certainly
were.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
no,
i
think
that's
true
and
that's
would
happens
in
the
monopoly
state.
the
state
has
the
total
monopoly
and
it
sets
one
price,
it's
as
though
all
the
competitors
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
i
suppose
the
hesitation
is
based
on
the
idea
that
i
don't
believe
any
legislature
has
ever
done
that
i
am
not
anticipating
a
legislature
would
do
that
because
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
yes,
absolutely
i
agree
that
the
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
the
state
the
power
to
do
that
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
right,
and
whether
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
right,
i
suppose
what
i'm
doing
is
putting
myself
in
the
position
of
legislate
and
i
might
have
some
personal
reservations
about
doing
that
but
yes
the
state
has
that
power.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
i
think
again
--
i
think
we
run
into
an
equal
protection
argument
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
that's
the
absolute
theory.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
well,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
held
by
this
court
and
i
think
rightly
so
to
effect
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
only
intended
to
do
replace
the
commerce
clause
and
liquor
regulation.
it
wasn't
intended
to
replace
the
equal
protection
clause,
or
the
due
process
clause
or
any
of
the
other
personal
guarantees
and
i
don't
believe
the
juror
scheme
would
hold
up
under
an
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
not
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
no,
no
i
wouldn't
because
and
i
want
to
be
very
careful
by
how
i
say
this
but
the
schwegmann
case
did
not
involve
a
liquor
fair
trade
statute,
it
involved
the
general
fair-trade
statute
and
if
the
state
has
not
acted
in
the
liquor
field
then
the
federal
law
you
know
may
operate
and
--
mr.
william
t.
chidlaw
the
--
i
would
think
i'm
basically
out
of
time.
i
didn't
want
to
--
a
time
but
i
did
want
to
suggest
that
the
preemption
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
which
i
received
the
printed
brief
only
last
friday
and
it
was
somewhat
different
in
the
uncorrected
typescript
that
i
had
received
before
but
i
did
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
although
the
federal
trade
commission
seemingly
approved
the
uncorrected
typescript
that
i
received
a
week
before
that
in
the
printed
brief
and
i'm
not
sure
what
page
that
appears,
in
the
printed
brief
we
have
to
see
attorneys
of
--
i
don't
want
to
use
a
word
“disavowed"
but
they've
indicated
and
not
participating
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
argument.
i
think
that's
significant.
thank
you.
