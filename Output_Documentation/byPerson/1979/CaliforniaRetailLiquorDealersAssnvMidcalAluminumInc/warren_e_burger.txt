if
the
states,
taking
virginia
as
one
example,
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
it
wanted
to
discourage
the
use
of
hard
liquor
and
encourage
the
consumption
of
wines,
could
it
charge
for
example
$25
a
bottle
fixing
its
price
in
its
store
is
$25
a
bottle
for
scotch
and
bourbon
and
gin
and
you
use
the
extra
profits
to
subsidize
a
lower
price
on
wine
perhaps
selling
it
at
cost
or
below
its
cost?
