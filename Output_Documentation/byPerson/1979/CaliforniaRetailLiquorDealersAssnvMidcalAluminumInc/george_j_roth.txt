mr.
george
j.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
make
some
remarks
about
the
state
action
part
of
the
case
and
i
believe
that
the
best
way
for
all
of
us
to
look
at
it
is
in
a
schematic
way
just
first
look
at
originally
the
united
states
of
america
didn't
have
any
anti-competitive
law.
there
were
some
general
or
vague
common
law
of
principles
coming
down
from
old
english
law
and
then
the
sherman
anti-trust
act
was
passed
and
that
was
the
first
time
we
really
had
a
federal
law
relating
to
the
anti-competitive
activity.
and
then
subsequent
to
that,
we
had
miller-tydings
and
mcguire
acts
which
permitted
an
exception
to
the
sherman
act
and
permitted
any
commodity,
the
manufacture
of
any
commodity
to
determine
what
his
retail
price
for
that
product
should
be.
and
then
schematically
came
along
the
state
laws
relating
to
fair-trade
in
alcoholic
beverages
and
super
imposed
on
all
list,
was
the
parker-brown
state
action
exemption
and
i
think
to
see
how
it
all
fits
together,
we
have
to
look
at
the
differences
between
miller-tydings
type
of
fair-trade
which
i
sometimes
call
regular
fair-trade
and
state
liquor
fair-trade.
and
then
the
miller-tydings
regular
fair-trade
you
have
two
factors;
one
is
that
the
regulation
of
the
fair-trade
is
totally
optional
both
on
the
manufacturer
and
on
the
retailer.
the
manufacturer
can
say,
“i
desire
to
fair-trade
my
merchandise
or
i
do
not
do
so.”
the
retailer
i
can
say,
“i
desired
to
handle
fair-trade
merchandise
or
i
do
not
do
so.
you
do
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
he
handles
it
he
has
no
option
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
the
option
is
there
if
he
wants
to
take
it
and
in
the
state
liquor
fair-trade
on
the
other
hand
everything
is
mandatory.
the
state
liquor
fair-trade
is
highly
regulated
at
all
stages
of
the
process
from
the
manufacturing
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
but
the
industry
is
and
i
think
that
that's
very
important
that
the
industry
at
every
single
level
is
regulated.
you
can't
operate
without
a
state
license,
as
a
retailer,
you
can't
operate
as
a
wholesaler
or
distributer
or
manufacturer.
and
in
exchange
for
this
exclusive
right
to
operate,
you
have
to
conform
to
the
state
law
the
state
rules,
regulations
whenever
the
dictates
and
demands
are
as
long
as
there
is
no
fundamental
constitutional
proscription.
the
state
for
instance
can't
say
to
you
as
a
person
who
has
a
license
in
the
alcoholic
beverage
business
that
you
must
discriminate
against
certain
people
and
this
just
obvious
certain
federal
prescriptions
and
constitutional
prescriptions,
but
generally
you
have
to
conform.
it's
part
of
the
necessity
of
being
in
the
business,
sir?
mr.
george
j.
roth
let
me
put
it
this
way
your
honor.
i
talked
to
the
counsel
for
the
board
on
the
26th
of
december
and
i
said
i
may
be
asked
that
question
and
i
had
an
attorney
client
privilege
at
that
time
and
i
said,
“what
may
i
tell
the
court?”
counsel
for
the
board
said
to
me,
“you
can
tell
the
court
that
the
director
dislikes
fair-trade
immensely
but
he
did
very
much
want
to
see
the
state's
right
to
regulate
in
the
area,
protected”
and
that's
about
as
far
as
i
have
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
in
his
judgment
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
disagree
because
we
believe
it's
a
legislative
judgment
and
that
absent
a
court
decision
or
on
the
other
hand
this
court
coming
out
with
a
different
ruling
he
would
be
bound
to
fall.
mr.
george
j.
roth
sir?
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
no
this
--
the
state
itself
you
say
there
is
no
issue
here?
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
--
as
i
understand
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
not
to
set
the
price
the
point
is
that
the
state
statute
says,
“that
at
the
tail-end
of
the
state
action
exemption
in
effect
that
the
manufact
--
i'm
sorry,
the
manufacturer
is
given
the
right
to
set
the
price
that
his
merchandise
should
be
sold
for.”
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
don't
quite
follow
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
that
would
be
just
like
the
old
fair-trade
act
but
that
would
be
different
i
think.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
i
would
make
the
argument
because
here
we
have
the
state
statutes
specifically
saying
(voice
overlap)
i
have
to
do
that.
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
the
legislative
passed
then
i
think
it
comes
under
the
state
exception
yes
your
honor.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exception
arises
because
the
state
specifically
tells
the
licensee
what
the
conduct
is.
this
is
not
the
fact
that
the
tail-end
he
has
this
right
to
set
that
price.
it's
the
fact
that
he
is
told
as
a
licensee
in
the
liquor
business
you
must
do
this
and
the
legislature
has
come
along
and
determined
that
it
was
necessary
for
certain
reasons.
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“there's
a
difference
of
opinion
on
it.”
we
think
the
weight
now
is
the
other
way
the
public
policies
the
other
way.
they
never
specifically
said
it
was
totally
the
other
way
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
only
under
the
parker
versus
rice
case
where
the
state
told
them
to.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
i
would
say
not
that's
a
matter
for
the
federal
government
of
the
state
government
to
go
in
and
say,
“wait
a
minute,
the
state
law
doesn't
let
you
do
that,
you
can't
go
and
have
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
roth
the
california
cartwright
act
certainly
does
and
the
federal
sherman
act
certainly
does.
it
prohibits
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir,
because
the
state
law
does
not
permit
that.
the
state
law
says,
“the
individual
brand
owner
sets
his
own
price.”
it
doesn't
say
you
can
conspire
with
other
people
to
set
a
price?
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
but
if
you
had
the
--
it
would
violate
(voice
overlap)
with
one
time
the
state
did.
mr.
george
j.
roth
the
state
has
set
a
price
on
milk
and
it
just
that
the
state
recently
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
the
state
milk
is
not
high
--
as
highly
regulated
as
the
liquor
industry.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
here
you
have
a
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
think
that
state
exemption
argument
comes
into
it
your
honor
in
that
--
when
you
have
the
total
regulation
and
the
state
saying,
“we
regulate,
we
say
this
and
we
police
this
as
they
do
here
just
because
they
had
an
accusation
(voice
overlap)
against
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
well,
i
follow
your
honor's
argument
but
i
think
if
the
state
wanted
to
that
the
state
could
set
milk
prices.
and
they
could
tell
the
producer
just
as
here
at
the
end
of
the
line
you
set
the
price
that
which
you
have
to
pay.
it's
the
same
thing
but
here
i
think
it's
different
because
you'll
have
our
case
you
have
a
statute
that
requires
and
you
have
a
highly
regulated
industry,
it's
been
regulated
since
the
beginning
of
time
the
liquor
industry
ever
since
prohibition
was
came
back
if
ever
since
repeal
you
have
it.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
it
would
not.
mr.
george
j.
roth
he
would
not
he
would
have
to
say
the
price
from
my
merchandise
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
$4
a
bottle
period
and
that's
the
limit.
if
he
did
something
like
that
i
think
that
he'd
be
violating
the
sherman
act
or
the
state
cartwright
act.
mr.
george
j.
roth
he
can
but
it
--
that's
true
in
any
business
today.
mr.
george
j.
roth
and
if
the
(voice
overlap)
department
here
is
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
feel
very
certain
that
the
state
government
at
least
and
i'm
sure
that
the
federal
government
would
come
in
and
they
try
to
put
those
people
in
jail
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
the
way
it's
written,
no
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i'm
positive
that's
--
by
the
way
i
read
the
law,
it
says,
“the
individual
shall
set
that
price.”
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
justice
stewart?
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
they
can
prosecute
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
they
can
prosecute
your
honor
in
an
area
that's
not
subject
to
the
state
regulation
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
at
least
concurrent
here
we
under
your
question
as
i
understand
it
the
anti-competitive
activity
which
is
--
would
be

he's
not
yet
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
not
authorized
would
be
subject
to
federal
prosecution
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
i
see
it
the
twenty-first
amendment
within
the
area
of
the
state
regulation
inside
the
state
goes
as
far
as
to
say
that
if
the
state
passes
a
law
that
says
a
certain
act
shall
occur
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
that
conflicts
with
the
sherman
anti-trust
act.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
this
sense
your
honor
that
there's
an
argument
that
only
means
wet-dry
and
over
here
there's
an
argument
that
it
means
something
more
than
wet-dry.
and
if
it
means
something
more
than
that
it
means
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
preempt
the
federal
government
in
that
area
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
until
it
does
preempt
this
concurrence
jurisdiction
justice.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes.
mr.
george
j.
roth
right.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
i
think
that
when
you
get
into
an
area
where
the
individual
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
if
you
can
prove
that
he
is
attempting
to
go
and
go
further
just
to
set
his
price
not
the
set
a
price
but
to
prove
some
ulterior
motive
on
his
part
with
a
combination
of
some
way
or
another
to
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
you
will
have
the
problem
in
california
at
least
that
there's
a
cost
relationship
there,
and
he
has
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
right.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
i
think
then
he
individually
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
meant,
i
agree
with
you
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
if
the
state
--
let
me
try
at
this
way,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
action
doctrine
would
simply
permit
a
state
to
ban
importation,
the
simple
act
of
banning
importation
in
order
to
cartelize
its
domestic
industry.
i
don't
think
the
state
action
doctrine
carries
that
far.
that's
not
--
that
is
commanding
what
the
sherman
act
forbids.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
it
may.
if
i
understand
the
(voice

--
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
that
there
are
areas
where
the
conflict
with
the
sherman
act
may
not
be
as
direct
as
it
is
here
where
the
twenty-first
amendment
might
give
the
states
greater
degree
of
authority
than
the
state
action
doctrine.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
correct.
i
think
what
the
state
can
do
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
based
on
the
decisions
you
cited
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
is
block
all
importation
--
