justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chidlaw,
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
you
said
you
felt
we
should
overrule
the
rice
case
which
is
i
understand
is
a
california
case.
i
reminded
of
what
i
think
is
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
all
this
court
can
do
in
its
order
if
it
reverses
a
state
supreme
court
or
state
appellate
court
as
to
say,
it's
reversed
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
couldn't
cast
doubt
on
the
rice
case,
but
surely
we
couldn't
say
in
the
opinion
that
the
rice
case
is
overruled
that
--
that's
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
were
certainly
extra
territorial
effects
in
parker
against
brown
too
where
the
resin
crop
was
shipped
out
of
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
owens,
if
in
the
absence
of
statute,
do
you
think
a
posting
practice
engaged
in
by
sellers
would
be
violative
of
any
of
the
anti-trust
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
if
there
--
you
say
there's
a
risk
of
an
anti-trust
violation
in
a
posting
statute
or
a
posting
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
we
made
that
self
examination
parker
against
brown
if
the
california
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
price
of
the
resin
market
nonetheless
it
could've
done
it
in
a
different
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that
it
turns
on
that?
i
thought
it
turned
on
the
fact
that
it
was
the
state
that
it
mandated
the
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
virginia
state
liquor
stores
were
you
go
in
the
state
liquor
store
and
you
can
buy
a
particular
brand
only
at
a
particular
price
and
only
the
state
sells
liquor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
any
better
than
what
california
has?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
owens,
you
would
concede
i
take
it
in
your
reference
to
burke
against
ford
that
in
an
unargued
percuriam
decision
of
this
court
it's
two
pages
long
doesn't
have
the
same
precedential
way,
there's
an
orally
argument
argued
case
followed
by
our
written
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
if
the
legislature
is
responsive
to
interest
in
the
state
the
same
way
other
supervisory
boards
would
be
and
if
it
declares
a
flat
ban
or
a
flat
approval
that
is
as
much
state
action
as
a
legislative
authorization
to
some
subordinate
of
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
make
sense
to
you
logically?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
sherman
act
is
somehow
more
important
than
say
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
any
clean
error
act
or
any
number
of
other
acts
enacted
by
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
important
bodies
of
federal
law
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
are
we
to
judge?
if
congress
has
an
access
a
hundred
statutes
and
each
contains
flat
prohibitory
language,
which
ones
are
important
and
which
one
aren't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
all
these
hundred
is
very
clear
and
it
prohibits?
