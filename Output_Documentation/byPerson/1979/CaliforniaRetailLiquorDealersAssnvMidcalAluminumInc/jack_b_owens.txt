mr.
jack
b.
owens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
midcal
would
like
to
commence
with
the
brief
description
of
the
statute
the
court
which
i
think
is
required
in
response
to
an
argument
made
by
the
petitioner.
in
order
to
decide
this
case
correctly,
it's
important
to
understand
that
this
is
a
maintenance
statute,
a
vertical
price
maintenance
statute.
you
heard
the
petitioner
argue
that
one
of
the
state's
interests
behind
this
statute
was
to
prevent
price
discrimination
at
the
hands
of
wholesalers
against
retailers
and
raised
the
concept
of
posting.
i
want
to
try
to
get
across
if
i
can
the
difference
between
posting
and
price
maintenance
and
make
it
as
clear
as
i
can
that
the
statute
we
have
here
is
a
price
maintenance
statute
and
not
a
posting
statute.
in
the
cert
petition
here
the
assertion
was
made
that
an
affirmance
in
this
case
would
continue
the
effect
of
invalidating
a
lot
of
state
statutes
around
the
country
dealing
with
posting.
that
isn't
correct.
posting
is
a
phenomenon
undertaken
in
some
state
liquor
codes
by
which
a
wholesaler
for
example
is
required
to
post
its
own
price,
that's
it.
there
is
no
control
over
that
entity's
price
by
someone
further
up
in
the
vertical
chain.
posting
is
a
simply
a
price
publication
situation
by
the
entity
that
sets
the
price.
the
bulk
of
the
statutes
that
are
cited
to
you
in
the
petition
in
the
chain
of
horribles
argument
which
is
given
there
are
posting
statutes.
what
we
have
here
is
a
maintenance
statute
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
it's
possible
under
the
container
case
and
possibly
the
egyptian
case.
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
act
of
posting
occurred
in
the
right
economic
structure
of
the
market
if
it
were
concentrated
market
and
it
led
to
horizontal
exchange
of
price
data
there
would
be
a
question
posed.
the
question
posed
in
an
earlier
era
in
the
seagram's
case
and
addressed
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
his
opinion
there,
yes,
there
is
a
risk
of
an
anti-trust
violation
in
a
posting
statute.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
both,
if
the
posting
statute
is
simply
the
requirement
to
post
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
across
now
is
that
that's
not
this
case.
that's
considerably
different
from
this
case.
this
case
and
if
you
would
envision
a
four
level
industry
producers,
wholesalers,
distributors
and
consumers,
what
we
have
here
is
the
producers
setting
the
price
for
the
wholesalers
and
the
retailers.
it's
a
maintenance
case,
it's
not
a
posting
case.
and
if
to
give
petitioner
the
point,
if
the
state
has
an
interest
in
preserving
or
preventing
price
discrimination,
this
is
not
the
way
to
do
it.
this
is
not
the
system
to
accomplish
it.
it
can
be
accomplished
if
it's
something
important
to
accomplish
about
part
from
the
standard
requirements
of
federal
anti-trust
law
or
state
anti-trust
law
for
the
system
which
is
far
less
abusive
of
federal
anti-trust
interests.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
--
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
believe
that
parker
turns
on
several
important
features
which
are
not
here
and
which
maybe
determinative.
they
are
for
example
the
fact
that
the
state
commission
in
the
parker
case
was
mandated
by
the
state
legislature
to
determine
whether
the
profits
provided
to
the
producers
as
a
result
of
program
were
unreasonable,
and
further
to
review
and
measure
the
reason
was
to
the
programs
which
were
entered
into.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no
sir
i
don't
think
so
because
the
opinion
for
the
court
indicates
quite
clearly
that
a
state
may
not
simply
command
what
the
sherman
act
forbids.
with
that
statement
in
the
opinion,
the
holding
must
be
that
what
validated
that
particular
program
was
the
degree
of
state
supervision
and
control.
and
particularly
i
would
stress
the
state's
control
over
the
profits
received
by
the
producers
because
what
you
have
there
and
this
is
consistent
with
a
lot
of
mr.
justice
blackmun's
writing
in
his
opinion
necessary.
what
you
have
there
is
the
state
creating
a
surrogate
for
the
federal
interest
espoused
in
the
sherman
act.
you
have
a
state
measuring
the
degree
of
profitability
to
the
producers
that
comes
out
of
such
a
program.
that's
totally
absent
in
this
system
and
i
think
the
absence
may
will
be
determinative.
in
any
event
what
we
have
here
is
a
maintenance
statute.
the
petitioner
continually
uses
the
phrase
are
comprehensive
scheme
extensive
regulation
scheme.
the
point
is
as
indicated
by
mr.
justice
white
there
is
no
control
by
the
state
over
these
prices
whatsoever.
the
fact
that
there
is
regulation
in
other
areas
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue
which
is
before
us
which
is
can
a
state
simply
command
what
the
sherman
forbids
which
i
believe
the
court
has
declared
twice
is
not
the
law,
parker
and
schwegmann.
on
the
question
of
the
other
states
if
i
can
close
up
that
point,
i
don't
think
it's
determinative
what
the
effect
of
this
maybe
on
other
states.
the
law
is
the
law.
you
will
decide
as
you
see
it
correctly
and
the
consequences
in
other
states
will
not
curb
your
judgment
i
suspect,
but
i
think
we
have
clear
up
the
misconception.
the
only
state
in
the
country
that
has
anything
like
the
california
system
is
new
york.
there
are
three
other
states
that
have
something
like
this,
but
the
distinction
maybe
very
important.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir,
it's
not
respondent's
position
that
state
monopolization
of
the
business
is
invalid.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
think
your
honor
that
we
can
proceed
in
greater
degree
of
confidence
that
if
the
state
takes
over
the
business
that
some
of
the
interest
which
are
--
which
underlies
the
sherman
act
will
be
served
by
the
state
itself.
it
is
the
state
running
the
program.
what
we
have
here
is
the
solicitor
general
indicated
a
bare
grant
of
permission
to
engage
in
private
price
fixing.
that
to
me
is
the
view
of
the
respondent
that
it
is
quite
a
distance
away
from
what
was
at
issue
in
between
--
the
evolution
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
in
the
state
monopoly
case
and
in
the
state
monopoly
situations
you
commonly
are
dealing
with
states
that
have
had
a
drier
philosophy
than
other
states.
you
have
activity
which
is
closer
to
what
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
designed
to
deal
with.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
as
a
matter
of
personal
preference
i
would
hope
they
didn't
attach
that
price
bourbon
but
--
yes
sir
i
believe
they
can.
yes
i
think
that
if
were
the
state
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes,
that
is
also
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes.
there
--
i
will
put
you
one
case
that
maybe
difficult
to
deal
with
there,
if
the
state
is
acting
as
the
marketer
and
also
permits
independent
retail
stores
as
i
believe
shall
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes,
and
the
state
monopoly
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
in
my
view,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes.
you
understand
i'm
giving
back
to
you
this
court's
rulings
in
the
brandeis-four
in
the
line
of
decision
--
that
you
cited.
i
will
suggest
to
you
that
what
has
happened
is
that
in
the
subsequent
cases
the
absolutist
character
of
the
brandeis-four
decisions
has
been
restricted
to
the
importation
situation.
i
think
that's
the
correct
reading
of
your
cases
over
the
last
50
years.
petitioner
constantly
cites
the
language
from
ziffrin
unfettered
by
the
commerce
clause
leaving
out
the
keywords
as
the
products
from
without
to
the
extent
that
the
brandeis-four
decisions
create
an
absolute
test.
they
do
so
in
the
importation
category.
i
would
further
argue
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
implication
of
closer
attention
to
the
history
of
the
amendment
and
the
implication
of
some
of
the
midcourse
correction
that
appears
in
your
decisions
maybe
that
at
some
point
down
the
line
the
absolute
character
of
the
brandeis-four
decisions
maybe
open
to
question,
but
we
don't
question
it
here.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir
and
i
think
you
can
go
down
the
line
on
these
cases
and
find
one
factual
distinction
or
another
but
if
i'm
reading
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
think
that's
absolutely
right
and
certainly
i
can
debate
with
the
author
of
the
idlewild
and
seagram
decisions,
but
i
believe
that
what
is
happened
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir.
the
test
however
which
is
announced
in
those
cases
and
reaffirmed
in
craig
and
boren
later
on,
that
is
as
i
understand
this
court's
opinions
today
the
test
that
it
believes
applies.
i
grant
you
that
it
was
a
foreign
commerce
context
in
the
idlewild
case,
but
it
was
not
in
seagrams,
that
was
in
interstate
commerce
context
and
that
the
same
test
was
applied
and
i
believe
it
is
the
test
which
controls
today.
the
question
is
for
decision
in
this
case
is
what
does
the
test
mean?
mr.
jack
b.
owens
seagram
was
on
the
face
opinion
as
you
remember.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
it
was
not
and
as
applied
case.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir.
i
think
a
key
factor
to
keep
in
mind
with
regard
to
seagram's
is
that
when
the
court
through
your
opinion
reached
the
question
of
whether
affirmation
as
you
recall
that
was
a
system
by
which
the
seller
had
to
affirm
that
it
prices
in
new
york
were
as
the
low
as
prices
elsewhere,
when
you
reached
that
particular
point
in
the
opinion
as
the
court,
you
concluded
that
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
was
not
irresistibly
compelled
by
the
affirmation
system.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir,
in
the
seagram's
case,
there
were
variety
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
it
was
a
burden
on
commerce
claim,
there
was
an
antitrust
claim
when
you
reach
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir.
when
you
reached
the
antitrust
sherman
act
claim,
you
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
that
was
before
you
that
you
could
not
determine
that
a
violation
of
sherman
act
was
irresistibly
compelled
by
the
statute.
now,
you
have
that
case.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes,
by
the
way
statute
worked,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
but
what
you
have
before
us
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
as
i
say
you
were
the
author
of
the
opinion
(voice
overlap)
that
i
believe
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
believe
the
robinson-patman
portion
of
the
opinion
takes
away
the
native
implication,
that's
your
basis
because
there's
no
extraterritorial
effect
there.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
and
in
any
event,
i
believe
the
sense
of
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
is
to
adopt
the
standard
announced
in
that
case
as
controlling
in
these
cases.
there
was
a
question
raised
about
horizontal
price
fixing.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
clearly
sorted
out
or
whether
i
will
be
able
to
do
that
but
the
state
statute,
section
24753
prohibits
horizontal
price
fixing.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
delusional
price
fixing
apart
from
the
act,
apart
from
the
information
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
not
authorized
by
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
don't
think
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
however,
on
the
horizontal
point
it's
important
to
understand
that
what
happens
is
exactly
what
mr.
justice
stevens
was
suggesting
is
through
this
vertical
system,
you
have
horizontal
effects.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
precisely,
precisely.
turning
to
the
standard
which
i
believe
controls
this
case
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
i
think
that
it's
clear
in
this
court's
opinion
as
the
absolutist
position
that
was
announced
by
the
other
side
has
been
rejected.
if
that
were
the
law,
frankfort
distilleries
could
not
be
correct
but
before
other
rulings
of
this
court
where
the
court
has
recognized
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
alcoholic-beverage
industry
would
all
have
to
be
(inaudible).
that
can't
be
the
law.
the
law
must
be
that
an
accommodation
must
be
reached
between
state
and
federal
interest
of
some
kind.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir
as
well
as
intrastate
effects.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
mr.
justice
black
stressed
the
extraterritorial
effects
in
frankfort
probably
because
of
his
own
personal
views
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
right.
however,
burke
v.
ford
which
is
a
unargued
precuriam
decision,
but
nonetheless
a
decision
of
this
court
is
a
case
of
wholly
intrastate
market
allocation
conspiracy
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
antitrust
law
applied
are
valid.
what
we
have
here
is
an
instance
of
activity
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
burke
v.
ford?
it's
a
fairly
modern
case.
i
don't
have
a
date
in
line
as
a
standard,
1967.
what
we
have
here
is
an
instance
of
activity
which
is
squarely
prohibited
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes,
it
does
sir
in
this
respect.
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
you
can't
freeze
the
situation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
it
existed
in
1933.
he
is
arguing
to
what
was
given
back
to
the
states
is
the
scope
of
the
commerce
clause
power
as
it
exists
today,
that's
his
position.
if
that
were
true
and
if
that
were
correct,
it
would
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
the
impossible
for
there
to
be
an
antitrust
prosecution
under
federal
law
even
if
the
state
did
not
authorize
the
behavior.
burke
v.
ford
is
squarely
on
that
point
and
squarely
resolves
that
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
should
be
resolved.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
that's
correct.
i
believe
it
is
not.
it
certainly
has
not
been
when
you
have
something
as
fundamental
as
the
sherman
act
an
activity
which
strikes
at
the
core
of
the
act.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir
that
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
that's
correct.
and
that
is
the
issue
put
by
this
case.
the
state
has
acted
and
our
position
is
that
where
you're
dealing
with
a
demand
that
private
parties
engaged
in
per
se
violations
of
the
sherman
act
federal
law
prevails
and
must
prevail
if
you
have
a
full
understanding
of
the
background
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
sir
just
as
i
would
argue
that
the
national
railroad
case
that
he
relies
on
which
is
summary
affirmance
is
about
the
same
situation,
but
i
think
it's
a
question
of
concept
more
than
question
of
holding.
if
his
position
were
correct,
the
sherman
act
would
be
in
total
abeyance
as
to
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
light
year
away
from
the
text
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
the
history
that
led
up
to
it.
on
the
state
action
point,
i
believe
there
is
some
independent
force
to
it.
a
critical
factor
is
the
absence
of
state's
supervision
or
control
of
any
respect
over
the
pricing.
if
this
kind
of
system
is
to
be
exonerated,
number
one
you
have
to
disavow
parker
and
schwegmann,
but
number
two
you
created
a
dangerous
system
by
which
states
can
simply
negate
federal
interest
by
declaration.
they
are
not
required
undertake
any
of
the
steps
that
are
necessary
to
serve
federal
interests
as
a
substitute.
i
don't
believe
the
twenty-first
amendment
requires
that,
i
don't
believe
the
state
action
doctrine
permits
it.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
agree
that
it
is
much
state
action.
my
position
is
that
it's
not
enough
to
override
the
sherman
act
and
i
think
that's
what
parker
means.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes,
it
does
in
this
respect.
so,
you're
dealing
with
competing
principles,
competing
interests.
you
can
find
a
way
to
protect
both
sets
of
interests
without
holding
to
get
into
federal
interest.
if
the
state
believes
that
resin
prices
serves
difference
(inaudible)
if
that's
what
the
state
concludes,
let
it
do
so
by
measuring
the
level
of
the
prices
itself
or
creating
some
system
that
pays
some
heed
to
federal
interest,
i.e.,
avoidance
of
excess
profit
taking
from
the
industry
by
the
producer.
if
you
let
us
simply
declare
price
fixing
valid,
there
is
no
way
given
to
the
federal
interest
underlying
the
sherman
act.
if
you
let
it
do
without
any
supervision,
there's
no
way
given
to
the
federal
interest
and
that
is
what's
wrong
with
this
system
and
what
is
indicated
in
parker
and
schwegmann.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no
sir.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
mr.
justice
douglas,
manage
to
do
within
schwegmann.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no
sir.
no,
because
i
believe
that
the
sherman
act
carries
with
it
not
only
the
technical
set
of
violations,
but
also
an
expression
of
fundamental
federal
policy,
a
pro-competition
policy
and
there's
no
question
that
this
statute
strikes
at
the
core
of
that
expression
in
the
policy.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
no,
not
necessarily
i
don't
think
it's
more
important
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
think
there
are
two
possible
reasons
why
it's
not.
one
is
there
is
--
if
we
assume
that
there
is
no
independent
communication
going
on
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
--
there
is
no
independent
contract
as
required
by
the
sherman
act.
you're
missing
technical
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
b.
owens
second
reason
is
that
even
if
you
--
you
if
i'm
wrong
about
that
if
i
understand
some
of
the
passages
in
your
opinion
in
candor
and
mr.
justice
blackmun's
writing
there
may
be
a
public
policy
exception
to
antitrust
liability
where
the
activity
was
mandated
by
the
state.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
that
would
be
a
conscious
parallelism
kind
of
question
relating
to
communication.
i
didn't
know
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
don't
believe
the
court
as
a
court
has
said
it
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
are
suggestions
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes
your
honor
and
i
find
support
for
that
in
particular
opinions
which
have
not
yet
commended
to
the
court.
i'm
sorry
i
was
diverted
from
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
think
the
sherman
act
is
necessarily
more
important
than
this,
the
other
thing.
my
position
is
a
very
important
body
of
federal
law
on
par
with
other
important
bodies
of
federal
law.
another
example
might
be
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
b.
owens
yes.
that's
not
--
i
know
you
don't
offer
that
question
in
just,
yes.
it's
possible
that
there
may
be
a
situation
which
the
federal
interest
doesn't
wait.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
i
think
it's
the
same
analysis
that
the
court
is
required
to
go
through
and
undertakes
a
preemption
analysis.
sometimes,
congress
is
very
clear
on
what
it
prohibits,
sometimes
it's
not.
mr.
jack
b.
owens
then
as
i
understand
the
twenty-first
amendment,
if
it's
not
simply
the
question
try
to
ban
importation
and
it
isn't
really
at
the
core
of
a
prohibition
or
temperance
related
system,
federal
interest
is
very
likely
to
prevail.
thank
you
your
honor.
