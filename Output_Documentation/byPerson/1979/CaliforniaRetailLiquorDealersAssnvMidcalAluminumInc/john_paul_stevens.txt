justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chidlaw,
just
to
pursue
that
for
second,
supposing
they
passed
a
statute
that
said
the
wages
of
a
driver
of
a
vehicle
transporting
liquor
from
place
to
place
within
the
state
shall
be
such
as
has
posted
by
whatever
company
engaged
in
the
driving
business,
sort
of
like
this
where
you
post
the
price
for
the
wholesale
and
everybody
has
to
follow,
why
couldn't
they
do
the
same
thing
to
regulate
wages
the
same
way,
either
the
union
or
the
employer
do
the
posting,
make
the
legislative
choice
and
then
prevail
over
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
want
to
be
sure
that
the
people
who
drive
are
adequately
paid
or
not
over
paid
just
as
--
what
is
the
state
interest
at
stake
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
there
be
a
state
interest
in
having
all
people
who
drive
large
trucks
containing
liquor
be
paid
the
same
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
some
drivers
you
paid
a
lot
more
than
others
while
the
people
that
they
deliver
to
have
a
higher
costs
for
paying
for
the
transportation
and
same
kind
of
--
economic
discrimination
that
you
have
in
different
prices
that
you
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
other
states
statutes
or
cartwright
act
and
some
of
the
others
that
prohibit
price
discrimination
in
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
see
why
you
hesitate
on
mr.
justice
white's
question
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
interest
would
be
--
rather
clear
there.
one
that
would
eliminate
the
discrimination
if
they
all
agreed
on
the
price
and
secondly
it
probably
would
tend
to
restrict
the
amount
of
goods
sold
because
generally
when
you
have
monopolistic
market
it
cuts
down
on
the
supply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
what
you
think
you
would
say
categorically
that
would
be
alright
for
a
state
to
authorize
concerted
action
to
restrict
the
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
shouldn't
the
legislative
same
policy
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
same
policy
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chidlaw,
i
think
i'm
not
sure
i
don't
suppose
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
argued
in
the
schwegmann
case
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
and
i
take
that
you
would
contend
the
case
should
have
been
decided
the
other
way
under
twenty-first
amendment,
schwegmann
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
right,
i
remember
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
fair
to
infer
that
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
board
does
not
agree
that
it's
necessary
to
follow
the
price
regulation
in
order
to
have
effective
regulation
because
as
i
understand
it
they
acquiesced
in
the
earlier
decision
indicated
in
papers
filed
here
that
they
are
sympathetic
with
the
other
side
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
take
it's
fair
to
infer
then
that
the
state's
right
to
regulate
could
be
adequately
protected
without
fair-trade
in
his
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
you
would
disagree
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roth,
would
it
comply
with
the
california
statute
for
a
wholesaler
who
handled
one
line
of
liquor,
wine
or
liquor,
to
say
that
the
price
to
be
charged
for
this
line
shall
be
the
price
that
the
wholesaler
“x”
posts
for
his
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
$6?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
every
time
wholesaler
changed
his
price
he'd
be
free
to
change
as
to
follow
it
of
course?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
here
everybody
has
to
--
you
know
there
be
more
prompt
compliance
with
the
changes
because
it
would
have
to
under
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
generally
thought
about
prices
in
sherman
act
context
are
going
up
but
there
is
also
a
line
of
thinking
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
that
sometimes
by
setting
a
price
very
low
one
can
drive
these
competitors
out
of
business
and
thereby
acquire
monopoly.
if
the
facts
would
show
that
a
very
large
producer
of
wine
or
liquor
wanted
to
enforce
a
very
low
predatory
price
in
order
to
drive
his
competitors
out
of
business,
he
compelled
a
wholesaler
to
sell
the
low
price
in
the
retail
and
return
to
sell
the
low
price
he
filed
very
low
price
schedules
in
the
state
for
that
purpose
and
says,
“purpose
was
plain
and
acknowledged.”
that
would
be
immune
from
sherman
act
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
to
an
area
where
his
conduct
would
violate
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
new
combination
in
my
example
is
all
by
himself
his
--
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
he
tried
to
get
a
monopoly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does
it
below
cost,
it's
way
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
liquor,
it's
not
the
general
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
should
think
he'd
be
immune?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
owens
i
haven't
read
burke
v.
ford,
i
just
don't
remember.
is
that
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
that
was
challenged
has
been
specifically
authorized
and
approved
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
really
isn't
to
help
as
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
little
bit
like
the
argument
to
the
federal
government
still
retains
the
power
to
put
the
minimum
wages
and
safety
standards
and
other
things
involving
the
liquor
industry,
it's
a
little
bit
like,
that's
the
same
argument
that
the
federal
power
over
the
liquor
industry
within
california
is
not
--
has
not
been
surrendered
through
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
an
intermediate
position
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter
expounds
in
his
concurring
opinion
frankfort
which
i
think
would
be
sufficient
to
defeat
you,
in
other
words,
that
if
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
effect
gave
the
power
to
the
state
to
act
without
violating
the
sherman
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
concurred
there
on
the
ground
that
colorado
had
not
approved
of
the
combination
state
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
owens,
i
understand
your
argument
that
the
scheme
is
in
direct
conflict
with
federal
antitrust
policy,
do
you
contend
that
anyone
has
whose
complied
with
the
california
law
has
actually
violated
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
no
sherman
act
violation,
how
do
we
find
the
conflict
with
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
also
find
a
difficult
on
judge
plain
how
he
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
go
one
step
further
with
you
on
my
--
if
there
is
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
is
it
because
there's
no
concerted
action
or
is
it
because
following
a
state
law
it
cannot
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
first
reason
that
there
would
still
be
no
sherman
act
violation
if
we
held
the
statute
that
the
california
statute
bad
and
the
various
people
in
the
business
continue
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
by
independent
decision
and
say
this
is
the
price
making
him
recommended
rather
than
the
mandate
that
which
--
would
that's
obvious,
i'm
not
saying
