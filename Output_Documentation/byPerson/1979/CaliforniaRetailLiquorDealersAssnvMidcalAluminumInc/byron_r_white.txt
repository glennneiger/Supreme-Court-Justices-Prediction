justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
suggest
to
the
state
could
just
have
a
statute
that
authorized
price-fixing
generally
if
people
wanted
to
engage
in
it?
just
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
policy
and
are
--
well,
no
in
liquor
that
as
the
state
statute
it
says
price-fixing
of
any
kind
in
the
liquor
business
will
not
be
illegal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why,
why
they
say
pursuant
to
our
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
though
in
your
view
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
--
you
certainly
say
that
a
manufacturer
can
set
a
standard
price
for
all
retailers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
that
you
could
with
the
same
reason
you
could
--
the
state
could
make
price
discrimination
illegal.
i
mean
legal,
quite
legal
that
someone
want
to
do
prefer
certain
retailers
over
some
others
or
they
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
equal
protection
what
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
got
more
reached
than
the
commerce
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
handles
to
the
other
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
price
level
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
price
level
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
fall?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
not
any
issue
here
about
his
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
is
any
state
statute
setting
the
price
on
liquor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
or
at
least
the
similar
argument
if
the
--
if
it
--
whether
or
not
to
set
a
price
was
optional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
was,
suppose
a
producer
was
free
not
to
post
the
price
but
he
could
and
if
he
did
then
why
retailers
were
bound
to
sell
at
that
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
so
you
wouldn't
be
here
making
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
would
you
defend
that
system
as
exempt
from
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
law
isn't
--
aren't
the
producers
are
all
free
to
agree
among
themselves
--
what
on
a
standard
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
you
would
say
that
if
the
producer
did
get
in
carrying
out
their
obligations
to
post
prices
they
can
all
get
together
and
post
the
same
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
well,
nothing
prohibited,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
prohibit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
sherman
act
would
apply
if
all
the
producers
in
this
case
got
together
and
agreed
on
the
standard
price
and
all
posted
the
same
price
you
would
say
the
sherman
act
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
producer
gets
--
what
if
the
producer
has
a
--
knows
where
all
of
his
--
where
is
the
merchandise
goes
and
all
the
retailers
and
the
distributors
who
are
handling
his
goods
he
--
once
a
year
he
gets
them
together
this
place
and
says
let's
all
figure
out
what
my
posted
price
should
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
would
this
--
would
you
argue
that
the
state
law
would
protect
that
kind
of
an
agreement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
it
has
to
be
an
individual
unilateral
determination
by
the
producer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
twenty-first
amendment
if
any
add
to
parker
anything
at
all
in
your
view
via-s-via
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
twenty-first
would
permit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
else
you
can
think
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
vertical
price
fixing?
i
mean,
agreed
upon
price
fixing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
before
he
announces
his
price,
he
gets
his
retailers
and
distributors
together
and
they
all
agree
on
a
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
authorized
prohibited.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
the
horizontal
price
fixing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
year
was
that?
