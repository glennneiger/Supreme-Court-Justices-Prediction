justice

it
does
follow.
justice
potter
stewart
authorize
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereby
exempted
entirely
from
the
anti-trust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
your
answers.
if
you
are
correct
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
removes
the
federal
government
from
any
exercise
of
the
power
under
its
--
under
the
commerce
clause
then
when
and
how
could
the
federal
government
prosecute
action
simply
because
they
were
unauthorized
by
state
law?
the
state
could
of
course
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
why
and
how
the
federal
government
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
not
authorized
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
your
--
that's
the
thrust
of
your
twenty-first
amendment
argument
doesn't
go
very
far,
doesn't
go
nearly
so
far
for
example
as
justice
black's
field.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
more
a
parker
against
brown
argument,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
talking
about
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
so
far
it
has
not
the
federal
government
in
your
view
still
retains
power
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
so
far
short
of
justice
brandeis'
view
or
justice
black's
view,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
justice
brandeis'
view
prevailed
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
he
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court
and
the
young
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
plus
parker
against
brown
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
apart
from
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
i
understood
this
is
a
state
monopoly
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
mean
parker
against
brown
would
cover
that
quite
apart
from
the
twenty-first
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
state
could
engage
an
action
that
in
other
context
would
be
a
very
clear
violation
of
the
non-economic
--
certainly
the
commerce
clause
itself
it
could
totally
prohibit
the
importing
into
a
state
of
intoxicating
liquors,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could
not
do
for
a
lumber
or
eggs
or
even
garbage,
could
you?
justice
potter
stewart
or
impose
a
very
high
duty
or
tax
i
think
which
you
couldn't
do
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
idlewild
decision
is
sought
to
be,
indeed
can
be
wholly
explain
in
the
basis
of
proposition
that
that
was
international
commerce
not
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
more
than
just
a
factual
distinction.
that
was
the
case
in
that
opinion
and
as
we
at
least
know
now
as
a
result
of
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
wrote
for
the
court
last
term
i
think
that
the
power
to
regulate
international
commerce
is
somewhat
different
from
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
black
in
dissent
in
that
case
saw
it
as
simply
as
sale
in
new
york
state.
justice
potter
stewart
seagram
held
that
new
york
could
invalidly
do
it
precisely
what
they
done,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
because
the
--
it
have
been
state.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
was
not
a
sherman
act
case
as
such,
it
was
a
constitutional
attack
upon
the
validity
of
the
new
york
provisions
which
had
been
tried
and
the
provisions
have
been
upheld
in
the
new
york
court
--
state
court
system.
it
wasn't
a
federal
antitrust
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
among
other
claims
where
the
claims
that
this
--
this
what
new
york
could
permitted
violated
the
sherman
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
antitrust
act?
justice
potter
stewart
equal
projection,
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
involved
effect
as
i
remember
in
other
states
outside
of
the
state
in
new
york,
that
was
the
claim,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
there
at
least
to
negative
implication
that
had
the
effect
clearly
confined
to
new
york
whatever
that
effect
might
have
been,
it
would
have
been
immunized
from
antitrust
vulnerability
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
asking
you,
you're
the
reader
of
the
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
frankfort
distilleries
involve
the
effects
of
conduct
and
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
on
states
other
than
the
legislating
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn't
the
former
emphasized
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
relied
upon?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
but
it
was
a
court
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
if
you
do
think
so,
are
we
allowed
to
think
so
or
say
so?
