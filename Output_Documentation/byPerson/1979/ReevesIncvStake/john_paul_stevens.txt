mr.
kirven,
do
you
know
if
there
has
been
any
change
in
the
capacity
of
the
south
dakota
cement
plant
since
it
was
first
put
in
--
started
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
if
the
state
were
to
restrict
its
sales
or
consumption
of
its
--
its
output
to
public
facilities
such
as
public
highways,
public
buildings,
bridges
and
the
like,
would
you
think
you
have
any
objection
to
that,
any
constitutional
objection
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
say
there'll
be
no
objection
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that
once
it
goes
into
the
open
market
it
should
be
treated
like
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
state
can
restrict
its
purchases
of
supplies
for
various
public
uses
to
instate
sources?
could
they
buy
all
their
printing
and
all
their
paper
and
all
their
own
--
say
they
didn't
operate
their
own
thing
from
local
sources,
just
to
favor
a
local
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
governor,
supposing
the
state
owns
all
the
land
on
which
the
raw
materials
for
cement
are
available,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
if
somebody
else
comes
in
and
--
how
could
someone
else
come
in
and
go
into
the
cement
business
if
you
owned
all
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
raw
materials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
of
the
facts,
but
assume
they're
concentrated
in
a
certain
area
and
that
you
happen
to
own
that
as
public
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you've
opened
up
the
--
the
cement
market
to
private
people
by
selling
to
private
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
governor,
do
you
think
the
south
dakota
could
charge
one
price
to
local
residents
and
a
higher
price
to
people
in
wyoming?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
there
in
--
you
think
the
wyoming
purchases
are
entitled
to
be
treated
equally
with
the
south
dakota
purchasing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
terms
of
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not
in
terms
of
quantity
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
not
in
terms
of
quantity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
between
subsidizing
local
residents
by
giving
them
a
bargain
and
subsidizing
local
residents
by
letting
them
have
all
the
available
supply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
governor,
you
mentioned
that
there's
about
$40
million
been
invested
in
the
plant.
do
the
public
records
disclose
whether
or
not
over
the
period
of
its
life,
the
plant
has
been
profitable
or
unprofitable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
but
in
taking
the
entire
period
into
account.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
to
tell
me
--
you
can't
tell
me
whether
the
plants
made
money
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
there
been
years
in
which
general
revenues
have
been
applied
to
the
fund
to
keep
it
from
losing
money?
i
mean
your
--
to
keep
it
going.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
--
then
isn't
that
a
fair
inference
that
the
plant
has
over
the
years,
made
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
they
always
have
--
if
they
--
if
every
year
in
which
they
do
something,
it's
always
giving
money
to
the
general
revenues.
it
seems
to
me
the
interference
is
inescapable
they've
made
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
never
defaulted
any
of
those
loans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
ever
defaulted
on
any
of
those
loans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
know
whether
the
plant
has
made
money
or
not.
that's
--
the
bottom
line
as
far
as
your
answer
to
my
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
governor,
you
--
you
rely
heavily
on
the
distinction
between
proprietary
and
government
functions
and
you
argue
as
i
understand
you
in
substance
that
you're
just
like
a
private
proprietor
who
can
make
a
private
decision
not
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
sell
to
somebody
who
doesn't
want
to
sell
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
decision
to
confine
your
sales
to
local
residents
really
motivated
by
proprietary
considerations
or
by
a
governmental
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
local
citizens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say,
if
this
were
a
privately
owned
entity,
well,
is
there
any
reason
in
the
world
why
it
would
limit
its
sales
to
local
residents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
presumably,
that's
done
for
--
for
economic
--
for
the
economic
gain
of
the
--
of
the
seller,
but
you
don't
contend
that
this
is
an
economically
motivated
respect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
governor,
you're
not
limiting
the
sales
because
a
private
business
would
do
that.
when
you
limit
the
sales,
you're
acting
like
a
government.
and
i
don't
see
why
it's
different
for
the
government
to
limit
its
own
sales
when
it's
doing
it
for
governmental
purpose
and
for
it
to
limit
the
sole
private
seller
in
the
state
for
a
governmental
purpose.
and
you
admit,
he
couldn't
do
the
latter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
admitted
that
if
there
were
a
private
owner
of
the
plant,
the
government
of
south
dakota
could
not
accomplish
the
purpose
it
sought
here
by
saying,
“you
may
only
sell
to
south
dakota.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
--
that
governmental
purpose
would
not
justify
that
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
i
think
you've
also
acknowledged
that
in
operating
the
plant,
although
you
normally
operate
like
a
private
entrepreneur
with
respect
to
this
particular
decision
to
limit
the
sales
to
south
dakota
residents,
you're
acting
for
governmental
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
there's
a
violation
of
that,
mr.
kirven,
isn't
really
your
point
that
--
no
reason
why
a
private
seller
would
restrict
its
sales
for
a
governmental
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
reason
they're
doing
it
is
they
have
said
themselves,
“it's
for
governmental
reason,
not
for
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
any
private
economic
reason.”
