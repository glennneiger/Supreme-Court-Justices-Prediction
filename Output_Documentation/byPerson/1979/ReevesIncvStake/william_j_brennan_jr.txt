justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kirven,
i
don't
really
like
--
the
court
fully
--
why
you
think
alexandria
is
distinguishable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
suggest
is
that
maryland
had
a
state
interest,
an
important
state
interest
which
was
served
by
a
manner
in
which
they
limited
the
pick
up
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
did
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
the
end
use
today
of
the
production
of
the
cement
plant
is
in
every
case
in
a
public
building
or
a
public
road
or
something
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
could
go
into
an
apartment
building,
to
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
which
--
to
which
the
purchase
and
as
long
as
he's
a
south
dakotan,
wants
--
wants
to
put
if
he
make,
it
may
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
any
idea
what
the
percentage
is
that
goes
in
the
private
as
against
the
public
enterprise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
the
commission
suspended
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
it
will
sell
to
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
reeves
can
get
all
at
once?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me,
governor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
south
dakota
customer,
i
gather
he'd
have
to
be
the
one
who
did
what
the
chief
justice
suggest,
namely,
establish
a
place
of
business
in
--
in
south
dakota?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
reeves
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
reeves
be
a
south
dakota
customer
if
it
came
to
--
to
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
--
but
is
it
the
fact
that
--
i
understood
you've
got
some
72,000
units
of
--
yesterday,
was
it?
are
you
getting
all
you
need
now?
is
reeves
getting
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
and
the
prospect
is
that
a
--
you
may
be
able
for
some
while
to
get
all
you
need?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
construction
season?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
