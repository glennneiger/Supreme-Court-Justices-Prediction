justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
didn't
have
a
--
a
long-term
contract
for
delivery.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
kirven,
about
30
years
ago,
south
dakota
had
a
bad
year
for
pheasants
and
it
was
decreed
that
no
minnesota
or
wyoming
or
non-south
dakota
hunter
could
come
into
south
dakota
and
hunt
pheasants.
the
--
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
upheld
that
ruling
and
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal.
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
case
adversely
to
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
this
program
specifically
upheld
instate
printing
requirements?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
there
always
seems
to
be
a
man
named
hughes
in
this
area,
but
not
in
your
case.
you
mentioned
that
hughes
against
oklahoma,
do
you
think
that
case
is
closer
to
this
one
than
hughes
against
alexandria
scrap?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
feel
then,
it
had
touched
in
your
favor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
oh
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
is
another
distinction,
but
i
question
whether
it's
worth
anything.
in
alexandria,
the
state
was
the
purchaser.
here,
it's
the
seller.
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
governor,
does
south
dakota
have
any
other
special
enterprises
like
this
cement
plant?
your
neighbor
to
the
north
has
the
bank
of
north
dakota.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
--
are
you
in
any
other
business
beside
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sure.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
mr.
justice
white's
question
before
the
recess
about
the
denver
contractor
doing
a
job
in
south
dakota
is
answered
differently
now
than
--
than
before.
