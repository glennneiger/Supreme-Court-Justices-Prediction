mr.
william
j.
janklow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
begin
the
oral
argument,
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
by
members
of
the
court
to
counsel
during
his
argument.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
south
dakota
is
in
the
cement
business
comes
as
a
direct
result
of
the
south
dakota
citizens
being
in
the
teens
and
the
20s,
some
50,
60,
70
years
ago,
about
70
years
ago
being
unable
to
get
the
cement
they
needed
to
do
the
things
that
normal
society
carries
on,
things
like
building
hospitals,
building
schools,
building
roads.
a
good
analysis
is
--
of
this
is
found
in
the
eakin
case
that
--
that
both
of
us
have
cited
in
our
briefs.
and
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
made
very,
very
specific
findings
in
its
determination
of
the
eakin
case.
it
found,
for
example,
that
cement
and
its
products
are
commodities
that
are
necessary
to
the
people
of
south
dakota.
they
cannot
be
produced
at
the
present
time
through
individual
effort,
that
the
construction
of
highways,
bridges,
streets,
pavings,
sidewalks
and
public
buildings
within
the
state,
cement
is
necessary.
they
found
that
the
use
of
cement
is
rapidly
increasing
in
south
dakota
that
a
serious
shortage
of
the
supply
of
cement
is
threatening
to
the
people
of
the
state.
that
there
had
been
a
shortage
on
many
occasions
during
the
previous
years,
but
the
shortage
has
interfered
with
and
delayed
both
public
and
private
enterprises,
that
the
materials
for
making
of
cement
are
found
in
large
quantities
and
at
necessary
points
within
the
state.
i
think
that
answers
a
couple
questions
that
have
been
raised.
in
addition
to
that,
nobody
can
cite
any
statute
any
place.
in
the
history
of
south
dakota
that
says
anybody
who
wants
to,
including
mr.
reeves
from
wyoming,
can't
come
to
south
dakota
and
go
in
the
cement
business.
there
is
no
statute
that
says
that
mr.
reeves
can't
come
over
and
haul
our
raw
materials
over
the
wyoming
and
make
cement.
there's
no
regulation.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
sure
it
would.
as
far
as
south
dakota
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
you
mean
all
through
out
the
entire
state
of
south
dakota?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think,
i'll
argue
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
that
as
long
as
it
wasn't
opened
up
to
anyone,
that
they
wouldn't
have
an
argument.
i
think
once
it
was
opened
up
to
some
private
people,
it
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
that's
not
even
approaching
the
case
that
we
have
in
this
situation.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
but
that's
no
different
than
a
private
individual,
unless
--
unless
it's
being
suggested
that
somehow
in
the
history
of
the
commerce
clause
that
there's
been
a
dual
standard
set
up
that's
different
for
government
than
it
is
for
private
individuals.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir,
not
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
place,
i
don't.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
because
i
think
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
would
apply.
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
in
terms
of
price?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
would,
yes.
why
not?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
pardon
me?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
because
i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
a
discrimination
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
there's
a
valid
state
purpose,
they
don't
go
behind
it.
you
--
you
got
a
different
standard
completely
when
you're
talking
about
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
this
--
the
--
the
issue
is,
is
what
is
government
falling
for?
and
we
have
government
in
south
dakota
as
they
do
every
place
else
to
take
care
of
the
need
of
its
citizens.
our
government
in
south
dakota
doesn't
function
for
wyoming
citizens
or
iowa's
or
florida's
or
anybody
else's.
it
generally
functions
for
the
needs
of
the
citizens
of
south
dakota.
and
the
endeavors
and
the
engagements
and
the
functions
that
we
get
into
are
those
things
that
have
been
determined
as
a
legislative
policy
to
be
the
things
that
the
citizens
of
south
dakota
need.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
it.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
the
court
could
picture
this
and
notice
the
fact.
that's
around
$40
million,
because
the
records
of
south
dakota
which
are
public
records
would
indicate
it's
about
$40
million.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
over
the
period
of
time
since
the
cement
plant
was
built.
the
capital
and
the
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
couldn't
do
that
that.
that
would
be
an
absolute
constraint
against
the
commerce
clause
and
we
agree
to
that.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes.
we
can
do
it
as
long
as
the
state
owns
the
plant.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
and
this
court
has
--
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
previous
decisions
in
the
alexandria
case.
the
maryland
case,
this
court
--
justice
powell's
decisions
specifically
alluded
to
that.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
absolutely.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
there's
never
been
any
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
absolutely.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
and
once
we
--
the
--
the
--
we
think
the
key
issue
in
this
case
is,
are
we
a
regulator
or
are
we
in
a
proprietary
aspect
of
government.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
if
we
are
regulating
interstate
commerce
in
a
direct
sense
or
even
in
an
indirect
sense,
then
we
think
that
we
fall
under
the
commerce
clause.
if
we're
not,
we
don't
think
we
fall
under
it
at
all
and
that's
where
we
think
the
key
distinctions
of
this
case
are.
this
is
no
different
in
colleges.
the
governments
get
into
colleges.
we
charge
people
tuitions,
some
states
more,
some
states
less,
but
nobody
would
argue
that
south
dakota
can't
prohibit
all
out-of-staters
from
coming
to
its
state
schools,
because
of
the
investment
we've
made
and
trying
to
educate
our
people.
now
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
states
allow
out-of-staters,
but
there's
a
discriminatory
policy
that
every
state
has
that
basically
favors
their
own
citizens.
and
providing
an
education
isn't
really
any
different
than
providing
the
buildings
that
people
go
to,
to
get
their
education
or
the
houses
that
they
live
in
when
they're
growing
up.
as
far
as
paying
taxes,
the
question
was
raised
and
i
think
the
court
could
take
just
--
judicial
notice
of
the
statute
to
south
dakota,
although
it's
not
in
the
record
that
the
--
the
state
cement
plant
does
pay
severance
taxes
to
the
state
government,
just
exactly
like
homestake
gold
mine,
the
gravel
pits
and
the
other
aspects
of
enterprise
that
deal
with
the
severability
or
that
deal
with
--
with
severable
resources
being
taken
from
the
state.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
pardon
me?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we're
one
of
three
states
that
doesn't
have
that.
we
--
we
don't
have
an
income
tax,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
have
property
taxes
and
--
and
the
property
tax
fee,
we're
going
on
in
our
state
also.
but
the
property
taxes
are
paid
to
local
government
by
the
state
cement
plant,
again
under
a
statute
authorized
by
the
state
legislature.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
--
it
has
--
it
has
been
both.
it
is
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
when
you
talk
about
profit
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
has
had
at
--
at
the
--
over
the
entire
period
of
time,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
can
tell
you
there
are
years
when
its
cash
flow
is
plus
and
years
when
its
cash
flow
is
a
minus.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
call
that
profit
or
nonprofit
because
the
state
doesn't
--
governmental
accounting
doesn't
take
into
consideration,
historically,
the
payment
of
taxes.
it
doesn't
take
into
consideration
depreciation
and
the
bookkeeping
methods.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
--
i
can
tell
you
that
it
ends
up
some
years
with
a
cash
surplus,
but
in
terms
of
bottom-line
net.
in
terms
of
proper
accounting,
i
can't
tell
you
if
that's
a
profit,
but
i
can
--
but
i
can
tell
you
every
year
for
the
last
several
years
--
for
example,
this
year,
the
legislature
and
the
preparation
of
its
annual
budget
has
ordered
that
$9
million
will
be
transferred
from
the
state
cement
plant
to
the
state
general
fund
to
assist
in
reaching
a
balance
budget.
last
year,
it
was
$7
million,
the
previous
year,
it
was
$5
million.
but
there
have
been
years
when
nothing
has
been
transferred
because
there
wasn't
any
--
any
excess
cash.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
to
my
knowledge,
no,
because
they've
had
the
bond
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no.
it
has
had
positive
cash,
but
that's
not
making
money.
you
can
end
up
with
excess
cash
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
lose
money,
because
they
may
not
be
funding
their
depreciation.
they
may
not
be
putting
funds
aside
for
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
there
are
years
when
they
borrow
money
when
they're
short.
several
years
ago,
they
borrowed
several
million
dollars.
they
have
the
power
and
borrow.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
pardon
me?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir.
to
my
knowledge,
no,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
right.
in
accounting
sense,
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
william
j.
janklow
or
any
other
private
enterprise.
and
i
think
the
thing
that
we
have
to
keep
in
the
context
is
as
both
briefs
will
indicate,
what
happened
in
1978
to
cause
this
problem?
we
had
a
new
kiln
coming
online
and
the
new
kiln
was
really
to
replace
the
old
kilns
which
were
built
50
or
70
years
ago
or
i
should
--
about
70
years
ago.
their
pollution
--
they
have
a
lot
of
pollution
and
this
new
kiln
will
equal
the
production
of
the
old
ones.
it
just
so
happens
there
was
such
an
incredible
demand
for
cement
about
the
time
this
was
done,
they
didn't
shut
the
old
ones
down,
they've
been
pumping
it
out
as
fast
as
they
could
ever
since.
but
there's
a
limited
lifespan
available
to
those
other
ones.
is
plaintiff
in
this
case
arguing
that
we
could
force
them
to
buy
cement
from
us,
if
they
ever
quit
buying
from
us
on
the
theory
that
their
refusal
to
buy
from
us
is
an
interference
in
interstate
commerce?
for
them
to
be
logical,
they're
going
to
have
to
concede
that
point.
that
--
they
can't
just
put
all
the
burden
on
us
and
say,
“if
they
choose,
they
can
come
to
us
and
buy,
but
we
can't
choose
to
force
them
to
buy
from
us.”
and
the
logic
would
be
the
same.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
it
does,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
were
in
a
coal
business
in
the
1930s
and
we
went
broke
and
we
were
on
rural
credits
in
the
1930s
and
we
went
broke.
these
--
these
are
enterprises
that
flow
from
that
old
la
follette,
wild
bill
langer
in
north
dakota
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
nor
back
in
south
dakota
tradition
that
grew
up
back
in
the
1920s
and
1930s
where
that
populous
tradition
that
the
government
into
those
fundamental
services
that
wasn't
being
provided
and
couldn't
be
provided
at
that
time
by
private
enterprise.
we,
who
consider
ourselves
very
conservative
state,
have
a
state-owned
cement
plant.north
dakota
has
got
a
bank
in
there
and
is
in
the
grain
business
and
i
think
they
also
still
have
a
coalmine
in
north
dakota.
nebraska
is
in
the
power
of
business
and
we
don't
allege
for
a
minute
that
we
can
go
down
and
ask
nebraska
public
power
district
and
force
them
to
sell
us
electricity
because
they
do
go
across
state
lines
in
the
grid.
they're
hooked
into
the
national
grid
and
that
was
brought
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it's
local
governments.
the
rule
of
electric
administrations
and
private,
the
investor
on
utilities,
the
reas
and
municipal
governments,
there
are
many
communities
that
have
their
own
municipal
power
plants
throughout
the
entire
upper
midwest.
some
of
whom
still
have
them,
most
of
them
whom
are
now
hooked
into
the
major
power
companies.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no.
and
to
my
knowledge,
no.
we
didn't
lend
on
farms
outside
the
south
dakota,
but
if
you
go
all
the
way
back
to
1920,
how
did
we
start
selling
the
wyoming?
way
back
in
1920,
the
record
will
disclose
in
the
appendix
that
the
minutes
of
the
commission
back
in
1920
specifically
stated
that
if
they
ever
had
any
excess
over
and
above
their
needs
for
south
dakotans,
they
would
make
it
available
to
other
people.
that
--
and
when
we
ran
into
this
problem
in
1978,
what
did
our
commission
do?
it
said,
“we
will
give
preference
to
south
dakotans
and
everybody
we
have
a
contract
with.”
and
reeves
comes
in
here
and
argues
and
it
in
come
to
all
the
courts
and
argued.
we
didn't
have
a
contract.
the
briefs
will
show
or
the
record
will
show
that
we
had
75,000
tons
under
contract
at
the
time
we
ran
into
trouble.
and
our
cement
plants
said,
“we
will
fulfill
those
contracts
irrespective
of
where
those
people
happen
to
be
located
any
place
in
america,
plus
we
will
take
care
of
south
dakotans
and
after
we've
taken
care
of
south
dakotans
and
fulfilled
our
contracts,
we
will
go
first-come,
first-serve
to
everyone.”
what
they're
complaining
about
is
the
policy
we
established.
theirs
would
be
that
you
taken
on
the
order
of
either
first-come,
first-serve
which
--
which
is
nonsense.
you'd
force
people
to
just
go
put
in
a
big
order,
bigger
than
they
needed,
so
they
could
sell
it
to
others
in
terms
of
the
shortage
or
two,
if
it
was
on
a
pro
rata
basis
to
put
in
a
bigger
order
than
they
needed,
hoping
to
get
a
larger
share
of
what
they
actually
needed.
what
they're
complaining
about
really
--
reeves
is
complaining
that
he
didn't
have
the
foresight
to
go
sign
a
contract
with
the
cement
plant
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
and
fulfill
our
contracts.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir.
it's
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
--
it
does.
it
does.
it's
generally
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
everybody
made
today.
since
90
--
since
june
of
a
year
ago,
there's
been
no
restriction
again,
because
the
production's
up.
so
everybody
is
being
taken
care
of,
but
i
would
end
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
that
south
dakotans
would
come
first,
but
it
does
not
go
into
just
the
public
enterprises.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
can
tell
you
that
a
year
ago,
i
think
the
record
would
show
that
of
the
750,000
tons.
some
place
rather,
278,000
just
went
into
highway
paving
contracts
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.a
year
ago,
we
had
to
stop
the
building
of
the
poor
indians
housing
on
the
reservations
and
the
record
reflects
that.
we
had
to
stop
the
building
of
the
school
in
spearfish,
south
dakota,
because
--
and
the
record
will
reflect
that.
we
had
to
stop
the
building
of
hospitals
in
south
dakota
because
everybody
ran
out
of
cement.
there
just
wasn't
then.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir.
this
was
afterwards.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
this
was
afterwards.
they
were
just
--
the
only
reason
we
don't
have
another
year
like
that
this
year
is
because
interest
rates
are
20%
and
--
you
know
only
the
arabs
can
afford
to
buy
right
now.
that
to
build
anything,
nobody
else
can.
we
can't,
there's
anybody
in
midwest
that
can
afford
to
build
the
20%
interest
rates.
if
we
could,
we
wouldn't
spend
their
money
building
anything
out
there.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
--
to
be
logical,
i
have
to
say,
yes.
i
can't
think
--
i
--
i
can't
think
of
any.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
again,
i
think
that
--
that
you'd
have
to
look
at
--
first
of
all
--
well,
my
--
my
answer
would
be,
if
a
private
business
can
say,
if
coors
beer
can
say,
“we're
not
selling
of
south
dakota”.
if
--
if
wilsons
sporting
goods
could
say,
“we're
only
selling
east
of
the
mississippi
river,”
then
i
think
that
a
government
can
do
it.
i
don't
think
the
commerce
clause
drives
a
distinction
between
what
the
government
does
and
private
business
does
when
you're
talking
about
proprietary
functions
as
opposed
to
regulatory
functions.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i'd
say
yes,
but
and
my
but
is,
on
condition
that
congress
has
the
right
under
the
constitution
to
say
that
it
can't
be
done
that
way.
they
haven't
clearly
enunciated
that,
but
congress
does
have
the
right
because
everything
to
some
respect,
touches
commerce
and
we
don't
even
argue
that,
interstate
commerce.
and
as
a
result,
congress
could
proscribe
that
and
that
you'd
have
different
issue
--
set
of
issues.
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it's
by
governmental
interest
in
the
local
citizen
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
but
that
puts
us
into
the
proprietary
business.
there
are
some
people
who
go
into
business
for
goodwill
and
not
for
profit,
but
they
end
up
making
a
profit.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
have
to
say,
yes,
because
i
know
that
for
example,
half
of
america
screaming,
they
coors
beer
and
they
won't
sell
it
to
them,
only
some
states
get
it.
i
don't
know
why,
but
we
can't
get
it.
so
there
must
be
some
times
when
a
business
decision
is
made
to
limit
it
to
certain
geographical
territories.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
business?
not
at
all.
it's
a
governmentally
motivated
business,
a
public
policy
motivated
business.
mr.
justice
powell
said
in
--
in
the
alexandria
case
and
we
think
it's
just
--
and
i
hate
to
just
lift
certain
language
out
of
it,
but
it
ties
into
the
whole
thing
that
the
case
was
discussing,
nothing
in
the
purposes
animating
the
commerce
clause
forbids
the
state
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action
from
participating
in
the
market
and
exercising
the
right
to
favor
its
own
citizens
over
others.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
we
do,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
i
--
and
i'm
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
in
south
dakota?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
sure.
i
--
you
know
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
all
right,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no
--
no,
i
really
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
except
only
at
one
period
of
time
when
they
ran
out
and
that
honestly,
it
never
came
to
that
discussion.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
sir.
if
he
had
a
contact,
he
would've
been
taken
cared
of.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
except
everybody
that
bids,
i
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
in
the
--
in
the
bidding
industry,
a
contractor
has
a
got
firm
price
on
cement
before
he
goes
in
bids.
that's
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
at
that
particular
time,
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
understand
that
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
slightly
hesitated
because
we
do
have
provisions
under
our
state
law
that
give
preference
to
south
dakota
bidders
and
i
do
know
that
in
the
purchase
of
materials
in
personal
property
that
there
is
a
preference
for
south
dakota
and
just
like
the
florida
case,
the
askew
case,
but
i
can't
tell
you
whether
or
not
that
goes
all
the
way
to
road
bidding.
so
i
just
--
i
don't
know,
if
i'm
being
correct
factually
in
the
way
i
respond.
i
don't
know
that
it
carries
that
fact.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
this
--
this
--
not
really.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
state
cement
plant
is
an
independently
run
organization.
i
have
no
power
--
our
governor
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
--
the
legislature
would
have
to
change
the
law
to
--
to
tell
the
cement
plant
what
to
do.
they
have
independent
commissioners
that
once
their
appointed,
they're
--
they're
almost
sovereign
in
terms
of
--
of
how
they
do
their
own
business,
consistent
with
the
laws.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
would
by
agreement?
yes.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
but
for
--
for
plaintiff
to
be
correct,
you'd
have
to
look
at
a
whole
litany
of
--
it
just
so
happens
that
we
happen
to
be
dealing
in
cement,
other
states
that
deal
with
power,
every
state
with
their
educational
institutions.
maryland,
when
it
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
junk
cars.
all
of
these
things
that
when
you
get
on
a
quasi-proprietary
or
proprietary
area,
you
find
--
you'd
find
the
argument
that
somehow
it's
a
restraint
in
interstate
commerce.
it
just
--
it
just
doesn't
apply.
nobody
would
argue
that
a
private
business
couldn't
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
i,
as
a
--
as
a
person
that
wanted
to
build
a
new
private
factory,
could
provide
that
only
south
dakotans
bid.
i
could
provide
that
anybody
who
gets
the
contact
must
buy
their
cement
from
the
south
dakota
cement
plant.
and
certainly,
i
wouldn't
be
here
as
restraining
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
yes.
but
and
i
say
but,
because
there
is
a
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
well,
there
is
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
i
can't
because
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we're
dealing
with
a
corporation
here
and
i
do
draw
distinction
between
a
privileges
in
the
community's
--
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
says
i
can't
do
that
to
citizens.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
to
residents.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
to
residents.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
but
that's
no
different
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
what
we're
doing
is
what
a
private
business
can
do
and
nobody
argues
they
can't.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
don't
follow
you,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
could
lose.
if
--
if
somebody
opens
a
competing
modern
cement
plant,
rapid
city
is
only
30
miles
from
wyoming
across
the
border
in
wyoming
or
in
the
same
city,
they
could
drive
us
out
of
business.
we
may
be
inefficient.
like
all
government,
we
may
not
be
able
to
compete
with
private
enterprises,
if
they
set
up.
we
don't
know,
but
if
they
did,
we
wouldn't
be
here
complaining
that
somehow
their
competition
violates
the
commerce
clause.
what
they're
complaining
about
is
they
made
poor
market
decisions.
they
didn't
plan
ahead
any
better
than
we
did.
and
now,
somehow
they
want
us
to
be
--
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
responsibility
for
the
lack
of
their
foresight
in
making
a
wise
management
decision.
the
record
will
show
that
we
went
out
and
tried
to
buy
cement.
we
bought
cement
thousands
of
tons
of
it,
all
over
america
and
moved
it
into
south
dakota
and
sold
it
at
a
cheaper
price
than
we
bought
it
for,
to
try
and
take
care
of
people,
to
fulfill
our
contracts
and
to
take
care
of
others.
we
were
in
an
absolute
emergency
situation,
because
the
production
didn't
equal
the
demand.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it's
all
in
that
decision,
that
1920
south
dakota
supreme
court
decision.
they
enumerated
about
12
reasons,
but
the
reasons
were
there
were
no
cement
plants.
i
believe
the
record
says,
within
175
miles
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
up
to
the
state
of
south
dakota.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
right.
there
was
none
available
in
south.
there
was
no
cement
plant
in
south
dakota
and
i
believe
that
case
says
that
--
and
within
175
miles
of
south
dakota's
boarders
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
there
were
times
when
it
did
provide
it
at
a
loss.
there
are
--
reeves,
as
in
they're
arguing
today,
we've
got
cement
piled
up
over
the
place.
there's
no
demand
now,
because
there's
no
construction.
we're
not
here
suing
him
a
counterclaim,
but
arguing
that
he
ought
to
take
50,000
tons
from
us,
because
the
place
is
swimming
in
clinker
and
cement,
because
nobody
will
buy
it
right
now.
so
it's
just
--
they
happen
to
run
into
a
bad
time
last
year.
we're
in
a
bad
time
now
and
we're
not
suing
anybody.
we're
eating
our
loss.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
as
of
a
year
ago,
june,
as
--
last
june.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
now,
it
sells
to
anybody,
because
it
has
the
product
available
again.
it
can
take
care
of
everybody.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
reeves
--
reeves
got
two
--
reeves
got
72
tons
yesterday,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
checked
this
morning.
[laughs]
he's
been
getting
it
for
a
year.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
have
no
idea.
we
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
we
--
we
haven't.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
would
do
that.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
and
i
wouldn't
be
honest,
if
i
didn't
say.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
would
like
to
draw
a
correction,
if
i
may,
to
some
of
the
facts
that
i
stated
this
morning,
i
think,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
questions.
i
draw
your
attention
to
three
pages
in
the
appendix,
pages
31,
25
and
13.
it
deals
with
what
the
policy
is
of
the
cement
plant
commission,
and
i'll
read
it.
in
19
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
on
pages
31,
20
--
24
and
13
of
the
appendix.
it's
been
stated
three
times
historically.
the
first
time
was
in
1920
where
they
said,
and
i
quote,
“that
there
would
be
a
ready
market
for
the
entire
output
of
the
state
within
the
state.
in
case
there
is
a
surplus,
a
ready
market
is
available
in
adjoining
states.”
then
in
1974,
the
commission
in
its
minutes,
and
i
quote
from
the
minutes,
“the
commission
expressed
its
desire
that
south
dakota
customers
and
south
dakota
contracts,
not
residents,
but
south
dakota
customers
and
south
dakota
contracts
be
given
preference
in
compliance
with
the
constitutional
statutes
of
the
states,”
and
finally
in
1978
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
was
page
24
on
the
appendix,
at
the
bottom.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
and
finally,
on
page
13
under
the
commission
meeting
minutes
of
1978
of
june
1st,
and
i
quote,
“the
commission
discussed
the
plant's
major
commitments
requiring
approximately
218,000
tons
of
cement
for
1978
paving
projects
only.”
after
discussing
all
these
matters
at
considerable
length,
the
commission
reaffirmed
its
policy
of
supplying
all
south
dakota
customers
first
and
to
honor
all
contract
commitments
with
the
remaining
volume
allocated
on
a
first
come,
first
served
basis.
so
to
be
correct,
we
should
state
that
what
we
are
not
giving
preference
to
residents
but
to
customers
in
south
dakota
and
contractual
commitments
across
the
board.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
this
would
indicate
yes.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
this
would
indicate
yes.
this
would
indicate
that
he's
a
customer.
it
doesn't
say
a
preferences
to
south
dakota
residents
is
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
the
policy
within
the
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
but
i
can't
say
it
always
happens
that
way.
the
--
the
plaintiff
or
the
appellant,
i
should
say,
in
this
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
excuse
me.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
don't
know
that's
necessarily
the
case.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
for
a
job
in
south
dakota?
i
would
assume
that
he
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
if
this
was
discussed
in
--
at
the
lower
court
and
it's
in
the
transcript
of
the
--
unfortunate,
it
wasn't
a
trial
in
this
case,
it
all
was
done
on
a
tro.
and
there
were
arguments
of
counsel
with
no
testimony,
it
all
came
on
affidavits.
but
in
some
of
the
discussion,
the
testimony
from
the
trial
court,
from
the
hearing
on
the
tro,
you
can
see
where
the
discussion
was
made
where
the
state's
counsel
said
that
a
south
dakotan
could
even
buy
the
cement
and
--
and
we
couldn't
prohibit
them
from
showing
it
to
mr.
reeves.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
would
assume
--
i
would
like
to
say
no
but
i
would
assume
there
is
only
because
we
still
have
the
policy.
it
just
so
happens
we're
not
short
right
now,
so
it
may
be
moot
for
today
but
if
we
run
short
again,
i
would
have
to
tell
you
that
we
would
again
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
have
the
policy.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
it's
never
happened
before.
in
70
years,
it's
never
happened
before.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
we
would.
he
would
be
a
south
dakota
customer.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
that
this
court
would
--
this
goes
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well
--
well,
that's
no
different
than
--
i
would
say
yes,
we
could
sell
it
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
(voice
overlap)
private
business.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be.
that
would
be
a
south
dakota
contract.
there's
no
other
way
that
define
the
term
contract
as
it's
used
in
this
context.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
doesn't
say
contracts
entered
into
only
in
south
dakota.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
that's
why
i
brought
this
up.
i'm
sure
--
i
thought
mr.
stevens
would
--
is
mr.
justice
white's
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that's
correct.
and
we
could
do
the
same
thing
to
his
kids
who
wanted
to
go
to
school
in
our
state.
the
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
final
thing
for
about
five
seconds
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
--
is
that
this
case
was
sent
to
back
to
the
eighth
circuit
by
this
court
for
the
--
for
a
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
court's
decision
in
hughes
v.
oklahoma.
and
even
the
appellants
in
this
case
agree
that
that
case
isn't
--
doesn't
apply
and
they
try
and
evade
it.
and
that
we
all
agree
that
hughes
versus
--
the
alexandria
case,
the
hughes
case
from
maryland
is
the
one
that
--
really
is
the
one
that's
most
controlling
and
is
more
dispositive
of
the
case.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
our
public
records
would
show
that
virtually,
the
entire
state
of
south
dakota
can
be
used
for
making
cement
and
the
state
of
wyoming.
its
limestone,
coal
that
you
get
from
the
powder
river
basin,
they
have
part
of
the
ingredients
and
--
and
aggregate
--
the
materials
that
are
readily
available
virtually
all
of
america,
west
of
the
mississippi
river.
there
is
nothing
unique
about
these
particular
spots
that
we
happen
to
be
have
our
plant
located.
our
original
cement
plant
was
in
yankton,
south
dakota,
300
miles
east
--
400
miles
east
and
was
moved
to
rapid
city.
you
could
put
them
up
any
place.
minnesota
is
considering
doing
it
right
now
over
in
pike
stone
area.
thank
you.
