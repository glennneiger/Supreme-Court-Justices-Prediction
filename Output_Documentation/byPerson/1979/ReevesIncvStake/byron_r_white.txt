where
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
operating?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
capacity?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
it
get
its
raw
material,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
--
where
--
where
does
south
dakota
plant
get
its
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
the
rock,
the
--
the
lower
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
limestone.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
state-owned?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
only
quarry
like
that
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
sold
the
cement
plant
to
a
private
company
and
then
the
legislature
passed
a
law
saying
the
company
may
not
sell
outside
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
as
long
as
the
state
is
--
as
long
as
the
state
keeps
all
--
owns
the
plant,
you
can
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
governor,
i
take
it
then
that
if
--
if
you
have
a
--
if
you
open
a
contract
--
if
you
put
out
bids
for
building
a
highway,
do
you
let
foreigners
bid
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
though
they
aren't
residents
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
say
an
individual
--
say
an
individual
contractor
from
denver
operating
in
his
own
name,
comes
up
to
bid
up
there.
do
you
let
--
do
you
take
his
bid?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
sell
him
cement?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
restriction
--
doesn't
this
restriction
provide
for
sales
only
to
south
dakota
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
even
if
the
cement
was
going
to
be
used
in
south
dakota,
you
nevertheless,
would
bar
a
sale
to
a
nonresident?
that's
the
way
i
take
the
restriction
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
you
might
say
that
you're
keeping
--
you
--
you
want
the
cement
to
be
used
in
south
dakota,
but
you
really
are
saying
that
you
want
it
to
be
used
in
south
dakota
by
south
dakota
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
way
it
operates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you
again.
if
a
denver
contractor
came
up
and
bid
on
--
on
south
dakota
--
on
a
south
dakota
--
he
might
just
as
well
stay
at
home
because
he
couldn't
buy
cement
up
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
he's
not
resident.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
(inaudible)
he
you
wouldn't
bid.
he
wouldn't
bid
because
he
couldn't
get
--
because
you
wouldn't
sell
him
cement.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time
--
at
this
--
well,
i
know
but
that's
the
way
the
restriction
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
it'll
be
accepted
but
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
he
--
he
couldn't
buy
south
dakota
cement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
i'm
a
--
suppose
i'm
an
individual
in
the
--
in
the
retail
business
and
i
have
a
chain
and
i'd
like
to
come
up
and
--
and
establish
a
--
a
retail
outlet
in
south
dakota
and
i
have
to
build
--
i'd
like
to
--
i'm
going
to
build
and
--
so
i
want
to
buy
some
--
some
cement
from
south
dakota
and
they
say,
“are
you
a
citizen?”
and
you
--
and
i
say,
“no.”
and
you
say,
“sorry,
no
cement.”
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
--
now,
all
right
let's
take
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
take
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
take
the
period
of
shortage,
you
would
say,
“sorry,
you're
not
a
citizen.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
you
only
sell
south
dakota
cement
to
south
dakota
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
south
dakota
residents
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
only
to
south
dakota
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
these
fellows
--
and
you
say
to
this
fellow,
“are
you
a
south
dakota
resident?”
he
says,
“no,
i
just
want
to
do
business
in
south
dakota.
i
just
want
to
establish
and
i
want
to
build
a
building.”
justice
byron
r.
white
“sorry,
bring
in
your
cement
from
wyoming.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
case
all
--
what's
the
--
what's
this
suit
--
what's
left
of
this
suit
right
now?
why
isn't
it
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
suggested
that
it's
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
i
--
i
suppose
you
--
i
suppose
you
suggested
an
untimely
shortage
that
--
that
there
--
you're
very
likely
going
to
restrain
your
sales
to
citizens
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
governor,
suppose
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
answer
is.
suppose
a
south
dakota
contractor
bids
on
a
job
in
wyoming
and
he's
a
--
he
--
certainly,
he's
a
--
he's
a
citizen
of
south
dakota,
he's
a
resident
of
south
dakota,
he
does
business
in
wyoming,
will
you
sell
him
--
will
you
sell
him
cement
to
take
out
of
the
state
for
the
wyoming
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
a
south
dakota
contractor
can
--
can
compete
in
wyoming
with
--
with
south
dakota
cement
but
a
wyoming
contractor
cannot.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
thought
it's
a
say
yes
or
no,
it's
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
still
agree
that
the
--
you
still
agree
that
--
that
apparently,
that
peter
kiewit
from
omaha,
if
--
if
he
was
doing
a
job
in
the
northern
nebraska
and
wanted
to
buy
cement
from
south
dakota,
couldn't
buy
cement
from
south
dakota,
whereas
--
whereas
a
south
dakota
contractor
bidding
on
that
same
job
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
another
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
does
your
client
compete
with
any
south
dakota
contractors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
wyoming?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
they
can
buy
the
cement
and
you
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
--
they
are
--
they
are
bringing
the
cement
across
state
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
--
they
won't
let
you
buy
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
because
--
it's
because
you're
neither
a
south
dakota
contractor
or
out
--
nor
as
for
a
south
dakota
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
south
dakota
customers.
