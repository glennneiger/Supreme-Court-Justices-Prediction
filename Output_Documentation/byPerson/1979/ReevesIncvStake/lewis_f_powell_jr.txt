justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you've
emphasized
in
much
of
the
argument
the
necessity
from
the
view
point
of
your
state
to
have
the
cement
plant.
would
that
apply
to
a
sporting
good
equipment
plant
for
example?
what
i'm
interested
is
how
far
down
the
road
of
governmental
necessity
would
your
theory
take
you.
is
there
any
--
any
sort
of
manufacturing
plant
that
--
that
you
would
say
the
state
could
not
operate
and
impose
these
restrictions
on
its
product?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
what
about
my
example
say
as
--
the
plant
that
manufactured
ski
equipment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
not
likely
to
happen
in
this
country,
but
in
theory
at
least,
the
state,
i
suppose,
could
socialize
most
of
its
businesses
and
could
it
then
deny
to
interstate
commerce
the
products
of
all
of
those
businesses?
