chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
reeves,
incorporated
against
stake.
mr.
kirven,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
these
two
private
operations
having
gone
out
of
business,
this
is
hypothetical
now,
and
the
state
had
a
lot
of
road
building
to
carry
on,
and
so,
they've
set
up
their
own
cement
plant
for
their
own
road
construction,
not
for
commercial
purposes,
not
for
proprietary
purposes,
do
you
think
they'd
have
to
sell
cement
to
non-south
dakota
residents
just
because
they
were
maintaining
a
plant
for
their
own
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
it
--
is
it
because
they
have
entered
the
commercial
stream
of
commerce
that
you'd
make
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can't
store
cement
for
very
long
after
you've
processed
it,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
history
you've
outlined
about
the
financial
failures
of
the
private
enterprise
cement
plants
indicates
that
for
some
reason
or
other,
it's
--
it's
not
a
very
profitable
business.
now,
is
it
possible
that
the
state
taxpayers
of
south
dakota
are
to
some
degree,
already
subsidizing
the
present
plant
and
if
they
do
subsidize
a
plant
with
tax
revenues,
which
obviously
they
did
to
launch
it,
can't
they
favor
the
people
who
have
taken
the
financial
risk
independent
of
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
had
to
subsidize
it
to
build
it
in
the
first
place
didn't
they?
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
assume
it
was
built
with
taxpayers'
money,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
and
does
the
record
show
whether
it
makes
a
profit
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
plant
pay
taxes
to
the
state
of
south
dakota
for
its
operations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
pay
--
does
it
--
they
have
all
the
incidents
of
the
--
the
private
plants
that
went
broke,
income
taxes,
real
estate
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
profits
now,
taxes.do
they
tax
the
income,
do
they
tax
the
real
estate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
that's
why
they
--
they
can
produce
cement
to
--
cheaply
enough
to
induce
the
people
of
wyoming
to
come
over
to
south
dakota
to
buy
it
rather
than
making
it
themselves.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
going
to
--
it's
just
a
matter
of
simple
economics.
if
--
if
wyoming
could
make
it
as
cheaply
or
cheaper
wouldn't
--
wyoming
do
just
what
south
dakota
does
or
private
enterprisers
in
wyoming
set
up
plants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
no
cement
plants
in
wyoming?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
the
legislature
of
south
dakota
couldn't
pass
a
--
via
south
dakota
sort
of
a
program
requiring
all
state
purchases
to
be
made
from
the
state
if
they
were
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
--
you
answered
some
questions
of
both
mine
and
mr.
justice
stevens
about
once
entering
the
stream
of
commerce,
then
they
took
on
all
the
burdens.
now,
go
back
to
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you
that
south
dakota
set
up
a
cement
plant
which
would
be
exclusively
to
supply
the
contractors
who
were
building
south
dakota
roads
and
you
--
i
understood
your
response
to
that
earlier
was
that
that
would
be
alright.
but
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
not
that
cement
operation
--
has
not
that
cement
gone
into
stream
of
commerce
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
sell
to
the
contractors
who
are
building
south
dakota
roads,
because
some
of
them
might
be
contractors
from
north
dakota,
minnesota,
wyoming
and
nebraska?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we
have
then
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
from
your
point
of
view,
i
need
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
south
dakota
could
not
confine
under
the
commerce
clause,
could
not
confine
itself
to
those
south
dakota
public
works
projects.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
governor
janklow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
what
is
the
investment
of
the
people
of
south
dakota
in
the
cement
plant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
--
i
suppose
that's
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
over
what
period
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
income
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
pay
income
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
many
of
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
any
event,
there
--
the
--
the
plant,
the
operation
is
at
risk
of
losing
or
making
just
the
way
chrysler
corporation
has
been.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
usually
local
governments,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
--
you
were
in
the
rural
credits
business?
did
you
lend
on
farms
outside
of
south
dakota?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
lend
on
farms
outside?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
was
before
you
built
the
new
facility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
governor,
in
--
in
calling
for
bids,
you
--
you
could
provide,
i
assume,
that
the
successful
bidders
would
be
permitted
to
buy
south
dakota
materials.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
by
agreement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
by
agreement,
that
could
be
accomplished
that
the
--
the
successful
bidder
would
be
able
to
get
his
cement
in
south
dakota
from
this
plant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
part
of
the
governmental
reasons
would
be
that
the
taxpayers
of
south
dakota,
i
take
it,
this
is
one
factor
for
you,
have
invested
$40
million
and
they
--
they
might
turn
out
like
chrysler
corporation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
governor,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
a
minnesota
contractor
who
came
out
there
and
was
the
low
bidder
on
a
road
contract
and
set
up
an
office
and
ordered
some
cement,
will
he
be
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
south
dakota
customer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
practical
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
come
back
to
what
we
talked
about
a
little
bit
this
morning
or
someone
did.
with
cement
running
out
of
your
brief
case
now
literally,
is
there
a
case
here
since
it's
only
a
tro,
no
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
but
this
is
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
kind
of
thing
that
we
would
evade
review.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
of
some
long-lasting
period.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
else
it's
a
customer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kirven,
you
may
have
heard
the
question
i
just
put
to
the
governor.
this
being
only
a
tro,
and
in
light
of
the
subsequent
discussion,
do
you
think
we
still
have
a
case
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
--
that
--
that
alone
is
not
enough
reason
to
keep
the
case
alive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
always
costs
money,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
customer.
customer
is
the
word
as
well
as
contractor,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
--
there
would
seem
to
be
some
very
practical
ways
that
--
that
that
could
be
met
by
setting
up
an
office
in
rapid
city
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
with
a
telephone
operator
apparently.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
gomez
against
toledo.
