justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kirven,
are
there
--
is
there
any
north
rather
south
dakota
law
or
constitutional
provision
which
would
prevent
a
private
cement
plant
from
operating
in
south
dakota?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
in
--
in
effect,
you
have
the
state-owned
one,
but
you
could
also
have
a
private
one
in
competition
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so
far
as
you
know,
there's
no
statutory
prohibition
against
another
private
plant
making
another
effort
even
though
it
might
be
unsuccessful.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
hughes
was
a
state
regulation
that
applied
to
everybody
within
the
state,
private
or
public.
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here,
as
i
understood
your
earlier
answer
to
my
question.
there
--
there's
no
--
no
statutory
prohibition
against
a
private
corporation
going
into
the
cement
manufacture
business
in
south
dakota
and
competing
with
the
state-owned
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
--
i
thought
you
said
at
least
by
a
statute
or
regulation.
they
had
no
prohibition
against
anybody
else
going
into
the
cement
business.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
distinguish
then
between
as
a
policy
of
a
state
producing
--
company
like
this
that
sold
only
to
state-owned
entities
which
you
would
say
is
alright.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
policy
of
a
state-owned
entity
like
this,
which
sold
only
to
persons
or
entities
residing
within
the
state
which
you
say
is
bad.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
had
been
a
municipal
utility
in
south
dakota
that
had
extended
service
into
wyoming
at
a
certain
time
and
then
found
its,
say
it
was
supplied
the
hydraulic
power
and
--
of
a
short
season,
bad
season
and
it
had
to
--
it
simply
didn't
have
the
generating
capacity
anymore.
would
it
be
permitted
under
your
view
of
interstate
commerce
clause
to
cut
back
its
services
to
only
south
dakota
municipalities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
if
--
what
if
there
were
some
lines
going
to
south
dakota
communities
that
were
longer
than
lines
going
to
near
wyoming
communities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
--
the
hydroelectric
generating
plant
nonetheless
said,
“we're
going
to
serve
first
to
south
dakota
demand.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
i
might
be
so
bold
to
suggest.
i
think
minnesota
is
also
in
a
municipal
power
business.
in
many
parts
of
the
state,
there's
been
competition
between
public
and
private
power
sources,
has
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
could
--
he
could
nonetheless,
bid
on
a
south
dakota
road
project
and
if
his
bid
were
a
low
bid,
it
would
be
accepted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
original
reason
for
constructing
the
south
dakota
cement
plant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
there
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
going
to
be
cement
available
in
south
dakota,
it
had
to
be
supplied
by
the
government,
by
this
government-operated
plant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
conceivably,
the
plant
could
have
supplied
cement
and
nonetheless,
supplied
it
at
a
loss
to
these
citizens
of
south
dakota.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
governor,
let
--
let
me
ask
you
this
question
because
i
--
i
would
have
read
the
appendix
24
differently
than
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
suggest,
where
it
says,
“the
commission
expressed
its
desire
that
south
dakota
customers
and
south
dakota
contracts
be
given
preference.”
now,
supposing
that
peter
kiewit
which
when
i
was
i
practicing,
was
located
in
omaha,
came
up
and
bid
on
a
south
--
on
a
facility
to
be
erected
in
south
dakota,
would
that
be
a
south
dakota
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question,
governor.
are
there
--
are
there
quarry
lands
available
in
private
hands
in
south
dakota,
does
the
record
show?
or
does
the
state
condemn
and
purchase
up
all
of
the
quarry
lands
from
which
cement
material
is
obtained?
