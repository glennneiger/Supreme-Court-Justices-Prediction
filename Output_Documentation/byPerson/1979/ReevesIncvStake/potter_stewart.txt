if
the
plant
were
owned
not
by
the
state,
but
by
a
private
company,
could
that
private
company
decide
to
break
off
all
its
sales
to
out-of-state
residents
and
sell

--
sell
only
in

in
--
within
the
state
of
south
dakota?
justice

stewart
clearly
could,
couldn't
it?
justice

i
see.
justice

well,

now,
wait

as
a
single
--
a
single
defendant
here,
you
don't
have
any
possibility
of
a
conspiracy
or
in
agreement
with
anybody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
private
cement
company
clearly
could
do
this,
couldn't
it,
under
the
established
law?
justice

stewart
you
don't
have
an
agreement,
own
any
possibility
of

and
you
don't
have
a

here,
do
you?
justice

stewart
well,
if
you
had
a
private

how

you
have
a

justice

a
private

it
might
be
a
conspiracy
among
their
directors
and

not
to
sell
to
you
but
that
--
that's
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
when
you
say
therefore,
that
state
ownership
doesn't
immunize
this
from
the
antitrust
law,
you're
implying
that
--
that
a
private
cement
mill
would
be
violating
the
--
the
antitrust
law
if
it
did
this.
it
wouldn't
at
all,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
an
individual
cement
mill,
wouldn't
at
all,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
could
there
be
a
conspiracy
with
only
one
seller?
