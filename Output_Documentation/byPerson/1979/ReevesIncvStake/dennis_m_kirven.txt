mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
reeves,
inc.,
plaintiff,
in
the
action
below
and
petitioner
before
this
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
of
a
state
policy
favoring
its
own
citizens
over
citizens
of
other
states
in
a
sale
of
products
owned
and
manufactured
by
that
state.
the
petitioner
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
eighth
circuit
which
held
that
this
preferential
state
policy
did
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
the
state
of
south
dakota
owns
and
operates
a
cement
plant
in
rapid
city,
south
dakota,
which
manufactures,
sells
and
distributes
cement.
this
cement
plant
was
authorized
by
the
citizens
of
south
dakota
by
constitutional
amendment
in
1918.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
do
not
know
of
any
law
which
would
prevent
private
cement
plant
from
operating
in
south
dakota.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
there
could
be
a
private
manufacturer.
in
1920,
the
--
there
is
published
a
1920
report
of
the
south
dakota
cement
commission,
published
document,
which
was
the
study
made
at
that
time
concerning
the
availability
of
cement
and
the
feasibility
of
building
a
cement
plant
in
south
dakota.
and
that
report
indicates
that
there'd
been
two
attempts
by
private
industry
to
build
a
cement
plant
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.
that's
just
--
and
that
they
had
both
failed.
and
the
one
plant
was
--
was
built
and
the
--
the
report
is
not
clear,
but
it
indicated
that
it
ran
out
of
funds
and
closed
its
doors.
there
was
cement
being
supplied
to
the
state
of
south
dakota
by
a
manufacturer
located
out
of
the
state
at
that
time.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
none
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
don't
think
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
in
the
case
where
the
cement
plant
wasn't
exclusively
in-state
process
for
the
state
itself
and
not
for
the
state
citizens,
but
for
the
public
roads
that
are
required
to
the
state
normally
supplies
though
as
a
governmental
service,
then
that
would
not
be
--
they
were
no
be
--
no
requirement
that
a
resident
who
comes
from,
say
the
state
of
wyoming,
would
have
a
right
to
purchase
any
cement
or
be
treated
in
the
marketplace
as
any
other
competitor,
because
the
state
really
has
never
placed
the
cement
in
the
interstate
commerce
at
that
point.
it's
not
involved
as
a
participant
in
the
market
as
they
are
today,
because
they
participate
in
the
marketplace,
they
solicit
sales
in
a
sevens,
eight-state
area.
in
1977,
48%
of
the
shipments
of
this
plant
went
outside
of
the
state.
now,
reeves
can
say,
wyoming
corporation,
it
has
purchased
cement
from
the
south
dakota
cement
commission
for
a
period
of
over
20
years
and
during
that
period
of
time,
it
has
received
salesmen
who
have
asked
for
about
the
needs
of
the
cement
plant
and
orders
have
been
placed
and
the
cement
has
been
either
picked
up
by
reeves
itself
or
delivered
to
the
cement
plant
by
trucks
from
the
plant
or
hired
by
the
company.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
no,
there's
no
--
there
was
no
longterm
contract.
there
is
no
written
contract
period.
the
customary
course
of
dealing
with
ready-mix
dealers
is
to
make
sales
purchases
over
the
phone,
orders
over
the
phone,
based
primarily
for
the
reason
that
they
have
no
storage
capacities.
most
ready-mix
don't
have
the
type
of
storage
facilities
that
could
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
it
requires
special
silos
which
most
ready-mix
--
small
ready-mix
dealers
would
not
have.
so,
their
needs
are
more
or
less,
met
on
a
--
as
their
demand
comes
in
for
concrete,
they
order
more
cements.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
are
subsidizing
this
time.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
they
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
was.
it
was
built
on
the
sale
of
bonds
by
the
state
and
there
was
an
assessment
against
the
citizens
for
--
to
pay
off
the
bonds.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
the
record
does
not
show
that.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it
or
not.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
don't
think
it
does
particularly
after
hughes
v.
oklahoma,
your
honor,
which
dealt
of
course,
with
the
minnows
in
oklahoma,
in
which
it
expressly
overruled
geer
v.
connecticut
which
was
concerned,
the
--
the
killing
of
--
of
wild
game
in
connecticut
in
a
transportation
of
that
game
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
applied
and
restricted
the
transportation
of
minnows
and
--
of
natural
minnows
in-state
and
harvested
from
state
waters
for
resale
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
no,
there's
not.
but
the
--
the
issue
is
whether
or
not,
a
consumer
can
go
to
any
marketplace
in
the
united
states
and
be
free
from
being
--
then
--
the
exploitation
of
that
person,
because
it
happens
to
go
into
the
state
of
south
dakota
being
a
cement
market.
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
enjoyed
all
of
the
benefits
of
interstate
commerce
and
not
only
have
as
this
plant
been
subsidized
by
tax
dollars
of
the
citizens
of
south
dakota,
it
has
been
subsidized
by
people
who
buy
cement
from
the
plant.
that's
their
other
source
of
revenue
with
48%
of
the
cement
going
out
of
the
state,
other
people
have
paid
and
made
payments
to
the
plant
over
the
course
of
dealings
with
that
plant
which
have
resulted
to
in
its
continued
success.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
pays
the
profit
over
and
i
think
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
pays
the
profit
over
that
it
does
make
to
the
state
treasury,
but
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
no,
it
doesn't.
it
has
--
it
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
has
the
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
don't
--
did
not
believe
they
--
they
tax
income
and
i
believe
that
the
real
estate
is
--
is
not
taxed.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
wouldn't
know
the
answer
to
that
whether
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
i
feel
that's
certainly
a
possibility
if
--
if
it
reaches
a
point
where
we
have
a
scarcity
of
resources
whether
it
be
a
cement
on
any
other
place
where
a
state
through
its
police
powers
and
its
ability
to
exempt
certain
operations
from,
say
paying
taxes
or
using
its
power
of
eminent
domain
to
acquire
a
business
which
deals
on
a
natural
resource
and
feels
that
it
could
in
fact
operate
the
plant
with
less
--
at
a
less
competitive
price
than
is
available
either
by
a
private
industry
or
--
or
another,
that
barriers
between
interstate
commerce
are
going
to
be
set
up
when
preferences
are
then
granted
to
these
particular
states
and
that's
what
creates
the
trade
barrier.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
there
is
one
cement
plant
in
wyoming,
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state.
it
does
not
serve
area
where
my
client
is.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
the
cement
plant
is
in
laramie,
wyoming.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
is
operating.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
produces
this
is
out
just
nine
--
well,
maybe
in
the
record,
maybe
in
the
affidavit
of
the
secretary
of
the
cement
commission.
it
produces
approximately
i
think
200,000
tons
of
cement.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
do
not
know.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
most
of
those
raw
materials
are
located
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.
its
--
its
fuel,
coal
comes
from
wyoming
and
natural
gas
comes
from
north
dakota.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
limestone
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
--
is
quarried
right
at
the
mine
site
in
rapid
city,
as
i
understand.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
do
not
know.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
on
july
of
1978,
when
the
cement
plant
in
--
experienced
a
shortage
that
we
were
discussing
here
today
and
they
were
bringing
on
line
a
new
production
expansion
facility,
which
would
almost
double
its
production.
so,
they
had
problems
with
production
at
that
time
and
that
would
have
doubled
the
capacity
as
i
understand
it
of
the
plant
before
1978.
the
new
facility
will
actually
double
its
production
which
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
only
if
--
if
the
state
was
actually
using
the
cement
for
its
own
--
own
uses
and
not
selling
it
to
its
citizens.
i
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
right.
i
would
have
no
objection.
it's
just
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
and
once
it's
sold
to
a
--
to
a
citizen
in
a
--
in
a
nongovernmental
type
of
activity
where
it
makes
a
sale
for
its
citizen.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
only
if
they
--
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
unless
they
pass
the
balancing
test
this
court
has
traditionally
employed
to
determine
whether
its
--
only
has
an
incidental
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
if
that
regulation
has
a
significant
burden
on
interstate
commerce
which
i
--
and
if
that
were
showing,
i
do
not
believe
it
promotes
any
legitimate
local
interest
which
this
court
has
previously
recognized
because
the
purpose
of
that,
assuming
it
would
be
for
the
economic
gain
of
the
citizens
of
south
dakota.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
--
in
american
--
i
think
it's
american
printing
and
--
versus
askew
case,
the
florida
case.
the
--
there
was
a
summary
affirmance
of
that
statute,
but
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
would
say
that
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap
is
closer
than
hughes
v.
oklahoma
case.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
hughes
v.
oklahoma?
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap?
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
i
would
distinguish
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap.
i
do
not
believe
that
alexandria
scrap
can
be
extended
to
include
a
preferential
policy
by
a
state
which
is
engaged
in
a
--
a
nongovernmental
service
or
in
this
case,
a
--
an
actual
regulation
of
commerce.
the
state
of
south
dakota
claims
immunity
under
alexandria
scarp
saying
that
their
conduct
was
similar
to
that
of
--
of
maryland
in
the
alexandria
scrap
case
and
just
simply
participating
in
the
marketplace,
but
i
submit
to
this
court
that
much
more
than
being
a
participant,
they
became
a
regulator
of
interstate
commerce
when
they
adopted
the
policy.
only
by
regulating
interstate
commerce
could
they
accomplish
the
purpose
of
providing
their
residents
with
a
--
a
preference.
it
wasn't
a
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
not
going
into
the
cement
business.
but
this
policy,
this
preferential
policy
of
who
could
buy
from
the
cement
plant
affects
my
client
because
no
cement
was
available
for
him
to
buy.
it
was
taken
up
by
south
dakota
residents.
the
south
dakota
cement
commission
eliminated
competition
for
its
cement
from
residents
in
the
six-state
area.
and
that's
how
they
were
able
to
supply
the
--
their
residents
with
cement.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
the
--
the
options
that
south
dakota
had
at
that
time
for
an
even
handed
treatment
of
not
only
its
own
citizens,
but
the
consumers
and
customers
who
had
--
had
traded
with
previously,
was
the
50%
allocation
policy
which
gave
all
persons
the
right
or
the
allocation
of
cement
based
on
a
previous
three
years
average
of
the
previous
three
years
cement
purchases.
and
that
would've
been
perfectly
acceptable
to
reeves
to
be
able
to
receive
that
kind
of
allocation
because
it
did
not
discriminate
against
inter-commerce.
and
the
--
the
classifications
of
south
dakota
is
being
either
a
participant
in
the
marketplace
or
even
being
in
a
proprietary
rather
than
a
governmental
nature
or
activity,
does
not
preclude
that
state
from
regulating
the
market.
because
in
this
case
with
the
large
segment
of
the
market
in
that
area
being
handled
by
south
dakota,
it
could
in
effect,
regulate
interstate
commerce.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
if
the
decision
was
based
on
a
rule
of
reason
or
a
good
business
decision.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
anyone
can
object
to
business
withdrawing
from
certain
market
areas.
the
--
the
position
is
that
this
was
not
--
our
position
is
this
is
not
a
marketing
decision.
if
a
hydroelectric
company
because
of
its
facilities
must
in
fact
cut
back
and
it's
a
reasonable
business
decision.
it's
not
based
on
the
fact
that
it's
where
you
live,
but
it's
where
the
distribution
lines
are.
it's
not
that
you're
a
resident
of
the
state
of
wyoming,
but
that
the
distribution
lines
or
the
capacity
just
isn't
sufficient
to
supply
that
electricity
to
wyoming,
then
in
those
cases
if
it's
a
logical
business
reason,
there
is
no
violation
because
there's
really
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that's
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
that's
an
impermissible
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
it's
a
disguise
of
a
form
of
creating
a
benefit
to
its
own
citizens
which
if
it
was
a
substantial
burden,
couldn't
be
overcome.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
your
honor,
i
understood
your
first
question
as
being
directly
used
by
state
employees
themselves
and
i
didn't
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
--
didn't
understand
the
contractors
being
in
your
first
question.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
okay.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
with
the
contractors
in
the
first
question,
i
believe
that
if
they
supply
a
contractor
who
is
doing
a
--
a
job
for
a
public
hospital
or
a
public
road
or
any
other
public
facility,
that
is
interstate
commerce.
because
in
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
submit
that
it
cannot,
unless
it
builds
the
hospital
itself
and
it
uses
the
cement
itself.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
this
--
the
distinction
of
being
a
participant
in
the
marketplace
in
that
case,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
state
was
attempting
to
accomplish
a
governmental
function
of
keeping
a
clearing
--
clean
environment.
here,
the
purpose
and
policy
of
south
dakota
is
not
what
has
been
traditionally
defined
as
a
governmental
function,
but
is
one
which
seeks
to
gain
economic
opportunity
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
south
dakota.
that's
clear
in
the
eakin
versus
south
dakota
cement
commission
case,
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs,
as
the
state
case
involving
the
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
and
also,
private
enterprise
in
maryland
as
i
understand
it
was
in
business
in
scrap
processing
market,
but
they
were
not
effectively
taking
care
of
the
junk
cars
for
--
to
--
to
keep
a
clean
environment.
and
so
the
state
has
stepped
in
and
--
and
taken
over
that
aspect
to
the
extent
that
it
does
now
clean
up
the
environment,
presume
it
has
some
effect
on
cleaning
the
environment.
though
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does,
because
it's
difficult
to
resolve
the
differences
between
purchasing
just
like
the
--
the
--
there
--
it
seems
to
me
that
a
state
needs
certain
purchases
to
operate.
it
needs
pencils.
it
needs
paper.
it
needs
gasoline.
there
is
a
difference
between
a
state
buying
those
materials
which
it
needs
and
saying,
“well,
we're
going
to
buy
all
the
pencils
for
all
the
citizens
of
the
state.”
that
i
see
is
a
distinction
between
it
to
purchase.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
question
--
the
--
the
policy
being
enforced
at
any
time
is
--
and
that
south
dakota
declares
there
is
a
shortage,
it
has
an
immediate
effect
on
my
client.
in
that
effect,
any
period
of
time
which
it
takes
to
have
that
matter
resolved
is
going
to
cause
my
client
money.
and
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
there's
no
assurance
that
the
policy
won't
be
enforced
against
reeves
in
the
policy
again
as
soon
as
a
shortage
occurs.
in
fact,
in
may
of
1979,
the
policy
was
enforced
against
reeves.
and
reeves
received
an
allocation
formula
based
on
expected
needs
of
south
dakota
being
met
first
and
then
reeves
received
an
allocation
in
may
of
1979,
your
honor,
after
1978
when
the
shortage
occurred.
so
it's
obvious
that
they
intend,
in
all
probability
will,
have
or
enforce
the
policy
the
next
time
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
at
the
present
time,
yes,
your
honor.
but
if
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
i
would
assume
that
during
the
summer
of
this
year
with
the
economic
condition
in
the
housing
industry
and
with
the
demand
being
less
that
there
will
be
no
problem
this
year.
but
the
problem
arises
is
--
is
in
wyoming
with
the
short
construction
season,
the
critical
point
for
my
client.
in
that
period
of
time,
if
that
policy
is
enforced
again,
the
--
even
the
time
that
was
lost
in
this
suit
which
was
only
19
or
21
days
or
actually
it's
about
30
days,
that
my
client,
it's
--
the
harm
is
tremendous.
it's
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
construction
season
for
the
ready
mix
concrete
begins
about
june
and
goes
through
october
for
my
client.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
it
competes
with
south
dakota
ready
mix
dealers
in
gillette,
wyoming,
at
their
plant.
and
that
is
really
the
essence
of
our
claim
as
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
--
without
south
dakota
cement,
we
cannot
compete
in
the
gillette
market
with
south
dakota
ready
mix
dealers.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
we
cannot
go
into
the
state
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
right.
and
it's
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
it
says
south
dakota
customer
but
we
apparently
do
not
fit
that
definition.
i
think
that
implies
that
you're
a
south
dakota
resident
as
used
in
that
policy.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
[laughs]
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
it's
--
it's
--
the
comparison
between
other
types
of
activities
like
electricity
in
nebraska
is
not
the
same
because
you
cannot
drive
to
nebraska
and
say,
“give
me
a
bottle
of
electricity,
i
live
in
wyoming,
i
want
to
take
it
with
me.”
that's
all
we're
asking
for.
that
involves
a
different
type
of
an
activity.
we
are
not
saying
to
this
court
that
south
dakota
is
forced
to
enter
into
any
market
areas.
that
they
are
forced
to
sell
in
anyone
state
as
to
--
that
they
must
put
distribution
lines
or
open
up.
all
we're
saying
is
that
reeves
inc.
has
a
right
to
go
to
any
state
in
this
national
market
place
and
be
treated
the
same
manner
under
the
commerce
clause
without
any
barriers
imposed.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
as
south
dakota
customers.
and
it
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
our
position
is
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that
state
ownership
of
this
product
does
not
make
it
immune
from
the
implications
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
in
this
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
wouldn't
have
any
case.
i
don't
--
the
--
the
assumption
that
private
enterprise
would
be
able
to
do
this
carries
only
so
long
as
they
do
it
absent
anticompetitive
motives
because
that
private
enterprise
is
covered
by
sherman
antitrust
act.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
unless
it's
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
absent
anticompetitive
motives
and
--
and
assuming
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
i
don't
know
if
there
hasn't
been
a
conspiracy
among
the
citizens
in
south
dakota
and
its
state
to
keep
this
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
that's
true.
my
only
statement
was
that
--
is
--
if
--
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
which
i
don't
know
that
that
there
isn't
a
conspiracy
with
the
citizens,
this
--
the
governor
went
into
state
court
representing
not
only
the
state
but
the
south
dakota
general
contractors
of
that
state
to
have
the
50%
allocation
policy
enjoined.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
not
under
the
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
--
the
specific
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
if
it
--
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
of
some
kind,
it
would.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
if
they
conspired
--
if
a
private
cement
mill
in
south
dakota
conspired
to
sell
with
all
the
citizens
of
south
dakota
to
them
exclusively,
i
think
there
might
be
a
violation
with
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
well,
that's
true
then.
it
--
it
did
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
kirven
that's
correct.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
