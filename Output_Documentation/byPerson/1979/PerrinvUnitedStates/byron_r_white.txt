is
that
a
direct
pomponio
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
your
strongest
legislative
history
the
passage
you
quoted
from
senator
keating?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
--
you're
suggesting
that
that
would
be
an
example
--
the
sports
would
be
an
example
of
commercial
bribery?
justice

white
unofficial
bribery.

but
you're
--
you're
just
saying
whatever
is
--
the
solicitor
general
meant
to
give
that
opinion,
he
was
wrong
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
your
argument
was
in
that
case
and
as
i
get
it
from
reading
the
opinion
that
if
you
construed
the
extortion
--
the
extortion
statute
the
way
it
was
urged
by
the
--
by
the
defendant
in
that
case,
that
it
--
the
--
the
two
statutes
would
be
--
one
of
them
would
be
superfluous
--
justice

white
--
into
bribery
or
like
extortions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
when
he
said
that
that
you
have
to
construe
it,
the
extortion
statute,
probably
to
keep
it
--
to
keep
that
--
it
from
being
superfluous
to
the
--
the
bribe
--
bribery
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you're
just
suggesting
that
argument,
looking
at
it
now
wouldn't
--
isn't
--
wasn't
a
very
good
one?
