justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
legislative
history,
is
there
any
reference
to
labor
racketeering
and
bribery
of
labor
officials
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boudin
in
--
a
clear
differentiation
not
within
this,
the
complex
of
state
statutes
and
which
side
of
the
line
would
a
statute
prohibiting
the
bribery
of
an
--
professional
athlete
fall?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
the
bribery
or
--
or
regular
bribery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
footnote
because
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
whole
thing.
what
was
the
purpose
of
point
--
of
the
government
pointing
out
in
the
nardello
brief
and
in
this
footnote
that
bribery
was
traditionally,
narrowly
limited
to
public
officials
unless
it
was
the
government's
view
that
bribery
was
so
limited
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
there
wasn't
a
--
wouldn't
have
been
a
fair
reading
of
the
brief
to
interpret
as
indicating
that
solicitor
general
thought
that
the
term
bribery
in
the
statute
was
also
limited
to
--
to
its
traditional
meaning.
otherwise,
i
don't
understand
why
he
would've
made
the
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
really
mean
it's
open
ended.
you
just
mean
it's
a
broad
category
that's
not
coextensive
with
any
group
--
any
state
statute.
but,
don't
you
--
don't
you
accept
the
proposition
and
whatever
the
contours
of
the
--
of
the
federal
--
of
the
concept
of
bribery
in
the
travel
act
they
remain
constant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
same
i
suppose
that
to
the
first
time
a
state
--
state
adopted
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
bribe
a
judge.
they
never
had
a
judge-bribing
statute
before
they
could
adopt
one
in
1999
and
they
then
come
within
the
travel
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
believe
as
you
read
that,
that's
consistent
with
the
bribery
definition
being
either
broad
or
narrow
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
included
public
officials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
their
argument
only
required
it
to
include
not
to
be
limited
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
they're
--
they're
objecting
to
the
claim
that
the
extortion
is
limited
to
public
officials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
the
case
it's
--
it's
overlap.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
can
read
it,
yes.
