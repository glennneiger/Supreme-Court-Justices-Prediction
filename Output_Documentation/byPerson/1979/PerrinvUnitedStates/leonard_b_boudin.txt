mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
one
of
statutory
construction
with
constitutional
implications
is
whether
congress
in
using
the
term
"bribery"
in
18
u.s.c.
1952,
the
travel
act,
intended
to
refer
to
bribery
of
public
officials
as
used
in
the
common
law
or
rather
included
the
term
"commercial
bribery"
and
that
which
is
involved
solely
in
this
case.
the
travel
act,
this
court
will
recall,
insofar
as
relevant
here
makes
it
a
crime,
a
felony
punishable
by
$5000
or
five
years
in
prison,
$10,000
to
use
interstate
commerce
including
the
mails
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
an
unlawful
activity
and
one
of
the
unlawful
activities
described
here
is
bribery.
the
facts
not
between
before
this
court,
due
to
the
limited
certiorari,
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
say
that
the
petitioner
is
a
private
consulting
geologist
who
was
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
charged
with
participating
in
the
bribery
of
a
private
employee
of
a
private
concern
and
that
there
appear
to
be
two
telephone
calls
and
one
interstate
shipment
of
non-incriminating
data
involved
in
this
case.
now,
in
construing
the
statute
and
it's
the
most
interesting
problem
of
statutory
construction,
we
have
here,
the
problem
is
to
determine
what
congress
and
only
congress
intended
in
the
bribery
act,
not
to
determine
what
a
state
intended
or
as
nardello
to
which
i
will
refer
later,
points
out
with
a
state
label
was.
what
did
congress
intend?
in
considering
the
intent
of
congress,
we
have
the
familiar
but
controlling
and
important
canons
of
construction
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
the
first,
of
course,
is
whether
the
term
"bribery"
has
plain
meaning
and
i
must
say
that
the
government's
arguments
in
bribery
is
not
to
be
considered
as
common
law
formulation
but
it
would
to
be
determined
by
the
oxford
dictionary
or
webster's,
does
not
seem
persuasive
particularly
if
one
realizes
that
if
one
pertains
to
the
legal
dictionaries
like
bouvier
or
black,
one
finds
that
they
use
the
term
bribery
including
the
most
recent
addition
of
black
in
the
technical
common
law
sense.
just
to
take
one
example
of
black,
i'll
just
read
the
first
few
lines,
"the
offering,
giving,
receiving
or
soliciting
of
anything
of
value
to
influence
action
as
official
or
in
discharge
of
legal
or
public
duty."
in
contrasting
these
two
definitions,
one
has
to
remember
mr.
justice
holmes'
statement
which
i
read
recently
in
--
in
justice
frankfurter's
cardozo
lectures
30
years
ago
that
congress
is
presumed
to
have
intended
to
use
familiar,
legal
expressions
in
their
familiar
legal
sense.
so,
i
would
say
that
on
balance,
we'd
probably
come
out
better
in
our
construction,
but
let
us
turn
to
the
legislative
history.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
the
rewis
case,
it
is
a
very
meager
or
limited
legislative
history.
the
hearings
clearly
indicate
as
nardello
says
and
rewis
says
that
this
was
an
attempt
by
attorney
general
kennedy
to
give
a
package
of
organized
crime
legislation
to
the
congress.
and
there
are
statements
made
particularly
in
the
course
of
the
testimony
before
the
committee
by
attorney
general
kennedy
himself
and
in
a
supplementary
letter
to
congressman
sellar
signed
by
deputy
attorney
general,
now
mr.
justice
white,
indicating
that
this
was
an
organized
crime
statute
and
that
shakedowns
were
used
by
organized
crime.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
and
no
claim
by
attorney
general
kennedy
or
by
his
assistant
mr.
miller
of
the
criminal
division,
that
organized
crime
ever
used
commercial
bribery.
and
what
there
is
in
this
record
are
two
or
three
very
interesting
statements
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
of
attorney
general
kennedy
in
which
the
subject
of
bribery,
the
only
times
when
it
is
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
senate
and
house
hearings
is
always
with
reference
to
the
bribery
of
government
officials.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
they
have
any
help
or
hindrance.
they
are
merely
statements
that
we
--
federal
code
doesn't
include
common
law
crimes
but
they
are
not
a
reason
why
congress
does
not
turn
to
the
common
law
definition
and
while
the
courts
don't
look
to
a
common
law
definitions
to
determine
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
i
think
actually,
that
was
done
to
some
extent
in
--
in
the
dunn
case
but
i
will
come
to
that,
your
honor.
as
i
say
â€“
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that
the
government's
--
that
the
government
in
its
brief
made
reference
to
some
problems
of
labor
corruption
but
the
court
will
note,
which
i
have
regrettably
not
noted
in
my
reply
brief,
that
that
referred
to
a
different
bill,
a
different
bill
dealing
with
immunity
which
was
before
the
congress
and
which
referred
to
labor
and
the
taft-hartley
law.
it
never
--
there
was
never
any
reference
in
discussing
this
bill
to
labor
racketeering.
i
hope
the
court
will
read
that
record
to
see
that
i
am
correct.
now,
the
government
says
by
referring
to
current
books
that
labor
unions
are
--
labor
--
sorry,
that
organized
crime
now
does
use
commercial
bribery.
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
take
a
book
written
in
1972
or
1973
and
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
this
congress
in
1961
and
these
committees
were
considering
a
subject
they
discussed,
namely
the
use
of
commercial
bribery
by
organized
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
yes.
well,
i
think
that
i
must
say
that
the
word
"bribery"
here
--
i
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
word
"bribery"
has
an
absolutely
clear
meaning
and
should
be
considered
in
its
common
law
definition.
but
as
i
balance
the
dictionaries
and
as
i
realize
the
history
of
bribery
for
so
many
years
and
the
use
in
--
in
the
penal
codes
and
the
use
by
draftsman
to
which
i
will
refer
in
a
few
minutes,
you
see
that
bribery
has
a
very
special
limited
official
connotation.
one
for
example,
were
to
look
at
the
federal
criminal
code
as
it
existed
in
1961,
one
would
see
that
chapter
11
refers
to
bribery,
graft
and
conflicts
of
interests.
and
the
one
section
there
entitled
"bribery"
deals
with
section
201
with
the
bribery
of
government
officials.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
situation
is
absolutely
clear.
there
is
no
dispute
to
what
the
word
"bribery"
means,
but
candor
requires
that
we
assess
the
situation
and
say,
"yes,
this
term
as
used
in
the
statute
as
ambiguous
and
that's
why
we
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
to
the
other
canons
which
i
will
refer.
now,
just
to
continue
for
a
moment
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
legislative
history,
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
that
given
that
the
--
that
a
book
written
currently
or
even
a
book
written
earlier
which
was
not
before
the
committee
and
which
it
didn't
consider
is
very
persuasive
evidence
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"bribery"
and
i
prefer,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
words
of
judge
gurfein
who
wrote
the
brecht
opinion
on
which
we
rely
in
the
second
circuit
and
is
described
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
can
finish
the
phrase
later.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
reference
when
we
ended
to
judge
gurfein
in
the
brecht
case
had
in
mind
his
long
history
as
a
prosecutor
of
organized
crime
in
the
labor
racketeering
field
and
i
give
some
weight
as
against
some
of
these
books
that
are
mentioned
by
the
government
to
his
statement
that
organized
crime
does
not
usually
use
commercial
bribery
as
a
component
and
he
described
that
as
an
establishment
crime.
but
more
important
that
what
a
judge
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
in
brecht,
sir.
it's
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
in
the
brecht
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
was
not,
your
honor.
that
--
it
is
not.
but
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend
and
the
government
says
and
we
deny
that
organized
crime,
according
to
the
legislative
history,
use
commercial
bribery.
whereas
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
government
in
its
brief
in
--
in
nardello
and
view
expressed
by
--
adopted
by
this
court
in
footnote
11,
page
293
said,
"bribery
has
traditionally
focused
upon
corrupt
activities
by
public
officials."
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
next
principle
upon
which
i
rely,
it
is
that
of
the
common
law
definition
assumed
to
be
that
of
congress.
i
touched
on
it
an
answer
to
a
question
put
by
justice
rehnquist
and
i
want
to
leave
that
by
simply
referring
this
court
through
its
decisions
in
turley
and
in
morissette,
particularly
to
mr.
justice
jackson's
comment
in
morissette
that
when
congress
borrows
terms
of
art,
which
are
accumulated
legal
tradition
meaning
of
centuries,
it
normally
intends
to
adopt
those
views.
turning
next
to
the
federal
complex
of
statutes
and
state
statutes,
i
treat
them
briefly
because
all
they
are,
are
guide
posts
and
the
significant
aspect,
if
congress
looked
at
the
state
statutes
and
said,
"what
is
considered
bribery,"
significant
aspects
are
in
contrast
in
nardello
which
again
i
will
touch
on
more
fully,
there
was
a
clear
line
of
demarcation
between
the
state
statutes
dealing
with
bribery
and
called
bribery,
although
the
name
is
not
critical,
it's
the
line
of
demarcation
that's
important
and
the
state
statutes
dealing
with
commercial
bribery
of
various
variations.
and
this
line
of
demarcation
is
followed
by
the
codifiers
by
those
who
prepare
the
american
law
institute
people
who
prepared
the
penal
--
model
penal
codes
by
the
working
papers
of
the
brown
commission.
and
indeed,
by
the
very
legislation
now
pending
before
the
congress,
the
currently
new
code
--
new
criminal
code
in
which
a
distinction
is
recognized
as
it
is
in
the
textbooks
like
perkins
and
others
to
which
the
government
refers
between
crimes
against
sovereignty
and
crimes
against
property.
i
have
in
our
brief
delineated
the
examples
of
that.
now,
i
want
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
suppose
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
very
hard.
it
says
--
it
says
out
of
sport,
if
i
may
use
the
expression.
it's
a
special
kind
of
situation
in
which
you
have
so
many
state
bribery
statutes
involving
sports.
if
i
have
to
categorize
them
i
would
say
it's
a
variety
of
commercial
bribery
or
perhaps
it
reflects
a
special
concern
of
the
american
legislators
and
people
for
that
particular
aspect
which
was
a
national
scandal,
i
think
at
about
1962
or
1963
after
the
statute.
so
even
reflects
it
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
real
question
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
the
statue
and
congress
did
not
have
in
mind.
i
may
say,
despite
senator
keating's
passing
observations
at
the
end
of
congressional
hearings
with
respect
to
a
sports
bribery
statute.
to
me,
the
critical
problem
which
we
face
here
before
the
court
is
that
on
which
the
government
takes
issue
with
us
and
that
is,
"what
is
the
meaning
of
nardello?"
i
already
said
what
the
court
said
in
nardello
with
respect
to
bribery,
but
why
did
the
court
decide
nardello
as
it
did.
it'll
be
very
strange
if
the
court
expanded
bribery
--
in
this
case,
if
this
court
expanded
bribery
in
this
case,
we'll
you
use
the
term
broadly,
i
don't
want
to
beg
the
question,
when
the
broad
definition
of
extortion
in
nardello
was
based
upon
the
government's
argument
in
nardello,
that
this
broad
definition
of
extortion
was
required
because
there
was
a
narrow
conception
of
bribery.
now,
taking
nardello
on
the
merits,
nardello
was
based
upon
a
legislative
history
in
which
attorney
general
kennedy
said,
"their
organized
crime
used
extortion."
it
was
based
upon
the
blending
by
legislation
and
judicial
decision
of
extortion
and
blackmail
unlike
our
line
of
demarcation
here.
it
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
as
the
government
pointed
out
so
well
in
its
nardello
brief
upon
which
most
of
my
knowledge
comes
here
that
extortion
by
legislators
alone
was
inconsistent,
where
the
statute
directed
an
extortion
by
organized
crime.
and
finally,
the
court
said,
"obviously,
we
defer
to
that,
take
note
i
have
no
problem
with
it,"
that
labels
of
blackmail
could
not
obscure
the
fact
that
nardello
was
engaged
in
extorsion
of
conduct
even
under
state
law.
now,
i
want
to
suggest
also
to
the
court
as
we
have
in
the
last
pages
of
our
brief
that
an
expansive
interpretation
of
the
term
"bribery"
would
--
under
rewis
and
many
other
decisions
of
the
court
all
too
sensitive
federal
state
relationships
by
transforming
minor
offences
into
federal
felonies
and
i
think
that
as
the
court
said
in
bass,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall
who
wrote
the
opinion
there.
"unless
congress
conveys
its
purpose
clearly,"
i'm
using
the
justice's
words,
"then
this
kind
of
restructuring
could
take
care
of
minor
crimes,
is
impermissible
and
indeed,
this
restructuring
is
as
rather
strange
thing
because
it's
an
anachronism
even
in
the
federal
system.
thus,
for
example
29
u.s.c
186
(a)
which
deals
with
gratuities
to
have
trade
union
officials
is
a
misdemeanor
and
section
215
of
18
u.s.c.
refers
to
gratuities
received
by
a
banking
official
as
a
misdemeanor.
this
statute
would
made
--
would
make
a
telephone
call
to
a
banking
official
or
from
him
where
a
telephone
call
by
a
labor
union
agent,
a
felony.
i
think
therefore
that
the
--
you
have
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
restructuring
the
--
of
the
federal
system
as
well
as
the
state.
now,
this
is
in
my
view,
if
i
may
suggest
it,
exactly
the
kind
of
case
with
which
this
court
dealt
in
discussing
the
principle
of
lenity.
it
is
a
case
where
in
the
words
of
bachelder
and
culbert,
words
do
not
plainly
impose
meaning.
we
don't
know
which
dictionary
definition
was
chosen
even
in
the
oxford
to
take
the
government's
example.
we
don't
know
whether
the
common
law
should
be
disregarded.
we
don't
know
whether
the
principle
of
(inaudible),
namely
that
you
can
still
--
penal
laws
narrowly
should
be
disregarded,
it
take
all
of
those
considerations
and
it
calls
here
for
a
principle
of
lenity
which
this
court,
i
think
in
the
dunn
case
pointed
out
has
a
constitutional
basis
in
ex
post
facto
principles
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
the
issue
of
notice
was
raised
in
the
court
below
at
page
190
to
192,
the
192
of
the
transcript.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
--
the
issue
of
the
--
yes,
the
constitutional
issue
of
notice,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
really
the
problem
here.
i
think
the
problem
here
is
the
construction
of
a
statute.
and
the
construction
of
a
statute,
whether
the
issue
had
been
raised
below
or
not,
call
for
the
principle
of
lenity,
particularly,
where
you
have
here
a
very
minor,
i
think
a
--
a
small
fish,
i'm
paraphrasing,
was
the
word
used
by
--
by
judge
rubin
dissenting
in
the
court
below
in
this
case.
i
would
also
urge
the
court
in
considering
this
problem
to
note
that
this
is
probably
the
third
case
in
18
years
involving
the
application
to
commercial
bribery
of
section
1252.
at
least,
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
and
of
course
we
know
in
brecht
--
in
brecht,
the
court
came
to
different
conclusion
so
we
are
left
here
with
a
pomponio
and
this
apparent
situation.
this
is
clearly
the
kind
of
a
case
where
we
cannot
say
it
was
said
in
--
in
scarborough,
that
there
is
a
clear
history.
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which
we
--
the
history
is
on
our
side
and
i
think
that
construction
of
the
word,
bearing
in
mind
its
long
history
is
on
our
side.
now,
to
conclude
at
least
for
the
moment,
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
what
it
is
asked
by
the
government
to
do.
it
is
asked
by
the
government
to
define
a
criminal
statute
which
is
at
best
ambiguous,
which
has
been
enforced
against
the
defendant
twice
or
group
of
defendants
twice
in
18
years.
it
has
asked
to
construe
it
differently
from
the
common
law,
broadly
rather
than
strictly,
although
it's
a
penal
statute,
under
a
definition
which
among
others
may
be
found
in
popular
dictionaries
or
even
learned
dictionaries
like
oxford
under
a
definition
which
is
contrary
to
that
of
all
legal
dictionary
that
i've
seen
which
when
they
use
the
term
commercial
bribery,
use
it
as
a
separate
heading.
it
has
asked
to
construe
it
contrary
to
legislative
history
of
which
there
is
very
little
of
whatever
is
on
our
side.
it
has
asked
to
construe
it
contrary
--
contrary
to
the
views
expressed
to
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
in
nardello
and
the
passage
to
which
i
referred
your
honors
in
the
original
briefs,
and
i
submit
my
very
high
regards
to
that
office.
and
i'm
sure
the
courts
of
course
leaves
it
to
conclude
that
the
solicitor
general
that
not
suggest
that
bribery
had
a
narrow
definition,
if
i
can
call
it
narrow,
limited
to
public
officials
for
strategic
reasons
in
nardello,
but
it
stated
its
view
in
nardello
with
reason
and
with
thoughtfulness
and
with
a
knowledge
of
legal
history.
i'll
reserve
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
i
your
honor?
i
should
like
to
read
to
the
court
the
government's
language
in
its
brief
in
nardello
at
page
9.
"furthermore,"
said
the
government,
"joined
in
the
same
clause
with
extortion,
is
an
offense
which
has
its
normal
focus,
the
corruption
of
public
officers
interstate
travel
to
promote
'bribery'"
is
also
forbidden.
in
this
context,
reading
extortion
as
confined
only
to
acceptance
of
unauthorized
fees
by
public
officials
would
render
the
extortion
branch
--
sorry,
would
render
--
would
render
the
extortion
branch
of
the
clause
practically
superfluous.
the
government
there
took
the
firm
position
that
where
corruption
is
involved,
it
had
to
have,
at
least
it
would
persuade
the
court
to
take
a
broad
definition
of
extortion
because
as
it
said,
the
corruption
of
public
officials
was
being
handled
by
the
bribery
provision.
this
not
a
quote
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
accept
the
--
it
may
be
consistent
except
in
one
respect.
the
--
the
logic
of
the
government's
argument
may
be
failing,
but
the
government
was
very
clear
in
stating
there
that
bribery
meant
public
officials
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that's
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
perhaps
i
read
it
too
quickly.
the
government
said
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
in
its
brief
"the
normal
focus,
the
normal
focus."
now
you
can
play
around
with
that
phrase
and
say
now,
"it
only
meant
that
it
was
the
central
issue
or
that
it
was
90%
of
the
time
true."
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
of
course
that's
perfectly
valid
and
of
course,
the
court
in
nardello
with
its
footnote
seemed
to
accept
that
decision.
now,
if
this
is
a
question
that
we're
now
construing
not
only
the
meaning
of
the
term
bribery
but
we're
now
construing
what
the
government's
concession
meant,
just
simply
adds
another
element
to
the
indefiniteness
of
what
we
are
treating.
the
government,
and
of
course
i
have
reference
with
all
due
respect
to
then
deputy
attorney
general's
tying
in
of
the
term
bribery
to
the
term
official
bribery
or
limiting
it
to
that
and
the
same
thing
was
true
of
the
attorney
general
kennedy.
your
honors
will
recall
what
government
counsel
just
said,
when
he
was
asked
about
what's
the
major
legislative
support
that
he
has
for
believing
that
bribery,
means
commercial
bribery
--
means
that
commercial
bribery
and
his
answer
was,
"senator
keating's
observations
un-supports
bribery."
you
look
at,
if
i
may
suggest
it,
the
hearings
in
the
case
and
you'll
see
how
this
somewhat
personalized
statement
by
a
single
legislator
that
nobody
caught
on
to,
that
was
passed
over,
and
this
is
considered
the
largest
legislative
support.
i
suggest
if
we
want
to
see
other
support
for
my
position
that
we
look
at
18
u.s.c.
1961.
1961
is
a
statute
which
talks
about
bribery,
in
one
case,
refers
to
section
201
as
relating
to
bribery
and
then
talks
about
section
224,
not
as
relating
to
bribery,
but
as
relating
sports
bribery.
at
best,
we
have
an
ambiguity
here
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
term.
the
government
has
referred,
your
honor,
also
to
references
to
labor
corruption.
i
touched
down
in
a
moment
before.
your
honors
will
see
at
pages
31,
246
and
272
of
the
house
hearings,
i
haven't
put
that
on
a
brief
but
perhaps
i
can,
shortly
in
a
letter,
if
your
honor
permits,
the
government
was
talking
about
the
immunity
act.
there
was
not
a
word
--
a
proposed
marriot,
there
is
not
a
word
in
dealing
with
this
statute
about
labor
corruption.
the
government
pulls
out
now
what
the
congress
must've
known
about
a
statute
passed
in
1906
in
great
britain.
again,
if
this
is
how
we
are
to
interpret
legislation,
then
i
suggest
it
gives
an
air
of
ambiguity
to
the
statute.
on
the
dictionaries,
i
have
addressed
myself
to
that.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
look
at
those
dictionaries
and
see
whether
those
dictionaries
are
not
consistently,
in
my
favor,
if
they
are
illegal
dictionaries.
but
quite
aside
from
that,
all
they
do
really
is
indicate
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
bribery.
and
the
question
is
whether
in
this
case,
unlike
many
others,
appeal
statute,
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
broadly
or
narrowly.
a
reference
has
been
made
to
the
open-ended
aspect
of
the
statute,
as
read
by
the
government,
and
it's
been
suggested
that
there
are
ways
out
for
it,
but
if
you
take
my
construction
of
the
statute,
which
i
think
is
congress'
and
then
only
congress'
view
and
not
what
a
state
law
says
and
not
what
one
dictionary
or
another
says,
it
is
congress'
view,
mine
gives
a
non
open-ended
situation
because
public
bribery,
governmental
bribery
has
a
precise
meaning.
under
the
government's
definition,
the
moment
a
state
passes
a
statute
like
wisconsin,
for
example,
providing
for
a
$25
fine
for
gratuity,
because
a
gratuity
paid
to
a
chauffeur,
we
then
have
a
real
open-ended
situation.
did
congress
intend
to
make
the
$25
gratuity
to
a
chauffeur
or
a
$100
to
a
lumberman
in
some
other
state?
did
it
intend
to
include
that
in
the
term
bribery?
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
did
but
if
one
looks
at
it,
if
we
can
stand
aside
and
say,
"what
could
congress
had
meant
in
passing
the
statute
directly
to
organized
crime
where
they
had
no
evidence
that
organized
crime
was
using
commercial
bribery?"
it
had
a
concrete
function
and
purpose,
which
a
national
legislator
--
legislature
would
have.
there
is
a
very
serious
crime
in
the
bribery
of
public
officials,
the
one
referred
to
by
deputy
attorney
general
white
and
by
attorney
general
kennedy.
bribery
of
public
officials
is
a
critical
matter,
deserves
a
national
attention
and
is
the
most
reasonable
application
of
the
travel
act.
but
to
say
now
that
because
bribery
could
be
interpreted
by
some
definitions
to
be
broad,
when
commercial
bribery
has
a
line
of
demarcation,
i've
indicated
before,
is
also
to
disregard
what
a
reasonable
congress
would
have
intended
in
addressing
itself
to
this
problem.
thank
you,
your
honor.
