mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
contends
that
the
travel
act
prohibits
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
promote
all
forms
of
bribery,
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law,
including
commercial
bribery.
in
establishing
that
proposition,
we
rely
on
the
text
of
the
travel
act,
the
contemporary
meaning
of
the
words
used
in
the
act
and
the
act's
legislative
history.
in
addition,
we
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
nardello,
which
provides
the
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
which
we
believe
is
controlling
here.
i'd
like
now
to
take
up
each
of
these
points
separately.
the
literal
terms
of
the
travel
act
extend
to
bribery
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
in
which
the
crime
is
committed.
unlike
other
federal
criminal
statutes
such
as
the
official
bribery
statute,
the
travel
act
does
not
limit
its
coverage
to
a
particular
kind
of
bribery.
without
any
limiting
modifier,
the
term
bribery
has
a
generic
meaning
that
is
the
giving
or
the
receipt
of
something
of
value
in
order
to
corrupt
the
judgment
or
the
action
of
someone
in
the
position
of
trust.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
bribery
includes
official
corruption
but
it's
not
limited
to
official
corruption
as
webster's
dictionary
reminds
us.
counsel
has
nonetheless
contended
that
the
weight
of
authority
in
legal
dictionaries
is
different
from
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
oxford
english
dictionary
and
in
webster's
dictionary.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
that
congress
deliberately
selected
a
general
word
without
reference
to
a
particular
kind
of
bribery
because
it
meant
to
embrace
various
federal
and
various
state
bribery
statutes
that
didn't
wish
to
include
a
long
enumeration
of
those
statutes
or
of
state
arsenal
extortion
statutes.
it
would
be
quite
lengthy
and
the
cumbersome
statute
of
each
one
of
the
specific
offenses
was
enumerated.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
contend
that
it
was
a
state
bribery
statute
that
was
violated
through
use
of
interstate
facilities
giving
rise
to
a
violation
of
the
travel
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
--
we
depend
on
a
violation
of
the
louisiana
statute
facilitated
through
the
use
of
interstate
facilities.
counsel
has
contended
for
a
common
law
definition
of
the
word
bribery
pointing
to
the
legal
dictionaries
which
he
contends
are
different
from
the
popular
dictionaries,
but
black's
law
dictionary
defines
a
bribe
--
bribery
as
the
offering
or
soliciting
of
anything
of
value
to
influence
action
as
an
official
or
in
discharge
of
legal
duty
and
it
gives
us
examples,
common
law
bribery
and
commercial
bribery.
the
same
is
true
in
wharton's
law-lexicon
which
defines
a
bribe
as
a
gift
to
any
person,
office
or
holding
a
position
of
trust
with
the
object
of
inducing
him
to
disregard
his
official
duty
or
betray
his
trust.
again,
the
examples
that
are
given
are
official
bribery
and
bribery
of
agents
and
employees.
the
legal
dictionaries
use
the
term
the
same
way
webster's
dictionary
and
the
oxford
dictionary
uses
the
word
as
a
generic
designation
covering
both
official
and
non-official
bribery.
instead
of
designating
a
particular
kind
of
bribery
such
as
official
bribery,
the
statute
refers
to
bribery
offenses
prohibited
under
the
laws
of
congress
or
the
laws
of
the
states.
because
the
scope
of
the
act
is
delineated
by
reference
to
state
or
federal
bribery
law,
we
believe
that
it
is
most
significant
that
a
large
number
of
state
and
several
bribery
laws
passed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
travel
act,
explicitly
extended
to
non-official
bribery.
this
--
this
pattern
of
statutes
confirms
that
in
contemporary
legal
usage
in
1961,
the
term
bribery
had
a
far
broader
meaning
than
official
bribery.
prior
to
enactment
of
the
travel
act,
congress
prescribed
non-official
bribery
in
a
variety
of
different
criminal
laws.
for
example,
congress
prohibited
bribery
in
the
sale
of
liquor,
bribery
in
the
procurement
of
interstate
transportation
and
bribery
of
contestants
of
clearing
in
television
quiz
shows.
the
situation
in
the
states
is
similar.
by
1961,
43
states
had
adopted
criminal
laws
prohibiting
various
forms
of
non-official
bribery,
including
bribery
of
employees
and
agents,
bribery
of
workers
in
particular
kinds
of
industries,
bribery
of
labor
union
officials,
and
bribe
--
bribery
of
athletes
participating
in
sporting
events.
because
of
this
statute's
coverage
is
defined
by
reference
to
state
and
federal
bribery
law,
the
widespread
existence
of
statutes
forbidding
commercial
and
other
forms
of
non-official
bribery
is
a
strong
indication
that
the
travel
act
should
have
a
coextensive
reach.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
to
assume
that
congress
was
unaware
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
states
in
the
union
had
enacted
criminal
laws
forbidding
non-official
corruption
and
it
would
be
even
more
extraordinary
to
assume
that
congress
was
unaware
of
its
own
criminal
legislation
making
commercial
bribery
a
crime.
although
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
is
limited,
the
hearings
show
that
the
proponents
of
the
statute
understood
the
contemporary
generic
meaning
of
the
word
bribery.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
congress'
commercial
bribery
statutes
refer
to
particular
industries
where
the
problem
was
felt
to
be
especially
acute,
for
example
bribery
in
interstate
transportation
and
bribery
in
the
sale
of
liquor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
need
the
--
the
louisiana
statute
as
a
predicate.
senator
keating
who
is
a
proponent
of
the
statute
and
who
participated
in
its
drafting
stated
specifically
that
he
understood
that
the
travel
act
would
apply
to
bribery
in
sporting
events.
this
shows
pretty
clearly
that
congress
did
not
envision
the
statute
as
applying
only
to
official
bribery.
no
contrary
views
were
ever
expressed
during
the
hearings
and
during
the
hearings
on
this
bill
and
its
companion
bills
which
were
heard
altogether
in
a
package,
several
of
the
--
the
witnesses
as
well
as
the
attorney
general
stated
the
view
that
various
forms
of
non-official
corruption
were
bribery,
for
example,
bribery
of
labor
union
officials
and
bribery
--
bribery
in
sporting
events.
no
congressman
or
representative
from
the
department
of
justice
ever
suggested
that
the
act
should
be
limited
to
official
bribery.
the
legislative
history
also
shows
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
travel
act
was
to
cut
off
the
flow
of
profits
to
organized
criminals
by
depriving
them
of
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
carry
on
their
illegal
activities.
for
this
reason,
the
statute
prohibits
arson
and
extortion,
both
of
which
are
used
by
criminals
to
prey
on
honest
business
firms
and
to
increase
illicit
revenues.
commercial
bribery
is
likewise
used
by
organized
crime
to
increase
the
flow
of
money
which
congress
meant
to
cut
off.
congressional
hearings,
both
before
and
after
enactment
of
the
statute
confirm
the
extent
to
which
criminals
make
use
of
commercial
bribery
to
infiltrate
honest
business.
organized
crime
uses
commercial
bribery
to
steal
securities
from
brokerage
houses,
to
pledge
them
with
banks
and
other
lending
institutions,
to
sell
worthless
or
fraudulent
stock
to
institutional
investors
and
to
steal
valuable
cargos
through
the
connivance
of
bribed
workers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
we
contend
though
the
treatment
of
commercial
bribery
as
a
subspecies
of
the
offense
of
bribery
would
promote
the
congressional
purpose
to
cut
off
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true.
if
they
don't
fall
under
the
heading
of
the
word
bribery
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
for
the
purpose
--
the
reasons
that
we
gave,
we
think
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
bribery
extends
generically
to
different
varieties
of
bribery
including
commercial
bribery.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
--
there
had
been
relatively
few
commercial
bribery
prosecutions
under
the
statute
due
in
part
to
the
difficulty
of
detecting
these
offenses,
but
there
have
been
some.
there
have
been
three
reported
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
involving
commercial
bribery
prosecutions.
there
had
been
two
reported
decisions
in
the
district
courts
and
four
other
cases
are
referred
to
unreported
opinions
at
the
district
court
level.
the
department
at
present
has
investigations
pending
into
widespread
commercial
bribery
which
may
in
the
future
result
in
additional
prosecutions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
often
a
problem.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
perrin,
those
are
the
three
court
of
appeal's
decisions
on
this
point.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
--
you
would
have
to
prove
that
interstate
commerce
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
an
offense
under
state
bribery
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
don't
have
to
show
that
it
was
consummated.
the
case
law
is
uniform
to
that
effect.
you
just
have
to
show
that
interstate
facilities
were
used
to
promote
that
offense
and
that
an
overed
act
occurred
after
the
use
of
the
interstate
facilities.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
to
--
for
example
in
this
case,
to
make
--
to
make
easier
the
payment
of
bribery
proceeds
to
the
bribed
employee
even
if
those
proceeds
were
not
in
fact
given
to
the
employee
or
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
--
it
would
be
impossible
to
commit
the
offense
under
louisiana
law,
then
the
use
of
the
interstate
facilities
would
not
be
in
aid
of
a
violation
of
the
state
statute
and
there
would
be
no
travel
act
violation.
we
would
emphasize
that
if
petitioner's
proposed
interpretation
of
the
statute
were
accepted,
syndicate
members
based
for
example
in
new
york
city
could
operate
a
scheme
to
bribe
the
workers
in
a
brokerage
house
in
chicago
or
the
employees
in
a
bank
in
huston
or
los
angeles
causing
serious
financial
losses
and
enriching
organized
crime.
due
to
the
interstate
nature
of
the
offense,
local
authorities
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
effectively
investigate
and
prosecute
the
offenders.
considering
the
generic
text
of
the
statute
and
its
broad
corrective
purposes
such
on
a
narrow,
unnaturally
narrow
interpretation
would
be
inconsistent,
we
submit,
with
the
statutory
design.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
indeed,
your
honor.
the
passage
from
senator
keating
is
the
strongest
piece
of
history.
we
--
we
all
labor
under
--
under
the
difficulty
here
of
a
--
a
very
limited
legislative
history.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
of
unofficial
bribery.
it
shows
that
the
interpretation
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right.
it
shows
that
the
interpretation
that's
being
advanced
by
petitioner
isn't
the
correct
interpretation.
congress
did
not
envision
a
limitation
of
the
act
to
official
bribery.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
did
indeed,
your
honor,
and
he
also
referred
to
bribery
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
companion
bills
that
were
considered
in
a
package
and
we
think
that
these
references
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
other
congressmen
who
participated
in
the
hearings
show
that
these
congressmen
understood
the
contemporary
generic
meaning
of
the
word
bribery.
because
congress
prohibited
bribery
under
the
act
in
general
terms
without
limitation
to
a
particular
kind
of
bribery
and
because
the
legislative
history
supports
the
generic
reading
of
the
statute
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
nardello
provides
the
applicable
rule
of
statutory
interpretation.
in
nardello,
this
court
held
that
the
word
extortion
which
appears
in
the
same
portion
of
the
act,
as
the
word
bribery,
should
be
given
a
generic
meaning
and
should
not
be
limited
to
acts
of
extortion,
involving
public
officials.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
court
did
indeed
point
out
that
bribery
has
traditionally
focused
on
corruption
of
public
officials,
but
the
court
did
not
undertake
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
offense.
if
it
--
if
it
had
gone
into
the
details
of
the
development
of
this
offense,
it
would've
seen
that
by
1906,
commercial
bribery
was
a
criminal
offense
in
great
britain
and
that
by
the
turn
of
the
century,
congress
had
enacted
criminal
laws
forbidding
commercial
bribery
and
the
states
had
as
well.
i
think
the
court's
footnote
statement
is
a
--
is
a
fair
generalization,
but
it
--
it
doesn't
purport
to
exhaust
the
--
the
subject,
its
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
our
--
i
don't
think
our
brief
goes
any
further
than
that
footnote.
i
think
it
simply
says
that
that
traditionally
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
traditionally,
that
offense
is
referred
to
public
officials,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
by
1906,
it
had
gone
quite
beyond
that
in
great
britain
and
shortly
after
it
had
gone
far
beyond
that,
both
at
the
federal
level
and
in
the
states.
in
nardello,
the
court
found
no
language
in
the
travel
act
or
its
history
which
would
confine
the
act
to
official
misconduct
and
the
court
noted
that
extortion
is
generally
understood
to
include
threats
by
private
persons
and
that
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
briefs
speaks
in
generalities
and
that
--
that
it
meant
only
to
--
to
indicate
that
--
at
common
law
that
this
was
the
traditional
focus
of
--
of
the
offense
of
bribery.
i
don't
think
that
it
--
it
purported
to
go
into
a
detailed
analysis
of
--
of
the
development
of
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that
was
the
general
philosophy
of
that
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
of
that
remark,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
a
remark
made
in
light
of
the
full
history
of
the
development
of
this
offense
because
when
that
review
is
undertaken,
it's
clear
as
it
possibly
can
be
that
bribery
applied
by
1906
to
commercial
bribery
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
if
--
if
he
meant
that
to
be
an
absolute
assertion,
it's
historically
incorrect.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
substantially
over
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct
and
i
--
i
think
that
that
was
the
thrust
of
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it
--
as
a
general
proposition,
it's
correct,
but
it's
not
correct.
i
think
it's
fairly
described
as
a
dictum
in
--
in
both
the
opinion
in
the
brief
and
that
further
research
into
the
development
of
this
offense
shows
that
there
is
more
to
the
story
than
--
than
that
brief
summary.
in
contending
for
a
limitation
of
the
act
to
official
bribery,
petitioner
argues
of
course
that
at
common
law,
the
term
bribery
was
limited
to
various
forms
of
official
corruption
and
that
the
travel
act
should
be
limited
to
that
same
scope.
in
our
view,
the
nardello
case
really
isn't
sufficient
answer
to
that
assertion.
nardello
declined
to
adopt
the
common
law
definition
of
the
word
extortion,
concluding
that
the
modern
generic
interpretation
was
better
suited
to
serving
congress'
purposes.
in
addition,
as
we've
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
common
law
definition
of
the
word
bribery
is
not
a
useful
standard
reference
in
construing
the
act.
the
common
law
definition
was
subject
to
continuous
change
in
evolution.
it
was
a
compound
offense
developing
both
through
statutory
enactment
and
through
common
law
development.
by
the
19th
century,
it
extended
not
only
to
judges,
which
was
the
original
offense,
but
also
extended
to
various
other
public
officials
and
certain
private
persons
such
as
voters.
and
by
1906,
by
statutory
enactment
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
and
by
1906,
great
britain
had
concluded
that
persons
in
a
position
of
private
trust
were
vested
within
a
--
a
position
of
importance
to
the
public
and
prohibited
commercial
bribery.
we
think
it
would
be
highly
arbitrary
to
select
the
common
law
prior
to
1906
as
the
standard
of
reference
in
construing
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
bribery
illegal
under
common
law
prior
to
1906.
it
says,
"bribery
illegal
under
the
laws
of
congress
and
the
laws
of
the
50
states,"
which
is
far
different
from
the
common
law
definition
as
we've
previously
discussed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
--
that's
indeed
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
his
statement
is
--
is
incorrect,
but
your
memory
is
quite
correct.
in
1961,
13
states
had
general
statutes
making
commercial
bribery
a
criminal
offense.
an
additional
12
states
had
narrower
statutes
focusing
on
particular
persons
in
particular
lines
of
industry.
these
were
more
specific
commercial
bribery
laws.
thirty
two
states
had
criminal
laws
forbidding
bribery
in
sporting
events
which
is
quite
a
departure
from
the
common
law.
there
was
no
common
law
offense
of
--
of
bribery
of
athletes.
additional
states
had
statutes
making
it
a
criminal
offense
to
bribe
persons
such
as
architects
or
labor
union
officials.
in
all,
by
1961,
43
states
have
statutes
prohibiting
non-official
bribery,
going
beyond
the
common
law
definition.
great
britain
had
the
statute
prohibiting
commercial
bribery.
congress
had
several
of
them.
at
present,
49
states
have
statutes
forbidding
non-official
bribery,
going
beyond
the
common
law
definition.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
some
of
the
states
do
not
use
the
synonym
such
as
corruption.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
our
appendix,
we
--
we
only
cite
state
statutes
that
use
the
word
bribery.
we
--
we
base
our
argument
on
statutes
to
do
that
but
there
--
we
believe
that
if
the
state
law
prohibits
the
payment
or
the
receipt
of
money
to
affect
the
judgment
of
someone
in
a
position
of
trust.
it
falls
within
the
generic
definition
of
the
word
bribery,
just
the
way
the
blackmail
fell
within
the
generic
definition
of
the
word
extortion
in
nardello.
it
was
embraced
within
the
generic
definition
and
we
think
on
similar
principles,
those
laws
would
be
included
as
well,
although
it
didn't
decide
--
we
didn't
cite
them.
we
constructed
that
chart
in
a
conservative
way.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
do
indeed.
if
a
--
if
a
state
such
as
idaho
which
now
has
no
--
it's
only
state
that
now
has
no
commercial
bribery
legislation,
if
it
--
if
it
adopted
a
statute
making
it
legal
to
bribe
a
doctor,
that
would
be
bribery
in
violation
of
state
law
and
it
would
be
embraced
under
the
travel
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
no
your
honor,
we
don't.
we
--
we
only
would
contend
that
this
would
be
another
subspecies
within
the
generic
definition
of
bribery
that
would
fall
under
the
ban
of
the
statute
because
the
state
had
enacted
it.
bribery
of
architects
or
bribery
of
lawyers
or
examples
of
new
kinds
of
bribery
that
the
states
could
forbid
but
which
would
fall
within
the
generic
definition
of
the
word
bribery
used
by
congress.
congress
meant
to
leave
the
definition
open
ended.
it
referred
to
bribery
generally
and
left
the
definition
or
the
particularization
to
the
state
statutes,
but
your
--
your
initial
point
was
quite
correct
that
you
--
you
need
a
two
step
analysis.
is
it
within
the
generic
definition
of
bribery,
one
and
two,
is
it
forbidden
by
a
state
law?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
--
we
think
it's
a
necessity
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
list
all
of
the
variance
of
state
law,
arson
for
example
or
state
law
extortion
using
different
words.
this
is
how
the
court
construed
the
act
in
nardello
in
the
manner
that
i
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
i
do.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
i
--
i
only
meant
to
say
what
the
court
said
in
nardello
that
the
word
has
a
generic
meaning.
i
--
the
word
open
ended
is
less
solicitor's
description,
generic
is
the
proper
term.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
we
think
that's
the
necessary
meaning
of
the
nardello
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely,
it's
a
very
same
issue.
petitioners
also
argued
that
the
travel
act
cannot
be
applied
here
because
extension
of
the
act
of
commercial
bribery
without
a
proven
association
with
organized
crime
would
result
in
the
prosecution
of
insignificant
local
offenses
and
would
extend
federal
jurisdiction
over
state
crimes.
we
note
in
response
that
the
present
case
is
far
from
an
insignificant
one,
involving
as
it
does,
a
well
organized
criminal
venture,
intended
to
exploit
stolen
geological
data,
showing
the
location
of
oil
deposits.
and
as
a
general
matter,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
commercial
bribery
is
likely
to
involve
an
insignificant
offense.
both
official
and
commercial
bribery
have
the
clear
potential
to
injure
the
public.
in
addition
to
enriching
criminals
and
inflicting
private
losses,
commercial
bribery
has
the
potential
to
cut
off
honest
competition
and
to
cause
the
distribution
of
inferior
products
to
the
consuming
public.
prosecution
of
commercial
bribery
under
the
travel
act
like
prosecution
of
official
bribery
would
naturally
involve
an
exercise
of
authority
over
persons
who
violate
state
law,
but
the
act
was
clearly
intended
to
have
just
that
effect.
it
explicitly
applies
to
bribery
illegal
under
federal
or
state
law.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out,
the
very
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
aid
local
law
enforcement
officials
by
punishing
persons
who
use
interstate
facilities
to
carry
on
the
designated
illegal
activities.
and
there
is
nothing
improper,
we
submit,
about
applying
substantial
penalties
to
violations
of
the
act
when
it's
triggered
by
state
law
offenses.
congress
believed
that
interstate
schemes
to
carry
on
bribery
in
violation
of
either
federal
or
state
law
posed
a
serious
national
threat.
and
where
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
are
used,
it
is
for
congress
to
select
the
means
necessary
to
punish
and
deter
the
offenders.
petitioner's
final
contention
of
course
is
that
its
conviction
must
be
reversed
under
the
rule
of
lenity.
he
argues
in
this
connection
that
the
statute
is
vague
and
that
it
must
therefore
be
narrowly
construed
in
his
favor,
but
the
travel
act
does
not
present
a
vagueness
problem.
the
statute's
literal
realm
extends
to
bribery
without
limitation
on
its
kind.
the
literal
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
bribery
is
generic.
when
the
act
was
passed,
the
word
bribery
had
been
applied
repeatedly
to
commercial
corruption
in
a
wide
variety
of
different
federal
and
state
criminal
laws.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
although
it's
sparse,
shows
that
its
proponents
viewed
the
term
bribery
in
a
contemporary
generic
sense
and
the
dominant
statutory
purpose
that
is
cutting
off
the
flow
of
money
to
organized
crime
strongly
supports
the
view
that
commercial
bribery
should
be
covered.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
has
a
plausible
claim
that
he
could
not
have
known
that
his
conduct
was
subject
to
criminal
sanctions.
he
was
well
aware
that
his
actions
were
wrongful
as
the
evidence
at
trial
showed.
he
had
clear
notice
that
his
conduct
was
in
violation
of
the
louisiana
criminal
statute
which
triggered
application
of
the
travel
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
have
not
your
honor.
he
was
of
course
also
on
notice
from
this
court's
nardello
decision
that
the
terms
of
the
act
would
receive
a
generic
interpretation
and
would
not
be
restricted
to
common
law
meanings.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true
your
honor,
but
he
was
on
notice
that
the
course
he
was
embarked
on
would
lead
to
criminal
penalties.
that's
--
that's
our
only
point,
that
this
isn't
an
innocent
individual
who
believed
that
the
actions
that
he
was
undertaking
were
lawful.
the
only
court
of
appeals
to
have
ruled
on
the
precise
question
presented
here
had
concluded
before
petitioner
became
and
a
scheme
to
--
became
involved
in
the
scheme
to
commit
bribery,
that
the
travel
act
did
in
fact
extend
to
commercial
bribery.
that's
the
unanimous
decision
in
united
states
against
pomponio.
this
is
not
then
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
required
to
speculate
about
the
illegality
of
his
actions.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
case
of
sec
against
cm
joiner,
the
rule
of
strict
construction
is
not
violated
by
permitting
the
words
of
the
statute
to
have
their
full
meaning,
or
the
more
extended
of
two
meanings,
as
the
broader
popular,
instead
of
the
more
narrow
technical
one.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
rewis
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
rewis
is
quite
different.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
proof
that
the
defendants
had
used
interstate
facilities
to
carry
on
the
illegal
scheme
and
where
the
government
proves
that
interstate
facilities
are
used,
that's
an
entirely
different
question.
where
interstate
facilities
are
used
there
is
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
--
the
approach
that
the
court
used
there
was
predicated
on
the
absence
of
interstate
commerce.
when
there
is
no
interstate
commerce
then
the
federal
interest
is
no
longer
significant.
the
local
interest
is
paramount.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
defendants
stayed
in
florida.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
an
occasional
patron
went
across
the
state
line,
but
the
defendants
did
not
use
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
to
promote
the
offense.
that's
the
essential
difference
in
the
cases.
as
this
court
also
pointed
out
in
the
scarborough
case,
the
rule's
strict
construction
is
not
required
where
unless
after
seizing
everything
from
which
aid
can
be
derived,
the
statute
remains
ambiguous.
here,
we
think
when
the
usual
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
are
used,
there
is
no
ambiguity
and
we
accordingly,
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
