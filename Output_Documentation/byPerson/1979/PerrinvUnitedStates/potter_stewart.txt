or

various
other
local
laws
that
concededly
are
not
covered
by
the

too?
justice
potter

this
is
so
an
inclusion
of
a
lot
of
other
crimes
that
are
--
local
crimes
that
are
not
--
that
are
concededly
not
covered
by
the
travel
act.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
perhaps
the
question,
is
it
covered
or
isn't
it
covered?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

organized
crime
uses
these
various
things.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
your
brief
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
--
we
have
it
on
file,
wouldn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
private
person
when
carrying
on
--
public
duties,
voters
and
jurors
and
people
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
judge
gurfein
in
the
brecht
opinion
said
as
i
remember
that
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
federal
law,
there
were
only
some
13
states,
that's
my
recollection,
that
had
--
that
made
the
commercial
bribery
a
criminal
offense
and
--
and
he
further
added
somewhere
in
his
opinion
that
in
some
of
the
states,
they
don't
even
--
those
offenses
don't
even
use
the
word
bribery.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
represents
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
if
my
memory
is
correct
and
be
if
my
memory
is
correct
is
his
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
judge
gurfein's
point
that
at
least
some
of
the
state
general
statutes
in
prohibiting
this
sort
of
non-common
law
activity
didn't
even
use
the
word
bribery.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
query
is
it
a
synonym?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
in
1985,
the
state
of
idaho,
enacts
a
law,
making
it
a
criminal
offense
to
pay
money
to
--
in
the
commercial
transaction
to
get
a
benefit
that
you
wouldn't
otherwise
get
without
mentioning
the
word
bribery,
then
somebody
who
travels
into
idaho
and
violates
that
statute
is
guilty
of
the
violation
of
the
travel
act,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
--
have
any
charges
ever
been
made
against
this
defendant
under
the
louisiana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
we
--
that's
exactly
the
approach
that
was
rejected
in
the
rewis
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
broad
literal
meaning
of
the
statute
would
have
led
to
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
--
convictions
in
rewis.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
the
questions
are
different
though.
we're
talking
now
about
the
approach
to
which
the
court
should
come
to
the
statute.
