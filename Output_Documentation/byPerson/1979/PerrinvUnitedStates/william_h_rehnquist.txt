justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boudin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
--
do
you
feel
that
the
old
card
decisions
of
this
court
of
mr.
justice
story
hudson,
goodwin
and
so
forth
help
or
hinder
you
when
they
say
there
is
no
federal
common
law
of
crimes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
that
we
think
judicial
note
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
raised
as
a
constitutional
question
in
the
court's
below?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
constitutional
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
shapiro
wouldn't
one
expect
in
view
of
the
very
specific
language
in
--
about
the
payment
of
federal
excise
tax
in
1026
that
the
bribery
if
it'd
be
federal
bribery
here
be
violation
of
a
specific
bribery
statute
and
not
just
of
some
generic
concept
of
bribery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
federal
bribery
statute
do
you
contend
was
violated
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
need
--
needn't
worry
about
actual
federal
bribery
statutes
on
the
books
because
you
need
in
order
to
succeed
in
order
to
show
--
to
show
that
the
louisiana
commercial
bribery
statute
was
violated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
has
made
its
commercial
bribery
a
crime,
why
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
louisiana
statute
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
couldn't
convict
under
those
statutes
here
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
each
case,
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
show
all
of
the
substantive
elements
of
the
state
statute
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
have
to
all
--
don't
you
also
have
to
prove
that
the
offense
under
state
bribery
law
was
committed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
it
mean
to
promote
an
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
--
what
if
under
the
state
of
louisiana
holdings,
the
person
in
question
whom
you
prosecuted
had
been
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
not
to
be
an
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
footnote
in
nardello
that
your
opponent
relies
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
meaning
of
the
travel
act
expands
after
it
was
passed
because
more
and
more
states
passed
commercial
bribery
statutes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
would
it
be
the
generic
bribe
--
you
need
two
elements
under
the
travel
act.
you
need
a
bribery
generically
and
you
need
a
violation
of
the
state
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
idaho
statute
enlarged
the
generic
meaning
of
the
word
bribery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
common
facet
of
a
criminal
statute
to
leave
the
definition
open
ended?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
this
prosecution,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
shown
a
complete
violation
of
the
louisiana
statute,
would
you?
