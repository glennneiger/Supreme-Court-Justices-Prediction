mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
at
issue
is
the
construction
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
magistrates
act.
the
respondent,
who
has
previously
been
convicted
of
numerous
crimes,
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
on
one
count
of
unlawful
receiving
a
firearm.
prior
to
trial,
the
respondent
moves
to
suppress
various
statements
he
had
made
to
the
chicago
police
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
also
to
federal
agents
on
two
subsequent
occasions.
the
respondent
claimed
that
these
statements
were
inadmissible
as
a
matter
of
both
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
law.
in
accordance
with
section
636(b)(1)(b)
of
the
federal
magistrates
act,
the
district
court
designated
a
magistrate
to
conduct
and
evidentiary
hearing
regarding
respondent's
pretrial
suppression
motion.
following
an
extensive
hearing,
the
magistrate
made
proposed
findings
of
fact,
rejecting
respondent's
claim.
in
particular,
the
magistrate
found
that
the
testimony
of
the
federal
agents
was
more
credible
than
that
of
respondent
and
he
recommended
that
the
motion
be
denied.
the
district
court
thereafter,
pursuant
to
section
636(b)(1)(c)
of
the
federal
magistrates
act,
made
a
"de
novo
determination"
of
respondent's
motion.
that
is,
the
district
court
made
a
thorough
review
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
held
before
the
magistrate,
the
magistrate's
report
and
the
submission
of
the
parties,
and
he
thereafter
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
subsequently,
the
respondent
was
convicted
based
on
the
evidence
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
some
stipulated
facts.
on
appeal,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
first
acknowledged
that
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
had
complied
with
the
federal
magistrates
act.
the
court
further
found
that
the
federal
magistrates
act
did
not
violate
article
3
of
the
constitution.
nonetheless,
the
court
concluded
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
requires
the
district
court
either
to
defer
to
the
magistrate's
proposed
findings
of
fact
or
to
rehear
the
testimony
itself.
and
since
the
statute
prohibits
the
deference
that
the
court
felt
that
the
due
process
clause
requires,
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
second
duplicative
suppression
hearing
to
be
conducted
personally
by
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it
wasn't
a
formal
trial,
as
i
understand
it.
the
trial
was
based
on
the
stipulations
and
the
transcript.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
let
me
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
your
hypothetical,
the
defendant
moved
prior
to
trial
and
had
a
hearing
before
a
magistrate?
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no.
again,
that
would
be
the
same
thing
as
this
case.
once
the
magistrate
has
conducted
the
hearing
and
a
district
court
has
made
its
de
novo
determination
of
the
motion,
that
is
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
now
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
he
has
had
an
impartial
arbiter
evaluate
his
testimony
and
thereafter
the
district
court
makes
its
de
novo
determination
of
the
motion.
he
has
gotten
more
in
fact
than
what
jackson
v.
denno
requires.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
under
18
u.s.c.
3501
(a)
or
(b).
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
and
in
jackson
v.
denno,
of
course
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
in
jackson
v.
denno,
of
course,
the
court
held
that
the
jury
that
determines
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
permitted
to
make
that
initial
determination.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
compare
one
to
the
other,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
say
that
he
is
an
impartial
arbiter,
he
is
not
some
person
off
the
street.
he
is
a
federal
employee
who
--
you
know,
there
is
no
claim
in
this
proceeding
that
the
magistrate
misconducted
the
hearing
in
any
way.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
you
can.
in
a
footnote
in
jackson
v.
denno
and
also
in
lego
v.
twomey,
the
court
reiterated
that
you
could
give
it
to
a
jury,
it
just
can't
be
the
same
jury
that
decides
guilt
or
innocence.
in
other
words,
you
could
have
a
suppression
hearing
at
which
a
jury
was
empaneled
and
listen
to
the
evidence
and
made
a
determination
of
voluntariness.
thereafter
at
trial
you
would
have
to
have
another
jury
decide
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
court
made
quite
clear
in
both
jackson
v.
denno
and
in
footnote
9,
i
believe
it
is,
of
lego
v.
twomey
that
it
has
just
got
to
be
a
neutral
fact-finder,
that
is
the
trial
judge,
another
judge
or
another
jury.
it
just
can't
be
the
jury
that
tries
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
theory
i
think
in
jackson
v.
denno
is
that
the
jury
will
be
misled
as
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
because
it
will
look
to
reliability.
and
since
the
question
of
voluntariness
does
not
involve
the
question
of
reliability
but
rather
involves
solely
the
question
of
the
policeman's
behavior
or
the
constable's
conduct,
the
court
said
that
due
process
requires
that
a
neutral
fact-finder
that
is
not
concerned
with
guilt
or
innocence
make
the
determination.
in
this
court,
the
respondent
makes
essentially
three
claims
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
is
not
final.
it
is
not
determinative
and
he
has
no
power
to
make
a
determination.
the
statute
divides
pretrial
matters
into
two
kinds
of
categories.
as
to
most
pretrial
matters,
which
i
will
call
procedural
for
want
of
a
matter
nomenclature,
or
subsection
(a)
matters,
the
magistrate
is
authorized
to
"hear
and
determine
the
matter,"
and
as
to
that
the
district
court
makes
a
review
as
if
it
were
a
court
of
appeals.
that
is,
it
can
reverse
for
errors
of
law
and
for
findings
of
fact
which
are
clearly
erroneous.
however,
as
to
subsection
(b)
or
case
dispositive
motions
as
are
sometimes
referred
to,
which
include
prisoner
petitioners,
motions
to
suppress
evidence
in
a
criminal
case,
prisoner
petitions
regarding
the
conditions
of
confinement,
as
to
those
kinds
of
more
important
motions,
congress
established
a
different
standard
of
review,
that
is
the
magistrate
only
makes
a
proposed
finding
of
fact
and
recommendations
of
law
and
it
is
the
district
court
which
actually
must
make
the
decision,
and
he
does
not
have
to
give
a
clearly
erroneous
deference
to
the
fact-finding
or
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
could.
he
is
empowered
to
do
that.
he
is
also
empowered
to
send
it
back
to
the
magistrate
for
further
hearings,
to
recommit
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
accept,
reject
or
modify
in
whole
or
in
part.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
for
good
reason
concluded
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
not
holding
such
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it
may,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
a
few
moments
ago,
be
determinative
of
the
trial.
but
in
lego
v.
twomey,
this
court
made
quite
clear
that
the
question
at
the
suppression
hearing,
clearly
a
voluntariness
hearing
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
and
as
has
been
repeated
by
this
court
on
many
occasions,
and
a
question
--
we
don't
denigrate
the
importance
of
suppression
hearings
in
terms
of
effectuating
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
suspect
that
there
are
a
fair
number
of
guilty
pleas
if
the
defendant
loses
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
don't
know
specifically
at
this
point.
our
position
and
a
critical
question
on
the
statutory
matter
is
what
is
a
"de
novo
determination."
our
position
is
quite
clear.
a
de
novo
determination
is
a
thorough
review
of
the
evidence
induced
before
the
magistrate,
the
magistrate's
report
and
submission
of
the
parties.
the
respondent's
position
is
not
quite
so
clear.
they
say
that
de
novo
determination
means
what
we
say
it
means
some
of
the
time,
but
other
times
it
means
a
de
novo
hearing,
and
they
distinguish
and
they
say
that
it
means
that
a
de
novo
hearing
any
time
that
the
credibility
of
the
witness
is
called
into
question,
in
other
words
any
time
there
is
a
conflict
in
testimony.
but
of
course
in
a
suppression
hearing,
and
certainly
habeas
proceedings
and
all
of
those
kinds
of
proceedings,
virtually
every
pretrial
hearing
is
going
to
involve
conflicting
testimony,
so
therefore
respondent's
real
position
i
take
it
is
that
in
most
cases
two
hearings
will
be
required.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
true.
although
respondent
hasn't
addressed
that
claim
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
think,
you
might
ask
them
whether
or
not
a
second
hearing
would
be
required.
at
the
outset,
it
is
quite
apparent
in
our
view
that
the
act,
that
respondent's
construction
of
the
act
would
utterly
defeat
congress'
purpose.
congress
enacted
the
magistrates
act
to
relieve
the
district
courts
from
the
tremendous
burden
in
litigation.
the
statistics
are
fairly
overwhelming.
and
in
particular,
congress
said
in
1976,
when
it
amended
the
act,
we
want
magistrates
to
conduct
these
kinds
of
evidentiary
hearings.
to
require
two
hearings
in
every
case
would
just
obviously
defeat
what
congress
sought
to
do,
to
relieve
the
district
courts
of
pretrial
matters
so
that
they
could
conduct
trials
and
make
decisions.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
they
could
consent
to
it,
that's
right.
i
don't
think
the
respondent
could
contest
it,
but
the
respondent
here
of
course
did
not
consent.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
squarely
refute
respondent's
claim.
the
act
does
not
say
the
district
court
is
required
to
make
a
de
novo
hearing
of
the
evidence.
it
says
it
must
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
the
magistrate's
report.
this
distinction
in
language
makes
it
clear,
it
seems
to
us,
that
there
is
not
a
de
novo
hearing
requirement.
it
is
simply,
on
contrast
to
subsection
(a)
motions,
a
kind
of
review
pattern.
it
is
not
the
clearly
erroneous
pattern.
it
is
a
de
novo
determination
pattern.
moreover,
the
act
itself
empowers
the
district
judge
to
conduct
a
second
hearing.
now,
if
that
grant
of
power
be
wholly
unnecessary,
if
de
novo
determination
meant
de
novo
hearing,
the
power
would
already
be
there.
obviously
congress
thought
it
meant
something
else.
finally,
where
congress
thought
it
important
in
the
body
of
the
act
to
require
the
district
court
to
make
a
second
hearing
or
to
reheat
the
testimony,
it
expressly
provided.
636(d)
talks
about
contempt
proceedings.
when
contempt
occurs
before
a
magistrate,
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
district
court
must
hear
the
testimony.
here,
however,
he
only
must
make
a
de
novo
determination,
something
quite
different.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
legislative
history
i
think
answers
any
questions
on
this
point.
the
original
version
of
the
1976
amendment
provided
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
rehear
the
testimony.
congress
rejected
this
language
and
said
instead
of
hear
de
novo,
they
put
in
de
novo
determination,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
that
language
comes
from
a
ninth
circuit
decision
called
campbell
v.
united
states
district
court,
which
is
quoted
at
length
and
with
approval
in
the
house
report
accompanying
the
1976
amendment.
in
campbell,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
district
court
could
designate
a
magistrate
to
conduct
a
suppression
hearing
and
that
thereafter
the
district
court
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
the
motion,
which
did
not
mean
that
it
had
to
rehear
the
testimony.
and
the
report
itself,
the
house
report
itself
states
that,
and
i
roughly
quote,
"use
of
the
words
de
novo
determination
is
not
intended
to
require
the
district
judge
to
conduct
a
new
hearing
on
contested
issues,"
squarely
and
flatly
refuting
the
respondent's
construction
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that
would
not
be
a
pretrial
motion
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
and
the
act
speaks
about
pretrial
motions,
so
therefore
i
don't
think
it
would
be
statutory
power
to
do
that.
i
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
although
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
circumstance
for
a
district
judge
to
do
that,
because
it
would
certainly
delay
the
process
and
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
hypothetical
where
a
district
judge
would
really
want
to
do
that.
normally
questions
of
admissability
can
be
determined
quite
readily
during
the
course
of
trial,
and
a
district
judge
would
have
no
reason
to.
but
where
he
knows
that
he
can
set
up
his
schedule
and
designate
magistrate
to
conduct
certain
pretrial
motions,
then
he
would
be
inclined
to
do
so.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
under
the
statute
he
would
have
no
power
to
do
that?
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
asking
me
whether
hypothetically
the
statute
provided
that,
would
it
be
constitutional,
and
i
didn't
see
any
problem.
the
respondent
defends
the
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
and
the
respondent
agrees
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
either
that
the
district
judge
defer
to
the
magistrate's
proposed
findings
of
fact
or
to
rehear
the
testimony,
but
this
analysis
doesn't
make
any
sense
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
here
the
district
court
adopted
the
magistrate's
findings.
if
the
district
court
had
merely
deferred
to
the
magistrate's
findings,
it
would
have
again
denied
the
motion.
that
it
made
a
more
thorough
review
and
did
not
defer
could
not
possibly
have
deprived
the
respondent
of
any
kind
of
procedural
protections.
in
fact,
he
received
more
protection
because
he
got
a
more
thorough
review.
we
also
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
is
flawed
in
failing
to
consider
the
three
facts
that
this
court
has
set
forth
which
should
be
considered
in
determining
what
process
is
due
in
a
particular
circumstance.
that
is
the
personal
interest
involved,
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
of
that
interest,
and
the
government's
administrative
and
financial
interests
in
adhering
to
the
procedure
set
forth.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
the
standard
would
certainly
be
different
because
he
would
be
able
to
review
and
overturn
him,
that
is
the
district
court
would
be
able
to
overturn
the
magistrate
even
though
the
findings
of
fact
were
not
"clearly
erroneous."
he
would
be
able
to
overturn
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
but
i
think
in
this
criminal
case
the
respondent
can't
raise
the
deprivation
that
might
occur
to
others.
here
in
this
case,
he
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing
before
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate
made
proposed
findings
of
fact
against
him.
those
findings
have
ample
support
in
the
record
and
the
district
court,
upon
making
a
thorough
review
of
that
record,
the
magistrate's
report
and
the
submissions
of
the
parties
concluded
that
the
motion
should
be
denied.
the
case
would
be
a
more
difficult
one
perhaps
where
it
was
purely
a
swearing
contest
between
a
defendant
and
a
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
question.
when
it
is
purely
a
swearing
contest
--
and
the
evidence
is
equally
balanced
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
you
have
to
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
why
we
say
in
our
brief
that
the
district
court
could
reverse
the
magistrate's
proposed
findings
in
a
case
like
this
one,
for
example,
where
there
are
objective
factors
in
the
record
to
support
the
magistrate,
what
the
magistrate
actually
concluded.
but
let's
assume
that
the
magistrate
concluded
that
he
believed
respondent,
well,
there
are
various
objective
factors
in
this
record
which
make
respondent's
testimony
fairly
incredible
at
points,
from
which
upon
reading
from
the
cold
record
you
can
tell
that
the
respondent
--
he
admitted
that
he
lied
on
november
19th,
his
august
8th
--
he
claims
he
made
no
statement
on
august
8th,
yet
that
statement
that
is
attributed
to
him
by
the
chicago
police
and
appears
in
the
arrest
report
is
the
same
statement
that
he
admits
having
made
on
january
12th.
and
it
is
just
inherently
incredible
that
the
chicago
police
made
up
a
statement
which
respondent
admits
that
he
subsequently
made
in
january
following
his
arrest.
so
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
where
there
are
objective
factors
aside
from
the
just
a
pure
swearing
contest,
the
district
court
in
making
its
de
novo
determination
could
reverse
the
magistrate.
obviously,
the
district
court
is
on
shaky
ground
in
those
circumstances
where
it
is
purely
a
swearing
contest
and
he
simply
reverses
the
magistrate,
and
that
is
a
much
more
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that
would
be
difficult
to
do,
but
here
we
don't
have
that
problem,
of
course,
because
he
adopted
the
magistrate's
findings.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct,
but
due
process
may
come
into
play
at
some
point
where
it
is
purely
a
swearing
contest
and
the
district
court
reverses
the
magistrate.
of
course,
as
i
said
before,
that
did
not
happen
here.
the
magistrate
evaluated
the
respondent's
testimony
and
he
found
it
not
to
be
credible
and
the
district
court
adopted
those
findings.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
although
that
would
be
similar
to
what
happens
in
agency
proceedings.
the
same
kind
of
relationship
that
exists
between
the
magistrate
and
the
district
court
exists
in
agency
proceedings,
in
the
british
special
master
situation,
in
special
masters
in
original
cases
in
this
court,
and
normally
the
reviewing
court
or
the
court
that
has
the
power
to
enter
the
judgment
does
not
simply
toss
aside
the
magistrate's
findings,
and
it
normally
would
give
them
credit
for
what
are
worth
based
on
his
independent
review
of
the
record.
and
when
the
reviewing
court
reviews,
let's
say,
the
sec's
determination
of
something,
it
may
be
that
the
alj
concluded
adversely
to
the
agency's
finding
of
fact,
and
that
is
something
again
under
universal
camera
corp.,
this
court's
decision
in
universal
camera
corp.,
that
the
reviewing
court
can
take
into
account
as
to
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
or
whether
the
district
court's
determination
is
erroneous.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
where,
of
course,
the
only
issue
is
credibility,
the
district
court,
if
you
wanted
to
reverse
the
magistrate
and
the
only
issue
was
credibility
and
the
evidence
was
equipoised
between
the
defendant
and
the
police
officer,
then
the
district
court
cannot
simply
ignore
the
magistrate's
determination
of
credibility.
if
you
wish
to
reverse
the
magistrate
in
that
circumstance,
he
would
probably
have
to
rehear
the
testimony
or
recommit
it
back
to
the
magistrate
for
further
findings.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
due
process.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
because
in
the
case
in
which
there
was
solely
credibility
at
issue
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
but
that
is
a
big
difference
because
here
an
impartial
neutral
article
3
adjunct
has
evaluated
the
credibility
and
made
specific
findings
about
that
credibility
and
the
district
court
has
credited
those
findings
based
on
his
independent
review
of
the
record,
so
therefore,
just
like
an
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
and
then
he
would
be
giving
the
magistrate's
report
that
credibility
which
it
is
due.
he
would
say
i
trust
the
magistrate,
the
magistrate
has
made
a
finding,
having
viewed
credibility,
the
magistrate
is
equally
competent
as
the
district
judge
to
evaluate
a
simple
matter
of
credibility.
juries
are
entrusted
in
our
system
to
evaluate
credibility,
and
it
doesn't
take
a
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
a
much
more
thorough
review
than
a
simple
clearly
erroneous
standard.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
when
it
says
de
novo
hearing
or
de
novo
review.
this
is
a
de
novo
determination
of
the
magistrate's
report.
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
district
courts
to
rehear
testimony
on
contested
issues.
that
statement
appears
over
and
over
again
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
to
contrast
it
to
subsection
(a)
in
which
the
magistrate
hears
and
determines
motions
and
the
district
court
must
give
deference
on
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
to
the
magistrate's
findings.
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
simply
misevaluated
the
three
factors
underlying
the
due
process
analysis.
in
lego
v.
twomey,
this
court
made
clear
that
a
suppression
hearing
does
not
implicate
the
important
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
conduct
of
the
police
that
is
in
question
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
evidence
which
is
wholly
probative
and
relevant
shall
be
kept
out
because
of
the
conduct
of
the
police.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
this
to
be
a
very
--
have
a
high
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation,
yet
this
same
kind
of
proceeding
has
been
used
in
england
for
many
years,
it
is
used
in
all
of
the
administrative
agencies,
and
it
is
used
by
this
court
in
its
original
jurisdiction
cases.
and
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
at
all
address
the
government's
substantial
interests
in
using
magistrates.
there
is
a
terrible
problem
of
congested
litigation
and
magistrates
in
a
recent
article
appearing
in
16
harvard
journal
of
legislation,
it
has
been
shown
that
a
study
shows
that
the
use
of
magistrates
has
increased
by
a
third
the
ability
of
district
courts
to
dispose
of
cases.
in
1979,
over
3,000
evidentiary
hearings
were
conducted
by
magistrates
under
section
636(b)(1)(b),
a
considerable
saving
of
time.
and
these
things
were
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
all.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
might.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
18
u.s.c.
3501
requires
in
a
federal
case
if
the
defendant
wants
it
that
the
jury
consider
voluntariness
separate
and
apart
from
the
pretrial
submission.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
was
passed
in
1968
as
part
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
de
novo
language
in
this
case,
in
this
statute
is
much
different
than
the
de
novo
language
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
thinking
about
and
which
--
and
the
cases
the
respondent
relies
on.
this
is
not
a
de
novo
hearing,
it
is
a
de
novo
determination,
and
in
the
act
itself
congress
uses
the
words
"hear"
and
"determine"
and
when
it
wants
the
district
court
to
do,
and
it
enabled
the
magistrate
to
do
so.
so
therefore
in
contrasting
that
language,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
even
in
the
language
of
the
act,
much
less
the
legislative
history,
does
support
the
government's
position.
second,
respondent's
position
as
to
the
due
process
point
would
render
suspect
numerous
kinds
of
proceedings
in
which
the
original
initial
trier
of
fact,
the
person
who
evaluates
credibility
is
not
the
person
who
makes
a
determination
of
fact.
that
is,
in
agency
proceedings
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
in
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
in
mildner
v.
gulotta,
the
case
involved
bar
proceeding,
disbarment
proceedings
in
the
state
of
new
york,
precisely
like
the
sort
of
situation.
it
was
a
referee
who
conducted
the
official
kind
of
proceeding,
evaluated
the
witness's
credibility,
the
lawyer's
testimony
against
complaining
witnesses,
and
his
decision
was
not
determinative.
he
had
no
power
to
determine.
thereafter
the
appellate
division
court
in
reviewing
the
record
made
the
de
novo
determination,
and
the
language
is
in
the
case.
the
three-judge
court
upheld
that
statute,
this
court
summarily
affirmed,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
case
is
fairly
dispositive
of
the
due
process
point
that
is
argued
here
by
respondent.
and
in
that
case
there
was
some
suggestion
that
the
appellate
courts
were
reversing
the
referee's
findings.
here,
of
course,
the
district
court
has
affirmed
and
adopted
the
magistrate's
finding,
the
person
who
has
evaluated
the
credibility.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
is
to
credit
it
for
what
it
is
worth.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
he
first
makes
a
de
novo
determination,
a
thorough
review
and
he
has
to
make
the
thorough
review
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
can.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
but
preceding
his
determination
to
credit
the
magistrate
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
there
must
be
a
de
novo
determination
and
the
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
but
if
i
could
just
finish
this
one
answer.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
where
he
is
reversing,
where
there
is
a
pure
swearing
contest
and
he
is
reversing,
it
may
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
under
the
statute
for
him
to
simply
ignore
the
credibility
findings
of
the
magistrate.
again,
he
gives
it
some
value.
he
must
give
it
some
value,
and
if
it
is
purely
a
swearing
contest,
he
has
abused
his
discretion
in
either
not
affirming
the
magistrate's
evaluation
or
in
rehearing
the
testimony.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
only
he
gives
it
whatever
it
is
worth,
and
he
need
not
give
it
any
deference,
but
he
can.
he
can
always
choose
to
rehear
the
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
doesn't
give
deference
to
the
magistrate
insofar
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
but
then
he
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
gives
it
for
what
it
is
worth.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
if
he
wishes
to
make
it
so,
otherwise
he
would
rehear
the
testimony
if
he
doesn't
think
that
the
magistrate's
determination,
he
doesn't
trust
it,
he
thinks
the
evidence
is
truly
equipoise.
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
case
and
again
the
district
court
affirmed
the
magistrate's
findings.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
whatever
the
dictionary
meaning
is,
it
is
quite
clear
here
what
congress
had
in
mind,
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
anew
i
think
it
means
and
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
he
gives
it
a
fresh
look,
and
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
starts
by
reviewing
everything
and
then
he
can
give
credit
to
what
he
thinks
deserves
credit,
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
decision
in
campbell
on
which
de
novo
is
taken
from
show
quite
clearly
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
it
is
a
thorough
review
which
he
doesn't
have
to
give
deference
as
compared
to
subsection
(a)
where
he
has
to
give
clearly
erroneous
deference
to
the
magistrate's
findings.
thank
you.
