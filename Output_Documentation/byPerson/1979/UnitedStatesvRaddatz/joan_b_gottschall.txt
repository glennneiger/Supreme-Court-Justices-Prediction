ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
government
stated
this
morning,
the
magistrates
act
not
only
withholds
from
the
magistrate
decision-making
power
with
respect
to
case
dispositive
motions,
but
it
expressly
provides
that
if
any
party
objects
to
any
finding
or
any
recommendation
of
the
magistrate
"a
judge
of
the
court
shall
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
those
portions
of
the
report
or
specified
proposed
findings
to
which
objection
is
made."
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
the
district
judge
is
in
a
position
to
make
an
independent
determination.
if
all
the
district
judge
does
is
looks
at
what
the
magistrate
has
done
and
says,
well,
this
is
a
credibility
finding,
i
obviously
don't
have
the
evidence
before
me
to
reevaluate
that,
i
don't
see
how
that
can
possibly
be
explained
as
any
kind
of
a
de
novo
determination
of
anything,
and
i
think
that
is
the
difference
between
what
the
court
of
appeals
felt
and
the
position
that
the
government
is
urging
now.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
difference,
and
i
think
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
established
that
very
clearly.
first
of
all,
let
me
just
point
out
that
this
act
does
not
use
the
word
hearing
the
way
the
government
suggests,
that
is
an
evidentiary
hearing.
this
act
speaks
of
hearing
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
motions
to
dismiss
complaints
and
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
not
evidentiary.
and
this
court,
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
first
city
national
bank,
had
virtually
an
identical
argument
before
it,
where
a
party
claimed
that
because
a
statute
spoke
of
de
novo
review
rather
than
trial
de
novo
that
there
was
to
be
more
limited
judicial
review,
and
the
court
rejected
that.
it
said
that
the
critical
concept
is
de
novo
and
what
de
novo
means
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
independent
determination
of
the
issue.
and
i
would
just
suggest
that
in
many
decisions
of
this
court,
virtually
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
talk
about
de
novo,
all
of
these
terms
are
used
interchangeably.
i
think
this
is
quite
clearly
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
what
it
appears
that
the
act
contemplated
was
that
the
district
judge
would
be
able
to
evaluate
on
what
issues
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
rehear
evidence
in
order
to
make
a
de
novo
determination.
now,
the
case
is
established
that
one
of
those
issues
is
credibility.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
wouldn't
it
end
up
in
a
new
hearing?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
as
to
credibility
questions,
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
what
good
is
sending
out
the
magistrate
if
he
is
going
to
have
two
hearings?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
the
statute
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
do
you
think
congress
meant
to
establish
another
hearing,
an
extra
hearing?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
what
i
believe
the
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
take
some
of
these
motions
away
from
district
judges
to
the
extent
possible,
while
preserving
the
district
judge's
ability
to
make
a
decision
of
those
issues.
and
i
think
that
the
suggestion
that
the
statute
is
rendered
useless
because
in
cases
where
credibility
was
critical
or
some
other
source
of
evidence
that
wasn't
included
in
the
record
required
rehearing,
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
i
would
expect
that
there
area
great
many
matters
where
if
there
is
an
initial
hearing
before
a
judicial
magistrate,
there
can
be
a
stipulated
record
developed,
a
question
of
law
can
surface,
and
many
different
things
can
happen
that
will
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
to
rehear
the
evidence.
i
would
suggest
that
a
real
swearing
contest
such
as
occurred
in
this
case
is
really
rather
unusual.
perhaps
not
in
confession
cases
--
the
court
has
noted
the
confession
cases
typically
involve
this
kind
of
thing,
but
in
all
the
great
variety
of
matters
that
are
covered
by
section
636(b)(1)(b),
i
would
expect
that
credibility
would
not
be
the
critical
issue
in
that
many
cases.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
think
it
would
be
uniformly.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
that
would
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
i
think
it
may
be
a
different
question
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
there
is
a
different
kind
of
credibility
question
i
would
think
in
fourth
amendment
cases,
in
the
generality
of
cases.
in
general,
there
would
be
one
probably
police
officers
testifying
as
to
perhaps
articulable
facts
that
they
observed
that
they
contend
amounted
to
probable
cause
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
many
or
what
percentage
of
fourth
amendment
suppression
motions
would
raise
this
kind
of
credibility
question.
it
may
be
that
suppression
motions
do
raise
credibility
questions
in
the
majority
of
cases.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
would
think
that
is
right
because
in
that
situation
the
independence
of
a
decision-maker
is
critically
important.
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
credibility
findings
and
findings
of
fact
in
which
credibility
figured
were
very
clearly
covered
by
the
de
novo
review
provision.
there
is
really
no
question
on
the
basis
of
this
legislative
history
that
congress
contemplated
that
credibility
issues
would
be
redetermined
just
like
any
other
issues,
that
any
finding
of
fact
of
the
magistrate
would
be
subject
to
this
de
novo
review
provision.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
there
are
two
questions,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
question
is
the
standard
of
review
when
a
finding
is
objected
to,
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
conflict
between
the
parties
in
this
case
that
the
judge
is
supposed
to
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
issue.
the
government
states
in
its
brief
that
the
judge
would
be
violating
the
statue
if
he
deferred
to
the
magistrate
on
fact-findings.
so
i
think
on
that
point
there
is
agreement.
the
problem
arises
on
the
question
of
what
procedures
the
judge
has
to
follow
in
evaluating
the
magistrate's
recommendations.
and
what
the
legislative
history
says,
it
is
true
that
the
statement
that
the
government
has
quoted
consistently
in
its
brief,
the
use
of
the
words
de
novo
determination
is
not
intended
to
require
the
judge
to
actually
conduct
a
new
hearing
on
contested
issues,
that
is
true.
but
the
government
consistently
omits
the
two
explanatory
sentences
which
follow,
which
state
that
normally
the
judge
upon
application
would
consider
the
record
which
has
been
developed
before
the
magistrate
and
make
his
own
determination
on
the
basis
of
that
record.
but
in
some
specific
instances,
however,
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
judge
to
modify
or
reject
the
findings
of
the
magistrate,
take
additional
evidence,
to
recall
witnesses
or
to
recommit
the
matter
to
the
magistrate
for
further
proceedings.
there
is
no
question
that
congress
contemplated
that
rehearing
would
be
necessary
in
some
cases.
and
from
the
cases
that
congress
cited
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
the
government
seems
to
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
the
government
suggests
though
a
completely
unreviewable
standard
of
discretion,
that
whether
the
judge
decides
to
hear
evidence
or
decides
not
to
hear
evidence
is
completely
unreviewable.
it
depends
on
how
the
judge
feels
that
particular
day.
that
can't
possibly
be
the
law.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
judge
has
to
put
himself
in
a
position
where
he
can
fulfill
the
statutory
requirement
that
he
make
a
de
novo
determination.
the
government's
argument
is
basically
saying
that
all
the
process
that
an
objecting
party
is
entitled
to
is
to
have
the
magistrate
affirm.
if
you
objected
to
the
magistrate's
findings
and
if
the
judge
affirmed
the
magistrate,
there
would
be
no
problem.
but
if
you
objected
to
the
magistrate's
findings
and
the
district
judge
reversed
the
magistrate,
well
then
there
would
be
due
process
constraints
on
that
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
absolutely
not.
i
think
that
that
case
is
covered
by
this
court's
decision
in
matthews
v.
weber,
where
the
parties
can
focus
the
judge's
attention
on
the
problems
that
they
have
with
the
magistrate's
recommendation
and
the
judge
can
go
to
the
record
and
he
has
the
evidence
before
him,
it
was
before
the
magistrate,
and
with
the
guidance
of
the
parties
he
can
make
an
independent
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
magistrate
was
correct.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
problem.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
on
affidavits?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
no,
i
don't
think
the
law
would
permit
that
at
all,
i
think
that
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
that's
correct.
no,
that
is
contrary
to
the
whole
notion
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
which
our
response
is
to
the
same
concerns
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
worried
about
here,
making
credibility
determinations
on
the
basis
of
cold
records.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
the
government
seems
--
it
appears
to
me
that
what
the
government
is
suggesting
is
something
like
a
substantial
evidence
standard,
which
this
court
has
always
said
is
equivalent
to
record
review.
if
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
issues,
all
the
judge
does
is
look
at
the
record,
and
really
what
the
judge
is
doing
is
simply
making
sure
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
magistrate's
conclusion.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
district
judge
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
that's
right.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
if
there
is
a
testimonial
conflict
and
credibility
is
--
if
there
were
some
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
that
the
court
has
to
make
its
own
determination,
although
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
that
whether
what
the
judge
does,
whether
it
is
permissible
under
established
principles
of
due
process
and
fair
procedure
depends
on
whether
the
judge
has
an
adequate
basis
beforehand
for
making
the
decision,
and
that
depends
on
the
importance
of
issues
such
as
credibility
and
basically
on
the
state
of
the
record
and
what
kinds
of
issues
it
is
that
he
is
evaluating.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
if
the
judge
believes
that
it
will
assist
him
in
the
disposition
of
the
cases,
can
send
anything
under
section
636
to
a
magistrate.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
with
respect
to
any
findings
to
which
objections
are
made
and
to
the
extend
credibility
or
some
issue
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
on
a
matter
of
credibility,
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
point
out
that
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
frankly
don't
know
how
this
comes
out
in
the
generality
of
cases.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
that
is
correct,
for
this
reason.
in
a
criminal
case,
largely
because
of
the
discovery
rules
and
a
lot
of
other
factors,
the
fact
is
that
the
parties
do
not
know
what
the
testimony
is
going
to
be
at
the
suppression
hearing
before
they
hear
it.
and
in
many
suppression
hearings
that
i
have
been
involved
in
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
to
the
admission
of
the
evidence.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
i
expected
that
credibility
would
be
an
issue
in
this
case
and
i
told
that
to
the
district
judge.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
in
this
case
i
think
it
clearly
would
have
been
better.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
congress
has
made
a
policy
decision
in
the
area
of
case
dispositive
motions
that
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
i
think
the
constitution
may
put
some
restraints
on
that.
when
you
are
talking
about
case
dispositive
motions
and
an
article
3
court
and
an
issue
arising
directly
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
i
don't
think
the
issue
has
to
be
reached
in
this
case
because
of
the
de
novo
determination
requirement,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
may
be
constraints
on
the
power
of
congress.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
would.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i'm
not
entirely
certain
that
the
issues,
all
of
the
issues
in
this
case
at
the
suppression
motion
could
have
been
tried
before
the
jury,
and
certainly
the
decision
of
the
jury
would
not
be
the
decision
that
the
law
on
the
firth
amendment
itself
in
fact
requires
the
judge
to
make
in
this
case.
it
would
have
been
a
different
decision
with
different
factors
being
important.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
under
the
rules
my
understanding
is
that
once
the
pretrial
motion
has
been
decided
adversely,
there
is
no
need
to
make
an
objection
and
that
is
the
end
of
it,
it
is
the
law
of
the
case.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
one
might
be
able
to.
you
might
be
permitted
to
do
it,
but
you
certainly
don't
have
to
do
it.
and
if
you
were
permitted
to
do
it,
you
would
be
doing
something
somewhat
different
from
what
you
are
doing
in
a
pretrial
hearing.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
on
the
issue
of
reliability.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i've
seen
cases
going
both
ways
on
that
question
in
terms
of
the
legal
standard.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i'm
not
sure,
i
can't
really
think
of
any
case.
it
wasn't
my
understanding
that
i
would
be
allowed
to
relitigate
the
constitutional
question
apart
from
questions
of
reliability,
the
precise
issue
that
the
law
required
me
to
make
as
a
pretrial
again.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
may
not
be
correct
on
that.
that
has
been
my
understanding.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well,
as
i
say,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
law
is.
at
least
in
some
form
i
suspect
i
could
have
submitted
that
question
to
the
jury,
but
that
certainly
would
not
serve
the
interests
of
the
government
that
it
is
putting
forth
in
its
case.
if
in
order
to
have
an
article
3
judge
hear
the
evidence
relevant
to
the
fifth
amendment
issue
i
have
to
take
a
jury
trial,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
probably
as
counter-productive
of
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
think
that
submitting
the
issue
of
voluntariness
to
the
trial
jury
would
be
a
satisfactory
determination
of
the
question
of
voluntariness
under
this
court's
decisions.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
my
understanding
of
jackson
v.
denno
is
that
it
entitles
the
defendant
to
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
trial
jury
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
so
i
don't
think
that
submitting
that
issue
to
the
trial
jury
would
be
of
consequence
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
an
adequate
determination
of
the
voluntariness
question
itself.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes,
your
honor,
he
may.
once
he
has
decided
that
it
is
admissible,
then
he
is
permitted
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes,
i
believe
that
is
right.
i
am
still
not
entirely
convinced
that
all
of
the
evidence
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
employed
on
the
pretrial
hearing
would
be
properly
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
certainly
in
some
jurisdictions
i
understand
that
to
be
true.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
that
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
civil
and
motions
related
to
criminal
cases,
like
suppression
motions,
would
depend
on
whether
one
were
to
analyze
this
problem
as
a
matter
of
a
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
de
novo
determinations
problem.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
perhaps
not
under
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
--
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
importance
of
demeanor
evidence
in
making
credibility
determinations
is
so
much
a
part
of
all
judicial
process,
whether
it
be
criminal
or
civil,
that
while
the
interests
at
stake
might
not
be
as
critical
in
say
the
preliminary
injunction
context,
that
that
principle
about
demeanor
evidence
would
probably
make
this
holding
in
the
extent
of
that
context.
it
would
be
a
slightly
different
analysis.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
i
don't
remember,
it
must
have
been
but
i
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
that
that
is
the
clearest
case.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
that
in,
for
instance,
the
fourth
amendment
context
which
mr.
chief
justice
burger
mentioned,
the
analysis
might
be
different.
for
instance,
in
the
summary
judgment
context,
in
considering
for
instance
summary
judgment
in
a
case
that
was
going
to
be
tried
to
the
bench
rather
than
to
a
jury,
so
they
weren't
jury
trial
issues,
the
judge
would
have
somewhat
more
latitude
in
resolving
factual
questions
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
than
he
would
in
some
other
context.
so
whether,
for
instance,
if
at
the
hearing
before
the
magistrate
there
was
no
conflicting
testimony
but
there
was
a
question
of
credibility,
perhaps
then
a
determination
of
which
party
had
the
burden
might
be
relevant.
i
think
that
that
gets
into
a
much
more
complicated
situation.
but
certainly
where
there
is
a
swearing
contest,
the
trial
judge
had
no
reasonable
basis
for
making
a
de
novo
decision
of
the
factual
matters,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion.
the
seventh
circuit
read
the
record
and
their
conclusion
was
that
it
was
simply
impossible
to
determine
the
truth
from
that
written
record.
the
evidence
was
simply
too
conflicting
and
too
inconsistent.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
are
appointed
by
the
judges
of
the
district
court,
by
a
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court.
the
offices
i
believe
are
established
by
the
judicial
conference
and
their
terms
are
eight-year
terms.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
they
are
removable
for
a
range
of
reasons,
including
incompetence,
neglect
of
duty
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
that's
correct,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
hearing
i
think
before
they
are
removed.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
my
understanding
of
those
statutes
is
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
the
trial
again
in
the
higher
level
court,
that
it
isn't
a
record
review
but
it
is
a
relitigation
of
the
issues.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
there
is
de
novo
language
in
old
statutes
and
old
cases
that
indicate
that
what
de
novo
means
is
to
begin
from
scratch
and
do
it
all
again,
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened.
the
more
recent
federal
authorities
seem
to
be
working
on
some
standard
for
de
novo
which
give
more
play
to
the
possibility
of
eliminating
some
issues
than
those
old
cases
did.
we
could
have
argued
that
the
judge
was
required
to
redo
it.
it
seemed
that
in
view
of
the
purposes
of
the
legislation
and
the
statements
in
the
congressional
history
that
the
proper
approach
was
the
approach
taken
by
some
of
these
recent
federal
decisions
which
indicate
that
de
novo
requires
reconsideration
of
live
evidence
only
to
the
extent
that
issues
like
credibility,
motivation,
veracity
and
those
kinds
of
issues
were
present.
apart
from
that,
the
district
judge
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
to
try
to
work
out
stipulations,
to
admit
the
prior
record,
and
engage
in
a
number
of
duplication-saving
devices
as
long
as
he
puts
himself
in
a
position
to
make
a
truly
independent
decision
on
the
credibility
questions.
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
minute,
because
i
think
that
the
government's
position
comes
down
largely
to
the
question
of
the
costs
of
rehearing
and
the
costs
in
terms
of
economic
and
administrative
considerations
of,
number
one,
not
sending
the
motions
to
suppress
to
magistrates
and,
number
two,
requiring
the
judge
to
hear
selected
evidence
rather
than
reading
the
transcript.
we
have
included
in
our
brief
some
recent
statistics
that
indicate
that
the
whole
issue
of
suppression
motions,
the
hearing
of
suppression
motions
are
not
in
any
event
a
very
substantial
part
of
the
workload
of
district
judges
or
magistrates.
but
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
answer
to
that
argument
is
the
docket
sheet
in
this
case.
the
government
says
that
the
interests
of
judicial
efficiency
has
been
saved
by
this
procedure.
well,
all
there
was
was
a
reading
of
the
record.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
this
motion
to
suppress
would
in
all
likelihood
have
been
heard
by
a
district
judge
in
a
day
and
ruled
on
from
the
bench.
what
in
fact
happened
was
that
it
took
five
months,
and
the
reason
it
took
five
months
was
because
first
the
magistrate
had
to
hold
a
hearing
and
then
a
transcript
had
to
be
prepared,
which
is
not
that
common
in
most
motions
to
suppress
that
i
have
been
involved
in
if
there
is
not
going
to
be
an
appeal.
the
parties,
the
lawyers,
both
of
whom
were
government
lawyers,
had
to
prepare
proposed
factfindings
and
recommendations,
the
magistrate
had
to
review
all
of
this
material
and
write
a
report
to
the
district
judge
with
proposed
fact-findings,
the
parties
had
to
file
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report,
the
district
judge
had
to
read
all
of
this
record
which
by
this
time
included
a
voluminous
transcript,
presumably
in
many
cases
he
would
hear
oral
argument
and
then
he
had
to
go
about
the
process
of
trying
to
decide
from
the
transcript
with
all
this
conflicting
testimony
what
in
fact
happened.
now,
if
any
time
were
to
be
saved
by
having
the
district
judge
rehear
selected
testimony
rather
than
reading
this
transcript.
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
a
very
minimal
savings
at
best.
and
we
have
included
in
our
brief
some
references
to
some
recent
congressional
hearings
in
which
district
judges
have
begged
congress
not
to
give
them
appellate-type
duties
with
respect
to
magistrate
civil
trial
jurisdiction
because
they
find
that
it
is
quicker
for
them
to
hear
the
issues
again
rather
than
reading
through
a
transcript.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
well
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
--
if
he
thought
it
would
save
time,
he
could
have,
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
yes.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
as
to
why
he
sent
it
to
the
magistrate?
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
don't
know.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
in
reality
that
is
true.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
the
government
--
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
no,
he
had
the
power
to
send
it
to
the
magistrate,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
i
think
when
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
whether
rehearing
selected
testimony
is
going
to
frustrate
the
purposes
of
this
legislation,
it
has
got
to
be
considered
in
reference
to
the
alternative
and
what
the
alternative
is,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
alternative
is
reading
a
transcript.
the
ninth
circuit's
alternative
is
that
a
tape
recording
has
to
be
prepared.
as
i
understand
it,
the
sixth
circuit
still
holds
to
its
old
wedding
v.
wingo
rules
which
still
represent
the
condition
they
were
in
at
the
time
of
wingo
v.
wedding,
that
a
tape
recording
has
to
be
prepared.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
the
most
recent
discussion
of
that
was
in
the
orand
case
which
the
government
has
cited
in
its
brief,
and
the
--
i
think
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
situation,
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
stating
that
in
that
case
he
hadn't
even
had
a
transcript.
the
ninth
circuit
noted
that
he
also
hadn't
had
a
tape
recording
which
was
still
the
prevailing
law
of
the
circuit,
and
that
it
was
remanded
for
him
to
reconsider
whether
he
ought
to
have
a
tape
recording.
they
cited
campbell,
they
cited
this
case,
so
i
don't
think
the
requirements
are
really
fixed
yet.
but
it
is
obvious
under
the
statute
that
something
has
to
be
written
in
so
that
the
judge
has
some
basis
for
making
his
decision.
ms.
joan
b.
gottschall
thank
you.
