justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
you
have
been
asked
questions
about
civil
cases,
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
you
draw
a
distinction
at
all
between
civil
and
criminal
cases.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
think
in
terms
of
due
process.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
is
your
submission
as
to
criminal
cases
limited
to
situations
where
there
is
what
we
have
been
calling
a
swearing
contest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
