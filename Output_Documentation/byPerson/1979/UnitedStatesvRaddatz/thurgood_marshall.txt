justice
thurgood
marshall
we
realize
that
in
some
cases
a
motion
to
suppress
is
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
how
many
narcotics
cases
go
to
trial
after
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
fair
number,
about
80
or
90.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
to
have
a
whole
new
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
can
send
it
to
a
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
there
is
any
conflict
he
has
to
try
it
all
over
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
thing
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
getting
two
hearings
is
not
to
object?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
many
hearings
that
credibility
isn't
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
would
help
you
if
you
don't
need
a
hearing.
if
there
is
not
going
to
be
disagreement,
you
don't
need
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did
object.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
object?
you
didn't
know
but
you
objected?
you
must
have
know
something
because
you
objected.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
you
objected
to
it
being
referred
to
the
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
knew
about
credibility,
so
why
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
just
have
the
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
is
really
what
you
are
against,
the
magistrate,
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
congress
has
overruled
you,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
else
can
make
that
decision
other
than
congress?
who
else
can
make
the
decision
as
to
the
judicial
process
in
this
country
other
than
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
judge
didn't
have
to
send
this
to
a
magistrate.
if
he
wanted
to
save
time,
he
could
have
tried
it,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
he
could
have
taken
it
himself
and
saved,
what,
five
months?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
this
case
--
in
this
case,
if
the
judge
had
tried
the
motion
to
suppress
without
the
magistrate,
he
would
have
saved
a
whole
lot
of
time,
you
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what?
he
didn't,
and
it
was
up
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
an
error,
was
it,
to
send
it
to
the
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
could
have
decided
not
to
send
it.
