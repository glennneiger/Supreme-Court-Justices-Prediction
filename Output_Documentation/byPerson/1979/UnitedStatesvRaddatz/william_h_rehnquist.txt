justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levander,
what
if
after
the
denial
of
the
suppression
motion
but
at
the
point
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
where
the
government
sought
to
introduce
the
confession,
the
defendant
had
objected
and
said
under
jackson
v.
denno,
an
opinion
of
this
court,
i
am
entitled
to
the
judge's
determination
as
to
whether
it
is
voluntary
or
nog
before
it
goes
to
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
how
lots
of
trials
are
conducted
nowadays,
because
the
defendants
don't
have
any
defense
if
they
lose
their
suppression
motion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
let's
suppose
we
are
talking
about
a
defendant
who
really
did
have
a
defense
and
had
an
argument
to
make,
not
only
his
confession
was
involuntary
but
he
had
witnesses
to
put
on
and
an
alibi
and
that
sort
of
thing,
do
you
think
that
the
district
judge
would
have
been
required
under
those
circumstances,
when
the
confession
was
offered
at
trial,
to
conduct
a
hearing
and
listen
in
person
to
the
suppression
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
exactly
what
he
got
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
say
he
has
already
gotten
everything
that
jackson
got?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
somehow
a
magistrate
is
more
impartial
and
more
neutral
than
a
jury
in
making
that
sort
of
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
claim
in
most
proceedings
that
juries
have
misbehaved
either,
and
yet
jackson
v.
denno
says
you
can't
submit
a
confession
to
them
without
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
presumably
is
not
a
neutral
fact-finder?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
not
on
the
testimony
of
the
suppression
motion
but
just
after
the
motions
made
a
regular
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
and
a
question
was
raised
as
to
the
admissibility
of
a
point
of
evidence
which
required
a
determination
by
the
judge
as
to
whether
the
evidence
was
admissible,
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
permissible
for
him
to
say,
well,
you
present
this
testimony
to
a
magistrate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
not
difficult
under
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
makes
no
distinction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
de
novo
doesn't
--
doesn't
de
novo
ordinarily
mean
you
are
privileged
to
submit
additional
evidence
to
the
reviewer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
they
use
the
words
de
novo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
have
reached
almost
the
opposite
conclusion
from
hearing
the
government's
argument
that
the
statutory
language
probably
is
in
your
favor,
but
that
the
legislative
history
is
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
say
the
magistrate
granting
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
you
don't
have
those
in
criminal
cases,
but
suppose
in
a
civil
case,
and
it
comes
before
the
district
court,
do
you
say
that
the
judge
--
there
are
affidavits
on
both
sides
so
you
call
it
a
swearing
contest,
do
you
say
the
district
judge
must
as
a
matter
of
law
under
this
act
hear
the
witnesses
or
at
least
read
the
affidavits
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
the
district
court
has
denied
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
saying
there
is
a
credibility
issue
here,
i
can't
tell
which
of
the
parties
is
telling
the
truth,
do
you
think
the
district
court
could
reverse
that
and
say
i
have
determined
that
one
of
the
parties
is
telling
the
truth
and
the
other
isn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
is
being
sent
to
jail
as
a
result
of
the
magistrate's
denial
of
the
suppression
here,
this
suppression
motion.
it
required
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
to
forego
a
trial
in
order
to
have
the
magistrate's
hearing
become
what
was
in
effect
the
trial
record,
did
it
not?
had
you
been
dissatisfied
with
the
magistrate's
ruling
on
the
suppression
motion
and
the
district
court's
affirmance
of
it,
you
could
have
gone
ahead
and
had
a
full-scale
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
not
stipulated
and
the
time
came
during
the
trial
that
the
confession
is
offered
in
evidence?
you
certainly
would
have
objected,
would
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
object
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
it
may
not
serve
the
interests
of
the
government,
it
would
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jackson
v.
denno
says
maybe
you
have
to
submit
it
to
the
trial
judge,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
rely
on
chief
justice
hugh's
language
in
the
first
oregon
case
which
of
course
wasn't
a
simple
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
count
on
me
for
being
infallible.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
to
a
state
proceeding
which
originally
went
before
a
jp,
tried
by
him
and
the
state
statute
provided
for
a
de
novo
review
by
the
superior
court
of
the
circuit
or
whatever
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
here
you
fell
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
have
the
trial
--
