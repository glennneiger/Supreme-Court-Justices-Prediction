chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
79-8,
united
states
v.
raddatz.
mr.
levander,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on,
is
there
anything
final
about
the
magistrate's
recommendation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
a
special
reason
for
that,
for
perhaps
he
would
include
among
the
witnesses
on
the
contempt
matter
the
testimony
of
the
magistrate
himself
or
herself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
suggesting
that
in
a
jury
trial
a
judge
could
stop
the
trial
and
refer
something
to
a
magistrate
after
the
trial
has
commenced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
doesn't
permit
him
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levander,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
we
hinted
if
we
have
not
held
that
credibility
findings
are
rarely
if
ever
to
be
reviewed
on
a
cold
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
to
reverse
them,
on
the
hypothetical
that
justice
stevens
has
just
posed.
is
it
not
one
thing
to
affirm
credibility
findings
on
a
cold
record
and
quite
another
to
reverse
them
on
a
cold
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
believes
that
the
trier
of
facts
disbelieve,
is
that
the
kind
of
a
case
you
are
posing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
test
that
out
with
this
hypothetical.
suppose
the
magistrate
made
careful
and
detailed
findings
that
he
believed
the
defendant
and
disbelieved
the
officers
and
therefore
recommended
the
suppression
of
the
testimony.
now,
the
district
judge
reading
the
record
and
nothing
more
reverses
the
district
judge
on
the
credibility
finding,
do
you
mean
that
would
give
rise
to
due
process
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don't
you
take
into
account
the
difference
between
findings
of
fact
generally
and
findings
of
fact
based
entirely
on
credibility
of
the
speaker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
gottschall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
laying
aside
for
a
moment
what
differences
if
any
there
may
be
between
de
novo
determination
and
a
de
novo
hearing,
would
you
--
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
district
judge
affirming
a
magistrate's
finding
on
credibility
and
reversing
a
finding
on
credibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
is
the
difference
between
a
de
novo
determination
and
a
de
novo
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
suppression
of
tangible
evidence
cases,
do
you
say
it
would
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
uniformly
but
overwhelmingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
contests
of
credibility.
i
say
that
on
the
basis
of
having
reviewed
almost
literally
thousands
of
records
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
when
the
court
of
appeals
had
general
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
it
makes
a
difference,
but
i
think
your
statement
of
the
fact
is
not
based
on
--
not
consistent
with
my
observations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
evidence
was
in
plain
sight
and
the
defendant
says
no,
it
was
not
in
plain
sight,
it
was
in
his
back
pocket,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
isn't
that
typical
of
the
type
of
evidence
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
well
argue
that
if
in
fact
they
are
overwhelmingly
credibility
contests,
that
is
the
reason
for
an
article
3
judge
to
hear
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
also
conceded
that
if
a
judge,
a
district
judge
reversed
a
credibility
finding,
it
might
--
i
don't
think
he
conceded
it
would,
but
it
might
well
give
rise
to
serious
due
process
questions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judge
may
then
submit
it,
allow
it
to
go
to
the
jury
if
he
makes
the
appropriate
findings
under
jackson
v.
denno,
may
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
the
ninth
circuit
requires
the
district
judge
to
listen
to
the
tape
record
or
that
one
be
prepared?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
something
further,
mr.
levander?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
