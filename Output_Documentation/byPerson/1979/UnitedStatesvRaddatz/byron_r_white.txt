justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
suppose
--
what
happens
under
the
federal
procedure
now
in
the
federal
court?
the
evidence
as
to
the
--
if
it
is
jury
trial,
the
evidence
as
to
voluntariness
goes
to
the
jury,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
function
of
the
hearing
in
the
federal
system
is
to
make
sure
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
hear
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
can
reject
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
in
those
--
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
the
district
judge
has
more
than
two
choices.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
hold
a
hearing
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
he
can
accept
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can
hold
a
hearing
himself
if
he
thinks
--
if
someone
convinces
him
that
he
really
ought
to
hear
the
witnesses
himself
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
can
hear
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
doesn't
contend
otherwise,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
specifically
if
that
was
one
of
the
options
that
was
open
to
the
judge,
and
the
government
said
yes,
that
occasionally
he
would
have
a
hearing
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
permitted
the
magistrate
or
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
government
doesn't
argue
that
whatever
judgment
the
district
judge
makes
of
the
magistrate's
findings
isn't
subject
to
review,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
judge
says
i've
read
the
record,
i've
read
the
written
record,
the
record
of
the
evidence,
and
i
make
my
own
determination
as
follows,
and
it
just
so
happens
that
every
determination
agrees
with
the
magistrate.
that
wouldn't
satisfy
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
let's
assume
there
that
there
are
square
conflicts
in
the
evidence
or
in
the
testimony
before
the
master.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
process
wouldn't
satisfy
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
that
the
judge
must
call
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
government
was
saying
that
--
the
government
doesn't
urge
that
the
court
is
free
not
to
make
its
own
determination,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
reads
the
record
and
makes
its
determinations
and
if
there
is
a
conflict
it
resolves
them
itself,
and
if
it
disagrees
with
the
magistrate
it
disagrees,
and
if
it
agrees
it
agrees
with
the
magistrate.
and
if
it
wanted
to
it
could
have
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
congress
had
expressly
said
that
magistrates
will
make
findings
of
fact
and
resolve
issues
turning
on
credibility
and
that
the
district
judge
shall
accept
them
if
they
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
would
you
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
issue
of
--
was
it
a
voluntariness
question,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
are
entitled
to
have
that
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
voluntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
seen
one
where
it
is
denied
if
you
ask
or
request
to
put
on
evidence
about
the
voluntariness
issue
before
the
jury
and
have
the
judge
instruct
on
it
in
the
federal
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
authority
do
you
have
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
jackson
v.
denno
said
the
judge
had
to
make
an
initial
determination
and
that
many
jurisdictions,
including
the
federal,
permitted
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
congressional,
that
is
jackson
v.
denno.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
some
jurisdictions,
and
i
think
the
federal,
if
the
defendant
wants
he
can
have
the
issue
of
voluntariness
resubmitted
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
gottschall,
i
might
add
that
after
looking
at
the
cases
i
am
just
not
sure
what
the
rule
is
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
resubmission
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury,
so
i
may
have
over-spoken.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
after
the
judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
statute
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
jackson
v.
denno?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
codified
the
massachusetts
procedure
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
didn't
over-speak
myself.
