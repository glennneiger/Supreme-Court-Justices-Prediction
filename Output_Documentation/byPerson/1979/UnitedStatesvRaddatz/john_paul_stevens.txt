justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
there
isn't
conflicting
testimony,
in
a
sense
questions
of
credibility
are
almost
always
at
issue,
aren't
they,
to
the
extent
that
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
has
the
right
to
ignore
uncontradicted
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
really
be
in
every
case,
although
it
would
be
most
cases
because
i
suppose
the
parties
could
stipulate
that
they
would
accept
the
determination
of
the
magistrate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
supposing
the
magistrate
had
decided
the
other
way
and
on
review,
that
is
had
held
that
the
statement
should
be
suppressed,
and
on
review
at
the
instance
of
the
government,
without
taking
any
additional
evidence,
the
court
had
overruled
that
determination,
would
you
say
it
still
would
be
just
a
--
there
would
be
no
purpose
to
having
--
then
would
you
say
the
standard
didn't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
do
it
without
taking
any
additional
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
the
defendant
really
doesn't
get
hurt
by
the
court
of
appeals
position
but
he
might
be
hurt
if
it
had
gone
the
other
way
for
the
magistrate,
is
what
i
am
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
view
of
the
procedure
--
now
you
are
saying
he
doesn't
have
standing
to
make
this
argument,
and
i
have
to
think
that
through
--
but
your
view
of
the
procedure
is
that
even
if
it
is
a
swearing
contest
between
the
officer
and
the
defendant,
the
district
judge
may
nevertheless
in
its
so-called
de
novo
review
reverse
the
finding
of
the
magistrate
without
hearing
any
additional
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
you
say
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
he
would
probably
have
to
do
that.
what
would
require
him
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
require
him
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
about
what
judge
sprecher
said
this
case
was,
that
you
have
a
credibility
determination
and
therefore
due
process
requires
the
judge
hear
the
evidence
himself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
that
they
are
affirming
instead
of
reversing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
says
on
the
review,
well,
i
really
can't
tell
because
you've
got
a
swearing
contest
here,
but
even
though
the
statute
directs
me
to
give
a
de
novo
hearing,
there
is
really
no
way
to
do
it
but
i
will
just
assume
they
are
probably
right.
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
the
words
de
novo
determination
mean
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levander,
none
of
those
cases
are
cases
in
which
the
court
is
directed
to
make
a
de
novo
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
judge
sprecher's
argument
to
be
that
when
a
de
novo
determination
must
be
made
and
credibility
is
an
issue,
that
then
due
process
requires
that
the
witnesses
be
heard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
that
point
of
affirming
versus
reversing,
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
suggest
that
in
making
the
de
novo
determination
the
judge
may
give
some
deference
to
the
views
of
the
magistrate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
means
he
may
give
some
deference
to
it,
so
it
is
not
really
a
hundred
percent
de
novo,
it
is
like
99.5
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
his
thorough
review
is
that
the
evidence
is
in
conflict,
it
depends
on
whether
i
believe
(a)
or
(b),
i
really
don't
know
without
seeing
them,
so
the
only
thing
i
can
go
on
is
that
the
magistrate
believed
(a).
can
he
affirm
on
that
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
can
give
some
deference
to
the
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
a
hundred
percent
de
novo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
be
50-50.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
like
you
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
either
event,
the
words
de
novo
mean
he
must
give
some
deference
to
the
magistrate
under
your
view,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
can,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
mandatory
--
it
says
he
shall
make
a
de
novo
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
mean
to
me
that
he
has
to
do
it.
and
if
you
are
saying
that
he
may
give
deference
to
the
magistrate,
it
is
not
a
100
percent
de
novo
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
can
affirm
but
he
can't
reverse,
if
the
evidence
is
evenly
balanced.
that
is
what
you
told
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
only
difference
between
the
cases
of
affirming
and
reversing
is
that
in
one
case
he
gives
deference
to
the
magistrate
and
in
the
other
he
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
worth
something,
that
is
what
it
is
worth.
but
your
position
is
that
it
is
worth
something.
