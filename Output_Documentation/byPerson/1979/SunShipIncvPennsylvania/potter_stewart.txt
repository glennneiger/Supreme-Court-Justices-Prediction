you
have
told
us
that
in
this
case,
it's
conceded
that
the
--
that
the
respondents
were
within
the
coverage
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
location
of
their
injuries
as
well
as
their
status.
there
might
be
questions
under
--
in
some
situations,
might
there
not,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
statute
did
cover?
justice
potter
stewart
about
--
that
it's
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
wherever
the
line
may
be
under
--
there
--
there's
going
to
be
a
twilight
zone,
i
suppose.
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
still
is
a
line.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
it's
not
--
it
won't
always
be
a
clear
line.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
if
--
if
you
should
be
correct
and
if
an
injured
workman
or
the
survivors
of
a
deceased
workman
that
was
killed
honestly
believe
that
they're
under
the
coverage
of
the
federal
statute.
and
if
you're
--
if
we
decide
this
case
in
your
favor
and
say
the
federal
statute
is
exclusive
and
then
the
federal
administrative
agency
upheld
by
the
court
said,
“sorry,
you're
not
covered.”
will
the
--
will
the
statute
of
limitations
have
run
so
far
as
the
state
workmen's
compensation
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
they
do,
but
i
gather
some
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
nature
of
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
constitution
continues,
i
suppose,
to
impose
a
limit
upon
the
exertion
of
state
power
over
--
over
accidents
or
deaths
that
occur
at
sea.
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
or
navigable
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
jensen
case
has
not
been
overruled
ever
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
quite
powerful
whether
or
not
congress
has
moved
in
the
states,
there's
a
constitutional
limit
upon
the
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction
over
navigable
waters,
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
jensen
line.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hayes,
just
one
question.
mr.
lurie
stated
that
your
client
had
failed
to
secure
payments
of
compensation
as
required
by
the
federal
law
and
that
therefore,
his
clients
could've
had
their
option
if
sued
you
at
common
law
or
an
admiralty
law.
is
that
correct,
factually?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
