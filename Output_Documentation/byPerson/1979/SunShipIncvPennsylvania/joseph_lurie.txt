mr.
joseph
lurie
mr.
chief
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
workmen's
compensation
act
is
not
administered
by
any
state.
it's
not
administered
by
the
federal
government,
the
longshoreman
harbor
worker's
compensation.
ever
state's
workmen's
compensation
act
perhaps
except
ohio
which
they
have
a
state
system,
as
well
as
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
is
administered
by
the
employer.
the
man
is
--
person
is
hurt,
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
file
notice
of
injury
under
pennsylvania,
under
the
federal
law
and
starts
to
make
payments.
it's
the
employer
indeed
at
the
outset
--
at
the
outset
who
makes
that
election.
a
fraction
--
i
think
the
national
safety
council
and
u.s.
department
of
labors
--
bureau
of
labor
standards
reports
there
are
some
two
million
timeless
accident
cases
reported
each
year
in
the
united
states
and
a
fraction
of
them
result
in
contested
workmen's
compensation
claims.
most
of
the
claims
are
paid
as
a
matter
of
course
because
the
employer
recognizes
if
there's
an
injury
and
are
paid,
very
few
are
in
dispute.
the
significance
of
this
of
course
is
that
the
injured
worker
makes
--
makes
--
unless
he
consults
a
lawyer,
unless
something
happens
to
him
claim,
unless
he
doesn't
get
compensation,
unless
compensation
payments
stop,
does
not
consult
a
lawyer
and
therefore
he
himself
exercises
no
choice.
this
case
is
a
matter
of
fact
where
sun
ship
comes
in
and
tells
what
a
beneficent
employer
they
are.
when
these
five
men
were
injured,
sun
ship
never
reported
this
is
a
--
as
a
work-related
injury.
they
say
that
under
federal
law,
these
men
are
covered,
but
sun
ship
never
reported
any
of
these
five
cases
to
the
deputy
commissioner's
office,
so
the
deputy
commissioner
could
advise
people
of
their
rights
and
start
the
federal
law
working.
the
men
in
this
case
when
consulted
an
attorney
in
our
office,
and
we
filed
claims
under
the
state
law.
we
filed
claims
under
the
state
law
because
(1)
state
law
in
pennsylvania
on
a
disfigurement
case
takes
about
68
weeks
for
an
adjudication.
state
--
under
federal,
it's
between
18
months
and
two
years
because
we
go
through
the
informal
proceedings
before
the
deputy
commissioner
determines
if
the
case
is
settled,
and
if
it's
not
settled,
it
then
goes
to
administrative
law
judge
and
we
wait
for
a
--
with
a
full
hearing
and
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
lots
of
testimony
are
taken
and
the
average
has
been
somewhere
between
18
months
and
two
years
for
hearing.
and
of
course,
in
these
cases,
the
awards
where
somewhere
between
500
and
$1500
per
man
but
conceptually,
because
pennsylvania
has
a
higher
limit
in
disfigurement
cases,
a
--
a
small
type
of
disfigurement
is
going
to
warrant
more
money
than
under
federal
law,
we
have
$3,500
as
a
maximum.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
is
bound
by
davis,
is
bound
by
calbeck.
in
davis,
the
exact
issue
was
presented.
davis
was
a
person
who
was
conceivably
working
on
a
barge
in
a
navigable
water
in
the
state
of
--
of
washington.
he
was
--
as
a
result
of
industrial
injury,
he
--
he
fell
into
the
--
the
river,
the
navigable
water
and
died.
he
was
paid
benefits
under
the
--
when
he
applied
for
benefits
under
the
--
the
state
of
washington
law,
the
--
the
defense
of
the
federal
act
was
raised
and
there,
the
court
in
davis
recognizing
the
strong
policy
arguments
and
the
strong
policy
argument
of
course
said,
“no,
there
is
concurrent
and
overlapping
jurisdiction”
and
the
strong
policy
arguments
there
which
are
the
strong
policy
arguments
in
calbeck
and
a
strong
policy
arguments
here
as
if
the
act
is
to
be
construed
liberally
to
protect
injured
workers.
and
unless
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
you're
going
to
have
the
injured
worker
being
adversely
affected
by
uncertainty
as
to
where
he
should
go.
you're
going
to
have
an
adversely
being
affected
by
long
delay
in
getting
his
benefits
and
you're
going
to
have
him
adversely
be
affected
by
the
expense
in
long
court
proceedings
to
determine
what
law
applies.
and
i
say
this
because
of
the
fact
that
if
we
make
either
state
law
exclusive
or
federal
law
exclusive.
what
that
means
is
that
when
a
case
suggests
exclusivity
of
either
state
law
or
federal
law,
the
employer
is
going
to
raise
that
as
a
defense.
and
this
is
extremely
crucial
especially
in
view
of
the
1972
amendments
which
expanded
coverage
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers
act.
so
we're
going
to
have
tangential
situations
where
state
law
--
state
courts
of
the
maritime
states,
and
i
guess
mississippi
valley
states
and
the
states
which
affect
navigable
waters
are
going
to
be
decided
--
be
deciding
federal
coverage
of
the
longshoremen's
harbor
workers'
act
because
if
the
--
the
question
on
the
exclusive
--
if
this
court
holds
that
the
federal
law
is
exclusive,
then
a
state
claim
would
be
barred.
the
way
it
stands
under
concurrent
jurisdiction,
the
states
rule
on
their
law,
the
federal
government
rules
on
--
on
its
law
if
a
claimant
decides
to
go
both
ways
which
is
of
course
a
remote
situation.
but
assuming
a
claimant
decides,
takes
a
federal
benefit
and
feel
it's
state's
benefit
is
more
--
is
better
for
him
or
vice
versa,
takes
a
state
benefit
and
then
comes
in
to
the
--
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
lurie
state.
from
--
from
the
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
no,
they
did
come
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
joseph
lurie
he
sure
did.
oh,
which
--
which
one?
the
five
claimants
came
to
me,
judge.
mr.
joseph
lurie
no,
sir.
what
happened
--
let
me
explain.
when
these
men
were
injured,
sun
ship
figured
that
because
they
had
a
facial
scar
and
were
unaware
of
the
law
that
they
would
never
file
claim
and
then
it
would
fade
and
it
would
go
away.
therefore,
sun
ship
which
was
the
administrator
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
as
far
as
the
claimants
are
concerned,
were
silent.
they
did
not
file
the
notice
of
compensation
payable
or
--
or
the
notice
of
injury
with
--
with
the
deputy
commissioner's
office.
now,
just
to
backtrack
a
little
of
what
happens
when
an
employer
is
duty-bound
under
the
act
to
file
a
notice
of
injury
with
the
deputy
commissioner's
office
whose
charged
with
congress
to
administer
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act.
when
they
filed
that
notice
in
the
deputy
commissioner's
office
sends
a
letter
to
the
injured
person
telling
them
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
and
contact
us,
establish
a
relationship
with
our
office
and
we'll
tell
you
how
to
get
your
rights.
now,
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
sun
ship
did
not
file
this
notice.
later,
when
these
men
had
these
scars,
they
contacted
our
office
and
said,
“can
i
get
paid
for
this
facial
disfigurement?”
as
a
lawyer,
i
felt
they
could
get
paid
under
the
federal
act
or
the
state
act
and
since
there
was
concurrent
or
overlapping
jurisdiction
and
we
proceeded
under
the
state
law
because
it
was
easier
to
get
the
benefits.
mr.
joseph
lurie
absolutely
nothing
because
no
proceeding
has
ever
been
instituted
by
the
shipyard
in
the
federal
court
to
pay
them
--
in
the
federal
administration
to
pay
them
benefits.
mr.
joseph
lurie
they
got
absolutely
not
one
cent
as
a
result
of
their
industrial
injury
from
this
employer.
mr.
joseph
lurie
even
as
of
today,
[attempt
to
laughter]
haven't,
no.
so
that's
why
were
here
because
what
--
what
sun
ship
is
saying
and
this
is
the
--
this
isn't
money
quite
frankly.
i
think
the
justice
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
--
is
its
--
its
--
in
a
short
range,
it's
money.
mr.
joseph
lurie
but
in
the
long
range,
it's
--
it's
rather
the
principle
that
there's
going
to
be
substantial
delays
and
uncertainty
if
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.
the
workmen's
compensation
act
does
not
apply
--
for
example,
they
raise
the
--
the
--
the
mccartin
doctrine
of
full
and
complete
concurrent
jurisdiction.
now,
that's
not
involved
in
my
case
because
in
this
case
here,
these
men
have
not
accepted
any
benefits
under
--
under
federal
law.
but
most
certainly,
workmen's
compensation
law
is
not
a
final
judgment.
for
example,
if
--
if
an
order
is
made
by
a
--
administrative
law
judge
in
a
federal
workmen's
compensation
case,
that
--
that
judgment
could
be
modified
under
section
22
or
that
order
could
be
modified
up
to
a
year
later.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
don't
think
it
really
were
--
should
work
like
that
because
for
example,
conversely,
that
the
--
the
modification
order
under
--
under
pennsylvania
could
come
10
years
after
the
decision.
that
is
the
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
right.
that
--
that
is,
the
compensation
benefits
might
be
suspended
and
no
benefits
are
paid
but
the
man
has
10
years
in
which
to
reopen
the
claim
so
--
so
he
could
come
in
with
new
facts
etcetera
to
review
anywhere
from
three
to
10
years
after
the
--
the
judgment
is
final.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
don't
think
the
--
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
way
--
that
may
very
well
be
but
that's
the
way
the
workmen's
compensation
law
works.
it
--
we're
not
talking
about
final
judgments,
we're
talking
about
the
day-to-day
workings
of
a
work
--
state
work
--
state
and
federal
workmen's
compensation
law.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
think
in
calbeck
the
--
the
court
sort
of
just
ignored
it.
for
example,
in
--
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
last
page
of
calbeck
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
page
131,
where
they're
talking
about
binding
elections.
they
cite
with
approval
at
the
bottom
of
page
131
and
132
where
the
court
cites
with
approval,
three
federal
circuit
court
cases
which
held
that
full
faith
and
credit
does
not
apply
to
orders
of
the
workmen's
compensation
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i'm
suggesting
by
inference,
sir,
that
in
calbeck,
this
court
has
--
has
sort
of
ignored
magnolia
and
said,
“we
don't
think”
--
for
example,
one
of
the
people
in
calbeck
did
receive
state
benefits
under
an
order.
so
consequently,
what
this
court
has
done
is
say
with
approval,
the
--
the
four
--
three
circuit
court
cases
which
appear
there
where
the
circuit
courts
ruled
that
obtaining
that
final
--
obtaining
a
state
order
does
not
bar
federal
coverage.
i
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
i
--
i
think
as
a
practical
matter.
i
agree
but
cannot
--
i
agree
that
you
should.
i
think
that
a
claimant,
if
--
if
there's
a
more
liberal
act
that
this
man
has
given
up
his
--
his
health
and
his
life
for
his
employer
and
he
should
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
most
liberal
act.
mr.
joseph
lurie
and
as
long
as
there
are
set
offs,
i
think
he
should
go
whichever
way
he
goes
and
that
he
shouldn't
be
hooked
with
the
uncertainties
there
of
going
to
a
lawyer
who
did
advise
him
of
the
--
what
were
the
correct
benefits
or
choosing
himself
to
proceed
on
benefits
without
having
competent
counsel.
so
i
--
i
think,
yes.
mr.
joseph
lurie
right.
mr.
joseph
lurie
no.
he
couldn't
get
it
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
because
under
federal
--
federal
law
that
--
the
cases
have
held
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
paid
for
issues
of
law,
would
simply
file
--
involve
attorney's
fees.
the
benefits
review
board
has
held
that
if
the
only
issue
is
an
attorney
fee,
we're
not
going
to
pay
attorney's
fees
if
that's
the
only
issue.
i
think
for
example,
i
see
nothing
wrong
if
this
man
made
$1000
a
week
for
example
and
was
stuck
with
--
in
pennsylvania,
say,
or
some
other
state
pays
less
than
the
$300
and
some
odd
dollars
which
is
the
state
maximum,
for
example,
pennsylvania
pays
242
and
then
realized
that
if
he
went
to
federal,
he
could
get
--
what,
$376
i
think
is
the
maximum
or
somewhere
thereabout.
and
then
--
and
then
was
indeed
covered
by
under
calbeck
and
davis,
then
i
think
that
most
certainly,
he
should
be
entitled
to
--
to
go
collect
that
under
federal
and
also
perhaps
collect
counsel
fees
in
that
case,
yes.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
only
--
he
only
gets
one
--
paid
from
one
person
anyway
i.e.
his
employer.
that
is,
that
the
federal
government
does
not
pay
benefits,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
doesn't
pay
benefits.
so
he
gets
the
benefits
from
his
employer
and
he's
not
getting
paid
twice.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
not
usually
because
--
because
what
i'm
saying
is,
is
that
if
this
court
is
--
comes
down
to
weigh
in
this
decision
the
way
we
hope
it
will,
the
employer
will
certainly
get
the
message
that
since
there
is
full
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
since
he's
been
paid
under
state,
they
put
him
involuntarily
under
state
and
if
there
is
full
concurrent
jurisdiction
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
--
then
the
employers
don't
want
to
litigate
twice.
he's
going
to
say,
well,
since
there
were
--
or
in
–
or
an
honest
and
a
intelligent
employer
is
going
to
say,
“since
there
is
full
concurrent
jurisdiction,
my
injured
worker
should
get
the
maximum
benefit
under
which
--
whichever
jurisdiction
applies.”
because
otherwise,
you're
going
to
have
the
employer
saying,
“well,
put
this
guy
into
pennsylvania
because
the
state
--
the
--
the
maximum
is
less
than
the
federal.”
and
as
i
--
as
i
think
the
--
every
one
would
agree
that
the
--
that
the
workmen's
compensation
acts
are
indeed
administered
by
the
employer.
there
can't
be
any
other
way
when
you
have
two
million
people
sustaining
time
laws
injuries
in
united
states
everyday
--
every
--
every
year.
i
just
like
to
address
myself
to
--
to
a
couple
of
points.
they
argue
--
sun
ship
argues
change
of
the
197
--
by
the
1972
law.
and
the
only
change
that
we
could
find
of
any
significance
is
the
deletion
in
--
in
section
3
(a)
of
--
of
that
provision
that
says,
“if
recovery
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.”
and
the
five
states
which
have
--
which
have
considered
this
issue
plus
the
four
circuit,
have
agreed
with
the
interpretation
that
this
court
in
calbeck
in
eliminating
that
language.
and
by
eliminating
that
language
--
perhaps
it
wasn't
as
clear
what
the
court
meant.
the
dissenting
opinion
said
that
calbeck
eliminated
this
--
this
problem
of
concurrence
--
this
problem
to
excluclusifi
--
exclusiveness
--
well,
the
exclusiveness
of
the
law
because
what
it
did,
it
says,
if
there's
an
area
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
solid
wall
here
and
if
a
state
law
applies,
then
you
can't
have
a
federal
right.
and
what
calbeck
did
is
--
just
had
the
overlap
concept
out
of
davis
and
said,
“well,
if
there
is
a
federal
law,
if
there
is
a
state
law,
then
we
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.”
now,
the
congress,
it
did
--
did
what
calbeck
did.
it
eliminated
this
and
i
don't
see
how
the
--
the
appellee
could
argue
--
the
appellant
could
argue
that
by
eliminating
this,
it
made
jurisdiction
exclusive
because
the
only
area
in
the
law
where
we
could
or
would
deal
with
--
with
this
question
of
jurisdiction
is
under
the
situs
provision
of
section
3
(a).
and
in
that,
what
they
did
was,
they
--
congress
agreed
with
calbeck.
now,
mr.
hayes
says
well,
the
court
didn't
say
what
they
really
said
in
calbeck.
well,
sometimes
it's
hard
to
--
to
read
opinions
of
--
of
the
supreme
court
but
most
certainly
the
dissent
said
that
it
--
that
it
did
it,
it
took
it
out.
larson
said
it
took
out.
gilmore
and
black
said
it
took
it
out.
so,
to
the
extent
that
--
that
the
congressmen
may
not
have
read
the
actual
decision,
they've
read
what
others
said
about
it
and
what
others
said
about
it
was
that
we
have
full
concurrent
jurisdiction
because
we've
eliminated
the
state
--
the
state
and
federal
barriers
and
that's
what
i
think
had
happened.
the
--
they
argue
that
section
5
pre
--
is
exclusive
and
therefore,
precludes
a
workman's
compensation
remedy
other
than
the
federal
remedy,
or
all
states
have
this
section
5.
and
section
5
was
the
price
that
the
injured
worker
paid
for
workmen's
compensation,
thus,
he
gave
up
his
common
law
action
against
his
employer
to
receive
benefits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
five
men
could
have
brought
common
law
actions
against
sun
ship
if
they
wanted
to
because
if
we
read
the
exclusivity
part
of
--
of
section
5
(a),
it
says
--
it's
exclusive,
they
tell
us
but
they
say
except
if
an
employer
fails
to
secure
payment
of
compensation
as
required
by
this
chapter,
which
sun
ship
did
in
this
case.
an
injured
employee
or
his
legal
representative
in
case
the
--
death
results
from
the
injury
may
elect
a
claim
compensation
under
this
chapter
or
what
are
we
--
what
are
they
giving
us,
what
are
they
giving
the
injured
worker,
they
took
away
or
to
maintain
an
action
at
law
or
an
admiralty
for
damages
on
account
of
such
injury
or
death.
so
that's
what
they
--
they
--
congress
has
taken
away
by
the
exclusivity.
that
is
that
right
to
maintain
that
action
in
law
or
the
action
on
admiralty.
they
made
no
--
they
made
no
thought
or
mention
of
--
of
state
workmen's
compensation
law,
and
that's
why
in
davis,
the
court
said,
“it
doesn't
apply,
5
(a)
doesn't
apply.”
and
indeed,
it
does
not
apply.
the
issue
is
framed
by
the
appellant
in
its
brief
as
it
appears
on
page
6,
is
a
very
simple
issue
which
this
court
amply
answered
in
the
askew
case.
askew
was
a
unanimous
opinion
by
the
court
and
starting
on
page
37
and
continuing,
is
that
extremely
eloquent
and
intelligent
discussion
deciding
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
defendant
--
the
sun
ship
says,
“the
issue
is
whether
the
plain
--
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act
is
repugnant
to
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
admiralty
clause
in
is
it
--
when
it's
applied
to
permit
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
pennsylvania
over
an
area
within
coverage
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act”
and
this
was
the
exact
issue
in
askew.
in
askew,
the
issue
was
whether
a
state
constitutionally
may
exercise
its
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
337
--
may
exercise
its
police
power
respecting
maritime
activities
concurrently
with
the
federal
government.
and
--
and
here's
a
resounding
answer,
yes
it
may
and
--
and
i
--
i
pray
that
--
that
you
will
answer
the
question
in
the
same
way.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
lurie
the
--
the
same
exact
issues
were
involved.
what
it
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
that's
--
you
have
the
--
goes
to
different
act
entirely.
mr.
joseph
lurie
exactly.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
they're
not
saying
that
here.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
what
they
do
is
(voice
overlap)
they
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
we're
--
we're
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
no,
i
think
they
did.
they
--
they
said
for
example
that
you
have
--
here
is
your
--
here
is
your
--
your
right,
your
remedy.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
--
there
was
not
--
workmen's
compensation
was
--
was
unheard
of
and
they
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
this
is
when
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
yes.
federal
--
determined
in
19th
century.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
that
--
that
may
very
well
be
but
what
the
court
did
there
is
saying
you're
going
to
--
that
the
legislature
said,
“you're
going
to
apply
federal
law.
we
don't
care
if
you
go
to
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
courts,
but
i
think
the
--
the
law
seem
to
indicate
and
court's
interpretation
is,
is
that
we're
talking
only
about
federal
law.
mr.
joseph
lurie
right.
well,
i
don't
think
this
court
have
said
that
and
where
is
their
congressional
intent
that
the
--
that
the
same
applies
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
lurie
no.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
history
of
the
--
of
section
3
(a)
under
the
1972
act
which
i've
just
mentioned
is
--
is
--
you
could
--
you
could
get
no
other
interpretation
that
congress
in
1972
realized
what
davis
said,
what
calbeck
said
and
therefore,
eliminated
from
the
act
language
that
would
give
state
courts
exclusive
remedy
where
you
have
a
--
an
injury
which
occurred
within
the
twilight
zone.
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
i
don't
it
was
a
--
i
don't
think
--
i
-
-i
know
that
the
word
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
--
it
--
it
was
supposed
to
cover
injuries
which
occurred
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
right,
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
joseph
lurie
no,
the
--
the
intent
was
the
quid
pro
quo
was
to
give
up
the
common
law
action
that
zurichi
in
return
for
which,
the
jurisdictional
limits
of
the
act
were
to
be
opened.
there
was
--
mr.
joseph
lurie
they
--
who,
the
congress?
mr.
joseph
lurie
well,
let
me
--
i
would
suggest
that
in
1962,
this
court
came
down
with
--
with
calbeck
and
congress
took
no
action
from
1962
to
1972
to
say,
“wait
a
minute,
supreme
court,
you
were
wrong
in
calbeck.”
and
certainly,
since
1972,
state
courts
--
supreme
courts
have
been
coming
down
since
1976
interpreting
calbeck
and
1972
amendments
to
mean
what
the
appellees
say
they
mean
in
this
case
and
congress
has
again
remained
silent.
thank
you.
