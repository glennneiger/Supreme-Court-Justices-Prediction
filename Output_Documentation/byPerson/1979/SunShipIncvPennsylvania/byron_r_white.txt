have
the
maritime
--
do
all
the
maritime
states
purport
to
extend
coverage
that
is
clearly
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice

pennsylvania
does.
justice

white
pennsylvania
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
general
rule?
isn't
it
the
general
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
is
that
the
general
situation
not
to
rule?
justice
byron

white
so
if
they
were
a
claim
from
permanent
disability
under
the
federal
act
and
it
was
denied
--
if
there
was
concurrency,
you
could
try
it
over
again
in
the
state
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
might've
filed
at
both
places
at
the
same
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
he
loses
in
a
--
in
a
higher
level
of
jurisdiction,
he
tries
it
out
in
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
i
understand
that

justice
byron

white
that
that
would
follow
from
concurrency.

(inaudible)
frustration,
the
federal
objective,
an
--
an
actual
conflict
or
a
frustration
of
some
federal
objective.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
not
either
--
either,
there
hasn't
have
to
be
a
--
some
affirmative
statement
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
the
--
just
--
just
the
general
existence
of
a
federal
law
doesn't
preempt
the
state
law
in
the
same
area,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there's
a
conflict
or
a
frustration
of
the
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
remedy
--
what
--
what
congressional
authority
did
congress
purport
to
be
exercising
in
the
1972
amendments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
in
the
commerce
power,
you
don't
have
any
automatic
preemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
found
an
intent
to
--
to
preempt
the
field.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
that
isn't
--
that
just
doesn't
automatically
follow
from
the
passage
of
a
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
where
do
you
find
that
kind
of
intent
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
gilmore
--
gilmore
and
black
used
the
elimination
of
that
language
or
just
the
opposite
to
prove
just
exactly
the
opposite.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
considerable
--
that's
a
considerable
retreat
from
saying
that
it
proves
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
you
could
proceed
under
both
acts
for
the
same
injury
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
could
you
--
could
you
get
your
award
under
the
state
--
under
the
--
under
--
say,
could
you
get
your
award
here
in
pennsylvania
and
get
attorney's
fees
under
the
federal
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
pennsyl
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
--
suppose
he
applies
under
the
pennsylvania
law
and
he's
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
finds
out
when
he's
getting
paid
that
his
attorney's
fees
come
out
of
it.
now,
can
he
go
--
can
he
file
another
federal
act
and
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
might
--
how
do
i
put
it.
well,
why
not
--
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
very
first
compensation
for
injury
wasn't
involved
there,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
--
how
would
you
argue
--
why
is
this
different
from
the
employer's
liability
cases
on
--
on
--
covering
the
railroads,
workmen's
compensation
laws
don't
apply
to
railroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
it's
a
different
act
but
what's
in
it
that's
different
than
this?
it's
just
to
comprehend
all
this
--
the
court
said
was,
that
was
a
comprehensive
scheme
to
cover
railroad
injuries.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
the
--
the
question.
that's
the
question
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
that
what
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
congress
intended
to
do?
they
didn't
--
certainly
didn't
--
so
much
different
here
than
they
did
in
the
employers
liability
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time
--
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
employer's
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they're
going
to
get
up
here
to
get
settled
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
winfield
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
right.
they
said
the
--
the
congressional
statute
providing
comprehensive
scheme
for
--
for
compensating
work-related
injuries
was
covered
by
the
federal
law,
now,
that
--
that
was
just
--
that's
the
exclusive
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that's
--
i
know
that's
your
position
but
that's
the
question
in
the
--
here
whether
--
you
still
haven't
indicated
to
me
why
any
evidence
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
to
--
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
winfield
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
longshoremen's
act
originally
was
just
a
gap-filler
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
supposed
to
cover
injuries
that
state
compensation
systems
been
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly,
there
was
more
of
an
intent
than
that
in
this
case.
i
mean
in
this
--
under
this
statute,
this
statute
wasn't
motivated
solely
of
any
such
intent.
it
couldn't
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
for
the
first
time,
in
1972,
they
departed
for
the
first
time
from
--
form
the
notion
that
the
longshoremen's
act
applies
only
when
a
state
act
may
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
