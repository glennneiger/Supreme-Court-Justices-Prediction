mr.
hayes,
the
pennsylvania
statute,
i
suppose,
purports
to
extend
three
miles
out
from
shore,
doesn't
it?
it
says
any
place
within
the
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
the
--
the
reasoning
in
--
is
it
davis
that
--
that
if
jurisdiction
--
federal
jurisdiction
were
clear,
remedy
would
be
exclusive,
did
that
rely
on
the
notion
that
--
as
in
jensen
that
where
you
got
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it's
got
to
be
federal
remedy
or
did
it
rely
on
the
notion
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
exclusive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
that
this
is
going
to
be
idea
of
it
that
after
the
calbeck
decision,
you
certainly
have
section
5
still
reading
or
then
reading
as
it
still
reads
and
it
was
then
assumed,
there
was
an
area
of
overlap.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
