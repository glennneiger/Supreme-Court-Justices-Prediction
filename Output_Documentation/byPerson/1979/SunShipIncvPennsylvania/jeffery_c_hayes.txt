mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
commonwealth
court
of
pennsylvania
which
affirmed
awards
to
claimant
appellees
for
facial
disfigurement
under
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
today
is
whether
pennsylvania
may
constitutionally
award
benefits
under
its
state
workmen's
compensation
law
for
injuries
to
maritime
workers
covered
by
the
longshoremen's
act
as
amended
in
1972.
the
central
facts
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
the
question
are
not
in
dispute
in
this
court.
sun
ship
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
it
is
engaged
in
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
activities
at
its
facilities
adjoining
the
delaware
river,
a
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
each
of
the
claimants,
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
was
employed
by
sun
ship,
and
was
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
either
shipbuilding
or
ship
repair,
and
as
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
in
addition,
each
of
the
appellees
were
injured
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
as
that
term
has
been
defined
in
both
sections
3
(a)
of
the
amended
longshoremen's
act,
its
covering
provisions,
and
in
section
24
which
defines
employer.
it
is
further
undisputed
that
the
injuries
involved
here
fall
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
every
administrative
tribunal
below
and
the
court
below
so
found
and
it
has
never
been
in
question
here
and
indeed
it's
conceded
by
appellees
in
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
must
be
reversed
because
upon
analysis
of
the
amended
longshoremen's
act,
the
legislative
history
to
the
1972
amendments
and
consideration
of
the
state's
purposes
and
objectives,
it
is
evident
that
the
congress
intended
to
preempt
the
application
of
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
when
enacted
the
1972
amendments
to
the
longshoremen's
act
as
those
laws
might
apply
to
maritime
workers
injured
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
in
addition
to
the
extent
that
a
review
of
the
longshoremen's
act
and
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act
reveals
both
a
general
and
in
the
very
instance
of
this
case,
specific
conflicts
with
the
regulatory
scheme
determined
to
apply
by
congress,
the
pennsylvania
act
must
yield.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes,
sir.
on
question
--
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
questions
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
longshoremen's
act
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
--
at
the
edges
of
federal
coverage.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well
your
honor
it
--
it's
certainly
possible.
the
concept
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
edge
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
and
there
maybe
cases
which
fall
close
to
that
line
which
may
give
occasion
to
courts
to
consider
on
which
side
of
the
line
and
a
--
a
davis
kind
of
resolution
of
those
conflicts
might
result.
but
of
course,
in
the
course
of
amending
the
longshoremen's
act,
congress
substantially
removed
those
problems
at
least
in
the
context
of
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
operations
because
it
moved
the
line
away
from
the
water's
edge
which
had
been
the
most
troublesome
line
of
all.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes,
sir.
there
is
still
a
line.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
it
will
not
always
be
a
clear
line.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
addressed
to
the
states,
many
of
which
have
equitable
tolling
principles
that
operate
in
other
contexts
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
some
may
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
and
i
think
that
the
statutes
may
well
be
tolled
or
ought
to
be
tolled
under
any
number
of
principles
because
plainly,
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
a
statute
of
limitations
would
not
be
met
because
the
employer
of
course
would
be
on
notice
of
the
claim
and
would
realize
that
it's
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
and
indeed,
there's
no
reason
to
think
the
states
would
adopt
any
other
rule
than
what
the
benefits
review
board
has
adopted
for
the
federal
courts
and
what
the
--
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
as
an
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
principles
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
your
honor,
in
fact
i
would
--
i
think
it's
clear
from
some
of
the
decisions
that
are
cited
in
the
various
briefs
that
florida
for
example
is
a
state
that
plainly
does
not
purport
to
extend
its
remedy
to
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
--
least
claims
within
the
longshoremen's
act.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
pennsylvania
statute
is
a
statute
of
general
application
applying
to
all
employers
injured
within
the
common
law.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
i
think
florida
as
i
--
as
i've
already
indicated,
expressly
limits
the
longshoremen's
act
--
i'm
sorry,
limits
its
statute
and
it
doesn't
apply
where
the
longshoremen's
act
does
apply
and
there
are
other
such
statutes
in
other
maritime
states
which
--
which
work
in
a
similar
way.
pennsylvania's
does
not.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
does
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
and
--
and
it
plainly
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
as
a
--
no,
i
don't
believe
it
has,
your
honor.
i
mean
expressly
it
has
not
been
overruled
and
i
think
that
in
addition,
you
have
operating
not
only
the
pure
admiralty
principle
which
johnson
--
jensen
represents
uniformity,
but
you
have
a
kind
of
supremacy
notion,
if
you
will,
that
operates
in
tandem
with
the
admiralty
clause
where
the
those
cases
recognizing
uniformity
principle
have
always
found
that
where
congress
moves
into
the
admiralty
area,
uniformity
is
the
rule
and
in
addition,
the
supremacy
clause
analysis
itself
compels
the
result
that
if
congress
has
occupied
the
field
that
the
states
are
not
free
to
interfere.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes
sir.
there
is
and
i
think
that
that
is
why
the
--
the
problem
of
the
line
that
--
that
you
raise
with
me
initially
is
important
here
because
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
necessarily
creates
two
lines.
it
creates
the
constitutional
line,
the
jensen
line,
if
you
will,
over
which
the
state
remedy
cannot
extend
and
secondly,
you
have
the
edge
of
federal
coverage
somewhere
to
the
landward
side
of
the
sea
line.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
and
i
think
that
there
you
have
two
kinds
of
jurisdictional
disputes
that
you
might
have
to
answer,
perhaps
not
in
any
individual
case,
but
certainly
over
the
course
of
the
whole
series
of
cases
that
are
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
and
it
purports
indeed
to
extend
to
injuries
that
might
arise
out
of
contracts
of
hire
entered
into
in
--
in
pennsylvania.
it
is
the
mccartin
type
statute,
if
you
will.
the
--
it
is
the
post
1972
longshoremen's
act
which
is
the
central
focus
of
the
analysis
of
course.
and
there
is
really
little
reason
to
be
overly
concerned
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
which
struggle
with
the
very
difficult
questions
presented
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
1927
act
and
the
meaning
of
the
phrases
which
were
read
variously
to
extend
or
limit
federal
or
state
jurisdiction.
first
of
all,
it's
clear
from
the
totality
of
circumstances
shown
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
the
congress
has
totally
occupied
the
field
of
compensation
to
maritime
workers
and
expressly
so
to
the
exclusion
of
state
law.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
question.
this
is
not
a
twilight
zone
or
a
borderline
case.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
your
honor,
in
this
specific
case,
the
statement
is
correct
that
the
state
remedy
would
have
made
it
possible
for
these
claimants
to
receive
more
money
than
they
could
under
the
pennsylvania
act.
however,
that
statement
does
not
extend
to
other
provisions
of
the
act.
the
pennsylvania
act
in
other
respects
and
perhaps
in
the
respect
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about
in
1972,
namely,
the
problem
presented
by
permanently
disabled
maritime
workers,
the
pennsylvania
remedy
is
less.
that
point
is
established
when
one
realizes
that
the
federal
maximum
level
set
by
the
director
of
the
office
of
workmen's
compensation
programs
is
$426,
whereas,
under
pennsylvania,
it's
$244.
so
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
your
honor?
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
it
introduces
a
level
of
uncertainty
into
the
administration
of
a
longshoreman
--
i'm
sorry,
a
shipbuilding
type
of
operation
which
is
what
sun
ship
has.
the
certainty
of
application
of
the
federal
act
is
going
to
operate
in
such
a
way
here
as
to
benefit
not
only
sun
ship
but
to
benefit
claimants,
because
it
is
going
to
put
both
of
--
both
claimants
and
sun
ship
in
the
position
of
having
an
interest
in
resolving
the
disputes
under
the
informal
mechanisms
provided
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
but
you're
not
necessarily
available
under
the
pennsylvania
act.
whereas,
if
we
are
--
if
sun
ship
in
particular
is
going
to
be
in
a
situation
of
always
having
to
concern
itself
with
the
availability
of
a
second
remedy,
we're
going
to
be
much
less
inclined
to
resolve
those
disputes
until
a
jurisdictional
issue
is
resolved
specifically
and
clearly.
because
it
is
clear
i
believe
under
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
that
if
the
federal
act
applies,
section
5,
by
its
terms,
makes
that
remedy
exclusive.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
he
might,
yes,
your
honor
i
--
i
suppose
that's
true,
although,
he
might
be
able
to
try
it
again
in
the
state
system
if
the
state
had
a
tolling
kind
of
principle
of
its
statute
of
limitations,
recognizing
if
the
federal
decision
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
he
might
file
in
both
places.
that
would
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
he
may,
your
honor,
although
i
think
that
that
introduces
a
whole
set
of
difficult
problems
also.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
if
--
if
you
assume
that
--
that
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
that
would
follow
from
concurrency
and
it
would
follow
--
the
problems
would
be
introduced
in
any
situation
where
the
decision
by
the
federal
tribunal
that
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
if
the
denial
of
the
claim
was
based
on
anything
other
than
a
lack
of
jurisdiction,
you
have
difficult
problems
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
introduced
into
the
state
system
at
that
point
just
as
you
do
in
the
federal
system
which
the
cases
already
point
to.
in
1972,
the
longshoremen's
act
was
no
longer
a
gap
filler.
it
became
an
affirmative
exercise
of
jurisdiction
both
in
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
which
was
tied
to
the
situs
and
to
admiralty
contract
jurisdiction
because
congress
expressly
brought
within
its
coverage
new
categories
of
employees,
and
with
it,
their
employment
relationship
with
an
employer
covered
by
the
act
whose
business
affects
traditional
maritime
matters.
and
this
exercise
comes
in
an
area
imbued
with
a
dominant
federal
interest
and
where
uniformity
of
the
maritime
law
is
the
normal
rule.
that
has
never
been
seriously
disputed
in
this
case.
congress'
intent
to
preempt
state
law
in
the
area
of
compensation
to
maritime
workers
is
clearly
stated
in
the
act.
we've
already
had
reference
to
section
5
which
when
combined
with
section
4,
which
makes
the
employers'
obligation
to
pay
compensation
and
secure
payment
of
compensation
mandatory,
plainly
indicates
that
the
federal
scheme
operates
exclusively.
that
is
to
say
in
place
of
any
other.
in
contrast,
the
act
contains
no
language
which
indicates
an
intention
to
permit
state
law
to
operate
and
thus,
the
situation
posed
here
is
directly
opposite
to
that
presented
to
the
court
in
askew
here.
indeed
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
that
has
been
the
test
and
i
think
the
court
specifically,
in
city
of
burbank
versus
lockheed,
made
it
clear
that
there
is
not
a
requirement
that
there'd
be
an
expressed
statement
of
congressional
intent
to
preempt.
and
in
any
event,
(voice
overlap)
we
would
rely
on
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
yes
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
that
does
not
have
to
mean
affirmative
statement
that
the
states
are
asked
for,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
but
section
5
will
provide
that.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
honor,
that's
what
i
meant
to
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
in
the
admiralty
area,
there
may
well
be
an
absolute
preemption
of
the
states
where
congress
comes
in
as
it
has
done
here
with
a
comprehensive
and
complete
remedy.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
its
--
its
authority
--
its
--
i
think
the
legislative
history,
mr.
justice
white,
is
unclear.
i
think
it
could
be
read
either
as
the
commerce
power
or
as
its
admiralty
power
both
comprised
of
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
no,
but
you
may
--
but
under
the
commerce
power
as
you
do
in
the
case
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
if
as
in
--
pursuant
to
an
exercise
of
the
commerce
power,
congress
moves
into
an
area
and
defines
a
complete
remedy
and
provides
a
--
an
--
a
solution
to
a
problem
which
is
complete
and
total
in
and
of
itself
as
--
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
there
is
no
expressed
preemption
there
and
there
is
no
statement
that
that
act
is
exclusive
nonetheless
this
court
held
that
state
efforts
to
provide
a
remedy
for
injured
railway
workers
was
preempted
by
the
fact
that
congress
had
acted
affirmatively
under
the
fela.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
that
attempt
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
no,
sir.
it
does
not
automatically
follow.
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
i
think,
your
honor,
we
find
that
the
act
has
--
has
changed
substantially
in
1972
where
you
have
congress
exercising
its
full
admiralty
powers
in
both
maritime
and
in
contract.
you
find
that
evidence
because
what
congress
has
done
is
it
has
not
limited
the
remedy
as
it
have
been
limited
prior
to
1972
to
injures
--
injuries
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
that
is
a
situs-oriented
task.
in
addition,
congress
in
section
5
said
both
before
and
after
1972
that
the
remedy
is
exclusive.
and
significantly,
in
1972,
congress
eliminated
the
only
language
that
had
ever
existed
in
the
longshoremen's
act
that
seem
to
permit
the
states
to
operate
by
ruling
the
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes
sir.
i
understand
that
they
do
and
i
--
i
understand
that
the
--
the
proviso
however,
i
think
and
the
--
the
--
i
believe
the
united
states
reads
it
differently
in
this
case
as
well.
the
proposition
though
i
think
is
equally
consistent.
the
elimination
of
the
proviso
is
equally
consistent
with
the
notion
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
law
because
if
the
proviso
remains
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
yes,
sir.
i'm
simply
responding
to
--
to
the
--
to
the
point
that
you
ascribe
to
professors
gilmore
and
black
and
would
simply
say
that
i
think
that
it
is
more
likely
and
it
is
a
better
reading
of
the
elimination
of
the
proviso
to
say
that
what
that
indicates
is,
that
congress
is
now
coming
on
land
with
the
longshoremen's
remedy
in
1972.
and
if
it
leaves
the
proviso
only
in
place,
it
is
coming
on
land
with
the
remedy
where
the
states,
under
this
court's
decision
in
nacirema
and
--
and
many
decisions
before
had
been
viewed
as
competent
to
operate.
so
if
it
comes
on
land
with
the
proviso,
i
think
it's
plainly
creating
a
concurrent
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
come
on
land
with
the
proviso.
it
eliminates
the
proviso
and
at
the
same
time,
it
expands
the
coverage
of
the
act
in
such
a
way
to
indicate
that
it
is
exercising
both
its
admiralty
power
and
tort
and
in
contract,
and
it's
doing
it
in
an
area
where
uniformity
is
the
law
and
i
think
that
the
congressional
intent
to
preempt
the
field
is
demonstrated
by
the
statutory
language
alone.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
were
probably
relying
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
had
previously
held
section
5
to
be
exclusive
in
a
situation
where
the
remedy
applies
and
it
acts
against
that
background
just
as
the
court
found
in
parker,
that
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
of
1927,
was
acting
against
the
background
of
the
jensen
line
without
examining
the
validity
of
the
jensen
line
as
such.
similarly
here,
even
in
davis,
which
is
the
very
case
upon
which
appellees
rely
to
create
the
doctrine
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
you
have
this
court
saying
that
of
course
if
federal
coverage
were
clear,
the
federal
remedy
would
be
exclusive.
and
i
think
that
in
--
in
that
context,
section
5
and
the
elimination
of
the
state
law
proviso
along
with
the
affirmative
expansion
of
jurisdiction
which
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
both
northeast
terminals
and
in
pfeiffer
manifest
the
congressional
intent
to
occupy
the
field.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
your
honor
it's
not
--
it's
not
clear.
they
rely
--
they
simply
cite
the
section
5
but
i
think
either
--
either
reasoning
is
passed.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
--
i
agree
that
it
was
assumed
that
there
was
but
i
don't
think
either
calbeck
or
davis
compelled
that
result.
first
of
all,
calbeck's
--
by
its
own
terms
says
it
wasn't
addressing
the
question
of
section
5.
it
had
no
need
to
because
you're
having
a
claiming
of
the
federal
remedy.
secondly,
calbeck,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
read
as
creating
concurrent
jurisdiction
depends
upon
the
proviso
and
the
continued
viability
of
the
maritime
--
the
local
exception
which
prior
to
calbeck
had
been
--
had
been
read
as
being
embodied
within
the
proviso.
in
1972,
the
proviso
goes
and
i
submit
with
it
any
notion
that
calbeck
supports
concurrent
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
calbeck
was
modified
in
another
way
in
1972
because
the
holding
in
calbeck
was
that
if
you're
injured
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
that
you
have
a
federal
remedy.
in
1972,
congress
i
think
has
made
it
plain
that
that
even
is
not
necessarily
true
because
you
have
to
also
be
engaged
in
maritime
activity
or
meet
the
status
test.
now,
i
appreciate
that
at
some
point,
you
may
run
into
the
kind
of
situation
where
the
states
aroused
it
and
if
it's
not
maritime
act
--
it
--
it's
not
maritime
activity
that
this
court
may
have
to
resolve
that
question,
but
it
is
surely
not
presented
here.
so
calbeck
itself
was
substantially
modified
in
1972
both
as
to
its
affirmative
ground
and
as
to
the
questions
that
it
left
answered.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
we
think
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
evidenced
in
the
language
of
the
statute
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history,
manifest
congressional
intent
to
adopt
a
uniform
system
which
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
simply
is
not
and
cannot
be.
indeed,
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
would
create
the
very
kind
of
problem
that
congress
addressed
here
because
as
we've
already
noted,
there
is
some
limit
to
the
ability
of
the
states
to
provide
the
remedy.
thus,
if
we
take
a
law
--
a
shipbuilder
who
spends
part
of
his
time
in
the
shops
upon
the
ways,
upon
the
land,
if
you
will,
at
sun
ship,
and
part
of
his
day
working
in
a
dry
dock
or
in
a
vessel
floating
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
if
he
is
injured,
seaward
of
the
jensen
line,
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
plainly
not
available
to
him.
only
the
employee
injured
on
land
has
two
remedies.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
concurrent
jurisdiction
really
before
1972
and
thus,
in
order
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
shipbuilder
or
the
ship
repairman
who
moves
both
on
to
and
off
of
the
navigable
waters,
if
by
force
--
fortuitous
circumstances
he's
injured
on
land,
now
has
two
remedies,
that
that
also
runs
counter
to
the
congressional
intent
to
provide
a
uniform
remedy
because
he
provides
a
disparate
remedy
and
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
employee
injured
upon
land
in
a
better
situation
than
the
maritime
worker
injured
upon
the
water.
in
addition,
the
other
anomaly
that
might
result
if
we
were
to
find
--
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
exists
is
that
a
worker
who
received
an
award
under
a
state
statute
which
makes
a
state
remedy
exclusive
of
every
other
remedy,
for
example,
taxes
which
is
the
statute
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
magnolia
power,
maybe
barred
by
operation
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
28
u.s.c.
1738
from
recovering
his
longshoremen's
remedy.
and
if
the
taxes
remedy
as
justice
keith
so
plainly
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
johnson
case
is
a
remedy
that
is
a
lesser
remedy,
it
does
not
provide
the
claimant
with
the
kind
of
recovery
that
--
that
congress
provided
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
that
was
all,
thus
plainly
anomalous,
and
contrary
the
congressional
purpose.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
congressional
remedy
is
complete.
it
covers
every
aspect
of
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
once
an
injury
triggers
its
application.
the
terms
and
body
of
legislative
judgment
concerning
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
employers
and
it
was
--
that
judgment
which
congress
has
made
and
the
states
under
the
circumstances
are
not
free
to
modify,
interfere
with,
even
compliment
or
adjust
the
congressional
judgment
as
to
those
rights
and
liabilities.
this
actually
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
when
you
think
about
the
problems
that
the
two
legislatures,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
and
the
congress
are
facing.
pennsylvania's
act
is
a
statute
of
general
application
and
applies
to
all
employment
situations
in
the
commonwealth
while
the
longshoremen's
act
as
a
special
statute
dealing
with
special
occupations
and
embodying
congress's
judgment
about
how
such
injury
should
be
compensated.
and
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
has
been
found
particularly
competent
to
operate
and
where
it
does
affirmatively
operate,
uniform
effect
is
given
to
its
statutory
enactments.
pennsylvania
on
the
other
hand,
it's
interest
here
in
compensating
maritime
workers
is
no
different
than
its
interest
in
compensating
employees
generally.
it
has
no
special
interest
in
this
case.
and
indeed,
the
workmen's
compensation
appeal
board,
advised
this
court
through
its
clerk
when
asked
whether
it
wanted
to
submit
a
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss
under
rule
16
that
pennsylvania
had
no
interest
adverse
to
that
of
the
appellant,
no
interest
adverse
to
that
of
sun
ship.
so
this
is
not
a
situation
where
you
have
a
state
here
claiming
some
special
interest
or
right
which
again
distinguishes
the
situation
from
askew.
finally,
the
acts
when
put
together
and
as
you
look
at
them
from
provision
to
provision,
there
are
plain
conflicts
because
a
workmen's
compensation
statute
is
and
represents
an
entire
balancing
of
the
rights
and
remedies
and
liabilities
and
obligation
to
the
parties,
you
cannot
really
effectively
start
to
look
only
at
a
specific
conflict
and
say,
“well,
because
of
that
specific
conflict,
pennsylvania
is
ousted
here,
but
the
rest
of
its
remedy
is
available
provided
there's
no
specific
conflict.”
there's
a
specific
conflict
right
here
in
the
disfigurements
that
are
at
issue
here.
pennsylvania
applies
different
standards
for
recovery.
pennsylvania
provides
a
remedy
for
disfigurement
to
different
parts
of
the
body.
now,
admittedly,
pennsylvania's
act
might
have
provided
a
higher
recovery.
none
of
the
claimants
here
of
course
received
more
than
the
remedy
provided
under
the
federal
statute
which
has
but
a
single
standard
for
recovery.
and
moreover,
the
pennsylvania
awards
here
were
reduced
by
counsel
fees.
that
is
not
the
way
the
longshoremen's
act
work.
in
contested
cases,
the
counsel
fee
is
an
add-on,
an
additional
payment
by
the
employer.
so
in
summary,
we
have
a
total
occupation
to
the
field
and
we
think
an
express
intent
that
that
federal
remedy
will
operate
exclusively.
it
is
a
complete
remedy
and
it
actually
conflicts
in
many
respects
not
just
in
the
area
of
disfigurement,
maximum
compensation,
treatment
of
occupational
disease,
definition
to
the
injury,
scheduled
losses,
limitation
periods,
the
notice
of
injury
provisions,
they're
all
different.
and
in
that
situation,
we
think
that
the
court
should
give
full
effect
to
the
congressional
mandate
and
the
congressional
remedy
by
holding
that
pennsylvania
may
not
provide
a
remedy
to
injured
maritime
workers
whose
claims
fall
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
like
to
respond
very
briefly
to
what
i
think
are
irrelevant
facts,
but
nonetheless,
wholly
and
accurately
stated
by
counsel
for
appellee.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
three
of
the
claimants
in
this
case,
messers
field,
(inaudible)
and
moore
filed
claims
for
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
in
point
of
fact,
the
records
of
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
will
reveal
that
sun
ship,
then
the
sun
ship
building
and
dry
dock
company
filed
first
reports
of
injury
in
the
case
of
mr.
fields
and
in
the
case
of
mr.
moore
--
and
in
the
case
of
mr.
moore
long
before
he
filed
his
federal
claim
and
all
of
the
federal
claims
--
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
it
is
not
in
this
record
but
i
--
i
don't
think
the
facts
are
relevant
in
either
event
but
i
--
i
could
not
let
the
statements
go
uncorrected.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
elimination
of
the
proviso,
whatever
calbeck
meant
or
didn't
mean,
congress
was
absolutely
clear
in
1972
because
it
adverted
specifically
to
the
deletion
of
the
proviso
and
whatever
it
thought
it
meant
and
that
is
in
the
section
by
section
review
of
the
bill's
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffery
c.
hayes
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
with
that
statement.
securing
of
payment
simply
means
making
provision
for
payment
of
awards
if
compensation
is
payable.
no
compensation
was
payable
under
this
act
either
voluntarily
or
pursuant
to
an
award.
sun
ship
has
secured
pay
--
has
secured
payment
for
all
compensation
claims
through
it's
self
insurance
system
and
that's
what
the
section
5
reference
means.
