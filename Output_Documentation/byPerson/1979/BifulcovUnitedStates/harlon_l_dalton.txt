mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
like
petitioner
we
began
by
focusing
on
the
statute
itself
and
in
particular
on
the
statute
as
whole
and
determine
what
can
be
--
what
--
what
guidance
can
be
drawn
from
the
structure
of
the
statute.
sections
841
through
845
of
title
xxi
define
various
drug
related
substantive
offenses
and
fits
penalties
for
committing
them.
section
846,
the
attempt
and
conspiracy
section,
makes
unlawful
an
attempt
or
conspiracy
to
commit
one
of
those
substantive
offenses
and
--
however,
section
846
does
not
itself
define
the
conduct
which
if
attempted
or
planned
with
constitute
in
offense
nor
does
it
create
sound
penalty
or
sentencing
scheme.
instead
section
846
looks
to
the
substantive
offenses
and
takes
from
them,
borrows
from
them,
draws
from
them
the
penalty
schemes
that
are
included
in
those
substantive
offenses.
thus,
whether
the
one
looks
at
section
846
as
active
or
passive
as
a
referencing
statute
or
as
a
conduit,
the
language
doesn't
matter.
the
reality
is
that
section
846
derives
its
meaning,
its
very
meaning
and
derives
its
penalty
structure
from
the
substantive
offenses,
and
imposes
the
same
penalties
in
the
same
combinations
as
would
apply
to
a
substantive
offense
that
was
the
object
of
a
particular
conspiracy.
the
fact
that
section
846
refers
to
punishments
“not
to
exceed”
the
maximum
punishments
set
in
the
substantive
offenses
does
not
detract
from
this
view.
true,
congress
could
have
in
--
could
have
stated
that
conspiracy
sentences
must
be
equal
to
sentences
imposed
for
substantive
offenses,
but
as
a
practical
matter
the
difference
between
equal
to
and
not
to
exceed
the
maximum
--
the
--
the
difference
doesn't
exist,
those
--
those
phrases
are
as
a
practical
matter
is
synonymous
because
the
drug
abuse
act
does
not
create
fixed
sentences
or
determine
sentences
rather
fixes
maximums,
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment,
maximum
fines
and
in
the
case
of
special
parole,
minimum
--
minimum
term,
so
that
the
talk
in
terms
of
equality
really
is
to
talk
strange
language
because
there
is
no
fixed
sentence
that
must
be
imposed
even
for
substantive
offenses.
in
other
words,
if
section
846
says,
upper
limits
that
same
statement
can
be
said
of
the
substantive
offenses
which
create
upper
limits
for
the
--
for
the
imprisonment
and
fine
that
can
be
imposed
under
them.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
--
of
the
drug
abuse
act,
we
believe
underscores
this
--
this
congruence
between
sentencing
for
conspiracy
and
sentencing
for
underlying
object
offenses.
the
--
as
mr.
--
well,
the
predecessor
statutes
--
the
statutes
that
preceded
the
drug
abuse
act,
all
provided
for
(inaudible)
for
congruence
between
sentences
imposed
for
conspiracy
and
sentences
imposed
for
substantive
offenses.
in
1969,
the
administration
introduced
a
comprehensive
bill
which
was
designed
to
make
many
changes
in
existing
law,
to
consolidate
existing
law,
to
change
the
penalty
scheme.
however,
and
indeed
that
bill
in
every
one
of
its
incarnations,
they'd
create
a
separate
sections
for
conspiracy
which
should
not
in
the
case
prior
to
1970
or
1969.
but
at
no
point
the
congress
change
the
basic
congruity
between
sentencing
for
conspiracy
in
substantive
offenses.
in
fact
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
petitioners
in
their
reply
brief
i
believe
at
page
7
conceive
that
this
initial
draft,
the
initial
bill
that
was
introduced
in
congress
in
1969,
created
punishments
for
conspiracy
that
would
“identical
quoting
from
their
brief
to
sentences
that
would
be
imposed
for
related
substantive
offenses”.
now,
at
no
point
during
congress's
consideration
of
--
of
that
bill,
was
there
any
indication
that
congress
desired
to
alter
that
identity
between
--
the
sentencing
identity.
indeed,
the
spokespersons
for
the
administration
who
spoke
to
the
bill
both
before
the
passive
to
special
patrol
--
special
parole
introduced
and
after
indicated
that
the
concept
of
co-terminus
sentencing
was
to
be
retained.
turning
to
section
845,
that's
the
distribution
to
minors
provisional
statute,
it's
quite
correct
as
--
as
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
i
believe
that
section
845
is
a
substantive
provision
and
to
that
extent
it
is
different
and
kind
in
section
846.
it's
also
correct
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
that
section
845
is
not
a
simple
referencing
statute,
it
changes
the
nature
what
it
is
referenced.
it
provides
for
at
--
for
up
to
twice
imprisonment
and
fine
and
at
least
twice
the
special
parole.
and
in
for
that
reason,
there
is
some
sense
that
--
that
there
is
greater
need
for
specificity
in
drafting.
but
beyond
that,
the
history
of
section
845
is
radically
different
from
the
history
section
846.
during
the
course
of
--
of
--
of
the
passage
of
the
--
the
comprehensive
bill
on
route
to
becoming
the
drug
abuse
act,
congress
rewrote
virtually
every
word
of
section
845.
congress
altered
its
language
and
indeed
its
--
its
substance
and
during
the
course
of
that
those
alternations
took
the
opportunity
to
effect
to
conformity
changes
to
which
petitioner
refers.
specific
with
the
first
after
section
845,
specified
that
the
purchaser
must
be
eight
--
under
the
age
of
18.
it
specifies
that
there
must
be
a
three-year
deferential
between
the
ages
of
purchaser
and
seller.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
seller
must
be
at
least
three
years
older
than
the
purchaser.
that
initial
draft
tried
to
differentiate
between
narcotics
distribution
and
other
kind
--
distribution
of
other
kinds
of
controlled
substances.
most
importantly
that
that
initial
draft
provided
for
an
enhanced
--
enhanced
imprisonment
that
is
twice
the
imprisonment
but
did
not
provide
for
an
enhanced
fine.
now,
the
second
draft
of
--
of
section
--
of
what
became
section
845
occurred
after
the
concept
of
special
parole
was
introduced,
after
a
series
of
hearings
were
held
in
both
houses
of
congress.
that
second
draft
however,
did
not
plug
in
the
concept
of
special
parole.
it
--
it
tinkered
a
little
bit
with
--
with
that
distinction
that
i
mentioned
between
narcotics
and
other
kinds
of
drug
distribution
offenses.
in
the
third
and
final
draft
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
the
narcotics
are
the
controlled
substances
distinction
was
dropped.
the
age
of
--
that
purchasers
must
be
to
come
within
the
statute
was
raise
to
21.
the
disparity
between
purchaser
and
seller
was
removed.
fines
--
the
fine
that
would
be
impose
if
a
distribution
were
to
an
adult
was
enhanced
along
with
imprisonment,
and
at
that
time
congress
effected
a
conformity
change
with
respect
to
--
to
special
parole.
similarly,
the
history
of
the
second
offender
provisions
which
petitioner
comments
on
in
--
in
his
brief
are
radically
different
from
--
it
is
radically
different
from
the
history
of
section
845.
the
second
effective
provisions
under
went
major
rewrites
by
congress.
they
were
revised
not
only
in
terms
of
their
language
and
content,
but
their
structure
as
well
and
during
the
of
course
of
those
provisions
the
--
the
conforming
change
was
made
in
the
repeat
offenders
sections
as
well.
in
contrast
section
846,
as
it
appears
in
title
xxi
today,
reads
the
same,
line
for
line,
word
for
word,
coma
for
coma,
as
the
section
that
was
introduced
in
the
initial
government
bill
back
in
1969.
there
was
an
aborted
effort
at
some
point
to
change
the
word
“attempt”
to
“endeavor,”
but
that
was
the
single,
the
sole
effort
to
change
even
one
(inaudible)
of
title
of
that
section.
as
result,
congress
--
the
conspiracy
and
attempt
section
became
law
without
congress
have
a
really
focusing
on
it's
--
on
its
precise
language.
nevertheless,
there
is
--
there
--
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
intent
of
congress
to
maintain
the
traditional
congruence
coterminous
between
sentences
for
conspiracy
and
underlying
substantive
offenses.
i've
already
discussed
the
--
the
structure
--
the
very
structure
of
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
in
addition,
simply
logic
dictates
that
conclusion.
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
considers
special
parole
a
needed
and
appropriate
penalty
or
response
to
substantive
offenses
which
can
--
in
fact
involve
isolated
transactions
by
single
individuals,
and
yet
discarded
that
same
remedy
for
those
who
act
in
consort
to
achieve
the
same
end.
congress
fashioned
the
--
the
remedy
of
the
special
parole
in
order
to
impose
--
post
incarceration
--
in
order
to
maintain
control
over
the
post
incarceration
conduct
persons
who
--
who
engage
in
drug
distribution
and
in
order
to
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
repetition
of
criminal
misconduct
and
it
defines
common
sense
to
--
to
assume,
or
to
believe,
or
conclude
absent
some
evidence
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
those
--
those
objectives
only
with
reference
to
completed
drug
distribution
offenses.
indeed
petitioner
cited
no
--
no
reason,
policy
and
no
reason
in
logic,
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
--
would
have
a
purpose
to
--
propose
to
treat
conspiracy
differently
than
substantive
offenses.
now,
petitioner
suggests
and
i
should
i
understand
the
argument,
but
that
if
one
looks
at
the
--
the
pattern
of
--
of
substantive
offenses
to
which
congress
has
assigned
the
penalty
of
special
parole
one
can
conclude
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
assign
that
same
penalty
to
conspiracy.
i
think
this
a
non
sequitur.
first
of
it
--
the
question
isn't
whether
given
the
fact
that
congress
has
a
assigned
special
parole
to
one
substantive
offense
it
sure
logically
would
have
assigned
it
to
another
substantive
offense.
the
question
is
whether
given
the
fact
that
congress
has
assigned
special
parole
to
particular
substantive
offense
it
intended
for
conspiracy
to
engage
in
that
precise
offense
to
be
similarly
punished.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
a
clear
and
logical
sensible
pattern
to
the
--
the
man
in
which
congress
assigned
special
parole
even
among
the
substantive
offenses.
of
the
nine
offense
defined
in
sections
841
through
844,
the
four
most
serious
--
most
serious
that
is
in
terms
--
in
the
sense
that
they
involve
trafficking
in
narcotics
and
in
other
easily
abusable
drugs,
those
four
most
se
--
the
serious
offenses
mandate
in
petitioner
special
parole
term.
now,
it's
true
that
the
continued
criminal
enterprise
section
which
is
section
848
does
not
impose
a
special
parole
term,
but
that's
section
has
a
10-year
mandatory
minimum
term
of
imprisonment.
it
authorizes
to
a
maximum
of
life
imprisonment.
it
authorizes
fines
up
to
$100,000
and
it
provides
for
forfeiture
of
--
of
profits
from
any
continual
criminal
enterprise
and
of
any
property
that
is
somehow
associated
with
the
enterprise.
and
so
in
view
of
that
clearly
severe
set
of
penalties
that
the
fact
that
special
parole
is
not
among
them
is
valid
at
the
moment.
petitioner
points
to
two
other
sections
alluded
to
them
in
his
argument
today
that
petitioner
deems
equally
serious
to
the
ones
for
which
congress
imposed
special
parole
and
yet
which
you
don't.
one
of
those
sections,
section
841
(d)
i
believe
was
not
even
part
of
the
drug
abuse
act
as
passed
in
1970.
it
was
added
less
than
two
years
ago,
less
than
15
months
ago.
and
it
--
by
the
way,
it
penalizes
possession
of
piperidine
with
intent
to
manufacture
phencyclidine
which
is
i
guess
a
more
commonly
known
as
angel
dust.
that
section
841
(d)
was
part
of
an
experimental
statute
as
i
say
passed
to
some
less
than
two
years
ago,
that
was
designed
to
experiment
with
ways
to
deter
abuse
of
piperidine
and
the
section
includes
both
criminal
and
non-criminal
ways
of
trying
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
that
statute
including
section
841
(d)
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
will
expire
in
--
in
1981
by
its
own
terms
absent
further
implementing
legislation.
the
other
section
on
which
petitioner
relies
to
suggest
that
that
there
is
little
rhyme
or
reason
to
the
--
the
pattern
in
which
the
congress
impose
special
parole
is
section
843
which
again
is
different
in
kind
than
the
sections
to
which
special
parole
applies.
it's
a
reporting
section
that
has
to
do
with
--
parties
who
are
--
are
licensed
or
authorized
to
dispense
narcotics
or
drugs
rather
in
do
so
in
a
flagellant
fashion.
and
congress
could
quite
logically
chose
to
treat
those
kinds
of
offenses
differently
than
kinds
of
offenses
that
are
--
which
the
court
is
concerned.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
yes,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
the
way
that
we
framed
our
question
was
necessary
--
to
the
question
presented
in
our
petition
would
necessary
indicate
that,
but
yes
we
do.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
it
has.
all
five
of
the
sixth
circuits
have
agreed
with
our
position.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
with
exception
of
the
--
the
third
circuit
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--
no
the
third
circuit
in
fact
in
that
case
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--
in
california
which
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
exactly
which
did
not
go
to
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
that's
correct.
in
sum
logic
and
common
sense
combine
with
the
structure
in
the
history
of
the
drug
abuse
act
to
dictate
that
special
parole
must
be
imposed
as
part
of
offense
for
conspiracy
whenever
that
penalty
would
be
imposed
for
the
substantive
offense
which
is
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
that's
clearly
congress's
intent,
and
this
court
can
give
effect
to
that
intent
by
concluding
that
the
phrase
imprisonment
or
fine
or
both
is
merely
illustrative
and
does
not
limit
the
penalties
incorporated
by
section
846.
