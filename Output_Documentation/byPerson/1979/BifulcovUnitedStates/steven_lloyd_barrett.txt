mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
upon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
violating
the
federal
drug
conspiracy
law
21
u.s.c.,
section
846.
he
was
sentenced
to
four
years
imprisonment,
and
$1,000
fine,
and
five
years
special
parole.
the
petitioner
subsequently
filed
per
se
a
collateral
attack
on
his
sentence
alleging
that
the
inclusion
of
special
parole
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy
was
not
authorized
and
second
circuit
held
that
special
parole
was
a
lawful
component
of
sentence
of
conspiracy
and
affirmed
the
denial
of
petitioner's
application.
the
issue
in
this
case
which
is
currently
the
subject
of
disagreement
among
the
circuits
is
whether
as
the
second
circuit
held
section
846
includes
special
parole
or
whether
as
we
assert
the
statute
specification
of
imprisonment
and
fine
precludes
special
parole.
the
statutory
language
of
section
846
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
at
page
3,
and
it's
states,
“any
person
who
attempts
or
conspires
to
commit
any
offense
defined
in
this
subchapter
is
punishable
by
imprisonment,
or
fine,
or
both
which
may
not
exceed
the
maximum
of
punishment
prescribed
for
the
offense
the
commission
of
which
was
the
object
of
the
attempt
or
conspiracy.”
we
submit
that
the
penalties
intended
to
conspiracy
are
stated
plainly
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
imprisonment
and
fine.
in
our
argument
this
morning,
it
will
be
shown
that
congress
used
the
precise
specification
of
penalties
for
the
very
purpose
of
providing
imprisonment
without
special
parole
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy
and
i'll
be
looking
at
four
issues
bearing
on
this
matter.
first,
i
will
examine
the
statutory
scheme
and
section
846's
place
in
that
scheme,
to
show
that
throughout
the
statute,
special
parole
maybe
imposed
only
when
it
is
separately
authorized
from
imprisonment
and
fine.
second,
i
will
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
elucidate
congress's
intent
that
a
specification
of
imprisonment
of
fine
in
a
statutory
section
cannot
alone
authorize
the
inclusion
of
special
parole.
third,
i
will
discuss
the
government's
analysis
of
congress's
intent
and
show
that
that
position
cannot
be
sustained.
and
finally,
i
will
consider
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case
under
the
doctrine
of
lenity.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes
i
will
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
turning
first
to
the
statutory
scheme,
special
parole
exists
as
a
punishment
quite
distinct
from
the
punishment
of
imprisonment.
it's
provided
as
an
additional
and
separate
penalty
to
be
served
after
full
service
of
a
prison
term.
now,
special
parole
is
subject
to
no
maximum
limit
so
that
it
can
and
often
does
exceed
the
prison
term
in
length.
this
is
important
because
of
the
--
revocation
--
revocation
rule
which
is
then
upon
revocation
special
parole
a
new
and
additional
prison
term
is
substituted
in
the
amount
of
the
entire
special
parole
term
without
credit
for
time
served.
now,
it's
therefore
a
substantial
penalty
and
congress
authorized
its
inclusion
selectively
by
a
separate
provision
in
each
statutory
paragraph
to
finding
a
crime
to
which
special
parole
would
be
applied.
now,
quite
a
number
and
indeed
the
majority
of
the
drug
crimes
provide
for
imprisonment
without
specification
or
without
mention
of
any
special
parole
and
significantly
the
crime
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
which
is
the
most
serious
trafficking
offense
in
the
federal
drug
law
does
not
specify
a
special
parole
term.
and
similarly
there
is
no
specification
of
special
parole
in
the
offenses
involving
trafficking
by
persons
who
are
registered
under
the
drug
law.
generally
the
parole
--
special
parole
authorizations
occur
in
the
distribution
and
possession
offenses
to
find
in
section
841,
but
even
here
there
is
selectivity.
two
of
the
six
--
two
of
the
six
punishment
sections
in
section
841
do
not
provide
for
special
parole.
now,
in
practice,
there
is
never
been
any
question
that
a
drug
section
which
does
not
make
any
mention
of
special
parole
is
not
entitled
to
include
as
sentenced
special
parole
with
one
exception,
and
that
of
course
the
section
846
which
is
the
issue
that's
presently
before
the
court.
from
the
standpoint
to
the
statutory
scheme,
we
--
we
feel
at
this
unique
treatment
quoted
in
section
846
which
some
--
which
some
circuits
at
least
have
given
section
846
makes
no
sense
like
the
other
sections
throughout
the
drug
law
which
do
not
make
--
mention
of
special
parole
and
which
special
parole
does
not
apply,
section
846
describes
it's
punishments
in
terms
of
imprisonment
and
fine
exclusively.
unlike
these
other
section,
section
846
is
a
separate
criminal
section
under
which
sentences
are
imposed.
the
purported
distinction
for
it's
--
section
846
which
the
government
offers
to
justify
the
inclusion
of
section
--
of
special
parole
in
section
846
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
special
parole
authorization
is
that
the
conspiracy
section
refers
to
the
statutory
section
of
the
object
offense
to
set
the
limits
of
punishment
applicable
to
the
particular
conspiracy.
and
the
government
contends
that
this
reference
results
in
the
incorporation
into
section
846
of
any
special
parole
that
would
be
required
in
the
object
defense
section
where
sentence
is
imposed
under
that
section.
we
feel
this
argument
by
the
government
misperceives
the
significance
and
the
function
of
section
846
specification
of
imprisonment
and
fine.
section
846
refers
to
the
object
offense
sections
to
set
the
amount,
but
not
the
type
of
the
punishment
authorized,
section
846
itself
sets
the
type
of
punishment.
the
accuracy
of
this
reading
is
supported
by
the
house
report
which
accompanied
the
bill
which
is
ultimately
enacted
by
the
congress
and
--
and
in
that
report,
in
a
description
of
the
operation
of
the
conspiracy
section
and
the
--
and
the
penalty
for
conspiracy,
the
house
committee
i
believe
it's
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
stated
--
described
the
punishment
as
imprisonment
and/or
fine
which
may
not
exceed
the
maximum
amount
set
for
the
object
offense
and
--
and
as
this
statement
indicates
the
imprisonment
and
fine
close
of
section
846
defines
the
type
of
punishment
which
is
to
be
imposed
for
that
section.
a
proof
that
section
846
is
--
referencing
structure
which
is
again
the
basis
of
the
government's
distinction,
a
proof
that
it
is
referencing
structure
does
not
justify
any
special
treatment
is
clear
from
another
section
of
the
drug
law.
now,
that's
the
section
that's
numerically
proceeds
section
846
--
section
845.
it's
set
forth
in
footnote
25
of
our
brief
at
page
20
and
that's
the
distribution
to
minor
section.
now,
section
845
like
section
846,
uses
reference
to
another
sections
sentencing
limits
but
there's
a
very
significant
distinction
of
the
face
of
the
two
statutes.
whereas
section
846
as
i've
indicated
specifies,
in
one
clause,
imprisonment
or
fine
or
both,
section
845
has
two
clauses.
the
first
clause
specifies
a
reference
for
imprisonment
and
fine,
and
that
in
that
sense
reassembles
section
846,
but
there
is
a
separate
second
clause
which
provides
for
the
incorporation
of
special
parole.
i
have
more
to
say
that
section
845
in
my
legislative
history
discussion
but
for
the
present
it
bears
noting
that
section
845
shows
that
the
characteristic
that
i've
identified
in
the
drug
law,
and
that
is
--
that
before
special
parole
is
included
in
the
section,
there
must
be
a
specific
--
special
parole
authorization
in
the
individual
section.
that
section
845
shows
that
that
--
that
characteristic
or
that
rule
applies
to
sections
which
used
referencing
and
that
therefore
section
846
should
not
be
treated
unusually,
it
should
be
treated
like
all
the
other
sections
throughout
the
drug
law
which
do
not
makes
specific
reference
to
special
parole,
it
should
be
in
other
words
no
special
parole
should
be
authorized.
and
looking
out
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
confirms
that's
the
specification
of
imprisonment
and
fine
in
section
846
was
intended
to
define
a
punishment
which
would
not
include
special
parole.
in
particular,
two
points
are
established
in
legislative
history.
first,
as
the
sections
which
like
this
conspiracy
section
used
referencing
to
another
section
to
establish
the
amount
of
penalty
available,
congress
recognized
the
need
for
a
separate
special
parole
authorization
in
a
section
employing
the
reference
if
that
section
was
to
include
special
parole.
and
the
second
thing
that
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
is
that
congress
added
special
parole
clauses
to
other
sections
which
employed
this
referencing,
but
it
did
not
so
add
a
special
parole
clause
to
section
846.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
don't
think
so.
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
happenstance
of
the
way
the
--
the
initial
bills
were
drafted,
but
i
think
that
there
are
--
are
two
important
reasons
why
we
should
not
find
that
the
original
formulation
of
the
bills
before
the
inclusion
of
special
parole
indicates
an
intent
to
have
--
if
i
could
use
the
government's
word
in
this
congruence
between
the
two
sections,
the
conspiracy
section
and
the
operative
section.
the
--
the
first
reason
why
has
to
do
with
the
--
the
structure
of
the
new
drug
law.
in
the
former
law,
conspiracy
was
within
the
--
the
specific
substantive
sections
and
in
every
bill
considers
for
the
new
law,
conspiracy
was
withdrawn
from
the
substantive
section
and
established
in
its
own
section.
now,
we
feel
that
--
if
you
look
trough
other
penal
sections
throughout
the
united
states
code,
you
find
that
when
conspiracy
is
separated
from
the
substantive
offense,
generally
the
sentences
provided
are
disparate
rather
than
congruent.
and
that
you
find
congruence
in
a
sense
in
--
in
cases
in
which
the
conspiracy
section
is
allowed
to
remain
within
the
substantive
offense
section.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
when
congress,
the
91st
congress
removed
conspiracy
from
the
substantive
offense
section.
in
this
case,
it
was
intending
to
create
this
word
--
sentences
or
necessitates
the
finding
of
these
current
sentences.
what
i'm
saying,
is
that
it
was
originally
in
a
situation
where
congruence
was
necessitated
and
it
was
thereafter
placed
in
a
situation
were
traditionally
congruence
was
not
found
and
i
think
to
that
sort
of
refutes
the
thought
that
congress
was
thinking
specifically
in
terms
of
establishing
congruence.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
the
general
conspiracy
statute
would
have
required
a
specific
term
of
five
years.
no,
it's
--
the
general
conspiracy
section
would
not
have
allowed
any
flexibility
or
differentiation
between
of
various
conspiracy
sections.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
have
accomplished
their
purpose.
i
think
that
there's
one
of
the
--
there's
one
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
that
as
to
this
--
this
question
of
whether
the
--
the
initial
bill
intended
to
have
the
similar
treatment
and
that
is
to
use
to
the
language
in
every
bill
which
the
91st
congress
considered
in
section
846
or
in
--
in
the
predecessor
to
the
section
846
and
in
no
bill
that
congress
specify
that
punishment
for
conspiracy
was
subject
to
punishment
equal
to
that
of
the
substantive
section.
it
always
used
the
term
which
may
not
exceed.
now
to
be
sure,
using
a
term
which
may
not
exceed
allows
for
the
possibility
that
the
sentences
will
be
the
same,
but
congress
is
free
also
to
use
their
equal
to
and
equal
to
connotes
something
quite
different
than
which
may
not
exceed.
and
--
and
my
point
again
in
this,
is
that
i
think
that
reflects
that
congress
was
not
thinking
specifically
of
setting
up
this
equality.
equalization
was
not
on
there
mind
when
they
drew
this
section.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
well,
let
me
--
let
me
say
this,
the
--
the
suggestion
that
you've
made
is
that
in
the
initial
bills
the
--
before
special
parole
is
added
there
happened
to
be
this
relationship
say
that
--
that
the
same
kind
of
term
was
specified.
the
basis
of
--
of
a
conclusion
from
that
fact
that
congress
intended
just
to
be
the
case
was
specifically
the
language
and
a
structure
of
these
two
sections.
why
not
if
you
use
that
same
standard
of
an
analysis,
say
that
after
special
parole
was
added,
and
after
the
one
section
had
special
parole
and
another
one
didn't,
since
your
--
your
analysis
is
based
on
the
construction
of
the
statutes
as
they
exist
or
after
special
parole
existed
taking
the
statute
as
on
their
face,
there
was
not
this
congruence
any
longer.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
right.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
right.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
okay.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
would
not
be
a
permissible
inference
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
they
did
not
only
say
in
section
846
that
attempt
and
conspiracy
are
punishable
the
same
way
as
substantive
offenses.
they
said
two
things,
they
said
it's
punishable
--
they
said
primarily,
that
it's
punishable
by
imprisonment
and
fine.
in
order
words,
if
you're
taking
a
section,
if
you
take
section
846
and
cross
out
the
provision
that
it's
punishable
by
imprisonment
and
fine,
and
just
have
the
--
you
just
what's
left
being
the
person
who
violates
the
conspiracy
section
is
punishable
not
to
exceed
--
is
subject
to
punishment
not
to
exceed
the
etcetera,
you'd
have
your
result
and
it
would
--
and
--
and
you'd
be
perfectly
correct
in
--
in
make
the
inference
that
this
section
would
trace
the
substantive
section,
but
that's
not
what
section
846
did.
846
specified
imprisonment
and
fine.
now,
the
--
the
key
reason,
the
reason
why
that's
of
such
this
significance
is
because
of
the
way
congress
dealt
with
section
845.
now,
section
845
in
the
--
in
the
initial
bills
--
section
845
and
846
reassembled
each
other
before
special
parole
that
is,
in
that
both
of
them
specified
imprisonment
and
fine.
both
of
them
had
referencing,
and
both
of
them
specified
that
the
reference
applied
to
imprisonment
and
fine.
in
that
sense
then,
both
of
them
were
subject
to
a
very
similar
consequence,
and
that
is
that,
they
did
not
specify
special
parole,
but
the
sections
to
which
of
both
of
them
could
refer
might
specify
special
parole
because
special
parole
had
been
--
had
been
entered
into
the
bills
at
the
time
when
both
section
845,
the
distribution
to
minors
and
846
the
conspiracy
section
still
did
not
have
those
sections.
now
what
congress
did
in
h.r.
18583,
was
that
it
added
a
separate
--
separate
clause
to
the
distribution
to
minor
section
whereas
originally
it
specified
only
that
section
845
is
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
or
fine,
or
both
up
to
the
twice
that
authorizing
this
-
the
substantive
offense
section,
now
it
had
a
separate
section
that
said
at
least
twice
any
special
parole
term
authorized
by
the
substantive
section.
and
this
indicates
that
congress
felt
that
the
imprisonment
and
fine
specification
was
not
adequate
to
bring
in
special
parole.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes,
but
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
really
makes
much
distinction
--
difference
in
that
the
--
the
key
similarity
between
845
and
846
is
they
both
use
reference.
that
i
think
is
what's
key
--
the
--
the
analysis
that
we've
offered,
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
question
of
substantive
and
conspiratorial
distinction
is
not
as
important
as
the
fact.
that
both
these
crimes
are
structured
--
both
these
sections
are
structured
identically.
they
both
use
reference
and
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
don't
think
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
(voice

i
--
i
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
well,
the
--
the
statute
has
provided
--
section
845
has
provided,
would
very
well
easily
have
been
interpreted
twice
the
special
parole
because
of
the
fact
that
it
originally
provided
for
a
term
of
imprisonment
or
fine
or
both
up
to
twice
that
authorized.
as
that
providing
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
--
if
they
were
going
to
double
the
special
parole
term.
if
you
--
if
you're
going
to
assume
that
the
imprisonment
clause
of
section
840
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
that's
right.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
there
is
a
mandatory
minimum.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
no
there
is
a
mandatory
minimum
of
special
parole.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
but
that's
--
that's
--
the
effect
to
that
would
--
would
automatically
occur
if
you
double
the
punishment.
in
other
words
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
a
mandatory
minimum
term
imprisonment,
no.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
not
really,
if
you
said
that
the
--
a
person
who
was
subject
--
who
had
violated
the
distribution
to
minor
section
is
subject
to
twice
the
punishment
applicable
in
the
object
defense.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
but
twice
this
--
twice
the
punishment.
in
other
words,
when
twice
the
punishment
of
--
when
--
when
simply
say
twice
the
punishment
of
imprisonment,
what
you
mean
in
context
of
the
statute
is
that
if
a
person
is
subject
of
10
years,
twice
means
he's
subject
to
20
years,
but
there
is
no
requirement
as
far
as
the
minimum.
he
may
still
get
the
same
minimum.
when
you
say
twice
as
far
as
special
parole
however,
because
there's
mandatory
minimum
and
no
maximum,
what
you
mean
is
twice
the
mandatory
minimum
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
--
and
still
no
maximum.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
i
--
i
understand
the
point.
i
--
i
think
that
if
the
same
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
no.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
okay.
i
want
to
just
add
one
of
a
--
one
other
point
to
your
earlier
question
and
--
and
that
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
section
846,
which
is
again
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
it
speaks
of
final
imprisonment
or
both
which
may
not
exceed
the
maximum
punishment
prescribed
for
the
offense.
now,
maximum
punishment
prescribed
for
offense
really
doesn't
mean
anything
when
you're
talking
about
special
parole.
it
only
means
something
when
you're
talking
about
fine
or
imprisonment,
because
those
terms
are
established
as
maximum
terms.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
congress
is
going
about
--
when
it
--
when
it
changed
section
845,
if
it
was
making
the
change
so
that
--
for
artistic
reasons,
let's
say,
so
that
it
was
clearer
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
doubling
--
mandatory
doubling
the
special
parole
and
permissibly
doubling
the
authorized
term
of
imprisonment,
they
should've
made
a
similar
change
in
attempt
and
conspiracy
because
really
on
its
face,
speaking
of
a
maximum
punishment,
does
not
make
very
much
sense
in
section
846
when
you're
referring
to
special
parole
which
of
course
has
no
maximum
punishment.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
twice
the
mandatory
minimum
in
which
special
parole
is
always
provided
as
a
mandatory
minimum
term,
always.
in
other
words,
the
statute
always
says,
that
you
shall
receive
at
least
two
years,
or
three
years,
or
four
years,
special
parole.
it
never
specifies
the
maximum
term.
so
in
other
words,
any
term
from
two
years
to
life
is
always
a
legal
or
in
fact
is
a
mandated
special
parole
term.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
right.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
right.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
sure.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
i
--
i
believe
so.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
would
think
that
--
it's
in
first
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
because
i
think
that
that
is
at
18
u.s.c.
3651
the
probation
statute
provides
that
a
term
imprisonment
may
be
probated,
but
parole
is
a
--
is
a
different
thing
in
probation.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
and
my
--
my
special
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
the
really
three
concepts
here,
the
probation,
there's
parole,
and
the
special
parole.
and
they
really
are
very,
very
different.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
yes.
unique
to
this
legislation
--
it's
never
been
found
--
we
didn't
find
it
in
any
other
state
legislation,
any
of
the
federal
legislation.
and
--
and
i
think
that
--
that
perhaps
you
should
be
thinking
in
terms,
that
even
though
it's
called
special
parole,
you
could
call
it
anything
want,
it
--
it
really
does
not
have
that
close
relationship
to
parole.
parole
is
--
served
as
part
of
the
present
sentence
it's
a
--
you
--
you
have
the
fixed
term
imprisonment.
you
serve
part
in
jail
and
part
in
parole.
special
parole
waits
until
that
parole
term
is
finish.
now,
in
fact
mr.
bifulco
right
now
is
serving
parole.
he
has
been
released
from
jail,
he
is
on
parole.
once
he
successfully
completes
his
parole
term,
in
other
words
he
maxes
out
on
the
--
the
original
prison
term
then
he
has
to
start
the
five
years
special
parole
on
top
of
it.
there
is
no
concurrence
that
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
you
could
call
it
as
potential
imprisonment
in
that
--
in
that
if
it's
revoked
it's
imprisonment,
but
you
can't
call
it
imprisonment,
no
certainly
not.
i
would
be
factious,
certainly
not.
it's
certainly
a
very
distinct
punishment
form
imprisonment
because
to
the
fact
that
the
way
it
is
served,
because
of
the
fact
that
unlike
imprisonment
which
is
--
which
in
only
one
case
has
a
mandatory
minimum,
special
parole
always
has
a
mandatory
minimum
and
because
it
--
it's
subject
to
hold
different
kind
of
revocation,
it's
quite
to
distinct
punishment.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
okay.
you
get
a
five
year
term
of
imprisonment
and
the
parole
board
initially
they
--
they
look
at
the
parole
guidelines
and
they
set
your
--
how
much
time
you
have
to
spend
in
jail
of
that
five
years
and
--
and
when
your
consideration
for
parole
is.
let
say
the
parole
board
says
that
you
have
to
serve
three
years
in
jail
and
after
that
your
eligible
parole.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
oh,
(voice
overlap)
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
specific,
my
--
my
understanding
is
that
--
yes.
you
--
you
are
under
the
control
of
the
parole
officers
just
as
you
would
be.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
well,
it's
not
specified
in
the
--
the
statute
--
my
understanding
is
that
not
subject
to
the
way
the
parole
officer
wants
set
it
up.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
in
that
sense
there's
a
distinction
in
terms
of
what
you
have
to
do
to
serve,
in
other
words
is
think
special
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
special
means
different
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
--
what
extra.
i
was
speaking
about
the
legislative
history
and
i
think
i've
covered
really
most
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
to.
the
--
the
main
point
i
wanted
speak
of
course
was
that
that
section
845
made
this
change,
and
846
did
not
make
this
change.
and
i
think
that
that
indicates
congress's
intentions,
and
i
think
that
in
fact
if
you
look
at
h.r.
18583
which
is
the
bill
that
was
enacted
by
congress,
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
these
two
sections
is
very,
very
clear
in
that
--
in
that
bill
they
amended
the
parole
revo
--
in
a
parole
revocation
section
there
is
a
reference
prior
to
h.r.
18583.
there
is
a
reference
to
special
parole
imposed
under
this
act.
now,
in
conjunction
with
changing
845,
by
adding
the
second
--
special
parole
clause,
congress
changed
the
term
imposed
under
this
act
to
special
parole
imposed
under
section
841
or
845.
no
mention
of
section
846
there.
so
845
is
included
and
846
is
excluded
in
terms
of
--
of
this
particular
reference.
now,
that's
in
section
841
(c)
which
is
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
we
show
that
in
light
of
congress's
act
--
activity
as
to
other
sections
it
cannot
be
maintained
that
congress'
failure
to
add
special
parole
as
anything
but
intentional
and
it
was
--
the
very
purpose
of
keeping
special
parole
out
of
a
section
846
sentence.
if
i
could
try
to
paraphrase
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
versus
sawyer
case,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
congress
intended
special
parole
to
apply
to
conspiracy
despite
not
having
so
specified
where
congress
did
not
address
itself
to
the
need
for
separate
special
parole
authorization.
but
it's
quite
impossible
when
congress
didn't
specifically
address
itself
to
the
need
for
specific
and
specials
--
to
specific
special
parole
authorization
to
find
in
section
846
the
grant
of
special
parole
authorization
which
congress
consciously
withheld.
we
feel
therefore,
that
the
legislative
history
teaches
the
same
lesson
that
statutory
scheme
does.
and
that
is
that
congress
retain
in
section
845's
precise
specification
of
penalties,
imprisonment
and
fine
for
the
purpose
of
providing
for
imprisonment
without
a
special
parole
term
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy.
my
time
is
almost
up,
i
--
i'm
--
i
just
did
want
to
say
--
speak
very
briefly
on
the
doctrine
of
lenity,
because
we
feel
that
--
we
feel
in
this
case
that
the
statutory
language
and
legislative
materials
lead
to
an
inescapable
conclusion
as
the
congress'
intent,
but
should
this
court
remain
unconvinced
and
fine
some
merit
in
the
government's
position,
we
feel
that
there
are
nonetheless
sound
reasons
for
disclosing
this
case
by
excluding
special
parole
from
this
convict's
sentence.
the
absence
of
special
parole
in
section
846
and
--
and
congress's
addition
of
special
parole
to
other
sections
which
was
structured
like
section
846,
provokes
to
the
very
least
some
doubt
in
our
favor
and
the
most
that
the
government
can
prove
we
feel
is
--
is
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
this
case.
that
it
--
it
cannot
--
it
cannot
erase
the
express
terms
of
the
statute.
where
congress'
unwavering
retention
trough
all
these
bills
of
the
expression
of
imprisonment
and
fine
or
both,
and
therefore
in
--
in
accordance
with
this
courts
long
preference
for
the
resolution
of
ambiguity
in
criminal
statutes
in
favor
of
lenity
and
particular
in
term
of
--
in
light
of
this
court's
determinations
that
lenity
applies
in
sentencing
cases.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i
don't
there's
difference
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
basis
of
the
crime.
but
i
--
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
no,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
it's
with
in
this
court
discretion.
and
i
would
submit
that,
that
lenity
should
be
used
in
this
case
but
in
this
court's
discretion.
i
--
i
think
so
that
the
key
to
the
operation
of
lenity
is
not
the
question
of
the
crime
committed,
but
the
question
of
the
ambiguity
in
a
statute.
and
i
think
that
the
statute
--
well
i
--
i
definitely
think
the
statute
is
clear,
but
i
think
at
the
very,
very
least
our
--
our
points
show
that
there's
some
ambiguity
here.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
i've
never
seen
expressed
the
view
that
special
parole
is
anything
but
mandatory.
mr.
steven
lloyd
barrett
if
it
applies,
it
applies
only
mandatorily
as
--
with
--
with
imprisonment.
i
--
i've
never
seen
any
suggestion
that
it
can
be
in
this
(inaudible).
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
