john
paul
stevens
mr.
barrett
isn't
there
this
difference?
in
845,
they
were
not
merely
incorporating
by
reference
but
they
were
changing
the
--
what
was
incorporated,
namely
they
were
authorizing
twice
the
special
parole
term
that
the
other
statue
would
offer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
had
to
refer
to
it
specifically.
do
i
not
--
do
i
not
correctly
understand
that,
that
845
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
said
that
when
you
sell
to
a
young
person
well
you
get
twice
as
long
a
special
parole
term,
so
how
could
they
have
done
without
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
going
to
say,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
it
anyway,
because
i
thought
--
i
didn't
think
there
was
a
maximum
limit
on
the
special
parole
term
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
so
one
short
of
--
i
wonder
of
what
they
really
--
what
the
really
means
is
that
the
minimum
special
parole
term
should
be
twice
as
long.
otherwise
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
make
any
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
doesn't
--
isn't
the
effect
of
this
to
double
the
mandatory
minimum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
remember,
is
there
in
substantive
offenses,
is
there
a
mandatory
minimum
term
of
imprisonment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
see
--
then
you
did
have
to
deal
separately
with
the
special
parole
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
object
defense,
there's
no
ceiling
anyway,
was
there?
was
there
max
--
is
there
maximum
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
in
drafting
there
would
be
more
occasions
to
spell
it
out
in
845
than
there
is
in
846.
i'm
not
saying
you're
necessarily
wrong
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
related
question,
because
the
--
the
text
of
the
--
the
entire
text
to
the
statute
isn't
in
front
of
me
which
i
can't
find
it.
in
the
terms
of
imprisonment
under
the
substantive
offense,
there
is
a
mandatory
--
is
there
a
mandatory
minimum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
not
i
see,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
ask
you
another
question
just
to
help
me
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
sort
this
thing
out.
in
either
the
substantive
offense
or
the
conspiracy
offense
in
your
view
could
a
judge
put
a
first
offender
on
parole
right
away
or
probation
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
in
other
words
that
authority
would
be
encompassed
under
846
and
in
other
word,
that
would
be
just
generally
included
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
imprisonment
--
fine
--
imprisonment
or
fine
that
would
include
prohibition
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
include
prohibition
but
not
parole,
special
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barrett
before
you
sit
down,
could
you
tell
me
this,
it's
your
view
that
the
special
parole
term
is
not
authorized
at
all.
now,
the
contract
of
you
could
either
be
that
it's
authorized
but
not
mandated,
or
that
it's
mandated
and
entered
the
substantive
offense
it's
mandated.
now,
do
you
know
in
the
cases
that
have
gone
against
to
you,
which
view
have
they
taken
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
--
if
it
applies
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dalton
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
do
you
agree
that
the
--
in
a
conspiracy
case
the
--
the
special
parole
term
must
be
imposed?
