justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barrett
i
think
it's
--
in
your
legislative
history
discussion
you
will
also
take
up
the
time
sequence
at
which
the
statute
was
drafted
and
the
time
at
which
special
parole
was
introduced
as
a
concept
under
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
fair
to
infer
from
your
argument
that
before
congress
introduced
the
concept
to
the
special
parole
into
this
rewriting
of
the
drug
law,
846
clearly
manifested
the
intent
that
one
who
was
--
attempted
or
conspired
to
violate
the
law
should
be
punished
in
the
same
manner
as
the
one
who
committed
the
substantive
offense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
could
have
just
dropped
846
and
punished
on
the
general
conspiracy
statute
if
it
wanted
to
do
that
in
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
you
have
to
prove
more
than
just
the
congress
didn't
mandate
equality.
you
have
to
prove
that
it
didn't
authorize
equality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
--
why
couldn't
you
equally
well
say
that
congress
had
thought
in
1840s
--
in
846,
it
had
made
attempt
or
conspiracy
punishable
in
the
same
--
up
to
the
same
manner
as
it
had
the
substantive
offenses
and
there
was
simply
no
need
to
tinker
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
8
--
846
was
already
in
--
in
existence
saying
that
an
attempt
or
conspiracy
could
be
punished
in
a
manner
not
to
exceed
that
which
could
have
--
substantive
offense
could
be
punished
for.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
after
--
then
came
the
special
parole
terms.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wouldn't
it
be
a
permissible
inference
that
congress
simply
thought,
well,
we've
already
said
in
846
that
attempt
and
conspiracy
are
punishable
in
the
same
way
846
is,
why
fool
around
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
845
was
a
substantive
offense,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
call
it
imprisonment?
