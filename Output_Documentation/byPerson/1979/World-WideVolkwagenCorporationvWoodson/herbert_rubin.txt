mr.
herbert
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
further
variation
on
the
issues
which
were
examined
by
this
court
in
international
shoe,
mcgee,
hanson
and
denckla,
shaffer,
heitner
and
the
kulko
cases,
kulko
case
most
recently,
just
last
year.
the
order
which
is
appealed
from
is
a
final
order
in
--
on
a
writ
of
prohibition
and
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
issues
necessarily
raised
by
this
appeal
are
issues
which
go
to
questions
of
minimum
contacts
and
purposeful
activity,
and
therefore,
i
think
we
should
refer
briefly
to
the
facts
and
the
record
in
this
case.
i
think
your
honors
will
find
that
the
facts
and
the
record
are
discreet
and
limited.
we
have
in
this
case,
first,
merely
the
pleadings.
we
have
a
motion
in
which
it
was
moved
that
the
preceding
be
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
there
was
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
under
the
oklahoma
statute.
at
the
hearing
on
the
oklahoma
law,
the
plaintiffs
had
the
burden
of
proving
the
jurisdictional
facts.
no
facts
were
adduced
at
the
hearing.
all
that
we
have
in
the
record
then,
your
honors,
is
the
pleading
and
there
are
affidavits
which
were
interposed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
here
which
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
at
pages
16
and
18
and
that's
all
there
is.
now,
the
facts
indicate,
your
honors,
that
the
plaintiff,
the
plaintiffs
are
new
york
residents
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
it
was
determined
again
in
the
federal
court
when
there
was
a
--
an
application
to
remove
and
the
plaintiffs
protested
the
removal
and
claimed
that
there
was
no
diversity
because
they
were
new
york
residents.
the
complaint
recites
that
defendant
seaway
is
a
new
york
corporation
which
does
business
in
massena,
new
york.
your
honors
will
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
massena
is
a
community
in
the
northern
reaches
of
new
york
state.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
also
recites
that
world-wide
is
a
new
york
corporation
and
world-wide
has
its
offices
in
orangeburg,
new
york.
world
â€“
the
seaway
company
is
a
local
dealer
which
engages
in
the
sale
of
automobiles
in
massena.
world-wide
is
a
wholesaler
which
has
responsibility
for
the
sale
of
automobiles
to
dealers
in
three
states,
new
york,
new
jersey
and
connecticut.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
would
classify
them
together,
your
honor.
i
take
into
account
the
language
of
the
court
which
talks
in
terms
of
the
differences
have
to
be
differences
in
quality
and
not
merely
a
matter
of
more
or
less.
and
in
terms
of
quality,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
difference,
especially,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
again
to
the
record
and
the
affidavit
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
16
in
which
world-wide
expressly
states
that
its
business
is
limited
to
those
three
states
that
it
has
no
intention
of
doing
any
business
outside
of
those
three
states
and
specifically
has
no
intention
of
doing
business
in
oklahoma.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
that
there
may
be.
there
might
be
other
considerations,
your
honor.
it
would
go
to
the
question
of
the
minimum
contacts
which
exist
and
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
herbert
rubin
here,
the
accident
was
in
oklahoma.
mr.
herbert
rubin
right.
the
--
the
accident
was
in
oklahoma
and
it's
clear
from
the
record,
totally
undisputed
that
neither
of
the
parties,
which
the
petitioners
here
had
any
connection
with
oklahoma
and
no
business,
no
property,
never
they
went
into
oklahoma
and
indeed,
in
the
seaway
--
the
seaway
affidavit
which
is
part
of
the
--
of
the
appendix,
page
18,
i
believe
it
is,
it's
recited
that
they
never
foresaw
that
the
car
would
go
to
oklahoma.
mr.
herbert
rubin
if
your
honor
please,
the
other
defendants
that's
audi
nsu
and
volkswagen
of
america
have
submitted
to
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
subject,
your
honor,
except
for
the
express
statement
by
seaway
that
its
business
is
a
local
business
and
did
not
contemplate
doing
business
outside
of
--
outside
the
state
and
the
express
statement
by
world-wide
to
the
same
effect
that
it
did
not
contemplate
doing
business
outside
the
three
states
in
which
it
was
a
wholesaler.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
--
i
personally
did
not
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--
my
--
my
firm
has
--
has
connections
with
the
other
defendants.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
the
reason
and
frankly
i
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
there
is
such
an
allegation
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
no.
as
--
as
to
these
petitioners,
there
is
certainly
a
disavowal
of
denial
that
there
is
--
any
advertising,
local
advertising
in
oklahoma
or
even
participation
in
any
national
advertising
or
national
television.
they
expressly
disclaim
that.
so
that
all
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
recital
that
the
plaintiff
was
driving
in
oklahoma
in
a
car
which
was
purchased
from
seaway
and
was
involved
then
in
an
accident
in
oklahoma.
plaintiff
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
well,
the
record
doesn't
even
talk
about
arizona,
your
honor.
that
has
been
interposed
in
the
briefs
but
the
record
merely
talks
of
the
plaintiff,
so
far
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
new
york
resident.
mr.
herbert
rubin
driving
through
oklahoma,
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
the
oklahoma
statute
provides
for
actions
against
nonresidents.
it
--
interestingly
enough
makes
two
--
refers
to
two
categories
of
cases
where
it
will
take
jurisdiction,
one,
with
respect
to
tortuous
injuries
in
oklahoma,
one,
where
it's
caused
by
acts
or
omissions
in
oklahoma
and
the
second,
where
it's
caused
by
acts
or
omissions
outside
oklahoma.
if
the
defendant
regularly
does
or
solicits
business
or
engages
in
any
other
persistent
course
of
--
course
of
conduct
as
you
have
it
tracking
pretty
much
of
language
which
we
have
in
the
international
shoe
case
goes
on
to
say
or
derives
substantial
revenue
from
goods,
used
or
consumed
or
services
rendered
in
the
state.
now,
the
oklahoma
court,
the
supreme
court
in
its
decision,
first
determined
that
the
first
section
did
not
apply.
there
was
no
act
by
the
defendants
within
the
state.
it
also
determined
that
there
was
no
act
or
omission
outside
the
state
which
related
to
regular
solicitation
of
business
or
to
assist
course
of
conduct
but
then
by
some
kind
of
a
magnum
leap
and
logic,
it
says,
on
the
other
hand,
we
can
say
that
because
this
car
was
in
oklahoma,
that
these
defendants
derive
substantial
revenue
from
goods
used
or
consumed
or
services
rendered
in
the
state
because
this
car
must
have
cost
a
lot
of
money.
it's
an
item
great
cost
and
therefore,
it
must
be
deemed
that
these
defendants
derived
substantial
revenue
from
goods
used
or
consumed.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
reasoning
is
totally
untenable.
the
conclusion
rests
upon
a
decision
of
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
in
phil
tolkan
case,
which
i
think
is
patently
wrong.
the
tolkan
case
was
a
case
of
an
automobile
supply
dealer,
if
you
will,
in
wisconsin
that
sold
the
jack
to
somebody
who
put
in
to
his
car
and
drove
to
new
jersey.
and
in
new
jersey,
he
was
using
this
jack
and
the
jack
failed
and
an
accident
occurred.
and
it
was
then
sought
to
sue
the
automobile
supply
dealer
in
wisconsin
in
new
jersey
by
reason
of
this
conduct.
new
jersey
said
they
had
jurisdiction.
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
connection,
the
so-called
"context"
was
so
attenuated
that
it
could
not
possibly
sustain
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
same
must
be
found
to
be
true
in
this
case
because
what
this
court
has
done
when
it
removed
the
abstractions,
the
fictions
in
pennoyer
and
neff
and
the
harris
and
balk,
this
court
was
seeking
to
find
something
more
objective,
more
real
on
which
decisions
could
be
made,
so
in
international
shoe
those
formulate
of
a
concept
of
minimum
context
and
we
have
the
concept
of
purposeful
activity.
we're
talking
about
action,
movements,
some
--
something
real,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
which
the
respondents
here
take
is
a
kind
of
a
movement
back
to
the
abstraction,
to
the
fictions
which
this
court
is
trying
to
sweep
away.
they
talk
in
terms
of
what
is
fair.
they
talk
about
what
is
reasonable
and
what
they
are
doing
is
ignoring
the
specific
fact
patents
which
gave
rise
to
the
annunciation
of
the
doctrines
which
we
find
now
as
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
this
--
by
this
court
in
the
cases
which
we
have
mentioned.
we
don't
have
to
review,
of
course,
the
facts
which
are
--
which
underlie
the
decisions
in
the
international
shoe
case,
but
of
course,
there
was
persistent
and
regular
solicitation
and
there
was
a
showing,
hotel
showing
in
which
the
defendant
came
into
the
state,
mcgee,
of
course,
who
had
the
insurance
policy
which
was
being
serviced.
and
in
hanson,
you
had
--
where
the
court
found
there
were
insufficient
contacts
despite
the
communications
which
went
between
the
trust
company
in
delaware
and
the
(inaudible)
in
--
in
florida
and
in
shaffer
you
had
a
discreet
contact.
presumably,
you
have
the
stock
certificates
which
were
owned
by
the
defendants.
of
course,
that
was
not
sufficient
and
in
kulko,
the
court
went
even
further
it
seems
to
me.
kulko
is
a
kind
of
a
fortiori
case.
i
note
that
the
--
some
members
of
the
court
felt
that
there
were
sufficient
contexts
in
that
case
and
they
were
contexts.
there
was
the
father
who
sent
the
child
to
california,
the
father
who
had
the
benefit.
it
was
argued
of
the
law
of
california,
support
from
california,
things
of
that
sort
and
yet,
in
kulko,
that
was
insufficient.
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
any
of
those
contexts.
here,
we
have
merely
the
fact
that
a
car
that
was
sold
in
new
york
by
a
local
dealer
went
to
oklahoma
and
had
an
accident
and
so
far
as
world-wide
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
the
most
that
the
--
the
respondents
can
say
about
world-wide.
they
don't
even
say
they
knew
it
existed
at
the
time
the
transaction
was
entered
into
and
there
it
becomes
a
major
argument
of
this
as
the
name
of
this
company
is
world-wide
and
so
it
must
have
anticipated
somehow
that
it
would
be
subject
to
jurisdiction.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
can't
be
a
basis
on
which
this
court
can
find
minimal
contacts
or
purposeful
activity.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
certainly
quarrel
with
that,
your
honor.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
totally
illogical.
all
the
--
the
court
says
is
that
because
this
car
was
in
oklahoma,
it
was
involved
in
the
accident
that
that
shows
that
there
was
a
use
of
automobiles
in
oklahoma
which
have
--
it
says,
"giving
the
retail
value
the
automobile
that
petitioners
therefore
derive
substantial
income
from
automobiles
which
from
time
to
time
are
used
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
logic
to
that
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
quite
a
different
case.
i
think
foreseeability
is
one
element
in
the
question
of
whether
there
is
purposeful
activity.
and
the
--
the
issue
which
has
to
be
addressed,
i
think,
is
whether
there
is
purposeful
activity
on
the
part
of
these
defendants.
i
believe
the
record
shows
there
was
no
purposeful
activity.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
that
there
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
that
there
was
a
direction
of
the
--
of
the
energy
of
this
defendant
to
getting
the
benefits
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
the
forum.
mr.
herbert
rubin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
the
concept
is
one
of
--
if
this
seller
intends
to
localize
its
activity,
intends
to
isolate
itself
from
being
involved
in
lawsuits
in
other
jurisdictions
and
simply
restricts
its
activity,
then
it
says,
"i
want
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
laws
of
my
state
to
the
exclusion
of
the
laws
of
some
other
state."
mr.
herbert
rubin
well,
if
--
if
the
seller,
for
example,
considered
that
to
be
part
of
his
market,
considered
that
people
who
are
coming
from
that
state
were
buying
its
cars
and
it
was
appealing
to
those
people,
it
was
--
its
advertising
certainly
would
be
a
kind
of
activity
which
might
subjected
to
jurisdiction
in
that
other
state
and
then
its
obtaining
the
benefit
of
the
laws
of
that
other
state.
it's
getting
economic
--
it's
deriving
economic
benefits
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--
from
those
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
would
bring
us
to
a
situation
where
the
involvement
of
the
forum
is
the
result
of
purely
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
people
outside.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
if
it's
purely
unilateral.
i
think
you
would
have
a
situation
which
is
very
analogous
to
kulko
where
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
in
this
case
depending
again
on
the
quality
of
the
contacts
and
the
purposefulness
of
the
activity.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
any
product
can
be
anticipated
to
be
found
in
another
state.
there
are
very
few
products
that
are
--
that
are
found
in
our
economic
life
which
one
would
not
contemplate,
will
find
their
way
somewhere
into
another
state
whether
you're
talking
about
peanuts
or
cotton
or
lettuce
or
baby's
pajamas.
they're
going
to
find
their
way
into
another
state.
i
don't
think
the
contemplation
here
is
that
the
lines
of
state
jurisdiction
simply
should
be
wiped
out
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
major
issues
which
is
before
the
court,
it's
the
ideas
somehow
that's
being
suggested
by
the
respondents
that
the
state
court
lines
that
the
system
of
federal
--
our
federal
system
is
somehow
in
a
historical
anachronism.
mr.
herbert
rubin
if
it's
merely
an
anticipation,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
that
the
--
the
foreseeability,
the
mere
foreseeability
that
something
will
be
in
another
state
is
not
enough
to
confer
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
there
all
that
has
to
be
coupled
with
some
affiliating
acts
which
indicate
an
intention
to
get
the
benefits
of
being
in
this
of
the
state.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
--
that's
correct
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--
that
foreseeability
alone
is
not
enough.
mr.
herbert
rubin
except
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
record
indicates
to
the
contrary
that
there
is
no
foreseeability.
what
is
sought
to
be
done
here,
your
honor,
i
think,
is
to
--
to
blur
the
idea
of
the
federal
system
of
limitation
on
jurisdiction
of
state
courts.
we
have
the
very
eloquent
language
which
was
articulated
by
judge
sobeloff
in
the
erlanger
case.
i
don't
have
to
repeat
it.
i
think
it's
--
it's
very
much
--
very
much
in
point
here.
and
there
are
arguments
to
the
effect
that
there
are
advantages
somehow
that
there
are
efficiencies
that
may
occur
if
somehow
or
other
you
blur
the
idea
of
jurisdiction
in
venue
that
somehow
rather
it
maybe
less
complicated.
if
you
just
forget
about
these
concepts
of
jurisdiction
and
it
maybe
cheaper
or
not
so
difficult
to
people
to
get
together
if
somehow
or
other
you
wipe
out
the
concept
of
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
already
said,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
shaffer
case
indicated
that
if
the
price
of
ignoring
jurisdiction
is
that,
then
it's
just
too
higher
price
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
are
in
an
area
where
we
seek
to
ignore
jurisdictional
lines
where
we
seek
to
ignore
the
intention
on
the
part
of
a
--
someone
who
opted
to
do
--
to
be
a
businessman
in
massena
or
someone
who
opted
to
be
a
businessman
in
orangeburg
and
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
that
there
--
there
would
be
a
difference.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
he
--
he
may
have
an
interest
in
the
car,
but
i
don't
think
that
--
i
--
i
would
think
it's
--
that
you
have
a
question
of
whether
you
don't
have
an
attenuated
situation
merely
to
indicate
that
there
is
a
minimum
contact
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
has
a
mortgage
on
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
the
lessor
of
the
car
has
liability.
he
--
as
the
owner,
he
knows
he
can
be
sued
wherever
that
car
goes.
and
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
the
lessor
--
the
lessor
would
--
where
he
anticipates
that
the
car
is
going
to
be
going
out
of
the
state
if
it's
rented,
if
--
if
we're
talking
now
about
hertz,
i
would
say
that
the
lessor
would
be
liable
--
would
be
subject
to
jurisdiction
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
his
business.
that's
what
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
he's
looking
to
lease
his
car
and
have
it
travel
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--
throughout
the
entire
country.
that's
not
the
business
of
the
person
who
sells
his
car.
i
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
listened
long
but
i
haven't
heard
a
thing
about
state
lines
for
the
federal
system
--
of
federal
court
system
for
the
rights
of
state
courts
to
exist
and
function.
and
i
believe
that
the
comments
by
mr.
justice
sobeloff
become
particularly
poignant
here
because
what
is
being
suggested
here
is
precisely
what
he
was
indicating
could
happen.
he
said
individual
states
could
undertake
at
the
expense
of
other
states
enlarge
the
sphere
of
their
authority
to
nationwide
dimensions
requires
no
flight
of
fancy
to
foresee
the
resulting
maze
of
lawsuits,
adjudicating
interests
of
persons
having
only
the
faintest,
most
remote
links
of
the
state
exercising
authority.
the
due
process
clause
is
not
effective
to
restrain
such
extensions
of
local
power
and
the
federal
system
is
likely
to
be
transformed
into
something
very
different
from
anything
we
have
known.
i
think
that's
precisely
what
we
have
here.
we
have
someone
who
is
suggesting
we
go
--
go
have
some
kind
of
an
idea
of
fairness
as
a
misunderstanding
to
say
the
least
of
what
mr.
justice
stevens
referred
to
when
he
talked
about
fair
notice.
he
certainly
didn't
talk
about
fair
notice
in
the
terms
which
my
friend
was
arguing.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
just
a
case
in
which
a
state
is
reaching
too
far
and
the
consequences
in
terms
of
adverse
results
including
forum
shopping
is
simply
rife
and
therefore,
the
--
the
action
should
be
dismissed,
the
petition
should
be
granted.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
rubin
in
--
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
so,
but
the
theory
on
which
the
claim
is
being
asserted,
the
rational
is
one
in
which
you
could,
as
your
honor
suggest,
to
go
to
minnesota
--
mr.
herbert
rubin
that
--
that
i
think
is
--
is
the
problem
here.
we
are
departing
from
any
kind
of
an
idea
of
firm
guidelines
to
a
complete
limitless
uncharted
maze.
