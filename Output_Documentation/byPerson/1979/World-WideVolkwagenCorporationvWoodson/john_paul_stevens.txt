justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rubin
and
that
said,
you
said
the
record
doesn't
show
why
the
other
companies
did
not
resist,
but
the
record
does
contain
the
complaint
which
alleges
that
they
advertised
nationally
and
specifically
in
oklahoma
and
that
allegation
is
un-denied
so
wasn't
it
fair
to
assume
that
that's
the
reason
that
they
--
jurisdiction
could
be
asserted
over
them
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
the
allegation
is
in
the
record
and
it's
un-denied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
there
is
a
denial
as
to
the
clients
before
the
court
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rubin,
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
you
really
didn't
have
to
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
way
you
did
and
although
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
is
illogical,
if
i
understand
your
position,
what
you're
saying
is
even
if
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
is
right
that
use
in
oklahoma
was
foreseeable,
nevertheless,
there
was
still
no
jurisdiction
because
that
wouldn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
the
same
case
in
--
in
your
legal
terms
as
if
the
customers
said,
"well,
i'm
going
to
drive
the
car
to
oklahoma
and
the
dealer
says
i
don't
care
where
you
drive
it
as
long
as
you
pay
--
pay
for
it,"
and
then
he
drove
it
to
oklahoma,
you'd
still
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
could
assume
foreseeability
and
still
accept
your
argument.
i
know
you're
asking
us
not
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice

by
tire
or
something
like
that.
he's
just
fixing
a
flat
tire,
let's
say,
on
a
car
that's
on
its
way
across
the
country,
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
--
it
blows
in
alaska,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
blows
in
alaska.
the
tire
finally
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
should
say,
“i'm
sorry,
sir.
i'm
not
going
to
fix
your
flat
tire
because
i
don't
want
to
do
business
in
alaska.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
greer,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
state
of
the
record.
in
your
complaint
you
--
you
alleged
that
all
four
of
the
defendants
advertised
the
audi
automobile
in
national
magazine
circulated
in
oklahoma
and
that
national
television
that
appeared
in
--
in
oklahoma,
but
in
the
affidavits
of
these
two
defendants,
they
take
issue
with
that
statement
as
applied
to
them.
may
we
assume
for
purpose
of
decision
that
they
do
know
advertising
in
oklahoma?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can
assume
that
for
our
purpose.
