mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appears
to
be
the
first
case
to
reach
this
court
involving
the
interpretation
of
a
"long-arm"
statute
where
a
product
and
a
physical
injury
was
involved.
changes
in
the
modern
society
have
required
the
expansion
of
state
court
jurisdiction
and
with
the
advent
of
automobiles
which
are
certainly
unique
in
american
life,
it
is
required
the
expansion
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
this
has
given
rise,
first
of
all,
to
the
nonresident
motorist
statute
which
perhaps
started
the
evolution
of
the
expansion
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
as
far
back
as
--
in
1927,
the
court
recognized
the
uniqueness
of
the
automobile
in
american
life
when
they
carved
out
the
automobile
exception
to
the
search
and
seizure
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
it's
long
been
recognized
in
criminal
law
that
you
can
commit
an
assault
with
a
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon
by
use
of
the
automobiles,
so
it
is
unique.
today
we
have
a
national
highway
transportation
safety
administration
within
the
department
of
transportation
who
does
nothing
but
promulgate
standards
and
enforce
them
because
of
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
automobile.
as
the
progress
has
progressed
in
interstate
or
in
--
in
technological
areas
and
in
interstate
commerce,
travel
by
airplane
and
automobile
has
made
it
easier
to
move
from
one
state
to
another.
this
has
enabled
the
litigants
to
defend
the
informed
jurisdictions
with
far
less
travel
than
they
would
before.
but
it
would've
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
in
some
instances,
it
is.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
except
that
--
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
recent
denial
of
a
certiorari,
it's
very
difficult
to
defend
personal
injury
action
several
hundred
miles
away
from
the
scene
of
the
accident
where
all
of
the
witnesses
and
the
scene
of
the
accidents,
records,
doctors
and
so
forth
are
located.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
we
must
consider
the
nature
of
the
product
and
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
that,
this
is
a
mobile
product
and
it's
been
recognized.
in
the
nonresident
motorist
statute,
that's
the
very
--
very
reason
for
them
is
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
but
in
the
case
of
an
automobile,
we
can
anticipate
its
use.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
that's
true
and
i
think
that's
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
if
a
corner
grocer,
for
example,
is
selling
a
toothbrush,
he
cannot
anticipate,
he
should
not
foresee
that
he'd
be
called
upon,
perhaps,
to
defend
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
because
the
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
the
automobile,
of
course,
is
considered
a
--
a
dangerous
instrumentality.
as
far
back
as
hess
versus
pawloski,
the
first
nonresident
motorist
case,
this
court
recognized
that
it
was
dangerous
even
when
used
carefully
and
that
is
even
more
so
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
our
argument
is
that
when
a
seller
places
a
dangerous
product
or
a
product
that
can
produce
danger
in
interstate
commerce
with
reasonable
foreseeability
that
it
will
be
used
in
foreign
jurisdictions,
then
he
should
be
called
upon
to
defend.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
again,
we
don't
think
that
--
that
--
if
you're
considering
foreseeability
as
an
element
here
and
it
has
been
considered
--
at
least
touched
upon
by
the
court
in
these
decisions,
they'll
think
that
he
can
reasonably
foresee
that.
in
the
case
of
an
automobile,
it's
different.
there
is
more
movement
of
automobiles.
they
move
on
interstate
highways
financed
by
the
government.
the
very
purpose
of
the
automobile
is
transportation.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
we
have
the
manufacturer
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
don't
--
i
assume
there
is
an
insurance,
but
of
course,
we're
in
state
court,
we
haven't
discovered
that.
this
is
a
german
manufacturer,
is
the
--
is
the
manufacturer,
audi
union
aktiengesellschaft.
the
importer
is
volkswagen
of
america
who
distributes
all
over
the
united
states.
world-wide
volkswagen
distributes
in
three
states.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
if
we
lose
these
two
defendants,
we
lose
any
tactical
advantage.
if
you
don't
join
the
--
the
--
all
in
the
chain
of
distribution,
you're
faced
with
a
defense
well,
somebody
down
the
line
altered
this
product
or
made
some
change
in
it
or
misused
it
in
the
chain
of
distribution.
so,
that's
why
we
joined
all
those
in
the
chain
of
distribution.
we
would
lose
that
here
and,
of
course,
there
would
be
two
trials
then
with
possibly
inconsistent
results,
one
in
oklahoma
and
--
and
one
in
new
york.
either
way,
the
law
of
oklahoma
applies
here.
the
law
of
the
forum
is
no
different
from
new
york.
we
gain
no
advantage
by
applying
the
law
of
new
york.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
no,
sir.
not
if
we
get
a
judgment
in
new
york
or
against
the
manufacturer,
i
would
assume
that
it
is
collectible
in
a
large
manufacturer.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
the
act
of
the
defendant
occurred
in
new
york
when
he
placed
it
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce,
when
he
put
it
in
the
marketplace.
it's
--
had
its
effect
in
oklahoma.
that's
true.
it
was
--
he
started
a
chain
of
events
which
culminated
in
this
tragic
accident
in
oklahoma.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
it
was
manufactured
in
germany
and
imported
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
under
products-liability
law
of,
certainly,
of
oklahoma,
i
think
most
states
now
all
those
in
the
chain
of
distribution
are
liable
as
the
manufacturer
for
a
defect.
in
this
case,
for
example,
these
two
defendants
could
plead
over
against
the
manufacturer
and
the
importer.
the
fact
that
they
haven't
done
so
is
perhaps
explained
by
the
fact
that
they're
all
part
of
a
large
marketing
apparatus
extending
all
over
the
united
states.
it's
interesting
to
note
when
you
buy
an
automobile,
they
hand
you
a
owner's
manual.
i
think
all
of
us
have
experienced
that.
this
tells
you
where
all
the
other
dealers
throughout
the
united
states
are
located
and
where
you
can
obtain
service.
they
are
in
fact
inviting
you
to
use
service
facilities
all
over
the
united
states.
they
certainly
can
foresee,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
product
is
going
to
be
used
other
than
in
their
little
local
marketing
area.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
believe
that
would
follow.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
this
is
a
design
defect
in
this
case,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
your
honor,
i'm
a
bachelor,
i
have
never
bought
a
toaster
and
i'm
unable
to
answer
that.
[laughter]
the
trend
certainly
has
been
toward
an
expansion
of
state
court
jurisdiction
and
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
they
--
you
first
adopted
consent
as
a
test
in
doing
business
and
presence
of
the
corporation
and
finally,
minimal
contacts.
the
emphasis
is
gone
from
power
of
the
state
in
pennoyer
to
the
contacts
among
the
defendant
state
in
the
litigation.
the
state's
interest
in
the
litigation
has
certainly
been
an
important
factor
which
has
been
considered
by
this
court,
beginning
with
international
shoe,
the
court's
--
the
state's
taxing
power
there
was
prime
consideration
and
in
mcgee,
the
court
recognized
that
the
state
should
gave
an
effective
means
of
redress
for
its
residents
and
had
a
--
an
interest
in
regulating
the
insurance
industry.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
but
oklahoma
has
an
interest
in
this
litigation
as
i
will
point
out.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
these
people
while
residents
of
new
york
were
enroute
to
arizona
and
so,
they
were
still
residents
of
new
york
until
they
reach
their
--
until
they
reach
their
new
home.
that's
the
reason
they
were
still
residents
of
new
york.
but
in
shaffer,
again,
talking
about
the
state's
interest,
you
recognized
the
strong
interest
in
the
marketability
of
property
and
--
and
providing
a
procedure
for
peaceful
resolution
of
disputes.
and
also,
justice
brennan
recognized
in
the
shaffer
case
the
unusually
powerful
interest
of
the
state
over
corporations
domesticated
there
and
the
importance
of
ensuring
the
availability
of
a
convenient
forum
for
litigating
claims
involving
duplicity
of
corporate
officers.
this
court
has
used
different
language
in
describing
the
relationship
of
the
defendant
to
the
state.
you've
--
you've
used
minimal
contacts
in
international
shoe.
you've
also
spoken
of
the
contacts,
ties
and
relations
and
you
spoke
of
affiliating
circumstances
and
substantial
connections
in
the
mcgee
case.
this
is
a
somewhat
uncertain
definition
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out
in
the
kulko
case.
beginning
with
hanson,
we
see
the
purposeful
activity
language
that
is
that
the
defendant
must
have
taken
some
purposeful
act
by
which
he
avails
himself
for
the
privileges
of
the
forum
state.
we
take
the
position
that
when
a
seller
has
taken
some
action
in
his
home
state
such
as
placing
a
dangerous
instrumentality
in
the
stream
of
commerce
or
in
the
marketplace,
he
has
taken
purposeful
activity
and
he
does
meet
the
test.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
if
the
manufacturer
could
foresee
its
distribution
there.
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
in
an
opinion
that
the
automobile
is
a
dangerous
instrumentality,
i
don't'
know
that
this
court
has
done
that
for
a
chainsaw.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
don't
know
about
skateboards
either.
i'm
a
little
old
for
that,
judge.
[laughter]
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
yes,
i
have
to
do
that.
i
think
certainly
a
drug
can
â€“
is
liable
to
produce
death
and
certainly,
it
would
apply
in
that
case,
if
he
can
foresee
the
distribution
of
the
drug.
here,
we
have
a
purchaser.
of
course,
it
took
the
automobile
into
the
jurisdiction
himself
but
we
think
that
that's
different
from
the
ordinary
goods
in
that
it's
more
apt.
it
is
for
the
very
purpose
of
transporting
people
from
--
from
one
coast
to
another.
we
have
transcontinental
highways
running
coast
to
coast
and
route
66
where
this
accident
occurred
is
the
most
heavily
traveled
road,
i
believe,
in
the
--
in
the
world
and
we
can
anticipate
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
--
more
movement
of
automobiles
and
we
could
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
if
--
if
a
new
york
resident
is
going
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
if
a
--
let's
say
a
gas
station
operator
in
oklahoma
fixes
a
tire
and
he
messes
up
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
--
the
job.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
excuse
me.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
okay.
he
looks
at
the
license.
they
say
this
guy
has
got
an
alaska
license,
he
should
anticipate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
he
may
very
well
do
that.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
think
he
can
certainly
figure
that
if
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
excuse
me.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
think
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
we
could
--
we
--
he
could
not
reasonably
foresee
that.
he
would
foresee
that
the
man
is
living
in
a
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
think
he
could.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
[attempt
to
laughter]
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
think
when
we
consider
foreseeability,
we
must
consider
not
only
that
something
will
happen
there,
that
he
will
be
forced
to
defend
there
and
on
the
case
of
the
oklahoma
license
or
the
oklahoma
owner,
he
would
not
anticipate
that
he
would
have
to
defend
in
alaska.
he
would
more
--
he'd
be
more
apt
to
think
he
would
be
defending
in
oklahoma.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
this,
we
were
not
able
to
prove
that
these
two
defendants
advertised
in
oklahoma.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
the
manufacturer
and
the
importer
do.
right.
yes.
so
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
--
it's
not
in
question.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
the
facts
were
not
fully
developed
at
the
hearing.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
how
many
audis
are
used
in
oklahoma
or
how
many
come
from
new
york
or
anything
of
that
nature.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
cannot
recall
any,
your
honor,
other
than
the
fact
that
this
automobile
was
used
there,
yes
and
we
think
that
the
--
the
test
that
has
been
applied,
the
purposeful
activity
test
simply
does
not
fit
the
situation
where
a
product
is
concerned.
goods
travel
routinely
across
state
lines
by
different
routes.
they
may
go
to
a
jobber
in
one
state,
to
a
wholesaler
and
another,
to
a
distributor
in
another
state
and
on
down
to
a
retailer.
it's
difficult
to
say
that
the
seller
has
any
specific
intent
that
they
will
be
used
in
any
--
any
particular
state
and
yet,
he
knows
when
he
puts
some
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce
that
they
are
going
to
be
used
in
different
states.
he
can
anticipate
that.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
mean
any
seller,
anybody
in
the
chain
of
distribution,
your
honor.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
the
--
the
sellers,
all
of
these
in
the
chain
of
distribution
have
actions
over.
it
all
gets
back
to
the
manufacturer
eventually.
they
can
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
massena,
new
york,
i
think
is
well-known
as
a
--
as
a
tourist
area.
it's
10
miles
from
the
bridge
crossing
the
st.
lawrence
freeway
or
--
yes,
and
it
--
seaway
and
close
to
two
canadian
provinces.
he
can
certainly
say
that
it's
going
to
be
used
in
some
area
other
than
his
own
little
marketing
area
and
--
and
i
think
that
he
can
certainly
foresee
that
it's
going
to
be
used
or
may
very
well
be
used.
i
don't
think
he
has
to
absolutely
know
that
this
product
is
going
to
be
used
or
have
some
affirmative
statement
that
it's
going
to
be
used
some
place
else.
he
knows
an
automobile
is
used
to
travel.
why
do
we
have
transcontinental
highways?
why
does
the
government
spend
millions
of
dollars
building
transcontinental
highways
if
it's
not
for
driving
automobiles
and
people
over
them
from
coast
to
coast?
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
think
the
court
might
well
make
a
distinction
between
automobile
because
of
its
uniqueness
and
the
place
that
it
plays
in
american
life,
an
automobile
or
an
airplane.
it's
designed
for
use
all
over.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
same
thing.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
trucks
--
well,
certainly
trucks,
most
of
our
goods
nowadays
with
the
demise
of
the
railroads
is
being
transported
by
trucks.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
sure
i
would.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
not
under
the
formula
we'd
like
to
propose
to
the
court.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
i
haven't
considered
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
think
it
should
be
restricted
to
where
the
accident
occurs.
that's
my
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
don't
argue
with
it,
yes.
the
element
of
foreseeability
has
--
has,
as
i
said,
been
recognized
by
this
court.
it's
been
recognized
in
the
kulko
decision
certainly
where
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
the
defendant
could
hardly
expect
to
be
hailed
before
in
california
court
under
the
circumstances
there
presented.
we
think
it's
entirely
different
situation
here
for
the
man,
who
is
selling
--
these
defendants
are
selling
automobiles
for
use
wherever
the
purchaser
chooses
to
use
them,
of
course.
the
--
we
recognize
the
difference
between
the
choice
of
law
on
the
jurisdictional
inquiries
but
we
were
impressed
with
justice
brennan's
treatment
of
this
subject
where
he
urges
the
court
to
bridge
the
gap.
certainly,
many
of
the
choice
of
law
factors
have
been
touched
on
and
mentioned.
evidently,
it
was
important
to
the
court,
although
not
overtly
recognized
them
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
we,
too,
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
maintain
that
when
a
suit
or
six
largest
suit
in
a
state
with
a
substantial
interest
and
seen
its
own
law
applied
to
the
transaction
in
question,
the
court
could
very
well
act
to
minimize
conflicts,
confusion
and
uncertainty
which
is
inherent
in
this
definition
of
minimal
contacts
by
adopting
a
liberal
view
of
jurisdiction
unless,
as
he
pointed
out,
considerations
of
fairness
or
efficiency
strongly
point
in
the
opposite
direction.
we
should
guess
that
the
fairness
factors
certainly
point
to
oklahoma
in
this
case.
justice
marshall
has
mentioned
the
fairness
considerations
where
he
speaks
of
basic
considerations
of
fairness
as
bearing
on
the
proper
forum
for
adjudicating
the
case
in
the
kulko
decision
and
justice
douglas
remarked
in
the
hanson
case
that
the
question
in
cases
of
this
kind
should
be
whether
the
procedure
is
fair
and
just,
all
things
considered
considering
the
interest
of
the
parties.
it
seems
just
that
that's
not
a
bad
rule.
in
each
of
decision
of
this
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
excuse
me?
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir,
it
--
it
requires
a
measurement
of
the
fairness
factors.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
neither,
your
honor,
i
should
admit
is
a
minimal
contacts.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
mechanical
application
of
that.
and
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
its
--
we
seldom
find
the
answers
written
in
black
and
white
and
even
in
the
gray
area
in
numerable
shades,
so
we
don't
have
a
fixed
standard
that
you
can
reach
in
and
apply
with
no
uncertainty
at
the
present
time.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
--
reminisce
longingly
about
it
at
all.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
the
--
in
each
of
the
court's
decisions,
you've
spoken
a
fair
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
defend.
certainly
in
this
case,
there
is
no
contention
they
haven't
had
fair
notice
and
they
have
been
defending.
they
certainly
had
an
opportunity.
convenience
of
the
parties
has
been
mentioned
by
this
court
in
several
decisions.
in
the
mcgee
case,
the
court
noted
that
while
there
might
be
some
inconvenience
to
the
defendant
corporation
in
that
case,
it
was
not
sufficient
to
amount
to
denial
of
due
process.
we
suggest
that
the
manufacturer
and
importer
here
apparently
saw
no
difficulty
in
defending
in
oklahoma
since
they
are
not
contesting
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes,
sir.
i
say
that
i
have
reached
the
end.
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
to
consider
winton
woods'
article
"pennoyer's
demise"
in
the
arizona
law
review
which
i
believe
gives
this
subject
the
best
treatment
of
any
law
review
article
that
we
have
read
and
suggest
a
new
formula
for
establishing
state
court
jurisdiction.
