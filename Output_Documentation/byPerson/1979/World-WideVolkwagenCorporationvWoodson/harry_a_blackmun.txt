justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
any
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
those
two
parties
so
far
as
the
issue
of
this
case
is
concerned,
that
is
the
distributor
thinking,
“well,
the
things
i
sell
are
more
likely
to
be
used
in
oklahoma
as
contrasted
the
seatrain
who
was
pretty
local”
or
would
you
--
i
take
it
you
classify
them
together?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
least
here,
your
accident
was
in
oklahoma.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
witnesses
to
the
accident
are
likely
to
be
there
in
contrast
to
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical,
had
the
accident
happened
in
pennsylvania.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why
the
other
defendant
submitted
to
oklahoma
jurisdiction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why,
my
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rubin,
did
you
represent
the
other
defendants?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
your
firm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
--
but
then
your
firm
chose
not
to
resist
oklahoma
or
jurisdiction
in
oklahoma
for
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
some
of
these
rental
releases
have
a
geographical
limitation
and
do
you
think
that
presence
of
such
a
contractual
provision
would
change
the
result?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
greer,
i'm
interested
in
the
practicalities
of
this
lawsuit.
you
have
other
defendants,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
an
insurance
case?
is
this
what
it
amounts
to
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
to
--
is
--
is
this
an
insurance
defense
case?
is
this
really
what's
in
the
background?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
all
the
facts
but
i'm
interested
in
why
you
have
to
have
these
two
additional
defendants
when
you
have
the
other
ones?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
your
judgment
in
oklahoma
against
some
of
them
and
collect
it,
you're
not
understood
in
new
york
trial,
are
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
greer,
your
emphasis
on
the
foreseeability
takes
me
to
the
facts
of
the
next
case
and
not
yours.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
your
case,
the
accident
took
place
in
your
state
of
oklahoma.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
the
same
accident
would
be
suable
in
the
state
of
minnesota?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you're
relying
entirely
on
foreseeability,
there
are
audis
in
minnesota
also.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
asking
whether
you
are
restricting
your
approach
and
your
focus
in
this
case
to
the
place
of
the
accident
as
well
as
to
the
--
to
the
form
of
the
instrumentality.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
certainty,
you
don't
argue
to
that
effect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
really
forum
(inaudible)
on
the
suit
where
the
accident
took
place
is
not
a
natural
place
to
sue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i
have
trouble
with
the
rational.
