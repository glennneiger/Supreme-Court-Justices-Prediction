justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
purposeful
activity?
do
you
take
--
what
kind
of
purposeful
activity
would
satisfy
the
minimum
contacts
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
benefit
does
somebody
get?
what
--
what
benefit
once
--
once
the
car
is
sold,
it's
owned
by
somebody
else,
what
benefit
does
the
seller
get
from
the
laws
of
another
state
if
that
car
happens
to
be
driven
by
its
then
owner
into
another
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
example
and
what
--
why
would
--
why
would
it
be
a
different
case?
why
would
the
--
why
would
the
seller
there
perhaps
be
subject
to
suit
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if
it
doesn't
advertise
or
anything
but
something
that
oklahoma
people
just
happen
to
come
up
there
and
buy
some
cars?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
and
then
he
wouldn't
be
subject
to
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
this
case
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
then
it's
just
enough
to
anticipate
that
the
cars
you
sell
will
be
driven
in
another
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
if
the
seller
in
kansas
sells
to
a
traveling
salesman,
sells
it
to
his
next
door
neighbor,
and
he
knows
he's
a
traveling
salesman
who
travels
once
a
week
to
oklahoma,
and
he
knows
the
car
is
going
to
--
go
to
oklahoma.
you
--
you're
position
is
that
--
that
certainly
doesn't
subject
him
to
suit
in
oklahoma
because
all
--
all
that
is,
is
an
anticipation
that
the
car
will
be
used
in
oklahoma.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rubin,
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
different
if
in
the
kansas
oklahoma
example,
the
--
the
car
that
was
in
the
accident
that
came
from
kansas
was
a
rental
car
and
the
defendant
was
hertz.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
you
mean
that
hertz
would
be
subject
to
suit
because
it's
car,
and
anticipate
its
car
would
be
protected
by
oklahoma
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
well,
then
what
about
--
what
about
the
--
the
automobile
dealer
who
sells
cars
in
kansas
to
his
next
door
neighbor,
who's
a
traveling
salesman
and
he
takes
a
mortgage?
he's
got
a
chattel
mortgage
on
the
car.
he's
got
it
in
the
--
his
neighbor
is
paying
it
off
over
time
and
so
he's
got
an
interest
in
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
lessor
of
the
car?
what
--
what
if
you
lease
the
car
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
--
you
just
answered
the
--
you
just
answered
the
whole
case
then
on
the
--
on
the
lessor
case.
you
think
the
lessor
wouldn't
be
subject
to
suit
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
change
the
--
the
example.
suppose
the
manufacturer
of
the
chainsaw
is
a
national
distributor.
he
manufacturers
in
massena
and
he
ships
them
over
the
country
and
he
--
he
ships
one
batch,
he
ships
to
dealers
in
oklahoma
and
they
are
sold
there
and
the
user
hurts
himself
with
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
talk
about
foreseeability,
it
--
it's
not
only
foreseeability.
he
knows
his
chainsaw
is
going
to
be
used
in
oklahoma
because
he
shipped
them
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
he
subject
to
suit
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
what
about
medicine
drugs?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you've
probably
taken
some
medicines
and
drugs.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
if
he
says
--
especially
if
he
says,
"fix
that
tire
real
good,
i'm
going
to
alaska."
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
refilling
station
man
has
to
defend
in
alaska
in
nome.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma.
petitioners
are
a
new
york
wholesaler
and
retailer
of
automobiles
and
they
do
business
only
in
the
state
of
new
york.
one
of
their
cars
which
was
sold
to
a
new
york
resident
was
later
involved
in
accident
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
injured
owner
brought
this
product
liability
suit
claiming
that
the
car
was
structurally
deficient.
among
the
defendants
were
these
petitioners
who
had
no
contacts
with
the
state
of
oklahoma
other
than
the
fact
that
one
of
the
cars
they
had
handled
was
involved
in
an
accident
in
that
state.
the
issue
is
whether
the
petitioners
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
oklahoma
courts.
contrary
to
the
judgment
of
the
oklahoma
supreme
court,
we
hold
that
they
are
not.
the
contacts
the
petitioners
had
with
that
state
are
not
sufficient
under
the
due
process
clause
to
sustain
a
jurisdiction.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
blackmun
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinions
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
joined
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall.
