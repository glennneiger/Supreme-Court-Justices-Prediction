it's
by
the
st.
laurent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
this
accident
had
happened
on
the
pennsylvania-new
york
boarder,
it
would
be
a
somewhat
different
case
than
this
one,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubin,
do
you
quarrel
with
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
on
page
6a
of
the
petition
for
writ
for
certiorari
where
it
says
in
the
first
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
the
evidence
presented
below
demonstrated
that
goods
sold
and
distributed
by
the
petitioners
were
used
in
the
city
of
oklahoma
and
under
the
facts,
we
believe
it
reasonable
to
infer
--
infer
given
the
retail
value
of
the
automobile
that
the
petitioners
derive
substantial
--
substantial
income
from
automobiles
which
from
time
to
time
are
use
in
the
city
of
oklahoma?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
what
if
the
wholesaler
had
been
located
in
southern
kansas
and
although
its
territory
was
not
oklahoma,
it
was
--
it
included
kansas
so
that
it
would
be
foreseeable
that
cars
sold
in
kansas
would
on
occasion
be
driven
into
oklahoma.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greer,
what
if
it
had
been
a
toaster
that
was
sold
in
massena
in
upstate
new
york
rather
than
a
vw?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
chainsaw
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
word
"chainsaw"
which
certainly
is
no
less
dangerous
than
an
automobile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
so,
what
if
in
this
case,
the
dealer
in
massena,
new
york
sells
a
chainsaw
to
a
resident
of
massena,
a
year
later,
the
resident
of
massena
moved
his
--
with
chainsaw
and
all
of
his
other
bodily
physical
possessions
to
oklahoma
city
and
he,
thereafter,
injures
himself
with
the
chainsaw,
can
the
dealer
in
massena
be
called
upon
to
defend?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
exclude
the
toaster
since
presumably
the
toaster
owner's
manual
doesn't
give
you
the
list
of
all
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
different
toaster
dealers
in
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
seller,
you
--
you
mean
not
the
manufacturer
but
the
retail
seller?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
really
affect
the
question
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
whether
someone
has
an
action
over
and
can
protect
himself
under
local
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
was
curious
about
is
whether
your
statement
affected
the
foreseeability
of
the
local
distributor
in
massena,
new
york
foreseeing
that
a
volkswagen
he
sold
there,
would
ultimately
be
used
in
oklahoma.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
automobiles
are
just
per
--
per
se
--
automobile
retail
dealers
are
just
per
se
suable
in
any
one
of
the
50
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that,
of
course,
might
be
quite
a
different
question.
a
worldwide
manufacturer
may
have
to
be
prepared
to
defend
anywhere.
