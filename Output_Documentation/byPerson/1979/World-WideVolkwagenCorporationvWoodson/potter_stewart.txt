a
moving

is
mobile,
isn't
it,
and
long
before
the
automobile,
travelling
salesman
back
in
the
days
since
the

century
had
been
riding
trains
and

whether
it
be
their

the
shoes
they
wear,
the
toothbrush
and
their
suitcase
or
whatever.
their

their

every

is
mobile.
justice

well,
you
can
anticipate
that
a
toothbrush
is
a

is
a
very
mobile
product
and
it's
going
to
be
carried
by

but
why

why
any
less
so
than
the

this

people
have
always
traveled
long
before
the
automobile.
maybe
there
is
more
of
it
now
quantitatively
but

justice

since
--
since
the
19th
century,
certainly,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
interstate
travel
ever
since
we've
had
railroad
trains

of
traveling
salesmen
and
others
businessmen
of
other

justice

well,
i
suppose
your
position
also
would
include
anybody
who

who
in
germany
might
have
manufactured
the
part
that
ended
up
in

a

we
got
nothing
but

i
take
it
that
gas
station
operator
probably
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
every

that
the

who
buy

from
him
and
so

when
they
travel.

it's
rather
a

it's

that's
really
not
a
rule,
is
it?
it
depends
entirely
on
the
subject
of

of
the
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
rule
at
all.
justice

it
makes
one
long
for
the
days
of

with
all
its
artificialities,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
makes
one
reminisce
longingly
about
the
days
of
pennoyer
against
