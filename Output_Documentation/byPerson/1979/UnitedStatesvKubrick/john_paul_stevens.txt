justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
government
try
to
bring
any
of
those
cases
that
were
against
you
here
on
cert?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
understand
your
opponents
to
apply
the
rule
in
terms
of
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
constituted
malpractice?
do
they
have
to
take
a
lawyer's
--
be
advised
by
a
lawyer
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
their
position
in
this
case,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
is
the
harm
plus
the
causation,
you
have
to
know
what
happened
and
why
it
happened
but
not
know
if
it
invaded
any
legal
right,
that
separates
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
opinion
by
judge
tuttle
or
was
his
earlier
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
surprised
you
don't
refer
to
the
seventh
circuit
case
written
by
judge
tuttle
where
he
construed
his
earlier
fifth
circuit
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
dewitt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
agrees
with
that.
there
is
no
fight
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
stillman,
going
back
to
the
standard
for
just
a
moment
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you
about
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
the
urie
case,
which
mr.
justice
rutledge
wrote,
he
said
the
critical
time
is
the
specified
period
of
time
after
notice
of
the
invasion
of
legal
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
accept
that
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
possible
but
notice
of
the
invasion
of
legal
rights
which
--
doesn't
that
imply
knowledge
of
a
possible
breach
of
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
did
rely
on
the
urie
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
notice
of
the
invasion
of
legal
rights
should
be
paraphrased
to
say
notice
of
the
harm
and
its
cause?
