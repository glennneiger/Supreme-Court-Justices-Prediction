ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
review
of
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit
construing
28
u.s.c.
2401(b),
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
under
that
provision,
a
tort
claim
against
the
united
states
is
barred
if
it
is
not
presented
in
writing
to
the
appropriate
federal
agency
within
two
years
after
the
claim
accrues.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
for
medical
malpractice
under
the
act
accrues
when
the
claimant
knows
both
the
existence
and
the
cause
of
his
injury
even
if
he
does
not
know
that
the
injury
amounted
to
medical
negligence.
the
facts
are
not
here
in
dispute.
the
respondent
entered
a
v.a.
hospital
in
april
1968
and
was
treated
for
an
infection
of
the
femur
of
his
right
leg.
treatment
consisted
of
a
deep
surgical
incision
followed
by
treatment
by
drugs,
including
irrigation
of
the
wound
with
a
solution
of
neomycin
sulfate
for
about
13
days.
in
june,
the
respondent
noticed
a
ringing
in
his
ears
and
some
loss
of
hearing.
an
ear
specialist
whom
he
consulted
in
august
diagnosed
his
condition
as
bilateral
nerve
deafness.
another
ear
specialist,
dr.
joseph
sataloff,
whom
he
visited
in
november,
wrote
for
his
va
records
and
discovered
that
he
had
been
treated
with
neomycin.
in
january
1969,
dr.
sataloff
told
the
respondent
that
it
was
highly
possible
or
words
to
that
effect
that
the
neomycin
treatment
had
caused
his
deafness.
in
april
1969,
the
respondent
who
had
been
receiving
va
disability
benefits
for
a
back
injury
filed
a
claim
seeking
increased
benefits
for
the
injury
to
his
hearing.
he
asserted
in
this
claim
that
his
deafness
resulted
from
medication
given
him
by
the
va
and
he
cited
dr.
sataloff's
opinion
as
the
basis
for
this
assertion.
a
va
board
of
physicians
denied
the
claim,
stating
among
other
things
that
the
treatment
--
that
the
deafness
was
not
caused
by
the
neomycin
treatment
and
that
the
treatment
was
not
negligent.
the
respondent
vigorously
disputed
this
denial
of
causation
over
the
next
several
years,
writing
letters
and
claims
and
explaining
why
it
was
caused
by
neomycin
in
the
course
of
appeal
and
remand
proceedings
before
the
va
respecting
the
disability
benefits
claim.
in
may
1971,
while
those
proceedings
were
going
on,
the
va
sent
him
a
report,
a
supplemental
statement
of
the
case
that
included
a
report
by
a
va
investigator
and
this
report
stated
that
one
of
the
doctors
whom
respondent
had
consulted
had
said
that
his
deafness
might
be
attributable
to
his
previous
occupation
as
a
machinist.
the
respondent
confronted
the
doctor
who
had
allegedly
made
this
statement,
dr.
soma,
and
dr.
soma
denied
the
statement
attributed
to
him
and
told
the
respondent
that
neomycin
had
caused
his
deafness
and
that
the
va
doctors
should
not
have
given
him
that
drug.
the
court
of
appeals,
affirming
the
district
court,
held
that
the
respondent's
tort
claim
accrued
for
the
first
time
at
this
time,
june
1971.
so
his
written
statement
of
claim
filed
in
january
1973
was
timely
under
the
act.
the
court's
holding
is
predicated
on
the
view
that
a
malpractice
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
does
not
accrue
until
a
claimant
knows
or
should
know
causation,
damages,
existence
of
a
duty
of
care
and
breach
of
the
duty
of
care.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
we
don't
say
it
is
the
event,
your
honor.
we
accept
that
in
cases
where
you
didn't
know
you
were
injured,
that
it
would
begin
at
notice
that
you
were
injured
by
medical
treatment.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
knowledge
of
the
known
injury,
yes,
sir.
for
reasons
that
i
am
about
to
explain,
we
submit
that
the
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
of
course.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
exactly.
as
soon
as
they
know
the
nexus
between
causation
between
injury
and
treatment
or
should
know
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--
we
say
that
it
accrues
at
that
point.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
your
honor,
unless
you
assume
that
the
va's
denial
that
neomycin
caused
it
or
their
denial
of
liability
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
the
va
believed
up
until
litigating
--
they
eventually
conceded
that
there
was
evidence
that
neomycin
caused
the
injury
and
for
that
reason
gave
him
disability
benefits
in
1975.
but
during
the
time
that
he
was
litigating
this
question
before
the
va,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
va
was
sitting
on
secret
knowledge
that
in
fact
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
no.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
claim
of
that.
there
are
complaints
that
they
didn't
send
complete
records
to
dr.
sataloff,
they
only
send
a
letter
saying
--
but
there
is
no
real
claim
here
about
concealment
or
fraud.
our
basic
contention
in
this
case
is
a
simple
one.
when
a
person
knows
that
he
has
been
injured
and
that
his
injury
has
been
caused
by
a
particular
course
of
medical
treatment,
he
is
on
notice
to
commence
inquiries
into
the
possibility
that
the
treatment
may
have
been
negligent.
the
limitations
period
in
a
statute
of
limitations
is
the
time
set
aside
for
making
such
inquiries
and
for
filing
suit
if
answers
to
the
inquiries
reveal
the
basis
for
legal
action.
in
the
case
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
file
your
lawsuit
within
the
two
years,
you
file
merely
a
written
statement
of
claim
with
the
federal
agency,
including
a
statement
of
the
amount
certain
in
damages
that
you
are
seeking.
when
the
statute
of
limitations
operates
to
bar
an
apparently
meritorious
claim,
the
result
will
often
strike
a
court
and
certainly
a
plaintiff
as
harsh,
but
there
are
nonetheless
sound
and
long
recognized
policy
reasons
supporting
such
a
result.
our
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
statute
of
limitations
indicates
that
congress
enacted
and
has
retained
the
provision
at
issue
here
because
it
accepts
the
soundness
of
those
reasons.
statutes
of
limitations
exist
because
it
is
the
judgment
of
legislatures
that
litigation
of
stale
claims
is
undesirable.
with
the
passage
of
time,
reliable
relevant
evidence
may
disappear
and
it
is
thought
unjust
to
subject
an
individual
suit
on
even
a
possibly
meritorious
claim
many
years
after
the
incident
giving
rise
to
it,
when
he
is
likely
to
find
it
difficult
to
collect
evidence
for
his
defense.
by
barring
even
meritorious
claims
after
an
arbitrary
period
of
time,
the
statute
of
limitations
induces
persons
with
possible
legal
claims
to
investigate
and
litigate
them
promptly.
one
cannot
expect
a
person
to
commence
an
investigation,
however,
until
he
knows
of
something
to
investigate.
that
is
the
reason
that
this
court
in
urie
v.
thompson
held
that
the
action
of
the
railroad
worker
against
his
employer
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
was
not
barred
when
he
sued
within
the
prescribed
limitations
period
as
measured
from
the
time
he
first
discovered
that
he
had
silicosis.
it
was
not
measured
from
the
date
many
years
before
in
the
early
symptomless
stages
as
his
disease
began.
not
until
he
knew
he
had
the
disease
could
he
begin
asking
whether
it
could
have
been
avoided
by
differently
designed
or
maintained
railroad
equipment
and
whether
the
railroads
had
a
duty
to
provide
such
equipment.
to
hold
that
the
statute
had
run
before
he
was
on
notice
to
make
such
inquiries
would
penalize
the
worker
for
what
is
called
blameless
ignorance
because
he
could
not
know
what
was
inherently
unknowable,
the
harm
that
was
inherently
unknowable.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
had
ringing
in
the
ears
and
loss
of
--
some
loss
of
hearing
in
june.
by
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
say
that
his
claim
ran
from
later
than
that.
we
would
say
his
claim
ran
from
january
1969,
which
is
when
--
by
that
time
he
was
severely
deaf,
could
hear
very
little,
had
been
diagnosed
as
having
irreversible
almost
total
deafness,
functional
deafness
and
knew
that
neomycin
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
this
diagnosis
was
by
a
private
practitioner,
an
ear
specialist.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
went
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
he
was
writing
the
va
hospital
for
two
years,
denying
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
would
say
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
this
would
be
quite
a
different
case
if
he
had
not
consulted
his
doctor
and
then
told
that
it
was
highly
possible
that
the
drug
had
caused
his
deafness.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
but
he
then
filed
a
claim
in
april
stating
that
the
va
medication
had
made
his
deaf
and
seeking
benefits
on
that
basis.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
va
denied
it
but
he
was
never
deterred
by
this
denial.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
but
he
didn't.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
is
not
based
on
negligence,
according
to
the
tort
standard.
the
va
standard,
they
won't
compensate
an
injury
if
it
is
an
expectable
risk
of
an
operation,
for
example,
but
they
would
compensate
if
it
was
an
unexpected
and
untoward
event,
i
think.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
whether
or
not
doctors
at
that
time
should
have
known.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
exactly
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
not
attributable
to
the
tort
standard,
no,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
rule
that
the
third
circuit
applied
in
this
case
is
based
on
their
understanding
that
he
knew
causation
and
damages
but
did
not
know
that
it
might
be
due
to
malpractice.
so
clearly
the
rule
that
is
being
tested
here
is
based
on
an
understanding
that
the
person
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
among
the
courts
of
appeal
that
have
cited
this
rule,
the
sixth
circuit
in
jordan,
the
tenth
circuit
in
exnicious,
the
seventh
circuit
in
dewitt,
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
say
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
are
with
us,
your
honor,
but
we
would
say
that
in
fact
the
kubrick
case
is
the
first
case
that
really
squarely
presents
this
issue
because
bridgford
and
some
of
those
other
cases
can
be
understood
as
cases
where
the
plaintiffs
might
have
been
confused
about
the
nature
of
the
injury
and
the
connection
with
causation.
for
example,
in
one
of
those
cases,
the
plaintiff
was
suffering
an
injury
which
for
a
while
he
confused
with
an
automobile
accident
and
was
not
fully
aware,
of
course,
and
the
court
thought
in
fact
that
it
resulted
from
an
operation
that
he
had.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
have
not
tried
to
bring
those
cases,
your
honor,
but
i
think
this
case
presents
the
issue
much
more
plainly
because
we
have
here
so
clear
an
acknowledgement
that
the
person
knew
causation
and
it
can't
be
interpreted
in
any
way
as
a
case
that
might
come
under
a
construction
of
the
rule
that
the
claim
accrues
at
the
time
that
you
know
injury
and
its
cause.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
understand
them
to
be
interpreting
the
rule
rather
broadly
and
we
think
that
the
courts
below,
although
they
claim
that
this
had
limits
and
was
very
narrow,
we
think
that
in
fact
it
is
really
a
very
broad
rule.
the
court
said
that
one
reason
--
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
really
only
recognizing
a
rebuttable
presumption
here.
they
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
when
you
know
knowledge
and
that
you
have
knowledge
of
injury
and
its
cause,
that
you
would
be
on
notice,
that
there
would
be
possible
negligence
but
that
this
may
be
rebutted
in
some
instances,
and
they
said
that
in
this
case
it
could
be
rebutted
because
the
case
was
technically
complex.
and
i
may
point
out
that
respondents
in
their
brief,
at
pages
11
and
14,
say
that
medical
malpractice
cases
are
often
technically
complex
and
at
page
14
they
say
that
just
laymen
generally
cannot
understand
the
issues.
so
i
think
that
really
is
no
limitation
at
all.
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
district
court
found
that
alone
enough
to
rebut
the
presumption
because
the
district
court
said
that
even
in
april
of
1969,
when
he
first
filed
the
disability
claim,
at
which
point
the
va
had
made
no
denials
of
causation
or
negligence,
it
said
the
technicality
complexity
of
the
case
alone
was
enough
to
allow
him
not
to
be
on
notice
of
possible
negligence.
the
government
says
that
when
you
have
gone
into
a
hospital
for
a
leg
operation
and
they
have
given
you
a
drug
that
makes
you
deaf,
you
are
on
notice
that
something
might
have
--
someone
might
have
erred
and
you
are
on
notice
to
check
that
out.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
characterize
that.
we
say
that
when
this
kind
of
harm
and
injury
occurred,
you
are
on
notice,
you
should
be
expected
to
believe
--
we
would
quarrel
with
the
word
"reasonably,"
i
suppose.
we
would
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--
court's
finding
that
he
didn't
believe,
but
we
can't
attack
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
don't
think
we
could
accept
the
word
"reasonably,"
because
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
think
that
is
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
i
am
aware
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
if
your
honor
regards
that
as
a
finding
of
fact,
we
are
asking
you
to
set
it
aside.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that
is
enough.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
perhaps
there
is
a
semantics
problem
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
the
record
does.
it
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
in
january
of
1969,
when
he
was
told
by
dr.
sataloff
that
neomycin
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
oh,
at
the
time.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
he
knew
what
the
drug
was
at
that
time.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
for
that
reason
we
say
the
statute
did
not
start
to
run
until
the
following
january.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
statute
started
to
run
when
he
was
in
the
hospital
or
even
when
he
first
noticed
deafness.
we
think
that
the
rule
that
this
court
applies
in
urie
and
which
was
taken
over
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
quinton
case
is
a
basically
reasonable
rule
if
it
is
interpreted
with
the
limits
which
we
understand
it
to
have,
because
we
think
it
is
reasonable
that
one
would
not
be
on
notice
to
investigate
possible
negligence
until
he
knows
he
has
been
injured.
we
submit
that
the
construction
given
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
would
be
wrong
as
to
any
statute
of
limitations
that
lacks
a
tolling
provision
to
permit
the
kind
of
delay
which
the
court
of
appeals
would
permit.
and
where
the
limitations
provision
is
in
this
suit,
a
condition
on
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
hence
a
provision
to
be
strictly
construed,
we
think
that
the
construction
is
clearly
impermissible.
the
courts
below,
i
have
noted,
suggested
that
the
rule
was
quite
narrow.
they
said
that
it
was
technically
complex
and
that
would
be
one
reason
for
limiting
the
rule
here.
they
also
said
that
because
the
va
denied
causation
and
negligence,
this
was
a
reason
for
saying
that
he
would
not
be
on
notice.
the
denial
of
negligence,
of
course,
is
irrelevant
where
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
that
he
knew
--
the
denial
of
a
finding
of
causation
is
irrelevant
where
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
that
he
knew
that
the
neomycin
had
caused
his
deafness
and,
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
is
predicated
on
that
understanding.
and
as
to
the
denial
of
liability,
we
would
say
that
in
technically
complex
cases
of
the
sort
posited
by
the
court
of
appeals
here,
a
denial
of
liability
by
someone
who
is
confronted
with
someone
demanding
damages
for
his
injury
is
to
be
expected
and
not
an
excuse
for
ceasing
any
investigations.
we
will
concede,
of
course,
that
the
court
made
no
finding,
although
the
plaintiff
was
not
deterred
by
their
denials
of
causation
he
was
somehow
deterred
by
their
conclusory
denials
of
liability.
finally,
the
courts
below
relied
on
the
fact
that
none
of
the
physicians
that
he
consulted
ever
spontaneously
advised
him
that
neomycin
treatment
was
medically
negligent.
this,
however,
is
not
logically
a
factor
supporting
the
conclusion
that
the
respondent
did
not
and
could
not
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence
have
known
that
the
neomycin
treatment
was
negligent.
it
is
itself
a
legal
conclusion
that
the
respondent
had
no
duty
to
ask
physicians
or
lawyers
about
the
possibility
of
negligence
once
he
knew
his
deafness
had
been
caused
by
neomycin.
the
court
of
appeals
is
simply
using
the
conclusion
in
support
of
itself.
the
respondent
begs
the
question
in
a
similar
manner
when
he
argues
in
his
brief
at
pages
14
and
15
that
what
he
terms
a
conspiracy
of
silence
among
physicians
and
difficulties
in
obtaining
access
to
medical
records
make
it
unreasonable
to
hold
that
a
layman
is
on
notice
of
possible
negligence
when
he
knows
only
that
a
course
of
medical
treatment
has
harmed
him.
if
as
we
submit
the
limitation
period
begins
running
at
the
time
the
claimant
gains
knowledge
of
the
nexus
in
treatment
and
injury,
it
is
irrelevant
whether
physicians
are
unduly
reluctant
to
accuse
each
other
of
malpractice.
the
respondent's
complaint
is
more
logically
understood
as
a
contention
that
problems
in
obtaining
medical
testimony
and
in
gaining
access
to
records
make
the
investigation
of
medical
negligence
a
long
and
difficult
task
with
the
result
that
a
proper
claim
cannot
be
prepared
in
the
time
allotted
by
the
statute.
but
the
remedy
for
this
problem,
if
the
problem
exists,
is
not
to
devise
a
rule
that
relieves
the
claimant
of
any
duty
to
inquire
into
possible
negligence
but
to
extend
the
limitations
periods
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
a
remedy
such
as
that,
of
course,
may
only
be
governed
by
congress.
in
sum,
we
have
a
statute
of
limitations
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
a
provision
that
must
be
construed
strictly
because
it
is
a
condition
on
the
waiver
of
the
government's
immunity
to
suit.
at
the
very
least,
strict
construction
demands
avoiding
constructions
that
undermine
the
basic
policies
of
the
provisions.
by
holding
that
persons
who
know
or
should
know
that
they
have
been
injured
by
government
medical
treatment
may
postpone
the
operation
of
the
limitations
provision
of
the
act
simply
by
failing
to
inquire
of
anyone
whether
treatment
may
have
been
negligent.
the
court
of
appeals
has
underline
the
policy
of
encouraging
prompt
investigation
of
claims
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
any
statute
of
limitations.
we
submit
that
however
many
court
of
appeals
may
have
been
drawn
into
reciting
the
rule
which
the
court
below
has
adopted,
that
they
are
wrong
and
that
this
court
sits
to
correct
such
errors.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
rule
was
erroneous,
that
under
a
proper
construction
of
the
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
respondent's
claim
was
clearly
barred
and
we
ask
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
first,
with
respect
to
the
department
of
defense
regulation
that
was
quoted
from
the
steel
case,
i
would
say
that
that
is
simply
another
way
of
stating
the
quinton
rule,
and
we
would
interpret
either
one
the
same
way
as
consistent
with
the
position
we
are
taking
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
said
when
he
has
knowledge
of
the
acts
alleged
to
be
wrongful.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
the
quinton
rule
says
when
he
discovers
the
acts
constituting
the
malpractice,
and
we
would
interpret
either
one
to
mean
when
you
discover
the
acts
which
turn
out
to
be
provable.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
right.
we
think
the
distinction
--
it
doesn't
say
discover
knowledge
of
the
wrongful
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
say
he
was
on
notice
to
start
finding
out
in
january
of
1969
or
april
of
1969
at
the
latest.
and
whether
he
found
out
or
not
during
the
ten
years.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
put
him
on
notice
simply
because
he
went
into
the
hospital
and
was
harmed
by
a
treatment
and
knew
himself
to
have
been
harmed
by
the
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
is
to
consult
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
don't
think
file
suit
but
i
think
investigate
the
basis
for
a
possible
suit.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
we
make
no
such
assumption
and
we
assume
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
most
people
are
not
harmed
by
or
are
not
made
deaf
by
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
think
that
the
decision
would
rest
on
different
issues.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
we
would
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
we
would
interpret
that
to
mean
that
he
has
notice
of
the
possible
invasion
once
he
understands
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
of
course,
in
urie
they
weren't
focusing
on
the
question
that
is
involved
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
do
rely
on
urie
because
we
think
that
on
the
facts,
they
are
similar
to
the
facts
that
we
say
should
put
you
on
notice,
and
i
suppose
we
just
interpret
that
phrase
too
implicitly
in
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
yes,
i
think
so.
also
as
to
the
va
standard
which
he
says
is
negligence,
i
simply
would
refer
the
court
to
the
va
regulations
and
that
regulation
is
printed
at
page
4,
footnote
2
of
our
brief,
and
it
refers
to
--
it
says
compensation
is
not
payable
for
either
the
usual
or
the
unusual
after-results
of
approved
medical
care
properly
administered,
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
the
disability
approximately
resulted
through
carelessness,
accident,
negligence,
lack
of
proper
skill,
error
in
judgment
or
similar
incidences
of
indicated
fault
on
the
part
of
the
veterans
administration.
and
obviously
this
is
a
different
standard
from
an
error
in
judgment
which
you
had
a
duty
of
care
to
avoid
at
the
time.
so
it
is
a
fault
standard
but
it
is
not
the
medical
malpractice
standard.
finally,
i
simply
would
observe
that
the
respondent's
explanation
of
how
the
rule
would
work,
how
accrual
would
be
determined
under
his
test
would
simply
leave
us
with
no
rule
at
all.
there
is
really
no
point
in
having
a
fixed
time
if
it
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
balancing
test
where
you
consider
the
state
of
mind
and
the
state
of
education
of
the
plaintiff
and
whether
the
government
was
prejudiced,
and
so
on.
we
would
agree
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
if
congress
had
intended
any
such
test
they
simply
would
have
said
apply
the
doctrine
of
latches
and
they
clearly
have
not
done
that
here.
thank
you.
