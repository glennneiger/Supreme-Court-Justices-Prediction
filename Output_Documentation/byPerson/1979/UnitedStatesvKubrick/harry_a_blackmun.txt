justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
draw
a
different
rule
depending
on
the
awareness
of
the
individual,
thus
if
the
injured
person
were,
say,
an
elder
laryngologist,
he
might
have
a
shorter
period
of
limitation
than
your
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
will
not
be
content
with
the
standard
of
a
reasonable
person?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
have
a
different
result
then,
whether
he
is
less
than
a
high
school
graduate,
as
you
have
described
him,
or
one
who
has
had
two
years
of
college,
you
might
have
an
extra
half
year
maybe?
