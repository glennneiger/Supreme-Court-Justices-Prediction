justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
stillman,
let
me
just
be
sure
about
what
you
just
now
said.
you
do
not,
as
i
understand
you,
question
the
district
court's
finding
that
in
this
particular
case
the
plaintiff's
belief
that
there
was
no
malpractice
was
a
reasonable
belief.
he
expressly
found
that
and
i
thought
you
didn't
disagree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
asking
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
finding
of
fact
that
was
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
thought
we
probably
had
to
start
with
the
assumption
that
he
reasonably
assumed
there
was
no
malpractice.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
finding.
then
you
are
asking
us
to
set
aside
a
finding
of
fact.

29a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
really
quite
important
to
know
whether
you
are
asking
us
to
set
aside
a
finding
of
fact
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
do
you
interpret
the
ashley
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
be
contrary
to
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
it
say
knew
or
should
have
known
in
that
case,
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
at
that
time?
that
is
all
you
are
contending
for,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
tort
claims
act
allows
tort
suits
against
the
united
states
and
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
is
waived.
the
act
provides
however
that
the
tort
claim
must
be
presented
within
two
years
after
the
claim
accrues.
this
case
deals
with
when
a
medical
malpractice
tort
claim
accrues
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
it
doesn't
accrue
until
the
plaintiff
knows
not
only
that
he's
been
hurt
in
the
cause
of
the
injury
but
when
he
knows
that
the
injury
causing
conduct
may
constitute
medical
malpractice.
we
think
that
this
holding
represents
the
considerable
departure
from
the
prevailing
law
and
finds
little
if
any
support
in
the
statute
toward
a
legislative
history.
we
hold
that
a
medical
malpractice
tort
claim
accrues
no
later
than
when
the
plaintiff
is
aware
of
his
injury
and
of
its
cause.
and
at
that
time
the
two
year
statute
begins
to
run
and
within
that
time
he
must
decide
whether
to
file
suit
or
not
in
just
the
same
way
that
other
tort
claimants
must
make
up
their
mind.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
with
the
third
circuit
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
