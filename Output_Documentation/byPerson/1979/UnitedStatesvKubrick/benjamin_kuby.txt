mr.
benjamin
kuby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
commence
my
brief
remarks
against
a
background
of
the
congressional
history
found
in
the
1949
amendments
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
where
congress
said
it
is
not
the
intention
of
the
federal
government
to
deprive
tort
claimants
of
their
day
in
court
or
of
their
remedies;
nor
on
the
other
hand
does
it
propose
to
incur
a
delay
in
the
enforcement
of
plaintiff
rights
or
to
harass
the
government
by
increasing
difficulty
of
securing
evidence.
against
this
backdrop
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
they
changed
the
statute
of
limitations,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
at
that
time
to
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
but
kept
the
word
"accrual."
mr.
benjamin
kuby
as
it
was.
and
we
are
here
basically
to
define
the
term
"accrual."
i
think
in
connection
with
that
that
is
important
to
note
the
factual
basis
--
and
i
may
elaborate
a
little
bit
on
what
the
government's
counsel
has
said.
this
is
not
a
simple
case.
this
was
a
situation
where
this
korean
veteran,
with
an
osteomyelitis
condition
in
his
right
femur,
was
fed
for
13
days
neomycin
sulfate,
a
one
percent
solution.
he
had
never
heard
of
this
drug
before.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
it
was
fed
in
such
a
way
through
tubes,
through
a
suction
apparatus
with
the
matter
being
--
bottles
being
constantly
changed,
until
he
left
the
hospital.
that
is
all
he
knew
about
it.
he
goes
home.
he
then
proceeds
to
have
in
the
months
to
come
a
reduction
in
his
hearing.
he
in
fact
goes
back
to
the
veterans
hospital
in
wilkes-barre
and
they
finally
do
oreometric
tests
on
him
in
june
of
1978.
while
he
was
in
the
hospital
they
did
nothing.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
he
was
not
hard
of
hearing
in
the
hospital
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
i
would
submit
--
and
there
is
no
question
about
malpractice
here,
there
is
no
question
about
negligence,
goes
to
the
issue
of
what
they
were
doing
for
him
and
what
he
trusted
them
with.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
unfortunately,
in
the
negligence
aspects
of
the
case,
it
became
abundantly
clear
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
him
audio
metric
tests
when
you
are
feeding
someone
neomycin
which
has
ototoxic
effects
as
well
as
neurotoxic
effects.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
in
this
situation,
it
took
a
number
of
months
before
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
--
it
started
to
develop.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
in
the
portis
case,
another
case
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
it
took
years
to
develop
with
the
same
drug.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
for
instance
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
yes.
this
is
not
the
type
of
case
such
as
the
classic
basis
for
the
courts
of
this
country
utilizing
the
discovery
doctrine,
and
that
was
the
classic
case
of
a
surgeon
leaving
a
sponge
in
someone's
stomach
or
a
clip
in
someone's
stomach,
that
he
does
not
become
aware
of
the
injury
until
he
is
opened
up.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
well,
that
was
not,
if
i
may
submit,
a
malpractice
case.
that
was
an
fela
case
where
the
standards
were
different,
where
in
this
situation,
i
would
submit,
that
knowing
that
he
has
had
a
loss
of
hearing
develop
in
a
situation
where
a
doctor
has
told
him
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
came
from
neomycin
does
not
set
him
off
in
searching
--
does
not
set
off
this
man
and,
as
the
court
found
below,
would
not
have
set
off
a
reasonable
man
both
in
an
objective
and
subjective
test
in
going
further
when
the
united
states
government
through
the
veterans
administration
kept
saying,
one,
there
is
no
causation
because
our
doctors
say
when
you
get
neomycin
topically
through
an
irrigation
process
it
doesn't
produce
these
toxic
effects,
it
is
only
when
you
get
it
peremptorily
--
and
i
am
sure
he
didn't
know
what
the
word
"peremptorily"
meant
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that
is
the
typical
example
of
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
systemically
pumped
into
the
blood
stream.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
they
were
running
it
in
and
out
of
his
system.
now,
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
show
and
what
the
courts
below
and
the
courts
in
most
of
the
circuits
have
said,
that
in
situations
where
you
have
a
man
such
as
kubrick
who
has
less
than
a
high
school
education,
that
you
look
at
those
things
and
you
are
determining
whether
or
not
he
utilized
reasonable
diligence,
and
that
is
the
standard
as
to
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
when
by
the
reason
of
discovery
or
by
reasonable
diligence
he
should
have
discovered
all
the
aspects
of
his
claim.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
because
of
the
complexity
of
this
drug
treatment,
we
submit
that
he
should
not
have
suspected
negligence
until
dr.
soma
told
him
that
it
was
negligent
for
the
government
to
have
given
it
to
him,
and
that
was
in
june
of
1971,
and
it
was
only
as
a
result
of
the
government
saying
wait
a
second,
it
wasn't
what
you
have
been
saying
for
the
last
two
years
which
has
caused
your
deafness,
it
is
something
entirely
different
because
you
worked
for
rca
up
in
the
wilkes-barre
area
and
were
subjected
to
this
noise.
he
says,
no,
that
is
not
true.
he
had
letters
from
all
of
his
prior
workers
which
are
in
the
court
record
which
say
he
had
perfect
hearing
before
and
it
was
then
that
the
government
was
in
effect
misleading
him.
but
let
me
also
say
this,
that
the
government
not
only
reversed
itself
on
the
issue
of
causation,
but
reversed
itself
on
the
issue
of
malpractice
in
1965.
and
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
government
counsel
because
the
va
regulations
provide
that
you
don't
get
benefits
under
section
351
unless
in
addition
to
showing
causation
you
show
that
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
negligence
or
medical
error,
and
every
time
they
said
no
causation
they
said
no
negligence,
no
medical
error,
and
in
his
testimony
he
said
i
never
believed
that
they
were
guilty
of
medical
error,
all
i
knew
was
that
as
a
veteran
it
is
like
a
service-connected
disability,
if
i
go
into
a
veterans'
hospital
i
am
entitled
as
long
as
their
is
causation
to
get
a
pension,
to
get
an
increase
on
my
pension.
he
never
believed
that
there
was
malpractice
and
he
so
said
in
the
record.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
it
is
a
fact
that
the
trial
court
who
takes
the
evidence
--
which
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
must
be
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
test
--
in
making
this
determination
as
to
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
must
be
balanced,
it
must
be
balanced
with
what
was
the
harm
to
the
government.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
but
if
the
legislative
history
says
on
the
one
hand
we
want
to
have
--
we
want
to
give
the
people
of
this
country
their
day
in
court,
but
we
also
have
to
balance
it,
that
was
part
of
the
legislative
history.
and
in
this
case
there
was
absolutely
no
prejudice
whatsoever
because
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
no.
i
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
a
person
who
is
one
year
from
date
of
accrual
--
that
was
two
years
from
date
of
accrual,
and
that
was
to
be
interpreted
by
this
court,
that
is
the
duty
of
this
court,
to
interpret
what
the
legal
word
means,
accrual.
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
the
most
recent
case
of
steel
v.
united
states,
which
was
published
subsequent
to
the
printing
of
our
brief,
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
federal
tort
claims
act
differentiated
between
a
medical
malpractice
case
and
a
case
based
upon
an
electrical
injury
as
a
result
of
failure
to
properly
wire
parts
of
an
airport,
made
reference
as
they
made
this
distinction,
because
they
put
medical
malpractice
cases
in
a
separate
area,
made
reference
to
the
regulations
of
the
defense
department
of
this
country
which
provide
under
the
regulations
concerning
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
dealing
with
accrual,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
it
says
"except
in
medical
malpractice
cases,
a
claim
accrues
on
the
date
on
which
the
alleged
wrongful
act
or
omission
results
in
some
actionable
injury
or
damage
to
the
claimant.
in
medical
malpractice
cases,
accrual
is
postponed
until
such
time
as
the
claimant
reasonably
discovers
or
reasonably
should
have
discovered
the
act
or
omissions
which
are
alleged
to
be
wrongful.
now,
that
is
what
the
federal
government
says
for
the
department
of
the
army
in
its
regulations
at
the
present
time.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
their
position
in
this
case
is
that
--
if
i
might
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
if
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
stevens
--
is
that
the
mere
knowledge
of
the
happening,
not
the
wrongful
acts
--
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that
separates
us,
but
i
think
that
the
reading
of
this
regulation,
as
the
seventh
circuit
makes
note
of
it,
because
it
also
cites
a
regulation
from
the
airports
which
talks
about
the
hungerford
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
says
these
two
departments
of
the
united
states
government
aren't
talking
about
the
same
thing.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
the
caption
is
599
f.
2d
823,
decided
june
12,
1979.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
this
was
the
opinion
by
harlington
wood,
jr.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that
is
dewitt.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that
is
dewitt
which
we
have
included
in
our
brief,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
i
think
it
was
judge
tuttle.
it
was
wisdom,
i'm
correct,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
yes.
in
this
case,
however,
in
dealing
with
the
situation,
he
says
he
put
medical
malpractice
cases
in
a
separate
category.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that's
right.
the
only
fight
is
what
has
to
be
included
in
the
doctrine
of
accrual,
is
it
reasonable
in
language
without
the
medical
knowledge
to
start
the
wheels
rolling,
or
is
it
reasonable
and
should
it
be
for
the
district
court
judge,
based
upon
all
the
circumstances,
to
make
that
finding
which
is
done
here
and
under
the
cases
of
this
court
if
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
it
is
rarely
if
ever
explored
by
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
the
ashley
case
again
took
up
the
position
from
just
knowing
injury.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
i
am
submitting,
sir,
that
the
eight
and
ninth
circuit
both
adopted
this
limited
discovery
rule
that
whoever
the
party
may
be,
it
might
be
layman
with
a
fifth
grade
education,
a
lawyer
with
so
many
years
of
education,
it
starts
to
run
when
he
knows
of
that
injury.
all
the
other
circuits
--
not
as
to
the
causation.
all
the
other
circuits
say
that
is
not
enough
to
open
up
and
to
give
knowledge
to
the
layman
who
is
injured.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
the
sanders
case,
decided
by
the
district
court
here
in
washington,
said
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
nurse,
yes,
she
has
special
knowledge
and
we
take
that
into
account
and
we
say
that
when
she
knew
about
her
injury
because
of
that
factor,
it
became
known
to
her
or
should
have
been
known
to
her.
so
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
if
it
were
a
laryngologist,
of
course.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
i
think
the
courts
have
used
the
standard,
those
who
have
enunciated
it
of
both
the
reasonable
man,
the
objective
standard
and
the
subjective
standard
of
the
person
involved,
a
person
such
as
mr.
kubrick
who
trusted
his
government.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
you
might
have
a
different
result
based
upon
the
knowledge
acquired
by
the
trial
judge
in
assessing
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
as
the
courts
have
said,
these
are
to
be
dealt
with
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
accrual
is
to
be
dealt
with
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
based
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
benjamin
kuby
that
is
the
test,
mr.
justice,
that
we
espouse,
that
for
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
dealing
with
the
government,
that
the
basis
should
be
as
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit.
now,
that
is
the
outward
parameter.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
many
situations
where
the
court
will
not
deal
with
that
but
will
on
the
basis
of
the
knowledge
of
who
the
injured
party
was,
the
circumstances,
what
he
knew,
then
on
certain
subjects
it
will
be
the
knowledge
of
the
injured,
the
causation.
i
would
feel
that
the
government
rested
a
great
trust
in
mr.
kubrick.
i
would
only
close
by
saying
from
a
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case
decided
over
a
hundred
years
ago,
in
menges
v.
depper,
where
men
naturally
trust
in
their
government
and
they
ought
to
do
so,
and
they
ought
not
to
suffer
more.
thank
you.
