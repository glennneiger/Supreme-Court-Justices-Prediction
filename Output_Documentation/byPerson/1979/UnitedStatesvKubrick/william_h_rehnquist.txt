rehnquist
how
many
courts
of
appeal
are
against
you
on
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
but
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
is
with
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
you
are
just
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
reasonably
believed
it
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
as
long
as
he
knew
that
he
was
injured
and
causation,
that
is
enough.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
he
reasonably
believed
it
was
malpractice
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
change
the
statute
of
limitations
at
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
it
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
both
of
those
cases,
they
are
not
unlike
urie
v.
thompson
with
the
gradual
development
of
silicosis
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
gradual
onset,
the
long
period
of
time
in
which
it
takes
to
develop
the
condition
for
which
remedy
is
sought.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
urie
the
court
said
in
what
seems
to
me
quite
a
similar
case
that
the
inflicted
employee
can
be
held
to
be
injured
only
when
the
accumulated
effect
of
the
deleterious
substance
manifests
themselves.
that
sounds
to
me
like
he
has
to
know
that
something
is
wrong
with
him
and
not
necessarily
when
it
began
to
happen
but
that
he
need
not
know
that
it
was
a
result
of
any
particular
malpractice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
sounds
like
the
equitable
doctrine
of
latches
rather
than
the
statute
of
limitations
which
has
been
imposed
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
legislative
history
intended
to
amend
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
substitute
a
doctrine
of
latches
for
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
which
it
virtually
enacted?
