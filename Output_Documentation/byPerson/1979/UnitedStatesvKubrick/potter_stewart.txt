stewart
and
the
cause
you
would
concede?
justice
potter
stewart
not
whether
or
not
there
was
negligence
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
art
or
episode
was
the
causation.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case,
is
there,
of
concealment,
fraudulent
concealment
or
any
other
kind
of
concealment?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
claim
of
concealment
or
fraudulent
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
hiding
anything
from
him.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
claim
was
not
and
did
not
have
to
be
based
on
any
negligence,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
had
happened.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
the
same
as
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
wasn't
hard
of
hearing
in
the
hospital,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
wasn't
to
be
sure.
my
question
was
addressed
only
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
your
argument.
you
said
he
went
back
for
audio
metric
tests
which
i
suppose
are
hearing
tests
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
while
he
had
previously
been
in
the
hospital
they
had
done
nothing
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
that
there
was
no
need
to
give
him
audio
metric
tests
while
he
had
previously
been
in
the
hospital
because
he
wasn't
hard
of
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
either
one
of
those
words,
but
how
long
does
it
take
you
to
become
hard
of
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
citation
of
that
case
or
the
date
of
it
--
it
is
the
seventh
circuit,
and
what
is
the
caption
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
823.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
may
not
have
heard
it
correctly,
but
as
i
understood
that
regulation,
it
was
that
the
potential
plaintiff
has
to
discover
the
wrongful
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
alleged
to
be
wrongful.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wondering
if
he
had
to
have
knowledge
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
acts.
