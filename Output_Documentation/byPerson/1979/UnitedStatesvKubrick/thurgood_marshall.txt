justice
thurgood
marshall
--
this
ringing
in
the
ears,
is
that
when
it
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
when
he
knew?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
diagnosis
was
by
the
same
people
he
has
got
this
case
against.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
had
been
to
the
va
hospital,
too,
hadn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
had
this
running
letter
business
going.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
mean
an
average
person
would
say
that
because
i
am
getting
older
and
i
am
getting
deafer,
so
therefore
neomycin
is
the
cause
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
possible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
did
the
va
say,
that
it
had
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
well,
shouldn't
he
trust
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
record
show
that
he
knew
he
was
given
this
neomycin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
affirmatively?
i
don't
need
the
citation,
but
i
didn't
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
when
it
was
given
to
him,
did
he
know
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
could
he
--
he
couldn't
have
assumed
it
until
somebody
told
him,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
helped
him
out;
will
you
help
me
out?
what
do
you
mean
by
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
was
the
other
side,
i
should
have
asked
them,
but
when
at
this
stage
should
he
have
suspected
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
this
man
find
out
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
was
given
this
drug
in
the
wrong
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
basis
of
--
what
put
him
on
notice
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
best
thing
to
do
from
now
on
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
is
to
sue
the
day
you
come
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
should
investigate
the
possibility
--
you
assume
that
the
medical
authorities
of
the
united
states
government
are
negligent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
think
anybody
should.
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
what
the
respondent
says,
he
trusted
them.
