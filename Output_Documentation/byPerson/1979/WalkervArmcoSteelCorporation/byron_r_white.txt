justice
byron
r.
white
you
come
not
to
praise
ragan,
but
to
bury
it,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
a
civil
action
is
commenced,
but
what
makes
--
why
is
that
--
would
that
necessarily
--
what
if
a
state
law
said
just
specifically
that,
and
by
the
way,
we
mean
what
we
say,
just
the
starting
of
an
action
does
not
satisfy
our
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
some
other
event
that
happened
before
the
statute
of
limitations
is
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
answer
to
brother
rehnquist's
question
whether
or
not
you
agree
or
don't
agree,
that
is
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
under
erie
railroad
against
tompkins,
federal
courts
and
diversity
actions
are
required
to
apply
state
substantive
law.
it
is
equally
well-settled
that,
as
a
matter
of
procedure,
and
everybody
agrees
that
it
is
a
matter
of
procedure,
then
there
is
a
uniform
federal
law
applied
in
diversity
cases,
in
federal
courts
as
well
as
all
other
cases
in
federal
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
that's
good
or
bad
or
philosophically
supportable
or
not,
you
don't
need
to
say.
it
is
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
state
court,
in
other
words,
there
is
a
responsibility
of
the
plaintiff
and
his
counsel
to
cause
the
marshal
to
be
delivered
--
to
cause
the
summons
to
be
delivered
to
the
marshal?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
probably
better
get
another
lawyer
if
he
does
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
just
waiving
a
perfectly
good
defense,
but
that
is
hardly
a
legal
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
galt,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
oklahoma
practice,
because
i
have
been
a
little
confused.
i
thought
i
heard
some
argument
to
the
effect
that
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law,
this
action
was
commenced,
but
then
there
just
wasn't
service
within
60
days.
that's
not
right,
is
it?
the
action
was
not
commenced,
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law,
as
i
read
the
statute.
it
says
it
is
commenced
at
the
time
the
summons
is
served
on
him;
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
commenced
at
that
time
if
service
was
made
within
60
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
oklahoma
statute
says,
"shall
be
deemed
commenced
upon
service
of
summons",
as
i
read
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
way
it's
construed
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
taylor
case
a
--
i
don't
recall
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
step
is
required
for
what
to
have
occurred,
for
the
action
to
have
been
commenced?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
page
3
of
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit,
in
the
petition
for
writ
certiorari?
i
think
it
is
probably
a-3,
where
it
cites
oklahoma
statute
annotated
title
12,
section
97,
"an
action
shall
be
deemed
commenced
within
the
meaning
of
this
article",
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
"intent
to
commence
an
action";
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
since
we
don't
have
the
statute
of
limitations
before
us,
assume
for
a
moment
it
provides
that
it
runs
until
--
i
mean,
an
action
must
be
commenced,
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
time,
if
ever,
when
the
action
against
your
client
was
commenced?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
your
view
is
that
the
action
is
commenced
upon
the
date
of
service.
if
that
is
true,
i
fail
to
see
any
relevance
whatsoever
to
the
60-day
provision
in
the
oklahoma
statute.
it
is
either
commenced
when
the
complaint
is
filed,
which
the
federal
rule
provides,
and
you
disagree
with
it
--
so
does
ragan
--
or,
alternatively,
it
is
commenced
upon
service,
or
attempt
to
make
service.
you
say
it
is
the
latter
and
your
opponent
says
it's
the
former.
so
why
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
60-day
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
that
means
is
that
your
statute
of
limitations,
instead
of
being
24
months
long
is
26
months
long,
but
you
have
still
got
to
commence
the
action
within
the
26
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
commenced
for
your
purposes
being
served.
that
is
what
you
are
arguing.
