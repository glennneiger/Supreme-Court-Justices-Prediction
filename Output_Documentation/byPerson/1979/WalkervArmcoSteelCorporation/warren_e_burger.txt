chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
this
afternoon
in
fred
n.
walker
against
armco
steel
corporation.
mr.
manners,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
filing
cabinet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
ragan
case
was
decided
somewhat
before
your
lawsuit,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
this
to
any
oklahoma
court,
would
you,
that
you
didn't
like
the
law
the
legislature
had
enacted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand.
ragan
wasn't
overruled.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
uniformity
under
substantive
law
in
diversity
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
say
you
don't
under
the
substantive
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
want
is
the
traditional,
the
erie
rule
under
substantive
law
but
the
federal
law
on
the
procedural.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
second
circuit
think
it
should
be,
or
do
they
think
that's
what
hanna
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
go
back
a
step.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
provisions
of
the
constitution?
that
was
just
giving
what
was
thought
to
be
a
neutral
forum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
does
uniformity
advance
the
idea
of
getting
a
neutral
forum,
one
where
citizens
of
another
state
were
at
least
thought
to
have
a
better
chance
to
get
fair
treatment
in
a
federal
court
than
a
local
court?
how
is
that
advanced,
that
concept
advanced
by
saying
that
the
service
or
process
must
be
uniform?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
but
you
have
told
us
already
that
you
never
got
around
that
far;
you
didn't
get
it
into
the
basket.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
galt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure
he
would
say
--
i
assume
he
would
say
one
of
the
functions
of
the
pleadings
is
to
give
him
notice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
can
assemble
his
evidence
and
get
ready
to
protect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably,
it
might
commence
for
one
purpose
under
the
statute
of
limitations
and
another
purpose
in
terms
of
tolling
your
time,
in
determining
your
time
to
respond.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
matter
of
supplying
this
information,
while
it's
true
we
have
the
statutes
available,
you
are
both
oklahoma
lawyers,
you
submit
whatever
you
wish
to
submit
on
it
as
promptly
as
possible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
perhaps
can
do
that
before
you
leave
the
building.
