justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
only
nine
of
us
up
here
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
thought
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
principle
you
want
us
to
adopt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
are
those?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
federal
rules
had
no
provision
which
was
a
counterpart
to
oklahoma's
provision
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
there
must
be
an
affirmative
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
covering
this
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
urge
us
to
go
back
to
swift
against
tyson,
or
the
days
of
the
federal
common
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
federal
rule
3
say
"told"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
there
in
the
rule
though
that
says
that
the
beginning
of
an
action
is
just
the
filing
of
the
complaint
satisfies
the
state's
statute
of
limitations?
i
mean,
it
may
start
the
action,
but
does
it
say
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
virtue
of
uniformity,
as
you
put
it,
on
the
procedural
side
when
basically
you
are
dealing
with
practitioners
in
oklahoma
city
or
tulsa
who
practice
in
both
the
federal
and
state
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
virtue
of
uniformity
on
the
procedural
side
if
you're
not
going
to
have
it
on
the
substantive
side?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
the
same
justification
that
justice
storey
advanced
for
swift
against
tyson
in
1842,
that
the
law
does
not
lay
down
one
rule
in
athens
and
another
rule
in
rome;
that
the
law
should
be
uniform
throughout
the
federal
court
system
substantively.
you
don't
agree
with
that,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case?
you've
got
two
years
and
60
days.
and
you
have
got
two
years
and
60
days
to
file
the
complaint,
rather
serve
the
complaint.
if
you
don't
serve
it,
you're
out.
whether
or
not
you
have
commenced
the
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
we
--
how
is
a
federal
matter,
when
you
say
that
for
state
law
purposes,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
the
state
is
incompetent
to
require
another
step.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
you
know,
counsel,
is
there
any
provision
in
the
federal
rules
that
sets
a
time
limit
on
actual
service
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
once
the
complaint
is
filed?
suppose
this
complaint
or
summons
hadn't
been
filed
for
six
years
after
the
complaint
had
been
filed
in
court,
would
the
federal
rules
have
nonetheless
have
held
it
to
be
a
good
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
he
ever
know
there
was
a
case
if
he
hadn't
been
served?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
statute
of
limitations
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
say
rule
3
doesn't
say
that
commencing
an
action
stops
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
means
that
after
that
time,
if
it
was
filed
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
no
more
applicability.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure,
the
question
certainly
wasn't
too
clear.
what
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
commencing
of
the
action
doesn't
put
the
statute
of
limitations
out
of
the
picture
under
rule
3,
even
though
the
action
was
commenced
within
the
appropriate
statutory
period?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
section
is
section
95,
two
sections
ahead
of
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
