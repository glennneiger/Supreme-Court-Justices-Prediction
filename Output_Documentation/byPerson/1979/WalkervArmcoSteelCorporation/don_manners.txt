mr.
don
manners
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
honorable
court.
fred
walker
was
a
carpenter,
and
on
august
22,
1975,
he
was
driving
an
armco
nail
into
a
piece
of
wood
and
it
shattered,
putting
out
his
eye.
he
came
to
my
firm
and
eventually
we
filed
a
suit
on
august
19,
1977,
within
the
two-year
statute
of
limitation
in
the
federal
court.
and
the
summons
were,
what
shall
we
say,
lost?
we
thought
the
marshal
had
them
and
the
marshal
thought
the
clerk
had
them.
and
we
did
a
file
review
some
90
days
later
and
we
found
them
in
our
filing
cabinet.
we
took
them
down
there.
i
want
to
be
square
with
you.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
i
can't
find
who
--
no
one
will
admit
in
the
firm
ever
bringing
them
back
but,
anyway,
we
found
them
in
an
unmarked
folder
in
the
filing
cabinet
on
a
file
review.
that's
how
we
found
out
they
didn't
get
to
the
marshal.
in
any
event,
the
summons
are
taken
to
the
marshal
and
armco
is
served
some
104
days
later.
now,
oklahoma
has
a
statute
that
they
must
be
served
within
60
days
beyond
the
statute
of
limitation,
part
of
their
statute.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
procedural
or
substantive,
i
guess.
and,
of
course,
under
rule
3,
you
don't
have
that
problem.
anyway,
service
was
had
and
then
the
ragan
case
came
like
a
falcon
out
of
the
skies
and
struck
down
our
lawsuit,
and
here
we
are.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
the
hanna
case
is
a
group
barn
burner
on
our
side,
but
it
didn't
overrule
ragan.
mr.
don
manners
anyway,
judge
doyle
of
the
tenth
circuit,
when
he
wrote
his
opinion,
the
last
paragraph
states,
"the
supreme
court
would
perform
a
great
service
if
it
were
to
clear
away
the
dilemma
which
exists
as
a
result
of
the
conflict
between
ragan
and
hanna."
he
says,
"we
recognize
that
decisions
are
frequently
allowed
to
die
on
the
vine,
so
to
speak.
we
also
recognize
under
such
instances
death
does
not,
as
a
practical
matter,
take
place.
if,
however,
ragan
was
intended
to
die
a
natural
death,
it
failed
to
happen."
so
what
we
are
here
--
i
am
attempting
to
persuade--
mr.
don
manners
i
come
to
bury
ragan,
if
possible.
now,
chief
justice
warren
in
the
hanna
case
wrote
a
spectacular
decision,
well-reasoned,
well
thought
out.
and
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
--
mr.
don
manners
and
carefully
saved
ragan.
mr.
don
manners
well
thought
out;
carefully
saved
ragan.
but
justice
harlan
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
he
thought
ragan
was
wrong.
and
you
know,
going
back
at
the
beginning,
under
28
--
section
2072,
when
they
enacted
the
rules,
the
federal
rules,
it
said,
"all
laws
in
conflict
with
such
rules
should
be
a
little
further
force
or
effect
unless,
of
course,
they
invade
the
substantive
portion."
so,
really
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
rules
of
commencement
of
an
action
in
service
are
procedural
or
substantive.
you
know,
i
am
from
oklahoma
and
i
don't
like
to
say
this.
basically
speaking,
we've
got
an
awful
good
state
there,
but
i'm
not
much
in
favor
of
a
service
statute
where
your
defendant
can
hide
out
for
61
days
and
you've
lost
your
case.
if
you
can't
find
him
in
61
days
or
prove
he's
out
of
the
state,
you're
just
dead
in
the
water
down
there.
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
that
the
federal
rules
for
the
courts
of
all
the
federal
courts
here,
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
that
the
60-day--
mr.
don
manners
we've
got
more
brush
down
there
in
our
country
for
them
to
hide
in.
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
run
afoul
of
the
60-day
deal.
sometimes
you
just
can't
find
them,
and
you're
dead.
but
in
this
case
i
feel
particularly
bad
because
mr.
walker
had
an
injury
and
somehow
or
other,
like
something
dropping
from
the
skies,
i
find
the
summons
in
the
filing
cabinet
back
in
the
office
on
a
file
review.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir,
because
oklahoma
courts
are
not
covered
by
rule
3.
mr.
don
manners
a
federal
question,
right.
mr.
don
manners
i
want
you
to
adopt
the
principles
elucidated
in
hanna.
mr.
don
manners
those
are
for
uniformity,
the
federal
rules
should
govern
service.
this
case
turns
on
rule
4
1(d),
which
is
where
the
statute
requires
that
you
thrust
it
directly
in
the
hand
of
an
executor
and
they
left
it
with
his
wife.
and
the
court
held
that
under
the
federal
rules,
the
rule
having
to
do
with
service
would
apply.
mr.
don
manners
what
would
i
do?
i
would
be
defending
a
case
of
malpractice;
that's
what
i
would
be
doing,
probably.
mr.
don
manners
without
federal
rule
3
and
federal
rule
4,
i
have
no
standing.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir.
the
federal
rules
set
up
for
the
maintenance
and
the
handling
of
federal
cases
in
this
country,
i
think
should
be
controlling
of
cases
filed
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
i
am
embarrassed,
and
i
should
be
that
this
matter
happened
at
my
law
firm.
but
i
think
under
the
pure
question
of
law
that
fred
walker
is
entitled
to
relief.
i
think
that
the
federal
rules,
rule
3
should
govern
what
commences
an
action.
the
federal
rule
states
it
very
succinctly.
it
says,
it's
told
when
the
case
is
filed,
under
federal
rule
3.
now,
your
rule
4
--
mr.
don
manners
let
me
get
it
exactly,
your
honor.
rule
3,
"a
civil
action
is
commenced
by
filing
a
complaint
with
the
court."
that
is
what
it
says
specifically.
rule
4
puts
the
burden
upon
the
clerk.
it
says,
"upon
filing
of
a
complaint,
the
clerk
shall
forthwith
issue
a
summons
and
deliver
it
for
service
to
the
marshal
or
persons
specially
appointed
to
serve
it.
mr.
don
manners
it
says,
"a
civil
action
is
commenced
by
filing
a
complaint
with
the
court."
mr.
don
manners
your
honor
--
mr.
don
manners
oklahoma
state
law
does
provide
that
an
action
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
the
petition,
but
it
has
an
additional
statute,
two
sections
down,
that
says
if
you
can't
get
service
with
due
diligence
within
60
days
that
you're
just
through.
mr.
don
manners
excuse
me,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
state
from
having
that
law.
my
position
is
that
under
the
federal
rules,
fred
walker
is
entitled
to
the
federal
rule
law,
under
hanna,
which
goes
into
erie.
i
am
sure
everybody
is
familiar
--
i
think
you
were
on
the
court
when
hanna
was
decided.
mr.
don
manners
no,
but
a
lot
of
people
thought
it
was.
i've
got
a
beautiful
second
circuit
opinion
here.
mr.
don
manners
and
judge
doyle
says
he
prefers
the
federal
rules.
really,
we're
talking
about
making
uniformity.
every
citizen
--
mr.
don
manners
i
don't
believe
that
it's
substantive,
your
honor.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
manners
well,
it
would
make
it
a
lot
easier
on
the
circuit
courts,
for
one
thing,
because
they
would
not
have
the
higgledy-piggledly
mess
of
each
state
having
a
different
set
of
semi
or
quasi
substantive
or
procedural
law.
procedural
or
substantive
is
a
difficult
question
at
best.
but,
if
you
file
a
case
in
court,
you
ought
to
go
by
that
court's
procedures.
what
commences
an
action,
how
service
is
made--
mr.
don
manners
well,
rule
4
did
in
the
hanna
case.
mr.
don
manners
your
honor,
they
served
the
executor
by
leaving
it
with
his
wife.
the
state
statute
provides
that
you
had
to
serve
the
executor
in
hand.
and
they
held
that
the
federal
rules
of
service
circumvented
the
state
rule
required
that
the
executor
be
served
in
hand.
there
is
very
little
difference
between
that
and
the
rule
3,
of
following
the
federal
rules
so
far
as
filing
the
case
commencing
it
and
the
service
being
sent
out
by
the
clerk
to
the
marshal
and
served.
rule
4
gives
the
clerk
the
duty--
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir,
i
am
saying
if
you
extend
the
hanna
rule
to
cover
rule
3,
like
the
second
circuit
thinks
it
should
be--
mr.
don
manners
they
think
that
hanna
overruled
ragan.
mr.
don
manners
well,
i
guess
the
virtue
would
be
that
under
the
federal
rules
and
under
the
federal
system
to
make
them
the
same.
each
citizen
and
each
state
would
have
the
same
rights
under
the
federal
law.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
that's
the
way
life
is.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
sir,
i
do
feel
very
strongly
that
service
of
summons
and
the
rules
about
commencing
an
action
are
procedural.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir,
it
says
commenced
upon
filing
a
complaint,
but
you
must
obtain
service
within
60
days.
mr.
don
manners
that's
correct.
the
federal
rules
don't
say
that
though.
and
i
think
we
out
to
follow
the
federal
rules
in
this
case.
mr.
don
manners
stop
forum
shopping.
mr.
don
manners
it
would
advance,
each
person
would
know
from
whence
they
hailed
that
the
same
rules
applied
insofar
as
procedure
in
their
courthouse
in
milwaukee
would
apply
so
far
as
procedures
are
concerned
in
the
courthouse
in
oklahoma
city.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
manners
you
go
up
to
the
clerk's
office
and
you
file
it,
and
there
is
a
big
basket
there,
and
they
pitch
it
in
the
big
basket,
and
if
you
don't
want
it
three
or
four
days
getting
to
the
sheriff,
you
say,
"let
me
have
that"
and
you
take
it
back
and
give
it
to
the
deputy.
mr.
don
manners
state.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir.
they
put
it
in
a
basket,
but
if
there
is
a
two
or
three
delay
getting
it
to
the
sheriff,
if
you
want
it
down
to
the
sheriff
that
day,
then
you
ask
them
to
give
it
to
you
and
you
walk
down
and
give
it
to
the
sheriff.
mr.
don
manners
i
thought
we
got
it
into
the
basket.
mr.
don
manners
no,
sir,
i
was
in
federal
court.
mr.
don
manners
rule
4
says
it's
not.
it
says
the
clerk
shall
cause
it
to
be
served,
to
be
given
to
the
marshal.
now,
i
can't
fathom,
and
don't
understand
what
could
have
happened
to
those
summons,
because
the
case
was
filed
and
we
kept
calling
the
clerk
to
ask
if
we
have
got
service,
and
they
would
say
no.
and
then
we
found
them
on
a
file
review.
it's
terrible.
mr.
don
manners
gentlemen,
i
think
i
have
used
a
lot
of
my
time.
and,
if
you'll
tolerate
me
a
second,
i
think
this
is
the
highest
--
the
finest
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
me
in
the
practice
of
law,
being
allowed
to
come
up
here.
a
judge,
named
judge
mills
when
i
was
a
beginning
lawyer
said
you
didn't
have
to
use
all
your
time.
he
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
picture
of
lincoln.
a
little
boy
asked
the
teacher,
said,
"how
long
shall
i
make
lincoln's
legs"?
and
she
said,
"make
them
until
they
touch
the
ground."
so,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
think
my
legs
have
touched
the
ground
here.
