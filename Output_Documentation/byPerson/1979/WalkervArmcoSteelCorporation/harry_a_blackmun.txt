carefully

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
federal
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
there
in
rule
3
to
prevent
the
state
from
having
such
a
provision?
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
a
state
statute
of
limitations
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
the
statute
of
limitations
in
oklahoma
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
will
run
until
a
complaint
is
served?
unless
the
complaint
is
served
within
the
period,
the
case
is
over.
rule
3
wouldn't
prevent
that,
would
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why?
no,
it
didn't.
that
isn't
what
the
court
said
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
weren't
in
state
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
the
federal
court,
it
is
not
your
to
put
it
in
the
basket
as
i
read
the
rules.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
for
forum
shopping
there.
all
he
has
to
do
is
go
in
and
get
the
case
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
we
have
to
presume
people
are
going
to
act
in
their
best
interest,
i
would
assume.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
does
it
help
any,
the
district
court
said
an
action
is
commenced
in
state
court
when
process
issues,
provided
process
is
actually
served
within
60
days.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
the
other
hand,
if
commenced
in
a
federal
lawsuit
means
filing
the
complaint,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
60
days
either.
i
just
don't
see
how
the
60
days
affects
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
galt,
it
is
not
a
question
of
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations;
the
action
would
have
been
commenced
within
the
statutory
period,
if
that
is
an
adequate
commencement
of
the
action.
there
is
no
question
of
tolling.
the
question
is
did
they
commence
the
action
before
the
statute
ran.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
the
issue.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
rule
3
is
perfectly
clear
it
says
it
is
commenced
when
you
file
a
complaint.
but
you
just
say
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understood
in
your
response
to
one
of
the
questions
where
you
said
that
for
purposes
of
filing
an
answer,
you
would
compute
from
the
date
of
service.
that
doesn't
really
answer
the
question
as
to
when
the
action
is
commenced
for
me.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can
see
where,
for
purposes
of
filing
a
responsive
pleading,
that
you
would
compute
from
the
date
of
service,
as
distinguished
from
the
date
of
commencement
of
the
action,
if
it
relates
back
under
oklahoma
practice.
and
somewhere
in
these
briefs
i
have
the
impression,
isn't
there
a
state
court
holding
that
it
does
relate
back?
