mr.
jay
m.
galt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
jay
m.
galt,
from
the
law
firm
of
looney,
nichols,
johnson
&
hayes,
oklahoma
city,
representing
the
respondent
armco
steel
corporation,
an
ohio
corporation.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
much
as
outlined
by
mr.
manners.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
armco
steel
corporation
retains
a
national
service
corporation
as
its
resident
agent
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
whose
office
is
located
within
four
blocks
of
the
federal
courthouse.
and
when
service
was
effected,
101
days
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run,
that
was
the
very
first
notice,
the
first
notice
that
armco
had
received
of
any
claim
by
mr.
walker
against
armco
for
injuries
he
allegedly
sustained
by
reason
of
a
defective
nail.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
took
advantage
of
the
diversity
statute,
and
chose
his
forum
in
the
federal
court.
the
petitioner
admits
that
had
he
filed
this
case
in
the
state
district
court,
and,
in
fact,
it
might
have
been
an
after
thought
that
he
filed
it
in
the
federal
court,
his
initial
pleading
is
denominated
a
petition
rather
than
a
complaint,
and
in
our
state
court
we
would
call
our
initial
pleading
a
petition,
he
chose
the
federal
court
and
has
admitted
that
had
he
filed
this
in
the
state
court,
and
the
same
facts
had
existed,
no
service
for
101
days,
without
question,
his
case
would
have
been
barred
and
dismissed.
but
because
he
was
fortuitous
enough
to
file
it
in
the
federal
court,
we
are
now
before
this
honorable
body
today
asking
and
questioning
whether
or
not
ragan
should
prevail
as
the
rule
covering
this
case.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent,
obviously,
that
ragan
is
good
law
and
that
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
ragan
and
hold
that
hanna
applied,
and
that
the
commencement
of
this
action
by
filing
with
the
clerk
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
don't
think
you
can.
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
asking
that
you
do
is
rule
that
by
filing
under
rule
3,
that
mere
act
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct.
and
we
honestly
don't
agree
with
that.
we
think
that
rule
3
does
not
apply.
state
law
applies,
and
the
state
law
is
very
clear
that
if
you
file
your
action
within
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
period,
from
the
time
that
that
statute
runs,
you
then
have
60
days
to
effect
service.
and
there
is
a
case
taylor
v.
taylor
that
judge
doyle
cites
that
is
out
of
our
court
of
appeals,
that
says
that
the
filing
commences
the
action,
but
there
is
one
step
more
required
to
effect
jurisdiction
of
the
state
district
court,
and
that
is
service
on
the
defendant.
and
it
sets
that
other
step
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
failed
to
take
for
reasons
that
he
has
been
very
honest
with
the
court
about
today.
the
important
thing
that
i
see
in
this
case
is
that
should
this
court
decide
that
rule
3
commences
an
action
to
toll
the
limitations,
what
happens
to
the
diversity
defendant
who
has
the
same
case
filed
in
the
state
court,
the
same
facts
being
present,
no
service
for
101
days,
and
then
mistakenly
that
diversity
defendant
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
diversity
rule
removes
his
case
to
the
federal
court,
files
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
finds
that
it
will
be
overruled.
because
had
he
stayed
in
the
state
court,
his
motion
to
dismiss
would
have
been
sustained
but
because
the
federal
court--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
well,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
think
it
is
because
isn't
the
object
of
erie
and
tompkins
to
avoid
forum
shopping
and
to
avoid
inequitable
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
procedure
in
that
case
would
be
that
had
the
summons
not
been
issued
for
six
years,
we
had
no
similar
statute,
the
defendant
would
most
likely
file
a
motion
under
rule
41
to
have
the
case
dismissed
for
lack
of
diligent
prosecution.
i
believe
that's
the
correct
rule.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
he
would
not
know
that
there
was
a
case
until
at
some
point
in
time,
six
years
later--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
but
he
would
never
have
that
until
he
was
served.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
thought
mr.
justice
rehnquist
questioned
what
if
the
summons
was
not
served
for
six
years.
we
would
not
know,
we
would
not
know
now
that
we
had
been
sued
if
we
had
not
finally
been
given
a
service.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
sure.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that
is
what
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
the
taylor
v.
taylor
case
that
is
cited
in
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
would
indicate
that
oklahoma
would
say
that
it
was
commenced
when
the
petition
was
filed,
or
the
complaint.
but
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes.
really,
what
i
think
taylor
says
is
the
case
is
commenced,
for
the
purpose
of
commencing,
let's
say,
the
word
"commencing"
means
filing,
the
case
was
filed
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
agree
with
what
your
honor
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
the
taylor
case
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
it
is
a
state
case.
it
is
really
a
state
court
of
appeals
case,
but
it
seems
to
say
that
you
file
your
case
and
that
means
commence
with
the
connotation
of
the
word
"file",
and
then
a
second
step
is
required
in
that
plaintiff
must
effect
service
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
within
60
days.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes,
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
the
statute
of
limitations
says
that
there
should
be
two
years
from
the
time
the
injury
occurs
to
file
the
action.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
your
honor,
i
can't
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
our
statute
says
you
have
two
years
for
bringing
personal
injury
action.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
it
has
never
come
up.
we
have
talked
about
12
os
97.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
no.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
no,
no.
i
think
it's
best
that
we
supply
that
to
the
court.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
think
that's
12
os
97.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that
i
can't
answer,
your
honor.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
we
believe
that
ragan
and
hanna,
in
the
vernacular
of
our
diplomatic
corps,
can
peacefully
co-exist.
i
think
that
ragan
looks
to
the
state
law
to
determine
what
it
takes
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
while
hanna
is
a
service
case
dealing
with
what
is
necessary
under
the
federal
rules
to
effect
actual
service
of
process.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
oklahoma
court
has
construed
97
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
actual
statute
that
created
the
plaintiff's
right
in
this
case.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
the
action
against
my
client
was
not
commenced
until
we
were
served
with
summons
some
101
days
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
would
think
for
the
purposes
of
filing
my
answer
that
i
would
calculate
from
the
35th
day.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
because
our
legislature
in
whatever
wisdom
has
said,
"we
are
going
to
give
you
two
years
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
you
must
effect
service
within
60
days
from
that
date."
and
if
you
do
not
effect
service
within
26
months
from
the
date
of
the
injury
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
well,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
mere
filing
of
the
complaint
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
we
are
going
to
have
different
results
obtaining
in
the
state
court
and
a
federal
court.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
suppose
the
question
is
what
does
the
word
"commence"
mean?
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes.
and
rule
3
does
not
say
that
commencement
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
think
that's
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
well
--
mr.
jay
m.
galt
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
in
doing
the
research
and
preparation
for
this
argument,
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
drafters
of
the
rule,
when
they
looked
at
rule
3,
thought
about
putting
a
proviso
in
there
that
filing
the
complaint
would
toll
any
statute
of
limitations
problem.
they
thought
better
of
it
and
did
not
include
that.
some
of
the
writers
have
said
that
the
word
"commencement"
is
in
the
rules
to
have
a
figure
to
calculate
time
from.
the
only
thing
i
can
relate
to
in
answer
to
the
question
is
that
the
oklahoma
statute
says
that
the
action
is
commenced
when
you
are
served
and,
for
my
purposes,
as
a
trial
lawyer,
defense
lawyer,
when
an
action
is
commenced,
it
is
commenced
on
me
when
i
receive
service,
and
that
is
when
i
start
my
preparation
for
a
defense.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
m.
galt
yes,
sir,
we
will.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
for
permitting
me
this
opportunity.
