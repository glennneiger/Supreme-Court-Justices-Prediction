justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
hanna
didn't
say
--
hanna
certainly
didn't
say
that
if
the
state
law
required
service
to
toll
the
statute,
that
just
the
filing
of
the
complaint
will
toll
the
statute
too.
that
isn't
what
hanna
held.
it
didn't
say
that
at
all.
it
said
--
what
you
are
suggesting
to
us
is
that
that
is
what
we
should
hold
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
assume
that
rule
3
does
cover
when
an
action
is
commenced
for
federal
purposes,
and
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
state
can
say
that
will
change
that,
that
if
you
file
the
complaint,
the
action
is
commenced,
the
state
doesn't
argue
with
you
about
that.
your
opponent
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
that.
he
will
just
say,
however,
that
that
just
isn't
enough
to
start
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
state
law
says
you
have
to
do
something
else
to
give
you
60
days.
they
say
our
statute
of
limitations
runs
until
you
are
served
a
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
more
than
that,
mr.
manners?
isn't
there
also
the
point
that
you
do
have
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
are
not
diversity
cases.
and
i
presume
there
is
some
advantage
in
having
the
same
rules
apply
in
federal
trials,
whether
it
raises
a
federal
question
or
a
state
law
question
or
a
mixture
of
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
man
cases
are
a
mixture
of
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
there
another
question
here?
if
your
federal
rules
apply,
as
i
understand
them,
the
duty
to
effect
prompt
service
is
rested
with
the
clerk
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
delivering
the
summons
to
the
marshal.
how
does
the
procedure
work
under
oklahoma
law?
is
it
your
burden
under
oklahoma
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
talking
about
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
somebody
thought
he
was
in
the
state
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
file
the
action
or
commence
the
action?
does
it
say
"file",
or
what
does
it
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
think
that's
rather
important
what
the
statute
of
limitations
requires
to
toll
the
statute.
if
it
required
service
of
process,
i
wouldn't
think
there
would
be
much
of
an
argument.
but
if
it
says
"commencement
of
an
action",
that's
another
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bringing
it?
what
is
the
exact
wording?
i
can't
find
it
anywhere
in
any
of
the
briefs
or
papers
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
wouldn't
it
come
up,
because
that's
the
question.
if
the
state
said
you
only
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
by
painting
the
state
capitol
red,
it
wouldn't
help
you
to
commence
the
action
in
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it
says,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
says
the
statute
runs
until
you
serve
the
complaining,
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we've
got
it
in
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
know
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again,
if
you
had
been
served,
say
35
days
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
you
would
say
the
action
was
commenced
on
that
35th
day;
is
that
right?
