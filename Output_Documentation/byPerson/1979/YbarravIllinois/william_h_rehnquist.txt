justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldberg,
does
your
argument
depend
at
all
on
a
question
of
degree?
i
notice
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said,
"obviously,
this
warrant
to
search
a
department
store
would
not
authorize
the
search
of
everybody
in
a
department
store."
conversely,
suppose
that
a
search
warrant
had
issued
for
explosives
stored
in
a
privately
owned
cabin,
and
police
executing
a
search
warrant
--
say,
the
cabin
dimensions
were
10
by
12
--
at
night.
in
it,
they
found
two
people.
do
you
think
they
would
have
had
the
authority
to
make
a
patdown
search
of
those
two
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
a
line-drawing
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
had
probable
cause,
there
is
no
doubt
they
could
search
them.
what
if
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
challenge
the
validity
of
the
warrant
for
the
search
of
the
premises?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
which
said
that
their
reason
for
searching
it
was
that
it
was
an
open
and
notorious
place
for
exchanging
narcotics.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
say
that
the
searching
officer
could
have
searched,
if
he
could
not
have
searched
the
people
in
the
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
premises?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not
the
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
someone
had
a
market
basket
they
were
wheeling
out
of
the
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
it
has
to
be
almost
a
fixture
in
the
real
property
sense
of
the
word?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
illinois
appellate
division
opinion
on
page
80
of
the
appendix,
it
says,
"in
the
first
patdown
of
the
defendant
at
the
bar,
a
cigarette
package
with
objects
in
it
was
felt
by
the
officer.
within
a
few
minutes
the
officer
again
searched
the
person
of
the
defendant
and
found
six
tinfoil
packs
of
heroin."
now,
let's
pretermit
for
a
moment
your
argument
about
the
first
patdown
being
illegal,
and
assume
that
it
was
legal.
would
you
say
that
the
second
patdown
was
not
legal
under
those
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
the
search
warrant
saying
this
is
a
place
where
heroin
is
frequently
bought
and
sold,
and
that
this
is
a
normal
way
of
carrying
heroin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
say
that
they
patted
down
and
felt
a
cigarette
package
with
cigarettes
in
it.
it
says
with
objects
in
it.
and
these
objects
later
turned
out
to
be
six
tinfoil
packs
of
heroin.
now,
it
doesn't
say
they
were
shaped
like
cigarettes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
test
reasonable
suspicion
or
reasonable
and
actual
suspicion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
the
officer
in
this
case
was
just
dumb.
and
he
had
a
reasonable
and
articulable
suspicion,
but
didn't
know
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
analytically
probable
cause
will
justify
a
search
either
for
weapons
or
for
contraband,
why
won't
reasonable
suspicion
justify
a
patdown,
either
for
weapons
or
contraband--putting
to
one
side
the
terry
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
at
page
80
of
the
appendix
says,
"no
objection
is
made
to
the
warrant
itself."
now
that
leaves
open
all
the
questions
we
have
been
discussing,
but
i
take
it
no
one
challenged
the
validity
of
the
warrant
as,
far
as
it
went?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
transcript
at
page
9,
at
the
bottom
of
it,
where
it
says,
"what
happened
during
the
patdown,
if
anything?"
and
officer
johnson
responds,
"during
the
patdown,
i
felt
some
objects
that
i
felt
to
be
heroin."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
would
at
least
establish
a
subjective
belief
on
his
part.
admittedly
the
test
is
a
subjective
one.
