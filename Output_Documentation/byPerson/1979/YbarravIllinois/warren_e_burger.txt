we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-5937,
ventura
e.
ybarra
against
illinois.
mr.
goldberg,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
independent
of
the
statute,
mr.
goldberg,
if
the
officer
observed
factors
which
would
have
warranted
a
patdown
search
under
a
terry,
what
would
you
say
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
paragraph
4,
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
submission,
the
search
would
--
had
the
search
revealed
the
heroin
the
first
time
around
it
would
be
just
as
unlawful
as
you
contend
with
respect
to
the
second?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
officer
testified
--
since
we
are
getting
into
hypothetical
situations
--
suppose
he
had
testified
that
he
felt
a
package
with
some
objects
in
which
he
thought
might
be
the
little
packages
of
heroin,
but
that
he
decided
to
make
no
issue
of
it
on
the
first
search
to
see
whether
the
subject
would
try
to
pass
the
heroin
on
to
somebody
else
and
then
get
two
customers,
instead
of
one,
on
possession
charges.

mr.
noel
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
reflect
on
that
until
1:00
o'clock.
mr.
noel,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
this
court
hadn't
decided
the
terry
case
as
it
did,
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
under
this
statute
all
of
these
steps
were
appropriate?
you
draw
your
authority
from
the
statute
independent
of
terry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
suggesting
you
can't
rely
on
terry
in
part,
but
primarily
you
are
drawing
on
the
statutory
authority
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
left,
mr.
goldberg,
i
believe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
ybarra
against
illinois
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
