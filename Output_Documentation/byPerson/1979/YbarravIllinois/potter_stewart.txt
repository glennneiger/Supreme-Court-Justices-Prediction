justice
potter
stewart
if
you
were
representing
the
bartender,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
say
that
if
it
was
found
by
a
state
court
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
that
people
in
that
particular
bar
might
well
be
armed,
could
the
patrons
be
patted
down
just
for
weapons,
while
they
made
the
search
--
before
they
made
the
search
of
the
premises?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
weapon?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
if
a
weapon
were
found,
and
assuming
the
possession
of
that
weapon
concealed
on
the
person,
was
a
violation
of
illinois
law,
then
there
could
be
a
general
search.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
a
little
bit
broader
than
that?
i
am
not
saying
it
is
valid.
there
is
talk
here
of
open
and
notorious
narcotics
transactions
in
this
small
place.
so,
it
is
something
more
than
you
just
said.
if
that
is
valid.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
often
true
of
any
bar,
though.
one
gets
off
a
plane
and
there
is
a
bar
and
he
walks
in.
so
i
don't
see
the
significance
of
your
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
this
warrant
authorized
the
search
of
the
premises
and
the
bartender.
supposing
the
search
warrant
had
authorized
a
search
of
everybody
in
the
premises?
then,
i
suppose,
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
supposing,
unlike
the
complaint
here,
this
complaint
had
said
that
there
was
open
notorious
dealing
and
that
persons
in
the
premises
regularly
go
in
and
acquire
some
drugs,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
the
warrant
had
said,
"all
such
persons
may
be
searched
as
well
as
the
bartender
and
the
premises."
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
if
it
were
greg
coming
in
the
door,
a
patdown
would
be
individual?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
noel,
i
am
puzzled
by
your
saying
very
say
he's
just
dressed
in
work
clothes
like
the
other
people
in
the
bar
--
why
would
you
treat
him
any
differently
than
someone
already
in?
he's
just
another
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
are
changing
--
but
if
the
question
is
assumed
someone
is
permitted
to
walk
in,
wouldn't
he
be
fungible
with
the
other
customers,
if
he
just
wore
the
same
kind
of
clothes
and
everything?
i
am
kind
of
surprised
you
said
it
would
be
very
rare
that
you
could
pat
him
down.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
have
about
a
person
in
the
bar,
other
than
the
fact
he
obviously
walked
in?
that's
really
all
you
know
about
him.
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
is
the
person
walking
in
the
door,
as
soon
as
he
gets
across
the
threshold.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
say
any
of
those
things
about
the
people
who
previously
walked
through
the
door.
justice
potter
stewart
but
before
you
made
the
initial
patdown.
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
never
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
point.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
presented?
was
it
ever
raised
in
the
stage
courts
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
illinois
appellate
court
relied
on
the
second
section,
it
implicitly
rejected
the
first
argument.
the
first
section
of
the
statute
talks
about
justifying
it,
to
protect
themselves
from
attack.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
frisk.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
statute
was
called
to
their
attention,
including
both
sections
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
your
frisk
theory
is
valid,
you
would
also
entitled
to
rely
on
subsection
(a),
i
would
think.
if
the
purpose
of
a
frisk
is
to
protect
the
officer
from
attack,
and
subsection
(a)
expressly
says
that
is
a
permissible
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
when
they
didn't
find
any,
that
was
the
end
of
it,
wasn't
it,
under
terry?
and
they
didn't
find
any,
as
you
have
just
told
my
brother
marshall,
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
no
weapon,
nothing
that
he
could
possibly
think
was
a
weapon,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true
about
many
provisions
of
the
constitution,
isn't
it,
including
the
fifth
amendment
guarantee
against
compulsory
self-incrimination?
the
most
logical
common-sense
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
the
suspect
about
--
"did
you
do
it?"
and
he
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
say,
"i
won't
answer."
that's
not
very
logical
or
commonsensical,
but
it
is
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
noel,
i
don't
mean
to
keep
going
over
the
same
point,
but
your
case
really
depends
almost
entirely
on
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint
for
a
search
warrant.
that's
the
entire
basis
of
your
claim,
that
there
was
open
and
notorious
drug
dealing
in
this
particular
location.
if
i
read
it
correctly
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
would
have
it
for
sale,
presumably
to
the
informant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
isn't
a
single
reference
in
here
to
anyone
ever
having
observed
heroin
change
hands
in
that
tavern.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
equally
an
inference
that
the
informant
could
go
in
on
march
1st
and
get
a
packet
from
the
bartender.
justice
potter
stewart
the
informant
had
been
in
the
tavern
on
ten
other
occasions,
but
it
doesn't
say
he
observed
tinfoil
on
each
of
those
occasions.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
for
the
second
district.
an
illinois
statute
authorizes
law
enforcement
officers
to
detain
and
search
any
person
found
on
premises
being
searched
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant,
to
protect
themselves
from
attack
or
to
prevent
the
disposal
or
concealment
of
anything
described
in
the
warrant.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
application
of
this
statute
and
to
the
present
circumstances
violated
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
an
illinois
judge
issued
a
warrant
supported
by
probable
cause
authorizing
the
search
for
illegal
drugs
of
a
place
called
the
"aurora
tap
tavern"
and
also
a
search
of
the
person,
of
the
bartender
of
that
establishment.
in
the
late
afternoon
of
the
same
day
seven
or
eight
officers
proceeded
to
the
tavern.
upon
entering
it,
the
officers
announced
their
purposes
and
advised
all
those
present
that
they
were
going
to
conduct
a
"cursory
search
for
weapons."
one
of
the
officers
then
proceeded
to
pat
down
each
of
the
dozen
or
so
customers
present
in
the
tavern,
while
the
remaining
officers
engaged
in
an
extensive
search
of
the
premises.
the
police
officer
who
frisked
the
patrons
found
the
appellant,
ybarra,
in
front
of
the
bar
standing
by
a
pinball
machine.
in
his
first
patdown
of
ybarra,
the
officer
felt
what
he
described
as
"a
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it.‚Äù
he
did
not
remove
this
pack
from
ybarra's
pocket.
instead,
he
moved
on
and
proceeded
to
pat
down
other
customers.
and
after
completing
this
process
the
officer
returned
to
ybarra
and
frisked
him
once
again.
in
the
second
search
of
ybarra,
the
officer
relocated
and
retrieved
the
cigarette
pack
from
ybarra's
pants
pockets
--
pocket.
inside
the
pack
he
found
six
tinfoil
packets
containing
a
brown
powdery
substance
which
later
turned
out
to
be
heroin.
ybarra
was
subsequently
indicted
by
an
illinois
grand
jury
for
the
unlawful
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
he
filed
a
--
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
all
the
contraband
that
had
been
seized
from
his
person
at
the
aurora
tap
tavern.
at
the
hearing
on
this
motion
the
state
sought
to
justify
the
search
by
reference
to
the
illinois
statute
in
question.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress,
finding
that
the
search
had
been
conducted
under
the
authority
of
the
statute.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
before
the
court
sitting
without
a
jury,
and
ybarra
was
found
guilty.
on
appeal,
the
illinois
appellate
court
held
that
the
illinois
statute
was
not
unconstitutional
"in
its
application
to
the
facts"
of
this
case
--
and
i'm
quoting.
the
court,
therefore
affirmed
ybarra's
conviction
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
denied
his
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
there
followed
an
appeal
to
this
court,
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
when
the
search
warrant
was
issued,
the
authorities
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
found
on
the
premises
of
the
aurora
tap
tavern,
aside
from
the
bartender,
would
be
violating
the
law.
the
complaint
for
search
warrant
did
not
allege
that
the
bar
was
frequented
by
persons
illegally
purchasing
drugs.
it
did
not
state
that
the
informant
had
ever
seen
a
patron
of
the
tavern
purchase
drugs
from
the
bartender
or
from
anybody
else.
nowhere
in
fact,
did
the
complaint
even
mention
the
patrons
of
the
--
of
the
tavern.
not
only
was
probable
cause
to
search
ybarra
absent
at
the
time
the
warrant
was
issued,
it
was
still
absent
when
the
police
executed
the
warrant.
upon
entering
the
tavern,
the
police
did
not
recognize
ybarra
and
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
committed,
was
committing,
or
was
about
to
commit
any
offense
under
federal
or
state
law.
ybarra
made
no
gestures
indicative
of
criminal
conduct,
made
no
movements
that
might
suggest
an
attempt
to
conceal
contraband,
and
said
nothing
of
a
suspicious
nature
to
the
police
officers.
in
short,
the
agents
knew
nothing
in
particular
about
ybarra,
except
that
he
was
present,
along
with
several
other
customers,
in
a
public
tavern
at
a
time
when
the
police
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
bartender
would
have
heroin
for
sale.
it
is
true
that
the
police
possessed
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause
to
search
the
tavern
in
which
ybarra
happened
to
be
at
the
time
the
warrant
was
executed.
but
a
person's
mere
propinquity
to
others
independently
suspected
of
criminal
activity
does
not,
without
more,
give
probable
cause
to
search
that
person.
where
the
standard
is
probable
cause,
a
search
or
seizure
of
a
person
must
be
supported
by
probable
cause
particularized
with
respect
to
that
person.
this
requirement
cannot
be
undercut
or
avoided
by
simply
pointing
to
the
fact
that
coincidentally
there
exists
probable
cause
to
search
or
seize
another
or
to
search
the
premises
where
the
person
may
happen
to
be.
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
protect
the
"legitimate
expectations
of
privacy"
of
persons,
not
places.
each
patron
who
walked
into
the
aurora
tap
tavern
was
clothed
with
constitutional
protection
against
an
unreasonable
search
or
an
unreasonable
seizure.
that
individualized
protection
was
separate
and
distinct
from
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
protection
possessed
by
the
proprietor
of
the
tavern
or
by
the
bartender.
although
the
search
warrant,
issued
upon
probable
cause
gave
the
officers
authority
to
search
the
premises
and
to
search
the
bartender,
it
gave
them
no
authority
whatever
to
invade
the
constitutional
protections
possessed
individually
by
each
of
the
tavern's
customers.
for
these
basic
reasons
amplified
in
considerable
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
the
application
of
the
illinois
statute
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
violated
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
second
district
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
court's
written
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

blackmun
