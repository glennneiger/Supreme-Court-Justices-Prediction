paul
stevens
you
are
talking
about
a
reasonable
suspicion,
or
however
you
verbalize
it,
about
a
weapon,
not
about
narcotics.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rationale
of
this
case,
as
it
comes
to
us
--
the
basis
for
the
decision
was
on
the
statute,
that
if
you
got
a
warrant
to
search
the
premises
you
can
search
people
on
it,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
the
rationale
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
of
weapons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
depending
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
which,
as
i
take
it,
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there
was
a
patdown
or
not?
as
far
as
i
could
see,
the
officer
could
just
have
come
in
and
searched
anybody,
patdown
or
not,
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
certainly
distinguish
the
people
who
were
there
from
the
people
who
arrived
after
the
search
began.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
lot
of
factual
--
has
some
fact-finding
in
it,
hasn't
it?
has
the
fact-finding
been
done
in
the
courts
below?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
--
the
state
never
defended
on
that
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
point
that
is
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
noel,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
whatever
happened
to
greg?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
wasn't
even
present,
was
he?
