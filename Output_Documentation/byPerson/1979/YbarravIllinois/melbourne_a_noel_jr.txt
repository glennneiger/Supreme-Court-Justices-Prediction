mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
melbourne
noel.
i
represent
the
state
of
illinois,
appellee
in
this
particular
matter.
illinois
submits,
your
honors,
that
the
officers
went
to
the
aurora
tap
with
a
valid
search
warrant
for
the
premises
on
march
1st,
properly
followed
the
dictates
of
common
police
sense
in
their
actions
leading
to
a
discovery
of
six
tinfoil
packets
of
heroin
on
ventura
ybarra.
the
state
suggests
that
appellant's
criticism
of
police
action
here
is
contrary
to
common
sense.
indeed,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
crucial
dispute
in
this
case,
between
both
sides,
is
what
amounts
to
a
common-sense
reading
of,
first
of
all,
the
complaint
for
the
search
warrant,
and
then
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
at
the
suppression
hearing.
the
two
sides
really
do
interpret
those
documents
and
testimony
in
very
different
fashions.
we
maintain
that
our
interpretation,
taking
the
inferences
from
the
logical
meaning
of
these
documents,
is
the
correct
one.
illionis
suggest
that
if
the
complete
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
accepted
by
this
court
that
all
drug
enforcement
officers
will
be
less
able
to
lawfully
protect
themselves
from
attack
in
similar
situations,
while
they
follow
orders
to
execute
search
warrants
that
will,
themselves,
be
rendered
more
ineffectual.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
one
of
the
issues
here,
your
honor
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
they
couldn't.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
no.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
is
our
argument
--
and
we
are
agreeing
that
they
should
have
been
patted
down
the
first
time.
and
then
our
argument
is
that
the
first
patdown
of
ventura
ybarra
yielded
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
on
him
the
objects
listed
in
the
search
warrant.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
there
are
circumstances
on
which
a
patdown
for
weapons,
i
think,
could
be
justified
by
a
person
coming
in
the
door.
there
would
have
to
be
more
facts
than
simply
an
individual
coming
in
the
door.
it
depends
who
the
person
was.
you
know,
was
it
a
nun
collecting
for
a
charitable
event,
or
was
it
a
certain
type
of
individual
that
had
other
particular
factors
about
him?
i
say
it
is
possible.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
but
my
point
is,
it
would
depend
on
the
character
of
this
individual
coming
in
the
door.
i
think
there
would
be
a
circumstances
in
which
a
patdown
be
justified
of
a
person
coming
in
the
door.
generally,
i
would
say,
there
would
be
very
few
circumstances
in
which
a
patdown
would
be
justified
of
a
person
coming
in
the
door
during
a
search,
very
few
circumstances.
but
i
think
they
could
be
imagined.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
first
thing,
your
honor,
is
that
in
most
situations
the
man
probably
would
not
be
allowed
to
walk
in
the
door.
i
would
think
probably
there
would
be
policemen
at
the
door
to
explain
to
him
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
perhaps
not
rare,
but
i
think
it
would
require
an
articulation
of
more
than
we
would
articulate
of
the
people
in
the
bar.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
he
is
present
around
the
bar,
and
he
is
on
the
location
where
the
police
officers
are
going
to
be
forced
to
subject
themselves
to
some
risk
in
order
to
carry
out
the
search
warrant.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
all
i
am
trying
to
say
--
maybe
i
misspoke,
your
honor,
in
trying
to
quantify
the
number
of
circumstances
in
which
this
would
have
come
about.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
i
would
hope
that
there
would
be
more
things
that
one
could
say
about
the
person
walking
in
the
door
than
simply
he
walked
in
the
door.
hopefully,
there
would
be
some
additional
factors
about
how
was
he
dressed.
did
he
have
on
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
ventura
ybarra
was
wearing
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
in
the
initial
patdown,
ventura
ybarra
wa
wearing
heavy
clothing
which
was
capable
of
concealing
a
weapon.
he
was
standing
right
next
to
the
bar,
where
the
search
was
going
to
take
place.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
steven's
question,
this
obviously
is
a
difficult
area,
because
three
different
courts
in
illinois
presented
with
this
type
of
fact
situation
have
come
up
with
slightly
different
conclusions
based
on
the
facts
of
their
particular
case.
indeed,
the
same
is
true
of
courts
in
other
states.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
we
do
defend
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
which
did
not
rely
on
a
frisk.
they
didn't
deal
with
that,
as
your
honor
correctly
points
out.
they
relied
on
the
second
section
of
the
statute,
the
reasonable
belief
that
the
people
in
the
aurora
tap
were
involved
with
the
criminal
activity
and
were
likely
to
be
concealing
the
objects
of
the
search
on
their
person.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
up
to
that
point,
yes.
but
the
other
questions
were
related
to
the
frisk.
as
to
the
search
for
the
narcotics
themselves
on
the
persons
of
the
patrons,
we
defend
the
decisions
below
on
that
as
an
alternative
argument.
and
in
doing
so,
we
ask
this
court
to
apply
the
camera-terry
balancing
test
to
allow
this
type
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think
that
--
does
your
honor
refer
to
fact-finding
with
regard
to
the
public
interest
need,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
i
think
that
there
are
enough
opinions
written
on
the
general
subject.
there
is
enough
legislation
written
on
the
subjects
of
drug
control.
and
certainly
this
court
has
written
enough
opinions
on
the
subject
of
the
sacredness
of
the
warrant
and
the
desirability
of
it,
that
i
think
those
interests
don't
need
to
be
developed
any
further,
in
order
to
justify
the
balancing
test
we
are
talking
about.
and
i
think
although
the
appellate
court
opinion
specifically
didn't
invoke
this,
i
think
in
other
illinois
court
opinions
on
the
same
statute
there
is
reference,
the
most
recent
one
being
people
v.
gloria
miller,
which
we
--
it
was
so
recent
we
had
to
include
it
in
our
brief
as
an
appendix.
it
wasn't
published
at
that
time.
in
that
decision,
the
illinois
appellate
court,
first
district,
clearly
employed
the
balancing
test
and
refers
to
this
court's
recent
decision
in
delaware
v.
prouse
and
concludes
that
"a
reasonable
belief
of
the
connection
of
the
individual
to
the
suspected
criminal
activity,
and
a
reasonable
belief
that
he
is
concealing
the
narcotics
on
him"
is
required
before
there
can
be
a
search
under
the
illinois
statute.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
we
don't
rely
so
much
on
the
statute
for
the
frisk,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
feel
that
we
have
to.
if
the
whole
question
of
frisk
goes
out
the
window
here
and
all
we
are
left
with
is
whether
or
not
the
search
for
narcotics
on
the
individual
person
of
ybarra
was
proper,
then
we
rely
on
our
statute,
and
we
rely
on
the
second
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
your
honor,
we
make
two
completely
alternative
arguments.
and
frankly
the
argument
we
prefer
is
the
first
one,
the
argument
involving
proper
frisk
of
ybarra,
which
yields
probable
cause
to
believe,
then,
that
he
has
the
objects
of
the
warrant
on
him.
that's
the
argument
we
prefer.
our
secondary
position
is
the
appellate
court
position
below,
which
relies
on
the
statute.
and
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled
to
make
those
arguments.
as
appellee,
i
believe,
that
we
can
rely
on
any
ground
which
would
support
the
judgment
below.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
sibron
decision
indicated
that
decisions
on
fourth
amendment
questions
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
was
not
directly
presented
to
the
appellate
court.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
was
never
decided
in
so
many
words.
the
trial
judge
indicated
--
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
first
point?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
was
never
decided
specifically.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
was
raised
in
the
testimony
and
presentation
of
the
agent
witness
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
at
the
trial.
it
is
there
in
his
testimony.
it
was
never
argued
by
the
state's
attorney,
either
in
that
court
or
in
the
appellate
court.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
the
state
never
briefed
that
point,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
maintain
that
it
is
inherent
in
the
testimony
of
the
officer.
at
least
four
times,
during
the
trial
court
proceeding,
he
mentioned
that
the
first
search
of
ybarra
was
for
the
purpose
for
discovering
weapons,
to
protect
the
police
officers.
so,
regardless
of
whether
the
illinois
court
saw
the
issue
and
dealt
with
it,
it
was
there.
and,
as
this
court
held
in
sibron,
decisions
of
state
courts
on
fourth
amendment
areas,
based
on
state
law,
are
not
binding
on
this
court.
the
court
said
in
sibron
that
this
court,
in
looking
at
a
situation,
can
determine
independently
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
or
whatever
standard
is
being
used.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
do
that,
and
that's
the
reason
we
make
the
first
argument.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
accurate,
your
honor,
because
they
simply
had
never
been
briefed
on
the
first
point,
on
the
frisk
point,
and
they
simply
didn't
address
it
because
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
the
state's
theory
in
the
appellate
court
was
simply
on
subsection
(b),
search
for
narcotics.
and
the
appellate
court
just
doesn't
usually
address
issues
that
are
not
briefed
specifically
before
it.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
our
only
feeling
is
that
that
subsection
(a)
is
really
superfluous
in
light
of
terry.
we
don't
need
it.
it
wasn't
invoked.
we
don't
feel
any
point
to
arguing
it.
we
rely
on
terry
and
on
this
court's
probable
cause
decisions
following
that.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
they
weren't
presented,
your
honor.
i
wish
they
were.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
the
agent
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
he
felt
was
the
danger
presented
by
the
patrons
in
the
bar
and
why
he
made
the
first
patdown.
the
initial
patdown
of
all
people
in
the
bar
is
clearly
undeniable
only
for
one
reason.
it
is
a
search
for
weapons.
the
reason
why
all
the
patrons
were
searched
before
ybarra
was
searched
the
second
time
was
strictly
because
security
and
protection
was
more
important
than
anything
that
might
have
been
raised
during
the
first
patdown
of
ybarra,
which
regard
to
the
objects
in
the
warrant.
then,
on
top
of
that,
you
have
the
background
of
the
compliant
for
search
warrant,
specifically
setting
out
--
and
we
did
agree
totally
with
opposing
counsel's
interpretation
of
it
--
specifically
setting
out
that
over
a
period
of
days
or
weeks
there
was
open
and
notorious
drug
traffic,
not
usage
or
possession,
but
traffic
of
drugs
in
this
location.
the
informant
went
into
the
tavern,
apparently
as
a
patron,
on
at
least
--
he
said
at
least
ten
other
occasions
he
had
been
there
and
had
observed
tinfoil
packets
on
and
about
the
person
of
the
bartender
greg,
in
a
drawer
behind
the
bar.
and
then
on
this
particular
weekend,
of
february
28-29th,
he
had
seen
no
fewer
than
15
to
25
packets
of
tinfoil
on
or
about
the
person
of
greg.
now,
we
submit
to
you
there
is
no
possible
logical
way
to
read
this,
other
than
that
these
packets,
so
many
packets
of
tinfoil
were
there
because
heroin
was
being
sold
in
this
location.
and
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
any
court--based
on
the
huge
amount
of
jurisprudence
on
this
subject
and
taking
notice
of
the
fact
that
were
you
have
dealing
in
significantly
quantities
of
narcotics
there
is
always
a
danger
of
violence.
there
is
always
the
possibility,
and
indeed
the
likelihood
of
weapons
being
found
on
the
individual
dealers.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
would
agree
that
our
position
would
be
that
both
are
reasonable;
both
are
good
positions,
but
they
would
be
for
different
reasons.
the
patdown
for
weapons
is
based
on
a
different
consideration.
it
is
based
--
the
balancing
test
there
--
we
are
primarily
concerned,
of
course,
with
the
protection
of
the
officers.
the
balancing
test
to
allow
patdown
to
discover
the
narcotics,
based
on
reasonable
suspicion,
would
have
a
different
cast
of
characters.
in
the
balance
there,
you
have
the
interest
not
being
the
protection
of
the
police
officers,
but
there
you
have
the
interest
being
the
great
legislative
stated
purpose
in
checking
the
debilitating
use
of
narcotics
in
this
country,
and
the
judicial
purpose
in
exalting
and
vindicating
the
effectiveness
of
search
warrants.
so,
i
would
say
there
is
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
be
done
for
both
purpose,
but
the
balancing
tests
would
have
different
features
in
each
situation.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
what
is
required,
your
honor,
is
not
a
certainty.
in
fact,
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
in
this
place,
there
were
two
separate
bags
of
marijuana
found,
on
different
people,
i
believe.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
the
only
thing
we
have
is
the
return
from
the
search
warrant,
which
lists
the
items.
and
we
can
presume
that
these
came
from
different
people,
or
they
could
have
all
come
from
the
same
persons.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
your
honor,
we
can
take
reasonable
inferences
from
the
facts.
but,
regardless
of
what
was
found
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
but
that
does
not
determine
whether
or
not
the
officer
was
capable
of
having
a
reasonable
belief
under
terry
before
he
made
the
search.
we
will
admit
that
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
nothing.
and
we
maintain
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
but
the
first
search
of
him,
your
honor,
was
for
weapons.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
feel
that,
rather
than
being
an
extension
or
change
of
terry,
all
that
we
are
asking
here
is
an
explanation
of
the
terry
principle
and
an
application
to
it
--
of
it,
rather
--
to
narcotics
search
warrant
situations,
recognizing
that
general
background
information
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
but
terry
has
been
applied
to
many
other
situations
than
armed
robbery.
in
fact,
the
most
recent
example
which
we
feel
is
even
less
strong
than
our
own
case
is
pennsylvania
v.
mimms.
in
that
situation,
all
you
had
was
a
stop
for
an
individual
having
an
expired
license
plate.
and
he
is
ordered
out
of
the
car
and
a
bugle
appears
under
his
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
a
place
of
business
in
which
there
was
open
and
notorious
narcotics
traffic.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
your
honor,
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
particular
search.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
what
we
find
after
the
frisk
is
made
has
no
bearing
on
whether
or
not
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
before
the
frisk
was
made.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
first
search,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
no,
but
the
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
no.
we
are
not
trying
to
go
backwards
from
the
finding
of
dope
to
justify
either
one
of
the
searches.
so,
our
position
then
on
the
frisk
simply
is,
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
recognize
not
only,
as
terry
did,
that
certain
observed
activities
on
the
part
of
the
suspect
can
lead
to
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
is
armed
and
dangerous.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
interpret
terry
to
allow
general
knowledge
of
narcotics
traffic,
and
general
background
knowledge
contained
in
the
complaint
for
search
warrant
to
provide
the
same
kind
of
basis
for
a
frisk
that
there
was
in
terry.
as
i
was
pointing
out
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
the
only
indication
that
the
police
officer
had
in
going
under
the
coat
of
the
driver
of
the
automobile,
once
he
got
him
out
on
the
side
of
the
road,
was
that
there
was
a
bulge
under
there,
this
individual
had
been
engaged
in
no
felonious
activity
whatsoever.
there
was
no
information
about
him
personally
at
all.
yet
the
simple
fact
that
he
had
been
pulled
over
for
--
an
expired
license,
and
had
a
bulge
under
his
coat,
this
court
found
summarily
was
sufficient
basis
to
justify
the
frisk.
and
we
would
submit
that
in
a
much
more
dangerous
situation
of
police
officers
executing
a
judicially
ordered
search
of
a
place
where
there
had
been
open
and
notorious
drug
traffic,
that
in
that
situation
they
must
be
allowed,
under
these
circumstances,
to
at
least
frisk
--
they
must
be
allowed
to
frisk
at
least
the
people
on
the
premises
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
threat
to
their
safety,
before
they
go
ahead
with
the
search.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
there
is
no
possibility
here
of
a
ploy,
in
order
to
discover
dope,
justice
marshall.
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
agent
johnson,
that
he
--
the
initial
patdown
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
weapons.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
wasn't
the
end
of
it
in
ybarra,
because
in
the
course
of
the
patdown
they
felt
--
agent
johnson
felt
the
cigarette
pack
with
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
but
under
the
lower
court
decisions
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem,
it
is
held
that
if
they
obtain,
in
the
course
of
a
frisk,
reasonable
cause
--
if
they
feel
something
which
gives
them
probable
cause,
rather,
to
believe
that
the
objects
of
a
warrant
are
in
a
pocket,
rather
than
a
weapon,
they
are
allowed
to
operate
on
this.
they
are
not
required,
under
the
decisions,
to
simply
ignore
the
feeling
of
the
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it,
and
say,
"well,
it
is
not
a
weapon,
so
we
can't
touch
it."
that
would
be
requiring
them
to
give
up
their
own
intelligent
common-sense
assessment,
which
yields
probable
cause
of
what
was
in
the
pocket
of
the
individual.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
is
an
entirely
different
quality
of
rights
that's
been
treated
entirely
differently
by
the
courts.
i
don't
think
that
it
reflects
on
the
decisions.
for
example,
guzman
v.
estelle,
in
a
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit,
dealt
with
this
problem.
and
also
a
recent
decision
of
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
united
states
v.
branch,
dealt
with
this
problem,
in
footnotes.
both
came
to
the
conclusion
that
when
in
the
course
of
a
proper
frisk
an
officer
feels
something
which
gives
him
probable
cause
to
believe
the
object
of
the
warrant
is
there,
he
is
not,
should
not
and
cannot
be
required
to
simply
ignore
it.
so,
this
is
position
we
take
on
the
first
argument.
we
maintain
that
the
justification
for
the
frisk
here
is
as
strong
as
in
any
of
this
court's
decisions
on
the
subject.
and
we
maintain
that
under
this
court's
decision
on
probable
cause
that
once
the
officer
--
in
light
of
all
the
background
facts
--
remember,
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
information
available
to
him
from
the
complaint
for
the
search
warrant.
once
he
had
felt
this
object
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
in
paragraph
4,
also,
your
honor,
excuse
me,
in
which
it
is
mentioned
to
the
informant
that
there
is
going
to
be
offered
for
sale
at
the
tavern
on
march
1st
--
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
only
logical
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
number
of
packets
that
are
present
and
from
the
willingness
of
greg
on
a
short-term
basis
to
have
it
for
sale
again
--
to
go
from
february
29th
and
have
it
for
sale
on
march
1st,
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
drawn
that
this
was
done
before.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
wouldn't
agree,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
language
here
and
the
background
information
is
that
limited.
i
think
that
would
be
unreasonable
reading
of
the
information.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
your
honor,
this
was
not
written
by
legal
scholars,
but
it
does
say
"has
been
in
the
tavern
on
at
the
least
ten
other
occasions
and
has
observed
the
tinfoil
packets
on
greg
and
in
a
drawer
behind
the
bar."
the
only
reason
for
mentioning
ten
other
occasions
and
then
following
it
by
the
other
clause
would
be
to
have
the
one
reflect
back
on
the
other,
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
but
admittedly,
both
in
the
search
warrant
complaint
and
in
the
testimony,
everything
is
not
spelled
out
word
for
word
exactly
as
you
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
it.
it
rarely
is
in
search
warrant
situations.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that's
one
of
the
--
certainly
the
ruling
of
the
appellate
court
below,
and
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
points
that
is
before
you,
yes.
that
is
not
the
point
which
we
are
arguing
first.
that
is
our
secondary
argument.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
we
are
not
sure
of
that,
but
the
indication
is
that
he
was
not.
but
i
am
not
sure
of
that
either,
at
least
at
this
point,
when
the
lawsuit
went
into
court.
now,
on
our
second
alternative
argument,
based
on
what
we
are
telling
the
court
--
what
we
are
arguing
--
is
that
if
johnson
did
lack
a
full
traditional
probable
cause
the
second
search,
that
search
that
turned
up
the
tinfoil
packets
of
heroin,
he
at
least
had
a
lesser
camara-type
probable
cause
or
a
terry
reasonable
belief,
that
the
bar
and/or
his
fellow
patrons
were
connected
with
the
illegal
drug
activity
on
the
premises,
and
may
have
had
the
objects
of
the
warrant
concealed
on
their
persons.
these
are
actually
two
different
possible
theories
on
which
the
court
could
affirm
the
decision
below,
one
of
them
argued
primarily
in
our
relief,
the
other
mentioned
in
footnote
10,
ascribed
to
professor
lefevre.
really,
regardless
of
which
theory
is
used,
they
are
both
two
parallel
ways
to
describe
the
same
basis
for
the
search,
the
same
information
and
reaching
the
same
result.
we
believe
that
the
lesser
reasonable
belief
test
is
more
appropriate
in
this
case.
that's
what
we
are
emphasizing,
primarily
because
it
is
a
matter
of
consistency
with
this
court's
prior
decisions,
and
also
trying
to
create
a
level
of
certainty
for
police
officers
to
operate
under.
we
think
either
theory
could
justify
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
below.
and,
of
course,
both
theories
involve
a
balancing
test
which
was
used
in
camara,
terry
and
other
cases
that
we
cite.
we
feel
that
under
a
balancing
test
--
we
feel
that
we
have
such
strong
governmental
interest
in
the
controlling
of
drug
traffic,
and
very
importantly,
i
think
--
very
importantly
--
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
warrantless
search
automobile
secondly,
that
cause
was
really
pre-terry
and
pre-camara,
and
therefore
it
never
really
considered
the
possibility
of
a
balancing
test
being
appropriate
in
some
situations.
our
issue
here,
our
specific
issue,
was
never
decided
in
that
case.
it
was
really
only
alluded
to.
for
the
reasons,
then,
stated
in
our
brief,
we
simply
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
