what
is
this
about
greg?
you
said
he
wasn't
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
there
was
a
bar
without
a
bartender?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they
be
attacked
after
they
patted
them
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they
have
been
attacked
after
they
patted
them
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
don't
have
any
justification
for
the
second
search
at
all,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
patted
down
a
man
coming
in
the
door?
and
i
want
to
be
fair
with
you,
if
you
answer
that
that
way
i
am
going
to
ask
you
could
you
pat
him
down
on
the
pavement?
and
you
can't
imagine
where
i
am
going
from
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mine
did
not
include
a
nun.
you
can
have
my
word
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
noel,
on
the
balancing
test,
no
guns
were
found
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
weapons
of
any
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
could
be
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
people
did
you
find
with
dope
in
this
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe?
where
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
presume
things
in
criminal
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
reasonable
inference
is
that
a
person
in
a
bar
has
a
gun.
that's
what
you
said
a
minute
ago,
and
you
didn't
find
any
guns,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
pointing
at
terry.
what
is
there
in
terry
to
give
you
the
right
to
search
for
dope?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
man
was
arrested
for
dope,
not
a
weapon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be
an
extension
of
terry
to
apply
it
to
dope?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
nothing
in
terry
about
dope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
man
was
casing
the
joint
to
rob
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
man
didn't
have
an
unexpired
license
or
anything.
he
was
lawfully
in
a
place
of
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
it
been
raided?
had
it
been
padlocked?
had
it
been
closed?
had
anything
been
done
to
tell
anybody
that
this
is
a
bad
place
to
be
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
knows
now.
he
knows
now.
he
is
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
also
take
recognition
of
the
fact
that
you
found
dope
didn't
justify
the
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
justify
either
search,
in
and
of
itself.
the
findings
of
dope
didn't
justify
it,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
trying
for
that,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
challenge
the
right
of
the
warrant
to
search
this
man.
