he
didn't
even
know
it
was
a
cigarette
package.

it

mr.
goldberg,
you
made
emphasis
on
the
difference
between,
what
you
call,
the
first
search
and
the
second
search.
how
much
time
lapsed
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
primary
concern
was
for
the
presence
of
weapons,
wasn't
it?
are
you
faulting
them
because
he
may
have
finished
his
primary
patdown
of
all
the
patrons
and
then
came
back
to
this
one,
or
that
he
should
have
taken
a
chance
on
the
presence
of
weapons,
and
number
10
down
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
reason
to
suspect
criminal
activity,
despite
the
contents
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
not
violence
and
gunplay
rather
common
in
narcotics
transactions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
imagine?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
was
this
particular
ground
presented
to
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
predicate
to
relying
on
terry
some
finding
that
the
officer
reasonably
feared
that
the
suspect
was
armed?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
fact-finding
like
that
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
it
you
never
relied
on
terry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
was
never
presented
--
how
could
any
court
have
addressed
the
predicate
to
terry,
if
the
terry
argument
was
never
made?
