mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
a
search
which
occurred
at
a
public
tavern
in
aurora,
illinois.
on
march
1,
1976,
at
about
4:10
in
the
afternoon,
a
group
of
at
least
eight
or
nine
police
officers
and
illinois
bureau
of
investigation
agents
entered
a
public
establishment
by
the
name
of
the
aurora
tavern.
their
purpose
was
to
execute
a
warrant
for
the
tavern,
the
premises
of
the
tavern,
and
the
bartender,
a
man
by
the
name
of
greg.
agent
jerome
johnson
announced
the
officers'
purpose
and
authority,
and
he
immediately
told
everyone
in
the
tavern
to
stand
for
a
search
for
weapons.
present
in
the
tavern
at
the
time
were
a
group
of
approximately
between
nine
and
thirteen
patrons,
including
my
client,
ventura
ybarra.
the
lighting
was
sufficient,
according
to
agent
johnson,
for
all
of
these
patrons
to
be
seen.
and
he
described
the
tavern
as
one
large
room,
with
one
entrance
and
one
exit.
johnson
testified
he
had
never
seen
any
of
the
patrons
before,
and
despite
never
having
seen
any
of
them
before,
he
then
proceeded
to
pat
all
of
them
down.
and
he
did
this
even
though
he
testified
he
had
no
knowledge
that
any
had
committed
an
offense,
and
no
indication
that
mr.
ybarra
had
a
gun
or
was
hostile
or
was
hiding
anything.
mr.
ybarra's
hands
were
visible
to
him
at
all
times.
he
had
no
knowledge
that
ybarra
owned
or
worked
at
the
premises,
which
he
did
not.
he
was
merely
a
patron.
in
patting
down
mr.
ybarra,
he
testified
that
he
felt
no
weapon
at
all
during
that
patdown.
he
felt
a
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it.
that
was
his
testimony.
he
did
not
see
the
object
immediately.
he
completed
the
patdown
of
the
remaining
patrons,
a
task
which
took
several
minutes.
he
then
returned
to
ybarra
and
he
searched
ybarra
again.
and
he
searched
ybarra
again,
even
though
he
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
at
that
time
that
ybarra
and
any
contraband
or
any
of
the
items
they
were
looking
for.
ybarra
hadn't
moved
between
the
two
searches,
and
at
all
times
his
hands
had
been
on
the
bar,
between
the
two
searches.
during
the
second
search
of
ybarra,
the
officer
found
six
tinfoil
packets
containing
heroin.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
in
cook
county,
illinois,
the
prosecutor
conceded
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
search.
instead,
he
relied
on
a
statute,
and
that
is
illinois
revised
statute,
chapter
38,
section
108-9,
which
says
that
in
executing
a
warrant
a
police
officer
may
reasonably
detain
to
search
anyone
present
at
the
time
of
the
execution,
in
order
to
a)
protect
himself
from
attack,
or
b)
prevent
he
disposal
or
concealment
of
any
of
the
instruments,
articles
or
things
named
in
the
warrant.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
if
he
had
observed
factors
which
would
have
warranted
patdown
in
terry,
he
could
have
performed
it
without
the
authority
of
the
statute.
there
is
little
question
about
that.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
is
that
the
premises
are
smaller
and
more
private,
and
the
number
of
people
there
are
less
than
the
reasonable
suspicion,
goes
greater
that
they
are
involved
in
the
criminal
activity,
necessarily.
i
think
this
particular
set
of
facts
was
a
public
place
and
nine
to
thirteen
patrons
in
a
place
where
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
an
involvement
is
far
beyond
any
line
that
might
t
be
drawn.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
necessarily
a
line
would
have
to
be
drawn
somewhere,
but
that
line,
i
think,
is
provided
in
terry
v.
ohio.
if
the
circumstances
are
such
that
the
officers
could
reasonably
suspect
or
in
the
case
of
--
not
a
weapon
search
but
a
search
for
contraband,
and
if
they
had
probable
cause,
under
the
circumstances,
to
believe
that
the
persons
were
involved
in
criminal
activity,
then
they
could
search
them.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
in
your
exposes
hypothetical,
of
course,
that
would
be
a
question
of
probability
of
danger
to
the
officers.
and
terry,
of
course,
is
the
weapons
situation,
and
reasonable
suspicion
would
be
sufficient
under
those
circumstances.
now,
if
they
walk
into
a
place
and
they
have
only
a
hunch
that
a
person
might
be
involved,
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
and,
traditionally,
of
course,
when
you
are
talking
about
searching
someone
for
contraband,
as
opposed
to
a
weapon,
the
court
has
always
spoken
in
terms
of
probable
cause.
but
the
distinction
which
the
state
seeks
to
draw,
saying
that,
"well,
you
should
only
require
reasonable
suspicion
here,"
i
don't
think
that's
one
that
really
has
any
relevance
here,
because
they
had
nothing.
they
had
no
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
here.
whether
you
consider
it
a
weapons
search
or
a
search
for
contraband,
there
was
no
sort
of
suspicion
at
all.
so
those
differing
degrees
in
which
there
are
smaller
premises,
more
reason
to
believe
a
person
is
involved,
obviously
all
present
closer
questions.
but
this
particular
set
of
facts,
since
there
was
nothing
at
all,
there
is
absolutely
no
suspicion
of
any
kind.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
the
bartender
was
named
in
the
warrant,
greg,
and
so
i
would
be
able
to
make
this
argument.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
if
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
regarding
the
first
patdown,
you
can
be
patted
down,
and
there
simply
wasn't
here.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
for
a
weapon.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
right.
now,
the
particular
portion
of
this
illinois
statute
that
was
relied
on
was
not
a
weapons
section.
it
was
no
a)
to
protect
themselves
from
danger.
it
was
b)
to
prevent
the
disposal
or
concealment
of
any
instruments,
articles
or
things
named
in
the
warrant.
and
it
is
simply
our
contention
that
neither
of
these
searches
were
performed
--
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
--
with
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
there
was
no
articulable
standard
in
that
at
all.
the
only
reason
for
the
search,
apparently,
was
the
mere
presence
of
the
patrons
in
the
place
where
the
search
warrant
was
being
executed.
and
that
is
a
rationale
for
search
that
this
court
has
consistently
rejected.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
talk
of
this
narcotics
dealing
being
open
and
notorious
is
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
in
this
court.
that
contention
had
never
been
made
before,
and
the
reason
it
has
never
been
made
before
is
that
it
is
simply
untrue.
there
was
no
indication
that
someone
who
walked
into
this
bar
would
have
been
aware
that
narcotics
dealing
was
going
on.
the
officer
testified
himself
that
he
had
no
suspicions
that
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
i
think
the
state's
assertion
is
that
when
in
walking
into
the
bar
the
patrons
gave
up
their
expectation
of
privacy;
they
walked
into
a
bar
where
they
should
have
known
narcotics
going
on.
and
my
assertion
is
they
could
not
have
known
narcotics
dealing
was
going
on,
because
it
wasn't
open.
if,
by
open,
they
mean
that
the
bartender
was
standing
behind
the
bar
and
selling
narcotics
as
openly
as
he
was
selling
alcohol,
that's
simply
not
true.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no,
there
was
no
need
for
it.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no.
the
complaint
for
search
warrant
indicated
only
this.
it
indicated
that
an
informant
had
been
in
the
bar
the
previous
day,
and
had
seen
tinfoil
packages
the
previous
day
behind
the
bar,
and
on
the
person
of
greg
the
bartender.
and
he
knew
the
tinfoil
packets
were
a
method
of
packaging
heroin,
and
he
had
been
told
that
heroin
would
be
for
sale
on
that
day,
march
1,
1976,
the
day
on
which
the
warrant
was
executed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
complaint
for
search
warrant
contrary
to
the
state's
contention.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
he
could
have
searched
the
premises,
that
is
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
he
could
have
searched
behind
the
bar,
he
could
have
searched
objects
on
the
premises,
and
he
could
have
searched
the
bartender,
greg.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
because
the
people,
by
virtue
of
being
there,
did
not
become
part
of
the
premises.
if
that
were
so,
if
the
people
simply
by
virtue
of
being
there
were
like
--
became
like
the
bar
or
any
of
the
objects
in
the
bar,
then
the
warrant
would
be
a
general
warrant.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
if
that
were
his
personal
possession,
it
is
not
part
of
the
premises.
it
is
his.
he
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
it.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
it
has
to
be
something
which
the
officers
could
reasonably
believe
could
contain
the
contraband.
and
certainly,
for
example,
a
case
in
which
beer,
a
case
of
beer
which
clearly
would
belong
to
the
bar,
although
not
a
fixture,
would
be
amenable
for
search
for
the
contraband.
but
an
individual
walking
into
the
bar,
where
the
police,
as
here,
don't
have
any
reason
to
suspect
him
of
involvement
in
any
way,
he
is
not
amenable
to
search,
simply
because
there
is
a
search
warrant
being
executed
on
the
premises.
in
other
words,
a
person
is
not
part
of
the
premises.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no,
i
think
in
that
instance,
it
would
be
a
general
warrant.
there
has
to
be
some
reason
to
authorize
a
search
of
people
in
a
search
warrant.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
if
it
said,
for
example,
that
the
patrons,
among
them
ventura
ybarra,
were
involved
in
the
criminal
activity,
i
would
have
no
argument.
but
if
it
said
that
some
patrons
are
involved,
or
indicated
some
patrons
were
involved
and
implied
that
some
were
not,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
similar,
although
not
as
obvious
problem.
at
least
in
that
instance,
there
would
be
some
suspicion
regarding
the
group
of
patrons,
but
here
there
is
no
suspicion
regarding
anybody.
i
think
that
would
be
a
little
more
difficult
problem,
where
some
are
suspected
and
some
are
not.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
the
only
person
suspected
is
the
bartender,
and
it
appears
from
the
record
that
the
bartender
wasn't
even
there
when
the
warrant
was
executed.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
complaint
for
search
warrant
for
just
a
second,
because
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
what
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
complaint.
the
complaint
only
indicates
that
greg
is
involved,
and
the
tinfoil
packets
are
on
the
bar,
behind
the
bar,
i
should
say.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
they
are
in
view
of
the
customers,
no
indication
that
the
informant
saw
this
as
a
general
patron
of
the
tavern.
presumably,
he
was
behind
the
bar
when
he
saw
it.
nothing
in
the
circumstances
when
the
officers
entered
indicates
that
narcotics
dealing
at
the
point
was
open
and
notorious.
they
had
no
indication
that
there
was
narcotics
dealing
going
on
when
they
walked
in,
from
their
position
at
the
doorway.
and
again
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
yes,
"that
the
informant
advised
me
that
over
the
weekend
of
28-29
february
he
had
a
conversation
with
greg,
and
was
advised
that
greg
would
have
heroin
for
sale
on
monday,
march
1,
1976."
in
my
mind,
the
only
thing
that
one
can
logically
infer
to
that
is
that
this
informant,
or
anybody
who
knew
that
greg
had
heroin
for
sale,
could
go
up
to
greg
and
purchase
heroin,
but
that
a
lawful
patron
who
walked
in
to
buy
a
beer
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
narcotics
dealing
was
going
on.
i
think
this
would
be
true
that
any
time
there
is
some
illegal
activity
going
on
in
a
public
place,
normally,
the
patrons
of
that
public
place
are
not
going
to
be
privy
to
the
information
that
there
is
unlawful
activity
going
on
there.
and
unless
the
police
can
somehow
particularize
the
reason
to
believe
that
a
particular
individual
is
involved
in
the
unlawful
activity,
then
they
cannot
search
him
merely
because
they
have
a
warrant
for
the
premises.
the
state
has
offered
a
new
rule
to
justify
the
search
in
this
case.
their
rule
is
that
a
patdown
is,
par
se,
permissible
at
the
scene
of
a
search
warrant,
where
officers
do
not
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
person
has
no
connection
to
the
premises
or
the
criminal
activity.
that
is
set
out
in
their
brief.
this
rule
has,
i
think,
several
infirmities.
first,
it
violates
all
the
general
principles
we
have
been
talking
about
this
morning,
the
rule
that
mere
presence
at
the
scene
of
suspected
criminal
activity
doesn't
lead
to
an
inference
that
one
is
involved.
second,
again,
it
would
make
every
warrant
into
a
general
warrant.
and
it
would
also
apparently
put
the
burden
on
the
person
to
be
searched
to
avoid
being
searched.
he
would
have
to
demonstrate
to
the
officers
that
he
was
not
involved
in
the
criminal
activity,
that
he
was
not
connected
with
the
premises
in
order
to
avoid
search,
instead
of
requiring
the
officers
to
articulate
the
reasons
why
they
are
searching.
as
a
result,
it
could
subject
virtually
anyone
to
a
search,
on
the
basis
not
of
specific
knowledge
on
the
part
of
police,
but
because
they
had
no
knowledge,
just
because
they
had
no
knowledge
about
that
person.
under
the
state's
test,
they
could
search
him.
even
if
this
initial
patdown,
this
first
intrusion
in
the
case
had
been
permissible,
it
wasn't
the
end
of
it.
there
was
a
second
search
here.
even
though
the
officer
testified
he
hadn't
found
a
weapon,
even
though
all
he
had
felt
was
what
he
described
as
a
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it,
there
was
a
second
search.
he
explicitly
testified
that
he
believed,
after
the
first
search
and
before
the
second
search,
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
ventura
ybarra
had
any
contraband.
that
was
his
very
testimony.
he
didn't
have
any
knowledge
that
ventura
ybarra
had
any
contraband.
and
despite
that
he
went
ahead
and
searched
him
again
a
second
time.
i
think
the
reason
why
officer
johnson
honestly
admitted
he
had
no
knowledge
is
because
the
feeling
through
a
patdown
of
a
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it
can't
logically
give
one
any
reasonable
suspicion
of
probable
cause.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
he
was
there,
and
there
was
no
testimony
that
he
was
present.
and
in
the
closing
argument
in
the
suppression
hearing,
the
argument
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
time
the
warrant
was
executed.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
apparently,
there
was
another
bartender
there
by
the
name
of
peggy
miller
who
--
on
whom
the
warrant
was
served,
but
greg
apparently
was
not
there,
the
person
who
was
dealing
narcotics.
now,
this
second
search
on
the
basis
of
no
suspicion
or
probable
cause
was
improper
because
the
feeling
of
the
cigarette
package
with
the
object
in
it
could
not
logically
lead
one
to
conclude
anything
about
the
person.
the
officer
didn't
feel
what
the
objects
were.
they
could
have
been
a
lighter
or
a
book
of
matches
or
any
other
innocent
object,
and
that's
why
he
honestly
testified
that
he
didn't
have
any
knowledge
that
there
was
any
contraband
on
ventura
ybarra
at
that
point.
now,
the
state
also
offers
an
alternative
argument
in
their
brief,
and
that
is
that
the
pat
down
of
all
people
on
the
premises
when
the
officers
entered
was
permissible
not
as
a
search
or
weapons
but
as
a
search
for
contraband,
based
on
reasonable
suspicion.
and,
at
some
length,
they
discussed
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
should
apply
in
a
situation
like
this.
while
the
decision
of
this
court
would
indicate
that
probable
cause
is
the
relevant
standard
when
the
search
is
for
contraband,
in
this
case
the
search
would
have
been
impermissible
under
any
standard,
because
there
is
no
suspicion
of
any
kind.
the
only
suspicion
offered
by
the
state,
again,
is
their
assertion
that
the
narcotics
dealing
was
open
and
notorious,
and,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
officer's
testimony,
the
circumstances
which
confronted
the
officer,
the
complaint
for
search
warrant,
all
indicate
that
there
was
nothing
about
the
criminal
activity
on
these
premises
that
was
open
and
notorious.
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
lawful
patron
would
know
of
the
criminal
activity.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
if
the
officer,
in
patting
someone
down,
had
found
heroin,
and,
of
course,
in
patting
someone
down
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
find
heroin,
since
you
are
limited
to
the
outer
garments,
but
if
the
officer
had
found
heroin
on
the
initial
patdown,
it
would
have
been
equally
illegal
because
that
initial
patdown
was
illegal.
so,
it
would
be
our
argument
that
both
the
initial
intrusion
was
illegal,
because
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify,
and
that
the
second
patdown
was
--
or
the
second
search
was
impermissible
because
there
was
neither
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
i
would
say
so,
because
the
feeling
of
a
cigarette
pack
with
objects
in
it
cannot
logically
give
rise
to
any
suspicion
that
a
person
has
some
contraband
on
his
person.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
the
search
warrant
doesn't
allege
that
a
cigarette
pack
is
a
normal
way
of
carrying
heroin.
i
imagine
there
are
a
myriad
number
of
containers
in
which
heroin
can
be
carried.
but
even
though
the
officers
knew
or
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
here
was
heroin
on
the
premises,
feeling
a
cigarette
package
doesn't
give
one
probable
cause
to
believe
that
person
has
heroin.
maybe
half
of
the
patrons
would
have
a
cigarette
package,
in
those
circumstances.
if
that
were
true,
that
he
patron
on
whom
--
that
the
officers
patted
own
on
whom
they
felt
the
cigarette
package
--.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no,
but
the
officer
didn't
feel
those
six
tinfoil
packets
of
heroin
in
the
initial
patdown.
the
only
thing
he
could
say
was
that
he
felt
the
cigarette
package
with
objects
in
it.
and
then
he
further
said
that
even
after
feeling
that
cigarette
packet
with
objects
in
it
he
didn't
have
any
knowledge
that
ybarra
had
contraband.
so
he
attached
no
significance
to
the
feeling
of
the
cigarette
package
with
objects
in
it.
as
far
as
he
knew
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
well,
i
think
he
indicated,
at
one
point
in
his
testimony,
that
he
felt
nothing,
and
then
later
on,
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
prosecutor,
he
said
he
felt
what
he
thought
was
a
cigarette
pack.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
it
might
not
have
been
a
cigarette
package.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
variously
it
is
described
in
the
record
as
three
minutes
or
ten
minutes.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
we
are
faulting
him
as
to
both.
in
other
words,
the
officer
had
no
reason
and
indicated
in
his
testimony
that
he
had
no
reason
to
suspect
any
of
the
patrons
of
criminal
activity,
and
so
there
was
no
justification
for
the
initial
intrusion,
the
initial
patdown.
and
then
beyond
that,
after
feeling
no
weapons
and
feeling
nothing
which
would
give
him
probable
cause
to
believe
that
ventura
ybarra
had
contraband,
he
went
and
made
a
second
search.
so,
on
both
points
we
believe
the
intrusions
were
improper.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no
reason
with
respect
to
the
first
patdown
to
suspect
that
any
of
these
patrons
were
involved,
by
his
own
admission,
by
his
own
testimony.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
i
imagine
that
in
narcotics
transactions
violence
and
gunplay
may
be
involved,
but
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
i
accept
that
it
is,
and
i
accept
that
under
circumstances
in
which
search
warrants
for
narcotics
are
being
executed
there
may
be
many
circumstances
in
which
the
police
find
it
necessary
to
pat
down
all
the
people
there.
this
officer
didn't
think
it
was
necessary.
this
officer
didn't
have
any
indication
that
there
was
any
gunplay
that
was
to
be
involved.
there
was
nothing
in
the
circumstances,
by
his
own
admission,
that
gave
him
any
indication
that
there
was
any
involvement
on
the
part
of
the
patrons
in
criminal
activity.
and
he,
himself,
admitted
he
simply
didn't
think
the
patrons
were
involved.
maybe
it
is
a
unique
situation,
but
i
think
there
will
be
many
search
warrants
for
public
places,
and
those
search
warrants
by
themselves
cannot
give
the
police
authority
to
pat
down
everybody
in
a
public
place.
if
the
police
have
some
suspicion,
if
they
have
some
reason
to
proceed
in
that
manner,
then
we
have
no
objection
to
it.
but
this
officer
admitted
he
didn't
have
any
reason
for
proceeding
in
that
manner.
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
both
the
initial
intrusion
and
the
second
search
were
improper.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
that
would
obviously
be
a
much
stronger
case
for
the
state,
if
the
officer
suspected
as
a
result
of
the
patdown
that
the
person
possessed
the
narcotics
named
in
the
warrant.
and
of
course
that's
not
the
situation
that
prevails
here.
but
it
seems
to
me
--
and
we
don't
rely
alone
on
the
waiting
for
the
second
see
here,
as
the
reason
why
it
was
improper,
because
there
is
the
additional
testimony
of
the
officer
that
he
didn't
believe
he
had
any
contraband.
but
certainly
that
would
be
a
much
stronger
case.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
i
think
the
test
for
a
patdown
is
a
reasonably
articulable
suspicion.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
it
certainly
is
an
objective
test.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
if
there
was
an
indication
in
the
record
that
the
objective
facts
somehow
were
contrary
to
the
officers'
conclusions
here,
we
simply
wouldn't
even
referring
to
the
officers.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
about
narcotics.
we
would
think
probable
cause
as
a
standard.
but,
in
either
event,
it's
an
objective
test.
but
here,
obviously,
the
officer's
own
conclusions
are
extremely
relevant.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
that
was
the
conclusions
that
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
no.
i
believe
that
the
appellate
court
and
the
trial
court
have
held
that
on
the
basis
of
this
statute,
which
they
--
in
the
manner
in
which
they
applied
it
--
must
have
believed
created
a
per
se
rule
that
everybody
on
the
premises
can
be
searched.
i
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
thank
you.
all
i
really
wish
to
say
at
this
point
is
that
although
counsel
for
the
state
constantly
refers
to
the
terry
opinion,
nothing
in
terry
supports
an
automatic
right
to
frisk
in
this
situation.
terry
sets
forth
a
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
belief.
and
the
state's
position,
in
part
1
of
their
brief,
is
that
they
can
frisk
automatically
when
they
are
executing
a
warrant
without
reasonable
suspicion,
and
terry
simply
doesn't
support
that
position.
and
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that,
again,
the
state
contends
that
somewhere
in
this
record
there
is
an
indication
that
drug
traffic
was
open
and
notorious.
i
have
gone
through
the
factors
in
the
record
that
i
think
indicate
just
the
opposite,
and
indicate
that
the
officer's
belief
was
just
the
opposite.
i
would
argue
until
i
am
blue
in
the
face
that
it
wasn't
open
and
notorious,
and
the
state
is
really
saying
nothing
any
more
than
contradicting
me.
they
are
not
pointing
to
anything
in
the
record
--
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
that
gets
to
the
other
point
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
reason
for
suspicion
for
its
second
intrusion.
and
then
at
that
point
the
trial
attorney
objects
and
the
court
says,
basically,
"you
can't
tell
us
what
you
felt,
you
have
to
tell
us
what
you
felt,
you
have
to
tell
us
what
facts
led
you
to
reach
that
belief."
mr.
alan
d.
goldberg
right.
at
that
point
--
this
is
the
preliminary
hearing
--
it
does
seem
to
indicate
a
subjective
belief.
everywhere
else
in
the
record
he
says
he
doesn't
have
a
subjective
belief.
at
this
point,
which
is
about
a
month
before
the
suppression
hearing,
he
seemed
to
think
so.
when
he
reconsidered
his
testimony
later
on,
he
didn't
have
that
subjective
belief.
perhaps,
he
had
realized
himself
how
illogical
it
was
to
feel
a
cigarette
pack
and
think
that
it
contains
heroin.
that
was
just
a
hunch.
and
that
also
invalidates
the
second
search.
thank
you.
