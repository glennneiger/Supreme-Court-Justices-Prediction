mr.
allen,
before
you
get
into
that,
i
notice
in
your
reply
brief,
page
7,
the
statement,
"hew
intends
to
institute
rulemaking
with
respect
to
patient
participation."
how
does
that
matter
stand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
did
and
provide
for
patient
participation,
might
we
have
a
situation
where
we
don't
have
to
reach
a
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
hew
fixed
any
timetable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
be
a
protracted
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
matter
of
months,
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
patients
were
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
mean
termination
would
require
their
transfer
to
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
patients
to
do
this,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
fairly
large
number,
relatively?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
posner,
you
mentioned
that
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
statutory
law
the
patients
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
they're
transferred
to
another
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
rely
on
that
statute
as
giving
them
a
right
to,
statutory
right
to
participate
in
this
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean
a
hearing,
to
participate
in
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
home
shall
be
disqualified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
one
of
your
arguments
then
is
it
is
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law,
you're
entitled
to
the
hearing
you
seek?
