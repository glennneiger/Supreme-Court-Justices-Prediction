justice
potter
stewart
and
your
client's
predecessor
did
not
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
a
question
that
remains
here,
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
jurisdiction
of
your
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
favor
of
the
government,
wasn't
it,
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
united
states
is
a
respondent
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
mr.
allen,
neither
you
nor
anybody
else
knows
what
the
rule
may
turn
out
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
this
home
was
in
philadelphia?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wondering,
there
were
therefore
alternative
providers,
qualified
providers?
justice
potter
stewart
this
home,
in
other
words,
was
not
in
a
small
town
where
there
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
no
other
nursing
home
around?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
hew
was
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
respondent
can
none
the
less
petition
for
review,
a
respondent
in
the
court
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
now
in
this
court--
justice
potter
stewart
the
united
states
is
technically
a
respondent.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
did
petition,
didn't
it,
for
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
did
not.
justice
potter
stewart
only
the
state
secretary
did?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
your
claim
that
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
were
what
conferred
a
property
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
what
confers
a
due
process
rights
not
to
be
deprived
of
that
property
with
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
point
is
that
if
a
state
construes
its
law,
statutory
or
common
law
or
state
constitutional
law,
in
a
way
that
contravenes
the
federal
constitution,
then
it
becomes
a
matter
for
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that's
your
argument,
isn't
it?
