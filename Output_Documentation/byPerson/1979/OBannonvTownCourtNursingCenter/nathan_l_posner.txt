mr.
nathan
l.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
reference
made
here
to
a
reply
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
did
receive
a
copy
of
it
last
night
when
i
checked
into
my
hotel,
so
i
must
confess
to
the
court
that
i
haven't
given
it
the
consideration
that
i
might
ordinarily
give
a
brief.
my
order
of
priority
is
in
the
first
instance
to
challenge
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
be
heard
in
this
matter.
she
is
secretary
of
the
department
of
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
she
was
directed
to
continue
payments
at
town
court
even
after
she
declared
the
court
to
be
an
unqualified
provider.
the
petitioner
--
i
am
referring
to
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
welfare
--
filed
no
appeal
or
cross-appeal
from
that
injunction.
hew
was
not
involved
in
that
injunction.
there
were
no
medicare
patients
at
the
institution.
their
appeal
concerned
town
court
under
title
18.
the
petitioner
--
again
i
refer
to
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
welfare
--
characterizes
herself
as
a
stakeholder.
her
attorney
stated
her
position
as
follows
-
she
took
no
position
for
or
against
the
factual
issues
raised
by
the
patients
or
hew.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
this
case
to
the
lower
court,
and
i
refer
to
the
case
of
the
patients,
only.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
represented
town
court
in
the
original
hearing;
i
represented
the
patients
with
permission
of
counsel
for
the
patients,
mr.
coyle,
who
is
seated
in
this
courtroom.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
here
i
represent
only
the
patients
at
this
time.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
involving
the
patients
to
the
lower
court,
and
it
heard
many
witnesses
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
would
like
to
think
that,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
only
named
six
and
we're
asking
that
we
be
identified
as
a
class
for
the
whole
198,
yes.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
not
at
this
stage,
but
in
the
proceedings
before
the
district
court
which
have
not
been
completed.
this
case
was
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
at
this
point
nothing
is
before
the
court
because
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
when
the
court
was
hearing
evidence
on
our
request
for
injunctive
relief,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
interruption
of
the
evidence
at
that
time,
and
i
will
refer
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
sir,
because
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
when
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
lower
court.
it
left
to
the
lower
court,
when
it
remanded
the
case
of
the
patients,
the
procedures,
and
i
use
their
language,
in
the
case
which
has
been
interrupted
by
the
appeal
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
i
interpret
that
to
mean
that
completion
of
the
case
before
the
lower
court
was
then
in
order,
and
depending
on
how
the
court
held
concerning
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
matter
would
again
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
possibly
to
this
court
that
the
parties
weren't
satisfied
with
it.
petitioner
again
took
no
appeal
nor
position
and
they
come
before
this
court
and
seek
review.
and
i
ask
-
review
of
what?
the
remanding
of
the
case
to
the
lower
court
for
completion?
obviously
he's
not
appealing
that
or
reviewing
that.
or
does
she
rely
on
the
issue
raised
by
hew?
if
she
does,
that
issue
concerns
town
court
under
title
18,
medicare,
and
did
not
involve
the
patients.
it
was
decided
in
favor
of
hew.
the
issue
was
put
to
rest.
no
other
issue
remained.
our
argument
is
that
the
petitioner's
obligation
to
the
patients
that
we
represent
arises
under
pennsylvania
statutory
law.
this
was
not
questioned
by
the
petitioner
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
remarked
about
it.
they
stated,
"plaintiff
has
not
cross
appealed.
the
propriety
of
the
order
entered
against
her
is
not
before
us."
i
say
to
this
court
that
hew
had
its
issue
decided
.hew
cannot
be
involved
in
a
suit
by
the
patients
against
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
under
our
statutory
law.
they
have
no
right,
nor
should
they
be
permitted
to
attack
the
remand
order
for
the
completion
of
the
case
involving
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
patients
never
sought
any
rights
against
hew.
their
rights
have
always
been
against
the
commonwealth,
and
hew
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
their
claim
for
protection.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
only
as
respects
town
court
in
taking
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
decided
in
its
favor.
hew
was
decidedly
correct
that
they
did
not
have
the
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
there
were
of
course
appeals
for
hew
and
we
took--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
in
this
court
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
think
this
case
lies
between
us
--
and
i
say
"us,"
the
patients;
we,
the
patients
--
and
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
involved
or
should
be
invoked.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
did
not,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
only
in
the--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
if
that
occasion
should
arise,
sir,
right
now
their
interests
are
parallel.
they
believe
a
hearing
should
take
place.
should
some
issue
arise,
and
it
has
not
arisen,
mr.
coyle,
who
is
seated
in
this
courtroom
and
whose
name
appears
on
this
brief,
will
take
over
on
behalf
of
the
patients.
until
that
time,
i
believe
our
courses
are
parallel
and
at
this
point
i
am
representing
only
the
patients.
but
should
there
be
any
slight
suggestion,
sir,
i
personally
would
walk
out
and
would
ask
mr.
coyle,
or
he
would
demand
that
i
walk
out.
so
i
see
no
problem
there,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
incompatibility
between
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
would
suppose
to
some
extent
the
answer
must
be
yes
to
that,
sir.
but
let
me
put
it
this
way
--
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no,
sir.
hew
was
not
concerned
with
the
violations
of
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
our
case,
the
patients'
case
is
strictly
against
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
well,
that's
the
only
problem
that
is
before
this
court
today,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
right,
infringement
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
correct,
sir.
shall
i
proceed?
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
the
legal
issues
involved
here
are
few
but
i
think
it
resolves
itself,
if
you
please,
as
to
whether
or
not
these
patients
are
entitled
to
a
pre-termination
hearing
before
they
are
removed
from
their
present
home
to
a
non-designated
place
not
yet
selected
by
the
authorities.
i
say
the
issue
therefore
is
one
of
due
process.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
well,
sir,
there's
a
real
question
about
it.
the
patients
in
the
first
instance
should
be
able
to
find
their
home
according
to
the
authorities
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
to
a
large
extent,
sir,
i
would
say
to
a
great
majority,
they
selected
this
home,
either
themselves
or
their
relatives
or
by
referral
of
physicians
or
by
hospitals.
you
see,
hospitals
usually
refer
patients
to
a
skilled
nursing
institute
when
their
program
cannot
encompass
the
treatment
of
such
patients,
which
require
just
constant
nursing
care.
we
have
what
is
known
in
pennsylvania
as
the
medical
assistance
program
which
does
not
permit
transfer
of
patients
to
another
facility
without
first
affording
those
patients
a
factual
hearing
as
to
whether
the
move
is
for
the
welfare
of
the
patients,
and
during
the
course
of
this
argument,
i
am
going
to
constantly
say
to
your
honors
that
the
welfare
of
the
patients
has
been
forgotten
by
both
hew
and
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
they
are
only
interested
in
rules
and
regulations
which
i
will
refer
to.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
don't
think
it
is
any
of
your
business,
if
your
honor
puts
it
that
way,
as
to
how
pennsylvania
construes
it,
but
if
they
construe
it
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
land
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
--
becomes
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause,
then
it
becomes
the
business
of
this
court.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
think
anything,
and
i
will
not
restrict
it
to
contracts,
sir,
anything
that
involves,
as
i
will
argue,
life,
liberty,
and
property
dealing
with
personal
rights
that
is
offended
or
affected
by
a
state
contrary
to
its
own
statutes
therefore
becomes
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
have
the
right
to
request
a
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
commonwealths
from
acting
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
those
people.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
won't
answer
that
question,
if
your
honor
pleases,
because
i
am
concerned
now
with
something
much
more
serious,
the
immediate
removal
from
a
home
of
people
that
regard
this
as
the
only
home
they
have
in
the
world.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
think
it
might
be
very
serious,
sir,
and
whether
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
don't
know.
i
couldn't
tell
your
honor
at
this
point
that
that
would
or
would
not
be
a
violation.
but
if
there
comes
a
problem,
i
will
try
to
answer
it.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
statutory
right
to
participate
in
this
proceeding,
sir?
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
when
you
say
the
matter
before
the
supreme
court?
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
definitely,
sir,
pre-termination
hearing
so
that
they
can
offer
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
i
will
show
you
that
the
code
of
federal
regulations
also
provides
for
that
hearing.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
if
your
honor
pleases,
in
this
very
case,
five
witnesses
were
called.
every
one
of
them
experts,
to
testify
concerning
their
experience
in
the
field
and
why
this
home
was
most
proper
and
fitting
to
be
a
skilled
nursing
home
and
should
be
licensed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
later
in
my
argument
i
will
state
to
your
honors
that
despite
what
hew
has
directed
the
secretary
of
welfare
to
do
in
pennsylvania,
the
authority,
as
mr.
watkins
very
well
put
it,
the
determining
factor
is
department
of
health,
and
the
department
of
health
has
given
us
the
license.
there
is
a
license
to
town
court
in
this
matter
that
they
can
exist
as
a
nursing
home.
the
only
problem
is
that
the
secretary
of
welfare
will
not
honor
that
statement
by
the
department
of
health
because
hew
says
well,
let
them
go
somewhere
else.
now,
i
am
anticipating
an
argument
i
intended
to
make
in
the
future,
but
i
think
it's
most
important
to
point
that
out
in
this
court
at
this
time.
we,
patients,
say
that
this
is
a
legitimate
nursing
home.
we
the
patients
say
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
through
its
department
of
health
has
given
a
license
to
this
place
to
operate,
and
it
is
in
existence
today.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
did
not
have
a
hearing,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no.
they're
only
entitled,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
a
post-termination
hearing.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no,
sir,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
pardon
me?
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
may
be,
sir,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
qualify
under
federal
standards
for
these
patients.
these
patients
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no,
sir.
these
patients
are
entitled
to
assistance
under
the
pennsylvania
law
through
an
act
of
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
which
gives
the
right
to
them
to
secure
assistance,
which
means
nursing
care,
et
cetera,
and
a
provider
agreement
is
entered
into
between
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
a
nursing
home
for
skilled
nursing
care
to
these
people.
hew
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
these
people
have
no
connection
with
hew.
their
only
claim
here
is
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
defeating
them
of
their
rights
to
maintain
their
home.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
by
violating
its
own
law?
i
would
say,
sir,
the
secretary
of
welfare
is
adhering
to
the
request
of
hew.
the
department
of
health
says
this
is
a
very
proper
place
for
these
patients
to
be.
we'll
give
them
a
license
to
operate,
and
they
have
given
them
a
license.
this
is
not
a
place
that
you
would
say
is
to
the
detriment
of
these
people.
it
is
perfectly
proper,
and
if
they
had
to
be
removed
from
another
home
to
another
place,
your
department
of
health
in
pennsylvania
would
definitely
take
the
position
that
this
was
a
proper
nursing
home
for
them
to
go
to
because
they
are
a
licensed
nursing
home.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
submit
to
your
honor
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
has
stated
that
on
many
occasions.
but
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
pennsylvania
law
so
that
it
affects
a
person's
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
becomes
a
federal
matter.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
well
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
my
argument,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that's
just
the
situation,
sir.
in
that
post
hearing
which
is
now
two
years
old
and
hasn't
taken
place
and
we
have
one
five
years
old
that
hasn't
taken
place,
the
patients
will
have
been
removed
to
another
place.
you
couldn't
effect
the
status
quo
anymore.
the
damage
to
them
will
have
been
done.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
the
post
hearings?
as
far
as
the
nursing
home
is
concerned?
hew.
we
have
an
action
instituted
in
the
district
court
of
pennsylvania
through
one
lawyer
representing
this
home
which
takes
the
position
that
this
court
has
taken,
and
i
am
referring
to
the
horse
trainer
case
that
your
honors
recently
ruled
upon,
that
the
failure
of
the
government,
hew,
to
grant
that
post-termination
hearing
in
due
time
forbid
them
from
proceeding
in
any
fashion
toward
the
decertifying
of
this
home.
but
that
is
a
matter
before
the
district
court
now.
what
i
must
do
here,
sirs,
i
must
draw
not
a
picture,
a
sketch,
if
you
will,
of
what
these
patients
call
home,
and
why
the
removal
of
them
from
that
home
is
a
deprivation
of
their
life
and
liberty.
their
world,
if
the
court
please,
these
patients
--
they
are
75,
80,
85
years
of
age
--
has
been
reduced
to
the
surroundings
within
the
home.
the
other
patients,
the
nurses,
the
attendants.
visitors,
relatives,
occasionally
visit
them.
they
are
chronically
ill
persons.
they
are
infirm.
they
suffer
from
many
diseases,
from
cancer
to
cardiovascular
problems.
they
know
each
other,
and
they
know
each
other's
problems.
they
talk
together
about
their
aches
and
pains,
and
even
world
problems.
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
ill
and
infirm,
if
the
court
pleases,
the
small
world
that
they
have
is
their
home,
the
only
home
they
know.
the
people
in
there
are
their
friends.
it
had
been
reduced
to
that.
the
nurses
in
there
know
them.
they
don't
apologize
because
of
the
serious
condition
that
causes
a
nurse
to
take
care
of
a
situation
that
embarrasses
the
patient.
they
are
not
there
to
await
death,
because
in
the
minds
of
all
people,
most
all
people,
hope
springs
eternal.
they
hope
they
will
get
better.
suddenly,
this
home
is
decertified.
what
does
it
mean
to
them?
they
have
to
go
elsewhere.
will
their
friends
go
with
them
to
these
other
places,
and
where
will
they
go?
no
one
has
the
answer.
imagination,
fear
creeps
into
the
minds
of
these
people.
will
the
next
place
have
windows,
for
instance?
"will
the
nurses
understand
my
problems?"
where
will
it
be?
"another
city
miles
away
from
the
few
visitors
i
have?
what
will
be
the
conditions
there?"
this
is
a
real
fear,
i
submit
to
your
honors.
their
home
has
been
destroyed.
can
the
real
fear
of
transfer
trauma
affect
the
health
of
these
people?
keep
in
the
serious
condition
of
these
people,
as
it
was.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
say
transfer
trauma,
sir,
to
a
large
extent
in
the
case
of
a
seriously
ill
patient,
can
mean
life.
the
shortening
of
that
patient's
life
by
one
day
is
a
deprivation
of
life,
as
far
as
my
argument
goes.
i
think
it
is
also
a
breach
of
liberty
where
the
government,
hew
in
this
case,
has
taken
the
position
which
i
will
argue,
if
i
get
the
opportunity,
that
we're
only
interested
in
the
monetary
moneys
that
we
supply
to
your
state.
we
have
no
interest
in
the
psychic
effects
or
benefits
that
might
accrue
to
these
people
because
of
the
money.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
they
did,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
oh
yes,
sir.
i
say
to
your
honors,
in
the
medical
testimony
even
in
this
case
is
to
the
effect
that
mortality
--
we
had
a
doctor
testifying,
a
psychiatrist
of
note,
if
your
honors
please
--
can
bring
about
many
serious
conditions,
such
as
heart
attacks,
cerebral
hemorrhage,
high
blood
pressure
which
might
bring
on
death
in
an
elderly
person.
so
doctors
say
that
the
patients
will
suffer
as
a
result
of
removal.
if
true,
i
ask
this
court,
haven't
these
patients
bean
deprived
of
not
only
their
property
rights,
the
home
in
which
they
live,
the
only
home
they
know,
but
the
shortening
of
life,
whatever
life
still
remains,
to
them?
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
that
is
right,
sir,
and
that
a
pretermination
hearing
is
their
obligation
to
demonstrate
that.
and
all
i
am
saying
to
this
court,
and
your
honor
has
summed
it
up,
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
case
was
interfered
with.
it
wasn't
complete.
no
appeals
were
taken
by
the
petitioner.
send
it
back
to
the
lower
court,
let
them
complete
the
hearing
that
they
started.
if
they
decide
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
we
don't
belong
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
but
if
they
decide
that
there
was
an
interference
with
these
patients'
rights,
that
it
was
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
and
property,
then
we
may
be
back
here
again.
but
certainly
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
without
the
completion
of
the
testimony
to
demonstrate
that
these
patients
will
be
hurt
and
hurt
badly,
and
that
has
already
been
testified
to
by
dr.
linden,
was
i
noted,
a
psychiatrist
of
32
years'
standing,
who
examined
two
to
three
hundred
of
the
patients
in
this
home,
over
a
period
of
years,
who
felt
that
high
mortality
rate
might
take
place
as
a
result
of
transfer
trauma,
who
felt
that
this
place
was
proper
and
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
these
people.
i
say
that
we
have
a
situation
here
where
hew
says,
"we
don't
have
to
find
these
people
a
home.
we're
only
going
to
put
in
money
to
the
state.
we
have
no
obligation
to
these
people."
and
they
don't,
sir.
the
obligation
is
from
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
for
these
people.
so
when
we
say
to
hew,
"why
don't
you
tell
us
what
kind
of
a
home
you
can
find
for
them,"
they
say
it's
none
of
our
business."
let
your
department
of
health
in
pennsylvania
make
that
decision."
we
go
to
the
department
of
welfare
in
pennsylvania
and
say,
"what
kind
of
a
home
are
you
going
to
send
these
people
to?"
they
say,
"that's
up
to
the
department
of
health."
we
go
to
the
department
of
health
and
they
say
they're
all
right
where
they
are.
"we've
licensed
this
place;
we
think
it's
a
proper
place."
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no,
sir,
the
code
--
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
the
code
provided
--
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
as
stated
by
hew,
is
to
the
effect
that
hearing
shall
be
granted
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
oh,
the
standards?
i
would
assume
that
the
standards
that's
under
19
are
the
same,
almost,
as
the
--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
no,
sir.
eligibility--
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
eligibility
for
medicaide
is
under
the
pennsylvania
statutes,
and
i
would
refer
to
it
if
i
have
enough
time,
sir,
but
it
is
under
the
pennsylvania
act,
the
determination
of
what
is
needy
and
who
is
medically
ill
is
their
determination,
not
hew's
under
title
19.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
the
provider
agreement,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
do
understand
your
question.
i
am
trying
to
find
an
answer
to
you,
sir,
because
you
have
nursing
homes
that
qualify
both
under
18
and
19.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
the
disqualification
of
a
home,
the
decertification
of
a
home,
comes
about
if
there's
a
violation
of
18
and
they
then
say
you're
disqualified
under
both
18
and
19.
we
say
the
patients
are
not
affected
by
that.
they
have
a
right
under
the
pennsylvania
act
to
secure
medical
assistance,
which
includes
nursing
homes.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
and
that's
the
reason
i
hesitate
in
answering
your
question.
gentlemen,
i
think
we
are
toying
with
a
segment
of
society
that
has
bean
neglected.
these
people
don't
know
where
they're
headed.
the
answer
of
hew
is,
"we
give
your
state
money,
so
therefore
we
have
a
right
to
interfere."
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
we
society,
owes
more
to
these
individuals
and
helpless
people.
we
owe
them
an
interest
in
their
welfare.
and
again,
the
regulations,
federal
regulations,
deal
with
the
question
of
welfare
as
far
as
they
are
concerned.
now,
i
have
also
argued
in
my
brief
the
question
of
third
party
rights,
third
party
beneficiary
rights
under
pennsylvania
law.
i
will
not
go
into
it
for
the
purposes
of
time,
if
i
may,
because
the
cases
in
support
of
that
under
pennsylvania
law
are
found
on
page
27
of
my
brief.
other
states
have
held
in
similar
situations
that
these
people
are
third
party
beneficiaries.
i
must
say
to
your
honors
that
any
disruption
of
care,
services
and
treatment
under
the
provider
agreement
is
a
violation
of
the
rights
of
these
people.
mr.
nathan
l.
posner
i
am
so
sorry,
sir.
