mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
skilled
nursing
home
services
are
publicly
funded
under
both
title
18
and
title
19
of
the
social
security
act.
title
18,
commonly
referred
to
as
medicare,
sets
forth
the
standards
and
conditions
which
skilled
nursing
homes
must
meet
whether
or
not
they
participate
in
title
18
or
title
19.
the
standards
are
set
forth
in
title
18.
title
18,
medicare,
is
primarily
administered
by
the
federal
government,
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
title
19,
on
the
other
hand,
is
primarily
administered
by
the
states
that
participate
in
medicaid.
in
this
case,
pennsylvania's
department
of
health
is
the
responsible
agency
for
determining
whether
or
not
title
18
and
title
19
providers
of
skilled
nursing
care
meet
the
conditions
and
standards
which
the
statute
and
regulations
require
of
nursing
homes.
the
federal
role
in
this
process
is
basically
one
of
oversight;
however,
with
respect
to
title
18
providers
in
particular,
the
federal
government
retains
and
often
exercises
the
independent
authority
to
survey
the
facilities
and
make
an
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
they
meet
the
requirements
established
by
congress.
the
survey
function
is
performed
annually
and
generally
involves
a
survey
by
professionals
in
the
field
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
facility
meets
all
of
the
very
specific
conditions
of
participation
in
the
program.
town
court,
the
respondent
facility
in
this
case,
is
a
dual
provider;
that
is,
a
participant
in
both
title
18
and
title
19.
as
such,
the
facility
had
dual
responsibilities
to
both
the
federal
government
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
since
1967
town
court
has
participated
in
this
role
and
has
had
a
checkered
history
with
respect
to
compliance
with
the
statutory
requirements.
from
1967
to
'73,
the
lower
court
acknowledged
that
town
court's
participation
in
the
program
was
basically
conditioned
upon
a
number
of
plans
of
corrections
that
have
been
accepted
by
the
governments
to
allow
them
to
participate.
in
1974
the
state
of
pennsylvania
determined
that
town
court
was
so
substantially
out
of
compliance
that
it
recommended
that
the
facility
be
terminated,
and
it
was.
it
was
readmitted
after
successive
applications
in
1976;
however,
later
that
year
a
grand
jury
was
impaneled
and
returned
indictments
against
the
facility
and
its
management
with
respect
to
care.
that
prompted
the
federal
government
to
conduct
an
independent
survey
of
the
facility,
whereupon
hew
found
substantial
non-compliance
with
the
statutory
requirements
and
requested
pennsylvania
to
conduct
its
own
survey
of
the
facility,
which
was
performed.
after
successive
conferences
and
negotiations
and,
indeed,
surveys
of
the
facility,
pennsylvania
ultimately
recommended
to
the
secretary
of
hew
that
the
facility
be
terminated.
effective
june
20,
1977,
the
facility
was
terminated,
having
been
given
30
days
prior
notice
by
both
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
indeed,
seven
major
conditions
prompted
the
action
by
the
governments.
these
conditions
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
page
295a,
and
the
statutory
references
are
included
there.
but
they
run
the
gamut
from
medical
services
to
administrative
responsibility
being
taken
by
the
facility.
town
court
is
provided
with
a
series
of
administrative
reviews
post-termination,
which
it
began
to
exercise
after
the
action
by
the
governments.
however,
before
those
procedures
could
be
exhausted,
this
action
was
instituted.
town
court
joined
by
six
individual
residents
of
the
facility
sued
both
the
secretary
of
hew
and
the
secretary
of
the
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare,
charging
that
it
was
a
violation
of
its,
the
facility's,
due
process
rights
and
its
patients'
due
process
rights
for
the
facility
to
be
terminated
without
prior
notice
and
hearing;
indeed
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
be
provided
to
the
facility
and
independently
to
the
patients.
after
several
hearings
the
district
court
ruled
against
town
court
and
against
the
patients,
finding
that
the
statutory
procedures
were
sufficient
for
the
facility
and
that
the
patients
were
entitled
to
no
pre-termination
hearings.
the
patients
and
the
facility
appealed.
the
secretary
of
hew
cross-appealed
because
the
district
court
also
ordered
that
the
governments
continue
to
make
medicare
and
medicaid
payments
to
town
court.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
view
taken
by
my
client's
predecessor
was,
with
respect
to
the
funding
order,
which
was
the
only
adverse
order,
that
our
fate
rested
with
the
federal
government.
if
the
federal
government
was
successful
on
its
appeal,
rightly
or
wrongly,
my
client's
predecessor
assumed
that
its
obligation
would
also
fall
by
the
wayside.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
took
issue
with
that
and
that's
a
question,
i
think,
that
is
really
not
pertinent
to
the
merits.
on
the
merits
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
we
have
addressed
that
question
in
our
reply
brief,
the
solicitor
general
has
addressed
it
in
both
his
reply
and
opening
briefs,
and
briefly,
it's
our
position
that
the
arguments
which
are
being
advanced
here
on
the
merits
were
advanced
properly
to
the
court
of
appeals,
were
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals;
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
it
was
deciding
the
case
on
behalf
or
against
both
pennsylvania
and
the
united
states.
pennsylvania
as
an
appellee
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
primary
importance
is
clearly,
under
our
view,
entitled
to
seek
review
of
an
adverse
ruling,
which
she
suffered
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
court.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
it's
a
little
confusing.
the
ruling
on
the
merits
was
against
both
the
united
states
and
pennsylvania,
basically
holding
that
the
patients
had
a
due
process
right.
it
would
seem
to
follow
than
that
the
funding
order
would
have
to
be
reversed
but
my
reading
of
the
opinion
indicates
that
the
funding
order
was
not
reversed,
and
i
think
it's
somewhat
inconsistent.
we
pointed
that
out.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
technically,
the
united
states
is
a
respondent;
however,
they
have
filed
briefs
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
precedents
in
that
area
and
decided
that
town
court
had
sufficient
protections
post-review
that
were
granted
by
the
statute.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
town
court
did
not
seek
certiorari.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
town
court
is
here
technically
as
a
respondent,
i
would
assume,
inasmuch
as
they
were
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
they
are
not
here
seeking
any
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
cross
appeals
and
issued
two
en
banc
decisions.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
they
have
filed
nothing.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yes,
they
took
a
position
in
support
of
the
patients,
but
the
primary
thrust
of
their
assertion,
and
they
were
independently
represented,
was
that
town
court
itself
had
this
right.
thus
if
they
were
successful,
the
patients'
interests
were
really
of
no
consequence
to
them.
but
they
did
not
seek
review
of
the
adverse
ruling
that
they
suffered
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
issued
two
opinions,
first
as
i
mentioned,
ruling
that
town
court
was
adequately
protected
by
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
regulations.
the
second,
departing,
in
my
view,
from
at
least
two
other
circuit
courts,
held
that
the
patients,
contrary
to
the
facility,
were
entitled
to
pre-termination
--
and
when
i
refer
to
termination,
i
mean
termination
of
the
facility
--
pre-termination
evidentiary
hearing.
the
court's
rationale
is
not
found
in
the
opinion
but
rather
in
a
companion
case
decided
the
same
say,
klein
v.
califano.
in
that
opinion,
the
court
recognized,
indeed
acknowledged
and
conceded,
that
title
19
does
not
specifically
guarantee
--
or
title
18,
for
that
matter
--
does
not
specifically
guarantee
any
rights
to
the
patients,
or
indeed
any
role
for
the
patients
in
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
nursing
home
provider
is
qualified
under
the
program.
however,
the
court
looked
to
three
distinct
provisions
and
inferred
from
those
provisions
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
in
view
of
the
grave
consequences
that
it
perceived
in
the
decision
to
terminate
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
so
as
to
protect
this,
quote,
"property
interest,".
further
articulation
of
this
position
was
given
by
judge
adams
in
his
concurring
opinion
which
may
well
be,
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case,
because
it
was
joined
in
by
two
members
of
the
majority.
but
judge
adams
further
expounded
on
this
and
noted
that
because
of
the
prevalence
of
social
welfare
programs
in
today's
society
and
because
of
these
provisions
in
the
statute,
which
i
will
get
to,
he
perceived
a
landscape
with
three
distinct
points
on
it
that
created
a
property
interest,
indeed,
quote,
"a
new
type
of
property
interest,"
unquote,
that
we
all
should
be
alert
to.
with
these
rationales
in
hand
the
court
of
appeals
then
determined
that
the
patients
were
indeed
entitled
to
a
pre-termination
evidentiary
hearing.
as
we
point
out,
each
of
these
provisions
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
question
and
provides
no
basis
for
the
ruling.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
recipients
of
skilled
nursing
home
care
are
only
entitled
to
receive
skilled
nursing
home
care
from
a
qualified
skilled
nursing
home.
indeed,
if
a
nursing
home
does
not
meet
the
conditions
of
participation,
it's
not
a
skilled
nursing
home
under
title
19
and
18.
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked
this
and
found
that
the
freedom
of
choice
provision
and
the
transfer
limitations
all
created
an
aura
of
property.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
for
the
judiciary
to
lightly
overlook
the
clear
intent
of
congress
that
the
relationships
between
the
patients
and
the
government
and
the
contractors
and
the
government
be
distinct.
the
relationship
between
the
contractor
and
the
government
is
one
which
is
specifically
detailed
in
the
statute
and
does
not
encompass
any
role
whatsoever
for
the
patients
in
determining
the
eligibility
of
the
contractor.
similarly,
the
contractor
has
no
role
in
determining
the
eligibility
of
the
patients,
and
that
is
the
way
congress
envisioned
it.
as
judge
friendly
said,
common
sense
suggests
that
there
must
be
some
floor
below
which
no
hearing
of
any
sort
is
required,
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
dipped
below
that
floor
in
failing
to
recognized
that
the
entire
thrust
of
title
19
depends
upon
the
qualifications
of
both
the
provider
and
the
recipient,
and
here
the
court
of
appeals
is
granting
a
recipient
a
role
in
determining
the
qualifications
of
a
provider,
which
congress
never
envisioned.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
several
matters
i
would
like
to
address.
first,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
properly
here.
respondent
makes
apparently
two
claims
in
that
regard.
the
first
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
order
that
his
proceedings
in
the
district
court
were
interrupted.
i
assume
he
is
suggesting
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
not
appealable.
he
failed
to
point
out
that
he
appealed
from
that
order,
and
it
is
indeed
that
appeal
that
brings
the
petitioner
to
this
court,
because
as
we
have
pointed
out,
we
participated
as
appellee
in
the
court
of
appeals,
responding
to
his
appeal
on
the
issue
of
primary
importance,
that
being
the
patients'
due
process
rights.
secondly,
he
concedes
that
if
hew
is
properly
here,
then
of
course
plenary
review
may
be
granted
over
the
question
presented
in
the
certiorari
petition,
but
he
argues
that
hew
is
not
properly
here
because
they
never
sued
hew
on
this
issue.
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
complaint.
the
prayer
for
relief
very
specifically
runs
against
both
hew
and
pennsylvania,
and
well
it
should,
because
hew
provides
over
half
of
the
funding
for
the
medicaide
patients
which
my
learned
opponent
is
representing.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
order
against
pennsylvania
and
hew
is
that
medicaide
funding
be
continued
until
the
patients
are
relocated.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
against
the
state
and
hew.
indeed,
it
would
have
to
be
against
hew
because,
as
i
said,
they
provide
over
half
of
the
funds
that
are
involved.
so
that
the
fact
that
there
are
no
medicare
patients
is
of
little
consequence,
and
is
easily
explained
--
easily
explains
why
hew
was
sued
by
these
medicaide
patients,
because
hew
has
an
extremely
large
role
in
the
administration
of
medicaide,
and
without
them
as
a
defendant
here,
the
relief
could
not
have
been
complete.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
mr.
justice
white.
my
opponent
asserts
in
the
alternative
that
his
claim
is
predicated
only
upon
state
law,
a
contract
theory
which
we
have
addressed
in
the
briefs,
and
state
law,
which
he
has
not
pointed
out
here.
he
has
yet
to
point
to
a
provision
in
pennsylvania
law
that
requires
a
hearing
for
these
patients
before
their
medicaide
certification
--
before
the
nursing
home
certification
is
terminated.
in
fact
there
is
none.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
what
i
assumed
he
was
arguing
until
this
morning,
when
i
believe
that
he
argued
that
it
was
net
federal
law
that
he
was
concerned
about;
he
was
concerned
about
provisions
of
state
law
which,
if
they
existed,
of
course,
would
be
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
he
has
pointed
to
none;
there
are
none.
we
have
supplied
the
court
with
a
copy
of
the
precise
contract
which
was
utilized
between
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
town
court
nursing
center
which
in
the
clearest
of
terms
points
out
that
the
contract
is
terminable
forthwith
should
the
facility
fall
out
of
compliance
with
federal
and
state
regulations
governing
the
operation
of
such
facilities.
finally,
i
should
point
out
that
throughout
the
proceedings,
the
state
law
questions
never
surface
from
the
respondents,
never
have
the
patients
asserted
that
pennsylvania
was
breaching
its
own
law
by
terminating
the
facility,
and
indeed,
the
first
mention
of
any
such,
the
first
allusion
to
this
is
in
this
court,
and
as
i
pointed
out,
no
specific
provisions
were
pointed
out.
indeed,
they
couldn't
be
because
they
don't
exist.
thank
you.
