we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
o'bannon
v.
town
court
nursing
center.
mr.
watkins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
that
it
would
be
completed
before
the
end
of
this
present
term
of
the
court,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
posner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
you
represent
the
patients,
i
take
it
you
mean
by
that
you
represent
each
individual
of
the
190
more
or
less
patients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
this
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
a
certification
or
is
there
a
motion
pending
to
certify
class?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there,
mr.
posner,
any
possibility
of
incompatibility
between
the
rights
of
the
patients
and
the
rights
of
the
nursing
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
authorities
in
pennsylvania
have
a
legal
obligation
under
their
statute
to
tell
them
where
to
go?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
these
patients
who
are
now
in
the
home
select
this
home,
or
were
they
mandated
there
by
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
to
prevent,
preclude,
or
hinder
the
home
from
calling,
one
at
a
time,
every
one
of
the
patients
as
a
witness
in
the
proceeding
to
disqualify
the
home?
would
that
not
accomplish
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
nursing
home
did
have
a
hearing,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
hearing
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
going
back
to
this
hearing,
the
post
hearing,
what
was
to
prevent
in
that
hearing
from
having
every
one
of
the
patients
in
the
home
come
in
and
take
part
in
it
in
the
sense
of
justifying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
do
you
say
is
responsible
for
not
having
completed
that
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
possible
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
department
of
health
and
welfare
has
an
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
adequate
care
is
provided
that
will
not
bring
on
any
of
this
train
of
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
posner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
rebuttal?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understand
his
argument.
his
point
is
that
the
failure
of
--
any
failure
to
provide
for
a
hearing
for
the
patients
is
the
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
that's
what
i
thought
he
was
arguing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
