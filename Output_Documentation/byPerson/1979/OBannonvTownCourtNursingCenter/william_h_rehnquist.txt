justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
town
court?
did
the
court
of
appeals
grant
the
institution
any
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
town
court
didn't
petition
this
court
for
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
months
after
it
began,
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
hasn't
begun
yet?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
right
and
a
defendant
were
convicted
of
a
crime
and
incarcerated
but
decided
not
to
appeal,
a
second
cousin
whom
he'd
been
sending
$30
a
month
to
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
his
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
represent
both
town
court
and
the
patients?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
do
you
reprint
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
incompatibility
really
between
the
position
of
hew
and
the
present
position
of
the
secretary
of
the
commonwealth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
their
interests
basically
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
--
the
third
circuit
really
had
presented
to
it
all
the
arguments
by
hew
that
this
court
is
now
being
presented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
any
doubt,
do
you,
that
it's
none
of
our
business
how
pennsylvania
construes
its
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
meant,
the
law--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
are
saying
any
time
that
this
court
thinks
that
any
state
has
construed
a
state
statute
pertaining
to
contracts,
torts
or
anything
else
contrary
to
the
way
that
statute
should
have
been
construed,
it
raises
a
fourteenth
amendment
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
of
pennsylvania
had
a
statute
of
limitations
provision
applying
a
two-year
statute
to
a
certain
type
of
cause
of
action.
the
pennsylvania
court
said
that
statute
applied
in
a
particular
case.
could
you
bring
that
case
here
on
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
saying
that
under
the
--
that
pennsylvania
had
misapplied
its
statute
of
limitations
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
claim
of
a
widow
who
has
missed
a
substantial
negligence
recovery
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
bar?
isn't
that
a
fairly
serious
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
violating
its
own
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
a
jump
to
a
conclusion,
so
far
as
i
can
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
transfer
trauma
come,
is
it
life,
is
it
liberty,
or
is
it
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
had
a
property
interest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
you
have
life,
liberty,
and
property?
