mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
watkins
has
discussed
the
scope
of
the
medicaid
statutes
and
regulations,
and
we
agree
with
that
discussion,
so
our
briefs
reflect.
i
would
like
this
morning,
if
i
may,
to
focus
not
so
much
on
the
statutes
and
regulations
as
on
the
constitutional
principles
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
reflect,
because
although
it's
not
entirely
clear
from
the
court's
various
opinions,
its
decision
in
this
case
seems
to
be
based
not
so
much
on
a
misreading
of
what
the
statutes
and
regulations
provide
as
upon
what
we
contend
is
a
basic
misunderstanding
of
what
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
my
understanding
is,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
it
is
still
under
active
consideration,
and
when
i
last
checked,
which
was
last
week,
they
still
intend
to
institute
rulemaking.
exactly
when
is
something
i
can't
say.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
the
rulemaker
would
provide
with
respect
to
type
of
patient
participation
in
this
case.
as
we
stated
in
our
reply
brief,
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
issues
are
very
important
because
we
think
a
rulemaker
should
be
free
to
consider
the
various
policy
considerations
on
both
sides,
free
from
a
judicial
decree
based
on
an
erroneous
view
of
its
constitutional
obligation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
as
yet.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
be
in
my
view
unlikely
to
be
completed
before
this
court
reached
a
decision
on
the
question.
that's
my
speculation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
months,
i
would
say.
it
would
be
an
extended
notice
in
comment
rulemaking,
with
whatever
judicial
review
followed
from
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i'm
only
speculating,
but
this
is
a
question
of
considerable
importance.
it
would
concern
the
interests
of
nursing
homes
throughout
the
nation.
i
presume
that
there
would
be
substantial
comments
on
whatever
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
went
out.
the
agency
would
have
to
digest
these,
the
arguments,
finally
the
agency
would
come
out
with
a
proposed
rule,
and
in
my
experience
these
things
are
not
done
in
two
months
or
so.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
has
not.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
really
--
my
guess
is
as
good
as
yours,
your
honor.
my
guess
is
that
it's
doubtful.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct;
that's
correct.
despite
the
considerable
complexities
of
the
medicaid
and
medicare
statutes
and
regulations,
the
significant
facts
in
this
case
are
fairly
simple.
the
statute
provides
eligible
patients
with
a
right
to
receive
certain
kinds
of
medical
care
from
qualified
providers
like
nursing
homes,
that
is,
providers
that
the
secretary
of
hew
or
appropriate
state
officials
have
determined
meet
the
statutory
standards
and
requirements.
if
a
home
is
found
to
be
qualified,
hew
or
the
appropriate
state
agency
enters
into
an
agreement
with
the
home
and
the
agencies,
those
agencies
directly
pay
the
home
for
services
that
the
home
provides
to
eligible
patients.
in
this
case,
hew
determined
that
town
court
nursing
center
was
not
a
qualified
provider
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
accordingly
petitioner's
predecessor
attempted
to
terminate
the
home's
participation,
terminate
the
home's
medicaid
agreement
with
petitioner's
predecessor
as
hew
regulations
required
him
to
do.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
decision
to
terminate
the
home
would
not
affect
the
rights
of
any
patient
to
receive
qualified
care
under
the
statute
from
any
other
home
found
to
be
qualified.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe
it
was;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
the
extent
of
alternative
space
at
the
time
this
matter
was
before
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
was
not
in
a
small
town.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
there
are
other
nursing
homes
in
philadelphia,
very
definitely.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe
the
home
has
some
190
patients,
90
percent
of
whom
are
medicaid
patients.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
practical
effect,
it
would
mean
that
if
the
home
were
terminated,
the
patients
would
have
to
find
another
qualified
nursing
home
in
order
to
receive
benefits
under
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
state
and
hew
have
services
intended
--
and
do
--
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
a
very
effective
service
to
assist
patients
to
relocate
to
other
homes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
190?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
don't
know
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
philadelphia;
yes,
sir.
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
substance
was
that
because
the
decision
to
terminate
a
nursing
home
in
the
program
has
a
significant
effect
on
the
patients'
exercise
of
their
statutory
rights,
the
decision
therefore
constituted
in
some
way
a
deprivation
of
the
patients'
statutory
rights
and
there-for
a
deprivation
of
their
property
interests.
accordingly
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
patients
have
a
right
under
the
due
process
clause
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
the
decision
to
terminate
the
home.
it's
our
basic
submission
that
this
theory
of
the
due
process
clause
is
incorrect.
it
would
mean
that
government
agencies
would
have
to
provide
notice
and
hearings
in
an
almost
infinite
number
of
situations
in
which
governmental
action
affects
the
exercise
of
people's
statutory
or
constitutional
rights.
to
take
the
theory
to
its
logical
conclusion,
it
would
mean
that
if
the
government
cancelled
a
defense
contract,
it
would
have
to
provide
hearings
to
all
of
the
defense
contractor's
employees
who
might
be
affected
by
that
decision.
to
take
an
example
that's
perhaps
more
pertinent
in
this
context,
suppose
that
a
state
medical
licensing
board
sought
to
delicense
a
doctor
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
professionally
incompetent.
under
the
court
of
appeals
theory,
not
only
the
doctor
but
all
of
his
medicaid
patients
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
the
doctor's
qualifications.
these
and
other
examples,
we
submit,
are
no
different
in
principle
from
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
respondent
patients
have
not
responded,
at
least
in
their
briefs,
to
the
obvious
implication
of
their
position
to
innumerable
other
governmental
decisions
on
in
an
alix
context.
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
have
far-reaching
implications,
of
course,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
was
incorrect.
indeed,
this
court
has
never
directly
faced
the
kind
of
claim
of
derivative
constitutional
rights
that
the
patients
are
asserting
in
this
case.
our
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
is
based
on
the
basic
proposition
that
this
court's
decisions
reflect,
that
the
procedural
protections
of
the
due
process
clause
must
be
confined
by
some
limiting
principles,
that
government
could
hardly
function
if
it
had
to
provide
notice
and
evidentiary
hearings
to
all
persons
affected
by
governmental
action.
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
the
relevant
question
concerns
the
nature
and
not
the
weight
of
the
interest
that
is
affected.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
in
considering
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
is
affected,
courts
must
also
identify
whose
rights
are
being
affected,
whose
rights
are
being
primarily
affected
by
the
governmental
action.
in
this
case,
the
termination
decision
is
directed
primarily
against
the
nursing
home,
and
no
one
disputes
that
the
nursing
home
has
a
statutory
right
and
a
constitutional
property
interest
that
is
affected,
and
therefore
a
right
to
some
kind
of
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
the
merits
of
the
decision.
it
is
our
submission
that
so
long
as
the
person
whose
rights
are
primarily
affected
by
governmental
action
is
given
an
opportunity
to
contest
that
action
and
a
notice
of
the
action,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
hearings
on
the
same
decision
for
other
persons
whose
rights
are
indirectly
affected
by
that
action.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
our
submission,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
the
logical
implications
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
now,
at
this
point
it
might
be
asked,
"well,
apart
from
the
logical
implications
of
the
decision,
what
is
the
harm
in
giving
patients
some
opportunity
be
heard
in
this
matter?"
well,
the
harm
is
this.
let
us
assume,
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
a
particular
nursing
home
is
in
substantial
noncompliance
with
the
statutory
standards
and
requirements,
and
thus
poses
a
genuine
threat
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
patients.
the
most
effective
sanction
that
the
regulatory
agencies
have
for
either
inducing
compliance
by
the
home
or
for
protecting
the
patients
is
to
terminate
the
home's
participation
in
the
program.
if
agencies
could
not
exercise
their
right
until
they
gave
hearings
to
all
of
the
patients
in
the
home,
the
effectiveness
of
that
sanction
would
be
largely
nullified.
the
credibility
of
the
sanction
would
largely
evaporate.
i
cannot
put
it
better
than
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
9th
circuit
in
rejecting
a
similar
claim
with
respect
to
a
claim
by
patients
of
a
veterans
hospital
in
a
case
we
discussed
in
our
brief
moore
v.
johnson
-
referring
to
the
impact
of
the
decision
on
patients
of
a
decision
to
close
certain
facilities,
the
court
said
"similar
burdens
always
attend
the
extensive
distribution
of
benefits
by
government.
inescapably,
few
get
exactly
what
they
want
while
most,
it
is
usually
assumed,
get
more
than
what
they
would
have
otherwise.
all
would
get
less
if
invariably
the
complaints
of
the
many
required
elaborate
hearings
with
all
the
trappings
that
only
lawyers
and
judges
can
fully
appreciate."
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
by
the
petitioner.
