mr.
andrew
j.
levander
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiries,
i
think,
that
the
government
has
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
the
proceedings
here
that
the
petitioner
has
alleged
that
his
conviction
was
invalid
under
gideon
against
wainwright.
if
the
court
accepts
either
petitioner's
statutory
or
constitutional
claim
and
objects
the
government's
arguments
then
the
appropriate
remedy,
i
think,
both
petitioner
and
respondent
agree
would
be
remand
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
prior
conviction
was
void
under
gideon
against
wainwright.
as
i
understand
his
proffer,
the
record
of
the
conviction
does
not
affirmatively
show
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
did
not
have
counsel
at
--
at
the
time
of
his
1961
conviction.
rather
the
--
i
believe
that
the
florida
lawyer
indicated
to
mr.
wood
that
the
record
or
transcript
of
--
of
the
proceedings
did
indicate
that
he
was
without
counsel.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
agree.
that
he
alleges
that
--
that
the
florida
lawyer
told
him
that
the
transcript
indicated
affirmatively
that
mr.
--
the
petitioner
was
without
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
prior
conviction.
we've
never
had
an
opportunity
to
explore
that
as
a
matter
of
proceedings
because
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
correctly
in
our
view
said
that
whether
or
not
he
was
without
to
counsel
at
his
1961
conviction
is
irrelevant.
he
was
convicted
in
1961
and
he
never
overturned
that
conviction.
he
never
obtained
a
pardon
and
he
never
pursued
his
administrative
remedies
under
the
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
when
he
--
i
think
what
happened
was
that
he
asked
for
a
continuance
so
he
could
find
out
more
fully
what
the
actual
facts
were.
and
the
judge
said,
"well,
there's
no
need
for
a
continuance
because
it's
irrelevant,"
which
is
our
point.
and
he
started
to
say
--
petitioner
was
convicted
in
1961
in
a
florida
state
court
of
a
felony.
that
conviction
has
never
been
overturned
and
he
has
never
obtained
a
pardon
and
he
has
never
pursued
his
administrative
remedied
under
the
act.
nonetheless,
he
claims
that
the
act
should
be
construed
to
permit
him
to
attack
the
validity
of
his
prior
conviction
for
the
first
time
in
his
federal
gun
law
prosecution.
alternatively,
he
claims
that
if
the
act
does
not
provide
such
a
defense
that
the
constitution
requires
it
at
least
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
prior
conviction
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
in
our
view,
the
language
and
structure
of
the
act
refutes
petitioner's
statutory
claim.
the
act
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
from
the
record,
i
understand
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case,
mr.
wood
put
petitioner
on
the
stand
and
that
he
said,
"now,
judge
i
would
let
him
--
want
him
to
testify
about
the
prior
conviction
and
my
--
and
his
lack
of
counsel
and
the
judge
said,
"well,
but
we've
already
gone
through
this.”
he
said,
“i
agree.
i
just
want
to
make
my
objection
that
--
that
he
would
testify."
and
the
judge
said
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct
also.
that's
how
i
understand
it.
i
think
that
the
--
the
transcript
as
far
as
i
--
i
know
is
the
partially
printed
in
the
appendix
and
if
the
court
needs
a
formal
transcript,
we
can
obtain
one.
as
i
start
to
say,
the
act
unequivocally
and
broadly
declares
that
any
person
who
was
convicted
of
a
felony
may
not
receive,
posses,
or
transport
a
firearm.
the
plain
meaning
of
that
sweeping
language
is
that
any
person
who
has
an
outstanding
conviction,
particularly
one
such
as
petitioner
who
served
four
years
for
that
conviction
is
barred
from
possessing
a
firearm.
no
exception
appears
in
the
language
for
a
prior
conviction
that
it's
invalid
or
a
prior
conviction
that's
invalid
because
of
gideon
against
wainwright
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
point
out
a
couple
of
things.
first,
of
course
in
this
case
the
petitioner
was
not
going
to
become
a
guard
at
an
institution.
he
was
arrested
for
having
a
concealed
weapon
on
his
person
as
he
was
about
to
enter
an
illegal
gambling
casino.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
act
gives
the
defendant
who
was
been
convicted
and
think
he's
either
being
convicted
unfairly
or
who
thinks
that
his
conviction
is
not
indicative
of
his
propensity
to
misuse
firearms,
three
alternatives
before
going
out
and
possessing
the
firearm.
first,
he
can
collaterally
attack
his
conviction
in
the
appropriate
court.
here,
he
should
have
gone
back
to
florida
state
court
where
they
are
familiar
with
florida
law
and
florida
proceedings
and
florida
records
and
not
raise
it
for
the
first
time
in
a
federal
court
after
going
out
in
possessing
the
firearm.
second,
he
could
obtain
a
qualifying
pardon
under
section
1203
of
the
act.
the
pardon
must
state
specifically,
not
only
that
his
pardoned
but
that
he's
pardoned
and
can
use
firearms
or
can
posses
firearms.
third,
failing
--
the
ability
to
overturn
the
conviction
for
one
reason
or
another
or
get
a
pardon.
the
convicted
person
has
the
alternative
under
section
925
(c)
of
the
act
to
petition
the
secretary
of
treasury
for
dispensation.
this
is
not
a
meaningless
procedure.
in
the
year
1978,
some
1700
and
54
applications
were
made
by
convicted
felons
for
dispensation.
and
of
those,
something
like
574
were
actually
granted.
and
so,
this
is
a
real
procedure
which
is
followed
by
many
people
who
are
apprehensive
about
their
prior
conviction.
now
--
so
far,
there's
no
exception
in
the
act,
there's
no
defense
in
the
act
regarding
the
validity
of
the
prior
conviction
and
such
a
defense
would
similarly
be
reconcilable
with
congress'
decision
to
impose
a
similar
firearm
disability
on
persons
under
indictment.
if
--
if
a
person
--
if
petitioner
is
correct
by
the
statutory
construction
of
the
act
then
he
would
attribute
to
congress
the
following
purpose.
the
person
who
was
convicted,
albeit
without
counsel,
obviously
has
already
been
indicted
yet
even
though
he
was
indicted
and
a
jury
or
judge
has
found
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
albeit
without
counsel,
he
would
be
deemed
more
trustworthy
than
a
person
who's
merely
under
indictment.
yet,
a
person
whose
conviction
is
overturned
for
lack
of
counsel
is
not
scot-free,
he
is
still
under
indictment.
it's
simply
irreconcilable
with
--
with
the
congressional
language
to
the
construe
the
act
to
permit
a
validity
defense.
we
think
the
absence
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that's
not
exactly
true,
your
honor.
the
language
--
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
--
that
there's
a
lot
more
discussion
about
the
parallel
provisions
in
section
922
and
those
were
enacted
the
same
time
and
use
the
exact
same
language,
has
been
convicted.
and
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole
shows
a
--
a
clear
congressional
purpose
to
broadly
reach
out
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
scarborough,
in
barrett,
in
huddleston,
and
in
bass,
a
broad
purpose
of
congress
to
limit
the
flow
of
firearms
to
persons
who
might
potentially
be
dangerous
to
society.
and
certainly,
petitioner
fits
into
that
category.
and
it's
particularly
reflective
of
congressional
intent
that
there
is
no
specific
validity
defense
because
first
all,
there
are
exceptions
and
defenses
contained
within
the
act,
express
ones
but
not
--
not
the
one
sought
by
petitioner.
moreover,
where
congress
has
thought
it
appropriate
to
allow
defendants
to
challenge
prior
convictions
it
has
so
provided.
for
example,
in
the
special
dangerous
offender
statute
which
is
found
at
18
u.s.c.
3575
(e),
congress
has
specifically
provided
the
defense
sought
by
petitioner
here.
interestingly
--
and
not
provide
in
this
act,
interestingly,
the
special
dangers
offender
statute
was
enacted
as
title
x
of
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970.
title
xi
of
that
very
same
act
is
an
explosive
control
statute
which
in
haec
verba
adopts
the
gun
control
provisions
and
yet
in
that
title
xi,
no
special
defense
is
made,
the
defense
of
the
--
a
validity
that
is
sought
by
petitioner.
so
it's
therefore
clear
that
congress
knows
how
to
create
such
a
--
a
defense
or
exception
when
it
wants
to
and
it
purposely
did
not
here.
and
that's
quite
understandable
given
the
general
thrust
of
the
act
which
is
that
persons
who
by
their
prior
acts
or
characteristics
have
indicated
they
might
be
dangerous,
should
clear
their
name
first
before
going
out
in
possessing
a
firearm,
it's
a
clear
bright
line
rule.
petitioner's
construction
of
the
act
would
encourage
defendants
and
people
who
have
been
convicted
to
simply
guess
whether
or
not
they
think
that
their
prior
conviction
is
valid.
that
would
certainly
narrow
the
ambit
of
the
act
and
would
also
tend
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
congress,
which
was
to
make
sure
that
people
who
are
running
around
with
firearms
or
getting
firearms
are
to
be
trusted.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
congress
has
sweepingly
created
these
categories
of
persons
and
a
convicted
person
has
various
options
to
show
that
he
doesn't
belong
in
that
category.
one
of
them
is
simply
not
to
go
out
and
buy
a
firearm
and
ignore
the
fact
of
his
conviction.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
under
indictment
part
would
apply
presumably
he
would
go
into
court
and
simply
have
it
dismissed
for
failure
to
prosecute
under
the
speedy
trial
act
of
something
of
that
nature
or
the
speedy
trial
for
the
constitution.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
has
done
nothing.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
would've
violated
the
act
under
922
(g)
or
(h)
if
--
if
the
receipt
of
transportation
can
be
shown
under
the
statutory
language,
under
indictment
is
under
indictment,
convicted
means
convicted.
we
think
that
the
--
basically,
that
the
thrust
of
a
petitioners
argument
is
this
constitutional
claims
based
on
a
burgett
line
of
cases.
before
turning
to
that
though,
i
think
that
--
that
in
our
view
this
is
really
a
due
process
case
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
to
keep
firearms
out
of
hands
of
persons
that
they
think
have
exhibited
characteristics
which
might
suggest
that
they
may
misuse
the
firearms
until
such
time
as
they'd
cleared
their
name.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
if
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
--
well,
let
me
try
to
explain.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
if
--
if
congress
could
pass
an
act,
if
congress
is
constitutionally
empowered
to
say
people
under
indictment
may
not
possess
a
firearm
and
that's
valid.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
then
it
cannot
be
for
--
or
it
would
be
completely
illogical
for
the
sixth
amendment
to
acquire
that
persons
who
how
have
now
only
be
indicted
but
have
been
convicted
and
have
not
done
something
about
that
conviction
cannot
(inaudible)
possess
of
firearm,
you
ignore
the
fact
of
their
conviction.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
i
think
he
makes
both
arguments.
i
think
that
--
that
as
i
try
to
--
to
demonstrate
in
my
last
few
minutes
that
all
of
the
indicia
of
congressional
intent,
the
sweeping
language,
the
legislative
history,
the
policy
and
the
express
exemptions
and
other
acts
show
that
--
what
congress
intended
to
do.
he
not
only
claims
that
congress
did
intend
to
do
it
but
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
under
--
and
as
to
that
point
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
think
probably
that
the
court
might
have
decided
under
--
due
process
principles.
i
mean
the
use
of
so
many
--
a
collateral
and
perhaps
prejudicial
convictions
was
simply
a
violation
of
due
process
as
opposed
to
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
once
the
prior
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
--
first
of
all
as
of
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
as
the
chief
justice
point
out,
once
a
persons
conviction
has
been
overturned,
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
vacated
and
so
therefore
he
is
no
longer
a
convicted
felon.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
think
that
would
be
an
overly
literal
interpretation
of
the
language
which
would
work.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
we
--
we
say
if
someone
who
has
an
outstanding
conviction.
the
--
the
language
that
you
would
had
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
other
language
would
be
more
appropriate
if
congress
said,
who
has
ever
been
convicted
regardless
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
then
it
would
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
existence
in
the
statute
of
a
pardon
procedure
and
administrator
procedure
for
people
who
have
outstanding
convictions
strongly
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
convicted
meant
an
outstanding
conviction.
person
who's
had
their
conviction
overturned
certainly
doesn't
need
a
pardon.
and
--
and
if
you
went
through
a
governor
of
the
state
of
florida
and
said,
i've
had
my
conviction
overturned
by
want
to
pardon,
he
would
say,
you're
crazy.
he
would
not
--
that
would
not
be
a
normal
procedure
i
don't
think.
and
i
think
that
the
normal
plain
meaning
of
the
language
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
is
someone
who
has
an
outstanding
conviction.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it's
presumptively
valid
under
johnson
against
zerbst
until
such
time
as
it's
been
overturned.
and
--
and
certainly,
a
petitioner
who
served
for
years
for
his
crime,
in
florida
in
1961,
knew
that
he
had
been
convicted.
i
started
to
say
that
if
the
general
classification
of
the
statute
is
a
irrational
one
and
into
a
limited
--
a
civil
disability
regarding
firearms
that
it's
been
posed
by
congress
validly
as
to
all
people
who
have
outstanding
convictions
then
it
follows
that
congress
could
impose
a
criminal
penalty
on
someone
who
ignored
the
fact
of
that
conviction
and
failed
to
pursue
his
administrative
or
judicial
remedies
to
overturn
that
conviction
prior
to
possessing
the
firearm.
as
this
court
stated
in
yakus
against
united
states
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
444
of
volume
321.
there
is,
“no
principle
of
law
or
provision
of
the
constitution
which
precludes
congress
for
making
criminal,
the
violation
of
an
administrative
regulation
by
one
who
has
failed
to
avail
himself
of
an
adequate
separate
procedure
for
the
adjudication
of
its
validity.”
so
therefore,
if
the
classification
is
valid
and
we
submit
that
it
is,
we
submit
that
it's
valid
for
several
reasons,
then
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
penalty
by
one
who
ignores
the
fact
of
his
conviction
and
fails
to
avail
himself
of
the
adequate
procedures
that
have
been
supplied
by
congress
will
--
then
there's
no
questions
as
constitutionality
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
in
united
states
against
liles,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
they
held
that
both
the
act
applies
to
someone
who
has
an
outstanding
conviction
on
appeal
and
that
there's
no
constitutional
impediment
to
convicting
him.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
agree
with
that.
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
no
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
if
--
if
he's
been
convicted,
it's
congress'
judgment
that
he
should
clear
his
name
first.
i
mean,
he
could
send
--
simply
send
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
saying,
“gee,
i
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
1800
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
1800
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
certainly
is
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
1800
felons
knew
last
year
to
send
applications
to
the
secretary
of
treasury.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
they
--
they
certainly
are
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
absolutely
correct.
we
think
that
the
congress
knowing
that
there
was
a
tremendous
and
precipitous
rise
in
violence
and
particularly
that
violence
was
connected
to
gun
possession
by
people
with
criminal
records
or
characteristics
that
it
was
entitled
to
broadly
provide
that
anyone
who
has
been
convicted
whether
or
not
the
conviction
maybe
subject
to
collateral
attack,
they
cannot
a
possess
a
firearm
until
such
time
as
they
clear
their
name.
it's
particularly
constitutional
and
meets
the
equal
protection
analysis
challenges
because
925
(c)
makes
sure
that
the
statute
is
individually
tailored.
someone
who
thinks
that
their
conviction
is
not
indicative
of
their
propensity
to
misuse
firearms
can
go
in
and
apply
to
the
secretary
for
dispensation.
moreover,
and
we
submit
that
even
by
focusing
on
the
subclass
of
person's
whose
convictions
are
possibly
subject
to
a
collateral
attack,
that
that
statute
is
still
irrational.
certainly,
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
even
without
counsel
has
been
both
indicted
and
found
guilty
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
and
that
those
facts
differentiate
him
from
the
populace
at
large.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
still
violates
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
crucial
determination
is
that
he
must
clear
his
name
before
possessing
the
firearm.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
if
he
cleared
his
name
--
once
he
clears
his
name
either
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
say
that
--
say
that
again,
the
coram
nobis
proceeding,
is
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
then,
he's
--
once
he
has
overturned
his
conviction
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
a
state
his
appealing,
then
he
is
still
under
indictment
under
section
922.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
then
he
can't
go
out
and
receive
or
transport
a
firearm
if
he's
still
under
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you.
the
main
reliance
of
petitioner
is
on
the
burgett
line
of
cases.
and
we
think
those
cases
are
distinguishable
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
burgett,
and
in
loper,
and
in
tucker,
the
reliability
of
the
individual
conviction
was
at
issue
which
is
to
say
that
a
sentence
was
enhanced
or
credibility
destroyed
by
reference
to
an
uncounseled
conviction.
that
is
not
the
case
under
the
federal
gun
laws.
the
reliability
of
the
individual
conviction
as
an
indicator
of
the
individual
defendant's
propensity
to
misuse
firearms
is
simply
not
at
issue
in
the
federal
gun
law.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i'm
not
sure
i
got
mr.
justice
white's
questions
so
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
after
he
overturns
his
conviction,
he
receives
a
firearm?
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
then
he
has
violated
section
922
(g)
or
(h),
excuse
me,
which
refers
to
the
receipt
of
a
firearm
but
anyone
under
indictment
for
a
felony.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there's
no
provision
under
1202
(a)
(1)
for
persons
under
indictment
and
if
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
so
after
his
conviction
is
overturned.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
then
he
is
not
subject
to
the
limitations
of
section
1202
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
--
but
some
court
has
vacated
the
order
of
conviction
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
it
doesn't
mean
who
has
ever
been
convicted.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
statute
as
we
construe
it
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
and
i
suggested
that
that
might
literally
be
what
that
statute
says.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
--
well
certainly,
if
that
is
the
literal
reading
of
the
statute
which
we
don't
have
to
decide
here
because
here
we
have
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
literal
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
when
you
think
of
someone
claiming
or
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
you
don't
think
of
someone
who
has
overturned
that
conviction
because
the
order
of
conviction
has
been
vacated.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
he
could.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
not
going
to
argue
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
if
--
if
the
man
has
had
his
conviction
overturned,
he's
no
longer
someone
who
has
been
convicted.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
because
the
word
convicted
is
used
by
congress
there
and
our
view
means
that
someone
who
has
a
conviction
outstanding.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
court
need
not
decided
that
question
here
since
in
any
event
your
broader
reading
of
the
words
has
been
convicted
certainly
applies
to
a
petitioner
who
has
never
overturned
his
conviction.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
we're
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
we
are.
we
are
saying
that
the
plain
meaning
of
that
statute
is
not
the
broader
definition
or
literal
definition
that
you're
pressing
upon
me
but
rather
a
median
position
between
what
petitioner
can
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you.
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
in
any
way
--
i'm
aware
of
no
federal
persecution
for
someone
who
has
possessed
or
received
a
firearm
after
the
time
that
their
conviction
was
overturned
and
that
is
the
policy
that
the
government
follows
with
regards
to
this
act.
i
started
to
try
to
distinguish
burgett
and
that
line
of
cases
and
i
first
--
at
the
first
distinction,
is
the
distinction
that
this
court
drew
in
loper
itself.
in
a
footnote
in
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case,
the
court
distinguished
between
two
things.
first
of
all
there
is
a
--
what
was
not
good
in
that
case,
was
the
use
of
an
uncounseled
conviction
to
impeach
a
defendant's
testimony
generally.
however
the
court's
suggested
a
different
result
would
be
reached
if
on
direct
testimony
the
defendant
got
up
and
said,
“i've
never
been
convicted”
simply
ignoring
the
fact
of
his
prior
conviction
albeit
uncounseled.
in
that
case
he
would
just
be
for
ignoring
the
historical
fact
of
his
conviction
as
opposed
to
its
--
the
general
impeachment
where
the
reliability
of
the
conviction
is
critical
to
its
impeachment
value
and
here
we
say
the
same
thing.
the
reliability
of
the
individual
conviction
with
regard
to
the
defendant's
propensity
to
misuse
firearm
is
only
relevant
in
two
aspects.
first,
in
the
administrator
proceeding
before
the
secretary
of
treasury
and
also
that
the
general
groups
of
persons
who
have
been
convicted
are
more
likely
to
misuse
firearms
than
the
populace
at
large.
however,
in
the
criminal
trial
itself
is
only
the
historical
fact
of
conviction
which
is
at
issue.
the
second
distinction
i
would
draw
between
the
burgett
line
of
cases
and
this
case
is
that
congress
has
simply
provided
a
timing
differential.
the
defendant
who
was
personally
been
convicted
must
go
out
and
clear
his
name
prior
to
obtaining
the
firearm.
and
the
civil
disability
which
is
imposed
by
the
statute
attaches
immediately
upon
conviction.
the
criminal
penalty
is
imposed
when
he
simply
ignores
the
civil
disability
and
ignores
the
administrative
procedures
set
up
by
congress
or
judicial
proceures.
in
burgett
and
in
loper
and
in
tucker,
the
first
time
that
the
prior
conviction
allegedly
uncounseled
convictions
in
those
cases
became
relevant
was
that
the
criminal
proceeding
itself,
not
immediately
upon
the
conviction.
and
therefore
it
was
appropriate
to
allow
the
defendants
in
those
cases
to
challenge
the
validity
of
their
prior
convictions
at
the
criminal
trial.
here,
petitioner
eschewed
his
right
to
challenge
those
--
his
prior
conviction
at
an
earlier
stage
which
congress
recommended
him
to
do
so
and
for
failing
to
do
that,
congress
has
imposed
a
penalty.
if
counsel's
interpretation
of
the
burgett
line
of
cases
and
the
sixth
amendment
is
correct,
it
would
lead
us
to
conclusion
that
a
person
who
is
convicted
albeit
without
counsel
and
is
in
jail
could
escape
from
jail
without
any
kind
of
penalty
being
attached.
you
could
only
ignore
the
fact
of
his
conviction
and
walk-out
tomorrow
because
under
his
theory
there's
no
--
it's
as
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
conviction.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
or
this
court
meant
in
those
cases.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
mr.
wood
suggest
the
court
didn't
--
i
think
corrected
that
--
that
case
says
that
the
court
didn't
reach
that
issue.
it
didn't
have
to
and
the
court
in
virginia
has
never
said
that
and
the
other
courts
that
have
suggested
quite
the
opposite.
that
person
can't
simply
ignore
the
fact
of
his
conviction
and
escape.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
think
he
says
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i'm
now
referring
to
his
constitutional
argument
and
not
his
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
and
not
his
statutory
argument.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
as
to
that
the
logic
disposition
leads
to
conclusion
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
justify
such
as
an
escape
as
a
defendant
just
could
simply
ignore
the
fact
of
his
conviction
and
walk
out
the
jailhouse
store.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
judge,
i
would
have
to
say
that.
yes,
sir.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
