mr.
andrew
w.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
george
calvin
lewis,
jr.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
lewis
was
charged
in
a
two-count
indictment,
one
count
of
which
is
relevant
to
your
honors'
consideration.
they
charged
him
with
a
violation
of
section
1202
of
18
u.s.c.
app.
that
is
the
possession
of
a
firearm
having
previously
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
the
case
came
on
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
richmond
without
a
jury,
on
the
morning
of
trial,
counsel
in
a
motion
in
a
context
of
a
motion
for
a
continuance
pointed
out
to
the
court
in
a
proffer
that
the
conviction
which
formed
the
basis
for
the
indictment
had
been
obtained
in
counsel's
judgment
in
violation
and
pure
violation
of
gideon
against
wainwright.
counsel
told
the
court
that
he
had
called
a
lawyer
in
florida
that
had
been
kind
enough
to
check
the
records
and
that
the
records
of
the
florida
court,
the
records
on
the
day
of
trial
showed
affirmatively
that
lewis
had
no
lawyer.
collaterally,
the
--
was
also
represented
to
the
court
that
the
indictment
possibly
was
defective
although
that
that
issue
was
not
pursued
in
view
of
the
trial
court's
ruling
on
gideon.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
this
is
not
a
--
a
solid
record.
i
--
i
was
told
that
counsel
was
told
by
the
lawyer
in
florida
that
it
showed
affirmatively
that
lewis
had
no
lawyer.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
it
was
a
proffer
though
and
was
accepted
by
the
government
for
prep
is
of
course
ruined.
i
would
submit
that
--
that
settles
that
issue.
i
might
point
out
so
that
the
actual
record
which
was
introduced
were
the
orders
on
the
day
of
sentencing
that
the
orders
with
respect
to
the
finding
of
guilt,
i
believe
that
order
that
is
in
the
record
recites
that
lewis
having
previously
or
earlier
have
been
found
guilty
came
on
this
day
to
be
sentenced.
that
is
a
silent
record.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
i
am
happy
to
accept
the
burden
of
proof,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
am
happy
to
accept
the
burden
of
proof.
you're
saying
reverse
and
dismiss,
i'm
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
offer
the
proof,
granted
the
continuance
that
lewis
in
fact
had
no
lawyer
also
made
a
proffer
of
indigency.
so
that
this
is
unlike
some
of
the
earlier
cases
in
the
dissenting
opinions
in
which
no
burden
of
proof
was
even
attempted
to
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
dispute
that.
i
say
things
sometimes
not
knowing
what
i'm
saying.
but
i
don't
recall
ever
conceding
that
and
judge
winter
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
that
i
do
not
understand
the
appellant
lewis,
to
concede
that
is
facially
valid.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well,
that
--
that
question
has
been
addressed
by
this
court
with
--
with
agony
i'm
sure
sometimes,
but
it's
never
too
--
too
late
to
cure
a
wrong
that
was
done
whether
it's
20
years
ago
or
50
years
ago.
certainly
it's
--
it's
a
problem.
i
might
say
practically,
sir,
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
problem.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
in
view
what
i
was
told
by
this
lawyer
in
florida.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well,
as
the
same,
mr.
chief
justice
it
came
on
--
on
a
proffer.
i
presume
that
had
the
judge
agreed
with
me,
i
presume
that
he
would've
granted
the
continuance.
it
was
a
non-jury
trial.
it
only
took
a
couple
of
hours
to
try.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
had
always
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
have
never
understood
their
position
to
be
any
different.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
presume
there
would
be
a
remand.
and
i
didn't
take
it
as
a
stipulation
so
much
as
simply
for
the
purpose
of
argument
for
the
purpose
of
my
proffer.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
by
--
by
re
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
an
inquiry
into
that
factual
inquiry.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
oh,
absolutely
sir.
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
congressional
intent
in
the
indictment
phase
is
obviously
--
indictment
of
course
is
a
temporary
disability.
one
has
his
constitutional
guarantees
for
example
to
a
speedy
trial
which
will
remove
it
in
a
short
time
and
the
use
of
the
word
indictment
certainly
is
unequivocal.
may
it
please
the
court,
in
constructing
the
statute
i
would
argue
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
the
government
i
think,
the
trust
to
the
government's
argument
has
been
and
seems
to
be
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
exclude
lewis
from
the
scope
of
the
statute
that
is
to
exclude
people
who've
been
convicted
in
violation
of
gideon
that
it
would
have
spelled
it
out.
i
think
the
reverse
really
is
true
i
think
that
had
congress
with
its
awareness
of
gideon
had
meant
to
include
people
like
lewis.
i
think
it's
just
as
logical
to
say
that
they
would
have
spelled
that
out.
i'm
told
that
--
for
example,
after
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
and
some
other
cases,
there
was
considerable
congressional
discussion
about
certain
cases.
and
of
course
i
don't
believe
there's
ever
been
any
great
congressional
stir
over
the
court's
ruling
in
gideon
so
that
certainly
they
were
aware
of
gideon.
i
believe
burgett
is
the
--
a
year
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act
of
197
--
1968-1970
where
burgett
--
so
that
i
think
the
constitutional
issue
can
be
avoided
simply
on
statutory
construction.
likewise,
we
are
dealing
with
a
penal
statute.
now
it
must
be
strictly
construed.
i
would
suggest
if
your
honors
please
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
for
more
than
one
reason.
obviously,
if
you
took
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
one
who
was
convicted
of
a
felony
and
one
on
appeal
for
example
and
had
the
thing
dismissed,
and
later,
possesses
the
firearm.
well,
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
this
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
i
don't
believe
it
excludes
people.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
that's
right.
and
--
and
yet,
lewis,
even
if
he
had
filed
his
writ
of
coram
nobis,
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
or
what
have
you,
and
had
the
judgment
vacated,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
still
would
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
at
some
time
prior.
so
i
think
the
--
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
i
think
there's
an
ambiguity
or
latent
ambiguity
in
--
in
the
word
felon
or
felony
or
convicted
of
a
felony.
i
think
it's
arguably
certainly
and
i
think
convincingly
that
that
means
validly
convicted,
certainly
not
void.
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
question
in
this
--
in
this
court's
rulings
in
loper,
and
burgett,
and
tucker.
that
--
that's
devoid
--
they're
not
voidable
convictions
and
violations
get
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe,
that
in
loper
against
beto,
you
--
you
frame
the
question
in
those
words
may
the
petitioner
attack,
avoid
judgment,
avoid
conviction.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
so
but
i
think
there
is
an
important
difference.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
do
see
a
difference.
i
think
the
--
the
man
that
you
mentioned
first,
the
man
who
had
his
jury
trial
presumably
had
a
fair
trial.
i
think
it
might
be
more
analogous
to
say
what
if
he
had
a
jury
trial
but
no
lawyer.
we're
talking
about,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
most
precious
of
all
federal
rights
that
you
--
that
this
we
know,
the
rest
of
them
are
meaningless.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
at
least,
that
man
has
had
it
fair
and
square.
if
he
argued
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
that's
correct
and
it
raises
an
interesting
point
that
i've
thought
about
is
what
if
lewis
had
come
into
--
to
my
office
and
i
hope
i
don't
publically
confess
malpractice
or
potential
for
it.
but
--
but
if
he'd
come
in
and
said,
“look,
i've
been
convicted
in
violation
of
gideon
against
wainwright.
i
had
absolutely
no
lawyer,
and
what
i've
got
to
do?”
i
don't
think
it
would
be
malpractice
for
a
lawyer
to
say
nothing.
that
is
do
nothing.
it's
a
void
conviction.
now
i
think
that
--
that
law
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
that's
right,
sir.
i
--
i
mean
obviously,
we'd
take
the
precaution
but
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
to
have
his
record
clear.
yes
sir,
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
it
may
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
of
course
lewis,
i
believe
it's
four
years,
if
i
recall,
two
or
three
or
four
years,
whatever,
that
was
the
time
to
--
to
do
it,
why
he
didn't
do
it,
of
course
none
of
us
know.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
sir,
i
--
i
think
as
the
law
review
article,
the
harvard
law
review
article
points
out,
i
think,
a
line
has
to
be
drawn.
but
unfortunately,
i
think
and
i
haven't
provided
a
line
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
a
void,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
think
so.
it
--
it
might
be
that
a
--
a
proper
distinction
to
make
is
between
a
conviction
that's
void
or
one
that's
voidable
if
anybody
can
determine
what
that
is.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
agree.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
i
didn't
mean
that.
i
--
perhaps
was
over
responding
but
i
was
suggesting
that
obviously
a
line
has
to
be
drawn.
you
can't
come
in
collaterally
attack
on
any
ground.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
he
spent
--
he
spent
some
years
in
prison,
judge
--
mr.
justice
burger.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well,
he
was
--
he
knew
he's
behind
bars.
i
don't
mean
--
no,
sir,
he
never
attacked
it
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
of
course,
you
know,
as
you
pointed
out
in
a
dissent,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
lewis
was
convicted,
i
mean,
it
was
the
law
of
the
land.
i
believe
he
was
convicted
just
prior
to
gideon.
and
--
and
put
away
in
prison
in
florida,
i
believe,
this
is
in
the
records,
i'm
not
going
outside
it
when
he
--
when
he
got
out
of
in
florida,
he
joined
the
army
and
went
to
vietnam.
and
then
came
out
--
so
no,
he
didn't
think
it
was
void
obviously.
i
would
like
to,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
touch
on
some
more
aspects
of
the
constitutionality.
as
--
as
i
said,
i
believe
throughout
the
case
in
my
brief,
i
think
the
--
the
issue
before
you
boils
down
to
an
interpretation
of
three
cases
chiefly
burgett,
loper
and
tucker,
and
analyzing
each
of
the
three,
i
come
not
only
within
the
majority
opinions
but
i
believe
that
i
am
safe
on
the
dissents
as
--
as
well.
i
know
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
some
members
of
the
court
were
concerned
because
in
loper
and
in
tucker,
you
--
you
were
speaking
not
only
or
not
of
a
prospective
application
of
gideon
but
you
were
talking
about
a
retrospective
application.
that
is,
these
trials
where
the
evidence
was
introduced
of
the
gideon
violations.
these
trials
have
taken
place
long
before
gideon
was
ever
decided
and
at
the
time
they
were
introduced,
this
is
the
case,
i
believe,
in
tucker,
the
--
or
in
loper.
the
trial
judge
rule
correctly
was
law
of
the
land.
that
is
not
the
case
here,
of
course.
lewis'
trial
in
--
in
richmond
a
couple
of
years
ago,
the
law
of
the
land
was
gideon
and
he
had
been
clearly
convicted
in
--
in
violation
of
that.
so
i
believe
i
have
excluded
that
portion
of
the
dissent.
i
find
it
impossible
or
difficult
as
judge
winter
did
to
make
any
meaningful
distinction
between
this
case
and
burgett
against
texas.
i
had
thought
that
the
court
had
made
it
clear
that
a
conviction
obtained
in
violation
of
gideon
was
useless
to
any
purpose
due
to
enhanced
punishment
or
to
establish
guilt,
and
both
were
done
in
this
case.
that
is
--
he
gets
18
months
to
serve
for
--
by
reason
of
this
conviction
so
he's
got
an
enhanced
punishment
and
it
was
used
as
a
predicate
for
the
conviction
itself.
that
is
the
--
the
whole
basis
for
it
was
this
conviction
in
violation
of
gideon.
i
would,
mr.
chief
justice
ask
the
balance
of
my
time
be
reserved
for
whatever
rebuttal
i
had.
finally,
i
had
one
thing
that
i
--
i
think
i've
made
clear
but
it's
worth
repeating
and
that
is,
the
government
and
i
apparently
differ
on
the
phraseology
of
the
issue.
i
phrased
it
so
in
the
petition
that
whether
one
convicted
in
violation
of
gideon
against
wainwright
could
defend
a
firearms
charge
on
that
basis.
the
government
has
a
more
sweeping
phraseology
and
they
had
throughout
their
brief
referred
to.
it
has
made
one
attack
to
the
constitutionality.
i
come
here
today
on
the
wings
of
gideon,
loper,
burgett,
not
on
any
other
basis.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
1968,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
judge,
i
don't
know.
i
believe
there
may
have
been
but
i
--
i
honestly
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
sir.
as
--
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
i
believe
in
bass
and
in
batchelder.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
comments
if
i
may.
the
--
excuse
me
--
the
joint
appendix
if
your
honor
please
beginning
at
pages
two,
three
and
so
on
show
clearly
that
the
point
i
believe
was
preserved.
the
appendix
will
show
that
the
--
after
the
government
had
rested
its
case-in-chief,
and
i
--
i
believe
called
mr.
lewis
to
the
stand
to
testify
on
other
matters,
we
made
the
proffer
again
and
that
as
we
told
the
judge
that
in
view
of
his
earlier
ruling
that
the
evidence
of
the
gideon
violation
would
not
be
received
that
we
would
not
go
into
that
matter.
of
course
it's
conceivable
that
we
could've
gone
forward
even
without
any
records
and
had
the
man
testified
to
it,
he
may
have
been
believed.
but
in
view
of
the
judge's
earlier
ruling
he
held
that
that
would
not
be
necessary
to
present
that
such
proof.
i
would
only
have
a
few
more
comments
if
i
have
time
and
that
is
the
government
has
stressed
that
lewis
and
people
like
lewis
should
have
their
convictions
expunged,
file
petitions
for
writs
of
coram
nobis.
real
life
just
is
not
that
way.
lewis
is
not
an
educated
man
as
are
many
people
who
are
in
his
fix
and
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
way.
and
i
think
this
court
knows
it
and
i
see
--
to
me
it's
unthinkable
that
the
constitution
would
permit
some
kind
of
penalty
for
his
failure
to
have
done
that.
he
is
already
in
trouble
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
i'm
talking
about
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
oh
certainly
sir.
there's
a
difference
between
saying
ignorance
is
no
excuse
so
or
no
defense
and
saying
that
we've
got
to
place
an
obligation
on
the
man.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well
i
think
that
the
government
--
i
think
makes
a
fallacious
argument
on
this
score.the
loper
decision
has
submit
is
controlling.
the
real
holding
in
that
case
is
that
it
simply
can't
be
used
affirmatively
by
the
prosecution
and
that's
the
essence
of
it
and
we
just
don't
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
judge,
i've
thought
about
that
a
good
deal
this
morning
and
about
the
perjury
aspect
of
it,
i
think
it's
an
interesting
analogy.
i
think
--
i
can't
remember
the
leading
case
this
court
decided
not
too
long
ago
on
perjury
but
i
remember
reading
it
sometime
back
and
i
would
think
that
we
have
a
difficult
time
convicting
him
of
perjury.
i
think
there
is
enough
ambiguity
in
the
word
felon.
i
think
it
means
validly
convicted
felon.
i
think
it
certainly
excludes
the
man
who
is
convicted
of
a
so-called
felon
in
the
absence
of
flagrant
denial
of
a
sixth
amendment
right.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no,
sir.
i
make
no
distinction
really.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well
--
i
don't
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
no
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
well,
i
think
the
line
can
be
drawn
with
the
case
you
have
before
you
today
is
a
gideon
violation.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i
think
the
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
have
--
i'm
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
yes,
and
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
can
draw
a
line
let's
assume
that
--
mr.
andrew
w.
wood
between
those
that
are
--
that
are
--
for
example,
obviously
void
and
those
that
are
voidable,
whatever
that
is.
i
confess
not
to
be
able
to
articulate
the
distinction
very
well.
but
i
think
mine
is
an
obviously
void
case.
