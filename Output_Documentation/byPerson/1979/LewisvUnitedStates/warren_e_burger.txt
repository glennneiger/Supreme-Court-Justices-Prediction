chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
lewis
against
the
united
states.
mr.
wood,
we'll
just
wait
until
the
courtroom
clears,
you
may
be
seated
if
you
wish.
mr.
wood,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
dissenting
judge
make
any
issue
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
wasn't
there
some
other
way
to
make
that
a
little
more
clearer
and
eliminate
it
as
an
issue
in
the
case?
the
proof
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
--
is
the
final
sentence
in
his
or
final
two
sentences
in
his
dissent
put
a
mild
amount
of
question
on
that
because
it
--
judge
winter
would
remand
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not.
remand
for
a
new
trial
at
which
time
it
could
be
demonstrated
unequivocally
one
way
or
the
other,
he
hold
those.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
between
judge
winter's
view
that
could
not
be
accomplished
except
by
granting
a
new
trial
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
making
a
new
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
exactly
what
you're
doing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
doesn't
the
reversal
affirmatively
vacate
the
conviction
so
that
there
is
at
that
time
no
conviction
extent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
--
is
it
quite
like
the
situation
you
have
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
you
were
planning
on
going
out
and
buying
a
firearm.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
have
your
response
clear
in
mind.
do
you
say
that
kind
of
conviction
as
voidable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
you
--
did
you
say
that
he
spent
four
years
in
prison
under
this
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he
certainly
didn't
think
his
conviction
was
void
during
that
period,
did
he,
whether
that
makes
some
difference
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
had
no
--
he
had
no
habeas
corpus,
no
collateral
attack
of
any
kind
on
the
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levander.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
see
if
i
have
that
there.
show
that
he
was
uncounseled
or
did
not
show
that
he
had
counsel,
which
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
--
is
it
what
you're
saying
that
if
the
man
wants
to
purchase
a
firearm
for
whatever
reason,
let's
assume
he
was
going
to
be
a
guard
at
a
plant
or
a
bank
that
his
first
step
is
to
go
and
have
--
take
affirmative
action
like
collateral
attack
on
the
conviction
and
have
it
set
aside
on
that
ground.
and
then,
proceed
to
purchase
the
firearm
in
which
he
could
recite
that
there
was
no
valid
conviction
outstanding
against
him
or
words
to
that
effect.
is
that
what
you're
saying
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
that
question,
whether
they
be
trusted
or
whether
they
are
the
kind
of
people,
people
who
fit
into
the
category
that
congress
said
should
not
be
permitted
to
have
firearms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
had
been
indicted
and
the
indictment
had
never
pressed,
he'd
never
been
tried
and
was
out
on
bail
for
three
years,
four
years.
now,
the
statute
--
would
the
statute
apply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
would
--
but
i'm
assuming
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
he's
waited
three
or
four
years
and
has
done
nothing
and
he's
still
under
indictment
and
he's
then
in
the
same
posture
as
this
fellow
going
into
an
illegal
establishment
with
a
--
packing
a
gun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
he
be
convicted
--
can
he
be
indicted
and
convicted
for
having
violated
the
statute
by
obtaining
a
gun
while
there's
an
outstanding
indictment
against
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
habeas
corpus
judgement
doesn't
nullify
the
indictment.
it
nullifies
only
the
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
wood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
number
states
have
a
provision
that
the
person
is
incarcerated
in
the
prison
under
a
life
sentence
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
it
commits
a
homicide
and
never
to
escape
for
example
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
death
penalty
is
mandatory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
suppose
you
have
the
land
who
is
in
prison
uncounseled
conviction
for
murder
is
under
the
guilty
plea
without
counsel
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
he
is
in
for
life.
he
commits
the
homicide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
have
to
say
i
suppose
that
he
could
not
be
under
that
statute
because
he
is
in
custody
under
an
uncounseled
--
therefore
unconstitutional
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
two
opinions
to
announce
this
morning,
the
opinion
in
lewis
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
