justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
with
judge
--
or
judge
russell's
statement
in
the
opinion
for
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
first
page
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
has
its
app.1
where
judge
russell
says,
"the
defendant
does
not
deny
in
this
appeal
the
receipt
and
possession
of
a
firearm
neither
does
he
dispute
his
earlier
conviction
in
florida
or
that
such
conviction
is
facially
valid."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
sir.
he
pointed
it
out,
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
as
i've
just
said,
he
did
not
understand
my
position
to
be
conceding
facial
validity.
i
might
add
if
it's
responsive
that
i
frankly
see
no
difference
between
facial
validity
or
invalidity
for
that
matter.
he
may
need
or
had
a
lawyer
or
he
didn't
and
to
me
that
is
a
technical
nicety
which
has
no
place
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
go
back
20
years,
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
find
out
whether
he
had
a
lawyer
or
didn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
language
of
congress
on
its
face
is
susceptible
of
in
--
including
within
its
sweep
the
position
of
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
by
a
jury
as
appealed
and
as
the
appellate
court
has
reversed
the
judgment
and
directed
a
judgment
of
not
guilty
to
be
entered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
--
do
--
and
you
really
see
no
difference
between
that
and
the
question
of
a
person
who's
been
convicted
and
who,
after
--
after
he's
prosecuted
under
the
statute,
and
has
--
who's
never
appealed
as
now
says,
i
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
he
--
he
was
--
he
was
successful
too
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
and
the
guy's
conviction
reversed.
here,
this
person
never
bothered
to
take
any
action
to
get
his
conviction
set
aside
until
he
was
indicted
for
a
new
trial
for
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
for
another
offense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
had
been
admissible,
that
proffer
even
in
--
in
the
present
trial.
i
mean
its
double
hearsay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levander,
let
me
get
back
a
minute
to
this
continuance
question.
i
can
fully
understand
the
government's
desire
to
resolve
a
case
on
a
fairly
broad
basis,
but
after
the
continuance
was
denied,
a
trial
took
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
any
evidence
adduced
at
trial
to
show
that
the
prior
conviction
was
uncounseled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
judge
refused
the
proffer
during
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
reason
you
can
make
burgett
into
a
due
process
case.
