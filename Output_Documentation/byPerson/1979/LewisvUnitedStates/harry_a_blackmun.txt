justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wood,
did
it
--
did
it
show
affirmatively
that
they
had
no
lawyer
or
did
it
just
show
or
fail
to
show
that
he
had
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
anything
on
the
record
other
than
that
counsel
told?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
--
what
is
your
position
here
if
we
go
along
with
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
conviction
must
be
reversed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say
it
again.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wood,
under
922
(h)
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
it
would
be
sufficient
if
your
client
were
merely
under
indictment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
square
with
your
position
as
to
convictions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
were
you
going
to
apply
for
a
job
wherein
you
list
any
prior
felony
conviction
i
suppose
it
might
be
desirable
to
have
his
record
clear,
wouldn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
most
of
the
times
that
would
be
a
bar
to
employment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
also,
i
assume
he
could
probably
take
some
risk
of
retrial
whenever
he
does
it
too.
if
he
sets
--
decide
whatever
the
conviction
was
and
the
statute
hasn't
ran,
he
takes
his
chances
on
what
will
happen
the
next
time
around.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wood,
supposing
instead
of
no
lawyer
he'd
offered
to
prove
and
for
purposes
of
decision
the
government
accepted
the
fact
that
his
conviction
rested
entirely
on
a
conviction
that
was
obtained
from
him
by
stringing
him
up
over
a
door
and
beating
him
up
or
something
like
that.
and
therefore,
the
conviction
was
void.
what
do
you
--
what
would
you
say
about
that
kind
of
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
conception
of
that
would
be
void
--
that
would
be
a
void
conviction,
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
would
be
a
void
conviction,
i
guess
but
that's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that's
just
as
void
as
one
where
you
don't
have
a
lawyer,
is
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
so
that
distinction
would
mean
he'd
have
--
if
you
prevail
here,
he
should
have
the
same
right,
wouldn't
he?
logically,
it
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
was
this
section
passed
under
which
you're
client
was
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
1968.
was
there
a
predecessor
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
levander,
well,
do
you
say
that
if
a
--
if
a
prior
conviction
has
been
set
aside
that
he
is
still
subject
to
this
section?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
has
been
convicted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
has
been,
isn't
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
statute
says
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says,
it
says
he
has
been
convicted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that's
the
argument
--
that's
the
argument
your
colleague
uses.
it's
a
very
--
why
don't
you
just
say
valid
conviction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
that
word
rather
than
the
other.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
might
be
but
it
said,
who
has
been
convicted.
that's
--
and
that
literally
would
cover
my
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
say
no,
you
should
construe
that
out
of
the
statute
and
your
colleague
says,
well,
you
just
should
--
if
that
--
if
you're
going
to
do
that
what
--
you
had
to
ask
congress.
surely,
they
wouldn't
have
intended
to
include
an
invalid
conviction
on
this
prohibition.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
--
you
mean
either
if
he
served
his
sentence
especially
if
he
served
his
sentence.
his
conviction
is
still,
you
say
a
valid
conviction
and
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
--
what
about
one
who've
been
convicted
but
he's
appealed
with
his
case
and
the
case
is
pending.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
it's
on
appeal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
the
same
point
mr.
justice
white
made
before
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
levander,
isn't
it
is
just
like
the
first
amendment,
congress
shall
make
no
law
means
congress
may
make
some
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
you
have
because
of
your
petite
policy
and
you
don't
indict
in
this
cases
where
and
they
can
be
set
aside.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wood,
if
the
extent
of
--
just
confining
it
to
a
constitutional
inquiry,
supposing
some
cities
do
they
have
this
regulation
that
you
can't
be
a
cab
driver
if
you've
been
convicted
with
felon,
they
have
a
form
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
that
you
fill
out
and
one
of
the
questions
is,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony
and
if
you
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
and
he
answered
this
falsely,
he'd
be
indicted
for
perjury.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
just
ignores
it
because
it
is
totally
void,
can
he
be
indicted
for
perjury
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
section
1202
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
prohibits
the
possession
of
a
firearm
by
any
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
mr.
lewis,
the
petitioner
here
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
that
statute.
the
prosecution
introduced
in
evidence
an
earlier
judgment
in
a
florida
state
court
that
on
his
plea
of
guilty,
lewis
was
guilty
of
a
felony
for
breaking
and
entering.
that
conviction
remains
outstanding.
defense
counsel,
however,
informed
the
court
that
mr.
lewis
had
not
been
represented
by
counsel
in
the
florida
proceeding.
the
defense
took
the
position
that
because
the
florida
conviction
was
subject
to
attack
under
gideon
against
wainwright,
that
conviction
could
not
constitute
the
predicate
for
a
prosecution
under
the
federal
statute.
the
district
court
and
by
a
divided
vote,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that
claim.
because
of
a
conflict
on
this
issue
among
the
courts
of
appeals
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
even
though
the
earlier
state
court
felony
conviction
might
be
subject
to
collateral
attack
under
the
gideon
decision
it
may
properly
be
used
as
a
predicate
for
the
subsequent
federal
conviction.
we
reach
this
result
because
of
what
seems
to
us
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
and
our
perception
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
that
statute.
if
the
florida
conviction
is
vulnerable,
congress
intended
that
the
defendant
clear
his
status
by
attacking
that
state
conviction
successfully
or
by
pardon
or
by
a
specific
permit
to
carry
a
firearm
before
obtaining
the
weapon.
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
any
felony
conviction
even
an
allegedly
invalid
one
is
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
to
prohibit
the
possession
of
a
firearm.
we
find
this
holding
not
inconsistent
with
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
relative
to
the
use
of
a
prior
on
counsel
conviction
for
certain
purposes.
and
i
am
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell.
