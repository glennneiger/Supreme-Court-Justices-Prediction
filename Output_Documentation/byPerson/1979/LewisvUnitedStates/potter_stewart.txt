justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
wood,
the
--
judge
winter's
dissenting
opinion
says
that
in
arguing
the
correctness
of
the
district
court's
ruling,
the
government
in
fact
concedes
that
for
the
present
purposes,
the
conviction
was
obtained
in
violation
of
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
i
had
understood
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
case
here,
the
government
makes
the
same
concession
justice
potter
stewart
i
assume
at
least
accepts
the
hypothesis.
justice
potter
stewart
and
argues
upon
that
hypothesis.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
really
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
it?
i
mean,
i
--
i
haven't
heard
the
petitioner
question
for
example
that
congress
--
the
power
of
congress
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
people
who
have
been
indicted
for
something.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
it,
with
the
due
process
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
did
not
understand
mr.
wood's
basic
argument
to
be
that
congress
would
not
have
had
the
power
to
do
this
but
that
in
fact
congress
did
not.
that
it's
a
matter
basically
of
statutory
construction.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i
misapprehended
both.
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
do
it
but
also
that
he
could
not.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
could
not.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
that
argument
that
you're
not
addressing
yourself.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
proceed
mr.
levander,
i
didn't
understand
--
i
didn't
--
i
don't
think
i
got
your
answer
to
my
brother
white's
questions.
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
first
--
as
i
understood
it,
a
person
is
convicted,
he
then
collaterally
attacks
his
conviction
successfully
and
has
that
conviction
set
aside
and
a
state
appeals
and
at
that
time,
may
he
be
indicted
for
violation
of
title
18
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
pending
on
appeal
by
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
talking
about
1202
(a)
(1)
which
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
no.
but
that's
the
statute
that's
involved
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
so
we're
talking
about
that
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
although,
he's
literally
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
because
he
has
been
convicted
by
a
court
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
has
been
convicted.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
it
says.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
says
“who
has
been
convicted”
and
that
would
make
it
illegal
for
such
a
person
to
possess
a
firearm
even
though
his
conviction
had
been
set
aside
on
direct
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
what
the
statute
says
literally
and
you're
relying
on
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
i
assume,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
potter
stewart
the
literal
term
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
don't
think
of
somebody
as
such
but
the
congress
said,
made
the
statute
applicable,
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
anybody
who
has
been
convicted
regardless
of
the
ultimate
fate
of
that
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
can't
be
under
1202
(a)
(1),
can
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
statute
about
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
--
well,
how
come?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you're
telling
us
the
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
was
wondering
just
how
--
what
your
argument
was.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
relying
on
the
words
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
somewhere
in
between
with
what
it
says
and
what
it
doesn't
say.
justice
potter
stewart
some
people
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wood
tell
us
his
in
your
plan
of
briefs
that
virginia
has
held
just
that.
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
think
that
conclusion
inevitably
follows
from
his
argument
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
dealing
with
an
act
of
congress
and
it's
really
at
least
one
of
his
points
is,
it's
a
matter
of
construing
that
act
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe
the
--
maybe
the
act
of
congress
makes
it
a
penal
offense
to
escape
from
a
jail,
a
prison
would
have
a
--
that
would
be
a
question
of
construing
that
act
of
congress
quite
a
different
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
