justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
about
the
case
where
the
possession
of
firearms
takes
place
before
a
conviction
has
been
overturned
but
it's
overturned
prior
to
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
--
it
just
depend
--
it's
the
crucial
--
it's
when
he
possesses
a
firearm.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
--
if
he's
cleared
it
under
--
in
habeas
corpus
and
that
is
on
appeal
by
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
clear,
the
state
has
appealed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
--
his
one
at
--
in
the
trial
--
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
has
appealed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
purpose
does
that
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
still
under
indictment
but
how
about
--
let's
say
he
possesses
a
firearm.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
suppose
you
would
say
he
could
be
convicted
even
if
he
didn't
know
anything
about
the
gun
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i
know
but
even
if
he
--
even
if
he
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
1202,
and
got
the
gun
and
i
suppose
he
could
be
convicted
no
matter
how
innocent
he
thought
he
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it'd
be
different
if
he
were
told
--
if
he
had
been
told
that
prior
to
his
possession
of
the
gun,
now
remember,
don't
pick
up
any
guns
because
either
you've
been
convicted
and
you
haven't
had
it
set
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
relevance
is
it
whether
he's
uneducated
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
then
you're
saying
that
in
the
1202
persecution
you
can
litigate
the
validity
of
your
prior
conviction
on
any
ground
you
want
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
what
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
facial
validity,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
--
what
if
he
just
says
my
conviction
was
invalid
because
they
introduced
tainted
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
the
1202
forward
here
that
kind
of
an
attack
on
his
prior
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
he
claims
that
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
illegally
seized
without
a
search
warrant
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
government
says,
“well,
so
what.”
let's
assume
that
it
was.
you
would
say
that
--
would
that
have
--
kind
of
the
claim
have
to
be
heard
in
your
case,
in
the
1202
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
1202
case
would
the
court
have
to
entertain
that
kind
of
a
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
between
what?
between
one
constitution
(voice
overlap)
