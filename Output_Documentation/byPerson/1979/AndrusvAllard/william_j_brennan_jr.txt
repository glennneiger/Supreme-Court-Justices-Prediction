justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado.
the
secretary
of
interior
has
implemented
the
eagle
protection
act
and
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
with
regulations
that
prohibit
commercial
transactions
with
respect
to
migratory
birds
and
their
parts
including
a
prohibition
of
commercial
transactions
in
parts
of
birds
legally
killed
before
the
birds
came
under
the
protection
of
the
acts.
this
suit
was
brought
by
dealers
and
indian
artifacts
partly
composed
of
feathers
obtained
prior
to
the
effective
dates
of
the
acts.
and
the
dealers
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
alleging
that
the
acts
cannot
be
interpreted
to
authorize
regulations
that
forbid
the
sale
of
artifacts
insofar
as
the
constituent
bird
parts
were
obtained
prior
to
the
effective
dates
of
the
acts
and
that
if
the
regulations
do
apply
to
such
property,
the
regulations
effect
the
taking
without
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
district
court
granted
the
relief
sought
holding
that
the
acts
were
to
be
interpreted
as
not
applicable
to
preexisting
legally
obtained
bird
parts
and
that
therefore
the
regulations
were
void
as
unauthorized
extensions
of
the
acts
and
were
violative
of
appellee's
fifth
amendment
rights.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
both
acts
contemplate
regulatory
prohibition
of
commerce
in
the
parts
of
protected
birds
without
regard
to
when
those
birds
were
originally
taken.
and
we
hold
further
that
--
so
construed
the
acts
and
the
regulations
do
not
effect
a
taking
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
our
reasons
are
set
forth
at
greater
length
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
