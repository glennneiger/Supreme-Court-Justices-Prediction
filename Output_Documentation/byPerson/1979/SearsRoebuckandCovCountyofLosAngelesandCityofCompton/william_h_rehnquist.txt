justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garb,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
standing
issue
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i,
for
one,
would
be
interested,
considering
it
a
part
of
our
article
ii
jurisdictional
limitation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
no
more
than
injury
in
fact,
at
most.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
had
one
other
case
with
a
pennsylvania
statute
under
fire,
and
the
attorney
general
refrained,
in
fact,
said
it
was
unconstitutional;
we
thought
it
was
a
little
strange.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
a
discrimination--and
why
isn't
that
a
discrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
also
have
to
show
more
than
just
injury
in
fact,
the
loss
of
money
that
justice
stevens
was
referring
to?
that
you're
within
the
zone
of
protected
interest.
and
there's
a
two-step
analysis,
as
i
understand
it
from
warth
against
seldon
and
from
barlow's
and
data
processing.
injury
in
fact
simply
is
not
enough
to
confer
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
tax
assessor
isn't
a
party
to
this
suit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
the
county
of
los
angeles.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
he
agrees
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
advise
us
as
to
the
status
of
the
pending
california
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
clark,
are
you
familiar
with
our
decision
in
doremus
v.
board
of
education
in
342
u.s.,
where
the
state
of
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
that
a
taxpayers'
action
would
lie
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
release
time
program
under
new
jersey
law.
there
was
standing
on
the
taxpayer.
and
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
because
it
said
new
jersey
is
free
to
determine
for
itself
state
standing
questions,
but
that
it's
a
federal
question
whether
you
have
a
standing
to
raise
a
federal
constitution
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
you
have
no
individuals
listed
as
--
it's
just
the
county
of
los
angeles.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
challenge
it
on
its
face.
you
have
to
challenge
it
on
the
basis
of
the
goods
of
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
the
goods
which
you
seek
to
tax,
or
which
you
have
had
refund
proceedings
with
respect
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
california
court
of
appeals
would
have
rendered
a
similar
decision,
even
if
declaratory
relief,
if
the
issues
had
been
framed
in
terms
that
12
months
of
now
the
county
of
los
angeles
was
going
to
assess
these
goods
and
the
owners
were
going
to
refuse
to
pay
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
how
free
does
your
court
of
appeals
feel
to
render
declaratory
relief
or
injunctions
just
on
construction
of
statutes
in
the
abstract
without
regard
to
what
may
have
happened
or
what
may
have
been
done
by
the
parties
before
them?
