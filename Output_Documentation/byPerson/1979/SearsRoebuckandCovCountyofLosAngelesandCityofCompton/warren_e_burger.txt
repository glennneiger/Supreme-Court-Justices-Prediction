we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
sears,
roebuck
against
county
of
los
angeles,
no.
78-1577.
mr.
garb,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
be
asked
if
a
state
statute
is
being
challenged,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
garb.
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark,
at
the
outset
would
you
mind
clarifying
for
us
the
absence
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state?
many
states,
as
you
know,
or
some,
at
least,
have
statutes
requiring
the
attorney
general
to
defend
the
state
statute
whenever
and
wherever
it's
attacked.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event,
i
suppose
it's
your
position
that
having
informed
the
attorney
general,
you
have
discharged
any
obligation
which
the
county
has
in
the
matter,
and
from
there
on,
it's
up
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
there
not
also
refund
legislation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes
left,
mr.
garb.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
