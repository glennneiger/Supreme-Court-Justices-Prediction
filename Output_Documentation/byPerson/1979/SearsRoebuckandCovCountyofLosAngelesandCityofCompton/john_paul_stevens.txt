justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garb,
let
me
ask
a
curious
question.
where
is
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
why
isn't
he
here
defending
his
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opponents
this,
but
it
is
strange
when
an
attorney
general
is
not
here
defending
his
statute.
we
have
a
case
tomorrow
in
which
he's
coming
and
defending,
and
his
presence
is
contested.
he
wasn't
here
on
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
on
standing
that
justice
rehnquist
raised?
it's
true
that
the
--
as
i
understand
the
case
--
if
the
exemption
were
broader,
it
would
defeat
the
argument
that
they
make.
but
why
can't
they
argue
that
the
exemption
itself
is
unconstitutional;
if
you
eliminate
the
exemption,
you'll
also
eliminate
the
disparity.
and
they
do
gain
tax
revenues
if
you
hold
the
exemption
unconstitutional.
why
doesn't
that
give
them
standing?
i
don't
quite
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
it's
within
a
statute
that
generally
imposes
a
tax,
as
section
225
says
the
goods
involved
here
are
not
subject
to
tax.
and
the
county
of
los
angeles
says,
that
exemption
is
unconstitutional.
if
you
knock
it
out,
we
will
get
tax
revenue.
why
doesn't
that
give
them
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
saying
you
remove
the
discrimination
by
holding
the
exemption
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
will
get
more
revenue
if
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
that
go
to
the
merits
rather
than
the
standing,
is
what
i'm
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
it's
a
discriminatory
effect
if
the
goods
come
from
nevada,
they're
subject
to
tax;
if
they
come
from
canada,
they're
not
subject
to
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
transhipped
out
of
the
city.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
was
that
not
a
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
maybe
it's
not
an
unconstitutional
discrimination,
but
why
isn't
it
at
least
a
disparity
that
gives
them
standing
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
show
the
statute
costs
you
some
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
really
a
standing
problem
here?
didn't
this
case
get
started
by
the
denial
of
an
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
sears
applied
for
an
exemption,
claimed
an
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
denied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
denied
on
two
grounds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
statutory,
local
statutory
grounds,
and
constitutional
grounds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
sears
took
the
decision
up.
now,
is
there
really
a
lack
of
a
case
or
controversy
when
somebody--when
they're
about
to
levy
a
tax,
and
it's
objected
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be
--
i
can't
imagine
why
there's
any
case
or
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
a
standing
problem;
it's
not
a
case
or
controversy
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
estimate
as
to
the
likelihood
of
that
passage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
opposing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
what
has
been
repealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
county
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
--
why
do
you
say
the
exemption
was
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
these
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
transshipped
goods
are
exempt;
in-state
goods
are
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
the
goods
that
are
shipped
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
exemption
--
does
the
exemption
purport
to
cover
both
of
these
classes
of
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
vice
of
it
you
think,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
not
--
are
you
really
suggesting
that
the
exemption
is
inconsistent
with,
or
frustrates,
any
statutory
enactment
of
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
well
i
take
it
that
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
disagree
with
you
in
that
respect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
--
i
agree,
that
doesn't
answer
the
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
argue
that
there's
no
inconsistency
between
this
exemption
and
the
tariff
laws.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
there's
no
inconsistency;
then
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
they
don't
need
to
have
a
second
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
well
maybe
--
let's
assume
we
disagreed
with
you
on
this
--
in
this
respect,
that
the
exemption
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
statutory
enactment
of
congress.
then
your
argument
is
that
the
commerce
clause
itself,
invalidates
this
exemption,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
invalidates
the
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
on
some
kind
of
commerce,
several
kinds
of
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
we
disagree
with
you
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
say
that
would
just
be
a
frustration
of
the
federal
law,
and
i
will
assume
that
out;
assume
that
out
of
the
case.
then
yours
is
a
straight
commerce
clause
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clark,
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
any
cutting
between
different
kinds
of
foreign
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
just
considered
there
to
be
a
discrimination
between
foreign
as
a
class,
and
all
interstate
as
a
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
your
case
rests
on,
just
one
--
didn't
go
into
your
distinction,
for
example,
between
shipments
to
phoenix
and
shipments
to
sacramento?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
preferred
position
was
that
any
exemption
for
goods
originating
abroad
is
just
a
discrimination
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
against
domestic
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
