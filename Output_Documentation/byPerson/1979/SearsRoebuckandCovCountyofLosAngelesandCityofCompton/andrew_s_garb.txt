mr.
andrew
s.
garb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
stipulated
facts.
the
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
california's
revenue
and
taxation
code,
section
225.
that
statute
was
enacted
in
1975,
following
attempts
by
the
assessors
in
california
to
impose
the
personal
property
tax
on
imported
goods
held
in
the
state
that
had
long
been
considered
immune
under
the
original
package
doctrine.
in
order
to
avoid
and
prevent
the
diversion
of
import
business
from
california
to
other
states
that
offered
more
attractive
tax
laws,
california
enacted
this
exemption
which
applied
to
imported
goods
held
in
the
state
for
shipment
to
other
states.
the
respondents
here
have
attacked
the
statute
as
being
unconstitutional,
alleging
that
the
exemption
that
was
extended
to
imported
goods
held
for
shipment
out
of
the
state
must
also
be
extended
to
interstate
goods
travelling
through
the
state
as
well.
on
the
tax
rule
date,
in
1976,
the
petitioner
held
imported
goods
in
a
warehouse
in
the
state
of
california
for
shipment
out
of
the
state.
these
are
precisely
the
type
of
goods
that
are
exempt
under
section
225.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
had
not
intended
to,
your
honor,
although
we
believe
that
that
issue
is
certainly
an
interesting
one,
and
one
presented
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
would
be
happy
to
address
myself
to
that
issue
if
your
honors
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
certainly;
let
me
address
myself
at
this
time
to
that
issue.
we're
in
an
interesting
situation
here.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
any
shipper
of
interstate
goods
has
ever
been
injured
by
this
statute;
indeed,
we
know
of
no
lawsuit
brought
by
any
interstate
shipper
to
complain
about
this.
we
rather
have
ourselves
in
a
rather
anomalous
situation.
we
have
the
county
of
los
angeles,
which
is
the
revenue
collecting
authority
arguing
here
that
its
parent,
the
state
of
california,
that
enacted
an
exemption
statute,
didn't
go
far
enough.
and
what
they're
contending
here
is
that
the
statute
should
have
gone
further
and
exempted
more
goods.
therefore,
we
have
the
kind
of
situation
where
there
is
no
injured
party,
no
evidence
of
actual
injury
to
anyone
in
a
protected
class
who
has
ever
brought
a
case
of
this
sort.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
we
have
even
no
injury
in
fact,
your
honor.
what
we
had
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
invalidation
of
this
statute
based
on
certain
assumptions,
certain
assumed
competition
between
goods.
and
we
submit
not
only
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
these
assumptions
in
fact
exist
in
fact;
but
moreover,
the
hypothetical
construct,
the
abstraction
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
fact
erroneous.
and
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
for
a
moment,
the
concept
that
was
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
invalidate
the
statute
was
a
suggestion
that
somehow
the
revenue
and
taxation
code,
section
225,
affords
a
competitive
advantage
to
imported
goods,
when
they
compete
with
similar
domestic
goods.
now,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
of
such
competition
in
fact,
but
we
submit
that
that
construct
is
erroneous
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
we
have
many
states
in
this
country
that
have
so-called
free
port
laws;
roughly
three-quarters
of
the
states.
none
of
these
free
port
laws
exempt
locally
manufactured
goods
that
are
sold
within
the
state.
very
few
of
those
statutes
exempt
locally
manufactured
goods
that
are
shipped
to
other
states.
accordingly,
imported
goods
that
are
exempt
under
these
other
free
port
states
compete
with
domestic
goods
that
have
been
taxed,
either
in
those
states
or
in
other
states.
the
same
type
of
competitive
advantage
that
is
alleged
to
exist
as
a
result
of
225
exists
as
well.
and
independent
of
that,
we
have
as
a
corollary
of
our
federal
system
the
fact
that
states
have
broad
autonomy
to
fashion
their
own
tax
systems.
indeed,
we
have
states
such
as
new
york
that
have
decided
to
impose
no
personal
property
tax
whatsoever.
therefore,
when
goods
are
imported
through
new
york,
and
compete
with
domestic
goods
in
other
states
which
have
been
subjected
to
tax
in
those
other
states,
as
a
result
of
the
interaction
between
the
new
york
statute
and
the
other
states'
tax
laws,
the
imported
goods
that
were
free
of
tax
that
came
from
new
york
again
have
precisely
the
same
type
of
competitive
advantage
that
225
of
the
california
revenue
and
taxation
code
is
alleged
to
afford.
now,
if
this
type
of
advantage
is
perceived
as
an
evil,
it
cannot
be
eradicated
by
striking
section
225.
in
fact,
it
could
not
even
be
eradicated
by
striking
the
free
port
acts
of
three-quarters
of
the
states
in
this
country.
we
would
submit
that
this
problem--if
this
situation
is
perceived
as
a
problem,
the
only
solution
would
be
for
congress
to
impose
uniformity
and
require
that
all
states
either
refrain
from
taxing
personal
property
completely,
or
that
all
states
tax
at
precisely
the
same
rate.
and
this,
we
would
submit,
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
held
or
suggested;
and
indeed,
flies
in
the
face
of
basic
principles
of
federalism
in
our
country.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
the
attorney
general
of
california
did
not
participate
in
this
case?
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
the
attorney
general
of
california
was
not
a
party
in
terms
of
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
in
the
lawsuit.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
see.
other
than
participation
as
an
amicus,
he
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
can
certainly
represent
to
your
honor
that
he
was
never
asked
to
participate
as
an
amicus,
so
i
would
not
want
there
to
be
any
inference
that
the
attorney
general
has
declined
to
participate
in
defense
of
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
but
the
subject
was
never
broached.
and
indeed,
we
have
never
had
any
contact
with
the
state
attorney
general.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
state
of
california
to
do
that,
no.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
would
think
so
as
well.
one
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
on
the
matter
that
we
were
discussing,
and
that
is
this,
that
we
also
feel
that
it
is
very
unlikely
that
these
differences
in
state
tax
laws
are
even
taken
into
account
by
congress
and
the
president
in
fashioning
tariffs,
as
was
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
relied
upon
by
respondent.
for
as
i
have
said,
when
we
have
some
states
that
impose
no
property
tax
at
all,
other
states
that
may
tax
at
a
high
rate,
other
states
that
have
different
exemptions
from
each
other,
it
seems
to
be
virtually
an
impossibility
for
congress
to
take
this
potpourri
of
laws
into
effect
in
fashioning
tariffs.
and
even
if
they
could
somehow
do
that,
since
there
are
changes
in
these
laws
from
time
to
time,
it
would
require
an
almost
constant
monitoring
by
congress
of
these
laws.
and
for
that
reason,
we
also
believe
that
this
abstraction
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
erroneous.
finally
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
exempting
goods
from
tax
we
know
is
within
the
purview
of
the
legislature
to
do,
as
new
york
has
done.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
because,
your
honor,
as
i
see
it,
the
reason
that
they
are
basing
this
entire
attack
on
the
statute
is
an
alleged
discrimination.
they've
contended
that
there
is
someone
against
whom
the
statute
works
in
a
discriminatory
way.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that
is
what
they're
saying.
but
we
know
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
correct.
but
we
know
that
in
cases
in
which
discrimination
is
the
basis
of
the
attack,
the
tests
enunciated
by
this
court
suggest,
as
the
court
did
in
first
federal
savings
&
loan
v.
the
state
tax
commission,
that
it
is
necessary
to
see
how
the
statute
operates
in
fact,
to
see
if
the
practical
effect
of
this
statute
is
to
create
a
competitive
handicap.
we
know
of
no
case
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
it
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
attack;
it's
an
attack
on
discrimination.
and
in
order
to
prove,
or
to
demonstrate
discrimination,
this
court
has
legitimately
held
that
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
the
statute
in
fact
creates
a
discriminatory
effect.
we
know
of
no
situation
in
which
the
effect
was
assumed
to
exist,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
our
case.
and
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
if
they
are
shipped
out
of
the
state
of
california
thereafter,
correct.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
right.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
pardon
me?
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
it
is
a
differential
in
treatment.
however,
in
order
to
have
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
on
discriminatory
grounds
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
--
the
statute
--
well,
you
have
to
show
if
discrimination
is
the
basis,
that
there
is
indeed
a
discriminated
class.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
my
use
of
the
term,
"injured
class,"
or
"discriminated
against
class,"
was
intended
to
mean
a
class
entitled
to
protection
under
those
cases,
and
under
the
doctrine
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
it
did.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
it
was.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
it
was
denied
on
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
your
honor,
i
think
when
you
perceive
it
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
the
standing
problem
that
we
see
is
that
the
argument
throughout
the
brief
of
the
respondent
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
i
think
it
really
exists
on
two
different
levels,
first
the
question
of
whether
the
progeny
of
the
state
can
attack
the
enactments
of
its
parent
at
all;
and
secondly,
even
if
it
can
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that
is
precisely
correct.
the
assessor
--
you
don't
have
one
of
those
situations
where
a
government
representative
is
being
told
personally
to
engage
in
an
act
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
it
got
into
the
courts
by
the
denial
--
after
the
denial
of
the
exemption.
sear,
roebuck
filed
suit
against
the
county
of
los
angeles
as
the
revenue
collection
agent,
not
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that's
correct.
in
some
states,
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
well,
the
assessor
is
the
tax
collector,
the
personal
tax
collector.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
that
is
correct,
and
precisely
for
that
reason,
you
do
not
come
within
those
cases
that
permit
an
individual
who
has
been
called
upon
to
perform
an
act
that
he
believes
is
unconstitutional
to
file
suit,
or
to
defend
suit
himself,
and
to
have
standing
to
do
so,
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
his
engaging
in
an
unconstitutional
act.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
i
see
it
as
a
standing
problem.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
reasoned
that
if
the
case
only
involved
an
equal
protection
question,
the
statute
would
be
valid,
because
it
has
a
rational
distinction.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
allied
stores
of
ohio
v.
bowers,
the
statute
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
went
further,
and
usually
hold
that
any
differentiation
between
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
is
unconstitutional
as
a
regulation
of
foreign
commerce
and
interstate
commerce.
now,
with
respect
to
cases
involving
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
traditional
history
of
the
clause
has
been
that
it
is
applied
to
invalidate
state
laws
that
are
used
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
as
a
means
of
favoring
local
economic
interests.
in
this
case,
california
taxed
local
goods
precisely
the
same
as
it
taxed
goods
traveling
in
interstate
commerce.
moreover,
it
did
not
use
discrimination
as
a
method
of
benefiting
local
economic
interests.
for
these
reasons,
the
boston
stock
exchange
case,
and
the
other
cases
relied
upon
by
respondents,
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
are
inapposite.
now
with
respect
to
the
concern
of
the
commerce
clause
as
to
the
foreign
power--foreign
commerce
power
of
congress,
the
concern
there
has
been
to
avoid
disruption,
to
avoid
interference
with
foreign
relations.
just
last
term
in
japan
line,
ltd.
v.
county
of
los
angeles,
this
case--this
court
struck
down
the
application
of
the
california
law
with
respect
to
the
taxation
of
foreign
instrumentalities
in
foreign
commerce.
there
we
had
a
situation
in
which
the
unfavorable
treatment
of
foreign
commerce
could
create
the
possibility
of
embarrassment
of
retaliation;
by
contrast,
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
have
a
statute
that
treats
foreign
goods
favorably,
and
does
not
result
in
any
potential
for
frustration
or
embarrassment
to
he
national
government.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
s.
garb
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
concerning
the
repeal
of
the
california
inventory
tax
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
continues
to
have
importance
to
california
taxpayers,
since
we
have
a
statute
which
was
in
effect
for
four
years,
and
we
have
a
four-year
period
within
which
to
bring
claims
for
refund
in
california.
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
of
great
importance
to
california
taxpayers.
in
addition,
since
the
respondents
have
taken
the
position
here
that
statutes
are
invalid
that
exempt
locally,
but
to
fail
to
exempt
locally
manufactured
goods,
as
respondents
have
now
argued,
and
have
argued
in
their
briefs,
since
none
of
the
other
36
states
that
have
free
port
laws
exempt
locally
manufactured
goods
sold
in
the
state,
the
outcome
of
the
constitutional
issue
asserted
by
respondents
in
this
case,
is
of
major
importance
to
the
statutes
of
those
other
36
states
as
well.
with
respect
to
this
pending
refund
statute,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
california
constitution
has
a
doctrine
that
prohibits
the
legislature
from
enacting
a
statute
which
constitutes
a
gift
of
public
funds.
and
in
a
long
series
of
cases,
dating
back
to
the
last
century,
cited
in
our
brief,
that
constitutional
provision
has
been
applied
with
respect
to
accrued
tax
liabilities.
for
that
reason
it
appears
very
likely
that
any
attempt
to
refund
taxes,
if
indeed
this
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
upheld,
would
violate
the
california
constitution.
i
am
advised
that
the
state
of
utah
had
a
similar
situation
in
which
a
refund
was
attempted
after
the
repeal
of
a
tax
law.
and
there,
as
well,
the
repeal
--
after
the
repeal,
the
refund
was
held
to
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
state.
i
would
like
to
move
for
a
moment
to
the
uniformity
argument
mentioned
by
respondents
in
oral
argument.
and
i
think
we
have
a
bit
of
confusion
here,
because
what
the
constitution
requires
is
uniformity
of
tariff
rates.
the
have
somehow
twisted
that
constitutional
requirement
of
uniform
tariff
rates
to
suggest
that
state
property
taxes
have
to
be
uniform.
and
yet
we
know
that,
even
though
we
have
uniform
tariff
rates,
we
have
different
state
property
tax
laws
that
obviously
are
going
to
have
a
different
impact
on
imported
goods
and
domestic
goods
as
well.
and
accordingly,
the
suggestion
that
there's
a
constitutional
requirement
of
uniformity
in
tariffs
simply
cannot
be
stretched
to
suggest
the
requirement
of
uniform
state
property
tax
laws.
next,
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
again
on
this
argument
that
section
225
constitutes
a
rebate
of
tariffs.
we're
already,
in
my
opening,
given
about
three
reasons
why
this
is
invalid,
and
a
fourth
one
comes
to
mind.
in
fact,
when
the
tariff
acts
that
counsel
has
now
stated
he
relies
upon
were
enacted,
goods
of
substantially
the
same
type
as
those
involved
in
this
case
were
immune
from
state
taxation
under
the
original
package
doctrine.
when
section
225
was
enacted,
it
preserved
the
nontaxable
status
of
these
very
goods;
and
accordingly,
when
congress
set
the
level
of
protection
that
it
intended
to
create
for
domestic
manufacturing,
that
same
level
of
protection
was
perpetuated
precisely
by
section
225.
so
for
that
reason
as
well,
the
major
premise
of
respondent's
argument
on
this
supposed
tariff
reduction
is
simply
erroneous.
and
as
i
listened
to
the
oral
arguments
of
respondents,
and
heard
the
extension
to
which
their
argument
is
now
taken,
that
the
commerce
clause
should
even
invalidate
state
laws
that
do
not
exempt
locally
manufactured
goods
sold
locally,
it
strikes,
me,
first
of
all,
that
that
runs
counter
to
allied
stores
of
ohio
v.
bowers,
which
validated
such
treatment
on
equal
protection
grounds;
and
alaska
v.
arctic
maid,
which
permitted
a
state
to
tax
locally
competing
industries
more
onerously
than
interstate
competing
industry.
but
in
addition,
it
probably
does
suggest,
as
mr.
justice
white
was
questioning
me
in
my
opening,
that
where
you
have
a
party
who
is
contending
--
a
tax
collecting
agent
who
is
contending
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
this
is
to
exempt
more
goods,
it
seems
very
likely
that
you
may
not
have
a
case
or
controversy
at
that
point.
thank
you
very
much.
