mr.
ernest
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
speaking
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
in
this
case,
we
believe
there
is
no
substantial
basis
for
a
constitutional
challenge
to
section
225
of
california's
revenue
and
taxation
code;
and
that
it
is
the
interest
of
the
united
states
that
it
be
sustained.
this
is
not
a
case,
as
many
cases
involving
state
taxation
that
have
come
to
this
court
are,
as
the
court
has
described
them,
cases
where
the
legitimate
interests
of
a
state--financial,
fiscal,
or
in
other
cases,
health--point
in
one
direction,
and
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
in
free
and
open
trade
points
in
another.
here,
they
coincide.
and
california,
perhaps
recognizing
that
great
cities
grow
and
develop
at
points
of
transshipment,
seeking
to
remove
obstacles
that
this
court
in
michelin
said
were
tolerable,
but
nevertheless,
burdens
to
some
extent;
seeking
to
remove
obstacles
that
new
york
removes,
the
first
port
of
the
country,
removes
by
statute,
in
providing
against
any
taxation
of
personal
property
on
an
ad
valorem
basis;
that
louisiana,
the
second
port
of
the
country
most
of
the
time,
gives
a
much
broader
exemption
even
than
california,
to
imported
goods.
california
moves
in
this
area
to
remove
this
obstacle.
now,
the
court
below
invoked
two
grounds,
one,
a
certain
inconsistency
which
it
asserted
with
the
tariff
laws;
with
respect
--
that
seems
almost
fanciful.
the
congress
is
certainly
aware
of
the
patchwork
of
state
property
tax
laws.
over
the
years,
their
non-uniformity
from
the
extreme
of
new
york
on
down.
and
of
the
rates.
if
the
tariff
laws
were
affected,
this
would
freeze
all
state
statutes.
rates
couldn't
be
changed;
exemptions
couldn't
be
changed
one
way
or
the
other.
more
than
that,
there's
really
no
correlation
between
tariff
statutes
and
these
annual
property
taxes.
the
tariff
is
imposed
on
all
goods,
dutiable
goods,
that
come
into
the
country.
property
taxes
may
or
may
not
affect
any
goods
that
come
in.
they
may
be
consumed
before
the
annual
tax
day,
which
varies
from
state
to
state.
they
may
run,
as
it
were,
a
slalom
course
around
--
between
the
property
taxes.
or
on
the
other
hand,
they
may
label
and
be
taxed
more
than
once.
but
there's
no
correlation
at
all.
and
as
i
say,
the
other
argument
would
require
that
these
be
frozen.
the
second
ground
asserted
by
the
state
is
discrimination
which
has
been
discussed.
and
discrimination
is
not
an
abstract.
and
if
we
assume
that
california
rather
than
an
interstate
shipper
can
invoke
this
--
statutes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
are
not
held
unconstitutional
in
the
abstract;
someone
who
is
hurt
usually
has
to
invoke
the
specific
grounds.
i
heard
something
in
the
argument
that
just
preceded
us
on
a
very
different
basis.
but
in
any
event
here,
during
a
hundred
years,
while
this
court
held
that
goods--imports
in
their
original
package
were
exempt
from
property
tax,
it
was
also
holding--in
fact,
for
four
years
before
low
v.
austin,
in
woodruff
v.
parham,
that
interstate
goods
in
their
original
package
were
not
exempt.
now,
i
can
hardly
believe
that
the
court,
having
formed,
perhaps
erroneously
as
it
has
recently
held,
an
exemption
for
interstate
goods
would
tolerate
this
discrimination
if
it
were
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
so
that
i
think
the
court
would
be
reluctant
to
impose
upon
its
predecessors
for
a
hundred
years
this
unconstitutional
--
not
erroneous,
but
unconstitutional
action.
moreover,
the
federal
statute
on
air
transportation
creates
the
same
differentiation.
it
taxes
interstate
air
transportation
and
domestic,
but
not
foreign.
so
we
have
a
parallel
in
congressional
action.
more
than
that,
this
court
has
frequently
--
and
as
pointed
out,
as
recently
as
last
term
in
japan
lines
--
pointed
out
the
preeminence
of
the
federal
interest
in
foreign
commerce,
while
nothing
that
the
control
of
interstate
commerce
is
more
a
matter
--
shared
with
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
and
this
differentiation
has
existed
throughout;
the
court
itself
in
a
number
of
instances
has
differentiated.
the
impact
of
the
21st
amendment
is
only
one
situation.
so
this
discrimination
--
i
prefer
to
say
differentiation
--
is
one
widely
recognized.
and
before
it
is
taken
as
a
basis
for
invalidating
action
that
parallels
the
federal
action
and
is
in
the
federal
interest,
it
should
be
shown,
we
believe,
to
have
adversely
affected
someone
who
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce;
not
someone
merely
who
would
seek
to
increase
the
revenues
of
a
county
as
opposed
to
the
action
of
that
state.
thank
you,
your
honors.
