mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has
been
told,
and
is
fully
informed
of
the
proceedings;
and
has
been
informed
of
those
proceedings
ever
since
this
case
arrived
at
the
court
of
appeals
below.
i
have
been
in
personal
contact
with
the
attorney
general,
the
state
board
of
equalization,
and
have
also
been
called
at
their
own
initiative
by
the
state
office
for
economic
development
and
international
trade.
i
have
explained
the
situation.
i
have
explained
my
position
on
this
particular
statute;
that
is,
the
respondent's
position
on
this
particular
statute.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
california
has
determined
to
take
no
action
with
regard
to
this
case.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
cannot
speak
for
the
attorney
general,
because
i
have
only
spoken
with
assistants
and
deputies.
and
my
telling
this
court,
your
honor,
that
mr.
dukmeijan
believes
one
way
or
the
other,
i
think
would
be
incorrect.
i
have
been
informally
involved
with
that,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
i
simply
said
that
i
was
in
contact,
and
they
were
aware
of
our
position.
they
have
indicated
to
me
informal
views
which
perhaps--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
i
just
didn't
talk
about
those,
because
they
are
not
the
position
of
the
office.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
true
insofar
as
the
state
statutes
are
concerned;
and
i
think
that
that
is
admitted
by
the
petitioners
here,
that
there
is
no
real
requirement
for
us
to
notify
the
state
attorney
general
that
this
statute
is
under
attack.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
parallel
statute--or,
not
a
parallel
statute,
but
there
is
a
statute
covering
the
parallel
situation
when
a
federal
statute
or
a
federal
enactment
is
under
attack
for
us
to
notify
the
attorney
general
or
solicitor
general.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor;
the
state
has
effectively
repealed
section
225;
it
is
not
effective
for
the
future.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
passed
the
senate,
and
it
is
now
the
in
the
state
assembly
revenue
and
taxation
committee.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
it
really
--
i
have
no
feel
for
that.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
your
honor,
we
--the
county's
position
is
that
we're
going
to
lose
money,
and
we
would
like
to
be
reimbursed
for
any
refunds
that
take
place.
because
the
way
the
statute
is
presently
worded,
the
counties
would
have
to
reimburse.
what
we'd
like
to
have
the
state
do
is
reimburse
it
through
their
general
fund,
rather
than
ours.
it's
a
matter
of
county
versus
state
kind
of
who
gives
the
money,
and
where
it
comes
from,
at
this
point.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
section
225,
the
statute
in
question,
has
been
repealed
effectively
by
the
enactment
of
an
overall
exemption,
which
exempts
all
inventory
from
taxation
in
the
state
of
california,
whether
it
comes
in
interstate
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--
or
foreign
commerce.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
questions.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
was
about
to
point
out,
in
terms
of
the
so-called
standing
issue,
the
case
arises,
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
this
court,
in
the
context
of
a
taxation
event
by
the
local
county.
we
made
this
taxation
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
could
have
a
narrow
interpretation,
and
that
the
goods
here
involved
ought
to
be
taxable.
one
of
our
positions
with
the
regard
to
that
interpretation
was
that
a
broad
interpretation
which
would
include
these
items
which
would
include
these
issues
would
run
into
constitutional
difficulties.
and
so
we
took
that
position,
made
the
tax;
were
in
turn
sued
for
a
refund
by
the
petitioners
here.
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
we
could
consider
the
constitutional
issue,
either
as
a
support
for
an
interpretation
or
by
itself,
if
one
were
to
take
automatically
the
broad
interpretation
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
assessor
was
a
party
to
this
action
in
superior
court,
and
we
stipulated
out
to
the
assessor's
presence.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
simply
because
it
was
the
county.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
named
a
former
assessor,
and
we
felt
that
rather
than
having
the
former
assessor's
name
on
because
of
certain
political
considerations,
we
thought
it
would
be
better
if
we
simply
had
it
in
the
entities
that
were
required
to
be
sued
by
statute.
i
should
point
out,
your
honor,
that
revenue
taxation
code
section
538,
which
was
described
in
our
response
to
a
petition
for
a
hearing
before
the
state
supreme
court,
has
been
enacted
by
the
legislature,
largely
in
response
to
the
section
--
to
this
problem.
and
that
section
reads
that
the
statute
charges
--
i'm
sorry,
the
section
charges
assessors
for
leaving
a
state
tax,
or
a
state
exemption,
to
be
unconstitutional,
quote
--
those
assessors
--
shall,
in
lieu
of
making
such
an
assessment
bring
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
against
the
state
board
of
equalization.
and
the
legislative
analyst,
in
describing
that
statute
for
the
legislature,
gave
exactly
the
same
rendition
of
the
assessor's
requirements
to
follow
the
constitution
as
the
court
of
appeals
did.
in
essence,
the
state
legislature
has
recognized
the
authority
of
the
county
to
bring
an
action
to
declare
invalid
under
the
constitution
a
state
exemption;
and
at
the
same
time,
recognized
the
previous
authority
of
the
assessor
to
render
the
assessment
in
view
of
his
own
belief,
as
the
constitutional
problem.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not
become
acquainted
with
that.
i
was
relying
on
board
of
education
v.
allen,
392
us
236,
which
involves
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
officer,
a
local
officer,
whose
duty
is
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
your
honor,
it
seemed
to
me
anomalous
to
--
on
the
fact
that
i
foolishly
stipulated
out
the
assessor's
name,
because
it
was
not
required
by
the
state
statute,
to
say
that
the
people
involved
do
not
have
standing
to
raise
constitutional
issues,
even
when
that
has
been
recognized
specifically
by
the
state
legislature,
which
i
recognize
that
you
are
telling
me
that
under
doremus
would
be
irrelevant.
but
my
feeling
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
whole
idea
of
the
board
of
education
v.
allen
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
when
the
officer
is
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution,
and
makes
that
decision,
that
i
believe
the
entity
which
is
sued
for
the
repayment
of
taxes,
and
certainly
there
are
individuals
involved,
and
certainly
the
assessor
is
going
to
comply
with
whatever
decision
comes
down,
and
the
tax
collector
and
all
the
other
individuals
involved
will
do
so
as
well;
that
they
are
so
intimately
wound
up,
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
determined,
with
the
entity
being
sued
itself,
that
the
entity
is
entitled
to
raise
that
particular
issue.
the
basic
issue
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
states
can
regulate
imports.
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
believe
this
to
be
improper.
we
believe
that
section
225
impinges
on
the
area
of
free
trade,
which
was
defined
by
this
court
in
boston
stock
exchange
v.
state
tax
commission.
we
believe
that
it
invades
the
area
of
the
federal
exclusive
right
to
regulate
imports,
not
only
to
insure
their
uniformity,
and--but
also
to,
as
this
court
said
in
board
of
trustees
v.
u.s.,
describe
the
extent
to
which
the
tariff
regulations
go;
that
precise
extent.
and
also,
225
we
believe
to
be
precluded
by
the
tariff
acts.
the
petitioner
suggests
different
issues,
in
essence.
he
suggests
that
there
are,
quote,
no
facts.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
petitioner's
request
that
this
statute
have
a
broad
interpretation;
and
yet
the
petitioner
seeks
to
avoid
the
ambit
of
that
broad
interpretation
as
described
and
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
first
answer
to
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
american
oil
applies,
pure
and
simple.
the
second
answer
is
that
there
are
facts
in
this
particular
case
which
show
that
section
225
yields
non-conformity
in
tariff
regulations.
goods
which
derive
from
the
same
manufacturer,
which
are
held
after
the
same
foreign
commerce,
and
which
are
held
in
the
same
warehouse,
but
which
are
eventually
sold
to
a
phoenix
customer,
are
treated
differently
for
their
temporary
storage
than
if
they
go
to
a
sacramento
customer.
225
tells
the
foreign
manufacturer,
"if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
sell
to
somebody
in
phoenix,
you're
in
great
shape.
but
if
you're
unlucky
enough
to
sell
to
somebody
in
sacramento,
you
lose.
i'm
sorry."
we
paint
this
picture
because
of
the
conditions
in
section
225,
which
reach
beyond
the
california
border,
and
encourage
and
discourage
certain
activities
in
foreign
countries,
and
in
other
states,
merely
on
the
basis
of
their
temporary
presence
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
on
the
export
side,
we
tell
a
pittsburgh
manufacturer
via
section
225
who
brings
his
goods
into
the
state
for
sale,
or
who
may
bring
those
goods
into
the
state,
or
who
is
thinking
about
bringing
those
goods
into
the
state,
that
if
he
sells
to
a
foreign
customer,
that's
fine;
he
will
not
be
taxed
on
the
basis
of
that
temporary
presence
in
the
state;
but
if
he
sells
to
an
hawaiian
customer,
he
loses.
section
225
thereby
creates
a
pricing
regulation
for
the
interstate
customer
of
foreign
and
interstate
goods,
and
also,
imposes
a
regulation
on
that
pittsburgh
manufacturer
who
is
thinking
of
bringing
of
his
goods
into
the
state
for
temporary
storage.
it
says,
in
essence,
we're
going
to
treat
these
things
separate
simply
because
it's
within
our
power
to
do
so.
now,
the
petitioners
have
suggested
that
this
is
all
saved
for
various
reasons.
they
suggest
that
they
can
avoid
the
appellate
court
finding,
because
the
appellate
court
finding
doesn't
apply
to
sears;
that
the
appellate
court
should
have
found
the
statute
constitutional
as
to
sears,
but
unconstitutional
as
to
z
toys,
because
z
toys
did
have
the
facts
with
regard
to
distribution.
this
case
was
consolidated
below
without
objection,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
ambit
of
the
statute--and
defined
it.
now
the
petitioner
seeks
to
avoid
that
ambit,
even
though
it
asserted
that
it
could
go
forward
with
the
broad
interpretation.
the
idea,
then,
of
validating
section
225
because
it
prefers
foreign
goods
over
interstate
goods,
is
to
my
way
of
thinking,
equally
invalid.
it
is
invalid
because
section
225
distinguishes
between
foreign
goods;
it
does
not
even
support
all
foreign
goods.
any
product
which
is
brought
into
the
state
of
california
from
japan,
which
is
quote
manufactured,
and
i
respectfully
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
definition
of
manufacturing,
or
the
exemption--
or
the
exception
to
the
definition
of
manufacturing
in
section
225,
which
in
essence
states
that
if
you
can
label
those
goods
in
california,
and
they
will
not
be
taxable,
but
you
paint
them
and
they
will
be
taxable,
even
though
they
arrive
at
the
same
interstate
customer's
location;
even
though
they
are
produced
in
the
beginning
by
the
same
foreign
manufacturer;
and
even
though
they
are
brought
into
the
state
by
the
same
method
of
transportation.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
these
goods,
your
honor,
have
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
your
honor,
the
particular
goods
which
are
the
subject
of
the
stipulation
involve
two
classes
of
goods.
one
class
were
those
that
were
brought
in
from
a
foreign
manufacturer,
held
in
the
state,
and
eventually
sold
to
foreign
customers
--
not
foreign
customers,
but
customers
out
of
state.
the
other
class
of
goods,
which
the
petitioner
does
not
claim
the
exemption
for,
are
a
class
of
goods
which
were
brought
into
the
state
from
foreign
manufacturers
and
held
in
los
angeles,
but
for
a
sacramento
shipment.
and
at
that
particular
time,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
did
not
even
know
whether
or
not
those
goods
were
going
to
be
sold
to
that
sacramento
customer,
or
to
the
arizona
customer.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
transshipped
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
california
manufacturers--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
it
distinguishes
between
them,
and
it
also
distinguishes
between
the
in-state--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
i
think
that's
one
of
the
vices
of
it,
because
it
makes
the
tariffs--in
essence,
it
gives
a
tariff
rebate
to
one
set
of
foreign
goods
and
doesn't
give
it
to
another.
and
i
think
that
can
be
reached
from
the
stipulated
facts.
if
american
oil
does
not
apply,
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
seen
in
and
of
itself
--
that
these
extra-territorial
conditions
are
not
seen
in
and
of
themselves
as
an
invasion
of
free
trade
(boston
stock
exchange),
and
if
it
is
not
seen
as
a
deprivation
of
the
federal
government's
right
to
regulate
imports
(board
of
trustees
v.
illinois),
and
if
it
is
not
seen
as
a
conflict
with
the
tariff
acts,
then
the
stipulated
facts
do
support
the
distinction
that
is
made
between
foreign
goods,
which
makes
them
un-uniform,
which
is
contrary
to
the
tariff
act.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there's
a
specific
section
which
requires
uniformity
of
tariffs.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
one
way
suggest,
as
the
federal
government
has
suggested
here,
that
because
the
federal
government's
current
policy
is
to
help
certain
foreign
interests,
that
is,
the
airplane
flights,
that
suddenly
all
states
can
enact
this
same
kind
of
exemption
that
cuts
across
these
same
lines.
what
that
does
is
effectively
open
the
doors
to
any
interest
groups
supporting
foreign
manufacturers,
and
close
them
to
our
own
domestic
manufacturers,
because
the
solicitor
general
has
also
suggested
that
any
regulation
which
hurts
foreign
commerce
is
a
bad
thing.
we
can't
do
that,
i
think,
and
still
retain
the
kind
of
ability
that
this
country
has
to
have
a
system
which
is
uniform,
a
system
which
operates
on
perhaps
the
kinds
of
goods
differently;
that
is,
if
we
say
we
have
a
timber
exemption,
or
a
different
rate
for
cattle,
as
wisconsin
does
for
different
kinds
of
goods,
those
statutes
on
their
face
do
not
cut
across
these
lines.
but
section
225,
and
its
extra-territorial
conditions,
do.
on
its
face,
in
the
context
of
article
xiii,
section
1,
of
the
state
constitution,
which
requires
all
property
in
the
state
to
be
taxed,
those
selective
encouragements
and
discouragements
of
foreign
and
interstate
activity
operate
as
inhibitions.
and
i
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
footnote
13
of
the
boston
stock
exchange
opinion,
which
talk
about
those
particular
kinds
of
inhibiting
effects
of
state
taxes.
the
language
itself
of
this
statute
directs--actually
cuts
against
the
federal
government's
ability
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
tariff
regulations
act.
are
we
assume
--
is
one
to
assume,
i
ask
rhetorically
--
whether
--
that
the
federal
government,
once
a
tariff
is
imposed,
simply
lets
it
go?
that
the
regulation
does
not
go
into
effect?
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
believe
that
the
exemption
by
its
own
conditions,
and
referring
to
the
tariff
act
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
in
essence
mandates
almost
as
broadly
as
the
tariff
acts
themselves,
a
rebate
of
tariffs
which
have
been
paid,
insofar
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
distinction
between
interstate
and
foreign
goods.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
believe
they
do,
your
honor,
although
i'm
not
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
if
any
i
may,
your
honor,
for
just
a
moment.
the
basis
for
the
argument
that
the
federal
government
has
made
here,
that
the
inconsistency
--
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
with
the
tariff
laws,
is
that
the
congress
is
aware
of
the
patchwork
of
state
taxation,
and
congress
would
have
acted
if
they
didn't;
and
the
court
was
directed
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
your
honor,
they
do
that
on
the
basis
that
i
have
stated.
they
say
--
first
of
all,
they
say
there
is
no
inconsistency.
then
they
say,
congress
would
have
acted
if
there
were.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
used
that
second
argument
as
a
support
for
the
first.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
the
commerce
clause
itself
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
not
necessarily
with
a
burden,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
true,
and
also,
your
honor,
that
because
it
effectively
rebates
tariffs
in
an
area
where
the
president
is
empowered
to
protect
domestic
goods,
that
it
takes
away
from
the
presidential
power
to
protect
those
goods.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i'm
sorry.
i
was
trying
to
separate
out,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
idea
of
a
specific
conflict
with
the
tariff
acts,
and
the
exclusive
right
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
imports.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
yes,
sir.
although
i
do
believe
the
exclusivity
argument
is
also
under
the
commerce
clause
area.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
we
believe
that
boston
stock
exchange
applies
here.
we
believe
that
because
it
cuts
against
the
types
of
commerce;
it
cuts
between
types
of
foreign
commerce;
between
types
of
interstate
commerce,
particularly
on
the
export
side;
and
between
foreign
and
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
did
dwell
on
that
particular
point.
during
oral
argument,
we
attempted
--
or
the
petitioner
attempted
to
deal
with
the
export
side,
and
the
justice
which
was
basically
the
author
of
the
opinion
said
that
he
felt
that
it
would
be
clearer
if
they
went
for
one
particular
side
of
the
issue.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
i
think
that
the
third
issue
that
is
raised
by
the
petitioners
here,
and
also
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
the
statutes
of
other
states
have
the
effect
of
validating
section
225.
this,
of
course,
is
i
think
improper.
austin
v.
new
hampshire,
420
us
656,
i
think
stands
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
will
not
take
another
state's
statutes,
another
state's
statute,
and
attempt
to
validate
a
first
state's
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
other
one
exists
or
is
interpreted
in
any
particular
way.
in
fact,
these
other
state
statutes
show
how
the
job
can
be
done
with
less
impact
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
these
other
states
--
the
new
york
statute
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
louisiana
statutes
that
were
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
eight
statutes
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
--
show
how
the
extra-territorial
effect
can
be
avoided;
that
is,
the
way
that
california
eventually
determined
that
it
would
be
avoided;
that
is,
by
exempting
all
inventories
or
all
personal
property
in
the
jurisdiction.
california's
new
exemption
does
not
create
the
selective
barriers;
does
not
present
the
picture
to
the
interstate
manufacturer.
it's
the
foreign
manufacturer
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
that
it
does
not
create
the
foreign-interstate
distinction.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
i
think
that
one
of
our
arguments,
mr.
justice
white,
is
the
idea
that
those
kinds
of
statutes
do
not
create
the
same
degree
of
problems
that
section
225.
and
yes,
there
are
a
whole
string
of
statutes
which
raise
from
225
over
here
on
the
left
side,
as
showing
the
foreign-interstate
dichotomy,
to
the
eight
statutes
that
we
presented
in
our
brief
which,
in
effect,
only
tax
goods
which
are
being
shipped
from
one
point
in
the
state
to
another
point
in
the
state;
and
down
to
the
louisiana,
new
york
statutes.
yes
there
is
a
spectrum;
and
yes,
there
is
a
spectrum
of
burden.
our
position
is
that
225,
because
it
was
practically
everything
and
does
it
the
wrong
way,
is
improper
and
unconstitutional.
we
take
the
position
that
section
225
reaches
out
beyond
the
state
borders
like
none
of
these
other
statutes
do,
and
encourage
between
out-of-state
activity.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
no,
your
honor,
because
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
determination
--
we
agree
that
that
is
one
of
the
issues;
and
we
agree
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
court
of
appeals
determined
the
ambit
of
the
statute
as
creating
a
distinction
between
foreign
and
interstate
goods.
that
statute
was
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
which
is
not
my
client,
right.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
right,
your
honor.
and
we
did
that
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
on
the
basis
of
those
particular
goods
and
those
particular
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
and
we
believe
that
that
ambit
is
improper,
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
was
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--
decision
that
when
those
goods
go
out
of
state
as
well;
in
other
words,
when
we
have
an
interstate
shipment,
and
a
foreign
commerce
--
and
a
foreign
shipment,
which
eventually
go
out
of
state,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
225
operates
to
distinguish
between
those
two;
that
in
essence
it
distinguishes
between
those
two
branches
of
commerce;
that
distinguishing
between
those
two
branches
of
commerce
is
improper;
and
that
that,
we
believe,
is
supported
by
american
oil,
and
by
the
idea
that
the
court
of
appeals
made,
as
part
of
the
broad
interpretation
which
was
supported
and
urged
by
the
petitioner,
that
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
really
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
thought
--
before
the
court
of
appeal,
your
honor,
there
were
facts
that
that
interstate
commerce
did
exist;
that
interstate
commerce
is
being
brought
through
the
state
for
distribution
purposes
to
other
states.
and
that
was
part
of
the
z
toys
facts
which
were
consolidated
with
this
case
without
objection.
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
facts
contrary
to
petitioner's
assertion
that
they
have
no
facts.
they
had
facts
with
regard
to
that
interstate
shipment,
the
same
facts,
in
essence,
that
we
show
by
our
appendix
b;
that
in
essence,
there
are
goods
which
are
brought
into
the
state
from
other
states
for
regional
distribution.
thank
you.
