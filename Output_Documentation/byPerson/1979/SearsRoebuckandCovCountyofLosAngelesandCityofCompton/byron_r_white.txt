justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
not
an
article
iii
question,
you
know.
is
it
a
prudential--that
the
county
just
shouldn't
be
able
to
assert
a
constitutional
issue,
even
though
there's
a
perfectly
good
case
or
controversy
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
tax
assessor
says,
"i
take
an
oath
to
observe
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
too."
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
who
is
on
the
other
side
when
--
how
did
this
case
get
started?
how
did
it
get
into
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
else
would
they
have
sued?
nobody.
that's
the
procedure
that's
provided.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
--
that
is
the
tax
collector.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
that
isn't
--
apparently,
under
state
law,
you
don't
sue
the
assessor,
you
sue
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you
for
a
minute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
california
courts
saw
no
problem
with
your
taking
the
position
you
do
and
mitigating
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
county
is
the
state's
assessing
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
all
that
were
true.
what
about
these
goods?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
argument,
then,
domestically
--
assume
that
the
city
--
assume
that
cook
county
in
chicago
said,
we
tax
inventories
that
are
located
here
on
a
certain
date,
except
the
following,
and
one
of
them
they
list
is,
inventories
(inaudible)
are
here
that
have
come
from
out
of
state
and
are
going
to
be
shipped
out
within
two
weeks,
or--goods
that
are
destined
to
go
elsewhere
out
of
the
state.
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
was
a
burden
on
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
certainly
creates
a
distinction
between
goods
from
out
of
state
that
are
going
to
be
shipped
--
that
are
going
to
be
sold
locally,
and
goods
that
are
going
to
be
transshipped.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
certainly
one
of
your
arguments.
that
certainly
is
one
of
your
arguments
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you've
got
to
argue
in
this
case
that
the
exemption
is
invalid
because
of
the
goods
--
sears
goods
that
are
shipped
out
of
the
state,
or
exempt
under
this
exemption,
and
the
ones
that
are
destined
for
sacramento
are
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
the
only
goods
that
are
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
--
is
there
any
broader
issue
here?
because
these
are
the
only
goods
that
are
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
your
client.
