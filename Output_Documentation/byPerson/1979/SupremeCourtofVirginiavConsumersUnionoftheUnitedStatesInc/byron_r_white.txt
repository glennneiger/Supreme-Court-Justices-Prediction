justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
happened
to--
was
there
a
damages
claim
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
i
suppose
if
--
i
suppose
that
if
you
win,
they
could
have
and
would
--
and
should
be
entitled
to
damages
under
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
attorney's
fees
for
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
r
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
got
sopped
by
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
i
suppo
--
and
i
think
you
say
that
--
and
you
say
that
action,
on
judicial
capacity,
a
judge
is
immune
for,
at
least
from
damages
--
for
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
in
a
house
report,
not
in
the
statute,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
administrative
acts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
let's
just
assume
the
virginia
supreme
court
decides
the
case
that
your
clients
were
involved
in
and
you
happen
to
think
it's
--
it
had
been
decided
wrong
under
the
federal
constitution
and,
the
su
--
that
supreme
court
ordered
some
relief
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
go
into
a
three-judge
court
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
get
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
to
justice
rehnquist
you
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be.
so,
your
answer
to
the
question
is,
no,
the
three-judge
court
does
not
have
reviewing
authority
over
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
virginia
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
where
there's
a
right
to
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
there's
a
decision
in
the
virginia
trial
court
against
your
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
there's
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
virginia
supreme
court,
you
don't
appeal
and
you
come
to
the
three-judge
court.
you
want
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
res
judicata?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
stops
there.
it
didn't
go
up
to
the
highest
court,
but
it's
been
finally
decided
in
the
virginia
supreme
--
virginia
court
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
doc
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
doctrine
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
really
your
answer,
isn't
it?
that's
your
basic
submission
that
this
is
an
administrative
act,
not
a
judicial
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there's
no
question
of
judicial
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
quite
the
contrary,
just
the
contrary,
just
three
minutes
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
performed
a
judicial
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
finally.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
you
going
to
go
into
a
three-judge
court
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
wha
--
on
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
that's
not
your
strongest
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
ju
–
i
--
didn't
you
just
attack
these
rules
on
their
face,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
this
rule
that
you've
passed
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
had
either
inherent
or
delegated
power
from
the
legislature
or
from
the
vir
--
state
constitution
to
pass
these
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
had
a
brand
of
legislative
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
be,
but
you
do
say
that
these
weren't
judicial
acts.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
were
something.
what
do
you
say
they
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
administrative,
they
made
some
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
part
of
the
administration
--
administrative?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
--
suppose
the
congress
passes
a
law
and
you
sued
all
100
senators,
for
example,
for
having
passed
an
unconstitutional
act
which
you
claim
is
unconstitutional.
would
they
have
immunity
from
defending
that
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
one
easy
way
of
--
one
certainly
surefire
way
of
raising
the
validity
of
the
rule
is
if
the
virginia
court
moved
against
somebody
to
enforce
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
let's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
supreme
court
was
enforcing
the
rule
against
some
lawyer.
he
could
certainly
raise
then
the
constitutionality
of
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
resist
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
suppose,
he
--
i
suppose,
if
he
want,
he
could
get
attorney's
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
moved
against
a
particular
lawyer
for
violating
one
of
its
rules
and
the
lawyer
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
rule
is
unconstitutional.
he
lost,
the
final
judgment
against
him
in
the
virginia
supreme
court.
then,
your
organization
brings
a
suit
against
the
individual
justices
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
an
injunction.
you
sue
in
the
federal
court
asking
that
those
judges
be
enjoined
from
deciding
cases
that
way
because
they're
wrong.
could
--
would
those
judges
--
would
they
be
immune
from
that
kind
of
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
say
we
want
–
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
rules
are
unconstitutional
and,
therefore,
you
must
not
decide
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is.
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
submits
it's
--
it
issued
a
final
judgment
that
the
fellow
violated
the
rule.
now,
can
you
su
--
are
they
immune
then
in
your
suit
in
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
make
the
same
claim
as
you
do
here.
judge
--
you
just
upheld
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
rule
of
yours
and
you're
wrong.
we're
going
to
enjoin
--
we're
going
to
enjoin
you
from
deciding
cases
like
that
anymore.
