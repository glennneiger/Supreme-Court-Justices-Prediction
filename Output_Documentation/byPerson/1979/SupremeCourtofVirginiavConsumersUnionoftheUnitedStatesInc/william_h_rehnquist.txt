justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
concede,
general
coleman,
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
is
a
person
under
1983?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
talking
about
judicial
immunity.
i
thought
that
immunity
was
a
defense
that
one
raised.
i
think,
in
order
to
have
a
lawsuit
under
1983,
you
have
to
show
that
the
person
you
are
suing
is
a
person
for
purposes
of
1983
as
defined
by
congress
under
monell
and
related
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
broadman,
i
take
it,
you
do
contend
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
as
an
entity,
is
a
person
under
section
1983
and
1941?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
that
you
had
sued
just
as
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
as
an
entity,
is
a
person
within
1983?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
judge
stump,
i
take
it,
in
stump
against
sparkman,
would
have
been
liable
for
attorney's
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
rely
on
if
a
--
other
than
the
citation
to
the
string
of
cases
in
the
committee
report
that
the
congress,
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
act,
intended
to
at
--
abolish
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
act
itself
that
suggests
that
persons
who
have
had
immunity
in
the
past
should
be
liable
for
attorney's
fees,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
until
--
people
who
have
had,
say,
a
judicial
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
pierson
against
ray,
for
example,
broke
it
down
that
way.
they
just
said
the
judges
have
been
traditionally
immune.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
three-judge
district
court
has
review
authority
over
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
call
it
a
legislative
act
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
tenney
against
brandhove?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
su
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
have
a
case
like
the
chief
justice
wrote
in
1970
or
1971
involving
the
rapley
proceedings
in
the
wisconsin
legislature
where
there
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
rules
bringing
somebody
before
the
bar
of
the
legislature
and
asking
them
questions
or
ordering
them
confined
until
the
end
of
the
session.
would
you
say
that
was
a
legislative
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
telling
him
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
either
desist
from
certain
conduct
or
--
i
don't
remember
the
particular
facts,
but
it
was
an
action
of
the
legislature
enforcing
its
own
rules.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
your
characterization,
if
this
is
administrative
ver
--
and
not
judicial
and
not
legislative,
is
that
motivated
in
any
way
by
our
cases
of
pierson
against
ray
and
tenney
against
brandhove
and
butz
versus
economou?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
virginia
legislature
had
passed
exactly
this
same
set
of
standards
governing
lawyer
conduct
in
the
state.
could
you
sue
the
members
of
the
virginia
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
going
to
get
just
straight
out.
if
we
agree
with
you
this
is
an
administrative
action
by
the
court
and
there's
no
immunity,
therefore
--
then
you
can
get
attorneys'
fees,
you
could
also
get
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
no
judicial
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
administrative
--
the
standards
for
administrative
would
apply.
