justice
thurgood

couldn't
he
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
couldn't
he
sue
each
one
of
them
officially
as
you
did
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
sued
each
one
of
these
judges,
you
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
their
official
capacity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
okay.
well,
why
couldn't
you
sue
each
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
“in
his
official
capacity”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
the
court
a
person
and
can't
make
the
legislature
a
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
broadman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
back
up
a
minute.
you
asked
lawyers
to
take
legal
action
on
this
on
their
own
and
they
refused
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
suppose
they
did
advertise
in
your
directory
and
they
were
ordered
to
be
disbarred,
and
they
sued
the
supreme
court
that
disbarred
them;
one,
could
they
sue
the
supreme
court
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
that's
involved
is
the
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
my
case
is
he
had
been
disbarred.
the
question
is
can
you
sue
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
virginia
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
lawyer,
he
can't
sue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
number
two,
therefore,
he
can't
get
counsel
fees.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
it
so
happen
that
you
can?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
he
goes
into
the
united
states
district
court
of
virginia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
reason
he
can't
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
comity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
have
filed
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
have
filed
an
action
in
the
district
court
originally
before
he
was
disbarred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
new
question
is
he
wasn't
disbarred.
he
heard
he
was
about
to
be
disbarred.
so,
he
went
into
the
district
court
and
asked
for
everything
-
damages,
injunction,
declaratory
judgment,
and
that
all
things
they
used
to
have,
enact
the
procedure,
anything
else
the
court,
out
of
its
good
heart,
would
give
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
was
would
he
--
win
or
lose,
would
he
get
counsel
fees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
win
or
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
wins,
he
gets
counsel
fees.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
that
--
aren't
you
asking
us
the
only
door
where
anybody
can
do
what
a
lawyer
can't
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
comity
doesn't
apply
to
you.
