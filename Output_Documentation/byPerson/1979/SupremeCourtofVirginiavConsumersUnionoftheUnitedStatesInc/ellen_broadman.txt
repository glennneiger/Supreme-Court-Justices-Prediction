ms.
ellen
broadman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
virginia
supreme
court's
disciplinary
rule
which
was
at
issue
in
this
case
is,
without
question,
unconstitutional.
although
the
virginia
supreme
court
now
concedes
this
fact,
it
claims
that
it
is
immune
from
the
underlying
action
in
this
case
and
claims
immunities
that
would
leave
the
public
defenseless
against
its
future
incursions
on
constitutionally
protected
rights.
here,
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
feel
that
this
court
does
not
need
to
reach
that
question
because
we
did
name
the
chief
justice
in
his
official
capacity
as
a
defendant,
so
that
we
clearly
do
have
a
defendant
who
is
a
person
within
meaning
of
1983.
it's
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
he
was
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
it
was
the
court
but
he
is
a
member
of
the
court.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
he's
certainly
not
all
of
them.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
when
we
refer
to
the
virginia
supreme
court,
we
intended
to
refer
to
each
of
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
in
their
official
capacity,
so
when
we
refer
to
it
as
an
entity,
we're
really
referring
to
each
of
the
individual
justices
in
their
official
capacity
and
they
are
persons.
so
that,
as
an
entity,
we
would
argue
that
they
are
persons
for
purposes
of
the
1983.
here,
the
consumer
groups'
only
means
to
protect
their
first
amendment
freedoms
was
to
institute
this
action.
the
disciplinary
rule
at
issue
here
prohibited
attorneys
from
participating
in
an
attorney
directory
that
the
consumer
groups
wanted
to
publish
to
educate
the
public
about
available
legal
services.
here,
the
consumer
groups
could
not
appeal
that
rule
in
order
to
protect
their
first
amendment
freedoms.
they
could
not
publish
that
directory
and
challenge
the
disci
--
challenge
the
unconstitutional
rule
through
disciplinary
proceedings.
their
only
recourse
was
to
bring
this
action
under
1983.
the
consumer
groups
here
needed
to
join
the
virginia
supreme
court
as
a
party
in
order
to
obtain
complete
relief
against
all
entities
who
had
authority
to
enforce
the
rule
against
attorneys
who
participated
in
the
directory.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no.
the
consumer
groups
here
did
not
seek
damages.
they
solely
sought--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
this
court
characterizes
the
issuance
and
enforcing
of
the
disciplinary
rules
as
judicial
or
as
administrative
in
nature.
if
they
are
judicial
acts,
it's
our
contention
that
judicial
immunity
would
protect
the
court
from
any
damage
claim.
however,
it
would
not
protect
the
court
from
prospective
relief
from
declaratory
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
--
and
injunctive
relief
that
protects
rights
in
the
future.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
it's
our
contention
that
hutto
v.
finney
establishes
that
the
attorney
fee
award
in
this
case
is
correct.
the
award
upheld
by
this
court
in
hutto
is
identical
in
all
significant
respects
to
the
award
that
is
now
before
the
court.
both
awards
were
granted
against
the
state
officers
in
their
official
capacity
to
be
paid
from
state
funds.
congress,
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act
intended
to
make
reimbursement
available
from
state
funds
where
parties
were
forced
to
bring
suit
and
forced
to
incur
litigation
expenses
in
order
to
vindicate
their
rights
from
--
against
infringement
by
the
states.
and,
congress
intended
that
where
governmental
immunities
did
not
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
not
damages,
no,
attorney's
fees.
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act
does
not
authorize
damages.
ms.
ellen
broadman
if
the
parties
had
won
on
the--
had
obtained
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
yes.
then,
they
would
be
entitled,
under
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act,
to
damages
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
to
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
there,
the
court
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
there's
an
enormous
body
of
case
law
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
--
that
holds
that
judges
are
immune
from
damage
liability.
ms.
ellen
broadman
however,
damages
are
very
different
than
attorney's
fee.
in
hutto
v.
finney,
the
court
recognized
that
distinction
and,
moreover,
congress,
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act,
merely
intended
to
abrogate
any
immunities
that
might
preclude
a
fee
award.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
this
language
in
the
senate
report
that
was
cited
in
hutto
v.
finney
in
which
the
senate
recognizes
that,
in
this
case,
the
state
officers
usually
wi
--
or
often
will
be
the
defendants
and
that,
in
order
to
assure
that
parties
can
protect
their
constitutional
rights
from
infringement,
congress
intends
to
provide
for
reimbursement
from
state
funds.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
well,
the
statute
authorizes
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
judicial
immunity
from
prospective
relief?
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
pierson
v.
ray
was
a
damages
case,
as
was
stump
versus
sparkman.
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act
authorizes
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
costs.
so,
the
statute
and
cost
traditionally
have
been
awarded
from
state
funds,
so
that
the
statutory
language
does
provide
for
attorney's
fees
from
state
funds.
and
then,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
generally
says
that
congress
intends
to
make
fee
awards
available
against
state
officers
in
their
official
capacity
from
state
funds,
and
the
house
report
has
a
specific
reference
to
pierson
v.
ray,
a
judicial
immunity
case,
and
specifically
says
this
is
one
of
several
immunities
that
we
do
not
intend
to
preclude
fee
awards
in
these
cases.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
that's
in
the
house
report.
it's
in
the
legislative
history.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
the
virginia
supreme
court
now
concedes
that
its
rule
was
unconstitutional--
ms.
ellen
broadman
and
it's
the
tenth
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
the
virginia
supreme
court--
ms.
ellen
broadman
the
sup--
well,
the
virgi--
ms.
ellen
broadman
could
it?
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
they
could
not
under
tenney
versus
brandhove.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
here
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
each
one
of
the
legislators?
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
no.
tenney
versus
brandhove
seem
to
suggest
that--
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
legislative
immunity
protects
legislators
from
suits
that
attempt
to
interfere
with
their
speeches
and
debates,
so
that,
if
we
try
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
that's
--
yes,
that's
a
separate
issue.
ms.
ellen
broadman
right.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
no.
i
think
you
could
sue
the
le
--
i
think
the
legislature,
individually,
would
be
a
person
but
legislative
immunity
would
preclude
the
suit.
ms.
ellen
broadman
here
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
attempting
to
defeat
that
judgment
in
order
to
defeat
the
fee
award
here.
it's
claiming
that
judicial
immunity
precludes
the
consumer
groups
from
getting
prospective
relief
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
from
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
ms.
ellen
broadman
they
are
attempting
to
defeat
that,
but
solely
to
defeat
the
fee
award.
never
during
the
five
year
--
four
years
of
litigation
that
proceeded
that
granting
of
the
fee
award
did
the
virginia
supreme
court
ever
claimed
that
legislative
or
judicial
immunity
precluded
them
from
the
underlying
action,
protect
it,
immunizes
that
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
they
never
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
ms.
ellen
broadman
they
never
raised
those.
ms.
ellen
broadman
and,
in
fact,
judicial
immunity
does
not
preclude
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
prospective
relief
from
constitutional
wrongs.
the
purposes
for
the
judicial
immunity
doctrine
do
not
apply
here.
suits
for
prospective
relief
from
unconstitutional
acts
are
analogous
to
appeals,
in
that
they
merely
ask
a
court
with
review
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
another
court
has
properly
applied
the
law.
ms.
ellen
broadman
under
1983,
the
three-judge
district
court
does
have
authority
to
issue
prospective
relief
from
unconstitutional
acts
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
that's
--
well,
either
judicial
or
administrative.
it's
our
contention
that,
here,
the
acts
are
not
judicial
in
nature,
in
that,
they
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no.
that's
a
very
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
in
that
situation,
the
reason
you
could
not
do
that
is
not
because
of
judicial
immunity,
but
because
of
the
doctrines
of
comity
and
res
judicata.
ms.
ellen
broadman
where
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
--
where
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
from
an
unconstitutional
act,
no.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
the
situation
that
we
posit,
where
the
highest
court
of
the
state
rules
against
my
client,
there's
a
right
to
appeal
to
this
court
in
order
to
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes?
ms.
ellen
broadman
there,
also,
the
three-judge
district
court
should
not
hear
that
case
because
of
doctrines
of
comity.
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
and--
well,
if
it
went
up
to
the
highest
court,
then
it
would
be
res
judicata.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
their
doctrines
of
comity
would
prevent
a
party
from
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
circumvented
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
there
are
basic
rights
to
appeal.
where
a
judge
enters
a
decision
where
there's
a
right
to
appeal,
that
party
must
take
that
appeal
if
the
appeal
is
adequate
because,
other
--
told
otherwise,
will
completely
disrupt
our
systems
of
appeal.
however,
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
here
because
there
was
no
right
to
appeal.
the
act
here
was
not
a
judicial
act.
it
shares
none
of
the
characteristics
of
judicial
immunity.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
okay,
that
is
one
reason
that
we're
saying
judicial
immunity
does
not
apply.
the
second
reason
is
that
judicial
immunity
does
not
preclude
suits
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
so
that
the
parties
are
entitled
to
prevail
on
the
underlying
action
and,
therefore,
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
let
me
try
and
clarify.
what
i'm
say
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
it
would
depend.
ms.
ellen
broadman
whether
there
was
a
right
to
appeal.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay.
well,
where
there
are
appellant
processes
that
a
party
sh
--
party
can
follow,
doctrines
of
comity
would
prevent
that
party
from
circumventing
those
by
going
and
suing
a
court
in
a
three-judge
district
court
rather
than
following
the
appeals.
so,
basically,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
judicial
immunity
there
would
not
prevent
the
party
from
bringing
action
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
let
me
go
on
to
the
administrative
act
or
the
non-judicial
act
argument.
here,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
judicial
act
at
issue
because
none
of
the
characteristics
typical
of
judicial
acts
exists.
the
virginia
supreme
court,
in
issuing
its
rules,
is
not
resolving
cases
and
controversies
between
the
parties
by
applying
relevant
laws.
the
court
is
not
bound
by
case
precedent
in
issuing
its
disciplinary
rules
and
there's
no
right
to
appeal.
none
of
the
characteristics
typical
of
judicial
acts
apply
here.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
we
would
not
call
it
legislative.
ms.
ellen
broadman
the
legislature
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
because,
here,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
authority
to
enforce
the
rules.
it
has
enf
--
authority
to
enforce
the
rules
independently
of
the
state
bar
association.
it
has
inherent
authority
to
enforce
the
rules
and
it
also
has
express
statutory
authority
under
the
virginia
code
section
5474.
that
section
authorizes
the
virginia
court
to
bring
a
disciplinary
action
whenever
it
observes
an
attorney
engaging
in
unethical
conduct.
we
brought
this
action
against
the
virginia
court
in
its
enforcement
capacity.
ms.
ellen
broadman
legislative
immunity
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
case.
they
are
basically
just
asking
the
state
bar
association
for
opinions?
ms.
ellen
broadman
or
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
as
far
as
where
the
legislature
starts
enforcing
the
rules,
the
purposes
for
legislative
immunity
no
longer
apply.
legislative
immunity
is
intended
to
protect
legislators'
speeches
and
debates
from
interference
by
the
executive
or
judicial
branch.
the
le
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
enforcing
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
enforcing
their
own
proceedings
is
somewhat
different
than
enforcing
their
own
--
the
laws
that
they
issue.
at
the
point
where
the
legislature
starts
enforcing
laws
that
it
issues,
it's
no
longer
acting
in
--
within
a
legislative
capacity.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that
is
a
legislative
act
because
it's
inherently
involved
in
permitting
them
to
freely
speak
if
they
gather
information
in
order
to
pass
laws.
and,
that
whole
process
through
which
laws
are
passed
is
protected
by
legislative
immunity.
but,
once
a
law
is
passed,
the
minute
the
legislature
assumes
responsibility
for
enforcement,
typically
it's
not
the
legislature
that
enforces.
legislative
immunity
no
longer
applies.
you're
no
longer
within
the
legislative
realm.
it
would
be
wholly
contrary
to
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
ex
parte
versus
young,
100
years
ago,
to
apply
legislative
immunity
here.
during
the
past
100
years,
many
times,
this
court
has
held
that
enforcement
entities
are
subject
to
actions
for
prospective
relief
from
unconsti
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct,
for
the
state
constitution.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
its
inherent
authorities
certainly
are
not
legislative,
and
that
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
we
characterize
them
as
administrative
to
the
extent
that
they
are
delegated
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
the
issuance
of
rules
is
administrative.
the
enforcement
of
those
rules
is
prosecutorial
in
nature.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes,
they
would,
but
that's
very
different
than
the
case
before
the
court
now.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
we
argue
that
it's
administrative
in
nature
because
we
believe
it
is
administrative
and
it's
not
necessarily
motivated
by
all
those
cases.
we
hear
the
act
just
doesn't
--
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
doing
does
not
look
at
all
like
a
typical
judicial
act
or
typical
legislative
act.
it's
involved
in
enforcing
disciplinary
rules.
it's
involved
in
issuing
rules
regulating
the
legal
profession.
if
the
virginia
supreme
court
regulated
doctor
participation
in
consumer
directories,
would
it
be
judicially
immune?
would
it
be
legislatively
immune?
no.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
that
--
we
would
sue
whoever
is
responsible
for
enforcing
that
law,
which
is
precisely
what
we
did
here.
we
brought
the
action
against
one
--
the
two
entities
with
authority
to
enforce
the
unconstitutional
disciplinary
rules.
ms.
ellen
broadman
we
could
not
do
that
here.
none
of
the
attorneys
in
virginia
were
willing
to
participate
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
in
our
directory.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay.
ms.
ellen
broadman
sure.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
true.
ms.
ellen
broadman
if
he
prevailed,
that's
correct.
but,
i
note,
here,
the
consumer
groups,
because
attorneys
were
unwilling
to
participate
in
the
directory,
their
only
means
to
challenge
the
rule
was
by
instituting
this
suit.
in
the
record
below,
there's
documentary
evidence
that
there
were
attorneys
who
wanted
to
participate
in
the
directory
but
would
not
because
that
rule
was
in
effect.
so,
the
consumer
groups
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
in
virginia,
the
attorneys
were
not
willing
to
participate
in
our
directory.
in
bates,
there
were
attorneys
who
were
willing
to
advertise
in
order
to
challenge
a
rule,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
if
you
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
i
guess,
no.
that's
true
because,
there
--
well,
in
bates,
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
in
the
bates
proceeding,
you're
correct.
they
would
not
have
obtained
fees
against
the
virginia
court
but
against
the
bar
association
in
that
situation.
there,
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
you're
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
you're
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
you're
correct.
that's
right.
i
stand
corrected.
they
could
not
have
gotten
fees
in
that
case.
ms.
ellen
broadman
we're
not
seeking
damages.
all
we're
seeking
is
prospective,
declaratory,
and
injunctive
relief
so
that
we
can
publish
this
consumer
directory.
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
we're
not
seeking
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
damages.
ms.
ellen
broadman
could
not.
yes,
i'll
concede
that
we
could
not
get
damages
here.
but,
in
hutto
v.
finney,
there
are
two
bases
for
awarding
fees.
there
are
two
fee
awards.
the
first
was
on
the
basis
of
bad
faith
and
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
the
bad
--
my
reading
of
the
bad
face
sc--
well,
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question
because
you're
deciding
the
case
here
on
the
basis
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
attorney
fee
award
act.
if
that
act
did
not
exist
then
we
would
argue
that
fee
awards
are
ancillary
to
declaratory,
injunctive,
prospective
relief
and,
therefore,
wholly
distinct
from
damages.
damages
are
retroactive
reimbursements.
fee
awards
are
merely
awards
which
enable
people
to
bring
actions
to
obtain
perspective
relief
to
stop
unconstitutional
governmental
acts.
ms.
ellen
broadman
entire--
ms.
ellen
broadman
absolutely.
ms.
ellen
broadman
exactly.
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
there's
no
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
i
think,
in
that
situation,
what
we'd
be
saying
is
not
that
they
can't
decide
the
case
that
way.
ms.
ellen
broadman
but
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
would
they
be
immune.
ms.
ellen
broadman
i
think
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
i
think
that
that's
a
distinct
situation
because,
there,
the
court
is
acting
in
a
capacity
of
deciding
cases
in
controversies.
ms.
ellen
broadman
it's
not
issuing
regulations.
it's
not--
ms.
ellen
broadman
i
think
we
might
have
standing.
you're
assuming
now
that
that
judgment
somehow
inferes
on
--
interferes
with
our
first
amendment
rights?
is
that
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
unconstitutional
rule.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
i
think
in
that--
now,
in
that
situation,
the
court
is
interpreting
the
rule.
it's
just
enforcing
the
rule.
the
rule
on
its
face
violates
constitutional
rights.
in
that
situation,
consumer
groups
could
sue
the
court
only
because
it
enforces
an
unconstitutional
disciplinary
rule,
apart
from
deciding
the
cases
in
controversies,
because
that
court
could
independently
go
out
and
initiate
proceedings
against
attorneys
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
so,
i
think,
there,
the
consumer
groups
could
bring
an
action
if
the
court
was
applying
an
unconstitutional
rule
in
a
way
that
violated
their
constitutional
rights.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
an
interesting
question.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
--
i
suspect
that
we
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
so,
i
suspect
we
could
not
have
joined
him,
but
i'm
not
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
we
would
bring
an
action
against
the
individual
--
the
justices
who
had
approved
of
and
had
voted
for
the
rule.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes,
we
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
the
chief
justice
is
also
a
named
party.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
they're
not.
let
me
just
point
out
that,
in
many
situations,
people
will
bring
actions
against
a
board,
an
administrative
board,
and
they'll
bring
it
against
the
named
head
of
the
board
and
the
whole
board
even
though
everyone
on
that
board
may
not
have
voted
in
favor
of
a
particular
regulation.
so
that,
i
don't
think
this
situation
is
all
that
different.
i
think
it
was
sufficient
to
name
the
chief
justice
and
the
court.
if
i
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes?
ms.
ellen
broadman
we
asked
attorneys
whether
they'd
be
willing
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
could
consumers'
union
sue?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
ms.
ellen
broadman
the
lawyers.
well,
there
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
there,
the
procedure
is
for
the
lawyers.
the
lawyers
can
appeal
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
no.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no
because
that
lawyer
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
because
the
lawyer
has
procedures
that
the
lawyer
is
supposed
to
follow
to
review
that
disciplinary
proceeding.
it
--
the
lawyer
appeals
from
the
disciplinary
decision
of
the
virginia
bar
into
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
then
it
has
a
right
to
appeal
up
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
ms.
ellen
broadman
we
don't.
ms.
ellen
broadman
he's
already
been
disbarred
and
he
appeals
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
--
and
he
appeals
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
the
cert
is
denied?
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay.
ms.
ellen
broadman
res
adjudicata,
he
can't
do
it.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
i
would
argue
comity,
both
res
adjudicate
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
because
if
the
federal
district
court
takes
--
well,
really,
res
adjudicata
is
the
main
reason.
ms.
ellen
broadman
yes.
ms.
ellen
broadman
no,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
of
comity.
once
he's
filed
through
the
appellate
procedures,
res
adjudicata
prevents
him
from
turning
around
and
suing
the
district
court.
where
he
hasn't
filed
the
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
that
raises
a
difficult
question
because,
there,
he
could
argue
that
the
appellate
procedures
are
inadequate,
but
somehow
it
could
show
that
they
were.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
if
he
brings
an
action
and
wins.
ms.
ellen
broadman
okay,
if
he
loses,
he's
not
going
to
get
counsel
fees
because
counsel
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
right.
if
he
wins,
he
can.
but,
i'm
--
i
don't
think,
where
there
are
proper
appellate
procedures
and
those
procedures
are
adequate,
that
a
party
can
turn
around
and
sue
a
judge.
the
only
time
that
they
can
bring
these
kinds
of
actions
is
where
there
is
no
appeals,
no
other
recourse.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
no.
i
think
that
you
can
assure
that
people
follow
proper
appellate
procedures
if
you
clarify
that,
where
they
exist,
they
must
be
followed.
the
doctrines
of
comity
prevent
people
from
bringing
these
actions
to
circumvent
existing
appellate
procedures.
ms.
ellen
broadman
to
us,
because
there
--
that's
correct,
because
there
was
no
other
recourse
that
we
had.
ms.
ellen
broadman
well,
the
standards
applied
to
administrative
officials
are
good
faith
immunity,
so
that
where
the
court
was
acting
in
good
faith,
no
damages
could
be
obtained.
now,
for
the
--
in
general,
damages
will
not
be
available.
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
broadman
if
the
court
finds
this
to
be
an
administrative
act.
the
court
may
want
to
characterize
this
as
an
administrative
judicial
act
and
preserve
the
immunities
that
exist
for
damages
but
not
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
but,
if
the
court
characterizes
this
as
a
wholly
administrative
act,
then
the
same
standards
would
apply
as
applied
to
other
administrative
officials.
where
courts
are
issuing
disciplinary
rules
is
going
to
--
there
really
be
any
cases
where
people
could
obtain
damages
people
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
a
panel
of
eight
judges
is
acting
in
bad
faith,
but
that
--
ms.
ellen
broadman
that's
correct
from
damages.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
