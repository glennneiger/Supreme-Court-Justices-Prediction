ms.
broadman,
i
understood
you
to
say
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
if
you
had
the
procedural
question
you
had
in
bates
that
the
lawyers
could
get
fees
from
the
court,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sort
of
ironic
that
where
you
have
a
clear
case
of
standing,
the
lawyers
get
no
fees
when
they
have
a
less
clear
case
as
they
do
here,
i'm
not
saying
it's
adequate,
they
do
get
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
against
the
bar
association.
they
resisted
a
disciplinary
proceeding.
this
was
not
a
1983
action
or
a
federal
action.
it
was
a
state
disciplinary
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not,
i
don't
know
what
basis
they
could
get
fees
in
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
hutto
on
which
you
rely
very
heavily
is
a
case
in
which,
i
suppose,
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
award
damages
against
the
--
if
the
--
against
the
prison
officials,
but
i
think
you
concede
no
damages
could
be
awarded
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that
hutto
analogized
the
free
recovery
to
punitive
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
it
analogizes
that
the
damages,
it
seems
to
me,
cuts
against
you
to
a
certain
extent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
here,
i
think
you
must
concede
that
you
could
not
get
damages
because
of
judicial
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
basis
of
the
opinion
cuts
against
you,
the
basis
of
fees,
as
part
of
cost,
cuts
for
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
--
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
do
rely
primarily
on
the
federal
statute,
the
attorney's
fee
award
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
reliance,
you
don't
have
to
recover
damages
in
the
question
of
bad
faith,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
totally
irrelevant.
