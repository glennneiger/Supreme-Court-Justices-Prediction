we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
supreme
court
of
virginia
against
the
consumers'
union.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
connection
between
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
the
subject
he's
bringing
up,
and
the
fact
that
the
party
named
was
--
the
named
parties
are
the
supreme
court,
presumably
as
an
entity,
and
lawrence
i'anson,
the
chief
justice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
clearly,
he
is
a
person.
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
broadman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
not
all
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
a
legislative
body
doesn't
have
the
right
to
--
and
the
power
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
own
proceedings?
this
is
what
father
rapley
was
cited
for,
contempt
for
interfering
with
the
proceedings
of
the
legislature.
are
you
--
do
you
say
that's
something
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
a
legislative
act
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
found
someone
in
contempt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
of
united
states,
until
recent
times,
enforced
its
contempt
determinations
by
decreeing
confinement
of
the
person
in
contempt.
because
it
was
such
a
burdensome
thing,
they
finally
passed
a
statute
giving
that
authority
to
the
united
states
courts.
but,
if
they
enforce
that,
if
they
enforce
contempt
orders,
do
you
say
that's
not
a
legislative
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
relates
somewhat
to
that.
it's
clear
that
you
brought
the
action
against
the
chief
justice
i'anson,
including
him
because
the
court
had
adopted
and
promulgated
this
rule.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
chief
justice
i'anson
had
dissented
from
the
rulemaking
and
the
other
justices
were
the
only
ones
that
were
responsible
for
putting
it
into
effect,
could
you
have
a
joined
chief
justice
i'anson
in
this
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
had
a
perfect
defense
that
he
had
no
part
of
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
“wrongful
act.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
how
would
you
get
here?
where
would
be
the
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
didn't
bring
--
you
didn't
bring
that
kind
of
an
action
here,
did
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
named
party
is
the
supreme
court,
not
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know,
but
the
name
--
the
other
justices
are
not
named,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
really
a
qualified
immunity
that
you
would
then
grant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
