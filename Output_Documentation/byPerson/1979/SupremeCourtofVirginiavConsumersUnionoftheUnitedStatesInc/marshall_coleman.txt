mr.
marshall
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
arises
from
the
holding
in
the
bates
decision
on
lawyer
advertising.
now
because
the
virginia
supreme
court
promulgated
a
rule
that
banned
advertising
prior
to
bates,
it
was
subject
to
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
by
a
three-judge
panel
and
so
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
judicial
immunity
will
stand
or
fall.
we
are
at
a
period
in
our
history
of
enormous
harmony
between
the
federal
judiciary
and
the
state
judiciary.
but,
this
case
is
really
an
anomaly
in
that
because
we
are
confronted
with
a
punitive
measure
against
a
court
that
did
not
act
to
the
harm
or
determent
of
any
party,
intended
no
harm,
and
wished
no
harm
to
any
party,
but
because
it
had
a
rule
that
was
generally
accepted
to
be
valid
throughout
the
country,
at
the
time
of
the
bates
decision
in
1977,
a
three-judge
panel
has
found
that
attorney's
fees
that
could
amount
to
$120,000
should
be
assessed
against
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
against
our
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
coleman
no.
we
urged
the--
below
the
question
of
a
judicial
immunity
and
we--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well,
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
which
was
quite
protracted,
there
was,
and
i
think
in
the
record
there
is
a
proposed
order
that
could
give
rise
to
the
thought
that
there
was
a
concession
on
that
point.
but,
during
the
case
as
it
went
forward,
the
state
always
took
the
position
that
it
could
not
be
--
the
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
assessed
against.
they
would
like
to
settle
the
question
and
it
was
a
matter
that
was
of
great
moment
and
ought
to
be
resolved
by
the
federal
courts,
but
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well,
they
were
named,
as
was
the
state
bar,
and
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
the
fees,
of
course,
against
him
were
in
his
official
capacity,
but
he
is
a
person.
now,
it's
our
position
here
that
no
one
was
harmed
after
bates
came
down
and
i
think
it's
a
clear
rule
of
this
court
that
when
a
rule
or
law
is
declared
unconstitutional,
then
it
has
no
force
or
effect,
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
any
party
to
take
any
action
and
i
think
it's,
in
fact,
recent
doctrine
that
if
the
court
should
change
that
rule
and
reverse
bates,
for
example,
that
that
law
could
come
back
into
effect.
but,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
or
any
suggestion
that
the
court
or
any
officer
of
the
court
at
any
time
sought
to
violate
bates
or
sought
to
enforce
the
rule.
they
clearly
did
not.
what
we
tried
to
present
to
the
court,
and
it
refused
to
hear
it
below,
was
that
the
machinery
was
going
forward
through
the
offices
of
the
state
bar
to
amend
and
change
the
rule
consistent
with
bates.
that's
not
a
matter
that's
free
of
difficulty,
i
might
add
and,
after
i
took
office,
i
issued
an
attorney
general's
opinion
for
the
bar
which
was
published
and
promulgated
to
all
lawyers
saying
what
the
impact
of
bates
was
on
the
rule.
but,
there
was
never
any
question
involved
in
this
case
of
our
supreme
court
not
acknowledging
supremacy
of
this
court
or
ever
trying
to
enforce
a
rule
that
was
in
violation
of
bates,
but
the
court
below
seemed
to
believe
that
because
our
supreme
court
did
not,
with
greater
haste,
changed
the
rule
subsequent
to
bates,
that
these
attorney's
fees
should
properly
be
assessed
under
1988.
and,
it
is
our
position
that,
with
today's
practice,
that
the
awarding
of
attorney's
fees
against
a
court
or
against
the
chief
justice
has
an
inhibiting
effect
that
is
just
as
severe
as
damages.
certainly,
if
the
court
has
to
stand,
when
it
is
acting
as
a
court
in
its
judicial
functions,
against
the
dread
of
having
attorney's
fees
assessed
against
it.
the
very
essence
of
our
system
of
federalism
and
constitutional
law
is
at
issue
because,
then,
the
judge
is
not
really
in
the
position
to
exercise
the
kind
of
independent
judgment
that
he
ought
to
in
trying
cases
and
in
making
judicial
rulings.
it's
interesting
that
when
the
doctrine
of
the
case
to
which
we
all
look
for
the
best
articulation
of
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
bradley
against
fisher,
was
a
case
that
itself
was
involved
with
lawyer
discipline.
that
was
a
case,
as
the
court
remembers,
when
the
judge
sought
to
remove
a
lawyer
from
the
rolls
and
within
his
inherent
authority
to
regulate
the
bar
and
the
court
found
that
he
could
not
be
moot
for
that
decision
because
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
was
such
an
important
one
that
has
been
there
as
long
as
we
have
had
courts.
the
lower
district
court
seems
to
be
saying
that
the
priorities
of
our
state
supreme
court
should
be
its
priorities,
and
its
priorities
apparently
were
that
our
supreme
court
should
amend
the
rule
immediately.
many
other
states
didn't
and
still
have
not
and
our
state
has
now
changed
that
rule,
but
change
it
or
not,
there
was
no
one
who
was
at
hazard
in
virginia
as
a
result
of
our
not
changing
the
rule
because
the
law
in
the
bates
case
applied.
now,
we're
not
talking
about
the
assessment
of
cost
or
filing
fees.
obviously,
that
is
not
usually
of
great
moment
and,
in
the
fairmont
creamy
case,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
need
to
get
it
filing
fees
to
continue
in
business.
we're
talking,
in
this
case,
of
shifting
the
fee
under
the
1988
statute
that
was
put
there
specifically
for
one
purpose,
which
was
to,
at
the
invitation
in
part
of
this
court
after
the
ruling
in
iliescu,
to
permit
attorney's
fees
to
be
shifted
not
to
create
some
new
remedy,
not
to
abolish
judicial
immunity
or
the
other
immunities
that
existed
at
the
law
or
in
the
constitution.
in
fact,
the
report
accompanying
the
bill
said
that
it
did
not
create
any
new
substantive
rights.
so,
it
is
our
position
that,
first
of
all,
even
if
you
look
at
a
statutory
construction
without
conceding
a
constitutional
dimension
to
the
right
of
judicial
immunity
that,
certainly,
in
this
case,
our
court
is
being
fined
because
it
had
a
rule
that
was
part
of
our
governance
in
virginia
that
everyone
thought
was
appropriate
and
valid
and
legal.
our
court
should
not
be
held
to
effect
a
punishment
because
that
rule
was
there.
special
circumstances
should
indicate
otherwise.
there's
no
hint
of
any
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
our
court.
secondly,
looking
at
the
statute
itself
and
looking
at
the
guidance
that
we
have
from
several
cases
-
pierson
against
ray
and
others,
this
court
has
found
that
if
the
congress
is
going
to
abolish
immunity,
that
it
ought
to
do
it
specifically
and
it
ought
to
manifest
that
it
wanted
to
do
that.
there
is
no
such
evidence
of
that
in
the
reports
that
accompanied
the
adoption
of
1988.
and,
finally,
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
entitlement
to
judicial
immunity
is
so
at
much
at
the
core
and
at
the
heart
of
a
function
of
government
that
is
necessary
for
our
virginia
supreme
court
that
the
congress
ought
not
to
be
able
to
overrule
it
even
if
it
wanted
to
do
it.
this,
in
fact,
poses
a
threat
to
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
we're
not
talking
about
prospective
relief.
we're
talking
about
attorney's
fees
that
were
awarded
for
something
that
happened
several
years
ago,
in
1970,
when
our
court
adopted
this
rule.
we're
not
talking
about
a
recalcitrance
or
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
any
respect,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
inherent
authority
to
manage,
by
rulemaking,
the
lawyers
in
virginia
which
is
an
inherent
function
being
in
jeopardy
and
every
other
ruling
of
the
court
being
in
jeopardy
if
attorney's
fees
could
be
assessed
in
this
case.
it
strikes
me
that,
without
an
independent
judiciary,
we
have
to
ask
what
our
history
be
like,
who
would
protect
any
of
us.
it
is
something
that
is
essential
and
is
needful.
the
question
of
who
pays
the
assessments,
whether
it's
the
state
or
whether
it's
the
court,
whether
it
is
an
individual
does
not
change
the
question
before
the
court,
and
the
question
before
the
court
simply
is
what
chilling
effect
this
decision,
if
it
is
upheld,
would
have
on
our
jurisprudence,
not
only
in
virginia,
in
the
other
states
and,
in
view
of
davis
against
passman,
what
effect
it
would
have
on
other
judges,
certainly,
in
stump
against
sparkman
this
court
seemed
to
take
the
immunity
issue
to
its
very
limit
and
to
hold
that,
in
that
case,
the
judge
could
not
be
answerable
for
an
act
he
did
as
a
judicial
officer.
certainly,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
characterization
in
the
opposing
brief,
we
don't
have
a
court
that
was
not
sympathetic
or
sensitive
to
individual
rights.
we
don't
have
a
court
that,
in
any
way,
attempted
to
trench
on
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
this
court
and
i
think
the
three-judge
panel
certainly
underestimated
the
difficulty
and
complexity
of
making
a
rule
for
the
entire
regulation
of
the
bar
consistent
with
bates.
it
underestimated
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
job
that
was
before
it,
but
the
appellees
in
this
case
seem
to
argue
that
even
if
the
rule
had
been
changed,
that
that
did
not
ch--
alter
the
liability
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
it's
our
position
that
this
trenching
on
judicial
immunity
is
a
threat.
that
it
would
result
in
the
intimidation
of
a
judiciary
which
would
certainly
interfere
with
the
functioning
of
our
republican
form
of
government
and
our
system
of
governance.
mr.
marshall
coleman
just
a
couple
of
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
our
position
that
the
remedy
in
a
case
like
this
would
be
an
appeal,
that
that's
been
the
rule
of
this
court
that,
in
the
virginia
supreme
court,
the
parties
could
have
appealed
petition
to
the
supreme
court
to
have
a
ruling
on
the
question
of
the
rule
and
if
they
had
lost,
they
could
have
then
appealed
it
to
this
court,
but
it
is
not
appropriate
for
them
to
go
at
this
collaterally
which,
in
effect,
is
review
of
what
our
highest
district
court
has
done.
there
is
nothing
that
the
supreme
court
did
in
its
capacity
as
a
supreme
court
to
deprive
of
them
of
any
right.
in
fact,
they
are
not
even
the
prosecutor
in
these
cases.
they
simply
hear
cases
that
are
brought
to
them
by
the
state
bar.
so
that,
in
this
case,
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
certainly
at
hazard
whether
you
call
this
immunity
legislative
or
judicial,
and
it
has
been
well,
i
think,
briefed
that
judicial
immunity
is
the
proper
denomination
here
because
it
is
an
inherent
right
in
the
court
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law.
there's
also
an
argument
that
this
is
rulemaking
that
is
legislative
in
nature,
but
whatever
the
immunity
is
identified
as,
it
is
one
that
should
be
absolute
and
that
should
be
broached
here.
the
remedy
should
simply
be
a
petition
by
a
lawyer
or
by
some
other
group
to
the
court
and,
as
i
said
in
my
opening
remarks,
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
act
at
all
done
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
the
prejudice
of
the
consumer
u
--
consumers'
union
and,
despite
the
finding
in
bates
and
the
changing
of
the
rule,
this
directory
has
not
yet
been
published,
but
that
is
not
because
of
anything
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did.
it
should
be
able
to
continue
to
operate
on
the
basis
that
it
is
immune
from
its
judicial
acts
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
