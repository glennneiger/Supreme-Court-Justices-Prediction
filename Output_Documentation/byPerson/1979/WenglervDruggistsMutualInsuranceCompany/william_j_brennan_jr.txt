the
scrutiny
test,
so-called,
in
every
case
simply
is
shorthand
for
saying
you
are
going
to
invalidate
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that
is
a
way
of
telegraphing
the
result,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
isn't
what
i
asked
in
my
question
basically
correct?
justice

do
you
know
of
a
single
case
in
which
any
court
has
ever
applied
the
so-called
strict
scrutiny
test
that
it
has
not
ended
up
by
invalidating
the
statute
before
it?
it.

of
course
they
did
not
involve
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
william

the
fifth
amendment
and
involved
federal
action
long
before
it
had
been
perceived
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
contained
some
equal
protection
ingredient.
