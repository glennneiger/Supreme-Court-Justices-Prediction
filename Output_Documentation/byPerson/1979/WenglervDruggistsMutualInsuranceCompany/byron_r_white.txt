justice
byron
r.

do
you
have
any
difficulty
at
all
with
the
claim
that
this
system
is
unconstitutional
because
it
discriminates
against
both
men
and
women?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
must
say
i
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
how
could
something
discriminate
against
both,
let
us
say
aliens
and
non-aliens?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
some
cases
it
might
discriminate
against
women
and
in
other
cases
it
might
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
point
is
that
in
some
cases
discrimination
might
be
against
women
and
in
other
cases
it
might
be
against
men.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
it's
against
women
if
you
think
of
them
as
wage
earners.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
against
men
if
you
think
of
them
as
beneficiaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
depend
in
each
case
upon
whether
the
male
or
the
female
were
the
wage
earner
and
which
spouse
was
the
beneficiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
her
employment
is
worth
less
than
the
man's.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
reid,
you
rely
a
good
bit
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
an
old
one,
it
dates
back
to
the
year
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
a
distinct
legislative
record
to
the
effect
that
the
legislature
wanted
to
compensate
widows
for
deprivations
of
the
past.
would
you
be
here
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
repeat
mr.
justice
stewart's
question:
doesn't
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
really
speak
to
the
result.
once
you
take
that
standard
the
result
is
inevitable.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
like
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
have
used
that
up
here
many
times
and
every
time
we
use
it
it
indicates
a
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
it
fit
in
to
treat
women
in
one
way
and
men
in
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
are
doing
it
by
classification.
why
don't
you
have
individual
determinations?
if
you
had
individual
determinations
every
person
who
was
entitled
to
it
would
be
recognized,
every
person
who
was
actually
dependent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
give
one
remedy
rather
than
the
other,
if
you
didn't
require
proof
of
dependency
for
either
sex,
that
would
be
administratively
more
efficient
than
the
present
scheme,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
mr.
kleinschmidt,
under
the
new
bill
will
they
require
proof
of
dependency
in
all
cases
or
in
no
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
yes,
a
presumption
of
dependency.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
do
you
think
boren
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
is
some
standard
between
--
in
our
cases
between
just
rationality
and
strict
scrutiny?
it
is
hard
to
say,
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri.
the
workers'
compensation
laws
of
that
state
provide
that
when
an
employed
wife
dies,
the
surviving
husband
is
not
entitled
to
benefits
unless
he
is
disabled
or
was
dependent
on
the
wife's
earnings.
the
surviving
widow,
however,
is
entitled
to
benefits
without
proving
either
disability
or
dependence.
this
gender-based
discrimination
was
challenged
in
the
missouri
courts
but
the
supreme
court
of
that
case
upheld
the
provision
as
merely
a
justifiable
recognition
of
what
it
thought
to
be
a
difference
in
the
economic
status
of
women
and
that
of
men.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
reversed.
we
hold
that
the
discrimination
in
this
case
which
as
we
see
it
is
--
is
against
both
of
the
--
the
deceased
female
wage
earner
and
the
surviving
widower
has
not
been
adequately
justified
by
the
state
and
is
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
judgment
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement.
