mr.
reid,
do
you
think
the
missouri
statute
discriminates
against
men
or
against
women?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
deny
any
women
the
benefits
in
this
case,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
talking
members
of
the
family
other
than
the
spouse,
aren't
they
treated
alike,
aren't
the
children
treated
as
dependents
in
both
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
isn't
any
discrimination
against
anybody
except
the
opposite
spouse,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
wage
earner
in
this
case
contribute
to
the
fund
that
provides
the
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
until
there
is
an
injury
i
take
it
there
is
no
discriminations
as
between
wage
earners
of
different
sexes.
they
both
pay
the
same
percentage;
neither
of
them
has
any
deduction
from
his
salary
and
there
is
no
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
but
he
pays
in
the
same
amount
for
a
female
worker
as
he
does
a
male
worker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
female
and
male
workers
are
single
and
have
no
dependents
at
all,
so
they
only
would
get
benefits
for
disability,
they
are
treated
alike.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
any
discrimination
against
anybody
except
a
male
in
this
case.
i
don't
understand
the
theory
of
discrimination
against
the
female.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
because
the
husband
is
the
wife
of
a
woman
--
is
the
spouse
of
a
woman
he
is
discriminated
against,
so
that
is
a
discrimination
against
the
woman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reid,
can
i
return
for
a
minute
to
this
case.
i
take
it
there
are
alternate
remedies
that
would
be
permissible
if
you
prevail;
either
they
could
require
proof
of
dependency
from
survivors
of
both
sexes
or
eliminate
proof
of
dependency.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
require
proof
of
dependency
from
both
sexes
that
wouldn't
cause
any
harm
to
male
applicants
but
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
female
applicants
to
lose
the
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
took
the
converse
it
would
give
a
lot
of
money
to
male
applicants
and
take
nothing
away
from
female
applicants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
either
way
male
applicants
as
a
class
will
benefit,
won't
they,
if
you
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kleinschmidt,
i
didn't
understand
that
there
was
a
stipulation
that
there
was
no
economic
loss.
i
thought
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
husband
was
not
dependent
on
the
wife.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
not
equivalent,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
us
assume
we
did
not
have
a
missouri
statute.
would
it
not
be
true
that
if
you
have
two
working
spouses
and
both
contributing
to
the
household
and
you
lose
the
income
of
one
that
there
is
an
economic
loss
for
the
pair?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
if
a
family
is
supported
by
both
parents
and
one
of
them
dies
and
that
income
is
taken
away
from
the
family
there
is
no
economic
loss
suffered
by
the
family,
as
a
matter
of
tort
law
or
any
other
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
the
two,
do
you
think
--
you
don't
think
there
is
economic
loss?
you
have
mortgage
payments
to
meet
and
all
the
rest
and
you
depended
on
both
incomes
to
meet
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
any
event
the
stipulation
is
not
that
there
is
no
economic
loss.
the
stipulation
is
there
is
no
dependency.
