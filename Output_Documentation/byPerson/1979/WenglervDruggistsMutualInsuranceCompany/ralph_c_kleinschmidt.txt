mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
try
not
to
restate
anything
that
appears
in
the
briefs
but
i
would
like
to
make
some
points
that
i
don't
think
have
been
emphasized
by
the
briefs.
we
are
talking
in
this
case
about
a
workmen's
compensation
law,
i
think
possibly
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
had
an
industrial
accident
law
in
the
context
with
gender
discrimination.
most
of
the
cases
in
this
area
have
arisen
out
of
social
security
laws
or
federal
welfare
laws
of
one
type
or
another
and
they
have
not
arisen
out
of
workmen's
compensation
laws.
there
are
differences
between
these
laws
and
i
think
the
difference
may
well
influence
the
case.
so
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
talk
about
the
history
and
the
origin
and
the
philosophy
that
underlies
a
workmen's
compensation
law.
as
you
recall,
these
laws
came
into
being
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
in
missouri
in
the
1920's
and
they
came
into
being
because
of
a
distinct
need
which
had
arisen
in
an
industrialized
society.
people
were
getting
hurt
in
the
factories.
unfortunately
the
remedy
available
to
them,
the
common
law
remedy
of
master
servant
was
not
sufficient
at
the
time.
statistically
about
30
percent
of
these
people
received
any
recovery
--
recoveries
were
received.
it
was
an
uneven
handling
of
it,
many
received
nothing
at
all
because
the
common
law
defenses
of
master
servant
contributory
negligence
fellow
servant
rule
barred
claims
from
being
made
and
the
result
created
not
only
a
terrible
problem
for
the
injured
working
person
but
for
society
itself
because
these
people
had
to
--
became
wards
or
tended
to
become
wards
of
society
when
people
were
hurt
or
killed
in
industry.
it
was
in
response
to
that
need
that
the
workmen's
compensation
concept
was
worked
out.
the
objective
of
the
compensation
concept
was
to
pass
on
to
industry,
which
is
the
area
where
people
get
hurt,
the
cost
of
these
injuries.
the
notion
was
to
get
certain
benefits
and
with
prompt
payment
into
the
hands
of
the
injured
working
people.
the
method
that
was
used
to
achieve
this
result
was
a
bargain
method.
that
is
important.
all
of
these
rights
and
duties
and
liabilities
that
appear
in
workmen's
compensation
laws
and
certainly
in
the
laws
of
missouri
are
bargained
rights
and
liabilities.
that
is
exactly
how
the
law
was
put
together
there.
the
trade
associations,
labor
unions
representing
the
working
people
on
the
one
hand,
various
management
organizations
representing
management
through
the
public
forum
of
the
legislature,
and
everybody
had
to
give
up
something
to
get
something.
the
result
in
missouri
and
elsewhere
was
a
law
that
provided
a
brand
new
remedy
wholly
substitutional,
an
exclusive
remedy
before
an
administrative
tribunal.
the
benefits
the
law
granted
were
limited
to
economic
loss.
this
was
the
only
thing
to
be
paid
under
workmen's
compensation
and
everything
else
was
given
up.
one
of
the
great
things
the
employees
had
to
give
up
in
order
to
obtain
liability
without
fault
and
reparation
for
economic
loss
was
the
opportunity
to
obtain
the
general
damages,
damages
for
anything
other
than
economic
loss.
but
the
whole
workmen's
compensation
concept
is
based
upon
reparation
of
economic
loss
to
the
employee
or
to
the
employee's
dependents.
the
workmen's
compensation
scheme
measures
this
economic
loss
by
medical
payments
on
the
one
hand,
weekly
benefits
for
temporary
disabilities,
amounts
for
permanent
disabilities
rated
by
weeks
and
in
cases
of
death
the
formula
used
is
based
upon
dependency.
the
point
of
all
of
this
is
that
in
this
kind
of
a
law
which
incidentally
the
employee
contributes
nothing
to
it,
specifically
by
statute
is
now
allowed
to
in
missouri.
of
course
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
a
fringe
benefit,
it
is
a
cost
but
the
cost
of
this
is
borne
by
the
employer.
the
net
effect
of
all
of
this
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
workmen's
compensation
law
is
to
pay
for
economic
loss
only,
nothing
else.
and
so
if
a
death
occurs,
as
in
this
unfortunate
case
here
where
there
is
no
economic
loss
and
it
stipulated
there
is
no
economic
loss,
this
law
was
never
meant
to
provide
mr.
wengler
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
beg
pardon?
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
no.
that
is
a
conclusive
presumption
that
brings
us
here
today.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
i
equated
the
two
because
under
the
scheme
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
--
under
the
scheme
in
missouri
statute
they
are.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
well
economic
losses
would
be
the
final
balance
sheet.
some
expenses
are
going
to
be
there
either,
so
the
balance
sheet
might
end
up
equally.
from
an
economic
loss
standpoint,
a
pure
balance
sheet
standpoint,
no
there
might
not
be
any
economic
loss.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
certainly
if
we
are
going
to
extend
this
to
a
family
i
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
i
think
maybe
this
can
be
in
the
mind
of
the
beholder
and
as
i
behold
it,
i
visualize
two
people
in
a
family
making
$5,000
apiece,
each
of
them
have
to
spend
$5,000
to
live.
one
dies
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
you
are
certainly
correct;
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
yes,
sir;
it
does
indeed.
yet
we
feel
comfortable
with
this
statute
in
light
of
the
decisional
law
or
this
court,
most
of
which
has
been
made
within
the
last
decade.
the
cases
we
rely
on
primarily
are
kahn
v.
shevin,
schlesinger
v.
ballard
and
califano
v.
webster.
in
this
series
of
cases
and
in
others
every
member
of
this
court
has
upon
occasion
agreed
that
there
are
some
gender
classifications
which
are
constitutionally
permissible.
there
has
been
agreement
among
all
the
members
of
the
court
as
to
what
the
requirements
are
for
that
constitutional
basis.
it
has
been
agreed
by
the
members
of
the
court
as
i
understand
it
unanimously,
that
where
there
is
a
proper
governmental
purpose
and
the
law
is
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
that
purpose,
it
is
constitutionally
permissible.
and
this
court
has
agreed
that
a
proper
governmental
purpose
is
the
reduction
of
past
disparity
to
women
caused
by
longstanding
discrimination.
all
of
those
things,
all
of
those
things
fit
into
the
missouri
scheme
of
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
well,
by
designation
if
you
are
going
to
justify
a
gender
classification
on
the
basis
of
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
in
reducing
past
disparity,
to
that
extent
that
you
are
reducing
past
disparity,
then
you
are
not
treating
by
definition
females
equal
with
the
males.
but
there
is
a
permissible
reason
for
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
another
recognized
governmental
purpose
is
administrative
convenience.
by
administrative
convenience,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
saving
of
court
personnel
time
but
i
am
talking
about
the
certain
of
determination
of
the
promptness
of
payment
of
benefits.
and
if
we
had
individual
determinations,
we
would
lose
that.
and
that
is
an
important
factor,
your
honor.
anybody
that
has
ever
walked
into
an
industrial
accident
board
anywhere
in
this
country
knows
of
the
redtape
and
what
occurs
in
the
--
you
have
got
to
have
a
certainty
of
the
payment
of
benefits
and
promptness
of
that
payment.
this
is
an
administrative
convenience.
it
justifies
in
part
along
with
the
reduction
of
past
disparity
the
distinction
of
genders
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
yes,
but
as
the
missouri
supreme
court
pointed
out
there
is
a
delicate
balance
in
these
acts.
it
has
cost
money.
the
district
of
columbia,
i
see
in
your
local
press
this
morning,
is
facing
that
right
now.
nobody
was
intended
to
get
anything
under
the
missouri
scheme
except
for
economic
loss.
if
mr.
wengler
in
this
case
and
all
others
situate
similarly
were
to
be
paid,
a
large
cost
comes
into
these
things.
each
death
case
today
takes
a
reserve
in
six
figures
now.
that
is
from
an
insurance
company
standpoint.
and
there
is
a
lot
of
money
involved
on
that
account
for
a
purpose
that
was
never
the
legislative
purpose.
if
they
would
change
the
act
and,
incidentally,
the
fact
is
there
is
a
brand
new
workmen's
compensation
law
pending
today
in
the
legislature
in
missouri
and
if
passed
this
problem
would
not
arise.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
going
to
pass
or
not
but
it
changes
a
lot
of
things
in
the
law.
these
things
go
on.
i
am
just
saying
that
under
this
particular
law
certainly
it
was
permissible
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
beg
pardon?
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
well,
i
was
making
it
in
response
to
a
question
here.
of
course
i
think
no,
of
course
not;
technically
from
a
constitutionally
standpoint,
no.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
no.
i
was
simply
trying
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
under
the
new
bill
as
i
understand
it
--
i
read
it
briefly
on
the
airplane
coming
up
--
apparently
there
is
going
to
be
a
conclusive
presumption
for
both
genders.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
yes,
yes.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
make
an
argument
in
this
case
that
i
have
heard
that
the
classification
used
in
this
case
was
not
a
proper
governmental
purpose
and
was
not
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
the
purpose.
that
is
the
test.
that
is
the
present
law
that
this
court
has
announced.
the
thing
that
bothers
--
that
is
worrisome
is
that
it
is
obvious
that
to
reverse
the
missouri
decision
it
seems
to
me
this
court
will
have
to
strictly
scrutinize
the
law,
which
is
a
method
of
saying
-
i
certainly
agree
that
when
you
strictly
scrutinize
you
are
invalidating
the
law.
certainly
that
is
what
amicus
the
american
civil
liberties
union
wants.
they
want
this
court
to
issue
that
clarion
call
that
all
sex
discrimination
cases
shall
be
inherently
suspicious
and
in
effect
make
absolute
and
inflexible
standards
out
of
these
gender
classifications.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
i
am
not
prepared
to
respond.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
it
is
very
difficult
to
say,
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
mind
of
the
beholder,
really.
the
only
thing
that
we
in
the
field
out
there
get
is
that
we
do
talk
about
classifications
which
are
shorthand
really
sometimes
meaning
what
the
result
will
be.
the
only
thing
i
can
be
certain
of
is
that
i
know
--
i
know
that
this
court
has
accepted
some
classification.
i
know
that
some
classifications
make
common
sense.
i
believe
in
this
classification,
it
doesn't
harm
anybody,
this
man
has
not
been
harmed
and
he
sustains
no
loss.
yet
by
putting
this
into
the
act
these
widows
are
benefited.
and
the
class
of
widows
that
are
benefited
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
it
stipulated
that
there
was
just
absolutely
no
dependency.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
and
that
is
the
economic
loss
rule
in
missouri.
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
i
haven't
been
talking
in
terms
of
harm,
your
honor.
we
could
talk
about
that,
of
course
we
could
say
there
is
harm;
you
lose
a
wife,
my
golly,
how
could
we
say
otherwise.
i
am
talking
about
the
economic
loss
as
measured
by
the
missouri
scheme
of
--
mr.
ralph
c.
kleinschmidt
well,
in
any
event
it
seems
to
us
that
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
missouri
court
in
this
case
it
would
be
sending
out
a
signal
itself
that
it
has
been
prepared
to
move,
to
sound
this
clarion
call
that
aclu
looks
for.
and
i
think
it
is
terribly
unwise
to
do
that
at
a
time
when
the
equal
rights
amendment
is
pending
in
the
legislatures
of
this
land.
this
court
is
going
to
be
faced
so
soon
inextricably
with
the
questions
of
draft,
registration,
golly
knows
what
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thing
to
do
is
to
stand
on
this
case
and
affirm
this
judgment
right
now
and
take
up
the
cases
of
true
importance
as
they
come.
that
is
my
argument,
your
honors.
