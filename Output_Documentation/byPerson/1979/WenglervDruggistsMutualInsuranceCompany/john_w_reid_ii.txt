mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
particular
case
is
whether
the
1976
revised
statutes
of
missouri
section
287.240
which
authorizes
worker's
compensation
death
benefits
for
the
spouse
of
a
male
worker
without
regard
to
dependency
but
conditions
benefits
for
the
spouse
of
a
female
worker
upon
mental
and
physical
incapacity
or
proof
of
dependency
discriminates
impermissibly
on
the
basis
of
gender
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
question.
this
case
arose
at
the
death
of
ruth
wengler
on
february
11,
1977.
thereafter
a
workman
compensation
claim
was
filed
by
the
claimant
for
the
death
of
his
wife.
the
referee
and
the
industrial
commission
of
the
state
of
missouri
held
that
they
did
not
have
the
authority
to
declare
a
missouri
statute
provision
on
the
death
benefits
unconstitutional
and
therefore
disallowed
the
claim.
the
claim
was
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
madison
county
where
the
circuit
judge
there
held
that
due
to
the
missouri
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
death
benefits
to
the
workman
compensation
for
paul
wengler
had
been
denied
and
therefore
ruled
in
favor
of
the
claimant
and
indicated
that
the
benefits
should
be
applied
to
mr.
wengler
for
the
death
of
his
wife.
thereafter
druggists
mutual
appealed
this
decision
to
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
there
in
a
divided
opinion
the
missouri
supreme
court
reversed
the
circuit
court
of
madison
county,
holding
that
they
would
not
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
test
as
it
had
been
applied
by
members
of
this
court
in
appropriate
sex
discrimination
cases
but
instead
applied
the
other
test
that
have
been
applied,
the
substantial
relation
test.
and
held
that
under
the
substantial
relation
test
that
equal
protection
clause
had
not
been
violated
by
the
missouri
workman
compensation
benefit
statute.
but
justice
donnelly
in
a
concurring
opinion
basically
indicated
that
he
was
troubled
because
he
didn't
know
what
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
was
and
justice
sieler
in
his
opinion
--
which
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
the
sole
dissenting
opinion
--
pointed
out
that
the
majority
opinion
even
though
it
applied
the
substantial
relation
test
that
the
--
in
his
opinion
that
this
court
would
have
found
that
the
missouri
workman
compensation
death
benefit
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
this
constitution.
and
pointing
out
that
members
of
this
court
had
applied
the
substantial
relation
test
and
therefore
the
substantial
relations
test
and
the
strict
scrutiny
test
both
would
not
pass
the
missouri
workman
compensation
death
benefit
as
it
applied
in
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
wengler
case.
and
the
dissenting
opinion
was
held
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
after
this
case
was
accepted
and
briefs
started
being
written,
we
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
department
of
justice
and
also
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
they
both
filed
amicus
curiae
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
claimant.
and
i
thought
that
this
was
very
strange
when
i
received
the
phone
call
from
the
department
of
justice,
because
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
department
of
justice
had
been
litigating
these
matters
before
this
court
in
the
social
security
cases,
federal
cases.
and
after
obtaining
the
amicus
curiae
brief
from
the
department
of
justice
i
found
out
that
what
happened
after
the
goldfarb
cases,
the
social
security
case
which
was
a
5-4
decision,
that
congress
thereafter
instructed
the
department
of
justice
to
go
through
the
social
security
laws
and
to
advise
congress
how
the
gender
discrimination
in
the
social
security
law
could
be
corrected.
and
according
to
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice
they
have
complied
with
that
public
law
which
is
on
page
3
of
the
amicus
curiae's
brief
and
in
february
1979
they
had
made
a
report
back
to
congress
of
how
the
gender-based
discrimination
can
be
corrected
by
congress.
so
that
i
think
this
is
an
expression
by
congress
that
they
want
to
correct
the
gender-based
discrimination
that
still
is
in
the
social
security
laws.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
this
report
took
place
in
february
of
1979
and
to
my
knowledge,
and
what
i
have
is
from
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
congress
has
not
passed
any
law
at
this
time.
i
think
that
it
is
the
claimant's
position
that
the
missouri
majority
misread
and
misapplied
the
tests
that
have
been
applied
by
this
court.
and
to
be
quite
fair
with
the
missouri
supreme
court,
there
were
some
cases
that
came
down
about
the
same
time
as
the
missouri
decision
last
term,
this
court,
the
orr
case
and
also
the
westcott
case.
and
in
those
cases
the
plurality
of
the
court
held
that
the
alimony
statute
of
the
state
of
alabama
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
and
also
a
portion
of
the
federal
statute
on
aid
to
dependent
children,
also
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
where
it
only
applied
benefits
to
the
father
who
was
unemployed
and
not
to
a
mother
that
was
unemployed.
i
think
the
american
civil
liberties
union
--
of
course
i
have
a
client
and
not
a
cause
--
the
american
civil
liberties
union
would
like
to
see
the
court
adopt
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
quite
frankly
i
don't
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
last
decade
would
have
been
any
different
if
the
strict
scrutiny
test
which
justice
brennan
has
written
about
in
many
decisions
in
1970
would
have
been
applied
by
the
court.
the
court
has
held
in
the
kahn
case,
the
decision
written
by
justice
douglas,
that
in
the
area
of
taxation
that
the
constitution
and
this
court
has
given
states
great
leeway
and
this
is
a
particular
area
where
they
have
done.
and
i
think
that
under
that
particular
decision
that
applying
the
strict
scrutiny
test
that
that
decision
would
stand.
the
schlesinger
v.
ballard
case
involved
a
decision
involving
up
and
out
of
the
armed
forces.
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
who
was
an
officer
had
to
move
up
or
be
booted
out
of
the
service
and
this
court
held,
the
plurality,
that
in
that
particular
case
that
the
constitution
gave
to
congress
the
authority
to
man
the
services
and
that
this
was
of
germane
purpose
and
that
the
court
would
not
use
the
equal
protection
clause
to
take
away
that
duty
and
that
power
that
is
delegated
to
congress.
in
califano
v.
webster
which
was
a
pro
curiam
decision
of
this
court
and
there
was
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act
which
gave
benefits
to
a
woman
by
deducting
three
years
off
of
her
earnings
requirements
for
benefits
that
this
was
a
specific
act
of
congress
to
do
away
with
some
past
discrimination
that
women
had
been
shackled
with
over
the
many
years.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
i
think
it
discriminates
against
both,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
discriminates
against
a
working
woman
and
i
think
perhaps
a
few
decades
ago
it
was
the
place
for
the
woman
to
remain
in
the
home
and
take
care
of
the
children.
today,
with
inflation,
with
our
way
of
life,
a
number
of
women
work
outside
the
home
and
raise
the
family.
and
so
by
denying
the
workman
compensation
benefits
it
does
discriminate
against
not
only
males
but
also
females.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
it
does
deny
her
family
benefits.
in
the
event
she
would
pass
away,
her
family
would
be
discriminated
against;
whereas
if
the
husband
passed
away,
she
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
for
her
and
the
children.
but
she,
on
the
other
foot,
if
the
wife
passes
away
--
the
mother
--
then
the
father
has
a
void
there.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
other
than
the
fact
that
the
opposite
spouse
could
use
the
money
that
would
be
entitled
--
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
to
help
raise
the
family.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
you
mean
it
would
have
to
discriminate
--
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
it
would
discriminate
against
--
in
this
case
it
would
discriminate
against
the
man,
the
male
the
way
the
statutes
are
written
in
this
particular
set
of
facts.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
i
see
what
justice
stevens
is
saying,
that
in
this
case
because
the
wife
is
the
one
that
is
deceased
she
is
never
going
to
receive
--
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
it
--
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
right.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
right.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
right.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
indirectly
he
does,
or
she
does
in
this
particular
case.
i
realize
that
druggist
mutual's
brief
correctly
states
what
the
law
in
missouri
is,
that
the
employer
is
the
one
who
pays
the
benefits
on
the
workman
compensation.
but
indirectly
all
wage
earners
pay
into
that
fund.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
no,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
deduction
from
the
salary
other
than
the
fact
i
think
when
you
think
about
the
total
amount
of
labor
that
the
employer
would
take
this
into
consideration,
how
much
he
is
paying
in
for
the
workmen
compensation
benefits.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
well,
it
has
been
advanced
i
think
in
the
american
civil
liberties
brief
and
pointed
out
in
some
other
cases
that
it
does
discriminate
against
against
the
working
woman
for
her
family.
and
that
would
be
the
discrimination.
that
theory
has
been
advanced.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
the
woman
would
be
discriminated
because
of
her
ability
to
support
her
family
in
the
event
that
she
had
passed
away.
that
is
the
theory
of
the
argument
that
is
used.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
theory
that
i
got.
this
court
has
held
that
the
following
classifications
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
reed
case
to
eliminate
hearings
on
appointment
of
administrators
justice
burger
in
his
opinion
indicated
that
that
was
not
a
legitimate
classification,
giving
preference
to
a
male
over
a
female.
also
in
the
reed
come
to
avoid
inner
family
controversy,
that
was
not
a
valid
classification.
administrative
convenience
in
one
decision
by
justice
brennan
in
the
frontiero
decision
was
not
a
valid
reason
for
the
classification.
in
the
(inaudible)
decision,
justice
brennan's
opinion,
the
fact
that
the
women
were
the
--
the
males
were
primary
supporters,
the
fact
that
the
women
were
given
benefits
in
the
event
of
a
husband's
death
to
take
care
of
the
children,
which
is
very
close
to
this
case,
that
benefits
should
be
paid
to
the
male
in
the
event
of
the
wife's
decease.
and
in
the
craig
case
justice
brennan
points
out
that
statistical
data
is
not
very
helpful
in
deciding
equal
protection
cases.
the
accident
of
birth
--
and
that
is
what
this
is
--
sexual
classification,
gender
classification,
it
is
an
accident
of
birth.
and
in
the
goldfarb
case,
which
is
very
similar
to
this
one,
a
social
security
case.
and
i
would
say
that
the
dissenting
opinion
in
those
cases
indicated
that
this
was
social
legislation.
the
workmen
compensation
benefit
cases
are
not
social-type
cases
legislation
on
that
justice
rehnquist
was
writing
about
in
his
dissent.
and
finally,
in
the
westcott
case
justice
blackburn
indicated
that
the
one-step
test
that
was
advanced
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
goldfarb
no
longer
would
be
followed
by
the
court.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
strict
scrutiny
test
is
based
upon
race
and
that
was
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
some
50
years
after
that
an
amendment
was
passed,
the
nineteenth
amendment,
and
that
gave
women
the
right
to
vote.
and
in
this
classification
i
think
that
this
could
be
a
suspect
classification,
strict
scrutiny
should
be
applied
to
sexes
as
well
as
race
because
sex
is
an
even
broader
term
than
race,
alienage
or
national
origin.
all
races
have
two
sexes
become
extinct.
this
is
a
law
of
nature.
justice
powell
indicated
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
craig
decision
that
due
to
the
fact
that
the
equal
rights
amendment
is
pending
the
court
should
not
go
ahead
and
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
test
at
this
particular
time.
i
would
point
out
that
the
race
and
the
sex
are
both
amendments
to
this
constitution
and
perhaps
as
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
stressed
that
it
is
time
to
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
test
in
these
gender
classification
cases.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
i
think
that
didn't
happen
in
the
--
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
yes.
in
the
webster
case
that
didn't
happen.
and
also
i
think
justice
brennan
in
the
bott
case
held
that
he
would
not
use
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
to
invalidate
that.
of
course
that
was
a
race
case,
it
was
not
a
sex
case.
but
that
is
the
stricter
standard,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
i
would
say
that
the
webster
case
would
be
a
close
one,
the
pro
curiam
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
1925,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
i
think
i
would
if
the
court
would
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
standard;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
involved
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
if
we
prevail,
yes;
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
reid,
ii
yes.
just
a
couple
of
moments
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
the
statute
that
is
pending
before
the
missouri
legislature
is
a
result
of
this
case
and
a
result
of
the
editorial
that
was
written
by
the
two
metropolitan
papers
in
st.
louis
and
kansas
city.
i
would
respond
to
that.
and
mr.
kleinschmidt
is
correct
that
under
that
proposal
that
both
spouses
would
be
presumed
to
be
dependent.
and
i
would
state
in
closing
that
irregardless
of
whether
the
substantial
relationship
test
or
the
strict
scrutiny
test
is
used
that
under
the
decisions
in
the
seventies
of
this
court
mr.
wengler
should
prevail.
i
thank
you.
