mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
challenges
an
interpretation
of
the
procedural
requirements
of
title
vii
that
has
been
followed
by
the
eeoc
for
some
twelve
years.
this
long-standing
interpretation
is
fully
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
subsection
(c)
and
(e)
of
the
act
and
is
therefore
entitled
to
great
deference.
moreover,
as
discussed
fully
in
our
brief
and
has
been
touched
upon
here,
congress
adopted
this
interpretation
when
it
enacted
the
present
section
706
as
part
of
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii.
with
respect
to
these
1972
amendments,
i
would
like
to
make
several
points.
first,
the
reference
to
the
vigil
case
in
the
section
by
section
analysis
introduced
by
senator
williams
that
counsel
for
petitioner
has
referred
to
this
is
not
simply
the
statement
of
a
single
member.
an
identical
section
by
section
analysis
was
introduced
on
the
house
side
following
the
submission
of
the
conference
report
by
rep.
perkins
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
relevant
house
committee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
submitted,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
submitted
into
the
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
congressional
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
the
section
by
section
analysis,
as
i
mentioned,
was
submitted
in
identical
form
by
the
chairmen
of
the
respective
full
committees
in
the
house
and
the
senate.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
were
submitted
in
conjunction
with
it.
they
were
not
officially
part
of
the
statement
of
managers,
the
joint
statement
of
the
managers
of
the
house
and
senate,
but
they
were
introduced
into
the
record
at
the
same
time.
the
conference
report
itself
does
contain
a
specific
reference
to
the
love
case
and
what
the
conferees
said
is
that
the
conferees
left
existing
law
intact
with
the
understanding
that
the
decision
interpreting
the
existing
law
to
allow
the
commission
to
receive
a
charge
but
not
act
on
it
during
such
deferral
period
is
controlling.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
way
the
conferees
were
interpreting
love
--
and
again
whether
or
not
this
interpretation
was
correct
or
not
is
for
these
purposes
beside
the
point,
i
think
--
what
the
conferees
were
equating
i
believe
is
the
notion
that
the
commission
may
receive
the
charge
as
being
the
equivalent
of
the
aggrieved
person
satisfying
the
filing
requirement,
because
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
i
think
that
that
reading
of
love
is
at
least
a
reasonable
one.
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
love
had
been
decided
several
weeks
earlier
at
the
time
the
conference
report
--
i
guess
a
month
earlier,
at
the
time
the
conference
committee
came
through.
and
what
the
language
in
love
said
was
that
the
charge
filed
with
the
commission
may
be
held
in
suspended
animation
while
there
is
a
deferral
to
the
state,
and
i
think
that
it
could
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
love
that
suspended
animation
would
mean
that
the
aggrieved
person
has
satisfied
his
filing
requirement,
but
that
the
commission
could
not
formally
file
it,
and
the
love
opinion
uses
that
phrase
"formally
filed
it
after
the
deferral
period."
so
the
deferral
period
limits
in
a
sense
the
commission's
control
of
its
own
docket,
it
cannot
enter
a
case
onto
its
investigate
rolls
until
the
deferral
period
is
over.but
that
controls
what
the
commission
can
do,
so
the
commission
is
not
going
to
intrude
on
what
congress
believed
should
be
handled
by
the
states
in
the
first
instance.
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
the
aggrieved
person
should
be
thought
not
to
have
satisfied
his
filing
requirements
within
the
statutory
period.
so
i
think
it
is
in
that
sense
that
congress
understood
love,
as
upholding
the
right
of
the
commission
to
received,
the
mere
image
of
the
commission's
receiving
is
that
the
individual
has
filed
his
charge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
in
that
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
in
that
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
as
a
purely
literal
matter,
yes,
there
is
that
difference,
but
again
this
comports
with
what
congress
understood
to
be
the
different
purposes
of
subsection
706(c)
and
(e)
and
this
was
stated
in
love
itself,
that
subsection
706(c)
is
designed
to
allow
the
state
to
have
a
prior
opportunity
to
look
at
the
charge
before
the
federal
government
brings
its
resources
to
bear
and
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
conclusion
follows
from
the
underlying
policy
of
section
706
itself,
which
is
deferral
to
the
states.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
believed
that
delay
should
be
excused
in
some
situations
rather
than
in
another,
but
congress
must
surely
have
been
aware
of
the
varying
procedures
and
limitations
and
substantive
laws
of
the
various
states,
and
congress
did
not
attempt
to
finely
tune
section
706
so
that
there
would
be
a
perfect
matching
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
state
jurisdiction.
it
was
addressing
the
generality
of
state
statutes
and
in
doing
so
it
decided
that
300
days
or
some
additional
period
of
time
was
appropriate
to
allow
a
person
to
resort
to
state
proceedings.
it
is
not
uncommon
in
an
analogous
area,
for
example,
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
is
silent
on
a
statute
of
limitations
for
this
court
to
borrow
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations
as
controlling
a
federal
action
because
of
the
deference
to
the
states
where
there
would
be
no
countervailing
federal
policy.
here
there
is
on
the
very
face
of
the
act
a
policy
of
deferral
to
the
states
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
federal
interest
to
be
served
in
requiring
a
person
to
file
within
180
days.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
yes.
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
but
congress
addressed
that
with
the
300-day
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
the
federal
policy
where
there
is
no
state
law
to
defer
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
statutory
language
is
where
the
aggrieved
person
has
initially
instituted
state
proceedings.
now,
the
phrase
"initially
instituted"
does
not
suggest
that
it
be
filed
--
there
is
no
mention,
for
instance,
in
the
deferral
state
part
that
a
person
must
file
within
180
days
in
a
state.
the
phrase
"initially
instituted"
i
think
ties
in
with
subsection
706(c)
which
is
that
the
person
must
commence
his
state
proceedings,
either
directly
himself
or
by
the
eeoc's
referral
of
the
charge
to
the
state
on
his
behalf
within
that
period.
of
course,
under
the
eeoc
regulations,
that
will
automatically
happen,
even
on
the
300th
day,
because
the
eeoc's
regulations
require
the
commission
to
forward
a
charge
to
the
state
if
the
aggrieved
person
has
not
done
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
so
the
state
will
get
a
notice
--
will
receive
the
charge
as
soon
as
the
commission
does,
according
to
the
commission's
regulations.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
limitations
period
in
section
706
was
identified
by
the
court
in
the
occidental
life
insurance
case,
that
a
statute
of
limitation
is
intended
to
put
the
respondent
to
an
eeoc
charge
on
notice
that
a
charge
has
been
filed
to
allow
him
to
prepare,
to
retain
records
to
prepare
for
a
possible
lawsuit,
a
conciliation
settlement
or
whatever.
but
even
under
petitioner's
construction
of
the
act
as,
for
instances,
requiring
the
filing
within
180
days,
nothing
in
section
706
requires
that
the
employer
receive
any
notice
of
the
charge
filed
with
the
state
within
180
days.
for
instance,
706
requires
deferral
to
a
state
if
the
appropriate
state
law
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
it
would
be
unusual
that
a
state
would
promptly
notify
a
possible
target
of
the
criminal
investigation
that
he
is
under
criminal
investigation.
so
the
one
purpose
that
can
be
identified
with
a
federal
limitations
period
would
not
necessarily
be
served
under
petitioner's
construction
of
the
law
because
there
would
be
no
guarantee
that
the
employer
would
receive
the
notice
at
that
period
of
time.
but
in
our
construction
of
section
706(e),
as
soon
as
the
commission
does
receive
the
charge
the
commission
would
be
required
to
promptly
notify
within
10
days
the
employer.
so
the
300-day
limitation
period
that
congress
has
set
on
the
outside
as
an
outside
limit
for
filing
a
federal
charge
would
insure
that
prompt
notification
of
the
employer.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
