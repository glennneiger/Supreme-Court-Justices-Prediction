mr.
santoro,
before
you
leave
the
legislative
history,
you
really
haven't
squarely
dealt
with
the
comment
in
the
conference
report
approving
of
the
vigil
case
in
the
'72
legislative
history.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
rather
important
thing
for
you
to
face
squarely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason
for
their
failure
to
change
the
language
other
than
senator
williams'
explanation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
explanation
for
their
failure
to
change
the
statute
insofar
as
relevant
here
except
the
explanation
given
by
senator
williams?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
in
your
view
that
if
you
prevail
here
then
the
vigil
case
was
incorrectly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
vladeck,
i
don't
think
it
is
really
a
question
of
what
300
days
means,
everybody
knows
what
300
days
means.
the
question
is
when
was
the
charge
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
706(c)
that
says
no
charge
may
be
filed
under
subsection
(b)
by
the
person
aggrieved
before
the
expiration
of
60
days
after
proceedings
have
been
commenced
under
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
saying
in
substance
is
the
language
simply
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
because
you
contend
that
it
was
filed
at
a
time
when
the
statute
explicitly
says
it
may
not
be
filed,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
had
not
occurred
on
the
291st
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
well
be
right.
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
you
are
giving
the
statute
a
reading
that
is
directly
contrary
to
its
plain
reading
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
goes
to
the
question
--
i
supposed
he
relied
on
the
eeoc,
they
gave
him
his
legal
advice
that
he
had
300
days,
so
it
really
wouldn't
have
made
much
difference
what
the
statute
said,
he
just
relied
on
what
they
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
had
read
the
first
two
lines
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
he
would
have
been
told
that
he
had
to
file
within
180
days
unless
he
had
previously
filed
with
the
state
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
deceptive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
starts
out,
"a
charge
under
this
section
shall
be
filed
within
180
days."
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
read
a
long
ways
before
you
get
into
any
intricacies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ever
explain
why
a
person
should
be
allowed
more
than
180
days
in
some
states
to
start
a
proceeding
but
should
be
required
to
act
within
180
days
in
other
states?
is
there
anything
in
congress'
legislative
history
to
explain
why
there
shouldn't
be
the
same
rule
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
under
your
view
of
the
statute
it
could
simply
have
said
in
non-deferral
states
the
charge
must
be
filed
within
180
days
and
in
deferral
states
it
must
be
filed
in
300
days,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
you
say
all
this
language
means,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
introduced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
to
be
sure
that
you
do
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
it,
in
case
it
is
missed.
is
there
anything
at
all
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
reason
why,
congress
thought
there
was
a
reason
why
someone
should
need
more
than
180
days
to
file
his
first
piece
of
paper
somewhere
in
a
deferral
state
than
in
a
non-deferral
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
having
these
proceedings
start
promptly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
it
address
it
in
the
first
sentence
when
it
says
the
normal
rule
shall
be
180
days?
isn't
that
the
federal
policy,
the
180
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
except
where
there
has
been
an
initial
--
that
isn't
quite
what
it
says.

justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
complaint
had
been
filed
directly
with
the
state
agency
on
the
291st
day,
would
the
same
arguments
be
made
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
eeoc
would
be
making
the
same
argument
and
the
government
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
had
been
filed
directly
with
the
state
agency
on
the
291st
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
what
provision
--
is
that
covered
by
their
regulation,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
it
was
filed
with
the
--
here
it
was
first
received
by
the
eeoc
and
referred
to
the
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
it
had
never
been
received
by
the
eeoc
and
they
had
never
seen
it
until
60
days
after
it
was
filed
with
the
state
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
assume
that
it
has.
so
if
on
the
291st
day
or
anytime
after
240
days
there
is
a
direct
filing
with
the
state
agency
and
the
eeoc
doesn't
get
it
at
all
until
after
300
days,
that
is
the
end
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
your
opponent
this
question,
but
there
has
been
an
awful
lot
written
about
the
eeoc
and
problems
related
to
this.
i
was
just
wondering,
has
there
any
study
been
made
about
analyzing
how
many
late
complaints
--
how
many
complaints
are
filed
within
the
period
of
between
180
and
300
days,
what
percentage
of
them
are
filed
more
promptly
than
180
days,
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
an
awful
lot
of
business,
i
guess,
at
the
eeoc.
