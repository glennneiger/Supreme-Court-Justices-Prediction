mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
against
the
petitioner
mohasco
corporation
was
filed
within
the
meaning
of
section
706
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended,
and
was
the
filing
timely.
on
june
15,
1976,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
received
a
letter
from
the
respondent
ralph
h.
silver
charging
mohasco
corporation
with
terminating
him
291
days
earlier
because
of
his
religion.
that
day
the
eeoc
deferred
the
charge
to
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
pursuant
to
section
706(c)
of
the
act,
and
55
days
later,
58
days
after
receipt
by
the
eeoc,
mr.
silver
actually
filed
a
charge
with
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights.
on
august
20,
1976,
66
days
after
receipt
of
the
charge
by
the
eeoc,
the
eeoc
sent
a
notice
to
the
petitioner
that
the
charge
of
employment
discrimination
had
been
filed.
mohasco
responded
to
the
eeoc
with
an
objection
to
its
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
silver
had
failed
to
file
a
timely
charge.
ultimately,
after
a
finding
of
no
probable
cause
by
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights,
affirmed
by
its
appeal
board,
and
a
finding
of
no
reasonable
cause
by
the
eeoc,
this
action
was
commenced.
the
district
court
on
the
timeliness
question
granted
the
petitioner
mohasco's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
holding
that
the
charge
was
not
timely
and
that
the
court
therefore
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
timeliness
question
reversed,
judge
meskill
dissenting,
and
held
the
charge
timely.
both
decisions
and
the
determination
of
this
court
involve
interpretation
of
section
706(c)
and
(e)
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
right
act
of
1964,
as
amended.
section
706(e)
states
that
under
the
act
the
charge
shall
be
filed
within
180
days
after
an
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred,
except
that
in
a
case
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice
with
respect
to
which
the
person
aggrieved
has
initially
instituted
proceedings
with
a
state
agency
with
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief.
such
charge
shall
be
filed
within
300
days.
section
706(c)
states
that
in
a
deferral
states,
such
as
new
york,
no
charge
may
be
filed
by
the
person
aggrieved
before
the
expiration
of
60
days
after
the
proceedings
have
been
commenced
under
state
law
unless
such
proceedings
are
earlier
terminated,
and
706(c)
also
contains
a
deeming
provision
for
commencement
purposes
under
state
law.
there
are
three
interpretations
of
the
statute
being
urged
before
this
court,
two
by
the
petitioner
and
one
by
the
respondent
and
the
government.
the
first
is
that
in
a
deferral
state
the
statute
requires
that
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
be
filed
with
the
state
agency
within
180
days,
in
which
case
a
complainant
will
have
300
days
to
file
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
the
second
interpretation
being
asserted
is
that
in
a
deferral
state
the
statute
requires
the
charge
to
be
filed
within
300
or
leas
days
provided
deferral
of
an
appropriate
period,
either
120
days
or
60
days
or
less,
as
appropriate,
has
been
completed.
and
the
third
interpretation
--
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
depending
on
the
state
you
are
in.
if
you
are
in
a
state
with
an
agency
which
is
less
than
one
year
old,
the
deferral
would
necessarily
be
120
days,
as
that
is
required
by
the
statute.
if
you
are
in
a
state
which
has
an
agency
which
is
older
than
one
year,
then
it
would
be
60
days
or
such
lesser
time
if
that
state
agency
completes
its
proceedings
in
less
than
60
days.
the
third
interpretation
is
that
in
a
deferral
state
the
statute
requires
the
charge
to
be
filed
within
300
days
and
all
else
is
irrelevant.
now,
each
has
received
the
approval
of
district
and
circuit
courts,
but
we
feel
that
the
majority
support
the
first
interpretation,
that
in
a
deferral
state
the
statute
requires
the
charge
to
be
filed
within
180
days,
and
we
think
this
can
be
shown
by
subjecting
each
of
these
three
interpretations
to
a
three-part
analysis,
asking
first
whether
the
interpretations
comports
with
the
language
of
the
statute
second,
whether
it
comports
and
if
it
is
even
needed
to
resort
to
legislative
history,
the
statutory
purpose
and
intent
and
the
third
is
an
analysis
of
the
results,
whether
they
are
fair
and
equitable,
understandable
or
consistent
and
predictable.
dealing
first
with
the
first
interpretation
that
you
must
filed
with
a
state
agency
within
180
days
--
which,
by
the
way,
means
really
filing
somewhere
within
180
days,
because
if
by
chance
one
files
with
the
eeoc,
the
statute
mandates
that
the
eeoc
defer,
so
we
assume
that
under
this
first
interpretation
the
180
days
will
be
accomplished
even
if
a
person
mistakenly
goes
to
the
eeoc
first.
it
comports
with
the
statutory
language.
706
(e)
clearly
states
that
a
charge
under
the
act
shall
be
filed
within
180
days
except
with
regard
to
the
initial
instituting
language.
secondly,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
need
to
resort
to
statutory
history
because,
quite
frankly,
when
the
words
of
the
statute
are
clear,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
necessity
to
resort
to
legislative
history.
but
if
you
do,
you
find
that
the
statute
as
enacted
in
1964
specifically
required
a
great
deal
of
diligence.
the
dirksen-mansfield
compromise
which
permitted
this
statute
to
pass
had
in
mind
two
specific
goals,
a
short
limitation
period
in
which
an
individual
complaining
of
discrimination
should
act
and
prior
resort
to
state
proceedings.
this
is
further
supported
when
the
'72
amendments
came
along
by
congress'
failure
to
change
706(c)
in
any
way
and
its
retention
in
its
lengthening
of
the
time
periods
in
706(e)
of
the
120-day
spread
which
clearly
relates,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
the
120
days
allowed
to
defer
to
a
state
with
a
fair
employment
practices
agency
which
is
less
than
one
year
old.
and
further,
the
results
are
exceedingly
fair,
understandable
and
consistent.
the
180-day
rule
is
the
same,
no
matter
what
state
the
complainant
is
in,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
deferral
state.
across
the
united
states,
the
rule
is
the
same,
it
is
understandable,
and
so
thought
many
courts
that
have
considered
it.
the
eighth
circuit,
in
olson
v.
rembrandt
printing,
the
sixth
circuit
recently
in
geromette,
certain
district
courts
in
california
and
ohio,
and
under
this
interpretation,
the
respondent,
mr.
silver,
is
clearly
not
timely
because
he
filed
nowhere
within
180
days.
the
second
interpretation
subjected
to
the
same
analysis,
the
second
interpretation
being
that
in
a
deferral
state
you
must
file
within
300
days
or
less,
providing
the
appropriate
deferral
has
been
completed
within
120,
60
days
or
less,
depending
on
how
quickly
the
state
disposes
of
it.
first,
does
it
comport
with
the
statutory
language?
well,
arguably,
yes,
and
the
courts
have
felt
that
it
did,
but
i
submit
that
one
need
to
take
no
particular
close
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
clause
in
which
the
exception
is
contained
is
no
more
than
a
clause,
and
it
uses
the
past
tense,
"has
initially
instituted."
i
submit
that
although
it
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language,
it
is
not
perhaps
as
consistent
as
one
might
wish.
with
regard
to
the
second
analysis,
does
it
comport
with
the
legislative
history.
in
the
first
place,
you
definitely
need
to
resort
to
the
legislative
history
because
you
have
to
rely
on
a
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute
type
of
reasoning
in
order
to
reach
this
result.
it
seems
to
run
against
the
diligence
required
by
the
dirksen-mansfield
amendment
that
a
short
statute
is
one
of
those
two
requirements
since
it
is
going
to
lengthen
that
time
period
in
deferral
states
in
a
way
which
has
not
lengthened
them
in
all
other
states.
lastly,
with
regard
to
the
results,
the
results
will
very
probably
be
inconsistent.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
i
submit,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
that
is
the
view
of
at
most
a
single
member
of
congress
perhaps.
senator
williams
i
believe
is
the
author
of
that
report.
it
is
not
contained
in
the
joint
explanatory
explanation,
it
is
merely
a
section
by
section
analysis
and
it
further
conflicts
with
a
statement
by
rep.
dent
who
explained
the
procedural
requirements
as
requiring
a
filing
within
180
days
regardless
of
whether
one
is
in
a
deferral
state
or
not.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
to
credit
the
statement
of
senator
williams
over
the
statement
of
rep.
dent
makes
no
particular
sense,
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
declined
to
change
the
language
in
a
way
which
would
have
very
clearly
indicated
that
this
change
was
intended.
i
think
it
is
a
bit
extreme
to
argue
--
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
yes,
that
they
did
not
intend
the
change
to
be
made,
and
that
in
fact
706(c)
was
intended
to
require
deferral.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
yes.
with
regard
to
the
results,
they
are
very
probably
inconsistent.
they
are
dependent
in
each
state
upon
the
state's
statute
of
limitations.
now,
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
one
must
file
a
timely
state
charge
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
the
300
days,
no
matter
how
you
view
the
statute.
you
must
still
file
within
180
days
if
you
happen
to
be
in
a
state
with
a
new
agency
because
you
are
going
to
need
that
120
days
to
defer.
you
must
file
within
240
days
in
other
states
or
you
risk
being
late
if
the
state
does
not
dispose
of
the
charge
in
less
than
time
period.
it
does
not
mean
that
your
time
would
necessarily
be
timely
but
you
do
subject
yourself
to
a
risk
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
a
result
which
is
desirable
in
interpreting
the
statute.
nonetheless,
the
interpretation
has
received
considerable
support,
not
the
least
of
which
being
the
fourth
circuit
in
doski
and,
of
course,
it
was
first
suggested,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
a
footnote
in
your
opinion
in
moore
in
1972.
under,
the
second
interpretation,
again
the
respondent
silver
is
not
timely,
although
he
submitted
to
the
eeoc
within
300
days
and
commenced
state
proceedings
at
least
under
the
deeming
provision
of
706(c)
within
300
days,
namely
291
days,
the
charge
could
not
be
filed
under
706(e)
until
august
14,
1976,
352
days
after
the
alleged
discriminatory
practice,
well
beyond
the
300
days.
an
alternative
view
of
these
same
facts
is
that
silver
is
not
even
entitled
to
the
300
days
because
he
did
not
initially
institute
state
proceedings
for
706(e)
purposes.
706(e)
has
no
deeming
provision
and
he
never
did
at
any
time
within
300
days
commence
the
proceedings.
both
of
these
interpretation
which
we
urge,
of
course,
require
that
the
word
"file"
within
the
statute
as
contained
in
706(c)
and
(e)
be
read
to
mean
the
same
thing.
the
last
view,
that
urged
by
the
respondents
and
the
government
is
that
in
a
deferral
state
you
have
100
days
to
file
with
the
eeoc,
no
matter
what.
how,
the
position
urged
by
the
government
and
the
second
circuit
majority
below
i
think
does
not
bear
up
under
the
three-part
test.
does
it
comport
with
the
statutory
analysis?
it
clearly
does
not.
in
fact,
it
requires
the
word
"file"
to
be
read
differently
when
reading
each
subsection,
and
so
the
second
circuit
majority
held
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
did.
secondly,
does
it
comport
with
the
legislative
history?
well,
it
is
certainly
necessary
to
resort
to
it.
in
fact,
it
is
required
if
you
are
going
to
find
any
support
for
this
view.
it
requires
a
resort
to
what
i
consider
a
rather
tortured
scouring
of
the
legislative
history
for
a
kernel
of
support
in
this
section
by
section
analysis
which
would
seem
to
completely
ignore
the
legislative
compromise
which
permitted
the
statute
to
pass
in
the
first
place.
with
regard
to
the
results,
it
mandates
that
the
results
be
inconsistent
between
deferral
and
nondeferral
states.
it
is
manifestly
unfair
in
that
it
favors
the
complainant
who
avoid
state
proceedings.
if
you
want
to
file,
say,
within
180
days
with
the
state
agency,
which
terminates
its
proceedings
quickly,
we
will
still
get
less
than
300
days
whereas
a
person
that
files
later
under
this
rule
with
a
state
who
doesn't
terminate
quickly
is
going
to
get
the
300
days
any
way
you
slice
it.
mohasco
argues
that
this
third
interpretation
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
words
of
the
statute
or
its
intent,
and
although
it
preserves
the
complainant's
day
in
court,
it
does
so
at
an
intolerable
price.
it
refuses
to
credit
the
literal
words
of
the
statute,
it
penalizes
employers
in
deferral
states
with
statutes
of
limitations
in
excess
of
180
days
by
taking
away
a
substantive
right
to
be
free
from
claims
filed
after
180
days
bestowed
by
the
same
congress
which
created
the
previously
nonexistent
right
for
alleged
victims.
perhaps
most
importantly,
it
constitutes
a
rejection
of
the
democratic
process
of
compromise
which
permitted
passage
of
this
laudable
statute.
no
doubt,
the
respondent
and
the
government
would
prefer
a
statute
which
gave
them
what
they
seek
here,
but
perhaps
it
is
true
that
the
greatest
thing
about
a
democracy
is
that
nobody
gets
exactly
what
they
want.
what
we
ask
in
that
the
statute
be
interpreted
as
the
congress
intended
it,
and
in
closing
i
would
say
that
perhaps
mr.
justice
cardosa,
when
he
was
still
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
my
native
new
york,
said
it
best,
that
the
wisdom
of
fairness
of
the
statute
i
make
no
attempt
to
vindicate,
our
duty
is
done
when
we
enforce
the
law
as
written.
if
congress
had
intended
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
it
could
have
provided
one.
we
submit
that
it
did
not
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
concluded
my
argument,
but
i
have
reserved
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
necessary.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
i
would
say
in
rebuttal
only
two
things.
with
regard
to
the
respondent's
reliance
on
anything
that
the
eeoc
may
or
may
not
have
told
him,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix,
page
3,
the
actual
complaint
letter
where
it
is
clear
that
whatever
they
told
him
should
have
no
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
would
also
add
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
defendant
as
well
as
to
notify
them,
in
response
to
what
mr.
kneedler
has
just
said.
other
than
that,
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
bench,
i
--
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
page
3.
that
is
the
complaint
letter,
and
on
the
first
line
it
indicates
that
--
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
yes.
to
the
extent
that
the
respondent
may
claim
that
he
was
misled
by
the
eeoc,
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
requires
a
filing
within
180
days,
nothing
that
the
eeoc
did
in
this
case
prevented
the
respondent,
who
made
no
attempt
obviously
from
the
language
of
his
own
complaint
letter,
to
file
one
prior
to
that.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
presumably
an
employee
of
the
eeoc.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
i
would
also
correct
one
other
item
which
came
up
in
mrs.
vladeck's
argument.
the
actual
charge
was
filed
with
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
on
the
349th
day.
for
purposes
of
the
deeming
provision
of
section
706(c)
only
would
we
deem
it
to
be
commenced
on
the
391st
day
when
eeoc
deferred.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
yes,
they
would,
depending
upon
the
interpretation
adopted,
however.
it
would
make
no
difference
in
the
result
in
this
case.
if
the
first
interpretation
which
i
suggested,
the
180-day
interpretation
is
correct,
then
clearly
it
would
not
have
been
timely.
if
the
second
were
adopted
then
it
might
have
been
timely
if
the
state
had
completed
its
proceedings
within
300
days.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
but
it
didn't
and
it
would
not
have
been
timely.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
i
believe
they
would,
yes.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
well,
perhaps
i
am
misunderstanding
your
question.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
in
that
case,
then
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
under
any
interpretation
it
would
not
have
been
timely,
unless
somehow
the
eeoc
obtained
a
copy
of
that
charge,
if
someone
filed
it
on
his
behalf
or
if
the
state
--
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
it
would
be
not
timely,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
thomas
mead
santoro
they
do
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
study
that
has
been
made
as
to
how
many
such
cases
there
are.
