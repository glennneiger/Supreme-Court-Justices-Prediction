ms.

p.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
today
is
the
meaning
of
a
sentence
in
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
section
706(e),
and
the
particular
phrase
with
which
this
case
is
concerned
is
that
which
states
that
in
a
deferral
state
a
charge
shall
be
filed
on
behalf
of
the
person
aggrieved
within
300
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.
we
are
told
that
there
are
three
possible
interpretations
the
300
days
may
not
mean
300
days
that
it
may
mean
240
days,
although
240
days
does
not
appear
in
the
statute
or
that
it
may
mean
180
days,
which
would
require
a
rewriting
of
the
statute
or
complete
amendment
of
it.
mr.
silver
lived
and
worked
in
amsterdam,
new
york.
after
he
was
terminated
from
his
employment,
he
became
convinced
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
discrimination
against
persons
of
the
jewish
faith.
he
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
beg
pardon?
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
yes,
he
began
to
believe
retroactively
that
his
employment
in
total
was
part
of
a
scheme
to
create
a
fiction
of
compliance
with
anti-discrimination
statutes.
he
then
sought
to
obtain
a
remedy
for
what
he
perceived
to
be
discriminatory
treatment.
he
inquired
of
eeoc
in
buffalo,
new
york.
he
was
told
that
he
had
300
days
within
which
to
file
with
the
buffalo
office.
having
been
told
that,
he
was
told
something
which
was
the
consistent
policy
of
eeoc
since
1968
that
is,
in
the
deferral
state,
to
give
the
larger
time
provided
by
section
706(e)
or
by
its
predecessor
which
had
permitted
only
210
days.
had
he
called
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights,
he
would
have
been
told
he
had
one
year
within
which
to
file
with
that
agency.
mr.
silver
filed
with
the
eeoc
within
291
days
of
his
termination.
eeoc
deemed
his
filing
to
have
been
timely,
deferred
to
the
state
agency
in
accordance
with
another
provision
of
section
706,
that
is
706(c),
permitted
the
state
agency
to
act
upon
the
charge,
resumed
the
processing
of
it
at
a
later
date,
more
than
60
days
later,
and
ultimately
issued
to
mr.
silver
the
right
to
sue.
the
company,
without
reaching
the
merits,
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
charge
with
eeoc
had
been
untimely.
the
varying
decisions
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
majority
and
of
the
minority
in
the
circuit
court
show
that,
although
we
are
told
that
the
language
is
plain,
is
certainly
seems
to
be
confusing
enough
since
with
all
of
the
attention
given
to
it,
there
were
three
separate
views
of
what
300
days
meant.
the
majority
of
the
circuit
court
said
300
days
means
300
days.
the
minority
in
the
circuit
court
said
it
does
not,
it
means
180
days
the
district
court
having
found
that
it
really
meant
240
days.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
291
days
after
the
day
of
the
occurrence
of
the
action
complained
of.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
i
read
it
as
congress
intended
that
it
should
be
read
and
as
it
said
it
should
be
read
in
the
1972
amendment
or
in
the
discussion
preceding
the
1972
amendments.
i
believe
that
reference
was
made
to
a
statement
by
senator
williams
during
that
debate
which
i
think
may
not
have
characterized
it
entirely
correctly.
in
1972
or
preceding
the
1972
amendments,
there
was
the
proposal,
a
senate
bill,
which
would
have
changed
706(c)
so
that
the
language
"no
charge
may
be
filed"
would
have
been
altered
to
read
"the
commission
shall
take
no
action.
"now,
clearly
706(c)
is
directed
at
the
commission.
706(e)
is
directed
at
the
charging
party.
it
tells
him
how
long
he
has.
706(c)
was
the
subject
of
discussion
and
the
intended
modification.
the
modification
was
deemed
unnecessary
because
congress
then
had
read
"no
charge
may
be
filed
in
a
way"
consistent
with
"the
commission
shall
take
no
action."
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
it
says
that
it
may
not
be
filed
until
the
passage
of
a
certain
period
of
time,
that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
that
is
also
correct.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
understand
what
congress
understood,
whether
it
understood
correctly
or
incorrectly.
i
think
what
it
understood
the
language
to
mean
is
what
is
dispositive,
and
what
it
said
it
understood
was
that
it
did
not
have
to
change
the
language
because
that
had
already
been
done.
the
interpretation
of
the
language
which
it
would
have
selected
had
been
achieved
for
it
by
a
decision
of
this
court
and
by
a
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit,
both
of
which
is
referred
to
very
specifically
in
the
section
by
section
analysis,
by
referring
to
love
and
stating
the
way
it
read
love,
whether
it
did
correctly
or
not,
and
that
it
read
vigil
in
a
precise
fashion.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
because
it
was
deemed
unnecessary
to
change
that
language
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
i
think,
your
honor,
where
there
has
been
any
lack
of
clarity
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
well,
the
answer
is
no,
except,
i'm
sorry,
it
may
in
fact
be
deemed
to
be
a
kind
of
glossary
lexicon,
guide
to
the
language
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
except
that
it
interpreted
a
phrase
to
have
a
particular
meaning
in
that
particular
context.
so
i
suppose
you
might
even
say
that
it
gave
you
a
definition
for
that
phrase
for
that
particular
purpose.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
no,
that
is
true,
it
was
not.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
yes,
it
was
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
it
was
filed
by
the
eeoc
immediately
after
eeoc
had
received
it.
it
deferred
it
to
the
new
york
state
division
on
the
same
day
or
the
day
after
by
mailing
it
to
the
new
york
state
division.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
i
say
that
resort
to
a
state
agency
is
required
in
order
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
300-day
statute,
but
it
can
be
resort
to
the
agency
through
the
deferral
procedure
which
has
been
developed
by
eeoc
which
has
approved
in
love.
mr.
silver
did
not
have
to
walk
to
the
state
division
office
first
and
then
to
eeoc's
office,
although
judge
foley
of
the
district
court
said
that
would
have
made
all
the
difference,
had
he
gone
to
the
new
york
state
division
and
then
walked
across
the
street,
in
effect,
that
would
have
been
timely,
reading
"initially
filed"
in
a
way
that
this
court
has
not
held
be
required
and
the
eeoc
does
not
and
has
not
for
more
than
a
decade
required.
filing
with
one
becomes
filing
with
the
other
agency.
i
would
add
to
the
discussion
of
what
happened
in
1972
a
statement
that
at
that
time
not
only
did
the
congress
have
and
did
it
refer
explicitly
to
love
and
to
vigil,
it
had
before
it
and
was
familiar
with
and
attached
to
the
'72
amendments
the
eeoc
regulations.
at
the
time
that
title
vii
was
enacted
in
1964
by
express
provision,
eeoc
was
given
power
from
time
to
time
to
adopt
regulations
to
create
procedures.
the
eeoc
has
uniformly
applied
the
section
as
i
have
stated
that
congress
understood
it.
there
was
no
effort
made
to
modify,
rather
than
by
referring
to
love
there
was
a
tacit
endorsement
of
what
eeoc
had
done.
before
i
leave
the
legislative
history,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
state
that
when
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1964,
there
was
a
compromise
and
this
is
much
written
about
in
all
of
the
briefs.
there
certainly
was
a
compromise
between
those
who
wanted
a
civil
rights
act
and
those
who
did
not,
and
there
was
a
compromise
between
those
who
wanted
to
leave
all
power
to
deal
with
discrimination
in
employment
in
the
hands
of
the
states
or
the
localities.
while
there
was
a
compromise,
there
was
no
abdication.
there
was
a
very
express
development
of
a
statutory
provision
that
guaranteed
deferral
to
the
state.
that
was
a
primary
concern
and
the
primary
ingredient
of
that
compromise.
it
remains
intact.
there
is
no
question
but
that
eeoc
and
its
processes
in
this
case
and
others
have
permitted
the
state
and
the
local
agencies
to
act.
by
1972,
congress
had
learned
a
lot.
in
the
first
instance,
it
had
not
spent
too
much
time
or
effort
in
developing
procedures
in
1964.
it
was
concerned
about
very
broad
strokes
about
basic
policy
kinds
of
pronouncements.
it
left
very
largely
to
eeoc
and
to
the
courts
the
development
of
the
procedures.
by
1972,
it
was
a
different
time
and
a
different
place
and
congress
had
a
different
approach
to
the
problem
of
dealing
with
discrimination
in
employment.
it
recognized
again,
as
the
courts
had
done
in
the
developmental
period,
that
this
was
a
statute
largely
used
by
laymen,
it
was
a
statute
which
could
not
be
hypertechnically
applied.
congress
also
recognized
that
its
hope
and
plan
for
conciliation
as
the
primary
method
of
disposition
of
employment
discrimination
appeared
to
be
less
likely
to
be
fulfilled
and
emphasized
more
and
more
the
need
for
litigation
and
more
and
more
to
remove
barriers
rather
than
to
create
them.
in
order
to
find
the
hidden
240
days,
one
must
reject
all
of
the
congressional
statements
that
were
made
at
the
time
of
the
1972
amendments.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
silver
was
pro
se
in
this
case
as
are
virtually
all
persons
who
initially
file
with
state
or
with
eeoc,
so
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
yes,
he
might
have.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
well,
i
don't
think
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
"except
that"
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
yes,
you
do
but
you
have
to
--
i
think
if
we
are
talking
about
legislative
intent,
we
have
to
keep
coming
back
to
the
fact
that
it
was
congress
that
said
it
was
going
to
create
this
dual
system,
it
was
going
to
have
deferral
states
and
non-deferral
states,
and
congress
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
there
is
nothing
that
makes
any
sense,
your
honor,
nothing
that
i
have
found.
i
certainly
don't
think
there
was
any
clear
understanding
in
1964
of
how
long
it
was
going
to
take
either
at
the
state
level,
the
local
level,
or
at
the
federal
level
to
wend
one's
way
through
the
administrative
procedures.
there
were
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
three,
five,
seven
days
of
a
deferral
period.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
anybody
who
hears
it
today,
i
don't
believe.
similarly,
there
isn't
very
much
sense
or
rational
kind
of
structure
in
any
of
the
state
system.
we
have
within
the
states
variations
from
30
days
to
three
years
for
filing.
three
years
is
a
recently,
1979
enactment
in
north
dakota.
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
precisely
what
happened
to
mr.
silver
could
have
happened
to
one
of
the
residents
of
this
district.
you
have
a
one-year
statute.
in
other
places
there
are
90
days.
the
numbers
game
can
go
on
endlessly,
but
it
is
clear
that
congress
decided
on
two
sets
of
numbers,
one
in
deferral
states
and
one
in
non-deferral
states.
mr.
silver
lived
in
a
deferral
state.
and
i
might
suggest
that
congress
might
have
been
sympathetic
to
the
victim
of
discrimination
who
had
to
make
his
way
through
the
various
of
the
administrative
agencies
before
he
could
hope
for
a
federal
remedy.
in
new
york
city,
you
may
even
have
three
choices
or
four.
there
are
counties,
there
are
city
and
state
--
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
exactly.
ms.
judith
p.
vladeck
that
is
a
very
simple
statement
of
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
final
words
on
this
subject
come
from
a
fifth
circuit
case
of
1970
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
title
vii
provides
us
with
a
clear
mandate
from
congress
that
no
longer
will
the
united
states
tolerate
this
form
of
discrimination,
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
make
sure
that
the
act
works
and
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
not
hampered
by
a
combination
of
strict
construction
of
the
statute
and
a
battle
of
semantics.
thank
you.
