so
that
equates
with
the
140
days.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
both
in
his
hiring
and
in
his
firing,
he
said?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
both
in
his
hiring
and
in
his
firing.
justice
harry

blackmun
mr.
kneedler,
if
we
adopt
that
interpretation
of
love,
the
plaintiff
loses
here
because
then
the
charge
wouldn't
be
filed
until
the
60-day
period
went
by
and
we
would
treat
it
automatically
as
being
filed
on
the
341st
day
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
suggest
that
love
held
that
though?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
correct
though
then
that
you
do
give
the
word
"filed"
two
different
means
in
the
statute
under
that
meaning?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
300-day
one
you
treat
what
was
done
on
the
291st
day
as
a
filing
and
under
706(c)
you
treat
the
60-day
later
period
as
the
filing,
you
say
that
it
is
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
same
word
refers
to
two
different
dates.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
ends
the
case
or
anything
like
that,
but
you
do
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
"i
have
only
300
days
in
which
to
file
a
claim."
