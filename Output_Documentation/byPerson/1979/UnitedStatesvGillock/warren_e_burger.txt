chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
gillock.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
brewster
case,
to
which
you
have
made
some
reference,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
any--or
offer
proof
of
any
legislative
act
of
senator
brewster,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn't
necessary,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
he
was
charged
with
taking
money
in
consideration
of
a
promise
to
do
certain
legislative
acts--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
think
the
court's
opinion
said
that
the
criminal
act
was
complete
when
he
took
the
money,
whether
or
not
he
ever
performed
any
legislative
acts
because
of
that
payment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
just
a
coincidence
that
this
gentleman
happens
to
be
a
state
official?
he's
being
the
perrin
case
which
we
decided
last
week,
is
it
not
so,
under
the
interstate--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
doramus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
suggesting
it
doesn't
give
protection
against
civil
suits,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
civil
suit
for
libel
for
a
speech
made
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
senate?
that's
protected
by
the
clause,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
saying
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
an
essential
part,
indispensable
part,
of
republican
government
in
each
state;
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

the
second

reasons
stated
in
an
opinion

with
the

this
morning.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the

mr.

whom
