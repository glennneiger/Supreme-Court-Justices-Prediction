mr.
james
v.
doramus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
before
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
before
this
court,
is
that
a
state
legislator
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding
is
entitled
to
the
same
evidentiary
privilege
asserted
and
upheld
in
brewster
and
helstoski.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
state
legislator
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution
either
does
or
does
not
have
a
helstoski-type
privilege
for
legislative
acts.
but
the
government
concedes,
or
this
court
has
held,
that
in
every
other
combination
in
which
a
legislator
can
get
into
court--state
court,
federal
court--in
a
civil
case
or
a
criminal
case,
and
there
are
eight
combinations
of
that,
and
the
other
seven,
in
each
case,
a
legislator
can
look
to
the
speech
or
debate
principle
for
some
relief.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor.
the
immunity,
which
we
have
not
asserted--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
--is
under
this
particular
indictment.
the
distinction
between
immunity
and
privilege,
in
our
view,
is
in
effect
if
a
principle
excludes
evidence,
in
some
cases
that
may
amount
to
immunity,
because
it
excludes
an
essential
element
of
the
government's
case.
but
that
is
an
effect.
that
is
not
something
separate.
if
it's
a
privilege,
it
takes
something
like
corroborative
evidence,
as
in
helstoski;
it
says
you
can't
use
corroborative
evidence.
that
is
privileged.
if
it
had
taken
away
an
essential
element
of
the
government's
case,
it
would
have
been
immunity.
but
the
principle,
the
underlying
speech
or
debate
principle,
is
the
same.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
the
district
court
denied
that.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
not,
by
us,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
appealed.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
immunity
is
an
issue
here.
if
the
privilege
sustained
in
our
particular
case,
in
some
other
case,
that
same
privilege
may
give
rise
to
an
immunity.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
if
that
is
the
point--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
we--it
is
our
position
that
there
is
an
underlying
immunity,
as
the
government
uses
that
term.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
wasn't
necessary--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
because
that
is
the
result
of
a
privilege
in
another
case,
not
our
case.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
i
would
say
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
this
comes
on
the
government's
motion
to
review
the
suppression
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
under
the
helstoski
v.
mener
[illegible
words]
there
is
a
question
of
whether
we
would
have
a
appeal,
a
direct
appeal,
from
a
denial
of
our
motion
to
dismiss.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
we
have
waived
that
by
waiting
for
the
trial.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that
was
our
view
at
the
time,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
is
our
position
on
immunity
that
that
does
not
make
a
difference
in
this
case.
we
go
back
to
the
original
speech
or
debate
principle,
and
apply
that
in
a
civil
case
or
a
criminal
case.
indeed,
in
the
federal
context--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
is
our
position,
it
has
a
different
application
in
a
civil
case
than
in
a
criminal
case.
for
instance,
you
could
move
for
summary
judgment
in
a
civil
case;
in
a
criminal
case,
there's
no
such
procedure.
and
we
would
maintain
you
would
be
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
privilege
excluding
the
evidence
of
legislative
acts.
and
we
would
also
point
out
that
there's
no
immunity
in
the
federal
arena
that
you
may
not
introduce
evidence
of
legislative
acts
against
a
federal
legislator,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
is
immune
from
prosecution.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking
in
this
case,
is
that
the
principle
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
with
respect
to
a
federal
legislator.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
according
to
the
opinions
of
this
court,
we
have
a
federal
constitutional
provision
that
comes
from
the
very
source
that
we
assert
here
today.
it
is
our
privilege
that
came
first,
in
federal
common
law.
the
english
experience.
the
states,
before
the
articles
of
confederation,
before
the
united
states
constitution,
had
this
same
privilege.
if
anything,
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
federal
written
provision
is
more
limited
than
the
broader
scope
of
the
common
law.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
it's
almost
substantially
identical
to
the
federal
provision.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
sir.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
is
a
hallmark
of
state
constitutional
government.
all
states
have
some
form
of
protection
for
speech
or
debate;
even
florida
which
has
no
statutory
or
constitutional
provision
has
a
state
common
law
speech
or
debate
principle.
i
believe
that
the
court--the
government,
in
view
of
the
court's
precedent,
will
have
to
concede
that
the
federal
provision
was
modeled
after
the
common
law
which
we
assert
here
today.
and
not
only
that,
but
the
reason
for
the
clause
is
not
to
protect
people
from
civil
suits,
but
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
the
instigation
of
criminal
charges
against
critical
or
disfavored
legislators
is
the
chief
fear
that
justifies
the
clause
in
the
first
place.
the--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
is
just
our
position
that
the
criminal
immunity,
or
criminal
privilege,
came
first.
back
when
the
crown
was
prosecuting
parliament,
they
were
not
afraid
about
civil
suits;
they
were
afraid
that
they
would
be
put
in
jail.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
we're
making
a
constitutional
argument--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
we're
making
a
constitutional
argument
in
the
sense
that
we
look
to
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
supplement
what
we
view
to
be
a
common
law.
it's
not--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitution,
because
of--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
i
believe
that
our
brief
does
mention
principles
of
federalism.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
and
it
mentions
the
republican
form
of
government,
and
it
mentions
the
tenth
amendment.
we
do
not
say,
because
we
do
not
think
we
have
to
say--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
would
be
invalid.
i
would--that
is
a
more
serious
question.
for
instance,
if
the
statute
said,
"no
state
shall
have
a
legislature."
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
before
congress
takes
away
from
the
state
this
old
and
well-established
right,
we
think
that
they
ought
to
specifically
say
that
that's
what
they're
doing.
the
statutes
under
which
senator
gillock
is
charged--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
would
be
the
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government,
and
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
tenth,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
a
part
of
the
states
long
before
there
was
a
federal
government.
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
there
is
no
speech
or
debate
privilege
or
principle
at
all
for
state
legislators.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
tenney
v.
brandhove
and
lake
country
estates,
which
recognize
the
common
law
as
setting
up
a
federal
common
law
speech
or
debate
principle.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
two
answers,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
is
that
we
do
not
depend
on
that
for
the
result
in
our
case.
that
is--the
guarantee
itself
is
some
evidence
of
the
federal
common
law.
the
second
answer
with
respect
to
the
political
question
is
that
in
baker
v.
carr
it
lists
the
type
of
cases
which
are
political
questions.
i
am
unable
to
find
any
case
where
the
federal
government
has
interfered
with
something
that
has
been
thought
to
be
such
an
essential
element
of
the
state
legislature.
and,
i
read
baker
v.
carr
as
saying
that
it
is
not
always
a
political
question.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
the
government
has
argued
that
there
is
no
damage
to
a
state
legislature,
no
harm,
if
this
is
not--this
privilege
is
not
recognized
in
a
federal
court.
as
the
court
found
in
helstoski,
there
is
harm
to
federal
legislators,
even
for
the
introduction
of
corroborative
evidence.
and
it's
an
interference
with
the
same
interest
that
is
protected--ought
to
be
protected
in
a
state
prosecution.
in
fact,
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
in
the
states
vitiates
the
state
provisions.
it's
our
position
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there's
one
executive
looking
over
your
shoulder
over
what
you
do,
or
whether
there's
two;
that
the
threat
of
prosecution
by
either
federal
or
state--legislators
is
the
same
harm,
and
hurts
the
same
interest
that
are
protected
by
the
principle.
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
the
state
legislators
are
powerless
to
protect
themselves
against
the
federal
executive.
this
is
much
closer
to
the
scheme
which
gave
rise
to
the
privilege
in
the
first
place,
when
the
crown
could
prosecute
parliament,
and
parliament
could
not
do
anything
about
it.
they--the
state
legislator
is
virtually
powerless
to
do
anything
against
the
federal
executive.
the
federal
executive
can
act,
if
he
chooses,
at
his
whim.
the
government
has
noted
a
measured
hostility
against
this
principle,
or
against
an
evidentiary
privilege.
time
and
again
this
court
has
considered
the
legislative
privilege;
has
weighed
its
value
in
relation
to
the
use
of
evidence
at
trials.
and
in
every
instance
the
court
has
determined
that
the
principle
underlying
the
clause
has
been
held
to
be
more
important
than
the
need
for
the
evidence.
it
is
a
limited
privilege.
it
may
be
waived,
but
it
may
only
be
waived
in
a
federal
prosecution
by
a
clear,
unequivocal
and
express
waiver.
congressman--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
it
does
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
you
have
held
that
it
does
not
preclude
prosecution.
it
is
not
immunized.
the
extra-legislative
act
of
bribery
is
not
something
that
is
protected.
but
what
is
protected--and
all
we
ask
in
our
case
is
that
the
fact
that
a
congressman
standing
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
voting
for
a
bill
should
be
excluded;
the
same
protection
that
is
given
to
the
federal
legislator.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
federal
provision
comes
from
the
common
law.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
agree
with
that.
because
the
literal
terms
are,
"shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place."
and
perhaps
in
the
area
of
whether
it
extends
to
an
aide
acting
instead
of
a
congressman,
yes.
but
the
literal
scope
of
the
privilege
is
quite
broad.
the
government
has
raised
the
argument
that
there's
a
different
in
the
power
of
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
injunctions,
and
that
a
state
legislator
may
be
enjoined,
while
a
federal
legislator
may
not.
and
it
depends
on
powell
v.
mccormack
for
that.
in
my
view
of
powell
v.
mccormack,
footnote
26
expressly
reserves
that
question.
it
says,
given
our
disposition
of
this
issue,
we
need
not
decide
whether
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
petitioners
would
be
entitled
to
maintain
this
action
solely
against
members
of
congress
where
no
agents
participated
in
the
challenged
action.
it's
clear
that
you
cannot
enjoin
a
legislator
himself.
but
in
bond
v.
floyd
it's
also
clear
that
the
court
could
have
enjoined
the
clerk
to
administer
the
oath
to
mr.
bond
without
ever
enjoining
any
particular
legislator.
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
routinely
prosecuted
state
officials.
the
cases
cited
in
their
briefs
are
prosecutions
for
congressmen
acting
outside
the
scope
of
legitimate
legislative
activities.
for
example,
they
may
not
have
any
authority
to
act
at
all;
and
they
maintain
that
they
act
under
color
of
law,
and
they
receive
money
for
using
their
influence.
that
is
not
a
legislative
act.
the
issue
could
not
be
raised
in
those
cases.
and
that
is
not
the
type
of
privilege
which
we're
asking
for.
there
should
be
a
reason
that
a
legislator
is
treated
differently
in
a
state
than
the
federal
executive
or
state
executive
or
a
state
judge.
because
of
the
history
of
the
clause.
a
legislator
has
always
been
thought
to
be
different.
and
this
court's
words
in
lake
country,
it
has
a
unique
status
and
enjoys
a
unique
historical
position.
indeed,
in
the
federal
arena,
evidence
of
a
president,
evidence
of
a
judge,
is
admissible,
the
official
acts
of
those
gentlemen.
but
the
evidence
of
the
legislative
act
of
a
federal
congressman
is
not
admissible.
and
that
is
all
that
we
are
asking
in
our
case.
the
government
has
mentioned
briefly
the
case
o'shea
v.
littleton,
and
how
official
immunity
has
never
been
applied
in
a
criminal
case.
that
is
correct,
except
for
the
case
of
in
re
neagle
where
a
united
states
marshall
was
given
official
immunity
for
shooting
a
man
in
california
in
the
course
of
defending
a
judge.
he--a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
issued
by
this
court
granting
him
official
immunity
for
his
acts.
more
importantly
for
our
case,
when
o'shea
v.
littleton
said,
we've
never
extended
official
immunity
for
criminal
actions,
it's
my
reading
of
the
case
that
they're
talking
about
the
official
immunity
that
may
apply
to
an
aide,
as
in
the
gravel
case,
the
people
acting
outside
the
legislative
privilege
in
the--who
work
for
legislators--do
have
an
official
immunity.
and
it
is
those--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor;
i
am
saying
that
official
immunity
does
not
apply--is
not
a
principle
that
this
court
should
consider.
your
honor,
the
court
has
considered
the
separation
of
powers
argument,
whether
the
difference
between
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government,
and
the
relation
between
those
two,
makes
a
difference
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
it
does--it
does
not
make
a
different;
that
in
fact,
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
act
without
any
check
toward
a
member
of
the
state
government
is
a
more
compelling
reason
to
recognize
the
privilege
than
when
the
other
branch
has
the
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
i
cannot
point
to
any
abuse.
the
court
has,
in
the
history
of
this
country,
protected
against
that
abuse
when
it
might
a
occur.
to
my
knowledge,
this
range
of
cases--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor,
i
was
getting
to
that.
except
within
the
last
several
years,
to
my
knowledge
there
has
not
been
a
case
into
conflict.
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
few,
if
any
privileges
which
are
as
well
founded
in
reason
and
experience
as
the
principle
that
legislators
should
be
protected
from
criminal
actions
for
legislative
acts.
the
speech
or
debate
principle
was
established
to
protect
legislators
from
intimidation
by
criminal
actions
by
an
executive,
if
the
state
or
the
federal--the
state
privilege
pre-existed
the
federal
constitution.
the
express
provision
is
drawn
from
the
common
law,
and
based
on
the
english
experience.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
we
have
no
such
statistics,
your
honor.
the
statutes
themselves
are
relatively
recent
vintage.
i
believe
the
travel
act
and
the
hobbs
act
within
the
last
15
or
20
years;
and
definitely
the
racketeering
influence
and
corrupt
organizations
act
is
within
the
last
several
years.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
unless
a
wire
fraud
or
mail
fraud
prosecution
under
the
isaacs
theory
could
have
been
brought
years
ago;
to
my
knowledge,
none
such
were
brought.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
it
would
appear
to
be
limited
to
congress,
because
it's
in
the
section
defining
the--
mr.
james
v.
doramus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
no,
your
honor,
i
cannot
tell
you
why
they
did
not
make
it
broader.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact
one
was
found
for
regional
legislators
in
lake
country
estates.
mr.
james
v.
doramus
your
honor,
the
best
answer
i
have
for
that
is
that
the
constitution
did
not
purport
to
set
up
the
scheme
of
government
within
individual
states.
it
recognized
that
states
would
retain
some
degree
of
sovereignty,
but
it
did
not
propose
to
set
out
the
rules
under
which
a
state
would
govern
its
internal
affairs.
your
honors,
before
i
close,
i
would
like
to
add,
with
respect
to
our
initial
argument
on
immunity,
that
the
reason
that
immunity
is
not
before
this
court
is
that
the
district
court
held
that
the
indictment
was
not
based
on
legislative
acts.
when
the
principle
applies,
we
submit
it
applies
to
criminal
cases
as
well
as
civil
cases,
and
that
the
privilege
is
recognized
in
federal
common
law,
in
lake
country
estates,
tenney
v.
brandhove.
the
opinion
below
recognized
an
implied
limited
evidentiary
privilege.
the
same
privilege
applied
in
brewster.
this
holding
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
between
the
interests
of
the
federal
government
and
prosecuting
state
legislators,
and
the
necessity
to
ensure
the
independence
of
those
legislators.
