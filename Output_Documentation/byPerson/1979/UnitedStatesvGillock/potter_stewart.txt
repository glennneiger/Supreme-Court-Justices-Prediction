justice
potter
stewart
and
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
solicitor
general,
tenney
v.
brandhove
involved
immunity
from
civil
liability.
this
case
involves
an
evidentiary
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
there's
no
claim
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
immune
from
prosecution,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we've--there
are
also
remarks
in
certain
cases,
i
should
remember
since
i
was
responsible--
justice
potter
stewart
--where
we've
indicated
that
the
non-speech
or
debate
clause
executive
privilege,
or
privilege
for
federal
employees,
doesn't
reach
criminal
liability.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
the
conflict
is
on
the
testimonial
privilege,
which
is
the
issue
before
us
in
this
case.
not
on
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
all
agree
that
there's
no
immunity
to
prosecution
under
these
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
conceded
in
this
case--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
that
we're
not
talking
here
about
immunity
but
about
an
evidentiary
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn't
think
you
had.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
you
were
immune
from
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
did
you
fare
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
appealed?
justice
potter
stewart
hm?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
appealed
by
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
wasn't
appealed,
was
it?
so
that's
not
an
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
an
issue
before
us
here,
is
it?
the
issue
is
one
of
evidentiary
privilege,
is
it
not?
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
written,
and
that's
the
way
the
briefs
are
written,
and
that's
the
way
the
oral
argument
was
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
justice
potter
stewart
may
give
rise
to
an
inability
to
convict,
but
hardly
to
any
immunity
from
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
which
is
right?
are
you
right,
or
am
i,
in
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
an
issue
before
us
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
held
that
you
were
not
immune
from
prosecution,
you
just
told
me,
and
that
was
never
appealed.
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
is
that
an
issue
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
the
result
is,
an
inability
to
convict.
but
that's
quite
different
from
immunity
from
prosecution.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it
isn't
just
a
question
for
the
judge
and
jury,
that
you
could
not
have
appealed
the
order
denying
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment;
that's
not
an
appealable
order,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought--perhaps
i
wholly
misapprehended
this
case;
i'm
beginning
to
think
perhaps
i
have--but
i
thought
that
you
reliance,
and
the
reliance
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
on
common
law
evidentiary
privileges;
not
on
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
you
tell
my
brother
white
you're
relying
on
the
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't.
your
brief
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
also
your
position,
as
i
understood
your
answers
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
congress
constitutionally
could
not
specifically
say
that
these
criminal
statutes
are
available
to
be
used
to
prosecute
state
legislators,
and
that
if,
in
any
such
prosecution,
the
legislators
were
to
have
no
evidentiary
privilege
for
legislative
acts.
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
there
are
lots
of
common
law
evidentiary
rules
that
not
only
were
not
adopted
in
the
constitution,
but
are
not
part
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
such
as
the
inability
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
testify
at
all.
that's
just
one
rather
conspicuous
example
very
deeply
embedded
in
the
common
law.
