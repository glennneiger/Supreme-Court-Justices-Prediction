justice
byron
r.
white
and
brewster
was
a
speech
or
debate
clause--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
never
tried,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
didn't
bring
the--as
a
respondent.
i
don't
think
you
can
raise
the
immunity
issue
here,
because
that
would
[illegible
word]
there
could
be
no
trial
at
all.
and
you
haven't
cross-petitioned,
have
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be
appealable,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
couldn't
have
asserted
it
as
a
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you
weren't
the
appellant?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
united
states
constitution
forbids
the
federal
government
from
prosecuting
a
state
legislator
for
a
state
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say--is
it
your
claim
that
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
specifically
in
a
criminal
statute,
"this
statute
will
apply
to
state
legislators
for
their
legislative
acts,"
would
you
say
that
you
would
be
invalid
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
different
question.
that's
a
different
question.
but
just
a
criminal
statute
that
without
question
applies
to
state
legislators.
you
would
say
that
would
be
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you're
wrong
on
that.
assume
you're
wrong
on
that.
what
argument
in
addition
to
that
are
you
making
here,
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
include
state
legislators
within
the
reach
of
this
particular
criminal
statute
because
of
the
common
law,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
making
an
argument--like
in
1983,
this
court
has
said
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
invalidate,
or
not
to
recognize,
or
to
set
aside
the
common
law
immunities.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
1983.
and
you're
making
a
similar
argument
with
respect
to
the
criminal
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
congress,
just
as
a
matter
of
legislative--just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
we
should
construe
the
statute
as
not
reaching
legislative
acts
of
state
legislators?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that's
one
of
your
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hasn't
the
court
indicated
that
a
member
of
congress,
if
he's
acting
outside
the
reach
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
if
what
he's
doing
isn't
a
legislative
act,
because
a
claim
that--but
he
claims
in
defense
the
federal
common
law
legislative
privilege
of
a
federal
official,
that
that
privilege,
that
common
law
privilege,
doesn't
reach--doesn't
immunize
him
from
criminal
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we've--but
we've
held
that
it
hasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you've--in
order
to
really--you
really
would
want
to
elevate
a
common
law
privilege
or
immunity
to
constitutional
status
then.
you
would
want
to
equate
it
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
which
is
in
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
immunity
now,
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
connection,
can
you
give
us
any
instances
of
historical
abuse
of
this
kind
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
that,
are
you
overlooking
the
conflict
in
this
issue
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
