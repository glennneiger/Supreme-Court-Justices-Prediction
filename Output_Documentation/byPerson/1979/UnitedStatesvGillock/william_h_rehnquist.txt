justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general,
how
do
you
reconcile
the
application
of
that
principle
in
this
case
with
tenney
v.
brandhove?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
interest
akin
to
that
spoken
of
in
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
brewster
that
if
this
man
is
offered
a
bribe
by
the
electrician--some
out
of
state
syndicate
to
introduce
legislative
language
favoring
electricians,
that
he
will
thereafter
simply
shy
away
from
that
issue
for
fear
that
he
will
be
prosecuted,
even
though
he
in
good
faith
believes
that
such
legislation
should
be
introduced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
frankfurter,
in
tenney
v.
brandhove,
said
that
1983
was
informed
by
the
common
law
understanding
of
legislative
privilege.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nonetheless,
here
you
do
have
a
restriction
on
the
legislator's
ability
to
follow
his
normal
instincts,
or
respond
to
his
constituents
in
that
you
have
another
force,
a
fear
of
federal
prosecution,
that
may
prevent
him
from
perfectly
honestly
responding
to
the
judgments
of
his
constituents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
it
the
business
of
the
federal
government
to
prevent
the
corruption
of
a
state
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
tenney
was
charged
under
the
citizen
could
have,
as
i
recall
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
the
holding
of
the
court
way
back
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
that
the
republican
form
of
government
guarantee
is
a
political
question,
and
can't
be
considered
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
baker
v.
carr,
then,
undercut
pacific
tel
&
tel
v.
oregon,
the
early
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
court
has
certainly
taken
the
federal
speech
and
debate
clause
far
beyond
its
literal
terms,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
statistics,
or
if
not
statistics,
figures
in
the
briefs
of
either
party
indicating
how
often,
and
how
recently,
state
legislatures
have
been
prosecuted
under
federal
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
congress
didn't
really
authorize
it
until
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
congress
didn't
adopt--the
constitution
doesn't
contain
any
speech
or
debate
privilege
for
state
legislators
in
connection
with
1983,
and
yet
one
was
found
in
tenney
v.
brandhove.
