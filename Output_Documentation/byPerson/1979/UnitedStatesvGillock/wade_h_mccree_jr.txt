mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
rule
501
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
encompasses
a
common
law
legislative
privilege
analogous
to
that
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
the
constitution
that
prohibits
the
federal
government
from
adducing
evidence
of
the
legislative
acts
of
a
state
legislator
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
respondent
is
a
tennessee
state
senator,
at
least
for
all
relevant
times
in
this
litigation
he
was;
elected
from
shelby
county
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
he
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee
on
five
counts
of
violations
of
the
hobbs
act,
the
travel
act
and
the
riekle
act,
the
racketeering
and
corrupt
practices
act.
it
was--these
three
indictment--these
several
counts
of
the
indictment
charged
him
essentially
with
two
transactions
in
which
he
is
alleged
to
have
abused
his
official
status.
the
first
related
to
an
effort
for
a
bribe
to
prevent
the
extradition
of
a
tennessee
prisoner
to
the
state
of
illinois.
the
second
transaction
related
to,
in
consideration
for
a
bribe,
introducing
legislation
in
the
state
legislature
to
enable
electricians
who
were
licensed
in
states
with
fairly
lax
requirements
to
practice
their
trade
in
counties
that
had
a
more
stringent
requirement
for
licensure.
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
to
suppress
evidence
of
his
legislative
acts.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
travel
act
portion
of
the
indictment,
but
allowed
the
other
two
statutory
violations
allegations
to
stand,
but
did
recognize
a
legislative--an
evidentiary
privilege
which
would
exclude
evidence
of
legislative
acts
in
the
prosecution
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
government
appealed,
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
have
the
district
court
specify
the
legislative
act
concerning
which
evidence
could
not
be
presented.
the
district
court
again
recognized
an
evidentiary
privilege
specified
the
legislative
acts
concerning
which
evidence
could
not
be
presented.
and
the
government
has--the
united
states
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
finding
that
rule
501
did
create
an
evidentiary
privilege
relating
to
legislative
acts,
and
disagreed
in
part
with
the
identification
of
certain
acts,
evidence
of
which
could
not
be
adduced.
we
do
not
quarrel
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
with
the
united
states
district
court's
determination
about
specific
acts.
and
the
only
question
presented
to
the
court
at
this
time
is
whether
rule
501
creates
an
evidentiary
privilege
analogous
to
that
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
benefits
only
a
member
of
the
federal
congress.
we
assert
in
our
argument
three
essential
points.
first,
that
the
federal
common
law
does
not
recognize
a
legislative
privilege
akin
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
absence
of
an
underlying
immunity
from
prosecution.
second,
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
that
informs
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
does
not
apply
in
a
case
involving
a
state
legislature.
and
third,
that
admission
of
this
evidence
is
not
incompatible
with
the
due
regard
for
the
independence
and
functioning
of
state
governments.
on
the
first
point,
we
begin
with
the
proposition
often
asserted
by
this
court
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
every
man's
evidence,
and
that
a
privilege
that
would
seek
to
keep
out
of
a
prosecution
relevant
evidence
obstructs
the
search
for
truth.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
tenney
v.
brandhove
was
a
case
that
recognized
a
common
law
immunity
from
prosecution--i
beg
your
pardon,
a
common
law
immunity
for
civil
liability
for
legislative
acts.
and
this
was
to--on
balance,
the
immunity
protected
the
legislator
in
the
performance
of
the
duty
for
which
he
was
elected.
he
was
not
immunized
from
criminal
liability.
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
respondent
was
indicted
for
violation
of
federal
criminal
law.
and
we
feel
that
this
distinction
is
sufficient,
because
there
is
no
interest
in
protecting
the
legislator
from
responding
for
criminal
behavior
as
there
would
be
for
his
non-criminal
legislative
acts.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
there
is
validity
to
that
point.
but
the
court
has
never
gone
that
far.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
should
not
go
that
far.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
brewster
was,
as
you
point
out,
mr.
justice
white,
a
speech
or
debate
clause
case.
and
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
informed
by
the
values
protected
under
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers.
and
it
is
to
prevent
a
member
of
the
congress
from
being
prosecuted
either
criminally
or
civilly
for
anything
he
does
in
the
way
of
a
legislative
act,
and--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
tenney
v.
brandhove
does
make
that
suggestion.
but
subsequent
rulings
and
decisions
by
this
court
have
made
it
clear
that
tenney
v.
brandhove
is
founded
in
the
common
law
civil
immunity
of
a
state
legislator,
and
not
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
lake
country
estates
v.
lake
tahoe
is
a
decision
of
this
court
in
which
it
is
recognized
that
tenney
v.
brandhove
is
not
dependent
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
an
evidentiary
privilege
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
there
isn't,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
we
point
out
that
where
there
is
no
underlying
immunity,
there
is
no
need
to
protect
it
with
an
evidentiary
privilege
against
introducing
any
proof
of
any
legislative
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
o'shea
v.
littleton.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
indeed
so.
the
court
has
said
this
on
several
occasions.
and
the
privilege,
the
common
law
privilege,
or
the
common
law
immunity
from
civil
liability,
it
was
recognized
early
in
tenney
v.
brandhove,
and
has
been
refined
in
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court,
is
not
an
absolute
civil
immunity.
it
is
a
civil
immunity
from
damages,
but
not
from
injunctive
relief,
as
this
court
has
indicated
bond
v.
atlanta,
the
case
involving
julian
bond
who
was
elected
to
the
georgia
legislature
and
was
denied
a
seat.
and
this
court
found
no
obstruction
to
ordering
the
legislature
to
seat
him.
which
means
that
the
civil
immunity
is
just
for
money
damages,
and
not
from
injunctive
relief.
contrariwise,
in
the
case
involving
adam
powell,
powell
v.
mccormack,
i
think
it
is,
this
court
said
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
on
the
other
hand,
immunized
the
congress
from
all
liabilities,
civil
and
criminal,
and
in
this
context
of
civil
liability,
from
injunctive
relief.
and
the
relief
ran
against
subordinate
officials
of
the
house,
but
not
against
members
of
the
congress.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
court--i
believe
in
the
brewster
case,
the
court
held
that
there
could
be
no
showing
of
legislative
acts,
but
that
the--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
right.
if
the
charge
could
be
proved
by
evidence
of
non-legislative
acts,
and
he
would
be
liable
for
that.
because
where
there
was
no
immunity,
there
was
no
need
for
a
legislative--for--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
which
is
not,
of
course,
a
legislative
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
for
the
non-immunized
act,
there
is
no
evidentiary
privilege
to
protect.
and
this
is
what--this
is
one
of
the
distinctions
that
this
court
has
made.
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
obviously,
doesn't
apply
in
the
case
of
a
state
legislator.
it
operates
only
at
a
tier
of
the
federal
government.
and
the
state
legislator,
if
at
all,
can
make
some
claim,
as
respondent
does
in
his
brief,
for
considerations
of
federalism.
and
we
urge
in
our
brief
that
the
admission
of
evidence
of
his
legislative
acts
is
not
incompatible
with
the
due
regard
of
the
independent
functioning
of
state
government,
because
state
officials
have
been
prosecuted
in
federal
courts
for
violation
of
the
federal
law,
without
any
suggestion
that
there
is
any
danger
of
interfering
with
the
proper
function
of
state
law,
state
governors,
state
legislators,
state--indeed,
state
judges,
for
federal
offenses,
are
duly
prosecuted.
and
it's
not
like
usery
v.
the
national
league
of
cities
,
where
there
was
an
interference
with
an
essential
function
of
the
state
government.
here--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
so,
and
we
recognize
that.
we
suggest,
however,
that
when
weighed
against
the
desire
for
relevant
evidence,
and
to
prevent
the
criminal
corruption
of
state
government,
that
that
is
a
small
price
to
pay.
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
that
price
should
be
paid,
the
price
of
excluding
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
because
the
members,
persons
who
function
in
state
governments,
are
also
citizens
of
the
federal
government,
and
are
subject
to
its
laws.
they
should
not
be
immunized
from
obedience
to
its
criminal
laws
unless
there
is
a
very
cogent
reason
for
so
doing.
and
it's
never
been
suggested
that
state
governments
cannot
function
and
at
the
same
time
have
their
officers
or
officials
responsive
to
federal
criminal
law.
in
fact,
it
would
be
a
scandalous
proposition.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
correct
--
the
hobbs
act
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
tenney
was
sued
civil.
tenney
was
sued
to
civil
damages.
and
this
court
made
a
judgment
that
the
common
law
immunity
for
liability
from
civil
damages
was
not
too
much
a
price
to
pay
to
allow
him
to
function
in
the
capacity
for
which
be
was
elected.
he
was
not
indicted
for
a
criminal
offense,
which
of
course
is
a
more
serious
matter.
we
point
out
in
our
brief--i
think
the
case
is
united
states
v.
anderson,
or
perhaps
the
style
of
it
is
anderson
v.
united
states--at
page
10
and
we
cite
other
cases
in
other
courts,
united
states
v.
habbitt,
united
states
v.
marzei,
where
regularly
criminal
indictments
against
state
legislators
have
been
conducted
in
the
united
states
courts.
and
it's
never
been
thought,
up
until
this
time,
for
the
consideration
of
this
court,
that
that
could
not
be
done.
and
we
suggest
that
two
of
the
three
lower
federal
courts
that
have
considered
the
proposition
that
rule
501
affords
a
legislative
privilege,
have
decided
that
it
does
not.
the
first
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
en
banc,
reversing
a
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
third
circuit,
by
dictum,
suggest
that
there
may
not
be
such
an
evidentiary
privilege,
until
this
decision,
which
speaks
of
a
"felt
need"
for
this.
but
we
submit
that
the
case
is
not
made
for
the
"felt
need,"
and
that
the
price,
as
we
point
out,
is
too
great
a
price
to
pay.
we
paraphrase
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
our
brief,
saying
that
given
these
overriding
federal
interests,
recognition
of
the
legislative
privilege
would
simply
entail
payment
of
too
high
a
price
for
whatever
minimal
increment
of
security
it
might
give
to
the
mind
of
a
state
legislator.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
not
on
immunity.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
conceded
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
underlying
immunity.
and
this
court
has
held,
and
we
submit
correctly
so,
that
where
there
is
no
underlying
immunity,
there
is
no
need
to
protect
it
with
a
legislative
privilege.
we
suggest,
of
course,
concluding
as
i
began,
that
the
law
is
entitled
to
every
man's
evidence.
and
that
whoever
would
suggest
that
a
privilege
should
keep
out
relevant
evidence,
and
obstruct
the
pursuit
of
truth,
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
it.
we
submit
that
necessity
has
not
been
made
here.
with
leave
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
one
or
two
very
quick
points,
if
i
may.
my
brother
asserts
a
claim
of
immunity
here
for
the
first
time,
as
the
court
has
observed;
and
that's
also
our
understanding.
in
answer
and
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry
about
the
large
number
of
common
law
privileges
that
were
not
carried
over
into
the
federal
common
law,
in
1972
when
privilege--a
number
of
privileges
were
proposed,
superseded
subsequently
by
rule
501,
which
did
not
enumerate
them,
this
privilege
was
not
one
of
those
listed.
and
it
would
appear
that
if
it
were
such
a
fundamental
privilege
that
it
might
have
been
listed
there.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
inquiry
about
the
number
of
pending
prosecutions
of
this
kind,
at
the
time
we
briefed
this
matter,
we
were
aware
of
only
one
other,
a
case
called
united
states
v.
wall,
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit.
there
may
be
others
at
this
time.
we
would
therefore,
asserts
for
the
reasons--several
reasons
that
we
make
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
