you
don't
draw
any
distinction
between
the
criminal
and
the
civil?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
way
you
just
said,
criminal
or
civil,
i
thought--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they're
a
little
different.
the
federal
one
is
in
a
particular,
written
form,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
you
don't
have
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
just
which
section
of
the
constitution
does
it
violate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
before
our
constitution
was
adopted,
the
common
law
was
that
all
legislators,
federal,
state
and
local,
were
covered;
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
congress
adopted
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
which
was
limited
to
congress.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
it
says
congress,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
you
tell
me
why
they
did
that,
why
they
didn't
make
it
broader?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i'm
still
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
can
you
give
me
the
reason
why
it
was
left
out?
