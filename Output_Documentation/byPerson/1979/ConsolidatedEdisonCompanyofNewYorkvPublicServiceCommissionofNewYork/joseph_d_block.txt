mr.
joseph
d.
block
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
which
upheld
that
an
order
of
the
state
public
service
commission
prohibiting
utilities
in
new
york
state
from
communicating
with
their
customers
on
controversial
matters
of
public
policy
by
means
of
messages
enclosed
with
the
utility
bills.
we
call
these
messages
bill
inserts.
the
order
prevented
consolidated
edison
company
and
the
other
utilities
from
communicating
with
their
customers
in
the
most
effective
way
available
on
issues
that
are
directly
related
to
the
company's
business
providing
energy
in
new
york
city
and
westchester
county.
and
these
issues
also
are
--
have
a
direct
impact
on
our
consumer
public.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
did
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
because
we
felt
that
the
order
prevented
us
from
speaking
out
through
the
medium
of
bill
inserts
we
challenged
the
order
below
before
the
commission
and
also
before
the
state
court
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
consolidated
edison
company's
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
also
that
the
reference
in
the
order
to
controversial
matters
of
public
policy
were
so
vague
that
it
brought
into
play
this
rule
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
amendment.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
is
the
only
utility
authorized
to
serve
that
area.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
would
have
to
have
the
permission
of
the
state
public
service
commission
to
enter
our
service
area.
private
building
owners
are
free
without
permission
to
install
their
own
generating
building.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
con
edison
is
protected
from
competition
in
exchange
for
which
it
is
subject
to
very
strict
regulation,
not
only
as
to
its
rates
but
as
to
its
service
and
practically
every
aspect
of
its
business.
and
the
reason
of
course
is
it
is
economically
unsound
to
permit
two
utilities
to
come
into
the
same
area
and
install
the
same
facilities
and
to
compete.
because
of
the
great
amount
of
capital
involved
in
this
business
it
would
be
disadvantageous
to
the
consumer.
this
is
a
matter
of
social
policy
and
it
is
accepted
and
we
do
get
the
benefit
but
we
have
the
obligation.
we
have
the
statutory
obligation
to
render
adequate
and
reliable
service
at
reasonable
cost.
and
it
is
in
pursuance
of
that
business
that
we
feel
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
communicate
with
our
customers
on
issues
that
are
current
and
which
affect
our
ability
to
serve
them
and
which
affect
their
well-being.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
we
are
not.
our
rates
are
fixed
by
the
commission
after
extensive
public
hearings
and
it
is
not
only
our
rates
but,
as
i
say,
every
aspect
of
our
business
is
closely
regulated.
we
think
the
court
below
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
were
a
franchised
monopoly
and
although
they
didn't
say
this
in
their
opinion
there
are
things
in
their
opinion
that
can
only
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
monopoly
status.
and
i
want
to
turn
to
the
court's
opinion
because
they
started
off
by
treating
this
order
of
the
commission
as
a
valid
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
now,
the
virginia
pharmacy
case
that
this
court
decided
in
1976
specified
exactly
what
the
elements
of
a
proper,
time
and
place
and
manner
restriction
area.
and
there
are
three
--
three
requirements,
all
of
which
must
be
present.
the
first
requirement
is
that
the
restriction
of
speech
must
not
be
based
on
the
contents
of
the
speech,
it
must
be
content
neutral.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
restriction
must
serve
a
significant
governmental
interest.
and
the
third
requirement
is
that
in
imposing
such
a
restriction
there
must
be
ample
alternative
channels
of
communication
left
to
the
facility
or
left
to
the
speaker
to
communicate
his
views.
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
this
--
that
the
court
in
saying
that
this
was
not
a
content-based
regulation
committed
a
fundamental
error.
the
restriction
applied
to
controversial
matters
of
public
policy
and,
in
particular,
the
utilities'
viewpoints
on
those
matters.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
they
did
not,
they
did
not
define
it.
when
we
challenged
this
order
by
a
petition
for
rehearing
they
said
that
they
would
give
us
advisory
rulings
if
we
would
come
to
them
and
ask
them
whether
something
was
controversial
or
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
that
is
correct.
they
did
not
--
i
assume
that
they
would
not
regard
that
as
controversial.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
it
is
--
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
know
just
exactly
what
they
did
mean
by
this.
and
we
have
had
problems
with
it
since
the
ban
has
been
in
effect.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
issue
in
the
second
case
that
is
on
the
call
for
this
morning,
the
central
hudson
case.
and
this
order
that
i
speak
of
in
addition
to
banning
inserts
banned
promotional
advertising
by
electric
utilities.
now,
we
did
not
appeal
from
that
part
of
the
order.
other
utilities
did,
including
central
hudson
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
second
case.
the
promotional
advertising
involves
this
matter
of
encouraging
people
to
use
more
electricity
at
a
time
when
conservation
should
be
the
keynote.
that
is
something
that
is
involved
in
the
bill
insert
order
as
such
although
it
may
be
a
controversial
matter
within
the
scope
of
the
bill
insert
prohibition.
but
there
is
a
separate
prohibition
that
is
subject
to
a
separate
appeal
that
we
do
not
regard
that
issue
as
being
involved,
particularly
in
the
bill
insert
case.
the
commission
does
not
want
us
to
speak
out
on
controversial
matters
and
that,
as
i
say,
may
well
include
promotion.
but
we
have
no
--
as
far
as
con
edison
is
concerned
our
desire
is
to
speak
out
on
such
issues
as
whether
some
of
our
plants
should
be
permitted
to
burn
coal
instead
of
high-cost
imported
oil
so
that
we
can
not
only
save
our
customers
some
money
but
can
reduce
this
nation's
dependence
on
foreign
oil,
which
is
a
risky
supply
and
one
that
we
do
not
feel
comfortable
living
with,
because
it
can
be
cut
off
at
any
time.
another
issue
that
we
think
is
important
to
our
customers
and
to
our
business
is
what
is
the
future
of
nuclear
power
now
that
there
has
been
an
accident
at
three
mile
island
and
a
lot
of
investigation.
we
would
like
to
communicate
with
our
customers
telling
them
what
measures
were
taken
to
improve
the
safety
of
our
nuclear
plant
operation.
we
would
like
to
tell
them
about
the
economics
of
nuclear
power
versus
oil.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
no,
i
would
say
that
we
are
forbidden
from
doing
that.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
we
interpret
the
federal
election
campaign
act
as
prohibiting
us
from
seeking
to
--
from
spending
money
to
influence,
to
communicate
with
our
customers
--
communicate
with
our
customers
on
political
candidate
endorsements.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
yes.
we
think
we
are
forbidden,
we
have
no
particular
desire
to
do
that
and
we
don't
think
that
is
--
that
is
something
that
we
don't
think
our
company
should
get
into.
we
want
to
talk
about
issues
and
information.
and
the
ban
is
so
broad
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
tell
us
that
we
can't
support
candidates
or
vote
against
candidates,
it
doesn't
say
that
we
shouldn't
foster
or
try
to
promote
legislation
or
oppose
legislation.
it
tells
us
we
cannot
communicate
at
all
on
controversial
matters
of
public
policy
by
means
of
these
bill
inserts.
and
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
we
have
--
we
have
thousands
of
shareholders.
we
have
i
would
say
300,000
shareholders.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
that
--
that
could
be,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
your
honor,
that
is
an
issue
that
was
handled
and
dealt
with
in
the
bellotti
case
and
we
are
aware
of
that
issue.
the
commission
has
not
purported
to
act
to
protect
an
unwilling
stockholder
from
supporting
these
bill
inserts.
they
have
acted
solely
to
protect
the
customer
from
receiving
these
inserts
if
the
customer
is
unwilling
to
receive
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
we
have
had
no
--
we
have
had
no
registering
of
opposition
by
our
shareholders
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
before
the
ban
was
imposed
we
were
at
liberty
to
use
bill
inserts
to
communicate
with
whoever
we
wanted
to,
our
customers,
our
shareholders.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
and
we
never
--
during
all
this
time
before
the
ban,
for
many
years
we
could
do
this,
before
it
was
foreclosed
in
1977.
we
never
had
any
problems
with
our
shareholders,
not
a
single
shareholders
at
an
annual
meeting
ever
objected
to
our
public
statements
on
this
subject,
on
these
energy
subjects.
and
we
just
haven't
had
any
shareholder
opposition
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
only
applies
to
inserts
sent
out
to
customers.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
the
shareholders?
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
we
don't
--
we
don't
regard
them
as
being
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
--
a
captive
audience,
because
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
we
don't
regard
either
of
them
as
being
captive
but
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
would
say
your
honor
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
no,
your
honor,
he
does
not
get
electricity
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
would
say
that
a
customer
applies
to
us
for
service
and
he
is
entitled
to
service.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
the
customer
pays
for
the
mail,
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
now,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
the
commission
had
issued
an
order
that
was
tailored
to
meet
the
problem
of
unwilling
customers
getting
these
communications,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
they
issued
a
ban
that
applied
to
the
--
we
have
3
million
customers
and
the
majority
of
those
are
probably
very
desirous
of
getting
these
messages.
the
commission
whose
burden
it
was
to
justify
this
regulation
by
showing
a
compelling
and
subordinating
interest,
a
governmental
interest
that
was
important,
the
commission
made
no
showing
whatsoever
as
to
how
many
unwilling
recipients
there
were
likely
to
be.
it
just
assumed
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
that
is
correct,
the
commission
is
the
government
--
is
the
state
agency,
i
think,
under
authority
of
state
law.
and
when
it
issues
a
prohibition
on
speech
it
must
justify
that
prohibition
by
some
--
by
some
state
interest
that
is
seeking
to
protect
and
that
it
has
a
right
to
protect.
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
disharmony
on
that
principle.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
mean
--
i
meant
to
say,
your
honor,
that
it
was
the
commission's
burden,
when
it
imposes
a
restriction
on
speech
such
as
this
one,
it
is
their
burden
to
justify
that
restriction
by
making
a
showing
that
will
withstand
scrutiny
before
a
court,
including
this
court,
withstand
exacting
scrutiny
in
the
language
of
this
court,
decision.
and
as
a
result
of
that
scrutiny
the
court
must
be
satisfied
that
there
is
a
very
important
governmental
interest
that
this
restriction
will
serve.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
the
question
here
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
mean
by
that,
your
honor,
that
the
commission
who
fixes
the
rates
that
we
are
charged
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
--
when
it
fixes
the
rates
it
allows
us
to
recover
through
our
rates
the
costs
of
mailing
out
these
bills.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
insertion
of
an
insert
on
a
controversial
matter
of
public
policy
in
the
same
billing
envelope
would
not
increase
the
postage,
would
not
increase
any
of
the
customers'
costs,
any
costs
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
no,
any
labor
costs
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
--
will
be
paid
by
the
stockholders.
we
have
conceded
that
and
we
do
not
argue
about
that.
we
will
pay
any
additional
costs
that
might
be
involved.
but
the
customer
gets
full
value
in
services
out
of
paying
his
rates
and
after
all
it
is
the
commission
that
fixes
the
rates
and
the
commission
has
control
over
that.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
the
commission
--
i
will
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor:
the
commission
has
said
itself
in
issuing
this
prohibition
that
the
bill
insert
is
a
unique
method
which
enables
utilities
to
communicate
with
the
stockholders.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
is
true
that
they
--
they
do
open
the
billing
envelope
to
get
the
bill.
whether
they
would
open
a
separate
mailing
envelope
is
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
it
is
not
only
the
cost
we
save
by
using
bill
inserts,
it
is
a
proven
fact
that
the
bill
inserts
do
get
into
the
hands
of
the
customers
and
those
who
want
to
read
them
will
read
them;
and
those
who
don't
want
to
bother
with
them
can
throw
them
away.
but
the
bill
insert
coming
in
a
billing
envelope
has
more
effective
potential
to
reach
the
consumer
than
a
separate
mailing.
and
of
course
the
commission
does
not
permit
us
to
make
a
separate
mailing
at
rate-payers'
expense.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
think
we
would
be
running
into
the
problem
of
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
--
a
controversial
matter
and
we
would
be
in
the
position
--\
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
we're
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
there
are
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
think
this
rule
--
this
order
puts
us
in
a
position
where
we
are
not
free
to
criticize
the
commission
that
governs
us,
which
is
not
an
acceptable
state
of
affairs
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
do
not
believe
that
was
considered
to
be
a
controversial
matter
of
public
policy.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
would
--
i
am
really
at
a
loss
to
interpret
this
matter
of
controversial
public
policy.
it
is
so
vague,
i
don't
know
standards
the
commission
has
applied
to
or
will
apply
to
determine
it.
it
seems
to
me
a
totally
subjective
matter
that
the
commission
has
reserved
to
itself.
they
say
for
example
that
energy
conservation
is
something
we
can
tell
our
customers
about
by
means
of
bill
inserts.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
aspects
of
energy
conservation
that
are
controversial,
for
example
keeping
the
thermostats
at
65
degrees
and
78
degrees
has
provoked
a
lot
of
controversy
on
the
part
of
building
owners,
restaurant
owners,
theater
owners,
but
really
can't
speak
in
all
candor
as
to
what
the
commission
means
by
its
prohibition.
i
would
say
if
we
were
just
opening
up
a
new
plant
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
our
customers
that
without
running
into
a
problem
with
this
order.
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
the
order
reads
that
we
are
forbidden
from
expressing
our
position
on
controversial
matters.
it
doesn't
say
that
we
are
not
able
to
publish
somebody
else's
opinion.
but
that
would
be
a
question
of
whether
when
we
publish
somebody
else's
opinion
we
are
in
fact
taking
it
as
our
own
and
making
it
our
own
and
violating
the
order.
so
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
well,
i
think
it
probably
does.
again,
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
the
commission
would
say
but
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
a
matter
of
public
debate
then
it
probably
is
a
controversial
subject,
even
though
it
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
first
amendment
has
been
held
by
this
court
repeatedly
to
promote
debate
and
to
have
a
robust,
uninhibited
debate
on
matters
that
are
controversial.
now,
what
the
commission
said
here
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
here
is
that
we
should
--
we
are
limited
by
the
commission's
order
to
publishing
the
innocuous
and
non-controversial.
and
the
court
thought
that
was
all
right.
but
i
think
is
a
sad
state
of
affairs
when
we
have
to
operate
under
a
restriction
that
limits
us
to
publishing
something
that
is
innocuous.
i
wanted
to
answer
one
question
about
the
shareholders.
since
what
we
have
to
talk
about
with
our
customers
in
these
bill
inserts
is
related
to
the
company's
business
i
feel
that
these
communications
are
in
the
stockholders'
interest.
we
are
acting
for
our
stockholders
when
we
are
communicating
with
our
customers
on
issues
that
are
corporate
in
nature,
that
are
intimately
related
to
our
business
and
are
not
like
the
situation
in
bellotti
where
there
was
a
state
income
tax
and
the
question
was,
well,
is
this
something
that
is
a
part
of
the
bank's
business
so
they
should
have
full
first
amendment
protection.
we
feel
we
are
talking
here
about
issues
that
are
related
to
the
company's
business
and
are
being
communicated
in
behalf
of
our
shareholders.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
believe
it
is
--
i
believe
those
two
situations
are
the
same.
i
believe
--
i
believe
the
fact
we
are
regulated
i
think
is
not
--
is
not
something
that
places
us
in
the
position
where
we
have
lesser
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
i
think
the
commission
did
rest
on
that
ground
and
i
think
they
are
wrong,
because
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
we
are
a
regulated
monopoly
should
cause
this
court
to
say
that
we
don't
have
first
amendment
rights
on
issues
related
to
the
company's
business
where
the
commission
has
not
shown
a
single
governmental
interest
that
will
be
protected
by
this
ban.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
say
that
because
we
are
a
monopoly
we
can
be
subject
--
subjected
to
this
restriction.
they
thought
we
were
invading
the
privacy
of
customers.
but
the
ban
does
not
prohibit
us
from
direct
mailing,
so
the
privacy
could
still
be
invaded
by
--
with
this
ban
in
effect,
the
ban
will
not
accomplish
its
purpose
it
doesn't
prohibit
us
from
going
door
to
door
as
this
court
allowed
recently
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
block
or
advertising.
but
it
did
take
away
from
us
an
effective
means
and
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred,
and
i
will
have
to
rely
on
our
brief
for
the
arguments
we
make
to
show
that
the
various
governmental
interests
which
the
state
here
is
reaching
out
in
attempting
to
rest
on
as
a
justification
for
this
order
are
totally
without
merit.
mr.
joseph
d.
block
nothing
further,
your
honor.
