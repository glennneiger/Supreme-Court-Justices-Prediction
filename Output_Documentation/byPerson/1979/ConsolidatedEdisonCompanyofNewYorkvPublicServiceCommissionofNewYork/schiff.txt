mr.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
initiated
before
the
commission
by
a
complaint
of
consumers
of
consolidated
edison
who
were
members
of
the
natural
resources
defense
council
and
other
groups
and
some
individually
who
complained
of
basically
an
infringement
of
their
first
amendment
rights
when
consolidated
edison
had
published
their
views
on
the
merits
of
nuclear
power;
and
request
was
made
that
the
persons
who
had
opposing
views
be
given
an
opportunity
to
present
their
views
in
a
subsequent
bill
insert
of
consolidated
edison.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
--
yes,
i
think
the
commission
has
barred
the
use
of
the
billing
envelope
from
dissemination
of
controversial
subject
matter
views.
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
is
that
the
commission
is
very
much
concerned
that
the
bill
inserts
be
used
for
messages
specifically
related
to
the
needs
of
the
customers
who
are
paying
for
these
bill
inserts
and
that
there
is
limited
space
involved.
so
that
as
i
will
discuss
a
little
bit
more
later,
one
of
the
alternatives
that
the
commission
had
before
it,
which
mr.
block
has
not
addressed
himself
to
at
all,
is
the
possibility
of
opening
up
the
billing
packet
as
a
general
forum
for
controversial
views.
that
posed
some
additional
problems,
there
were
still
some
captive
audience
questions
there,
it
would
use
up
the
billing
space
even
more
so
and
would
detract
from
the
possibility
of
the
utility
providing
messages
to
the
utility
customers
on
matters
such
as
what
are
your
new
rates
going
to
be,
what
are
your
rights
as
a
consumer
in
case
there
is
cutoff
of
service.
we
require
the
utilities
at
least
once
a
year
to
tell
the
customers
about
their
rights
as
consumers
and
that
is
supposed
to
be
done
in
the
billing
insert.
the
legislature
has
indicated
that
we
should
require
them
to
tell
customers
about
new
rate
proposals.
we
signed
a
state
law
the
utilities
have
an
obligation
to
tell
the
consumers
about
the
possibility
of
conserving
energy
in
the
process
of
using
utility
service,
both
gas
and
electricity.
there
is
a
need
for
safety
information
as
to
how
to
not
use
your
equipment
to
prevent
gas
explosions
and
the
like.
this
is
a
kind
of
information
that
the
commission
believes
the
bill
inserts
should
be
restricted
for,
should
be
--
or
should
be
used
for.
perhaps
it
is
not
even
restricted
but
that
is
what
we
believe
is
the
proper
use
for
this.
they
can
of
course
include
general
informational
information
relevant
to
utility
service.
mr.
schiff
yes,
your
honor;
it
does
so,
and
has
done
so.
mr.
schiff
well,
the
commission
certainly
classifies
advertising
expenses
as
those
which
can
be
collected
from
rate-payers
so-called
above-the-line
expenses
and
those
which
may
not
be
collected.
mr.
schiff
well,
in
the
order
reviewed
upon
here
the
commission
adopted
in
1977
it
established
a
policy
that
it
would
allow
utilities
a
certain
percentage
of
their
revenues
as
what
they
could
include
--
what
they
would
be
allowed
in
advertising
for
--
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
trying
to
determine,
looking
backwards
when
we
are
setting
rates
for
the
future.
but
we
include
an
allowance.
now,
the
commission
has
never
--
mr.
schiff
right.
mr.
schiff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
schiff
that
is
right.
mr.
schiff
a
--
mr.
schiff
within
limits.
well,
the
commission
has
divided
the
advertising
into
several
different
categories,
as
the
order
shows.
the
percentage
applies
to
institutional
and
informational
advertising.
there
is
a
category
which
doesn't
apply
right
now
to
the
electric
utilities
that
would
be
promotion
and
we
might
allow
something
separate
if
it
appears
that
promotion
is
desirable
from
a
rate-payer's
point
of
view.
the
political
advertising
has
never
been
allowed
to
be
collected
from
the
rate-payers.
and
that
division
has
been
made
in
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
both
of
our
commission
and
those
of
the
federal
commissions
and
most
of
the
state
commissions
and
drawing
the
distinction
between
political
and
non-political.
and
political
has
included
the
matters
of
--
controversial
matters
of
public
policy.
obviously
it
is
not
entirely
easy
to
always
separate
them
but
--
mr.
schiff
--
it
is
a
classification
--
mr.
schiff
yes,
yes,
is
broader
than
that.
one
of
the
matters
that
it
is
plainly
related
to,
for
example,
is
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
public
take-overs
or
public
power
should
be
established.
and,
indeed,
consolidated
edison
last
fall
spent
something
in
the
nature
of
a
million
dollars
in
opposing
the
referendum
in
westchester
county
that
might
have
led
to
public
power
in
westchester
county.
mr.
schiff
absolutely.
mr.
schiff
yes.
right.
they
are
not
rate-payer
expenses.
mr.
schiff
i
mention
those
because
it
does
demonstrate
that
the
ban
which
we
have
made
on
bill
inserts
is
a
fairly
limited
ban.
it
does
not
attempt
to
prevent
utilities
from
expressing
their
views.
this
is
not
the
bellotti
case.
mr.
schiff
yes
--
mr.
schiff
well,
i
think
that
may
--
mr.
schiff
well,
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
better
word
but
if
it
is
a
matter
of
law
that
these
are
the
limitations
on
what
people
should
be
limiting
their
thermostats
to
it
may
not
be
controversial
once
congress
has
adopted
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
go
that
far.
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
what
--in
terms
of
urging
them
to
encourage
conservation,
i
think
we
would
tell
them
that
--
should
tell
the
consumers
the
benefits
or
how
you
can
conserve
and
not
be
basically
that
much
less
uncomfortable.
there
are
lots
of
ways.
you
can
install
installation
and
in
new
york
as
well
under
the
federal
law
the
utilities
are
providing
lending
money
so
that
their
customers
can
conserve
through
installation
of
insulation,
through
furnace
improvements,
storm
windows
and
the
like.
that
is
the
kind
of
conservation
of
--
mr.
schiff
well,
yes,
some
of
it
would
--
mr.
schiff
--
apply
to
apartments.
mr.
schiff
no,
i
assume
it
probably
would
not.
the
standard
that
we
have
here
is,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
not
materially
different
from
that
which
has
been
used
in
terms
of
uniform
system
of
accounts
for
years.
it
is
also
very
similar
to
the
standard
that
this
court
approved
in
the
red
lion
case,
fcc
matters.
so
that
i
would
be
a
fool
to
tell
you
that
this
is
a
standard
that
can
be
defined
very
easily.
but
we
--
also
i
think
the
fact
that
we
have
told
the
utilities
that
they
can
come
to
us
and
get
ready
rulings
is
an
important
consideration
when
you
recognize
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
small
number
of
utility
--
monopoly
utilities
where
bill
inserts
are
not
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment.
mr.
schiff
no.
i
am
not
--
if
it
was
sent
separately
and
could
be
charged
to
the
customer,
our
restriction
would
not
apply
when
it
is
being
sent
separately.
mr.
schiff
no,
no,
but
we
are
--
mr.
schiff
well,
under
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
the
controversial
advertising
would
be
charged
below
the
line.
i
mean
that
sort
of
--
one
follows
the
other.
mr.
schiff
it
has
not
been
for
years,
mr.
justice
white.
i
mean
it
is
not
supposed
to
have
been.
now,
there
may
be
some
issues
at
times
as
to
what
is
controversial
and
what
is
not.
but
if
it
is
concluded
that
it
is
controversial,
the
utility
--
mr.
schiff
well,
you
asked
--
mr.
schiff
i
think
a
lot
of
information
--
mr.
schiff
i
think
a
lot
of
informational
advertising
--
if
they
are
saying
--
mr.
schiff
information.
if
they
tell
their
customers
that
we
are
challenging
an
order
of
the
public
service
commission
in
court,
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
controversial.
i
mean
this
is
information.
the
informational
part
of
our
order
which
appears
at
--
or
if
they
say
--
mr.
schiff
i
think
that
would
be
informational
advertising.
mr.
schiff
information,
not
advertising.
that
would
not
be
controversial.
we
are
stating
the
fact
as
to
what
the
status
of
the
utility
is
and
the
commission's
order
said
so.
mr.
schiff
that
is
right
and
we
--
mr.
schiff
yes,
because
this
is
a
problem
of
the
bill
insert.
i
mean
we
regard
this,
the
courts
below
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
companion
case
all
viewed
this
as
being
essentially
--
mr.
schiff
no,
you
can
just
avoid
the
--
mr.
schiff
you
can
disseminate
your
views
by
sending
it
separately
or
by
having
a
newspaper
advertisement.
mr.
schiff
the
company's
expense
that
is
right.
mr.
schiff
well,
this
was
an
alternative
proposal
which,
as
i
say,
the
petitioners
who
started
this
case
and
who
are
represented
by
miss
glen
over
at
the
counsel
table
urged,
the
commission
concluded
that
on
balance
because
of
the
limited
space
of
these
bill
inserts
if
you
start
putting
too
much
in
there,
then
you
are
going
to
have
additional
postage,
you
are
going
to
have
additional
work
putting
it
in.
mr.
schiff
well,
all
right
--
mr.
schiff
the
commission
concluded
that
neither
the
utilities
nor
the
commission
could
really
administer
in
view
of
the
kind
of
role
that
we
have,
could
practically
administer
this
kind
of
a
public
forum.
we
do
think
--
the
commission
said
that
we
had
considered
this
and
some
of
the
commissioners
had
thought
that
this
might
be
a
better
way
rather
than
preventing
the
utilities
from
using
the
bill
insert
was
to
open
it
up
to
both
views
in
the
manner
that
you
have
described.
and
we
concluded
that
that
was
a
less
desirable
provision
because
--
mr.
schiff
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
the
commission's
order
--
mr.
schiff
yes,
if
you
look
at
the
ordering
clause
itself
--
mr.
schiff
well,
i
suppose
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
schiff
--
the
commission's
order
in
fact
was
rested
--
one
of
the
basically
4
or
5
grounds,
depending
on
how
you
want
to
divide
them,
was
that
the
opening
up
of
a
public
forum
in
this
matter
would
--
mr.
schiff
they
decided
not
to
do
that--
mr.
schiff
well,
if
you
read
it
very
narrowly
--
mr.
schiff
well,
the
commission's
opinion,
which
i
think
has
to
be
read
into
the
commission's
order,
made
it
quite
clear
that
that
alternative
had
been
rejected
--
mr.
schiff
--
as
really
being
permissive,
because
it
would
--
it
goes
to
the
same
problem.
it
still
imposes
on
a
captive
audience.
it
uses
up
the
space
that
is
needed
to
provide
the
proper
message.
mr.
schiff
no,
i
said
it
related
to
matters
--
mr.
schiff
--
matters
of
public
controversy.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
schiff
well--
mr.
schiff
i
agree.
the
order
by
its
terms,
and
the
--
mr.
schiff
well,
as
i
say,
if
your
read
the
context
of
the
commission's
order
very
narrowly,
i
would
agree
that
that
is
correct.
i
guess
i
am
saying
that
the
court
should
in
making
the
decision
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
would
be
a
forum,
because
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
commission
used
for
objecting
--
for
making
its
decision.
but
i
cannot
disagree
that
if
you
didn't
reach
that
that
we
probably
would
have
to
issue
a
new
order.
but
i
think
it
is
very
much
part
of
this
case.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
are
really
not
in
disagreement.
i
think
that
we
agree
that
we
certainly
considered
it
as
an
integral
part
of
the
reasoning
for
reaching
our
decision.
but
that
the
ordering
clause
as
such
did
not
impose
that
requirement.
mr.
schiff
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
--
it
might
be
a
new
order
but
i
would
assume
that
that
is
what
the
commission
would
say,
it
is
consistent
with--
mr.
schiff
i
would
agree
that
in
terms
it
doesn't
ban
the
public
forum.
i
would
say
--
mr.
schiff
well,
the
commission
concluded
that
there
should
be
a
time
space
manner
restriction
here
because
of
a
number
of
reasons,
one
of
which
was
a
limited
space
in
general.
one
of
then,
which
the
court
of
appeals
discussed,
primarily
is
that
the
problems
of
imposing
on
a
captive
audience
of
views
that
the
customers
may
not
agree
with.
another
reason
is
that
essentially
on
the
company's
views
is
that
the
customers
would
be
required
essentially
to
pay
for
the
views
of
somebody
else
and
this
matter,
the
fact
this
is
a
utility
which
is
a
monopoly
is
crucial
just
as
in
the
next
case
on
promotion.
monopolies
are
very
different
from
other
credit
--
other
companies
that
may
send
out
billing
inserts.
you
don't
have
any
choice,
you
get
your
heat
cut
off
if
you
don't
look
at
the
bill.
mr.
schiff
i
think
that
you
probably
have
to
view
it
that
the
order
per
se
does
not
but
that
the
public
forum
issue
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
commission
reached
that
conclusion,
because
the
commission
expressly
concluded
--
mr.
schiff
no,
--
well,
i
disagree
but
your
honors
will
have
to
decide
how
you
do
it.
it
is
here
in
the
sense
that
one
of
the
reasons
--
one
of
the
important
reasons
that
the
commission
used
for
not
permitting
this
is
that
the
alternative
of
having
a
public
forum
was
even
less
desirable.
it
is
still
--
what
we
have
done
here,
the
commission
has
basically
imposed
the
least
first
amendment
restriction,
because
this
case
is
a
matter
of
balancing
competing
first
amendment
interest
of
the
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
consumers
on
the
other
hand.
and
--
mr.
schiff
well,
it
--
mr.
schiff
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
schiff
well,
the
problem
with
that
suggestion,
which
has
been
made
by
long
island
lighting
company,
is
that
there
are
matters
that
should
be
in
these
bill
inserts
that
the
customers
--
the
state
has
concluded
they
should
be
receiving
and
that
are
important
to
them,
like
what
happens
if
you
have
the
complaint
about
utility
service.
what
are
your
general
rights
in
dealing
with
utilities.
this
is
not
like
some
other
--
mr.
schiff
well,
there
is
no
practical
way
of
having
different
inserts
sent
to
some
customers
than
other
customers.
one
suggestion
has
been
made,
perhaps
jokingly,
that
let
the
customer
send
it
back
and
then
if
he
got
any
more
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
his
bill.
but
even
that
would
be
undesirable.
mr.
schiff
yes,
yes.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
schiff
but
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
schiff
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
it
should
be
banned.
i
take
it
you
could
say
open
it
up
as
a
public
forum
and
that
technically
it
isn't
reached
here.
but
i
don't
think
that
over-breadth
strictly
should
apply
here.
i
think
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say
in
my
limited
time
--
remaining
time
is
that
as
we
say
in
our
brief
and
the
courts
below
have
held,
that
this
case
is
in
our
view
not
strictly
speaking
content
related.
it
is
subject
matter
content
neutral,
very
much
like
the
case
of
lehman
v.
shaker
heights,
the
one
involving
the
placards
on
the
buses.
so
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
schiff
well,
but
it
is
even-handed.
its
subject
--
mr.
schiff
well,
that
is
what
this
court
also
affirmed
in
the
--
recognized
in
the
shaker
heights
case.
at
the
same
time
in
that
case
the
dissenters
took
the
view
that
the
forum
really
couldn't
have
been
open
at
all,
i
think.
and
here
we
--
at
least
we
don't,
we
are
not
opening
up
a
forum,
so
that
there
are
a
considerable
line
of
cases
supporting
that
view.
mr.
schiff
no,
i
imagine
that
in
terms
of
--
the
answer
would
be
clearly
"no"
i
think
it
would
be
violated.
mr.
schiff
well,
because
public
utilities
don't
have
the
communication
function.
in
this
case
it
is
clear
that
we
--
mr.
schiff
well,
we
are
not
--
yes,
only
in
the
bill
insert,
your
honor.
we
are
letting
them
speak
freely
in
this
case
--
mr.
schiff
well,
the
captive
audience
and
the
free
ride.
i
think
basically
what
the
record
shows
is
that
if
the
utilities
are
paying
an
allocated
share
of
the
postage
that
other
means
of
communication
would
be
cheaper.
their
objective
here
is
simply
to
get
something
cheaper.
and
even
under
state
law
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
--
mr.
schiff
well,
that
is
one
of
the
bases.
there
are
a
series
of
grounds
here.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
have
tried
to
argue
all
of
them.
we
have
argued
all
of
them
in
the
brief
and
--
mr.
schiff
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
still
have
the
problem
--
that
is
an
alternative
but
it
still
poses
a
--
mr.
schiff
--
captive
audience
problem.
it
is
still
a
captive
audience
problem.
mr.
schiff
well,
its
--
mr.
schiff
it
is
not
feasible,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
bill
inserts
do
have
a
role
under
state
law
--
i
think
a
proper
role
under
state
law
to
have
the
utility
in
this
provide
information
on
the
kind
of
information
drec
directly
related
to
consumers.
the
consumers,
if
they
say
don't
send
us
bill
inserts,
won't
get
any
information.
and
and
--
mr.
schiff
well,
i
understand
that
is
a
proposal
that
the
utilities
who
did
make
the
first
alternative
that
you
suggest
it
made,
did
not
make
that
proposal.
and
it
is
so
expensive
to
administer
that
it
would
be
of
no
avail,
i
think,
your
honor.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
turn
of
the
commission.
thank
you.
mr.
schiff
well,
it
is
unlikely.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
like
the
60
because
it
is
so
"iffy"
and
i
think
in
the
circumstances
--
i
don't
think
--
if
they
did
that
i
assume
it
would
create
a
controversy.
mr.
schiff
it
would
create
a
controversy
--
mr.
schiff
--
at
the
inception
so
that
perhaps
i
would
like
to
ask
the
--
have
them
ask
the
commission
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
were
ever
so
foolish
as
to
make
that
recommendation.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
probably
is
not.
it
may
be
informational.
i
really
don't
think
that
would
--
my
own
view.
and
i
would
not
regard
it
as
controversial
as
such.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
think
it
did
in
the
context
i
do
believe
that
it
is
not
possible
to
set
down
a
standard
that
will
deal
with
each
and
every
topic.
the
commission's
order
does
talk
about
the
informational
matters
that
can
be
discussed
and
i
can
think,
like
you
can,
of
matters
in
the
gray
area
dealing
with
the
utility.
and
i
recognize
that
when
in
first
amendment
terms
this
poses
a
problem
i
do
think
that
it
poses
much
less
of
a
problem
when
dealing
with
the
monopoly
--
wanting
to
perhaps
put
things
in
bill
inserts
where
there
is
a
lot
of
thought
given
to
it
before
you
put
something
in
there.
i
don't
think
this
really
goes
to
the
core
of
the
speech
restriction
and
that
there
is
--
there
are
important
problems
in
how
we
can
deal
with
regulated
monopolies,
entities
that
you
have
not
previously
considered
in
these
speech
cases.
mr.
schiff
well,
not
in
the
record.
my
recollection
is
that
we
did
not
think
that
they
should
come
in
each
time;
no.
mr.
schiff
well,
i
think
the
content
of
your
question,
i
mean
i
don't
think
we
would
say:
well,
tell
us
anything.
but
i
mean
of
course
asking
for
advice
is
not
necessarily
dissimilar
to
that.
sometimes
on
the
kind
of
information
they
do
give
consumers
we
ask
to
look
at
that
information
beforehand,
like
the
consumer
rights.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
it
does
properly
convey
what
their
rights
are
and
we
have
looked
at
that
kind
of
information.
the
commission
is
very
much
involved
in
this
billing
packet
which
is
very
much
the
consumers.
thank
you.
