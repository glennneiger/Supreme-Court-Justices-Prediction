unknown
speaker
suppose
that
you
put
a
stuffer
in
the
bills
just
informing
the
consumers
of
the
fact
that
con
ed
had
opened
a
nuclear
power
plant;
nothing
more,
just
pure
informational
material.
in
your
view
would
that
be
banned
by
the
commission's
order?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
other
hand
suppose
it
were
directed
to
the
opening
of
a
new
coal-powered
plant,
same
thing,
same
answer?
unknown
speaker
could
you
enclose
a
small
pamphlet
reproducing
an
essay
or
an
article
by
some
scientist
on
the
advantages
of
developing
oil
shale
as
a
source?
unknown
speaker
a
good
many
environmental
organizations
are
opposing
the
development
of
oil
shale.
now,
does
that
make
it
controversial?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
is
claiming
a
right
to
--
generally
to
keep
sellers
from
putting
inserts
in
their
bills?
let
us
suppose
that
the
banking
commission
said
that
credit
card
companies
shall
not
stuff
their
bills
to
their
card
holders
with
controversial
matters.
does
this
decision
rest
on
a
ground
broad
enough
to
sustain
that
kind
of
a
--
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
commission
purported
to
rest
on
the
ground
that
it
could
do
this
because
you
were
regulated?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
state
courts,
they
rested
on
that
too,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
or
advertising.
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
schiff.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
include
in
the
mailing
not
the
views
of
consolidated
edison
as
such
but
the
views
of
admiral
rickover
or
some
other
scientist
or
some
energy
expert,
would
that
be
barred
too?
unknown
speaker
and
that
kind
of
information
that
you
just
described,
your
commission
has
power
to
compel
the
petitioner
to
send
in
its
billing
envelopes,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
does
your
commission
have
power
generally
to
limit
the
advertising
expenditures
of
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
dollar
figure
on
that
above-the-line,
or
below-the
line,
or
does
it
depend
upon
the
content
of
the
advertising
or
the
nature
of
the
advertising?
unknown
speaker
a
percentage
of
their
receipts
--
unknown
speaker
--
they
can
spend
on
advertising
to
your
client
at
the
cost
of
the
rate-payers?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
exceeds
that
percentage,
then
it
is
a
cost
to
the
stockholders.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
the
nature
or
the
content
of
the
advertising
--
unknown
speaker
--
within
--
unknown
speaker
the
political
--
unknown
speaker
--
is
broader
than
partisan
political.
unknown
speaker
those
expenditures
were
taxable
to
the
stockholders,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it
is
kind
of
broad,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
for
example,
you
would
normally
say
that
to
urge
people
to
have
65
degrees
in
the
winter
and
78
in
the
summer
was
within
any
consolidated
edison
business;
is
that
right?
but
you
wouldn't
say
it
was
controversial,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
or
if
you
can't
get
a
better
word
than
"controversial,"
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
a
large
number
of
con
edison's
customers
live
in
apartments
--
unknown
speaker
--
with
broken
windows.
unknown
speaker
with
broken
windows.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
this
prohibition
would
ever
cover
a
communication
which
if
it
were
sent
separately
could
be
charged
to
the
customer?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
quite
follow,
does
it,
that
just
because
it
can
be
charged
to
the
customer
it
isn't
controversial?
unknown
speaker
i
would
suppose
that
some
of
the
above-the-line
advertising
is
about
controversial
sayings
but
it
is
still
chargeable
to
the
customer.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
me
is
that
nothing
--
no
advertising
or
no
communication
about
a
controversial
element
is
ever
chargeable
to
the
customer?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
matter
of
information
about
a
controversial
matter
--
unknown
speaker
--
being
covered
by
the
prohibition.
suppose
they
just
tell
the
customers,
well,
here
is
what
is
happening
up
in
albany
about
a
matter
that
protects
our
company?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
very,
very
controversial
in
albany.
unknown
speaker
advertising
--
this
is
just
information.
unknown
speaker
if
they
say
we
have
--
we
have
just
opened
a
new
nuclear
energy
facility
and
it
was
sacked
by
a
mob?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
--
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
really
saying
that
"controversial"
means
that
the
company
is
transmitting
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
gave
both
sides
of
an
argument
but
included
the
company's
opinion,
it
would
be
banned,
it
would
be
under
this
--
unknown
speaker
so
in
effect
what
you
are
saying
is
you
can't
avoid
the
above-
and
the
below-line
accounting
by
sticking
this
stuff
in
a
bill?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying
then
--
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
send
it
separately
it
is
at
your
expense,
not
the
customers'.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
pamphlet
that
gives
--
purports
to
give
the
pro's
and
con's
of
developing
a
nuclear
source
of
energy?
unknown
speaker
let
us
stay
with
it.
no
additional
postage,
the
pamphlet
folded
over,
pro's
and
con's
--
unknown
speaker
--
equal
number
of
lines.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
schiff,
that
is
not
to
say
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
if
the
utility
should
choose
to
do
this
it
would
be
covered
by
this
order.
it
wouldn't
be,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
this
order
covers
the
utility's
position
on
controversial
matters
of
public
policy.
unknown
speaker
the
order
does
not
prevent
the
utility
from
doing
what
the
commission
decided
not
to
require
them
to
do.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
considered
by
the
commission
as
something
that
they
considered
as
requiring
the
utility
to
do.
they
decided
not
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
utility
is
not
free
to
do
it
so
far
as
this
order
goes,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
read
it
any
way
you
want
to.
unknown
speaker
as
a
requirement.
unknown
speaker
you
told
me
a
while
ago
that
this
ban
was
restricted
to
matters
that
contained
the
company's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought
you
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
you
expressly
and
you
indicated
that
it
was
limited
to
things
giving
the
company's
opinion,
and
now
you
say
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
the
order
by
its
terms
is
confined
to
dissemination
of
the
utility's
position.
unknown
speaker
if
you
wanted
to
prevent
a
utility
from
doing
what
was
suggested
in
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
have
to
issue
a
new
order
or
amend
this
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
you
have
said
though
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
the
commission
has
given
an
opinion
which
would
be
quite
different
from
his
reading
of
the
order
by
its
own
terms.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
after
listening
to
this
argument
the
utility
would
like
to
send
out
a
two-side
pamphlet,
just
giving
the
chief
justice's
example,
both
sides
of
a
question.
and
it
said,
"i
hear
that
we
can
get
an
early
ruling
on
whether
this
is
covered
by
your
ban."
what
would
be
the
answer
of
the
commission?
i
take
it
you
would
say
the
commission
would
say,
"you
may
not
send
it
out."
unknown
speaker
but
here,
your
content
here
we
should
take
the
order
that
we
are
ruling
on
as
not
banning
the
public
forum?
unknown
speaker
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
commission
has
not
banned
the
public
forum,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
do
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
order
does
not
ban
the
public
forum
mailing
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
public
forum
issue
is
not
here
then,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
consumer's
first
amendment
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
right
not
to
have
this
privacy
invaded,
as
you
put
it
earlier?
unknown
speaker
then
what
if
the
companies
put
a
little
card
in
with
return
postage
and
say,
"if
you
do
not
want
inserts
with
your
bill
all
you
have
to
do
is
return
this
card
and
we
won't
put
any
inserts
in
your
bill"?
unknown
speaker
let
us
change
the
return
card.
let
it
specify
just
in
terms
of
the
commission
order
any
controversial--
unknown
speaker
you
are
familiar
with
the
talk
about
over-breadth
in
some
first
amendment
cases,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
thought
that
this
order
covered
public
forum
mailings
and
that
that
restriction
was
invalid.
would
the
entire
order
be
invalid
then,
as
it
being
over-broad?
or
do
you
think
over-breadth
applies
in
this
context
at
all?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
said
in
our
minds
the
public
forum
mailing
is
bad,
the
mailing
of
the
company's
opinion
about
a
controversial
matter
could
be
banned
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
would
--
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
would
that
order
be
bad
in
its
entirety?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
that
possibly
be
true
when
this
is
not
a
general
ban
against
stuffing,
it
is
a
ban
against
stuffing
only
materials
that
have
a
certain
content?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
it
is
even-handed
in
the
sense
that
it
make
a
category
and
applies
the
same
rule
to
everything
within
the
category.
unknown
speaker
you
have
drawn
an
analogy
to
the
federal
com
[illegible
words]
and
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
that
i
understand
[illegible
words]
to
your
argument.
[illegible
word]
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
be
violated
if
the
fcc
said
there
shall
be
no
use
of
radio
or
television
for
discussion
of
controversial
subjects?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
--
unknown
speaker
they
are
asserting
it
in
this
case,
they
are
asserting
the
right
to
censor.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
because
you
have
the
captive
audience
we
are
going
to
tell
you
what
you
can
say.
unknown
speaker
your
rationale
for
doing
it
is
totally
non-economic,
as
i
understand
it.
you
are
not
going
to
allow
them
to
make
a
one-sided
use
of
the
captive
audience.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one
you
have
argued.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
explained
why
your
least
restrictive
alternative
isn't
--
why
shouldn't
that
have
applied;
if
you
had
just
said
if
you
want
to
mail
these
things,
pay
your
share
of
the
postage.
you
say
you
felt
they
wouldn't
have
done
it
then
so
that
would
have
achieved
that
end.
unknown
speaker
but
you
--
unknown
speaker
you
still
haven't
answered
the
question
about
the
cards,
the
return
cards,
except
to
say
that
it
wasn't
feasible.
you
surely
have
not
persuaded
me
that
it
is
not
feasible.
unknown
speaker
it
was
found
feasible
in
the
rowan
case.
unknown
speaker
i
specified
that
the
card
would
say:
i
don't
want
any
information
from
you
about
oil
shale,
nuclear
energy
or
any
other
alternative
sources
of
energy
or
any
controversial
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
schiff,
i
am
afraid
we
have
not
given
you
much
of
an
opportunity
to
make
your
argument
but
you
have
filed
your
brief
and
we
will
consider
that
of
course.
having
said
that,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question:
would
the
commission's
ban
prevent
con
ed
from
including
a
bill
insert
that
recommended
that
all
thermostats
be
set
at
60
degrees?
your
brief
urges
that
conservation
is
a
subject
as
to
which
information
should
be
supplied
consumers.
would
the
ban
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
said
62
degrees
or
64.
unknown
speaker
it
sure
would.
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
well
but
suppose
to
just
change
the
example
they
said
energy
will
be
saved
by
turning
off
your
lights
at
night
but
don't
forget
there
is
a
lot
of
risk
of
burglary
and
so
forth
and
balancing
between
one
or
the
other
it
is
the
utility's
position
that
we
favor
leaving
the
lights
on.
that
would
be
controversial
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
some
of
your
responses
would
indicate
that
the
commission
may
have
not
thought
this
problem
through
entirely.
unknown
speaker
did
the
commission
consider
the
possibility
of
making
the
utilities
file
each
time
they
wanted
to
put
something
in
the
bill?
unknown
speaker
not
with
respect
to
things
you
have
ordered
in
the
mail
but
in
other
--
