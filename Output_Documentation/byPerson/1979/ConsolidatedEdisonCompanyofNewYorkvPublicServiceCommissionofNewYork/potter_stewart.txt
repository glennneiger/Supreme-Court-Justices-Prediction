mr.
block,
do
you
contend
you
would
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
tell
your
customers
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate
in
the
presidential
election?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
suppose
a
particular
candidate
is
hostile
to
atomic
energy
and
you
are
in
favor
of
atomic
energy
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
that
is
because
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
your
company
has
thousands
of
shareholders,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
are
talking
about
controversial
subjects,
however
that
may
be
defined,
at
least
sort
of
by
definition
some
of
your
shareholders
will
disagree
with
the
position
that
the
company
takes,
won't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
controversial
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
should
prevail
here,
then
that
problem
suggested
by
our
colloquy
would
be
around
the
next
corner,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
been
forbidden
to
do
this.
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
been
doing
this,
have
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
a
stockholder
can
always
sell
his
stock
but
unless
if
somebody
wants
to
freeze
to
death
--
he
can't
do
it
without
electricity.
justice
potter
stewart
paid
by
the
stockholders.
