mr.
block,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
customer
pays
for
these
mailings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
cost
of
mailing
the
bills
undoubtedly
is
an
expense.
is
that
expense
augmented
or
increased
by
including
these
inserts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
suppose
that
--
and
this
is
a
straight
supposition
--
let
us
just
suppose
that
you
could
also
collect
the
cost
from
somebody,
like
the
customer,
for
a
separate
mailing
of
the
same
material.
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
there
some
special
reason
you
want
to
include
the
materials
in
the
bill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
a
sense
it
enables
them
without
further
expense
to
communicate
with
the
stockholders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
is
it
just
money
that
that
is
involved
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
if
you
put
in
a
bill
a
review
of
the
commission's
last
decision
in
your
case
and
said,
"this
is
a
terrible
decision
and
the
commissioners
really
don't
know
what
they
are
doing,
i
suppose
you
would
be
breaking
this
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
a
controversial
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
think
of
some
people
who
would
controvert
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
put
something
in
an
envelope
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
the
commission
wouldn't
agree
with
you.
