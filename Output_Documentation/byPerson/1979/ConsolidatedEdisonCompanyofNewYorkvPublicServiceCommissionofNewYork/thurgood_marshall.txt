marshall
where
would
he
get
his
gas
if
he
doesn't
get
it
from
consolidated
edison
--
i
mean
his
electricity?
can
he
get
it
from
any
place
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
couldn't
he
be
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
captive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
he
is
free
to
move
out,
move
some
place
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
need
the
captive,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
need
to
argue
the
captive
point,
do
you?
because
it
is
the
captive
that
pays
for
the
mailing
then,
too,
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
volunteers
put
them
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
pays
the
labor
costs?
