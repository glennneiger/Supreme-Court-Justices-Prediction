justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gillespie,
before
you
go
on,
and
perhaps
this
has
already
been
asked,
but
in
your
view
of
the
case
will
all
the
fund
be
distributed
at
the
same
time
or
will
the
46
percent
get
their
share
before
other
people
make
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
other
words
the
46
percent
would
be
paid
before
you
know
for
sure
how
many
of
the
54
percent
would
come
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
will
they
be
paid?
assume
you
are
right
on
fees
and
assume
say
a
certain
percentage
i
take
it
would
be
withheld
out
of
the
46
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
and
assume
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
your
concept
of
the
fee
is
not
a
dollar
figure
but
a
percentage
figure
that
would
be
based
on
what
is
now
available
plus
a
guess
as
to
how
much
more
may
become
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
come
up
with
a
figure
of
a
million
dollars.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
apply
that
across
the
board
of
the
46
percent
and
say
that
amounts
to
25
percent
of
each
person's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
if
more
people
come
in,
they
would
get
more
than
a
million
dollars
in
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
determination
of
a
reasonable
fee
would
really
be
less
than
the
amount
they
would
actually
receive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
essence
the
fee
would
really
be
fixed
as
a
percentage
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
the
sole
criterion
after
the
order
is
entered,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
help
me
with
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
assume
your
view
of
the
case
prevails.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
we
will
reach
a
point
in
time
when
your
fees
will
be
determined,
they
have
not
yet
been
determined.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
the
judge
should
determine
whatever
a
fair
fee
is,
then
how
would
he
pay
it
to
you?
would
he
pay
it
in
the
same
way
that
your
opponent
described,
as
a
percentage
of
the
recovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
claim
that
the
amount
of
your
fee
should
be
entirely
unaffected
by
the
estimate
of
how
much
money
will
actually
be
paid
to
former
debenture
holders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
how
anybody
would
pay
two
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
winer,
let
me
pursue
my
line
with
you
so
you
answer
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing,
based
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
the
district
judge
now
should
conclude
that
a
million
dollars
is
a
fair
fee.
if
i
understand
your
analysis,
that
money
would
be
paid
to
you
forthwith
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
you
would
go
home.
and
whatever
else
money
came
in,
that
would
be
taken
out
of
the
fund
right
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
having
taken
it
out,
would
there
then
be
distribution
to
the
people
who
have
already
filed
their
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
would
bear
the
full
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
everybody's
share
would
be
reduced
by
some
percentage,
roughly
a
sixth
of
the
fund.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
have
all
that
you
would
ever
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
under
his
view
of
the
case,
if
he
made
the
assumption
you
are
entitled
to
a
million
dollars,
as
i
understand
him
you
get
a
million
now
out
of
the
right
percentage;
and
then
you
continue
to
get
more
as
more
people
came
in.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
entirely
possible
that
if
he
wins,
you
get
a
larger
fee
than
if
you
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
tell
you
very
candidly,
i
am
lost
because
i
am
not
sure
you
have
a
final
appealable
judgment
on
the
issue
you
seek
to
argue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
possible
that
you
could
get
a
higher
fee
if
he
wins
than
if
you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
we
are
fighting
about
is
that
one
of
the
factors
that
the
judge
will
take
into
account
when
he
ultimately
reviews
the
12
different
factors
you
have
described
and
finally
fix
a
dollar
amount.
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
common
funds,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
shifting
to
another
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
was
the
counsel
fee
going
to
come
from
in
the
hall
case
and
in
the
mills
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
argument
though
would
you,
about
the
basis
for
reducing
the
amount
that
went
back
to
boeing
by
the
amount
of
the
attorney's
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
boeing
is
benefited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
winer,
their
brief
refers
to
$2
million
claim
for
fees.
is
the
fee
petition
in
the
record;
and
does
the
record
show
the
other
factors
such
as
the
hours
spent
and
so
fourth
in
computing
the
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
claim
for
the
plaintiffs'
fees
amounts
to
$2
million?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
you
are
claiming
$2
million
in
fees
and
expenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
correct
that
the
entire
group
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
there
been
any
evidence
or
any
hearing
at
all
on
the
question
of
what
a
reasonable
fee
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
agree,
mr.
gillespie,
that
if
you
win
you
might
have
to
pay
a
larger
fee
than
if
you
lose?
it
is
entirely
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
this
strictly
an
advisory
opinion,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
is
entirely
possible
that
judge
may
think,
based
on
what
he
knows,
that
the
plaintiffs
ought
to
get
a
million
dollars
in
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
could
do
it
in
one
or
two
ways.
he
could
give
them
a
million
dollars
off
the
top,
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
or
he
could
give
them
a
million
dollars,
thinking
there
are
going
to
be
no
more
claims
filed,
and
say
that
will
come
out
to
20
percent
of
everybody's
recovery
--
i
mean
it
is
20
percent
against
everybody
and
future
20
percents
might
be
paid
to
increase
that
fee.
