justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
--
were
those
the
actual
bases
of
decision
in
either
the
district
court
of
the
second
circuit
or
was
it
a
principle
of
new
york
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
both.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
not
in
any
sense
then
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
a
case
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking
this
is
not
--
was
not
an
opt
in,
opt
out
type
of
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
winer,
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
--
or
at
least
i
think
it
is
the
same
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
your
opponent,
and
that
is,
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
unclaimed
funds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
happens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
am
asking
is
what
your
position
as
a
lawyer
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
to
a
certain
extent
one
can't
decide
the
basis
on
which
attorneys'
fees
are
to
be
recovered
in
a
case
like
this
without
having
some
feel
for
the
disposition
of
the
unclaimed
funds.
it
would
be
one
thing
to
say
that
the
persons
who
claimed
not
only
got
what
they
were
entitled
to
but
a
portion
of
the
unclaimed
funds;
and
quite
another
thing
to
say
it
is
escheated,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
their
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
certain
element
of
windfall.
it
is
either
a
windfall
to
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
or
a
windfall
to
boeing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
you
say,
you
are
here
to
represent
the
plaintiffs,
are
you
not?
and
yet
you
say
one
thing
to
you
is
clear,
and
that
is
that
each
individual
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
any
override.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
kind
of
argument
one
would
normally
expect
from
a
plaintiffs'
attorney
who
was
doing
the
very
best
he
could
to
assure
the
success
of
his
clients,
so
to
speak,
even
though
the
court
might
reject
the
argument,
for
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
to
simply
say,
"well,
certainly
the
plaintiff
isn't
entitled
to
this."
wouldn't
you
at
least
reserve
judgment
on
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
claiming
plaintiffs,
whether
it
is
conceivable
they
might
have
any
entitlement
to
more
than
their
prorated
share
after
a
certain
point
in
time
when
there
is
a
large
part
of
the
funds
still
unclaimed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
alyeska
the
court
dealt
both
with
the
common
fund
and
the
common
benefit
theory,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
had
made
the
same
statement
as
to
both
of
them,
that
they
were
the
english
rule
and
not
the
rule
in
this
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
say
that
you
would
be
better
off
without
the
footnote
which
you
referred
to
in
alyeska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
relying
here
on
any
statutory
provision
for
attorneys'
fees
in
addition
to
the
recovery
of
the
principal,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
you
are
simply
saying
that
you
are
going
to
collect
from
your
client,
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
this
particular
class
action
section
that
we
have
been
discussing
provide
for
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
in
addition
to
the
substantive
recovery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
court
couldn't
award
an
attorneys'
fee
over
and
above
the
actual
substantive
recovery.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
your
typical
case
where
it
says
and
in
addition
to
the
recovery
the
plaintiff
shall
be
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
there
is
escheat
and
the
states
say,
well,
where
is
the
rest
of
my
escheat,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
your
services
in
the
suing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nonetheless
the
amount
of
the
fees
was
not
fixed.
so
something
remained
to
be
done
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
are
lots
of
cases
in
which
--
you
know,
bifurcated
judgments
--
liability
is
determined
but
damages
aren't.
