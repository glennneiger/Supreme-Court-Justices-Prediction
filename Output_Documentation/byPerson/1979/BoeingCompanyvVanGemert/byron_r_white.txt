mr.
gillespie,
at
that
point,
you
just
said
money
that
might
go
back
to
boeing.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
any
unclaimed
portion
does
in
fact
go
back
to
boeing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
would
oppose
any
theory
of
escheat.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
alone
as
to
which
state
it
would
escheat.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
it
does
speak
of
a
judgment,
doesn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wasn't
the
main
question
in
alyeska.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
mills
case
it
a
came
from
the
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
not
a
spreading
of
the
less,
it
was
an
avoidance
of
any
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
claiming
that
the
attorneys'
fees
are
going
to
come
off
the
top
of
the
recoveries?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
talking
about
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
prompts
me
to
ask
about
these
other
cases
that
you
say
were
consolidated
or
brought
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
also
venued
in
the
southern
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
might
claim
escheat,
too,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
happened
to
lose
on
your
escheat
point
and
boeing
got
it
back,
then
a
lot
of
your
argument
is
considerably
damaged,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
boeing
is
entitled
to
these
unclaimed
monies.
i
know
you
say
they
are
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
believe
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
believe
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
getting
money
back
they
never
would
have
gotten
back
before,
although
they
never
would
have
paid
it
out
if
you
hadn't
sued
them.
