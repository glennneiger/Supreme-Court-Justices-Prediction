what
were
the
terms
of
the
escrow
account?
justice
potter
stewart
that
question
is
suggested
by
my
brother
blackmun's
earlier
question
as
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
would
be
ultimate
escheat.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
take
a
position
as
to
which
state
it
would
escheat
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
state
of
washington
would
be
in
here
in
a
hurry.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case,
they
hardly
have
standing
to
be
here,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
insofar
as
part
ii
of
your
brief
that
point
depends
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
boeing
has
no
further
interest
in
these
funds.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
will
escheat
or
something
else
will
happen
to
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
will
never
come
back
to
boeing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
whether
or
not
they
will
escheat
is
a
factor
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
your
whole
part
ii
depends
upon
that,
i
think,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
even
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
here
because
it
wasn't
even
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
final.
