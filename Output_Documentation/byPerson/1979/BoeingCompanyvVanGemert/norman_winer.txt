mr.
norman
winer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
begin
by
saying
to
you
that
mr.
gillespie's
figures
are
somewhat
out
of
date,
not
grossly,
but
as
of
last
wednesday
the
claims
filed
amounted
to
49.25
percent
of
the
original
face
amount
of
the
bonds.
and
may
i
add
one
other
statistic
which
is
in
my
brief,
namely
that
96.4
percent
of
these
bonds
were
redeemed
by
boeing
and
by
the
special
master.
mr.
norman
winer
your
honor,
my
position
must
be
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
the
courts
up
to
now.
there
are
decisions
in
the
third
circuit
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
holding
that
the
depositor
of
the
amount
of
a
judgment
has
no
right
to
reclaim
the
funds.
mr.
norman
winer
what
happens
must
be
escheat.
but
this
has
not
been
decided
here
and
was
not
decided
in
those
two
cases
in
those
words.
mr.
norman
winer
my
belief
is,
sir,
is
that
they
would
escheat,
the
funds
would
escheat.
mr.
norman
winer
right,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
the
recipient
of
the
escheat
would
acquire
the
rights
of
the
parties
whose
money
escheated.
mr.
norman
winer
i
think
perhaps
it
should.
i
think
it
should,
yes,
your
honor,
if
it
should.
but
there
is
no
basis
which
i
can
find
in
law
and
no
case
cited
in
either
of
the
briefs
of
mr.
gillespie
to
the
effect
that
the
money
goes
back
to
boeing.
he
has
made
that
assertion
and
i
don't
know
positively
that
it
will
escheat,
so
i
wish
to
be
cautious.
but
in
my
opinion,
sir,
whether
it
goes
back
to
boeing
or
whether
it
escheats
to
the
state,
the
recipient
of
that
money
should
take
it
subject
to
the
fees.
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir,
that
--
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
right.
that
is
another
question.
i
should
say
to
you
the
state
of
new
york
is
claiming
all
of
it.
they
filed
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
did
not
file
a
brief
here.
mr.
norman
winer
sir?
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir;
no,
sir,
and
that
is
why
i
feel
--
i
don't
know
the
answer.
i
know
that
the
third
circuit
said
it
escheats.
mr.
norman
winer
right,
i
feel
that
is
so,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
sir,
we
do
not
think
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
any
part
of
the
unclaimed
funds.
mr.
norman
winer
i
don't
know
--
mr.
norman
winer
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
standing
to
be
here,
sir,
but
i
think
that
boeing
has
no
standing
here,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
absolutely.
mr.
norman
winer
absolutely.
and
if
--
mr.
norman
winer
that
could
be
a
factor.
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
if
i
may
develop
the
point
a
bit,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
number
one,
the
money
paid
by
boeing
does
not
belong
to
boeing.
therefore
wherever
it
belongs,
the
claimants
should
have
the
same
right
to
pay
only
one
fee
rather
than
two
fees.
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way,
there
is
no
shifting
of
fees
here.
nobody
has
asked
boeing
to
pay
one
cent
more
than
what
it
owes.
a
shifting
of
fees
as
in
england
would
be
if
the
plaintiff
wins
the
fees
of
his
counsel
are
thrust
upon
the
defendant
and
there
is
a
shifting
of
fees.
mr.
norman
winer
it
may
--
if
it
should
ever
be
determined
on
some
basis
which
has
not
been
vouchsafed
that
the
money
goes
back
to
boeing,
then
it
would
surely
be
a
windfall
for
boeing.
why
boeing,
of
all
people,
the
one
that
did
the
wrong?
as
mr.
gillespie
talks,
you
may
think
that
these
innocent
plaintiffs
did
boeing
a
wrong.
but
the
only
wrongs
done
here
were
by
boeing
and
if
the
money
goes
back
to
boeing
it
would
surely
be
a
windfall
of
the
worst
sort.
now,
as
--
sir?
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
according
to
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
point
it
stated
specifically
that
it
would
be
taken
off
the
top
as
in
trustees
v.
greenough.
the
money
would
come
off
the
top
and
the
consequence
of
that
would
be
that
it
would
be
allocated
to
each
and
every
debenture
ratably.
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
and
conversely,
i
feel
that
no
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
pay
two
fees
simply
because
other
people
have
not
filed
claims.
mr.
norman
winer
under
the
american
rule,
sir,
the
victim
of
a
breach
of
contract
must
be
a
loser.
all
he
can
get
in
damages
is
what
the
law
says
a
victim
of
a
breach
of
contract
is
entitled
to
get.
so
that
when
he
pays
one
fee
he
cannot
come
out
whole,
he
comes
out
with
his
righteous
amount
minus
a
fee.
now,
if
he
is
going
to
pay
two
--
what
in
this
case
i
am
calling
the
49.25
percent
a
half
--
so
if
the
people
who
file
half
have
to
pay
the
total
fee,
they
obtain
double
fee.
now,
under
the
decisions
of
both
the
second
circuit
and
--
mr.
norman
winer
may
i
answer
that.
in
the
lindy
case
in
the
third
circuit
and
the
greenough
case
in
the
second
circuit
the
court
specifically
rejected
percentages
of
recovery
for
fees.
they
set
up
12
different
criterion,
the
hours
spent,
the
quality
of
the
work,
the
difficulty
of
the
case,
this,
that
and
the
other;
and
among
other
things
was
the
amount
of
the
recovery.
mr.
norman
winer
right.
mr.
norman
winer
right.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
winer
immediately.
mr.
norman
winer
well,
according
to
my
feeling
they
would
bear
one-half
the
amount
and
the
other
half
would
be
taken
out
of
the
funds
which
are
not
claimed.
mr.
norman
winer
absolutely
--
everybody
--
plaintiffs
would
pay
their
fees
and
--
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
all
we
would
ever
get.
mr.
norman
winer
well,
sir,
it
is
possible.
but
really,
sir,
i
think
the
people
who
are
getting
lost
here
are
the
plaintiffs.
i
really
don't
care
--
mr.
norman
winer
well,
i
understand
that
point
and
i
must
say
that
whether
i
didn't
go
into
the
appealability
of
it
but
i
certainly
argued
that
it
was
premature
and
i
certainly
do
think
it
is
premature.
but
it
is
here
and
apparently
nobody
--
mr.
norman
winer
sir?
mr.
norman
winer
right.
mr.
norman
winer
i
argued
there
that
it
was
premature
but
i
did
not
succeed.
and
i
am
not
sure
--
i
am
not
saying
that
as
from
a
point
of
view
of
appealability
it
is
not
final
because
this
is
a
matter
for
argument.
but
i
am
saying
that
i
think
they
should
have
waited
until
the
fee
was
fixed
and
then
brought
the
whole
thing
here
at
once,
because
this
case
is
only
13-1/2
years
old,
and
now
when
we
go
back
and
the
fees
are
fixed
i
don't
know
whether
i
will
out
live
it.
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir,
it
is
possible.
mr.
norman
winer
well,
i
haven't
thought
of
it
that
way
but
i
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
correct.
nobody
is
entitled
to
more
than
the
amount
of
his
judgment;
and
he
has
got
to
pay
out
of
his
judgment
a
counsel
fee,
so
he
is
going
to
come
out
with
less.
mr.
norman
winer
i
am
afraid,
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
are
you
talking
about
the
non-claiming
plaintiffs?
mr.
norman
winer
well,
sir,
the
case
was
decided
in
eisen
v.
carlisle
&
jacquelin
that
there
should
be
no
fluid
recovery,
under
no
circumstances
could
a
plaintiff
get
more
than
his
personal
damages;
and
so
i
have
taken
that
to
be
law.
this
court
remanded
on
entirely
different
ground
but
it
seemed
to
me
approved
that
holding
of
the
second
circuit,
that
there
should
be
no
fluid
recovery.
now,
if
i
may
continue
then
with
what
i
said
about
the
distribution.
professor
dawson
of
the
harvard
law
school
in
the
harvard
law
review
has
written
three
articles
covering
this
subject
very
fully.
and
he
takes
the
view,
or
i
will
quote
his
words,
to
the
effect
that
the
question
here
is
distributing
the
loss,
distributing
the
loss
which
accrues
to
these
plaintiffs
by
having
to
pay
a
fee
to
get
back
their
money.
and
i
think
when
it
is
presented
in
that
way
it
is
a
very
clear
and
correct
analysis.
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
take
the
loss
of
paying
a
counsel
fee
for
getting
back
what
was
due
to
these
people
13
years
ago.
again,
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
mr.
gillespie
in
going
over
quickly
the
question
of
benefit
and
unjust
enrichment
and
so
on
has
not
quoted
accurately
or
fully,
i
should
say,
the
statement
of
this
court
in
trustees
v.
greenough
which
was
when
the
acting
plaintiff
recovered
the
judgment
for
the
benefit
of
the
class
of
bondholders,
he
said
two
things.
he
said
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
plaintiff
if
he
were
not
reimbursed
as
well
as
enriching
the
other
members
of
the
class
unjustly.
now,
mr.
gillespie
has
some
justification
for
pounding
only
the
second
part
of
that
sentence,
because
the
courts
have
frequently
done
that.
but
the
true
fact
is
that
what
greenough
did
was
to
follow
the
old
english
cases.
a
creditor
came
in
with
a
creditor's
bill
to
save
certain
property
for
the
benefit
of
all
creditors.
somebody
who
was
interested
in
a
charitable
trust
brought
an
action
to
save
a
charitable
trust.
or
a
creditor
brought
an
adverse
petition
in
bankruptcy.
now,
in
all
of
those
cases
in
england
200
years
ago,
and
in
this
country
ever
since,
anybody
who
produced
a
fund
for
the
benefit
of
a
number
of
people
received
reimbursement
from
that
fund
for
all
of
the
expense
of
the
litigation
and
the
net
proceeds
of
the
recovery
were
distributed
among
the
class.
now
this,
as
judge
kaufman
said,
is
the
unbroken
line
of
precedents
in
this
country.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
alyeska.
alyeska
involved
a
case
--
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
no
fund,
there
was
no
fund
there,
there
was
a
public
interest.
and
the
doctrine
of
a
private
attorney
general
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
circuit
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
a
different
question
than
the
production
of
a
fund
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
rule
which
has
persisted
in
this
court
since
greenough,
which
was
1881
--
getting
close
to
a
hundred
years
--
is
still
the
rule
in
this
court.
now,
--
mr.
norman
winer
it
distinguished
the
two,
right.
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir,
i
believe
that
the
court
was
very
careful
and
that
the
statements
in
the
footnotes
where
these
statements
occur,
where
the
only
place
common
fund
and
common
benefit
are
put
in
the
same
sentence,
is
very
careful
to
distinguish
the
two.
now,
the
court
did
not
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
common
benefit.
in
taking
up
for
example
the
case
of
mills
v.
electric
auto-lite,
the
court
did
find
that
there
was
a
shared
benefit
and
that
--
you
recall
that
in
that
case
stockholders
brought
suit
to
enjoin
a
proposed
merger
between
a
company
which
owned
54
percent
of
the
stock
and
of
the
merges
and
that
company.
now,
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
although
there
was
no
specific
fund
the
benefit
was
for
the
benefit
of
all
--
was
granted
to
all
stockholders
because
they
saved
this
corporation
from
a
bad
merger.
now,
that
i
believe
is
the
first
real
common
benefit
case
decided
by
this
court.
and
then
it
went
on
to
the
hall
v.
cole
case
where
it
was
decided
that
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
members
of
the
union
that
the
protagonists
had
provided
freedom
of
speech
for
all
members
of
the
union.
now,
those
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
are
the
only
two
common
benefit
cases
decided
here.
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir;
no,
sir,
i
should
not.
i
should
say
that
the
footnote
in
alyeska
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
longstanding
rule
of
this
court.
i
don't
know
anything
--
mr.
norman
winer
on
common
funds,
right.
and
i
think
it
was
--
well,
the
rest
--
mr.
norman
winer
not
at
all.
in
alyeska,
alyeska
was
asked
to
pay
the
counsel
fee
of
the
wilderness
society
which
had
presumably
protected
the
beauty
of
alaska
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
american
public.
mr.
norman
winer
the
counsel
fee
in
hall
v.
cole
came
out
of
the
union
treasury.
mr.
norman
winer
from
the
corporation.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
right.
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
everybody
concerned,
plaintiffs
and
defendants;
they
shared.
just
as
i
say
to
you
that
this
fee
should
be
shared
by
all
those
who
have
a
judgment.
now,
anyone
of
these
people
may
come
in.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
what
will
happen
in
the
future,
we
don't
know.
but
we
do
know
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
its
opinion
only
20
percent
had
filed
claims.
and
as
of
last
wednesday,
49.5
percent
had
filed.
now,
i
should
like
--
and
trust
that
i
am
not
rude
in
saying
that
as
far
as
letters,
whether
they
are
hypothetical
or
real,
i
have
never
heard.
and
mr.
gillespie
later
said
that
this
is
not
in
the
record,
that
$128,000,
they
rejected
their
claims.
but
i
do
feel
from
my
experience
with
this
case
and
with
boeing
that
i
should
be
very
careful
whether
those
letters
were
written
by
boeing
employees
or
people
who
are
beholden
to
boeing.
anybody
can
write
a
letter
and
say,
i
reject
it.
and
maybe
for
very
good
cause.
mr.
norman
winer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
winer
not
according
to
my
theory,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honor
that
i
doubt
that
anybody
has
benefited
more
than
boeing.
boeing
has
held
--
in
the
first
place,
boeing
is
the
one
that
moved
to
consolidate
these
actions,
who
made
it
into
a
class
action.
when
i
first
heard
of
this
case
is
when
the
motion
had
already
been
made
by
boeing
under
rule
23(b)(1)
to
consolidate
into
new
york,
the
southern
district
of
new
york
four
cases
which
were
brought
by
individuals.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
amounts
of
money
are
too
small
to
fight
about.
these
four
of
the
ten
cases
which
had
been
brought
and
consolidated
were
brought
by
individuals.
we
represent
people
with
$50,000
worth
of
bonds
individually
who
are
entitled
to
$175,000.
and
i
myself
have
a
client
with
$20,000
worth
of
bonds,
an
old
client
of
mine;
and
we
have
60,000-odd.
i
would
not
wait
looking
for
a
class
action,
i
wouldn't
have
brought
a
class
action.
but
the
thing
was
already
made
a
class
action
by
boeing.
mr.
norman
winer
in
addition
to?
mr.
norman
winer
oh,
no;
no,
no.
i
say
that
our
clients
are
the
class
--
made
the
class
by
mr.
gillespie's
motion.
we
represent
the
class
under
23
and
i
think
your
honor
is
the
one
who
pointed
out
before
that
there
is
no
way
to
opt
out.
and
mr.
gillespie
created
that
situation
for
the
benefit
of
boeing
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
defend
all
these
cases
around
the
country.
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir;
no,
sir.
the
only
provision
in
rule
23,
it
occurs
in
rule
23(d)
where
it
is
provided
that
the
court
may
make
such
orders
as
are
--
as
in
its
discretion
seem
to
be
proper
in
the
case.
mr.
norman
winer
i
can't
believe
that,
i
can't
imagine
that
it
could.
i
know
no
basis,
none
has
ever
been
suggested
to
my
knowledge,
that
the
court
could
award
a
fee
above
it.
i
don't
know
--
oh,
you
mean
out
of
--
mr.
norman
winer
no,
sir.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
at
least
as
far
as
new
york
law
is
concerned,
that
could
happen
only
if
a
statute
provided
--
so
provided.
and
there
is
no
such
statute
here.
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
my
answer
is
the
benefit
received
by
the
state
of
new
york
was
due
to
the
work
of
the
attorneys
and
is
subject
to
the
counsel
fee
earned
by
the
attorneys.
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
i
don't
know
if
it
should
escheat
somewhere
else
--
mr.
norman
winer
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
winer
originally?
mr.
norman
winer
i
don't
believe
any
of
them
was.
one
came
from
michigan,
one
came
from
florida,
two
came
from
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
norman
winer
you
are
right,
they
might
claim
escheat.
but
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
whether
it
escheats,
wherever
it
escheats
the
benefit
of
the
escheat
should
pay
a
sum
which
any
plaintiff
would
pay,
whether
that
plaintiff
is
one
who
claimed
or
whether
that
plaintiff
is
one
of
those
who
did
not
claim,
and
by
virtue
of
his
non-claiming
--
mr.
norman
winer
you
mean
if
the
state
is
entitled
to
--
mr.
norman
winer
may
i
answer
that
briefly.
i
believe
not.
mr.
norman
winer
because
--
mr.
norman
winer
i
believe
that
the
money
would
not
--
i
believe
that
there
would
be
no
difference
whether
it
went
to
boeing
or
escheat.
and
the
reason
i
believe
that
there
is
no
difference
is
that
boeing
would
not
be
receiving
that
money
back
as
defendant
in
its
role
as
defendant.
mr.
norman
winer
it
would
be
receiving
it
back
because
of
a
lack
of
some
--
sort
of
a
si
prius
doctrine,
we
can't
give
it
to
whom
it
belongs
and
therefore
the
next
best
class
is
boeing.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
is
ever
going
to
be
decided.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
bottom
would
fall
out
of
it
went
back
to
boeing,
i
should
say
no.
mr.
norman
winer
i
would
be
making
my
same
argument,
namely
--
mr.
norman
winer
boeing
would
benefit,
certainly.
mr.
norman
winer
right.
now,
may
i
just
say
--
mr.
norman
winer
well,
now
here
we
have,
your
honor,
boeing
taking
the
side
of
the
non-claimant.
now,
has
mr.
gillespie
any
standing
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
don't
take
the
money
away
from
those
non-claimants,
when
he
knows
that
he
wants
those
non-claimants
not
to
get
the
money?
mr.
norman
winer
the
record
has
a
complete
listing
of
hours,
nature
of
services,
and
all
that,
only
up
to
the
point
of
the
third
appeal.
mr.
norman
winer
i
am
sorry.
mr.
norman
winer
i
am
not
claiming
even
$1
million.
mr.
norman
winer
there
are
some
lawyers
in
chicago
who
have
had
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
and
i
think
they
are
claiming
a
million
dollars.
if
you
put
together
all
the
claims
in
this
case
by
people
who
had
a
remote
relation
to
it,
it
does.
i
presume
mr.
gillespie
is
right.
i
didn't
add
it
up.
mr.
norman
winer
there
have
been
only
very
lengthy
affidavits,
very
lengthy;
but
no
hearing.
i
thank
you.
