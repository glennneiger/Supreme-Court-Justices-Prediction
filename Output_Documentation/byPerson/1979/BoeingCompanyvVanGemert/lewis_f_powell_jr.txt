justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
presents
a
problem
as
to
the
source
of
attorney's
fees
in
a
rather
complicated
class
action
case.
as
the
facts
may
be
unique
and
of
little
general
interest,
i
will
say
only
a
word
about
the
holding,
the
district
court
awarded
the
class
a
lump-sum
judgment
against
boeing.
the
court
then
ordered
that
every
member
must
bear
his
proportionate
part
of
attorney's
fees
ultimately
to
be
awarded.
each
member
of
the
class
has
an
undisputed
and
mathematically
ascertainable
claim
to
a
part
of
the
lump-sum
award,
whether
exercised
or
not,
each
class
member
is
legally
benefited
by
this
right.
we
therefore
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
each
class
member
must
bear
as
a
charge
against
the
fund,
his
proportionate
share
of
such
attorney's
fees
as
ultimately
is
awarded.
this
is
an
application
of
the
common-fund
doctrine
and
therefore,
it
is
consistent
with
the
american
rule
against
the
taxing
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
losing
party.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
