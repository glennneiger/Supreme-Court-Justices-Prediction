mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
petition
of
the
boeing
company.
this
case
is
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
a
6-3
en
banc
decision
of
that
court
dealing
with
what
it
said
it
regarded
as
having
unusual
significance
for
the
conduct
of
class
action
litigation.
specifically,
whether
attorneys
for
plaintiffs
who
successfully
prosecute
a
federal
class
action
for
money
damages
are
entitled
to
look
for
their
compensation
to
the
total
amount
for
which
a
defendant
would
be
liable
if
all
class
members
perfected
their
claims
by
filing
proofs
of
claims
or
only
from
the
amounts
payable
to
those
class
members
who
do
file
proofs
of
claim
and
thus
receive
the
benefits
of
the
legal
services
rendered
by
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
under
review
held
that
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
were
entitled
to
be
paid
not
only
from
money
actually
claimed
by
their
client
class
members
but
also
from
unclaimed
money
which
that
court
in
an
earlier
decision
in
this
very
case
held
will
never
belong
to
or
become
the
property
of
any
client
of
these
attorneys.
now,
it
is
the
position
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
almost
that
situation
right
here.
the
brief
that
is
amicus
curiaed
that
has
been
filed
by
the
special
master
appointed
to
administer
this
fund
informs
the
court
that
claimant,
or
rather
holders
of
128,000
face
amount
of
these
debentures
have
been
identified,
they
have
been
in
touch
with
and
they
have
declined
to
file
proofs
of
claim.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
no,
they
have
not,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
question
of
their
not
being
reached
and
told
that
they
could
do
this.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
i
think
that
is
an
an
a
fortiori
case
under
those
circumstances,
if
he
renounces
there
is
no
reason
why
his
share
of
that
recovery
should
be
utilized
to
pay
the
attorneys
for
the
class
members
who
have
claims,
under
this
court's
decision.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
quite
right,
mr.
chief
justice;
quite
right.
now,
it
is
our
position,
or
the
position
of
the
boeing
company
on
this
appeal,
and
it
was
the
position
of
a
panel
of
the
second
circuit
which
decided
this
case
prior
to
the
en
banc
decision,
that
to
allow
plaintiffs'
attorneys
to
be
compensated
for
monies
that
are
not
claimed
is
two
fundamental
errors.
one,
that
it
is
requiring
claiming
class
members,
or
it
is
entitling
claiming
class
members
to
benefit
from
monies
to
which
they
are
not
entitled.
and
second,
that
it
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
this
court's
holding
in
the
alyeska
pipeline
company
case
because
the
funds
which
are
not
claimed
would
revert
to
the
defendant
in
the
case
and
therefore
if
they
had
skimmed
off
of
them
sums
to
pay
the
claimants'
attorneys,
there
would
be
a
case
of
the
defendants
paying
part
of
the
legal
expenses
of
the
plaintiffs
in
violation
of
this
court's
rule
in
alyeska
that
each
party
should
pay
its
own
attorneys'
fees.
now,
before
proceeding
to
spell
out
the
detail
of
that
argument
i
would
just
take
a
minute
to
describe
the
background
of
the
action
against
which
this
question
comes
to
your
honors.
this
action
is
the
consolidation
of
ten
suits
which
were
commenced
in
1966
after
boeing,
as
part
of
its
program
to
finance
the
construction
of
the
747
boeing
aircraft,
called
for
redemption
a
$30
million
convertible
debenture
issue
which
it
had
sold
in
1958.
under
the
terms
of
the
indenture
pursuant
to
which
these
securities
were
issued,
the
holders
had
a
specified
period
after
a
call
for
redemption
within
which
to
convert
their
debentures
to
common
stock.
otherwise,
the
holder
would
be
limited
in
the
future
to
receiving
only
the
face
amount
of
his
debenture
and
not
any
accrual
that
might
have
occurred
in
the
value
of
the
common
stock
at
the
time
of
the
call.
in
this
instance
on
the
day
when
the
right
to
convert
expired,
march
29,
1966,
boeing
common
stock
was
selling
for
a
price
at
which
$100
of
principal
amount
of
debentures
if
converted
would
have
been
worth
$316.25,
or
$216.25
more
than
its
face
amount.
these
convertible
debentures
were
unregistered
bearer
debentures
and
after
the
call
for
redemption
and
after
the
time
to
convert
having
expired,
1,544,300
face
amount
of
the
30
million
had
not
been
converted.
boeing,
faced
with
this
problem
of
what
it
should
do
about
those
who
had
failed
to
claim,
sought
the
advice
of
two
law
firms,
whether
in
fairness
to
non-converting
holders
and
also
in
fairness
to
its
own
shareholders,
many
of
which
had
become
shareholders
by
reason
of
converting
in
time,
sought
the
advice
of
two
law
firms
as
to
what
it
should
do
under
these
circumstances.
i
emphasize
this
because
this
is
no
case
of
fraud
or
impropriety
on
behalf
of
anyone.
they
were
in
a
dilemma
under
the
circumstances.
the
two
firms
advised
them
that
they
could
not
extend
the
time
without
violating
the
provisions
of
the
indenture
under
which
these
securities
had
been
issued.
and
under
those
circumstances
boeing
followed
the
advice
and
very
shortly
along
came
these
ten
lawsuits.
they
were
consolidated
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
the
boeing
company
moved
for
class
action
treatment
under
rule
23,
which
the
court
granted.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
the
basis
of
jurisdiction,
there
were
claims
made
under
the
trust
indenture
act
and
under
the
securities
act
of
1934.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
are
you
referring
to
the
compensation
decision
or
the
original
decision
under
which
the
district
court
dismissed
this
action
on
the
ground
that
the
indenture
had
been
fully
complied
with;
are
you
referring
to
that
decision,
your
honor,
or
are
you
referring
to
the
compensation
decision
which
is
here
before
the
court?
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
i
think
on
the
first
decision,
on
the
merits
it
is
very
clear
that
they
went
on
the
trust
indenture
act
and
the
federal
securities
act.
on
the
compensation
question
which
is
here,
i
think
they
went
as
a
matter
of
general
federal
law.
they
did
not
utilize
new
york
law,
although
new
york
law
in
every
respect
as
we
see
it
is
the
same
as
federal
law
with
regard
to
this
question.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
it
was
not,
your
honor.
now,
the
district
court
after
trial
dismissed
the
complaint
here,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
holding
that
the
indenture
had
been
complied
with
and
that
there
was
no
basis
for
these
debenture
holders
recovering.
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
agreed
that
the
indenture
had
been
complied
with
but
concluded
that
the
indenture
provisions
with
regard
to
notice
to
these
debenture
holders
did
not
provide,
as
they
said,
"reasonable
notice."
and
said
that
these
debenture
holders
were
entitled
to
recover
the
difference
between
the
$100
and
the
$316.25.
they
then
sent
the
case
back.
that
first
appeal
was
known
as
van
gemert
one.
they
sent
the
case
back,
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
for
$3,283,359,
which
was
taking
the
face
amount
of
the
debentures,
$1,544,000,
and
multiplying
it
by
the
$216
as
to
which
each
of
these
people
were
entitled,
and
said
they
were
entitled
to
receive
that
amount
of
money
if
claimed.
and
that
judgment
provided
specifically
that
each
member
of
the
class
who
had
not
redeemed
his
debenture,
upon
surrendering
it
would
get
$316
per
debenture
less
his
share
of
the
attorneys'
fees
required
to
collect
this
judgment.
now,
if
that
judgment
had
stayed
the
way
it
was
we
never
would
be
here
today.
we
were
satisfied
with
it
as
a
procedural
matter
and
ready
to
proceed.
however,
the
plaintiffs
appealed
a
second
time.
they
were
not
happy.
and
they
raised
a
very
important,
significant
point
that
is
involved
in
this
appeal
here
at
the
present
time.
they
argued
in
the
second
circuit
that
the
people
who
claimed
were
entitled
not
only
to
their
own
$216
over
the
$100
face
amount
but
also
to
any
amount
that
was
not
their
share
of
any
amount
that
was
not
claimed
by
one
of
their
fellow
class
members,
called
a
fluid
class
recovery.
and
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
you
are
quite
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
this
was
23
--
i
think
it
is
1
or
2
--
there
was
no
right
to
opt
out.
that
is
quite
right.
so
they
made
that
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
that
they
were
entitled
to
get
not
only
that
$2.16
but
whatever
--
on
top
of
that
whatever
anybody
else
their
share
did
not
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
struck
that
down.
they
further
struck
down
a
second
request
which
was
that
even
if
we
can't
get
something
for
our
pockets
with
regard
to
this,
we
at
least
ought
to
get
the
attorney's
fees
paid
from
that
unclaimed
portion
as
well.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
three-judge
panel
held,
no,
you
are
not
entitled
to
that
because
that
itself
would
be
an
infringement
on
our
rejection
in
the
eisen
case
of
the
fluid
recovery
doctrine.
furthermore,
said
the
court,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
american
rule
on
attorneys'
fees
as
propounded
in
the
alyeska
case
because
we
would
be
taking
money
from
--
that
might
go
back
to
boeing
and
using
it
to
pay
--
help
pay
the
class
members
who
do
claim
their
attorneys'
fees.
so
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
yes.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
it
certainly
is,
your
honor,
but
that
has
not
been
decided
as
yet.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
we
certainly
would,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
that
would
certainly
be
a
tremendous
problem,
but
we
would
oppose
that
vigorously,
your
honor.
now,
when
this
decision
was
rendered
by
the
second
circuit,
my
brethren
here,
did
they
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
of
that?
no.
did
they
petition
for
review
in
this
court?
that
was
the
decision.
it
went
back
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
lo
and
behold,
the
judgment
--
this
was
van
gemert
two
is
now
out
of
the
way
--
the
judgment
which
was
proposed
to
the
court
followed
the
same
procedure
as
previously
with
regard
to
the
$3,280,000
which
it
claimed
these
debenture
holders
would
get.
but
then
it
went
on
and
said
this
and
it
is
further
ordered
that
the
members
of
the
plaintiffs'
committee
of
attorneys
be
awarded
their
fees
and
expenses
and
disbursements
as
fixed
by
the
court
to
be
paid
out
of
said
total
amount
of
this
judgment.
now,
we
regarded
this
to
be
in
direct
violation
of
what
the
second
circuit
had
done
in
van
gemert
two
and,
moreover,
we
were
astounded
because
at
that
time
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
were
asking
for
$2
million
in
counsel
fees
in
this
action.
so
for
the
first
time
the
boeing
company
took
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit.
and
when
we
went
up
there
and
argued
in
that
deal
before
the
panel,
the
panel
of
three
judges
agreed
with
us
and
said
under
our
prior
decision
we
said
there
cannot
be
any
respect
for
the
--
or
acquiescence
in
a
fluid
class
recovery
and
to
allow
the
class
members
to
get
something
from
the
non-claimers
would
be
a
violation
of
that.
and
furthermore
it
would
be
a
violation
of
alyeska.
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
for
the
first
time
and
we
get
the
decision
6
to
3,
which
is
under
review
here.
now,
before
i
proceed
to
give
you
very
quickly
the
three
reasons
we
think
that
decision
en
banc
is
wrong,
i
want
to
just
report
very
briefly
the
status
of
the
distribution
of
this
fund
at
the
present
time.
on
july
8,
1977,
just
a
few
days
following
the
decision
of
van
gemert
two,
boeing
deposited
in
an
escrow
account
--
not
a
judgment
but
an
escrow
account
--
as
established
by
the
district
court's
judgment
the
$3,289,359
which
i
have
been
referring
to
and
$2,459,646
of
pre-judgment
interest,
which
combined
sum
together
with
other
deposits
currently
accruing
interest
is
today
over
$7
million.
as
a
result
of
published
notices
and
two
years
of
beating
the
drums
and
the
work
of
this
sole
special
master
mr.
solleder,
46
percent
of
the
fact
amount
of
the
debentures
unconverted
on
march
29,
'66
have
filed
claims.
to
date
the
remaining
54
percent
of
potential
claimants
have
either
not
been
identified
or
having
been
located,
mr.
chief
justice,
have
to
date
declined
to
perfect
their
judgments.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
by
amount,
your
honor.
forty-six
percent
of
the
face
amount
of
the
debentures
which
were
not
converted
and
54
percent
which
were
not
converted
have
not
claimed,
54
percent.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
it
is
just
--
well,
i
will
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
right.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
--
just
one
moment
--
the
paragraph,
mr.
justice
stewart,
of
the
judgment
reads,
ordered
that
within
15
days
after
the
entry
of
this
judgment
the
defendant
shall
deposit
the
amount
of
this
judgment,
plus
interest
at
the
rate
of
6
percent
per
annum
to
the
date
of
such
deposit
in
a
commercial
bank,
and
so
forth,
upon
which
interest
shall
accumulate
until
disbursed.
and
that
such
money
shall
be
so
held
in
escrow
pending
the
further
order
of
this
court.
then
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
order,
the
special
master
is
given
instructions
that
he
shall
pass
on
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
claims.
now,
we
say
that
that
therefore
leaves
the
unclaimed
funds
up
to
further
order
of
the
court
at
a
later
time.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
it
does,
your
honor;
it
does
speak
of
a
judgment.
but
after
all,
that
is
the
judgment
of
liability
which,
as
i
understand
it,
in
class
actions
is
preliminary
to
whatever
may
be
done
by
individual
class
members.
now,
without
repeating
here
the
arguments
and
the
analysis
of
authorities
--
by
the
way,
i
would
just
say
that
you
can
see
that
46
and
54
percent
of
$7
million,
that
the
funds
that
are
being
dealt
with
here
are
not
de
minimis.
without
repeating
our
arguments
on
the
brief,
there
are
three
principal
reasons
that
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
was
in
error.
the
most
egregious
error
we
believe
is
in
the
underlying
premise
which
the
majority
advances
to
support
its
stated
desire
to
avoid,
and
i
quote,
"unfairness
to
claiming
class
members"
and
to
permit
them
to
enjoy,
and
i
quote,
"the
spoils
of
victory."
now,
the
court,
which
is
its
right
to
recognize
those
elements,
by
saying
that
its
decision
is
sustained
by
longstanding
precedent.
now,
the
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
are
trustees
v.
greenough
and
sprague
v.
ticonic
national
bank.
i
am
sure
mr.
justice
white
is
familiar
with
these,
because
they
are
dealt
with
in
the
alyeska
case
and
the
very
question
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
dealt
with
in
that
opinion.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
no,
no.
but
the
contentions
were
made
--
and
i
have
the
briefs
here,
your
honor
--
that
those
cases
warranted
the
court
reaching
a
decision
of
imposing
on
the
losing
party
the
counsel
fees.
and
the
court
rejected
it
and
explained
the
corollary
to
the
american
rule
of
attorneys'
fees,
that
those
cases
embody
and
limited
it.
that
corollary
is
to
the
effect
that
where
a
prevailing
litigant
has
conferred
benefits
on
other
parties
that
can
be
identified,
that
those
parties
before
participating
in
the
benefits
of
the
litigation
must
share
their
part
of
the
cost
of
the
litigation.
this
corollary
to
the
american
rule
on
lawyers'
fees
is
founded
on
the
common
law
principle
against
unjust
enrichment.
in
other
words,
if
somebody
--
and
it
is
on
this
very
basis
that
the
claimants
who
come
into
this
case
and
collect
--
the
46
percent
who
collect
--
must
obviously
pay
their
share
of
the
attorneys'
fees,
and
with
that
we
have
no
question.
but
that
is
the
principle
of
those
two
cases
that
i
just
mentioned,
sprague
and
the
trustees
v.
greenough.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
first
place
we
have
had
two
years
when
the
effort
to
locate
these
potential
claimants
has
gone
forward,
claims
have
been
filed,
they
have
been
reviewed.
and
as
the
special
master
reports
in
his
little
amicus
brief,
i
think
of
the
claims
that
have
been
filed,
i
am
not
sure
of
this,
but
there
is
about
30,000
which
is
still
under
review.
now,
as
soon
as
this
question
has
been
decided
those
will
be
paid
off
at
once.
and
then
the
district
court
has
stated
it
will
consider
again
how
much
longer
it
will
extend
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
no,
i
think
what
would
be
done
is
that
the
court
would
determine
what
was
a
fair
attorneys'
fees
in
this
situation.
it
would
then
assess
against
the
claiming
class
holders
who
came
in
who
are
now
there
with
their
46
percent
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
--
and
assess
that
against
them.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
if
thereafter
someone
else
comes
in
and
makes
a
claim,
the
same
percentage
as
applied
to
each
of
the
claiming
ones
previously
would
apply
to
the
new
claimant.
and
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
would
receive
that
percentage
at
that
time.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
quite
right,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
will
do,
it
will
take
that
46
percent
and
then
they
will
say,
what
is
it
that
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
are
entitled
to
here
based
on
their
services,
the
difficulty
of
the
case,
etc.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
then
that
is
applied
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
correct.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
yes,
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
take
that
into
consideration
or
not.
but
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
when
it
sent
this
back
in
van
gemert
two
envisaged
this
being
carried
out
was
that
just
as
i
have
explained
to
your
honor
at
this
time.
and
if
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
thereafter,
if
other
people
came
in
and
got
the
benefits
of
it,
then
they
would
owe
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
a
fee.
and
that
fee
would
be
measured
as
it
had
been
measured
in
the
case
of
those
who
had
previously
claimed.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
i
think
as
in
all
of
this
kind
of
case
that
the
percentage
would
certainly
be
a
very
important
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
unless
as
your
honor
suggested,
i
think
--
it
is
hard
to
say
how
the
district
court
will
actually
do
this
determination.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
will
certainly
give
great
weight
to
the
services
rendered
and
then
i
think
they
will
give
weight
to
the
result
achieved
and
thereby
bring
into
effect
a
percentage
which
of
course
would
be
the
same
percentage
that
was
ultimately
applied
the
other
claims.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
your
honor,
i
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
regard
to
this,
i
would
say
first.
but
from
my
considerable
experience
in
this
type
of
case
where
claims
are
not
filed,
very
often
a
potential
claimant
has
completed
a
tax
year
and
does
not
want
to
go
back
and
reopen
by
reason
of
additional
income
the
entire
tax
picture,
or
has
made
some
other
arrangement.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
i
would
think
they
were
fairly
modest
amounts,
your
honor.
but
it
is
$128,000
face
amount
of
the
$1,544,000.
well,
now,
i
see
just
five
minutes
and
i
quickly
say
there
are
three
specific
grounds
which
we
urge
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
i
would
like
to
reserve
two
minutes,
so
i
will
get
this
off
my
chest
in
three
minutes
if
i
may,
your
honor.
it
is
just
so
if
any
questions
come
up
i
could
be
able
to
answer
them
after
the
respondents
have
completed.
first,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
violates
the
common
fund
principle
of
trustees
v.
greenough,
as
applied
in
alyeska,
in
the
opinion
in
alyeska.
second,
we
believe
that
no
judgment
as
far
as
an
individual
is
concerned
comes
into
being
until
a
claim
is
filed,
so
that
there
is
no
common
fund
within
the
principle
of
those
cases
until
a
claim
is
filed.
and
last,
and
most
important,
we
believe
that
any
decision
which
encompasses
using
some
of
the
unclaimed
fund
to
benefit
the
claiming
members
is
a
clear
violation
of
what
is
called
the
fluid
class
recovery,
the
rule
that
if
it
is
a
small
amount
perhaps,
it
may
be
fairly
large,
but
it
is
allowing
the
claiming
members,
in
effect,
to
benefit
from
those
who
do
not
claim
from
that
fund.
and
that
has
been
not
only
in
the
eisen
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
that
ruled
out,
but
in
this
very
case
it
was
ruled
out.
and
for
these
reasons,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
second
circuit.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
your
honor,
i
just
have
one
item
that
i
would
like
to
bring
up.
by
the
way,
the
district
court
specifically
reserved
decision
on
the
matter
of
counsel
fees
until
this
question
was
determined
by
the
appellate
courts
and
filed
an
opinion
which
is
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
it
is
entirely
possible
if
the
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
no,
no.
excuse
me,
your
honor,
then
i
haven't
understood
you.
if
we
prevail
here,
then
no
part
of
the
attorneys'
fees
will
be
assessed
against
the
non-claimant
fund.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
right.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
conceivably
from
each
additional
claimant.
and
that
is
why
--
the
one
point
i
wanted
to
respond
in
this
reply
is
to
mr.
justice
potter's
question
about
the
finality
of
this
judgment.
the
judgment
which
is
appealed
from
here
first
says
that
the
plaintiff
shall
recover
their
damages
herein
from
the
defendants
the
principal
sum
of
$3,289,359.
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
ordered
that
the
members
of
the
plaintiffs'
committee
be
awarded
their
fees,
expenses
and
disbursements
fixed
by
the
court
to
be
paid
out
of
said
total
amount
of
this
judgment.
now,
we
were
faced
when
we
saw
that
judgment
with
the
fact
that
unless
we
raised
that
point
now
this
would
be
final.
and
when
the
time
came
in
as
to
where
those
monies
should
come
from
it
would
be
saying,
well,
you
never
appealed
from
this
judgment.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
but
still
the
determination
of
where
those
fees
won
liability
and
where
those
fees
should
come
from
was
imposed
on
the
total
fund
which
we
claim,
and
still
claim,
if
unclaimed
belongs
to
boeing.
and
as
to
that
extent
it
is
final
on
that
issue.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie
well,
justice
rehnquist,
with
due
respect
on
this
issue
the
point
--
the
clear
point
that
re
loomis,
as
of
this
case
have
to
pay
part
of
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys'
fees,
whatever
they
may
be
fixed
at,
in
due
respect
we
believe
was
final.
and
if
we
didn't
raise
it
and
bring
it
up
we
would
then
be
told
we
were
bound
by
that
determination.
right
or
wrong,
that
was
our
position.
and
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
en
banc,
but
earlier;
and
the
court
took
the
position
and
decided
a
res,
the
panel.
thank
you
very
much.
