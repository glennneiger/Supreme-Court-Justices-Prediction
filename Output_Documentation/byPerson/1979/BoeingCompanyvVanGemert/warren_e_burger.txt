mr.
gillespie,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
think
of
the
hypothetical
situation
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
class
wrote
in
to
the
court
and
said,
i
think
the
court
has
been
wrong
in
the
decision,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
money
due
me
from
boeing
company,
and
therefore
i
refuse
to
accept
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
haven't
affirmatively
renounced,
however,
have
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
hypothetical
is
a
person
who
affirmatively
renounces
on
the
grounds
that
he
thinks
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
there
is
no
difference
then
between
an
affirmative
renunciation
and
a
passive,
neglectful
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
get
that
clear.
is
it
46
percent
by
number
or
46
percent
by
amount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
respect
to
this
$128,000
you
more
or
less
have
seemingly
at
least
waived
their
claims.
can
you
tell
us
from
this
record
if
we
can
find
out
if
those
are
small
claims
where
people
just
didn't
want
to
take
the
trouble,
or
what
is
the
explanation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
would
infer
from
that
then
that
they
were
fairly
modest
amounts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
five
minutes
is
the
five
minutes
that
you
perhaps
wanted
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
winer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
your
view
the
recipient
of
the
escheats
have
been
benefited
by
the
services
rendered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
the
same
result
take
place
if
it
went
back
to
boeing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
issue
isn't
before
us
just
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
issue
is
not
before
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
afford
to
be
indifferent
because
the
lien
follows,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fee
is
fixed.
how
do
you
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
not
be
irrelevant
entirely
if
your
theory
is,
as
i
understood
it
to
be,
that
your
action
has
benefited
someone
and
it
is
now
merely
a
matter
of
49
percent
going
to
one
group
and
perhaps
51
percent
going
to
boeing
or
new
york
or
washington?
someone
will
have
benefited
from
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
then
would
it
make
any
difference
who
those
$128,000
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
1327,
boeing
company
against
van
gemert
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
