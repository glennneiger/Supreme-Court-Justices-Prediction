mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
that
court
granted
respondent
collateral
relief
from
his
conviction
on
the
ground
that
certain
testimony
admitted
at
his
trial
of
a
jail
cellmate
was
admitted
in
violation
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
in
the
fall
of
1972,
respondent
was
arrested
and
indicted
on
a
charge
of
participation
in
a
bank
robbery
in
norfolk,
virginia.
at
his
trial
some
months
later,
the
prosecution's
evidence
included
the
testimony
of
two
individuals
who
had
been
cellmates
of
respondent's
at
the
norfolk
jail
during
the
period
between
respondent's
indictment
and
his
trial.
one
of
the
cellmates,
nichols,
was
a
government
informant,
the
other
saddler
was
not.
both
men
testified
about
damaging
admissions
that
respondent
had
made
to
them
which
indicated
that
he
was
a
participant
in
the
bank
robbery.
several
years
later,
respondent
filed
a
motion
for
collateral
relief
in
which
he
charged
for
the
first
time,
among
other
things,
that
the
admission
of
nichols'
testimony
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
his
motion
was
denied,
but
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
inquiry
into
the
claim.
on
remand,
the
district
court
again
denied
the
motion
without
a
hearing
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
submitted
by
the
two
fbi
agents
regarding
the
nature
of
their
contacts
with
the
witness
nichols.
the
significant
affidavit
for
purposes
of
this
case
was
that
of
agent
coughlan.
perhaps
the
best
way
to
put
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today
into
focus,
is
if
i
read
the
pertinent
excerpts
from
his
affidavit
which
are
at
page
--
begin
at
page
57
(a)
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
agent
coughlan
averred
that
on
november
21,
1972,
i
contacted
it
with
benjamin
nichols
at
the
norfolk
city
jail.
nichols
had
been
contacted
by
me
for
approximately
a
year
prior
to
this
and
during
my
contacts
with
him
he
had
provided
confidential
information
to
the
fbi
and
had
been
paid
for
it.
the
time
that
i
contacted
nichols,
nichols
advice
that
he
was
in
the
same
cellblock
as
billy
gale
henry
as
well
as
other
prisoners
who
had
federal
charges
against
them.
i
recall
telling
nichols
at
this
time
to
be
alert
to
any
statements
made
by
these
individuals
regarding
the
charges
against
them.
i
specifically
recall
telling
nichols
that
he
was
not
to
question
henry
or
these
individuals
about
the
charges
against
them,
however,
but
if
they
engaged
them
in
conversation
or
talked
in
front
of
him,
he
was
requested
to
pay
attention
to
their
statements.
i
recall
telling
nichols
not
to
initiate
any
conversations
with
henry
regarding
the
bank
robbery
charges
against
henry
that
if
henry
initiated
the
conversations
with
nichols,
i
requested
nichols
to
pay
attention
to
the
information
furnished.
the
affidavit
goes
on
to
relate
the
provision
of
information
to
--
by
nichols
to
the
agent
after
nichols
got
out
of
jail
and
then
it
states
at
page
59
(a),
nichols
was
paid
by
the
fbi
for
expenses
and
services
in
connection
with
the
request
that
henry
had
made
of
him
in
jail
and
for
the
information
furnished
by
nichols.
finally,
it
says
i
never
requested
that
anyone
affiliated
with
the
norfolk
city
jail
to
place
edward
benjamin
nichols
in
the
same
cell
of
henry.
now,
on
the
basis
essentially
of
this
affidavit,
the
district
court
denied
relief
and
on
exactly
the
same
basis,
the
court
of
appeals
majority
upheld
respondent's
sixth
amendment
claim.
the
court
described
the
issue
before
it
is
whether
undisclosed
government
monitoring
of
respondent's
conversations
while
he
was
in
custody
violated
his
right
to
counsel.
in
responding
to
the
government's
argument
based
on
language
in
brewer
against
williams
suggesting
that
some
form
of
interrogation
is
a
prerequisite
to
finding
a
massiah
violation,
the
court
held
that
requirement
satisfied
by
general
conversation.
the
holding
which
is
under
review
today
may
perhaps
best
be
summarized
in
the
following
statement
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
in
the
instant
case,
even
if
we
assume
that
nichols
obeyed
these
instructions
not
to
interrogate
henry
about
the
bank
robbery,
nichols
did
testify
that
he
engaged
in
conversation
with
his
cellmate
henry.
if
by
association,
by
general
conversation
or
both,
henry
developed
sufficient
confidents
in
nichols
that
nichols
bared,
excuse
me,
that
henry
bared
his
incriminating
secrets
to
a
non-disclose
paid
informer,
we
think
that
there
was
interrogation
within
the
meaning
of
brewer
and
therefore
violation
of
the
massiah
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
question
of
law
as
the
case
now
stands.
unfortunately,
the
facts
are
not
very
well
developed,
but
in
effect
what
happened
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
granted
summary
judgment
against
us,
determining
that
the
mere
fact
that
nichols
was
informant,
that
he
shared
cell
with
henry
and
then
he
engaged
in
general
conversation
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
granted
relief
without
a
hearing
having
been
held
on
the
facts.
in
other
words,
they
granted
a
relief
on
the
assumption
that
the
fact
that
there
was
association
and
general
conversation
was
sufficient
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
massiah
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
habeas
petitioner
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
however,
if
as
here
was
the
case,
it
is
conceded
the
operative
facts
on
which
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
rested
or
conceded
by
the
government
and
i
think
they
are,
then
this
court
can
review
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
was
enough
to
grant
relief.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
issue
posed
by
this
case,
i
think
there
are
two
different
sets
of
variables
to
be
considered.
the
first
set
involves
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
came
to
share
a
cell
with
the
defendant
and
agreed
to
testify
at
trial
on
the
prosecution's
behalf.
the
one
extreme
is
a
case
like
milton
against
wainwright,
where
an
undercover
officer
posing
as
fellow
inmate,
is
deliberately
placed
in
the
defendant
cell.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
think
the
case
turns
on
that.
that
is
we
think
that
they
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
in
either
event,
but
in
this
case,
as
the
record
stands,
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
deliberately
placed
in
there
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
statements
from
the
respondent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
say
that
you
could
not
sustain
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
even
if
he
were
deliberately
placed
there.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
make
no
difference,
it's
a
little
hard
for
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
believe
we
should
win
even
if
he
were
deliberately
placed
there
as
long
as
there
was
not
the
kind
of
deliberate
elicitation
or
interrogation
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'd
be
happy
to
discuss
that
now
if
you
like
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
certainly
will
direct
myself
to
that.
apart
from
the
situation
where
an
officer
is
put
in
the
cell
as
in
milton,
at
the
other
extreme
it's
the
not
uncommon
situation
where
a
cellmate
of
a
defendant
comes
to
the
authorities,
tells
them
that
the
defendant
is
talking
about
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
and
offers
to
inform
the
authorities
about
the
defendant's
statements.
this
case
is
somewhere
in
between
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i'm
talking
about
state,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
no
problem
it
would
be
the
statements
made
thereafter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
no
issue
as
to
statements
already
made.
now,
the
second
kind
of
variable
and
the
one
that
is
perhaps
in
the
forefront
of
the
present
case
concerns
the
nature
of
the
relationship
or
interaction
between
the
witness
and
the
defendant.
again,
the
possibilities
can
be
rated
along
the
spectrum.
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
is
an
informant
in
an
adjoining
cell
to
the
defendants
who
simply
overhears
incriminating
statements,
but
has
no
interaction
whatsoever
with
the
defendant.
at
the
other
end
is
the
situation
in
milton
in
which
an
extended
and
calculated
effort
is
made
to
“open
the
defendant
up
by
repeated
questioning
about
the
crime
of
which
the
defendant
stands
charged.
now
unless
the
rationale
underlying
the
massiah
doctrine
is
to
be
entirely
reexamined,
it
seems
clear
that
the
milton
situation
constitutes
a
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel.
conversely,
i
see
absolutely
nothing
in
the
court's
opinions
on
the
subject
to
suggest
that
the
purely
passive
overhearing
of
conversations
between
the
defendants
and
some
third-party,
other
than
the
defendant's
lawyer,
could
properly
be
held
to
evade
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
that
would
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
there
might
be
fourth
amendment
question.
that
is
similar
to
the
issue
in
the
hearst,
patty
hearst
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
believe
that
that
was
correctly
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
he
speaks
to
another
convict,
who
was
not
a
government
agent
there
is
no
massiah
issue
whatsoever.
so,
i'm
assuming
in
this
hypothetical
that
the
agent
is
silent
in
the
next
cell
or
prison
guard
who
walks
by
and
overhears
the
statement,
that
is
i'm
talking
about
obtaining
statement
with
absolutely
no
act
or
effort
on
the
part
the
government
and
i
view
that
as
one
polar
extreme
in
the
act
of
effort
to
open
up
a
defendant
by
intensive
interrogation
about
the
offense
to
be
the
other
polar
extreme.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
question
that
this
man
was
a
government.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
know
that
he
was
paid
at
some
point
for
the
information
that
he
provided.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
what
he
was
instructed
to
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
true.
no,
i'm
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
there
is
no
basis
in
any
of
these
court's
decisions
to
suggest
that
the
transmitter
would
violate
the
right
to
counsel
and
while
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
initially
cast
the
issue
in
terms
of
monitoring
the
defendant's
conversations,
i
don't
think
even
its
decision
really
can
be
read
to
hold
that
near
overhearing
violates
the
right
to
counsel.
they
relied
on
also
the
fact
that
there
was
conversation
between
the
witness
informant
and
the
defendant.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
the
court
did
not
require
that
the
conversation
relate
in
any
way
to
the
defendant's
case.
accordingly,
the
narrow
question
before
the
court
is
whether
general
conversation
about
sports,
the
weather
or
other
neutral
topics
makes
any
incriminating
statements
thereafter
volunteered
by
the
defendant
to
a
cellmate,
inadmissible.
now
as
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
theory
for
finding
a
violation
in
such
circumstances
is
thereby
manifesting
friendliness
the
informant
will
create
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
defendant
is
more
likely
to
trust
him
and
to
reveal
incriminating
information.
now,
it
seems
plain
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
cannot
be
squared
either
with
the
past
descriptions
of
the
kind
of
conduct
that
the
massiah
rule
prohibits
or
with
the
right
to
counsel
rationale
of
that
rule.
looking
first
at
what
the
court
has
said
is
prohibited
the
massiah
opinion
speaks
of
deliberate
elucidation.
now,
elucidation
is
a
somewhat
vague
term,
but
to
me
it
clearly
suggests
some
kind
of
drawing
out,
of
overcoming
some
resistance
to
speak
or
at
least
of
constructing
some
artificial
situation
that
is
particularly
likely
to
produce
the
desired
statements.
massiah
in
fact
involves
specific
questioning
of
the
defendant
about
the
crime
by
being
informant
and
in
brewer,
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
interrogation
or
something
quite
like
it
is
the
touchstone
for
finding
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
holding
is
that
the
right
to
counsel
was
violated
by
what
was
tantamount
to
interrogation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
however,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
no
case
of
this
court
saying
that
there's
no
violation
in
any
circumstances
that
had
been
before
this
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there's
nothing
in
mcleod
to
suggest
that
there
was
not
interrogation.
if
you
go
back
to
the
opinion
of
the
ohio
court,
the
court
does
refer
to
the
statements
having
been
voluntarily
made,
but
i
believe
in
context
that
is
a
reference
to
their
having
been
uncoerced
and
not
a
reference
to
their
having
been
spontaneous.
the
issue
in
mcleod
and
this
is
a
problem
in
dealing
with
a
summary
disposition
without
opinion
is
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
in
mcleod
that
if
an
indicted
defendant
who
did
not
yet
had
counsel
did
not
have
the
right
to
counsel
under
massiah.
so,
that
it's
hard
to
tell
what
the
court's
reversal
was
based
on.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
the
brady
case
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
brady,
yes.
that
is
unquestionably
the
closest
i
think
that
the
court
has
come
to
holding
that
letting
the
defendant
tell
you
all
facts
about
the
crime
violates
massiah.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
(voice

mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
question
when
i
used
the
word
“defendant”
i
am
referring
to
somebody
who
was
(voice

mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
indeed
it
does.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
haven't
and
i'm
almost
certain
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
to
the
minister
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
a
warden
is
also
an
agent
of
the
government.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he's
paid.
he
works
for
the
government

mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
no
not
in
colloquial
sense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
warden
is
not
a
(voice
overlap)
or
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
come
back
to
make
the
point
that
i
slightly
lost
touch
with
here
about
what
brewer
does
hold
in
response
to
justice
white's
question.
it's
true
that
the
state
lost
brewer,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
opinion
in
brewer
makes
clear
that
there
was
both
extended
association
and
general
conversation
over
a
wide-ranging
variety
of
topics
and
yet
the
courts
said
that
these
ingredients
alone
would
not
render
william's
incriminating
statements
and
actions
admissible,
at
least
that
is
how
i
read
the
statement
by
the
court.
no
constitutional
protection
would
have
come
in
to
play
if
there
had
been
no
interrogation.
now,
they
would
hardly
have
been
any
need
for
the
court
in
brewer
to
engage
in
the
extended
analysis
of
whether
the
“christian
burial
speech”
constituted
an
interrogation
if
the
mere
fact
that
detective
captain
leaming
was
in
the
car
and
being
friendly
to
williams
was
enough
to
cause
any
statements
that
williams
made
to
violate
massiah.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
statement
in
this
case?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
have
this
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
we
do
dispute
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
informant
--
we
don't
have
an
affidavit
from
the
informant
in
the
record
in
this
case.
all
we
have
is
the
testimony
of
the
informant
at
trial
and
i
don't
recall
that
the
testimony
specifically
denied
interrogating
him
but
i
do
find
judge
butzner's
opinion
very
strange
in
this
regard
that
the
assertion
of
the
petitioner
in
a
2255
petition
that
there
was
interrogation
which
is
illegal
term
which
--
about
which
much
ink
has
been
spilled
by
the
scholars
after
brewer
against
william
should
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
now,
let
me
try
to
address
a
point
that
justice
stewart
made
about
the
turning
from
brewer
itself
to
the
sixth
amendment
policies
that
underlie
the
right
to
counsel
principle
that's
involved
here.
the
main
stream
of
the
court's
sixth
amendment
cases
have,
starting
with
powell
against
alabama,
have
dealt
with
the
formal
judicial
proceeding
that
is
various
stages
of
pre-trial
which
have
a
degree
of
formality
where
defendant
is
facing
unfamiliar
surroundings,
complex
legal
issues
and
an
experienced
prosecutor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
those
are
things
that
follow
indictment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
i
can
--
i
agree
with
that
completely
and
in
those
cases,
the
need
for
counsel
is
obvious
when
we
are
talking
about
those
proceedings.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'd
rather
not
get
involved.
[laughter]
the
--
to
me
the
reasons
for
implicating
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
massiah
setting
are
less
obvious
than
they
are
in
the
formal
judicial
proceedings
setting
and
neither
massiah
nor
brewer
undertake
a
detail
analysis
of
the
connection
between
the
suppress
statements
and
the
role
that
counsel
would
play.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
coming
to
that.
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
think
the
best
sources
for
understanding
the
applicable
policies
are
your
concurring
opinion
in
spano
and
the
court's
opinion
in
ash.
now,
ash
speaks
of
trial
like
confrontations
and
as
i
read
the
spano
opinion,
it
focuses
on
the
notion
that
extra
judicial
interrogation
of
the
accused
which
was
unquestionably
what
there
was
in
spano,
constitutes
in
effect
the
pre-trial
trial,
a
trial
outside
the
trial
to
invert
the
hamlet
metaphor.
now,
bringing
these
notions
to
bear
upon
the
present
case,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
about
association
and
general
conversation
among
cellmates
in
a
jail
that
remotely
resembles
the
trial
type
confrontation
that
brings
the
requirement
that
counsel
be
present
into
play.
it
seems
to
me
that
only
if
there
is
specific
questioning
by
a
government
agent
designed
to
elicit
information
about
the
offense
or
some
other
actions
or
statements
uniquely
likely
to
draw
the
defendant
out
on
the
subject
to
overcome
his
reticence
to
reveal
what
he
knows
that
we
have
the
necessary
pre-conditions
for
recognition
of
a
right
to
counsel,
that
we
have
a
basis
to
say,
“yes,
this
is
really
part
of
the
trial.”
this
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
prosecution
which
is
the
standard
that
has
been
used
in
sixth
amendment
cases.
now,
it's
true
i
think
that
when
he
makes
a
confession
to
a
cellmate
who's
going
to
report
that
that
is
critical,
but
it
is
not,
i
believe
at
stage
of
the
prosecution
unless
it
emerges
out
of
a
proceeding
that
in
some
way
resembles
the
trial
type
proceeding
and
at
least
that's
the
way
i
read
spano
and
ash.
in
the
present
case,
the
record
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
respondent
was
quite
willing
to
volunteer
information
about
the
crime
and
denied
the
specific
interrogation
or
any
kind
of
trick
was
necessary
to
draw
him
out
on
the
subject.
accordingly,
i
think
the
record
falls
far
short
of
justifying
the
relief
recorded
him
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
know
that,
we
don't
know
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
we
would
have
to
know
more.
i
mean
we
can
spin
the
endless
hypotheticals
about
things
that
could've
going
on
in
the
cell
and
ask
ourselves
whether
that
would
or
would
be
the
kind
of
trial
like
confrontations
for
which
counsel
is
thought
to
be
justified
under
the
massiah
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
frankly
somewhat
at
a
loss
because
the
sources
in
terms
of
this
court's
decisions
to
draw
on
a
relatively
limit
in
terms
of
an
explication
of
what
the
concept
of
deliberately
elicited
means.
i
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
the
expression
in
massiah
deliberately
elicited.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
although
i
think
there
is
a
reference
to
deliberately
elicited
as
well.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
are
several
places
where
the
topic
is
touched
upon
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
except
that
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
opinion
says
that
--
i
will
see
if
i
can
find
the
place.
all
right,
there
are
several
places
in
the
opinion
where
it
refers
to,
you
cite
with
approval
for
instance
judge
hay's
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
was
not
much.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
(voice
overlap)
deliberately
elicit,
it
didn't
say
deliberately
was
elicited
or
acquired,
it
said
deliberately
elicited.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
mean
in
my
view,
i
confess
that
i
have
some
difficulty
in
evaluating
it.
our
brief
addresses
the
somewhat
what
the
connection
is
between
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
not
to
have
the
statements
admitted.
in
trying
to
discern
them
looking
at
sources
that
have
explained
it
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
in
my
understanding
is
this
notion
that
what
is
going
on
outside
the
trial,
there
is
the
characteristics
that
sufficiently
resemble
a
trial
that
a
lawyer
should
be
there.
and
i
don't
think
sitting
--
i
don't
think
jail
house
banter
about
the
weather
or
other
kinds
of
things
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
different
only
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
issue
at
all
about
the
admissibility
of
the
statements
if
he
were
not
a
government
agent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
clear
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
our
position
is
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
the
alternative
it
seems
to
me
is
to
push
these
principles
to
their
logical
extreme
because
of
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line
and
to
end
up
with
the
situation
where
you
simply
can't
overhear
the
defendant.
i
mean
suppose
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
but
the
government
does
have
to
stop
investigating
a
crime
because
the
defendant
has
been
indicted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
and
that
is
what
massiah
and
brewer
held.
we
can't
take
him
off
by
himself
and
ask
questions
but
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
four
or
five
cellmates
in
a
cell
in
the
norfolk
jail
who
for
all
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
not
--
well,
usually
by
the
time
of
indictment
although
often
there
are
cases
where
more
evidence
would
be
very
helpful
at
getting
an
accurate
outcome
of
the
trial.
let
me
just
turn
my
second
point
for
one
minute
because
my
time
is
short
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
agency
of
the
informant
and
i
just
want
to
make
one
point.
here,
we
had
mr.
nichols
in
the
jail
and
he
knew
from
his
past
experiences
i
expect
most
people
in
jail
cells
probably
know
that
if
they
can
provide
information
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
prosecution
on
one
of
their
cellmates
they
could
expect
some
kind
of
consideration
for
this
information.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
if
nichols
had
not
talked
to
agent
coughlan,
but
had
simply
in
the
expectation
that
he
would
probably
get
something
listened
though
a
saddler
did
and
then
come
forward
afterwards
there
would
be
no
issue
in
this
case
from
the
massiah
violation.
yet,
what
we
have
here
is
that
nichols
and
the
agent
communicate,
the
result
of
this
communication
is
not
really
to
impart
any
new
information
to
nichols
that
the
fbi
would
like
any
confessions
that
henry
makes,
nichols
knew
that,
but
to
impose
constraints
on
the
way
nichols'
behaves.
to
tell
nichols,
look
we
have
to
have
a
scrupulous
regard
for
the
sixth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
agent
certainly
was
acting
scrupulously.
the
government,
we
are
talking
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we're
talking
about
excluding
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
can't
say
that.
i'm
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
told
not
to
question
him.
i
mean
one
of
the
issues
that
would
raise
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
we
that
don't
know
that
he
questioned
him.
that
is
the
very
issue
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
little
time
i
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there's
just
a
couple
of
points.
i
want
to
make
clear
what
our
position
is.
it's
not
that
the
informant
can't
open
his
mouth.
it
said
the
informant
can't
lead
the
defendant
to
talk
about
the
subject
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
talked
about.
now,
with
respect
to
justice
marshall's
question
of
professor
geltner,
i
think
it's
quite
clearly
our
view
that
we
could
send
somebody
down
to
the
bar
to
listen
because
we
expect
him
to
make
statements
at
the
bar
about
the
crime
and
we
could
use
those
statements
without
violating
massiah.
our
motive
to
acquire
information
in
my
view
is
clearly
not
enough
in
the
court
unless
we
do
something
more
that
constitutes
elicitation
by
us
the
court
is
being
led
to
what
seems
to
me
an
extreme
position
and
it
is
an
extreme
position
which
is
not
the
defensible
under
the
right
to
counsel
rationale.
i
did
not
hear
professor
geltner
once
to
explain
why
the
right
to
counsel
is
implicated
in
the
listening
post
kind
of
situation.
the
concept
of
interrogation
did
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
okay.
