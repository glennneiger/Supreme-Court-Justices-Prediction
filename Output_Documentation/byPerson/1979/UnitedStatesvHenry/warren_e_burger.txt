chief
justice

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
henry.
mr.
frey,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
--
the
case
turns
on
whether
he
was
deliberately
placed
there
or
he
got
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
should
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption,
among
other
things,
that
he
was
deliberately
placed
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
about
placing
a
transmitter
right
in
the
cell,
not
a
person
but
transmitter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
didn't
ask
questions,
he'd
be
like,
he'd
be
in
a
passive
role
like
the
transmitter
bug,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
said
transmitter
would
be
alright
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
statement
of
the
defendant
that
the
conversation
was
in
reality
a
form
of
interrogation
disputed
categorically
anywhere
or
other
than
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
referring
to
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
butzner
who
says
nevertheless
absent
testimony
by
the
informant
where
he
suggested
that
there
should
have
been
a
hearing
by
the
district
judge
on
this
issue,
absent
testimony
by
the
informant
about
what
he
said
to
the
defendant,
the
judgment
must
be
reversed
because
of
the
informant's
admission
that
he
had
conversed
with
the
defendant
and
because
of
the
defendant's
assertion
that
the
conversation
was
a
form
of
questioning
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
now,
is
that
disputed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
informant
dispute
to
that
at
any
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
(voice
overlap)
but
the
informant,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gletner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he'd
be
the
passive
of
a
person
like
the
passive
electronic
about
you
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
his
limitation
is
narrow,
the
thrust
of
the
court's
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
he's
indicating
he
agrees
with
the
limitations
expressed
in
his
concurring
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
draw
the
line
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
draw
the
line
on
whether
this
is
pursuant
to
arrangements
made
in
advance
as
distinguished
from
something
that
develops
after
the
event?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
if
the
arrangements
are
made
in
advance
then
the
listening
post
to
this
an
agent
if
they're
not
made
in
advance
then
he
is
just
an
ordinary
informant
like
any
other
witness
for
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
have
your
point
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen
the
case
is
submitted.
