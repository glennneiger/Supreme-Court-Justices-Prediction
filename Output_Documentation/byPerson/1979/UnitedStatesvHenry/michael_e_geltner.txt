mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
view,
the
court
of
appeals
was
perfectly
correct
both
in
its
view
of
the
law
and
in
its
handling
of
the
case
given
its
peculiar
procedural
history.
if
we
look
at
that
procedural
history,
what
we
say
is
first
of
all
the
fact
that
the
trial
testimony
of
mr.
nichols
came
before
the
jury
without
any
knowledge
of,
excuse
me,
on
the
part
of
the
defense
that
mr.
nichols
was
an
informant
and
because
of
that
the
deficiency
in
the
development
of
the
record
as
to
the
way
in
which
he
and
mr.
henry
interacted.
the
issue
was
squarely
put
by
the
first
motion
to
vacate
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
it
without
a
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
then
remanded
to
the
district
judge
with
an
opinion
in
which
it
explained
to
district
judge
what
facts
to
find
and
the
district
judge
rather
than
holding
that
evidentiary
hearing,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
prosecutor,
indicating
that
he
believe
the
matter
could
be
disposed
of
without
the
necessity
of
a
public
hearing
and
advised
them
if
the
agents
did
request
mr.
nichols
or
sabbath
to
interview
henry,
we
probably
will
have
to
grant
the
hearing.
at
that
point,
the
affidavit
of
agent
coughlan
comes
forward
and
says
that
he
advised
mr.
nichols
not
to
initiate
conversations
with
regard
to
the
bank
robbery
or
to
question
mr.
henry.
now,
in
that
light,
i
think
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
saw
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
record
was
adequate
for
outright
reversal
of
the
conviction
or
whether
on
the
contrary,
it
made
sense
to
remand
one
more
time
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
with
that
in
mind,
i'd
like
to
going
on
and
take
a
look
at
the
record
because
i
believe
the
record
strongly
supports
the
conclusion
that
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
no
matter
how
we
interpret
the
massiah
decision.
we
know
from
the
record
that
the
bank
robbery
occurred
on
the
28th
of
august
of
1972
and
on
that
date,
mr.
moore
and
mr.
locke
were
arrested
and
charged
with
a
crime.
on
the
22nd
of
september,
a
complaint
was
sworn
out
by
agent
o'hara,
who
was
the
supervising
agent
in
charge
of
the
investigation,
which
indicates
that
at
that
time
the
case
against
mr.
henry
consisted
of
the
fbi's
knowledge
that
he
had
participated
in
the
rental
of
the
house
on
wales
avenue
in
norfolk
at
which
mr.
moore
and
mr.
locke
were
arrested.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
quite
the
contrary
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
saw
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
conviction
should
be
set
aside
or
whether
or
not
a
hearing,
which
would
have
filled
out
the
record
on
the
interaction
between
mr.
henry
and
mr.
nichols,
was
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
your
honor,
precisely
and
a
point
of
my
summary
of
the
record
now
is
to
establish
that
he
record
is
quite
adequate
to
support
that
conclusion.
as
i
was
saying,
when
the
complaint
was
sworn
out
in
september
with
the
case
against
mr.
henry
consisted
of
was
evidence
that
he
was
connected
with
the
rental
of
the
house
which
was
mr.
moore
and
mr.
locke
were
found
in.
on
the
8th
of
november,
the
warrant
turned
up
in
atlanta,
georgia
and
on
the
10th
of
november,
mr.
henry
was
arrested
in
atlanta,
georgia.
on
the
15th
of
november,
mr.
henry
was
indicted
and
charged
with
the
crime.
on
the
21st
of
november,
1972,
after
a
period
of
transit
mr.
henry
arrived
in
norfolk
was
put
in
a
norfolk
city
jail.
at
that
time,
from
all
we
can
tell
from
the
record
and
i
think
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
the
government's
case
still
consisted
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
a
participant
in
the
rental
of
the
hideout.
on
the
21st
of
november,
agent
o'hara
visits
mr.
henry
in
the
norfolk
city
jail,
interrogates
him
of
that
and
finally
mr.
henry
refuses
to
answer
questions.
according
to
agent
o'hara
mr.
--
and
his
testimony
which
is
at
the
transcript
page
106,
mr.
henry
stated
he
would
not
like
to
answer
general
questions
in
regards
to
his
activities
as
he
was
afraid,
we
would
change
his
answers
around.
on
the
same
day,
without
any
more
of
a
case
then
i've
already
laid
out,
on
the
very
same
day
mr.
coughlan
tells
us
from
his
affidavit,
agent
coughlan,
said
he
went
to
visit
mr.
nichols
in
the
norfolk
city
jail
at
which
time
he
gave
him
instructions
with
regard
to
mr.
henry
and
although
the
affidavit
of
agent
coughlan
tells
us
that
he
placed
limitations
on
what
he
wanted
mr.
nichols
to
do,
it
also
tells
us
that
he
advised
mr.
nichols
that
there
was
a
bank
robbery,
a
bank
robbery
charge
against
mr.
henry
and
what
the
agency
was
interested
in
was
getting
statements
about
the
bank
robbery.
it
was
quite
clear
even
if
we
believe
that
mr.
--
agent
coughlan's
affidavit
in
all
of
its
nuances
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
put
mr.
nichols
on
notice
precisely
as
to
what
he
wanted.
on
the
27th
of
november,
mr.
henry
appeared
in
court
for
arraignment
for
the
--
this
is
the
first
court
appearance
that
we
know
from
record
on
the
morning
he
appeared
without
counsel
before
judge
mckenzie.
judge
mckenzie
asked
him
if
he
wanted
counsel,
he
said
he
did
and
judge
mckenzie
appointed
counsel.
there
was
a
recess
taken
and
mr.
henry
was
arraigned
that
afternoon
and
appeared
in
court.
the
next
thing
the
record
tells
us
is
that
on
the
sixth
of
december,
agent
coughlan
again
visited
with
nichols
and
nichols
told
him
what
information
he
had
obtained
from
mr.
henry.
the
information
was
essentially
the
same
information
that
he
testified
to
a
trial,
this
we
get
from
agent
coughlan's
affidavit.
now,
if
we
--
so,
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
period
of
time
from
the
21st
of
november
through
the
sixth
of
december
during
the
majority
of
which
period
nichols
and
henry
and
others
were
in
jail
together.
now,
if
we
look
at
nichols'
trial
testimony
which
admittedly
is
not
laid
out
in
--
admittedly
was
not
the
result
of
specific
questioning
on
what
happened
between
nichols
and
henry,
we
nevertheless
see
that
the
conversations
that
occurred
between
henry
and
nichols
were
quite
directed
and
related
quite
specifically
to
the
crime
in
question.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
he
was
arraigned
and
counsel
was
appointed
on
27th
of
november.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
appears
--
it
appears
in
the
record
on
page
1
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
second
reference
november
28th
court
proceedings
before
jam
who
was
judge
mckenzie.
that
should
be
november
27th
not
28th.
the
appendix
has
an
error,
i
checked
it
myself.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
appendix
is
an
error.
the
record
indicates,
the
docket
sheet
in
the
record
indicates
november
27th.
the
entry
immediately
below
that
november
27
cja,
20
appointment
and
voucher
for
counseling
services.
so
what
we
have
is
the
date
of
appointment
of
counsel
for
some
time
in
the
middle
of
the
period
during
which
the
jail
interrogation
eliciting
obtaining
or
whatever
occurred,
the
indictment
preceded
the
entire
period
falling
on
november
15th.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
nichols'
conversations
with
henry
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
in
the
jail
cell
occurred
sometime
between
the
21st
of
november
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
and
the
sixth
of
december.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
all
of
which
all
post
indictment
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
much
is
clear
as
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
aware
the
case
is
interpreting
--
the
cases
in
this
court
interpreting
massiah
some
of
them
involved
counsel
plus
indictment
some
of
them
involved
simple
indictment.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
massiah
and
brewer
both
involved
counsel
plus
indictment.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
(voice
overlap)
in
mccloud
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
in
brewer
involve
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
formal
charge
is
not
yet
--
not
indictment
yet
but
there
have
been
a
counsel
in
the
case
formal
charges
had
been
filed.
in
mccloud,
the
statement
was
obtained
after
indictment,
but
before
counsel
came
in
to
the
case.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that's
likewise
true
in
the
brady
case.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
brady
was
a
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
your
honor.
i'd
be
happy
to
address
those
now.
in
the
hoffa
case
we
are
face
with
three
issues,
the
fourth
amendment
question,
the
self
incrimination
question
and
the
right
to
counsel
question.
on
the
right
to
counsel
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hoffa
case
turns
on
the
proposition
that
the
evidence
obtained
from
hoffa
by
the
undercover
agent
partin
was
used
in
another
case
and
that
if
the
information
had
been
obtained
four
years
in
the
case
before
the
court
at
the
time
then
we
have
massiah.
by
that,
i
mean
if
the
court,
if
you
remember
your
honor,
hoffa
was
on
trial
in
something
referred
to
the
opinion
is
the
test
fleet
trial
and
mr.
partin
came
to
see
him
in
an
undercover
role
while
he
was
awaiting
trial
during
the
period
of
the
trial.
the
testimony
that
partin
gave
that
was
before
this
court
was
his
testimony
in
the
jury
tampering
trial
which
resulted
from,
in
part
from
the
information
that
he
developed.
on
the
sixth
amendment
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
turns
on
that
and
the
court
--
in
the
court's
opinion
we
see
a
reference
to
that
part
of
the
massiah
opinion
said
--
which
says
that
the
crucial
question
is
whether
or
not
information
in
the
pending
case
is
elicited
and
used
in
the
pending
case.
with
regard
to
hearst,
hearst
of
course
relates
to
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
question
before
as
to
the
placement
of
a
listening
device.
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
hearst
turns
on
the
fact
that
the
listening
device
is
a
listening
device
which
was
generally
available
and
used
in
that
jail
for
the
purpose
of
monitoring
security
matters.
the
statement
was
not
made
to
an
agent
nor
was
the
listening
device
placed
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
in
the
pending
case.
that
was
an
accident
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
hearst
and
i
prefer
to
rest
at
this
point
on
that
distinction.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
that's
sufficient
to
distinguish
from
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
must
attempt
to
obtain
information
in
the
pending
case
from
somebody
against
whom
the
indictment
is
pending.
that's
what
makes
it
a
violation.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
unconnected
with
the
case?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
in
your
example
your
honor
if
the
warden
is
waiting
in
his
office
and
mr.
henry
goes
up
and
says
“i'd
like
to
confess
today.”
the
fact
that
he
is
–
that
the
warden
is
a
government
employee
does
not
in
my
opinion
make
out
a
violation
of
massiah.
if
the
warden
or
anybody
else
is
procured
to
attempt
to
get
mr.
henry
to
do
so
then
it
seems
to
me
that
makes
out
a
violation
of
massiah.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
i
have
to
agree
with
mr.
frey
on
that
your
honor
that
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
massiah
right
because
that
is
not
the
government
obtaining
information
(voice

--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
from
the
accused
(voice

--
after
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
word
is
put
at?
well,
i
think
we
probably
reach
(voice

the
point
which
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
i
have
to
still
agree
with
mr.
frey
that
that's
not
this
case
and
that
is
not
a
government
agent.
the
--
at
some
point
the
government
makes
somebody
an
agent
when
it
seeks
to
have
him
do
its
bidding
and
he
does
so.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
put
there
to
obtain
information,
(voice

--
that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
sir.
the
listening
post
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
same
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
that's
a
violation
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
if
the
agent
went
there
for
that
purpose
yes
your
honor.
if
somebody
else
sitting
at
the
bar
happens
to
turn
up
and
testifies
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
that's
the
warden
in
justice
rehnquist's
example
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that's
why
i'm
summarizing
the
facts
your
honor.
i
think
that's
right,
i
think
that's
been
pointed
out
in
some
of
the
opinions
in
brewer
that
is
that
it's
essentially
a
factual
inquiry.
i
think
it's
mr.
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
brewer
that
points
out
that
the
subjective
intention
of
the
agent
is
very
important
in
these
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
of
course
not
your
honor.
(voice

mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that's
precisely
where
i
was
going
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
with
my
recitation
of
the
record.
i
had
a
reason.
one
of
my
reasons
is
to
request
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
testimony
of
mr.
nichols'
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
precisely
the
same
as
mine.
i
think
that's
the
import
of
judge
butzner's
opinion
(voice

--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
then
--
mr.
michael

geltner
well,
judge
winter's
opinion
which
is
the
majority
opinion
that
which
mr.
butzner's
occurred
with
says,
“if
by
association
by
general
conversation
or
both
henry
developed
sufficient
confidence
in
nichols'
that
henry
bared
his
incriminating
secrets,
we
have
a
violation
and
then
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
is
either
or
judge
winters'
opinion
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
is
either
or.
judge
butzner's
opinion
placed
his
greater
emphasize
in
my
opinion
on
the
fact
that
here
we
have
a
record
which
indicates
that
there
were
some
conversations
between
nichols'
and
henry
in
those
conversation
for
about
the
subject
to
the
bank
robbery.
(voice

--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
he
did
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion,
i
think
they
do.
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
and
as
i
was
indicating
i
think
that
they
read
the
record
well
and
fairly.
on
page
134
of
the
transcript
which
is
the
first
page
of
nichols'
testimony,
mr.
nichols'
has
asked
the
question,
“did
you
have
an
opportunity
to
have
some
conversations
with
henry
while
he
was
in
the
jail?”
some
conversations,
we're
not
talking
about
somebody
who
sat
there
is
a
listening
post.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
that's
correct
and
i
think
particularly
judge
winter's
opinion
which
uses
an
either
or
if
by
association
by
general
conversation
or
both
which
i
think
is
either
or.
i
think
judge
winter's
opinion
means
either
is
enough.
i
think
judge
butzner's
opinion
does
not
place
it
in
terms
of
either
or
and
i
think
the
record
doesn't
require
it
and
i
think
that's
probably
the
most
important
thing
for
the
decision
today.
the
record
does
not
require
it.
i
want
the
court
to
understand
my
position.
my
position
is
that
any
efforts
by
the
government
to
obtain
information
for
use
in
the
pending
trial
against
to
whom
they
have
a
pending
indictment
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
unless
there
has
been
a
suitable
waiver
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
(voice
overlap)
happened
to
this
case
or
--
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
unless,
there
has
been
a
suitable
waiver
or
unless
counsel's
present.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
we
would
have
terrific
fourth
amendment
problem
but
your
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
you
need
to
address
to
the
six
amendment
question.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
and
i
think
that's
hearst.
i
think
that
my
position
on
that
is
the
same
as
my
position
on
hearst
that
is
if
the
purpose
is
something
other
than
to
obtain
information
for
use
in
pending
cases
against
to
whom
there
are
people
who
have
a
right
to
counsel
then
it's
a
violation.
if
the
purpose
is
general,
security
measures
for
example,
then
i
think
that
that
i
have
to
concede
that's
not
a
violation
on
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
then
i
think
we've
got
something
more
like
brewer
than
we
have
here
that
is
we
have
the
possibility
of
waiver.
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
all
of
the
opinions
in
the
brewer
case
that
it
is
possible
for
somebody
who
has
a
right
to
counsel
because
of
indictment
or
formal
ever
certain
settings
to
wave
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
might
have
a
waiver?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
might
have
a
waiver?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
yes.
as
the
opinions
are
particular
the
concurring
--
the
dissenting
opinions
in
brewer
indicate
that
wherever
question
is
always
a
close
question
in
cases
in
which
we
have
somebody
known
to
be
a
police
officer
that
seems
to
me
it's
always
a
very
easy
question.
you
can't
find
a
waiver
when
we've
got
an
undercover
informant.
now,
your
honors
i
had
wanted
to
take
a
bit
of
time
to
point
out
in
mr.
nichols'
testimony,
how
strongly
that
testimony
supports
particularly
judge
butzner's
concurring
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
thought
that's
what
i
was
here
for.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
any
government
any
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
any
information
obtained
by
a
government
agent
who
seeks
to
obtain
information
for
use
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
in
a
pending
trial.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
why
did
he
go
there?
if
he
went
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
--
to
obtain
information
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
in
your
bar
room
hypothetical?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
if
the
fbi
agent
went
there
to
get
a
drink
and
it
just
happened
that
mr.
henry
came
along
and
made
incriminatory
statements?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
in
my
position
is
that
is
not
a
violation
or
the
right
to
counsel.
the
government
had
not
done
anything
to
obtain
the
evidence
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i'd
must
have
confused
you
with
my
answer.
i
thought
that
was
the
same
as
the
warden.
what
are
we
saying
your
honors
if
we
look
at
page
135
of
the
transcript
question,
“did
mr.
henry
tell
you
anything
about
that
bank
robbery?”
now,
“tell”
means
we
got
a
conversation
between
the
two
about
the
bank
robbery.
perhaps,
it's
not
questioning,
but
it's
a
conversation.
“would
you
relate
to
the
jury
what
he
told
you?”
at
that
point
mr.
nichols'
tells
the
jury
the
substance
of
the
admissions
that
he
attributes
to
mr.
henry.
further
down
on
page
136
of
the
transcript,
the
question
to
mr.
nichols',
“did
he
give
you
any
reason
for
going
in
the
bank?”
people
give
reasons
for
doing
things
when
they
are
engaged
in
a
conversation
on
a
subject.
nowhere,
do
we
hear
questions
or
answers
in
which
mr.
nichols'
tells
us,
“i
overheard
henry
bragging
to
other
prisoners.”
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
your
honor
we
must
assume
that
mr.
(inaudible)
prepared
his
witness
and
that
he
knew
what
the
witnesses'
story
was
and
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
jury
accurately.
if
i
had
--
if
i
were
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
had
been
advised
by
the
fbi
agents
or
the
witness
that
what
this
man
was
a
listening
post,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
i
would've
asked
is
“did
you
ever
hear
anything
while
you're
in
the
cell
of
mr.
henry?”
we
don't
see
that
question
and
because
we
don't
see
that
i
think
we
can
assume
that
the
totally
of
the
record
reflects
the
facts
as
described
to
the
prosecutor
by
the
--
either
the
agents
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
case
does
not
completely
turn
on
that
but
if
the
court
cares
--
if
it
is
crucial
to
the
court's
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
overhearing
as
oppose
to
some
efforts
to
draw
the
defendant
act
out
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
supports
that
conclusion.
and
then
finally
we
have
on
page
137
again,
the
use
of
the
word
“described”
in
the
questions
and
answers
and
again
“tell,”
all
of
which
seems
to
leave
me
to
the
conclusion
that
although
we
believe
the
proper
reading
of
the
massiah
decision
of
the
two
pre
curiums
and
of
brewer
is
that
the
government
may
not
after
formal
adversary
proceedings
seek
to
obtain
information
from
the
accused
without
respecting
the
right
to
counsel
if
we
have
to
find
what's
tantamount
to
interrogation
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
of
a
jail
cell,
we
got
an
adequate
record
to
support
the
court
of
appeals
in
doing
so.
thank
you
your
honors.
