right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that's
what
you
did?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
massiah
didn't
require
interrogation?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
direct
yourself?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
interrogation
as
such
in
massiah
itself,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
wasn't
in
mcleod
against
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
another
summary
reversal
in
which
it
was
even
clear
that
there
was
not
interrogation,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
name,
brady?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
a
person
who's
been
indicted,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

under
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
suspect
but
somebody
who
was
been
indicted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
all
goes
back
to
the
concurring
opinions
in
spano
against
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
generally
follows
an
indictment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
our
system
of
the
administration
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
criminal
law
when
a
person
is
indicted
is
followed
by
formal
judicial
proceedings
in
an
open
courtroom,
there
are
all
sorts
of
constitutional
rights
to
counsel,
to
confrontation
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
it's
open
to
the
public
and
it's
presided
over
by
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
have
you
read
the
final
paragraph
in
the
spano
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
us
that
the
facts
in
the
massiah
case
can
be
gleaned
from
the
record
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeal
or
perhaps
in
the
trial
court
but
the
so
far
as
a
review
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
the
facts
in
the
massiah
case
were
no
more
nor
less
than
a
conversation
between
massiah
and
his
supposed
friend,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

that
car
which
have
been
wired
for
sound.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
--
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
so
far
as
the
facts
are
viewed
in
the
massiah
case
by
the
--
by
this
court,
there
wasn't
much
review
of
them,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
given
that
massiah
had
been
indicted
and
that
his
supposed
friend
was
in
fact
a
government
agent
and
if
the
government
agent
deliberately
elicited
or
acquired
information
from
massiah
sitting
on
the
front
seat
of
that
car
in
new
york
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
and
what's
--
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
geltner,
i
understand
there's
no
question
about
what
henry
had
been
indicted,
but
you
say
he'd
been
arraigned
and
counsel
had
been
appointed?
justice
potter
stewart
that
appears
somewhere
here?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
appendix
an
error?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
when
did
nichols
conversations
take
place,
sometime
between
the
15th

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter

justice
