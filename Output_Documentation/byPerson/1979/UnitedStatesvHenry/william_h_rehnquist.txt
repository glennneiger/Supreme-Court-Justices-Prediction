william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is
basically
a
question
of
fact
or
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
mean
in
a
technical
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
granted
summary
judgment
against
you,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
held
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
federal
habeas
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
that
latter
case
if
that's
all
he
did
and
then
informed
the
authorities
to
the
statements
that
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
had
made
then
he
wouldn't
been
in
government
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
third
party,
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
third
party
who
is
paid
by
the
government
and
a
third
party
who
is
just
another
convict
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
none
of
those
opinions
nor
any
other
case
from
this
court
has
ever
held
that
if
defendant
simply
blurts
out
to
the
warden
of
the
jail
in
which
he
is
confined,
i
want
to
get
this
out
of
my
chest,
i
want
to
tell
you
what
happened,
that
that's
inadmissible,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
courtroom
isn't
always
open
to
the
public
of
course,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
have
been
questions
used
and
certainly
low
languages
drawn
out
elicited,
interrogated,
do
you
conceive
those
to
be
just
use
in
their
ordinary
dictionary
sense
of
the
word
or
do
you
conceive
them
to
be
words
of
our
representing
various
places
along
the
spectrum
that
you
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
word
in
massiah
i
gather?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geltner,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
referring
to
a
statement
you
made
a
couple
moments
ago
that
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should've
remanded
for
another
hearing
after
the
district
court
treated
them
the
first
remand
the
way
it
did.
you're
not
suggesting
here
that
the
present
decision
under
review
remanded
the
habeas
petition
for
another
hearing,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
assumed
then
all
resolved
doubts
in
favor
of
the
government
and
nonetheless
set
the
conviction
aside.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geltner
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
this
spectrum
that
mr.
frey
has
referred
to?
would
you
think
that
a
person
who
is
under
indictment
and
in
jail
volunteering
a
confession
to
the
warden
is
a
violation
of
massiah?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
a
totally
voluntary
confession
in
effect
to
someone
in
the
employ
of
the
government
does
not
violate
massiah?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unconnected
with
the
case,
i
don't
know
exactly
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
very
factual
inquiry,
isn't
it
as
to
the
intent
with
which
the
government
employee
approaches
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
he
concurred
in
judge
winter's
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
--
mr.
geltner,
you
say
that
the
record
would've
supported
a
narrower
opinion
in
effect
than
in
the
court
of
appeals'
wrote
i
take
it
because
on
page
7
(a)
of
the
petition
the
language
you
have
been
referring
judge
winter's
opinion,
he
says,
“even
if
we
assumed
that
nichols
obeyed
his
instructions
and
not
to
interrogate
henry
about
the
bank
robbery,
he
did
testify
he
engaged
in
conversation
so
that
they
certainly
don't
go
much
beyond
purely
passive
listening
to
find
a
violation
that
massiah
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
you
overseen
transcripts
of
your
own
examination
witnesses
and
realize
that
colloquial
expressions
are
frequently
used
in
what
eliciting
testimony
at
trials?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
case
turns
on
the
use
of
the
word
“tell”
as
opposed
to
overhear
by
the
prosecutor
in
examining
a
witness
on
direct?
