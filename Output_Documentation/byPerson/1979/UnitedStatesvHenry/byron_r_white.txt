justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
the
holding,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
interrogation,
by
interrogation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
--
is
there
something
--
is
there
any
case,
i
guess
if
there
were
a
case
we
wouldn't
be
here,
saying
that
no
violation
if
no
interrogation?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
legal
stoolie.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
he
drawn
out
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
was
drawn
out,
was
that
interrogation
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
brewer
was
interrogated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
a
quote
from
massiah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
a
cellmate
who
isn't
a
government
agent
at
the
time
interrogates
or
finds
out
then
as
it
turns
out
his
quite
willing
to
testify
for
the
government
because
he
knows
that
people
who
knew
get
a
break
but
he
was
never
put
there
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
perhaps,
to
be
the
policy
of
this
prison
and
this
warden
and
this
government
that
people
who
--
people
who
do
as
a
favor
and
get
down
a
favor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
word
is
just
seeps
through
the
wall.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
suppose
if
the
government
agent
who
is
put
in
the
cell
if
he
was
a
mute
he
couldn't
speak,
okay,
he
could
just
listen,
i
suppose
you're
be
still
making
your
argument
because
he
was
put
there
to
elicit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
different
believes
whether
he
said
a
word
or
interrogated
anybody
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
submission
that
just
passive
listening
by
the
agent
would've
--
would
violate
the
right
to
counsel,
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think,
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
answer
it
to
my
question
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
do
you
think
this
--
so
you
think
they
said
there's
a
violation
here
because
passive
listening
would
violate
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
said
that,
i'm
not
sure
they
went
on
and
answered
the
question
that
you
brought
to
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
agreeing
with
you
that
passive
listening
is
enough
by
an
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
no
different
if
the
agent
in
this
case,
the
cellmate
had
said
to
him
by
the
way
whether
you
ignored
or
not
i'm
a
government
agent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
if
all
the
agent
there,
if
all
the
cellmate
ever
said
is,
“by
the
way
government
has
asked
me
to
report
very
thing
(inaudible)
and
asked
me
to
report
and
i
promise
report
everything
ever
say”
and
that
then
he
just
shuts
up
he
never
says
another
word
and
the
other
fellow
sooner
or
later
tells
him
something
that's
incriminating.
justice
byron
r.
white
might
have
(voice
overlap)
a
waiver
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
except
for
that
would
be
the
same.
except
for
that
you'd
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
really
going
to
try
to
win
the
case
now?
[laughter]
