justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dickens,
before
you
start
i
am
interested
in
the
same
subject
that
mr.
stevens
has
been
pursuing,
the
risk
of
duplicative
litigation.
the
government's
brief
says
on
page
35
at
the
top
that
the
risk
of
duplicating
litigation
can
be
minimized
by
the
exercise
of
the
district
court's
equitable
powers
under
706(g).
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
like
to
hear
you
discuss
that,
and
you
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
your
brief.
what
has
been
the
actual
experience?
