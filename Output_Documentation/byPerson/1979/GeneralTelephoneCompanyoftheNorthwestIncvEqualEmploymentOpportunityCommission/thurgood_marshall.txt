justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
of
the
same
class
as
the
eeoc?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
a
class
action
theory
require
that
they
all
have
the
same
claim?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
class
action
require
that
all
members
of
the
class
stand
on
the
same
footing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
who
is
on
the
same
level
as
the
eeoc?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
on
the
same
level
as
the
eeoc?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
up
to
congress
to
decide
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
gave
them
the
right,
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
they
have
to
go
further?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
have
to
go
further?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
have
to.
i
didn't
say
did
or
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
clearly
superseded
by
congress.
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
gave
eeoc
the
right
to
bring
this
action
on
behalf
of
these
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
didn't
say
class
action.
you
said
it
should
have
said
pursuant
to
rule
23?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
think
congress
should
have
said?
or
do
you
say
that
congress
should
have
said
anything,
that
congress
intended
rule
23
to
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
congress
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
other
federal
courts
is
determined
by
guess
who?
justice
thurgood
marshall
day
by
day
by
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
congress
had
that
power.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
they
had
the
power
to
decide
what
jurisdiction
this
court
had.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
say
that
the
federal
courts
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
actions
by
the
eeoc
on
behalf
of
people,
period,
and
that
is
what
the
federal
government
did.
now
you
say
you
have
to
add
on
to
that
rule
23.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
average
citizen
file
a
case
who
is
a
member
of
the
class
without
making
it
a
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
they
are
doing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
they
have
a
right
to
do
under
the
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
dickens,
on
just
one
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
be
that
at
a
later
stage
in
this
proceeding
you
could
raise
this
same
point,
this
class
action
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
when
it
begins
to
hurt
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right,
or
some
person
already
in
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wallace
as
i
understand
your
position,
even
if
they
grant
you
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
name
of
the
eeoc
and
even
if
you
have
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
name
of
the
eeoc
on
behalf
of
the
for
name
complainer,
you
don't
have
the
right
to
also
ask
for
relief
for
the
whole
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
dickens,
what
you
do
if
one
of
these
women
filed
suit
on
her
own?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
not
as
a
class
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
turn
it
into
a
class
action,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
then
you
could
have
as
many
suits
as
you
had
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
consider
this
as
incidental
to
the
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
some
cases
to
back
it
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
they
say
they
are
suing
for
the
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
they
are
suing
pursuant
to
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
they
say
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
think
they
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
maybe
not,
they
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
this
enlarge
group
of
people,
would
that
have
been
a
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
giving
too
much
weight
to
the
word
"class"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
caught
them
using
it,
so
you
are
going
to
lay
it
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
caught
them
using
the
word
"class"
so
you
are
going
to
get
the
most
out
of
it.
