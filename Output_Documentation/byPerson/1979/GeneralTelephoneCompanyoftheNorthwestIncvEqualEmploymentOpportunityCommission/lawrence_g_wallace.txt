mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
outside
of
the
context
of
title
vii,
no
court
has
ever
held
that
a
suit
by
the
united
states
or
one
of
agencies
to
enforce
federal
law
must
proceed
as
a
class
action
its
behalf
of
the
affected
members
of
the
public
even
though
there
are
many
contexts
in
which
such
suits
arise,
and
the
contrary
practice
has
been
common
place.
we
reviewed
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
this
court's
decision
in
porter
v.
warner
holding
company
which
involved
the
rent
control
legislation
of
the
world
war
ii
era.
back
pay
cases
are
common
under
the
national
labor
relations
act;
actions
to
recover
on
behalf
of
an
affected
group
of
employees
are
common
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
statutory
authority,
that
is
correct,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
actually
there
was
not
in
porter
v.
warner
holding
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
wasn't
express
statutory
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
equitable
power
of
the
court
to
award
the
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
haven't
really
faced
that
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
situations
where
the
united
states
represents
individuals
and
is
a
lawyer
for
individuals
under
the
veterans
reemployment
law
or
in
cases
where
there
is
a
state
taxation
of
servicemen,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
united
states
could
not
move
under
rule
23
in
those
circumstances,
if
it
saw
fit
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
really
is
functioning
as
counsel
for
named
persons.
it
is
not
suing
in
its
own
name
under
those
statutes.
when
the
cases
reach
this
court
the
name
of
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
the
united
states
is
serving
as
counsel
for
individuals
that
it
is
authorized
by
statute
to
represent
to
court
in
those
situations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
situation
for
example
where
we
decide
not
to
petition
for
certiorari
we
typically
notify
then
that
they
have
thier
right
to
hire
their
own
councel
and
do
so
if
they
want
to
proceed
with
the
case
and
though
we
have
determined
that
we
will
not
go
ahead
with
it
the
case
is
really
thier
case
under
those
statutes.
it
is
quite
different
from
the
kind
of
situation
here
where
congress
has
authorized
to
to
courts
on
or
the
attorney
general
to
sue
in
their
own
capacity
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless
we
tend
to
comply
with
--
we
meet
the
standards
of
rule
23,
i
believe
that
it
is
their
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
most
of
that
we
will
have
to
await
tomorrow
but
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
court
rose
yesterday,
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
what
would
be
wrong
with
our
having
to
comply
with
rule
23
in
suits
in
which
make
whole
relief
is
sought
as
well
as
injunctive
relief.
basically
there
would
be
three
things
that
would
be
wrong
with
this.
they
are
somewhat
interrelated.
the
first
is
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
so
sharp
a
change
from
the
traditional
practice
in
suits
by
the
government
or
its
agencies.
not
only
was
congress
presumably
familiar
with
the
pattern
of
government
litigation
under
many
other
statutes,
but
there
had
indeed
been
69
suits
filed
by
the
attorney
general
between
1964
and
1972
under
section
707
of
this
act,
some
of
which
had
sought
relief
that
would
benefit
a
class
of
persons
such
as
preferential
hiring
order,
constructive
seniority
and
the
like,
and
in
none
of
those
cases
had
it
ever
been
suggested
by
anyone
that
rule
23
procedures
need
be
used
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
none
of
them
up
until
1972
did,
although
some
decided
shortly
thereafter
did
include
claims
for
monetary
relief.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
newly
authorized
governmental
suits
under
section
706
were
to
be
assimilated
to
the
section
707
suits
to
the
point
where
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
said
section
707
would
essentially
become
a
redundancy
in
the
law
and
that
everything
could
be
accomplished
under
section
706
that
previously
could
be
accomplished
only
under
section
707.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
providing
the
pattern
of
practice
criterion
could
be
met
which
is
required
to
bring
a
707
suit
and
get
relief,
which
is
not
required
under
706.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
except
for
that
quality,
as
far
as
we
can
see
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
government
to
be
able
to
sue
under
706
as
well
as
707?
apparently
it
was
the
idea
that
the
commission
would
become
the
primary
enforcement
mechanism
and
that
there
would
be
--
that
the
law
would
be
enforced
primarily
by
governmental
suits
rather
than
private
suits
and
that
the
government
should
not
have
to
sue
only
in
pattern
or
practice
cases.
even
though
if
one
takes
a
generous
enough
view
of
pattern
or
practice,
most
cases
could
be
sit
into
the
pattern
or
practice
terminology,
but
not
all
cases.
that
seemed
to
be
the
predominant
thinking.
i
think
it
was
really
part
of
the
compromise
between
those
who
thought
that
the
commission
should
have
the
cease
and
desist
authority
and
those
who
thought
that
court
enforcement
should
continue
to
be
the
method
of
enforcement,
but
that
the
commission
would
have
the
responsibility
of
bringing
most
of
the
court
cases.
the
second
thing
that
would
be
wrong
with
this,
and
this
cuts
it
seems
to
me
a
little
more
deeply
into
the
case,
is
that
it
would
cast
the
government
in
an
inappropriate
role
in
enforcement
of
the
statute,
and
in
some
ways
this
is
among
the
most
important
things
about
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case,
the
role
to
be
envisioned
for
the
government
in
the
enforcement
of
title
vii.
the
commission
and
the
attorney
general
have
never
understood
that
role
to
be
the
role
of
a
proxy
for
individual
complainants
or
for
any
particular
class
of
persons,
and
there
is
no
lawyer-client
relationship
established
with
any
particular
group
of
persons
as
there
is
in
the
statutes
that
we
discussed
yesterday,
where
possibly
the
government
could
bring
a
class
action
where
it
is
serving
as
a
lawyer
for
particular
individuals.
the
commission's
assignment
and
the
attorney
general's
assignment
in
the
cases
that
they
are
to
bring
or
he
is
to
bring
is
to
enforce
the
law
rather
than
to
act
on
behalf
of
any
individuals.
this
is
indicated
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
which
is
section
706
is
set
forth
on
page
a34
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
it
starts
off
saying
the
commission
is
empowered
as
hereafter
provided
to
prevent
any
person
from
engaging
in
any
unlawful
employment
practice
as
set
forth
in
the
other
provisions,
not
to
represent
any
group
of
individuals,
and
there
are
other
references
that
are
consistent
with
this
view
of
the
government's
role
in
enforcement.
i
want
to
refer
to
only
one
of
them.
on
page
a-37,
in
section
(f)(l)
there,
it
says,
"if
within
thirty
days,"
et
cetera,
"the
commission
has
been
unable
to
secure
from
the
respondent
a
conciliation
agreement
acceptable
to
the
commission,
the
commission
may
bring
a
civil
action"
the
responsibility
is
to
see
to
it
that
the
law
is
enforced.
if
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
the
agreement
properly
implements
the
law,
there
is
no
obligation
to
any
particular
group
or
class
of
persons
to
make
sure
that
they
are
satisfied.
of
course,
if
they
won't
agree
to
the
agreement,
there
might
be
litigation
in
any
event,
but
the
commission
would
not
have
the
responsibility
to
conduct
that
litigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
really
a
similar
responsibility
to
enforce
the
law.
it
happens
that
in
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
never
have.
they
never
have
had
to.
it
has
always
been,
the
practice
has
always
been
that
they
have
statutory
authority
to
seek
the
relief
for
--
to
see
to
it
that
the
law
is
complied
with
and
that
those
who
have
been
denied
proper
wages
are
made
whole.
it
is
part
of
the
statutory
authority.
there
never
has
been
the
use
of
rule
23
in
those
cases.
those
cases
don't
present
some
of
the
complexities
and
considerations
and
the
possibilities
for
divergence
of
the
public
interest
from
private
interests
that
are
involved
in
title
vii.
the
standards
are
very
clear
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
it
is
almost
once
you've
done
your
factual
investigation,
it
is
almost
a
mathematical
exercise.
title
vii
is
very
different
from
that.
even
if
one
takes
a
rather
one-sided
view
of
the
government's
enforcement
responsibilities,
if
you
pose
an
example
of
getting
rightful
place
seniority
relief
under
this
court's
decision
in
franks
v.
bowman
transportation
company,
for
example,
the
question
is
who
is
entitled
to
that
rigthful
place
in
seniority
relief
in
many
situations,
what
classes
of
employees.
if
it
can
be
secured
only
for
a
particular
racial
group,
that
is
more
advantageous
to
the
members
of
that
class
than
if
it
is
broadened
to
include
other
ethnic
or
gender
groups.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
isn't
broadened
to
include
these
other
groups,
they
are
being
disadvantaged
by
the
granting
of
it
to
the
first
group.
there
are
strains
here,
there
are
possibilities
of
competition
among
claimants
so
that
the
commission
would
be
embarked
on
a
treacherous
course
if
it
thought
of
its
role
as
anything
other
than
seeing
to
it
that
the
law
is
properly
enforced.
if
it
thought
of
itself
as
to
be
cast
in
the
role
of
a
representative
for
any
particular
group
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
make
whole
relief
and
part
of
what
the
legislative
history
reflected
was
that
the
commission
was
to
be
able
to
get
broader
based
relief
and
more
comprehensive
relief,
similar
to
the
relief
that
had
been
secured
in
class
actions
brought
by
private
individuals
theretofore
under
section
706,
even
though
for
other
purposes
the
action
by
the
commission
or
the
attorney
general
was
to
be
assimilated
to
the
familiar
kind
of
action
under
707.
the
example
that
i
have
given
is
really
two
one-dimensional
examples
because
title
vii
protects
the
rights
of
all
persons
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
their
race
and
their
sex
or
their
sex
or
the
other
classifications,
and
while
the
commission,
the
united
states
are
of
course
committed
to
an
effective
enforcement
policy
of
putting
an
end
to
discrimination
wherever
it
is
found,
to
finding
effective
remedies
to
make
whole
the
victims
of
discrimination
and
to
prevent
its
reoccurrence.
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
sometimes
remedies
can
be
excessive.
sometimes
this
court
has
found
remedies
that
we
have
contended
for
to
be
excessive,
and
they
can
in
extreme
cases
become
an
instrument
that
treats
other
unfairly,
an
instrument
of
discrimination
in
themselves.
and
when
the
united
states
or
the
commission
brings
its
weight
and
its
resources
into
the
enforcement
of
this
law,
it
must
be
with
an
awareness
of
all
of
the
rights
that
will
be
affected,
including
other
rights
that
were
respected
under
title
vii,
collective
bargaining
rights,
managerial
prerogatives,
and
the
like.
it
must
not
approach
these
cases
with
a
one-dimensional
view
that
it
is
serving
only
as
a
representative
of
a
particular
class
of
individuals.
that
to
us
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
and
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
way
congress
expected
governmental
authorities
to
carry
out
their
responsibilities
under
this
statute,
just
as
they
do
under
any
other
statute.
it
is
a
law
enforcement
responsibility.
and
this
element
of
detachment
of
the
commission
or
of
the
attorney
general
from
the
particular
interests
involved
is
reflected
in
many
details
of
practice
under
the
act.
the
commission
need
not
include
all
of
the
issues
raised
by
a
charging
party
in
its
suit,
if
it
concludes
that
some
of
them
are
without
merit,
and
it
is
not
limited
to
the
issues
raised
by
the
charging
party
or
even
to
the
interests
that
the
charging
party
represents
because
the
failure
to
include
the
interests
of
others
found
to
be
victims
of
this
discrimination
might
result
in
the
suit
working
to
their
detriment
in
some
circumstances
actually,
and
the
commission's
responsibility
is
to
enforce
the
law
in
a
more
comprehensive
manner.
moreover,
the
charging
party
is
not
bound
when
the
commission
thinks
there
is
no
merit
in
the
charge
at
all
and
refuses
to
bring
suit.
the
charging
party
can
still
bring
a
suit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
haven't
gotten
to
it
yet.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
second
one
ran
out
and
--
the
third
reason,
mr.
justice,
is
that
rule
23
doesn't
fit
the
situation
as
the
terms
of
rule
23
are
ordinarily
understood.
the
rule
would
really
have
to
be
distorted
considerably
to
be
applied
here.
the
commission
is
not
an
employee
of
general
telephone
company
of
the
northwest,
nor
is
it
an
association
of
such
employees.
it
is
not
controlled
by
those
employees.
it
is
not
bound
to
represent
their
interests
in
any
way.
its
responsibilities,
its
claims
in
this
case
are
not
typical
of
any
class.
and
in
light
of
its
law
enforcement
responsibilities
and
responsibilities
to
other
categories
of
the
public,
there
are
difficulties
in
saying
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
if
one
thing
emerges
with
clarity
from
the
legislative
history
it
is
that
congress
intended
that
in
actions
by
the
commission
and
by
the
attorney
general,
all
of
the
relief
that
had
heretofore
been
available
in
class
actions
by
individuals
would
be
available.
the
whole
effort
in
1972
was
to
make
enforcement
more
effective
and
to
make
the
commission
and
the
attorney
general
the
primary
enforcement
mechanism.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
without
having
to
comply
with
rule
23,
and
that
is
exactly
the
analogy
we
think
is
here
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
neither
do
we.
it
is
only
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
has
called
it
a
class
action
and
said
that
we
have
to
comply
with
rule
23.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
there
can
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation
stimulated
by
the
question
of
whether
rule
23
has
been
complied
with.
as
the
court
is
familiar
with
its
own
cases,
there
can
be
a
great
deal
that
is
another
layer
of
litigation
added
to
these
cases
if
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
considerable
difficulty
seeing
how
it
would
operate.
as
far
as
we
are
aware,
no
one
is
bound
in
the
first
place.
part
of
the
contention
being
made
here
is
that
all
individuals
should
be
bound,
and
that
is
the
reason
to
make
it
a
class
action,
but
that
in
itself
seems
to
us
inconsistent
with
the
way
congress
has
set
up
the
statute.
as
i
just
mentioned,
no
one
is
bound
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
decides
that
there
is
no
merit
at
all
in
their
claim,
why
should
they
be
bound
by
a
sattlement
of
the
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
as
usual
as
it
seems,
putting
it
that
way.
it
is
something
very
similar
to
the
antitrust
laws.
if
the
government
wins
an
antitrust
lawsuit
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
exactly
the
situation
here,
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
you
can
get
the
relief
here
as
you
would
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
no
because
the
government
has
lost
its
case.
they
can
still
bring
a
suit
on
their
own
for
the
same
alleged
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
is
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
they
can.
they
are
free
to.
it
just
doesn't
happen
very
often
and
we
haven't
found
it
happening
very
often
here.
one
of
the
most
effective
things
is
if
the
government
prevails
then
people
can
be
required
to
waive
any
further
claim
in
accepting
the
benefits
of
the
judgment
that
the
government
does
get
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
court
said
is
the
way
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
attempted
to
bring
them
in
the
fifth
circuit
since
the
d.
h.
holmes
decision.
it
is
not
an
easy
matter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
not
take
that
position.
if
in
order
to
get
the
relief
that
congress
contemplated
in
the
1972
act
we
had
to
proceed
under
rule
23
and
had
no
other
option
under
this
court's
decision,
we
would
proceed
under
rule
23
as-best
we
could.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
that
it
would
be
inappropriate,
but
i
wouldn't
take
the
position
that
it
cannot
because
if
we
are
forced
to
in
order
to
effectuate
the
congressional
policy
that
the
commission
get
this
relief
as
the
primary
enforcement
tool,
we
will
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
think
the
force
of
our
argument
disappears.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
only
saying
that
if
we
are
required
to
we
will
try
to
proceed
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
many
difficulties
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
we
are
not
required
to
and
that
it
is
inappropriate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
we
can
go
that
far,
mr.
justice,
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
comply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
see
great
difficulty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
been
trying
to
do
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
stand
here
and
say
that
our
position
is
we
can't.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
and
we
will
certainly
discontinue
that
practice
should
this
court
agree
with
our
position.
we
do
think
it
is
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
are
trying
to.
we
don't
fit
very
well
into
any
of
the
provisions
of
rule
23.
an
amicus
supporting
us
in
this
court
argues
that
we
can't
be
a
proper
representative
of
them.
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
class
of
claimants
could
feel
uncomfortable
with
us
as
their
representative
in
a
class
action.
for
one
thing,
our
position
in
title
vii
litigation
can't
be
unaffected
by
the
fact
that
the
government
is
often
a
defendant
in
title
vii
suits.
the
commission
does
have
responsibility
to
enforce
title
vii
within
the
government.
the
solicitor
general
has
a
responsibility
to
defend
the
government
in
such
cases
before
this
court.
our
attitude
about
the
use
of
civil
service
examinations
in
the
states
has
to
be
affected
by
the
similarity
of
the
use
of
civil
service
examinations
in
the
federal
government
and
the
fact
that
many
of
these
examinations
have
been
developed
with
help
from
the
federal
government.
we
may
have
reason
to
think
that
congress
approves
of
the
merit
system
of
employment
and
would
want
title
vii
reconciled
with
that
approach
to
governmental
employment,
but
there
are
people
who
disagree
with
us
on
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
there
is
a
practice
to
give
comprehensive
notice.
very
often
the
word
gets
around
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
the
charging
party
would
involved
in
civil
rights
organizations,
but
there
is
not
a
systematic
notice
given
to
all
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
as
we
understand
it,
there
is
no
notice
requirement
when
injunctive
relief
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
will
create
a
burden
on
the
litigation
itself.
it
will
encumber
title
vii
litigation
with
a
lot
of
issues
about
adequacy
of
representation
typicality,
whether
you
are
really
a
become
bones
of
contention
in
the
litigation.
it
will
hobble
effective
enforcement
of
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
could
be
contentions
about
adequacy
of
representation,
but
not
made
by
the
defendant
ordinarily
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
really
an
amendment
of
rule
23,
of
changing
what
the
criteria
would
ordinarily
mean.
and
if
the
court
were
to
say
that,
it
wouldn't
be
a
meaningful
thing
to
call
it
a
rule
23
suit.
it
wouldn't
be
like
other
rule
of
attorney
suits
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
might
make
it
easier
for
the
commission
to
negotiate
settlements
if
they
could
represent
that
everyone
will
be
bound
by
them.
but
we
recognize
that
but
we
don't
think
that
that
is
the
role
that
congress
assigned
to
the
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
that
there
is
reason
enough
that
people
should
be
bound
or
that
the
difficulties
as
a
practical
matter
are
such
that
the
law
should
be
stretched
in
this
direction.
we
have
mentioned
in
the
last
two
or
three
pages
of
our
brief
why
as
a
practical
matter
duplication
of
litigation
is
unlikely
to
occur,
certainly
because
all
the
relief
is
equitable
in
nature
and
there
won't
be
double
remedies
of
any
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you.
