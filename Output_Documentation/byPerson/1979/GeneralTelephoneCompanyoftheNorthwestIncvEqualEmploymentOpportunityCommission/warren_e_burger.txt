they
were
all
members
of
the
agency,

it
was
a
quasi-public
trade
agency,
it
was
a
trade
agency
with
legislative
status,
was
it
not?

less

ten
left.
chief

so
you

reserve

e.

we
will
resume
argument
in
79-488,
general

mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
would
the
opting
out
process
go,
applying
rule
23
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
said
something
about
that
may
bear
on
this,
i'm
not
sure,
in
the
roper
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
the
effect
that
the
tender
and
the
payment
of
the
full
amount
due
and
interest,
all
the
relief,
all
the
monetary
relief
initially
sought
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
in
a
class
action.
i
am
not
sure
how
that
would
ultimately
filter
its
way
into
this
setting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
if
a
lawyer
who
is
presumed
to
know
about
rule
23
class
actions
was
the
word
"class
action"
when
he
is
representing
a
large
group
of
people
that
he
means
a
class
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
