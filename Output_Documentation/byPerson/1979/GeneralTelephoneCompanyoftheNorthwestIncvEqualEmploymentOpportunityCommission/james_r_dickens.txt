mr.
james
r.
dickens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
james
dickens,
of
karr,
tuttle,
koch,
campbell,
mawer
&
morrow,
in
seattle,
and
i
represent
general
telephone,
the
petitioner
herein.
we
have
a
very
narrow
procedural
question
before
the
court.
it
is
very
simple.
when
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
brings
a
class
action
under
section
706(f)(1)
of
the
civil
rights
act,
does
it
have
to
comply
with
rule
23,
and
we
believe
it
requires
a
very
short
answer
and
that
is
yes.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
the
government
has
not
in
the
prayer
or
in
the
complaint
said
that
it
is
a
class
action,
but
by
the
scope
of
the
complaint
and
the
relief
requested,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
class
action.
they
moved
at
the
trial
court
level
to
bifurcate
the
issue
of
class
liability
from
the
issue
of
individual
damages.
we
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
and
they
acknowledge
that
they
were
seeking
relief
for
a
class
and
that
is
what
they
are.
we
believe
this
is
the
way
the
statutory
procedure
is
set
up,
they
are
seeking
relief
on
behalf
of
an
individual
plus
on
behalf
of
the
class.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
that
is
where
we
believe
that
what
congress
has
done
in
accordance
with
its
power
to
supersede
the
federal
rules
in
whole
or
in
part,
it
has
declared
that
the
commission
is
a
properly
suing
party
and
therefore
to
that
extent
they
have
superseded
the
requirement
of
rule
23(a)
that
it
be
a
member
of
the
class.
as
a
consequence
by
statute
we
believe
and
we
contend
that
congress
has
made
the
commission
a
properly
suing
party
under
rule
23.
having
taken
that
step,
they
are
a
properly
suing
party,
it
is
the
same
as
the
court
has
held,
for
example,
in
hunt
v.
washington
state
apple
commission,
associations,
state
agencies
and
so
forth
do
have
standing
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
a
class,
even
if
technically
they
are
not
a
member
of
the
class.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
the
other
members
of
the
class,
that
would
depend
on
two
things.
first
of
all,
we
look
to
the
charging
parties.
we
have
four
charging
parties
here.
they
are
four
women
employees
at
one
facility
out
of
116
in
one
state
out
of
five.
now
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
i
didn't
say
that.
there
have
been
cases
in
the
lower
court
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
substantially
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
as
a
typicality
requirement.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
first
of
all
the
eeoc
is
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
the
eeoc
is
on
a
level
by
itself.
it
is
on
the
level
with
the
charging
parties.
that
is
our
position,
that
the
typicality
requirement,
you
look
to
the
charging
parties.
the
eeoc
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
we
believe
that
is
correct
in
the
sense
that
it
stands
in
their
shoes.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
the
statute
itself,
as
the
court
is
aware,
doesn't
refer
to
this
way
or
the
other
in
the
sense
of
is
the
standing
the
same
or
otherwise.
we
only
have,
as
we
had
--
and
i
know
the
court
has
talked
about
this
earlier
today
--
the
congressional
history
kept
referring
to
cease
and
desist
approach
versus
court
enforcement
approach
and
should
we
follow
the
normal
rules
of
procedures.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
unique
phrasing
of
the
statute
and
in
that
situation
you
normally
have
authority
on
behalf
of
the
administrator
to
bring
and
file
suit
on
behalf
of
the
government
itself
and
you
usually
have
questions
of
what
is
the
relief.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
relief.
we
are
talking
about
the
procedure,
a
procedure
which
is
solely
triggered
in
each
case
by
the
individual
charging
party.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
the
united
states
can
bring
an
action
in
its
own
name
for
its
own
injury,
but
when
it
brings
suit
in
a
normal
civil
or
criminal
case
it
doesn't
usually
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
other
private
individuals
who
have
been
injured
and
seek
to
bind
the
defendant
to
those
individuals
if
it
wins
but
not
have
them
bound
if
it
loses.
that
is
a
critical
distinction
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
the
government
says
if
you
lose,
employer,
you
are
bound
to
the
class
but
if
you
are
saying
that
in
this
case
we
have
the
same
procedure
either
for
a
private
litigant
or
for
the
government
under
section
706(f)
is
you
trigger
with
the
private
individual,
you
investigate,
determination,
the
commission
says
either
we
will
let
you
sue
or
we
will
sue,
if
the
individual
sues
the
government
admits,
rule
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
in
hunt
that
was
a
question
of
standing
with
regard
to
a
state
agency,
the
washington
state
apple
commission,
and
the
question
was
standing
by
it
as
a
state
agency
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
various
growers
in
the
state
and
this
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor.
they
had
some
effect
to
the
extent
that
they
helped
select
the
people
who
were
on
the
agency,
but
it
was
not
a
private
organization.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
i
don't
deny
that,
it
was
and
that
was
part
of
the
approach
but
the
court
did
say,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
having
written
the
opinion,
that
it
was
a
state
agency
and
there
was
standing
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
the
group.
we
are
not
questioning
the
standing
of
the
commission
to
bring
suit.
we
are
saying
that
the
commission
can
bring
suit
and
we
are
not
questioning
at
this
time,
it
is
not
a
question
as
to
the
scope
of
what
they
can
do.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
when
the
commission
brings
suit
and
says,
well,
we
will
bring
it
instead
of
you,
charging
party,
and
we
know
you
would
have
to
comply
with
it,
we
want
the
same
relief,
we
say
they
should
comply
with
rule
23
also.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
i
am
not
denying
they
have
a
right
to
sue.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor,
they
did,
if
they
were
going
to
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
i
said
they
did.
they
would
have
had
to
go
further
to
exempt
the
commission
from
rule
23.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
because
the
general
rule
is
that
the
rules
apply
to
all
civil
actions
unless
otherwise
exempted
or
unless
clearly
superseded
by
congress.
rule
1
says
it
applies.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
if
congress
did
not
intend
rule
23
to
apply,
they
should
have
said
so.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
because
that
is
the
general
rule.
this
court
and
congress
have
promulgated
the
federal
rules.
they
have
said
in
rule
1
that
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
authority
also
under
its
power
in
the
statute
to
assist,
too.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
well,
it
is
determined
by
the
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
by
this
court,
your
honor,
and
by
congress.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
they
do
also.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
rule
23
applies.
they
also
did
not
mention
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
if
he
only
seeks
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not,
they
are
seeking
class
relief,
that
is
where
we
have
the
problem.
if
they
only
sought
relief
for
the
four
charging
parties,
we
have
no
problem,
but
they
are
seeking
class
right
relief
without
the
following
of
the
general
rule
that
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
you
have
a
right
to
file
the
action.
if
they
file
the
action
the
private
party
files
the
action
and
want
to
make
it
a
class
action,
rule
23
applies.
let
me
just
briefly
give
the
court
a
little
flavor
for
the
facts.
we
mentioned
some
of
them.
we
had
four
women
employees
in
the
beaverton,
oregon
facility
file
charges.
that
is
one
facility
out
of
116
and
that
is
in
one
state
out
of
five
that
general
telephone
operates
in.
the
commission
investigated
and
when
it
concluded
it
wanted
to
file
a
broad-based
action
and
the
action
is
as
broad
as
possible.
it
mentions
no
specifics,
no
dates,
no
individuals,
and
requests
injunction,
affirmative
action,
it
requests
that
people
be
made
whole
who
are
adversely
affected,
and
request
back
pay.
we
are
not
in
this
case
questioning
the
scope
of
relief
that
can
be
granted.
all
we
are
trying
to
do
quite
frankly
is
avoid
litigating
this
case
now,
in
the
future,
and
in
the
future.
i
would
think
--
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
out
our
way
doesn't
want
to
try
the
case
two
or
three
times.
but
if
the
class
is
not
bound
by
any
decision
that
is
reached,
they
can
relitigate.
furthermore,
this
court
has
continued
to
say,
in
talking
about
title
vii
cases,
two
principles
which
we
contend
are
very
applicable
here.
first
of
all,
under
title
vii
it
is
the
courts
that
are
the
final
authority
on
title
vii
and
how
it
is
implemented,
and
we
agree.
secondly,
this
court
said
in
rodriguez
that
the
adherence
to
rule
23
is
indispensable
--
the
requirements
of
rule
23.
we
agree,
and
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do.
now,
here
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
for
example.
i
will
give
the
court
i
think
a
very
concrete
example
of
where
in
this
situation
the
commission
is
making
decisions
that
congress
intended
the
courts
to
make.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
question
that
because
you
allege
something
to
be
a
class
action,
that
does
not
make
it
a
class
action.
we
have
good
class
action
allegations
and
we
have
poor
class
actions.
in
this
case,
however,
the
commission
has
usurped
the
authority
of
the
court
in
the
class
certification
area
by,
number
one,
it
said
this
is
a
class
action.
that
is
normally
a
determination
court
makes.
and
number
two,
it
said
the
scope
of
the
class
is
this
broad.
now,
we
contend
that
those
are
requirements
that
congress
intended
the
courts
have
in
making
that
determination.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
think
that
depends
upon
the
type
of
class
action
that
is
certified,
whether
it
is
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
think
that
notice
of
some
type
will
have
to
be
given.
now,
whether
it
is
an
opt-in,
opt-out,
that
depends
on
how
the
court
decides
to
approach
it.
it
probably
would
be
an
opt-out
type
notice
that
a
class
action
is
pending
and
you
may
opt
out
if
you
do
not
desire
to
be
bound.
that
is
the
normal
situation
i
believe
in
this
case.
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
settlement,
your
honor,
that
is
really
a
big
problem
quite
frankly.
they
say
let's
settle
and
i
say,
well,
i
can't
settle
with
you,
some
good
plaintiff's
lawyer
is
going
to
tell
me,
hey,
that's
a
great
settlement,
let's
file
a
new
action
on
behalf
of
these
people
that
settled
and
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
they
are
not
bound,
your
honor.
the
class
members
aren't
bound.
we
have
a
settlement,
it
doesn't
bind
the
class
member.
it
binds
the
employer.
once
again,
it
is
the
same
thing
with
a
judgment.
we
are
bound
if
we
lose,
we
are
bound
if
we
settle.
the
class
members,
they
can
either
take
it
or
they
can
go
their
own
merry
way
and
either
bring
a
separate
action
or
whatever.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
act
not
so
much
under
706
but
there
can
be
a
distinction,
a
dichotomy
between
injunctive
relief
prospectively
and
the
situation
where
you
are
seeking
individual
may
call
relief
under
706.
it
is
in
the
latter
situation
where
you
are
seeking
to
give
back
pay,
you
are
seeking
a
seniority
spot
or
slot,
that
is
where
i
believe
we
should
bind
the
class.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
if
they
come
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction,
probably
they
are
not
binding
the
class,
although
if
it
is
under
706
i
think
it
should.
now,
707
appears
to
be
more
of
a
situation
where
traditionally
broad
ranging
injunctive
relief
under
a
pattern
or
practice
case
come
in,
but
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes.
as
the
court
is
probably
aware,
it
has
already
heard
one
title
vii
case
today,
there
was
a
long
debate
in
congress
in
1971
and
'72
over
how
much
authority
to
give
the
commission.
congress
decided
that
the
provisions
under
706
permitting
individuals
to
file
suit
was
not
working
as
well
as
it
wanted,
so
we
had
the
two
approaches.
we
had
the
cease
and
desist,
which
would
have
given
them
an
awful
lot
of
authority
similar
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
in
that
case
the
commission
would
have
received
the
charge,
they
would
have
investigated
the
charge,
they
would
have
adjudicated
the
charge
and
would
have
prosecuted
the
charge
like
the
board
did.
but
congress
didn't
go
for
that.
they
said
no,
you've
got
all
the
regular
procedures.
we
are
going
to
be
fair
to
everybody.
we
are
going
to
be
fair
to
the
defendants
and
the
employer
is
going
to
be
fair
to
the
parties.
now,
we
believe
that
what
we
are
requesting
is
fully
in
accord
with
what
congress
intended
in
granting
court
enforcement
powers
to
the
commission.
they
didn't
give
it
unlimited
authority.
they
gave
it
the
same
authority
under
706
as
the
private
individuals.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
the
question
of
not
being
able
to--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
well,
your
honor,
i
can
raise
it.
let's
assume
there
is
a
subsequent
lawsuit
by
a
lot
of
employees
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
but,
your
honor,
what
happens
in
that
case
is
that
i
am
going
to
have
as
many
different
decisions
as
i
have
district
courts
in
our
five
states
that
litigated.
one
court
may
say,
well,
you're
bound
by
the
prior
decision
if
you
accept
relief;
one
court
may
say,
well,
you're
not
bound.
they
may
go
a
variety
of
different
ways.
we
don't
think
that
is
what
the
court
intended
or
what
this
court
wants
to
do.
we've
gone
through
the
various
parts
of
the
history.
there
is
no
question
that
the
courts
are
split
on
the
matter.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
we
believe
that
had
congress
intended
to
exempt
the
commission
from
rule
23,
it
would
have
done
so.
it
is
clear
that
in
the
legislative
history
congress
made
two
specific
references
and
changes
in
two
federal
rules.
it
made
a
change
in
rule
53
on
special
masters
to
insure
that
they
would
be
able
to
handle
these
cases.
they
made
a
change
in
rule
65.
what
you
get
out
of
that,
you
are
well
aware
that
congress
knew
about
the
federal
rules
and
knew
how
to
make
exceptions.
it
didn't
make
a
similar
exceptions
for
the
commission
under
706
for
a
class
action.
now,
it
did
talk
about
in
several
cases
in
the
post
history
and
throughout
the
committee
reports
that
the
commission
is
a
properly
suing
party.
under
rule
23
you
can
bring
class
action.
we
have
all
of
that.
now,
when
you
look
at
what
the
commission
can
do
under
706,
it
is
the
same
as
a
private
party.
we
are
not
seeking
greater
relief
or
anything
else.
the
charge
is
triggered
by
a
private
individual
in
both
cases.
investigation
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
the
conciliation
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
the
action
is
the
same
as
a
private
party
with
the
possible
exception
that
the
standing
is
broadened
to
include
other
unlawful
practices
discovered.
we
are
not
questioning
the
standing
as
such.
the
relief
is
the
same
as
under
706(g)
in
both
of
the
situations.
now,
when
the
private
party
instead
brings
the
suit
instead
of
the
commission,
all
absent
members
of
the
class
are
bound.
there
is
no
dispute
on
that.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
they
could
if
they
discovered
discrimination
charges
during
their
investigation
in
addition
to
sex
as
part
of
that
investigation
under
the
lower
court
decisions.
this
court
has
never
ruled
upon
that.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
what
we
are
saying
is
this,
is
that
as
far
as
the
typicality
requirement,
the
typicality
requirement
is
coextensive
with
the
standing
which
the
commission
is
to
bring
the
suit.
if
they
have
standing
to
bring
it
on
behalf
of
sex,
fine.
if
they
also
have
standing
to
bring
it
on
behalf
of
race,
fine.
the
question
here
isn't
the
standing.
we
recognize
there
are
cases
saying
the
commission
may
have
broader
standing
than
the
individual
charging
parties.
we
aren't
denying
that.
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
whatever
they
have
standing
to
bring,
that
determines
the
typicality.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
your
typicality,
your
reference
is
back
to
number
one,
the
charging
parties
and,
number
two,
the
people
who
were
not
charging
parties
but
who
may
have
had
claims
that
were
discovered.
it
can
be
both
groups.
you
may
have
to
handle
a
case
somewhat
differently
but
there
is
no
problem.
we
have
many
class
actions
where
you
have
different
types
of
claims
or
you
may
separate
those.
we
are
not
contesting
that.
that
is
not
a
question.
i
wanted
to
reserve
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
at
this
time
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
fine.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
fine.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
let
me
just
give
the
court
the
closest
analogy
i
can.
the
at&t
consent
decree
was
probably
what
prompted
this
litigation.
this
i
think
occurred
in
about
1969
or
1970.
the
government,
the
eeoc
and
the
at&t
entered
into
a
consent
decree
in
the
third
circuit.
there
was
no
binding
effect
upon
anyone
else.
the
union
challenged
that
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
and
petition
for
cert
was
denied.
there
were
challenges
in
every
other,
almost
every
other
circuit
throughout
the
country
and
those
are
cited
in
our
brief.
people
were
unhappy
with
what
had
been
negotiated.
they
were
not
bound
by
it.
they
were
entitled
to
bring
their
own
actions.
so
you
had
a
multiplicity
of
litigation
which
we
are
trying
to
avoid.
we
have
had
a
couple
of
questions
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that
is
a
red
herring.
that
is
a
unique
statute.
congress
recognized
in
that
situation
that
rule
23
would
apply
unless
it
made
an
exception.
congress
did
this.
to
file
a
private
action
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
you
have
to
file
a
written
consent.
rule
23-type
actions
are
not
permitted.
so
the
only
people
bound
are
those
who
file
a
written
consent,
and
the
only
people
who
get
relief
are
those
who
file
a
written
consent
to
be
a
party
plaintiff.
if
the
government
brings
a
fair
labor
standards
case,
the
right
of
action
is
terminated.
there
is
no
further
private
right
of
action.
so
we
have
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
what
we
are
asking
for
here,
we
want
some
finality.
we
want
to
resolve
litigation.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
section
706(e)
really
refers
to
the
remedy
and
there
is
no
question
that
because
of
the
type
of
situation
we
have,
we
are
talking
about
in
many
cases
you
cannot
just
give
an
award
of
back
pay.
we
believe
that
706(c)
was
drafted
to
provide
for
the
remedy
and
not
for
the
procedure.
the
court
may
say,
well,
you
can't
have
your
relief
if
you
are
going
to
bring
a
second
suit,
and
may
say
you
can
--
what
we
run
into,
however,
will
be
the
situation
we
believe
that
you
may
have
some
people
declining
their
relief
and
bringing
the
second
action
thinking
they
can
get
more;
you
will
have
as
many
different
decisions
as
you
have
district
courts.
and
i
do
not
believe
in
title
vii
this
court,
which
has
consistently
sought
uniformity
in
its
interpretation,
wants
a
case
by
case
approach.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
one
thing
you
did
say
in
that
case
--
and
i
have
read
the
case
--
is
that
you
thought
it
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources
to
stimulate
successive
lawsuits
by
other
aggrieved
parties,
and
we
concur
and
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
avoid
here.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
we
would
litigate
that.
it
would
resolve
it
on
its
own.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
she
would
only
be
requesting
individual
relief,
we
wouldn't
want
to.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
that
is
possible.
in
the
present
case,
the
government
however
has
requested
class-wide
relief.
they
have
mentioned
during
the
argument
up
here
that,
well,
you
know,
maybe
we
don't
want
to
do
this
but
we
are
not
bringing
this
on
behalf
of
the
people,
yet
they
have
requested
class-wide
relief.
all
we
are
saying
is
if
you
request
class-wide
relief,
comply
with
rule
23.
if
you
want
individual
relief
for
the
charging
parties
in
a
prospective
injunction,
no
rule
23.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
that
is
an
improper
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
know
cases
that
back
up
their
position.
they
are
talking
about
remedy
and
not
about
procedure.
there
are
cases
that
say
when
the
government
can
sue
in
its
own
name,
without
having
the
charge
trigger
by
a
private
party,
perhaps
incidental
to
the
court's
equity
powers
they
can
get
relief.
we
are
talking
about
the
procedure,
not
about
the
remedy.
in
this
case,
at
the
front
end
they
are
saying
we
are
suing
for
these
people,
we
want
personal
relief
for
them.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
the
complaint
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
what
they
have
said
was
in
very
broad
language,
for
all
these
people
that
have
been
excluded
from
these
two
categories
of
craft
jobs
and
managerial
jobs,
we
want
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
complaint,
paragraph
13,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
pages
7
to
11.
here
is
the
class
they
allege.
they
allege
that
unlawful
exclusions,
two
classes,
including
women
from
craft
jobs
and
from
managerial
jobs
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
they
don't
say
class
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
they
do
not.
but
the
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
they
did
not.
they
did
move,
however,
to
bifurcate
the
issue
of
class
liability
and
they
acknowledged
in
their
memo
opposing
our
motion
that,
"the
commission
acknowledges
that
it
seeks
relief
for
a
large
class
of
women"
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
am
reading
from
the
record,
page
215.
it
is
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
record
itself.
the
appendix
has
some
references,
and
i
think
it
is
in
our
brief,
but
the
record,
page
245,
they
say.
"the
commission
acknowledges
that
it
seeks
relief
for
a
large
class
of
women
in
this
lawsuit."
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
said
this
is
a
section
706
class
action
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor
--
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
dickens
no,
your
honor.
they
want
individual
class
relief
and
that
is
what
they
want.
they
want
it
and
we
say
fine,
but
we
would
like
procedures
which
are
well
recognized.
mr.
james
r.
dickens
your
honor,
i
have
to
agree
with
that,
yes.
thank
the
court
for
the
very
much
attention.
