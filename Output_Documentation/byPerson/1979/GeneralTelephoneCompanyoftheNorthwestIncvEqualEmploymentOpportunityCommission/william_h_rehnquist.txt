justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
i
may,
mr.
dickens.
why
would
eeoc
bring
a
class
action?
it
is
entitled
to
sue
as
a
litigant.
i
would
have
thought
it
could
have
gotten
virtually
all
the
benefits
of
its
litigant
status
as
a
litigant
on
behalf
of
the
government
without
denominating
its
action
as
a
class
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
definition
there
is
no
individual
in
any
conceivable
class
that
the
eeoc
could
represent
other
than
itself,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
congress
said
when
it
authorized
the
eeoc
to
bring
a
suit
on
its
own
behalf,
that
it
was
to
have
the
same
status
as
the
charging
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
what
congress
said
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
traditional
action
that
was
in
existence
long
before
'72
enabling
the
wage
and
hour
administrator
to
sue
to
enforce
practices
of
employers
contrary
to
the
wage
and
hour
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
could
he
have
brought
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
united
states
suing
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
a
civil
action
to
enjoin
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
could
it
bring
that
as
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
surprised
frankly
that
you
concede
that
the
civil
actions
authorized
by
congress
to
be
brought
by
the
eeoc
is
analogous
in
any
way
to
hunt
v.
washington
state
apple
growers
who
are
all
private
litigants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
eeoc
brings
an
action
against
your
client
simply
seeking
to
enjoin
practices
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
do
you
think
they
have
to
bring
that
as
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
they
don't
ask
for
--
what
if
they
simply
ask
for
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
is
intentional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
is
required
to
be
intentional,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
same
be
true
vice
versa
that
everything
could
be
accomplished
under
707
that
could
be
accomplished
under
706?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
two
were
virtually
interchangeable
in
the
view
of
the
sponsors
except
for
that
quality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
did
the
sponsors
want
706?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
an
action
by
the
administrator
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
would
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
he
bring
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
thought
the
law
wasn't
being
properly
enforced,
why
can't
it
gain
everything
it
wants
by
a
simple
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
an
argument
as
to
why
it
shouldn't
bring
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fair
labor
standards
administrator
has
the
right
to
seek
back
wages
for
people
who
have
been
discriminated
against,
too,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
does
not
the
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
this
in
a
sense
much
ado
about
nothing
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
government
ever
brought
a
claim
that
denominated
a
class
action
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
