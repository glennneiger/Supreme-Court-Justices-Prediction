justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
position,
mr.
wallace,
that
the
commission
could
not
bring
a
class
action
even
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
your
position?
i
am
not
asking
you
about
ours,
i'm
asking
you
about
yours.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
your
position
here
in
argument
before
this
court,
that
the
commission
cannot
bring
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
position
in
argument
here
is
that
the
commission
cannot
bring
a
class
action
suit
under
rule
23,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
good
deal
of
the
force
of
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
is
a
wholly
inappropriate
thing,
it
is
unworkable,
that
rule
23
clearly
is
not
designed
for
this
sort
of
an
action
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
and
yet
you
say
the
commission
can
bring
a
class
action.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
arguing
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
arguing
before
us
that
you
are
not
required
to.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
the
commission
cannot
do
it
--
you
say
no,
it
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
the
fifth
circuit
decision
is
entirely
wrong.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
you
say
you
can
do
it.
