justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
that
in
addition
to
certification
there
should
be
notice
to
all
the
class
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
one
in
which
they
ask
the
defendants
to
make
all
those
persons
adversely
affected
by
unlawful
employment
practices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
settlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dickens,
let
me
just
as
you
a
little
bit
about
how
you
handle
the
language
of
rule
23(a)
that
says
that
one
or
more
members
of
a
class
may
sue
or
be
sued
as
representatives
of
the
class.
is
it
your
theory
that
--
the
eeoc,
of
course,
is
not
a
member
of
the
class
but
is
suing
on
behalf
of
the
charging
parties
who
are
like
the
representative
plaintiffs.
is
that
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
true
and
your
charging
parties,
say,
are
charging
sex
discrimination,
say
they
are
four
female
employees
who
claim
there
was
discrimination
on
account
of
gender.
say
the
commission
in
its
investigation
decided
they
wanted
to
broaden
the
case
to
include
some
race
discrimination
charges,
could
they
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
would
the
charging
parties,
if
you
look
at
it
as
the
members
of
the
class
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
as
the
charging
parties,
could
they
represent
the
victims
of
race
discrimination
charge
was
based
on
gender
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall
you
in
effect
said,
well,
the
rules
apply
unless
congress
says
they
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
just
read
the
rules,
they
wouldn't
cover
this
double
capacity
kind
of
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rule
would
really
cover
maybe
a
sex
discrimination
suit
or
any
kind
that
would
be
an
appropriate
class
for
your
charging
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
there
was
in
porter
v.
warner
holding
company,
that
was
what
the
argument
was
about.
our
other
order
was
construed
by
the
majority
to
be
such
statutory
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
was
construed
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
only
authority
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
problem
doesn't
arise
unless
a
suit
is
brought
and
that
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
get
your
third
reason
in
answer
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
hadn't
missed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
after
a
lawsuit
has
been
filed
and
you've
made
all
the
decisions
that
enforcement
is
appropriate,
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
before
us,
is
it
the
practice
of
the
eeoc
to
give
notice
to
the
persons
for
whom
it
seeks
monetary
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
i
understand
it,
your
three
points
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
it,
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
government,
and
third,
the
language
of
rule
23
and
the
concept
of
rule
23
just
doesn't
fit.
but
you
don't
argue
that
there
would
be
any
special
burden
on
the
government
of
compliance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
include
that
as
one
of
your
three
points.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
you
don't
give
as
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
you,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
difference
it
would
make,
and
you
gave
three
legal
answers,
but
you
didn't
say
anything
about
any
burden
on
the
government
to
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
as
i
understand
your
opponent's
position.
if
i
understand
him
correctly,
he
says
that
you
can
enlarge
the
class
beyond
the
typicality
requirement
that
would
be
appropriate
if
the
specific
charging
parties
were
the
class
representatives,
that
you
are
not
so
limited.
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
really
are
going
to
have
much
of
a
typicality
problem.
the
problem
rather,
as
i
understand,
would
be
for
you
to
give
notice
of
the
people
that
you
intend
to
include
within
the
perimeters
of
the
litigation
and
so
the
judge
will
know
and
everybody
will
know
who
is
bound,
and
that
is
about
all
there
is
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
claim
that
the
government
doesn't
represent
them
adequately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
can
a
court
of
equity
do
if
an
employee
declines
to
take
the
award
that
is
available
to
him
and
decides
he
wants
to
bring
a
suit?
