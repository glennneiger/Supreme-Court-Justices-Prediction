who
are
all
the
members
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
government's
approach,
what
about
settlement?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
those
they
have
express
authority
to
do
it,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
on
behalf
of
named
parties
or
unnamed
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
weren't
and
suppose
the
united
states
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
only
authority
to
bring
suits
on
behalf
of
named
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
authority
is
only
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
named
parties
of
which
there
are
certainly
plenty
of
examples,
do
you
think
the
united
states
under
rule
23
could
nevertheless
bring
a
class
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
say
no.
you
should
say
that
you
are
really
just
exercising
a
strictly
special
statutory
authority
to
bring
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
might
then
be
a
real
representative
under
rule
23?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
it
wasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
the
naming
parties
are
bringing
a
class
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
of
those
involved
claims
for
monetary
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
in
one
cases
you've
got
a
lawsuit
and
in
the
other
case
you
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
somewhat
unusual
to
take
the
position
that
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
say
that
a
particular
individual
as
a
member
of
the
class
has
claim
for
back
pay
as
a
result
of
alleged
discriminatory
practices,
can
be
litigated
in
full
on
his
behalf
by
the
government
and
the
government
can
lose
and
then
he
can
file
the
same
lawsuit
all
over
again?
isn't
there
something
that
troubles
you
a
little
bit
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
government
does
not
bring
a
suit
on
behalf
of
private
parties
and
doesn't
get
relief
for
private
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
are
asking
for
back
pay
for
these
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
difference
is
that
here
you
are
asking
for
monetary
relief
on
behalf
of
particular
individuals,
which
is
not
the
case
in
the
antitrust
context.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
settled
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
if
the
government
brings
a
suit
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
wage
earners
and
fails
to
recover
on
their
behalf,
that
they
can
nevertheless
relitigate
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you
went
that
far
and
this
court
just
didn't
agree
with
you
and
said
you
are
just
wrong,
you
can't
go
that
--
you
can
bring
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
had
just
been
told
you
were
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
just
say
your
position
is
that
you
can't
bring
it,
because
if
we
disagree
with
you,
you
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
our
rule
as
well
as
congress'
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
feature
that
when
the
lawsuit
was
over
the
rights
of
the
parties
who
had
been
placed
within
the
class
early
in
the
proceeding
would
have
been
settled
once
and
for
all
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
another
lawsuit.
that
is
the
thing
they
are
seeking
to
accomplish,
and
i
don't
really
see
why
that
is
such
a
terrible
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
