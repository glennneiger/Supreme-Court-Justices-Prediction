mr.
frey,
do
you
think
that
when
you
say
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
from
the
outset,
are
you
talking
in
terry
terms
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
moment,
you
are
telling
us
what
the
district
court
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
that
at
the
time
they
first
spoke
to
her
that
they
had
a
right
to
pat
her
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
there
is
a
standard
below
terry
that
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
taking
the
position
--
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time
--
you
are
taking
the
position
that
something
less
than
terry
can
in
some
circumstances
justify
a
detention
against
the
will
of
the
person
detained?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
telling
us
what
the
district
court
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
were
half-way
through
that
and
you
haven't
even
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
show
as
to
what
carries
she
was
booked
on
as
far
as
the
rest
of
her
tickets
were
concerned--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
view
on
whether
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
never
arrested
her,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
very
word
"detention"
implies
being
held
against
somebody's
will,
and
if
she
went
voluntarily
along
with
them
to
the
office
and
voluntarily
consented
to
the
search
and
so
on,
there
was
no
detention
whatsoever
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
within
the
dictionary
meaning
of
that
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
talking
about
right
now.
you
were
talking
about
in
the
corridor,
weren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
all
his
advice
was
that
if
you
don't
want
to
be
searched,
i
won't
search
you?
is
that
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
he
was
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
he
was
telling
her
she
had
a
right
to
refuse,
the
legal
right
to
refuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
search,
which
you
say
there
was
consent
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
was
consent
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
citizen
would
have
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
these
same
things
happened
to
any
citizen,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
say
there
was
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
position
is
that
it
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
in
any
event,
the
answer
to
my
question
is
any
citizen
picked
out
at
random
would
not
have
had
his
fourth
amendment
rights
violated
by
these
events?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
happened
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
say
happened
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
consent,
that
she
voluntarily
went
to
the
office
and
that
finding
was
in
no
way
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
mistaken
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
would
be
your
argument
if
we
disagreed
with
you
about
probable
cause?
the
district
court
found
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
found
consent
to
search
the
purse.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sounds
like
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
would
argue
it
would
be
the
product
of
an
illegal
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
tell
us
how
often
he
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps
a
combination
of
things.
you
of
course
argue
in
part
that
the
initial
encounter
was
nothing
more
than
asking
a
bystander
a
question,
in
effect.
if
we
accepted
that
point
and
everything
after
was
consent,
then
we
wouldn't
have
to
reach
the
