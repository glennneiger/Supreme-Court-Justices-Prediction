chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
78-1821,
united
states
v.
mendenhall.
mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
preceding
the
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
the
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
rely
on
the
mimm
standard,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
contending
--
i
will
move
now
into
the
drug
office
--
are
you
depending
on
her
consent
to
a
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
american
doesn't
fly
between
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably
one
alternative
would
be
then
sit
down,
young
lady,
until
we
get
a
warrant.
that
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
karfonta.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
there
was
no
right
or
power
on
the
part
of
the
officers
to
ask
her
questions
and
ask
to
see
her
ticket
in
the
circumstances
that
existed
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
required
her.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
officers
may
ask
you
questions
quite
freely
of
citizens
and
citizens
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
if
they
want
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
do
you
become
adversary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
of
something
that
was
in
the
officer's
mind
or
is
it
something
that
was
in
her
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
there
was
certainly
some
tension
in
her
mind
because
she
knew
she
had
heroin,
but
the
officer
didn't
know
that
she
had
heroin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
if
the
person
in
fact
has
a
packet
of
heroin
on
their
person
or
in
a
package
in
their
possession,
then
that
gives
them
some
special
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
suggested
vulnerability
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
i
suppose
a
person
who
has
got
a
packet
of
heroin
does
indeed
feel
somewhat
vulnerable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
neighbor
comes
over
to
the
scene
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
described,
and
then
the
police
officer
says
will
you
please
just
wait
here
for
a
few
minutes,
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
--
arrest,
detention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
then
the
person
began
to
go
away
and
the
officer
said
i
want
you
to
stay
here,
there
has
been
a
homicide,
and
i
want
you
to
stay
here
as
a
material
witness
--
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably
arrested
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
as
you
are
leaving
the
court
room
today
one
of
the
officers
approaches
you
and
says,
"mr.
rodak,
the
clerk
of
the
court
would
like
to
see
you
for
a
few
minutes,"
what
do
you
think
your
situation
is?
are
you
detained,
are
you
arrested,
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
go
there,
to
his
office
and
the
secretary
says,
"well,
mr.
rodak
is
on
the
telephone,
will
you
sit
down
and
wait
for
five
minutes,"
are
you
detained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
perhaps
partly
because
you
know
that
you
have
no
heroin
on
you
or
no
contraband
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
at
all.
you
have
emphasized
the
vulnerability
of
a
witness.
you
would
go
very
freely
because
you
don't
feel
very
vulnerable
about
anything,
do
you,
in
this
setting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
consider
it
adversarial
if
the
particular
citizen
has
no
contraband,
no
drugs,
no
firearms
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
or
disturbed
the
finding
of
consent
to
the
search
in
the
drug
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
direct
statement
or
by
inference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
for
example,
if
they
got
to
pittsburgh
they
might
have
telephoned
pittsburgh
and
said
watch
this
woman
when
she
gets
off;
if,
one,
she
is
last
to
leave
the
plane,
and,
two,
she
looks
nervous,
and,
three,
she
doesn't
in
fact
have
any
luggage
to
pick
up,
then
stop
her
and
arrest
her,
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
are
the
additional
factors
that
you
suggest
might
supplement
what
mr.
justice
stewart
just
put
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
some
other
factors
might
show
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
don't
you
take
the
three
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
suppose
they
did
occur,
the
agent
found
in
pittsburgh
she
was
the
last
to
leave
the
plane,
as
she
had
been
before
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
that
she
did
not
have
any
luggage,
in
fact
even
though
that
is
quite
a
long
trip
to
be
without
luggage,
and
third,
she
acted
in
a
very
nervous
manner
in
the
same
way
the
telephone
call
had
described
her
conduct
previously,
do
you
think
those
might
finally
reach
a
point
where
it
would
cross
over
the
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
was
the
point
of
your
suggestion
that
they
wait
until
they
get
to
pittsburgh?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
one
of
them
would
be
that
if
on
arrival
in
pittsburgh
she
was
met
by
a
person
known
to
the
pittsburgh
agent
as
a
drug
dealer,
of
course,
there
you
are
so
far
over
the
line
that
you
are
leaving
no
room
for
any
analysis
at
all,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
are
getting
on
or
when
they
are
getting
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
how
much
of
a
layover
there
was
between
the
two
flights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
we
don't
know
whether
she
was
under
pressure
of
the
time
or
not,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
point
did
the
officers
find
out
that
she
had
three
different
names,
that
is
two
in
addition
to
her
true
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
