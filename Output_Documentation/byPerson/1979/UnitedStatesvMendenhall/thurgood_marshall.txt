want
to
extend
it
beyond

somebody
else
who
doesn't

attempted
to
leave
he
would
have
stopped
her?
justice

say
that?
justice

a
well
trained
witness.

an
intelligent
experienced
agent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can't
i
take
what
he
says
as
being
a
fact
in
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
exactly
did
he
testify
to?
justice
thurgood
