justice
potter
stewart
if
any,
i
mean
she
was
enroute
to
pittsburgh.
justice
potter
stewart
one
would
presume
that
they
would
know
where
the
various
airlines
went
to.
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
happened?
she
still
hadn't
been
directly
approached
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
first
time
there
was
a
direct
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
communication
with
her?
justice
potter
stewart
as
she
was
going
down
toward
the
gate
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
toward
the
eastern
gate
to
pittsburgh?
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
she
was
armed?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
terry
has
to
do
with.
justice
potter
stewart
from
your
answer,
i
don't
know
what
your
view
is,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
your
view
really
is
that
there
was
no
detention
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
in
the
office
there
was
a
detention.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
right,
what
could
have
been
done
in
pittsburgh?
there
is
no
probable
cause,
there
is
no
probable
cause,
either
in
detroit
or
pittsburgh.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case
you
are
suggesting,
well,
it
is
very
easy,
the
government
just
could
have
wired
ahead
or
telephoned
ahead
to
pittsburgh.
but
if
you
are
correct,
that
there
is
no
probable
cause,
there
is
no
probable
cause.
if
this
seizure
and
search
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
your
client
in
detroit,
a
seizure
and
search
would
equally
have
violated
those
rights
in
pittsburgh,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
karfonta,
before
you
sit
down,
you
take
the
position
that
had
she
refused
--
that
the
record
shows
that
if
she
had
refused
to
go
to
the
office,
that
the
officers
would
have
required
her
to
do,
that
they
had
intended
to
detain
her.
do
you
have
any
position
on
what
the
record
indicates
would
have
happened
if
after
the
female
officer
had
come
into
the
room
and
told
her
to
take
her
clothes
off,
that
if
she
had
refused
to
do
that,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
say
that
she
didn't
realize
until
that
happened
that
she
was
going
to
be
--
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
strip
search.
does
the
record
tell
as
what
she
would
have
done
and
what
would
have
happened
if
she
had
refused
to
take
that
additional
step?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
testimony
at
page
12
of
the
appendix
by
the
officer
that
before
she
went
to
the
office
she
gave
some
kind
of
consent,
and
i
thought
it
read
consent
to
the
search
of
the
purse
and
the
person.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
suppose
we
find
that
the
officers,
contrary
to
your
position,
the
officers
validly
acquired
probable
cause
at
some
point
prior
to
the
search,
prior
to
the
strip
search,
would
you
say
you
have
lost
your
case
or
or
not,
or
would
you
have
some
other
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
officers
never
validly
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
right
this
time,
but
we
don't
know
whether
maybe
one
out
of
ten
or
nine
out
of
ten.
