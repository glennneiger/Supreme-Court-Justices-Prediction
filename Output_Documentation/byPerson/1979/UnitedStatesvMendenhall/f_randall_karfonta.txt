mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
randall
karfonta,
representing
sylvia
mendenhall
in
this
case.
initially,
i
would
briefly
like
to
clarify
some
of
the
facts
on
this
record.
first
of
all,
the
agents
were
looking
for
basically
any
citizen
to
stop.
there
was
no
information
that
any
specific
heroin
was
coming
to
detroit,
nor
were
they
looking
for
any
specific
individual.
as
far
as
the
lack
of
baggage
factor
goes,
a
close
reading
of
the
record
will
show
that
at
the
hearing
the
agent
didn't
contend
that
this
was
of
continuing
significance;
rather,
the
government
has
continued
to
argue
it
in
their
briefs.
as
far
as
the
detention
in
the
office,
the
record
contains
no
written
or
oral
consent.
it
is
absolutely
barren
of
any
consent
to
going
to
that
office.
once
sylvia
mendenhall
was
in
that
office,
she
was
asked
to
take
a
seat
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
matter
of
a
search
was
raised.
the
matter
of
a
strip
search
was
first
raised
after
the
consent
was
allegedly
given,
and
at
that
point
sylvia
mendenhall
said
i
have
to
catch
my
plane,
i've
got
got
to
leave,
and
she
was
told
that
she
would
be
free
to
leave
if
she
had
nothing
on
her.
she
kept
repeating
that
and,
as
the
testimony
states,
then
began
taking
her
clothes
off,
taking
her
time.
as
to
the
matter
of
time
that
was
raised
during
the
prosecutor's
argument,
the
time
as
is
reflected
on
the
record
was
five
to
six
minutes
until
the
consent
to
search
was
given,
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
how
long
it
took
to
call
the
female
officer
for
the
female
officer
to
come
to
the
office
and
for
the
actual
search
itself
to
begin.
our
first
contention
is
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
she
was
in
that
private
locked
dea
office
for
the
purpose
of
a
search
of
her
body.
the
entire
transaction,
the
design
and
execution
was
for
an
investigatory
seizure
to
search
sylvia
mendenhall.
a
reasonable
person
in
those
circumstances
could
only
believe
that
they
were
under
arrest.
she
was
not
told
she
was
free
to
leave.
she
was
not
asked
when
her
plane
was
leaving,
and
the
setting
of
the
office
itself
makes
that
clear.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
nothing
like
any
of
the
stop
facts
this
court
has
discussed.
i
believe
as
far
as
this
court
has
gone
was
in
united
states
v.
brignoni-ponce,
and
in
that
case
we
are
talking
about
searches
that
were
usually
--
or
stops,
rather,
that
were
usually
a
minute
in
duration
and
involved
a
visual
inspection.
there
were
no
exigencies
present
in
this
case.
rather,
the
detention
in
this
case
is
much
more
and
is
merely
exactly
like
the
detention
in
dunaway
v.
new
york,
where
dunaway
was
transported
to
a
police
station,
placed
in
an
interrogation
room
and
was
not
informed
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
the
only
difference
here
was
that
sylvia
mendenhall
was
also
being
held
in
communicado.
we
have
examined
the
case
law
of
this
court
and
we
have
found
three
criteria
for
determining
the
point
of
arrest
--
freedom
of
movement,
the
purpose
of
the
detention,
and
the
duration
of
the
detention.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
your
honor,
i
believe
that
under
brown
v.
texas
it
is
clear
that
when
they
asked
to
see
her
driver's
license,
required
her
to
answer
questions
and
then
required
her
to
give
them
her
airline
ticket,
that
she
had
been
seized
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
yes.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
that
this
court
unanimously
held
just
last
term
in
brown
v.
texas
that
when
the
officers
detained
the
appellant
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
him
to
identify
himself,
they
performed
a
seizure
of
his
person
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
the
government
has
referred
to
mr.
lafave's
treatise
and
i
know
that
in
his
treatise
he
makes
the
differentiation
between
an
adversarial
contact,
which
is
how
i
would
characterize
this
case,
and
seeking
information
from
citizens
in
general
regarding
community
matters.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
believe
in
this
case
it
was
adversary
from
the
beginning
because
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
believe
that
it
would
be
in
the
officer's
mind,
in
her
mind
and
also
the
objective
circumstances.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
well,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
consent
issue,
that
schneckloth
indicates
that
in
determining
consent
you
have
to
consider
the
vulnerable
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
person
from
whom
consent
is
being
sought.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
don't
believe
so.
i
guests
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
on
this
record
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
yes,
well,
i
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
true,
judge.
i
think
the
argument
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
here
the
testimony
was
that
the
point
this
consent,
this
alleged
consent
to
the
detention
was
given,
sylvia
mendenhall
was
so
nervous
she
was
unable
to
speak,
barely
able
to
put
her
license
in
her
purse,
back
in
her
purse,
and
i
think
that
schneckloth
says
that
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
an
individual
is
very
important
in
determining
the
consent,
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
probably
not
arrest
or
detention,
but
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
probably.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
as
i
was
first
discussing,
in
dunaway
v.
new
york
the
court
held
that
freedom
of
movement
is
a
controlling
factor
in
determining
the
point
of
arrest.
here
i
believe
the
objective
circumstances,
the
fact
that
sylvia
mendenhall
was
not
told
she
was
free
to
go,
and
the
fact
that
in
fact
she
was
not
free
to
go
indicate
satisfaction
of
that
factor.
secondly,
we
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
detention.
here
the
purpose
of
the
detention
was
not
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
it
was
not
for
identification
purposes.
the
officer
testified
that
on
the
concourse
he
was
satisfied
that
this
person
was
sylvia
mendenhall.
rather,
the
only
purpose
in
going
to
that
office
was
to
search
for
narcotics,
and
sbron
v.
new
york
and
ybarra
v.
illinois
indicate
that
when
the
purpose
is
to
search
for
narcotics
that
probable
cause
is
required
because
that
situation
is
an
arrest.
finally,
the
length
of
the
detention,
united
states
v.
brignoni-ponce
says
detention
must
be
brief.
in
that
case,
the
detentions
were
ordinarily
about
a
minute.
here,
sylvia
mendenhall
was
not
told
she
was
free
to
leave.
in
their
court
of
appeals
pleadings,
the
government
has
indicated
that
if
a
person
refuses
consent
in
the
dea
office,
dea
then
seeks
a
search
warrant.
in
the
companion
case,
in
an
en
banc
hearing
in
this
case,
the
officer
testified
"well,
then
we
told
mr.
camacho
that
it
would
take
us
an
hour
or
three
or
four
hours
to
obtain
this
search
warrant."
no
time
was
ever
specified
in
this
case.
it
was
a
potentially
indefinite
detention.
i
think
the
law
of
this
court
is
clear,
that
once
sylvia
mendenhall
was
in
that
interrogation
office,
the
situation
was
an
arrest;
and,
further,
i
think
common
sense
indicates
that
this
is
an
arrest
situation.
there
was
no
consent
to
that
detention.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
record
is
barren
of
any
verbal
or
written
consent
to
that
detention.
sylvia
mendenhall
was
not
told
she
had
any
choice
about
going
to
that
office.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
well,
i
would
answer
that
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
would
say
on
the
second
point
you
are
mistaken
in
the
sense,
that
they
said
there
was
no
consent
to
the
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
you're
right,
judge,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
you're
not.
what
i
would
indicate
though
is
that
this
record
is
totally
barren
of
anything
indicating
consent
to
the
detention,
therefore
the
finding
of
the
district
court
is
easily
clearly
erroneous,
there
is
nothing
on
this
record
indicating
that.
further,
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
she
would
have
chosen
this
in
communicado
detention,
she
was
extremely
nervous,
facts
ate
all
these
facts
militate
a
free
and
voluntary
consent.
but
most
importantly,
there
is
nothing
on
this
record
stating
any
consent
to
a
detention.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
don't
think
this
is
the
kind
of
adversarial
confrontation
between
a
police
officer
and
a
citizen
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
that
question
is
like
when
did
you
stop
beating
your
wife.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
of
the
dea
agents,
some
of
whom
i
know,
came
up
to
me
and
said
we
want
you
to
go
into
this
little
room
off
the
corridor
here,
away
from
the
court
room
and
we're
going
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
some
of
the
things
you
said,
i
would
be
a
little
apprehensive.
but
if
it
was
going
to
mr.
rodak's
office,
i
don't
think
this
is
the
kind
of
adversarial
confrontation
between
a
police
officer
and
a
citizen
that
the
commentators
in
the
cases
envisioned.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
thing
that
is
the
entire
part
of
the
defense's
contention
in
this
case,
is
on
the
kinds
of
factors,
this
person
was
stopped
and
then
arrested,
it
could
apply
to
the
search
of
anyone
anywhere
on
just
basically
nothing.
i
think
that
is
the
point,
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
allow
these
kinds
of
wholesale
intrusions.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
definitely
do.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
believe
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
there
was
no
consent
to
the
search
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
united
states
v.
mccaleb.
just
one
more
point
on
the
consent
to
the
detention,
and
that
is
that
bumper
v.
north
carolina
also
makes
it
very
clear
that
mere
acquiescence
in
the
face
of
authority
is
not
the
kind
of
free
and
voluntary
consent
that
is
required.
secondly,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
stop
when
all
the
agents
knew
that
the
point
of
the
stop
was
that
sylvia
mendenhall
had
flown
from
los
angeles
to
detroit,
was
the
last
person
off
the
airplane
and
noticed
the
agents.
now,
the
government
has
argued
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
was
speaking
of
the
point
of
the
initial
search,
your
honor.
the
government
has
additionally
argued
two
factors,
transfer
of
airline
plans
and
lack
of
baggage.
those
both
are
facts
that
evaporated
prior
to
the
stop
in
this
case.
great
emphasis
has
been
placed
in
these
cases,
these
airport
profile
cases
on
the
experience
of
the
agents,
but
i
think
that
in
order
to
--
that
experience
is
a
two-way
street,
that
when
the
agents
see
something
that
negates
suspicion,
that
should
stop
them
from
detaining
a
citizen.
here
the
agents
proceeded
proceeded
to
detain
the
citizen
even
though
there
was
no
transfer
of
airlines
factor
in
this
case.
the
government
has
argued
that
these
experienced
agents
are
familiar
with
all
the
airline
schedules.
well,
in
this
case
the
agent
testified
on
the
record
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
relevant
airline
schedules.
further,
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
would
support
his
conclusion
that
she
was
changing
airlines.
this
experienced
agent
should
have
known
that
when
she
went
to
that
eastern
counter
and
they
said
all
you
need
to
get
on
that
plane
is
a
boarding
pass,
that
she
was
already
scheduled
on
that
flight.
further,
had
he
known
the
airline's
schedule
or
taken
a
moment
to
check
it,
he
would
have
found
that
there
was
no
american
flight
from
detroit
to
pittsburgh.
this
transferred
airlines
factor
has
appeared
in
no
other
case.
in
fact,
in
other
arrests
in
reported
opinions
that
occurred
at
detroit
metropolitan
airport,
using
direct
flights
was
the
factor
in
those
cases.
second
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
well,
judge,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
you
have
to
consider
everything
that
the
agent
actually
knew
and
in
our
brief
we
contend
that
the
profile
itself
does
not
arise
reasonable
suspicion
and
none
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
it
has.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
i
believe
that
when
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
and
there
are
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
that
have
found
reasonable
suspicion,
but
then
a
proper
stop,
an
investigatorial
stop
and
reasonable
suspicion
is
proper.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
oh,
yes.
i
do
because
i
think
that
it
is
common
law
that
such
things
as
flight
can
be
considered
in
arrest
situations,
and
so
i
think
all
factors
can
be
considered.
i
think
that
is
a
very
elusive
factor,
but
certainly
all
factors
ought
to
be
considered.
as
i
indicated,
the
lack
of
baggage
factor
also
evaporated
prior
to
the
stop
in
this
case.
the
agent
didn't
even
contend
that
it
was
of
continuing
significance
to
him;
rather,
the
government
has
continued
to
argue
it.
at
any
rate,
once
he
knew
she
was
going
on
to
pittsburgh,
through
common
sense
or
through
the
airline
regulations
he
should
have
realized
that
she
would
have
no
baggage
with
her.
proper
police
practice
in
this
case
i
believe
would
have
been
to
continue
the
surveillance,
as
has
been
done
in
a
number
of
second
circuit
cases,
such
as
united
states
v.
cates.
they
knew
she
wasn't
leaving
the
airport,
they
could
have
called
ahead
to
pittsburgh
if
they
wanted
to
watch
her
and
set
up
a
proceeding
to
detain
a
citizen.
looking
quickly
at
the
factors
they
did
know,
the
flight
from
los
angeles
to
detroit,
it
seems
that
in
these
profile
cases
the
government
has
virtually
characterized
almost
every
city
as
being
a
source
or
a
place
you
go
through
or
destination
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
used
the
example
of
the
united
states
v.
oates,
when
they
got
to
pittsburgh,
a
bulge
mysteriously
appeared,
that
he
had
talked
with
a
known
narcotics
dealer,
the
traveling
companion
was
a
known
narcotics
addict
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
i
am
indicating
is
that
if
they
had
continued
their
investigation
perhaps
something
else
would
have
turned
up.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
no.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
am
indicating
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
guess
i
am
indicating
that
since
those
are
the
same
factors
we
have
in
detroit,
and
since
i
don't
feel
that
those
factors
have
very
much
value,
that
those
factors
occurring
twice
would
not
have
been
--
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
right.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
not
to
raise
reasonable
suspicion,
no,
i
don't.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
the
point
of
my
suggestion
was
that
very
often
in
continuing
an
investigation
additional
factors
do
turn
up
and
sometimes
they
don't,
and
then
you
cannot
proceed
to
detain
a
citizen.
mr.
f.

i
don't
believe
that
is
true.
i
think
that
in
looking
at
the
case
law,
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
have
both
held
that
mysterious
bulges
such
as
in
one
case,
a
person
was
seen
walking
with
an
odd
gait,
with
an
odd
bulge
in
the
crotch
are
indicating
that
there
was
something
concealed
there,
i
think
those
kinds
of
factors
can
begin
to
create
reasonable
suspicion.
i
don't
think
these
totally
innocuous
things,
where
there
is
no
tie-in
with
criminal
activity,
can
present
justification
for
stopping
a
citizen.
as
to
the
nervousness
factor,
it
is
difficult
to
hypothesize
on
a
more
common
characteristic
to
airline
passengers
than
nervousness.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
as
far
as
i
personally,
i
would
say
that
would
be
from
the
time
i
leave
home
until
the
time
i
arrive
at
my
destination
away
from
the
airport.
following
the
government's
case
here,
i
believe
it
is
similar
to
brown
v.
texas
as
there
is
no
tie-in
with
criminal
activity.
in
spenell
v.
united
states,
mr.
justice
white
wrote
in
concurrence,
no
one
would
suggest
that
just
anyone
getting
off
the
10:30
train
dressed
as
draper
was,
with
a
brisk
walk
and
carrying
a
zipper
bag,
should
be
arrested
for
carrying
narcotics.
i
query
whether
mr.
justice
white
would
have
felt
differently
had
draper
been
last
off
the
train.
other
circuits
have
reviewed
circumstances
very
similar
to
this
case.
we
cited
united
states
v.
ballard,
a
fifth
circuit
case,
in
our
brief,
at
pages
37
and
38.
and
i
recently
last
week
sent
a
recent
second
circuit
opinion,
united
states
v.
buena
venture,
and
they
reach
the
same
obvious
result,
that
this
is
not
a
sufficient
cause
for
stopping
a
citizen.
the
drug
courier
profile
itself
is
an
amorphous
unwritten
conglomeration
of
characteristics
which
the
government
characterizes
as
constantly
changing.
some
courts
have
commented
that
the
profile
seems
to
change
itself
with
the
facts
of
each
case.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
characteristics
we
have
listed
in
our
footnotes,
you
would
see
there
would
be
a
rare
airline
passenger
that
would
not
fit
several
of
these
characteristics,
and
this
is
particularly
true
given
the
agent's
ability
to
find
satisfaction
of
a
profile
factor,
regardless
of
the
facts.
there
is
no
national
profile,
there
is
no
detroit
metropolitan
airport
profile,
and
there
is
no
agent
anderson
profile.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
refused
to
uphold
the
stops
of
citizens
based
on
this
profile
because
of
the
recommendation
of
the
power
to
do
so
would
allow
basic
searches
of
citizens
anywhere
without
cause.
i
would
like
--
as
far
as
any
discretion
reducing
aspect
of
the
profile,
what
the
profile
really
is
is
a
screen
for
the
abuse
of
government
power
because
the
agents
pick
and
choose
among
the
many
that
it
describes.
finally
--
i
see
my
time
is
short
--
the
consent
to
the
search
in
this
case
was
not
freely
and
voluntarily
given.
schneekloth
speaks
of
a
familiar
territory
case,
where
it
is
always
very
congenial,
the
defendant
was
with
five
or
six
friends,
where
the
interrogation
in
a
remote
station
house
inapposite.
here
that
is
exactly
the
setting
we
have.
sylvia
mendenhall
was
in
that
setting,
she
was
quite
shaken.
she
was
not
told
she
was
free
to
leave,
she
was
not
told
she
had
any
choice
about
the
detention.
the
first
time
anything
about
a
search
was
mentioned
was
when
she
was
inside
that
room.
the
first
time
anything
about
a
strip
search
was
mentioned
was
after
the
alleged
consent
was
given,
and
then
she
revoked
the
consent
by
saying,
well,
i
have
a
plane
to
catch
and
she
was
told,
well,
if
you
don't
have
anything
on
you,
you
don't
have
anything
to
worry
about.
she
kept
saying,
well,
i
have
a
plane
to
catch
and
she
was
slow
in
taking
her
clothing
off.
finally,
we
would
contend
that
the
alleged
consent
here
was
also
the
product
of
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
and
a
stop
without
reasonable
suspicion
and
that
taint
was
not
removed.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
we
do
not.
it
is
clear
that
for
consent
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
show
that
consent
was
free
and
voluntary.
like
brown
v.
illinois
and
new
york
v.
dunaway,
here
there
was
a
party
of
purposefulness
and
an
expedition
for
evidence
undertaken
in
the
hope
that
something
would
turn
up.
we
contend
that
the
methodology
here
was
to
cause
--
and
this
has
been
characterized
by
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
court
to
cause
surprise,
fright
and
confusion.
i
think
the
law
of
this
court
is
clear
on
each
of
these
points
and,
moreover,
i
think
common
sense
supports
our
contention,
i
think
the
contentions
of
the
government
would
be
basically
to
do
away
with
the
case
by
case
approach
in
fourth
amendment
cases
and
this
our
constitution
does
not
allow.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
(inaudible)
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
believe
defense
counsel
cross-examined
both
the
agent
and
the
female
officer
as
to
each
point
--
was
she
free
to
go
at
the
point
of
the
stop,
was
she
free
to
go
at
the
point
of
arrest,
was
she
free
to
go
at
the
point
of
consent,
and
at
each
point
the
answer
was
no.
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
point
of
my
position
that
you
just
mentioned
in
your
question,
and
that
was
--
i'm
not
sure
i
can
remember
it,
but
our
position
on
the
consent
to
the
detention
is
that
the
record
is
barren
of
any
consent
and
therefore
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
what
it
says
here
is,
"i
asked
her
to
accompany
myself
and
agent
myhills
to
our
office
which
was
very
nearby,"
but
there
is
no
indication
that
she
was
told
she
had
any
choice.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
written
or
oral
consent
and
the
record
does
show
that
she
was
so
nervous
at
that
point
that
she
could
hardly
speak
not
return
her
identification
to
her
purse.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
i
suppose
my
argument
would
be
at
that
point
that
if
there
were
no
exigencies,
that
a
search
warrant
should
have
been
sought.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no,
you
don't.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
no.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
the
district
court
actually
--
and
i'm
glad
you
give
me
a
chance
to
clarify
this
--
i
think
the
district
court
was
wrong.
the
district
court
said
that
at
the
point
they
first
reached
the
office,
there
was
no
probable
cause.
where
the
district
court
found
probable
cause
was
after
they
went
through
her
purse.
that
is
where
the
district
court
found
probable
cause.
and
although
i
disagree
with
that,
the
district
court
specifically
said
no
probable
cause
when
they
first
got
to
the
office.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
that
point
was
on
the
concourse.
no,
i'm
sorry,
the
ticket
in
another
name
was
found
out
on
the
concourse.
the
third
name
was
found
after
they
went
through
her
purse.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
well,
i
guess
i
would
say
at
that
point
that
it
would
be
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
at
the
point
that
they
have
consent
to
search
her
purse,
i
would
contend
that
that
would
be
a
product,
a
tainted
product
of
the
illegal
stop.
mr.
f.
randall
karfonta
or
an
illegal
stop.
