and
the
facts
were
she
was
the
last
off
the
airplane
and
then
she
went
to
the
american
airlines
counter
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
and
it
was
there
that
she
was
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
her
baggage
was
checked
through
to
pittsburgh,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
have
you
thought
whether,
even
if
there
was,
whether
the
search
was
justified
without
consent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
say
that
you
just
don't
ever
reach
any
of
those
questions
because
you
don't
care
to
have
to
decide
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
if
consent
was
voluntary,
it
might
be
the
product
of
an
illegal
detention?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
frey,
do
i
misunderstand
the
record?
i
was
under
the
impression
he
obtained
her
consent
before
they
went
to
the
office.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
she
was
asked
for
an
additional
consent
in
the
office?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
missed
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it,
with
respect
to
probable
cause.
suppose
we
thought
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
in
the
office,
what
would
your
argument
be
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
you
claim
there
was
an
arrest.
you
argue
consistently
all
through
that
there
was
an
arrest.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
not,
but
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
your
position
if
sustained
in
this
case
would
allow
you
to
make
virtually
random
stops
if
you
could
get
the
kind
of
sequence
of
events
you
got
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
sequence
of
events
ends
up
in
an
office
upstairs
in
the
airport
with
the
suspect
taking
his
clothes
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
would
not
be
random
stops
if
all
of
these
facts
existed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
this
issue
which
you
now
describe
as
critical
we
need
address
only
if
we
are
not
persuaded
on
the
consent
sequence?
