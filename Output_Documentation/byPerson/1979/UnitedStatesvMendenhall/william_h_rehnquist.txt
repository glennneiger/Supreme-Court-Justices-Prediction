rehnquist
but
it
also
depends
on
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
you've
been
here
often
enough
so
that
you
will
understand
this
question
may
be
repetitious.
is
my
understanding
that
your
first
contention
is
that
a
simple
approach
by
a
police
officer
to
someone
and
say
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
is
not
a
detention
at
all
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
a
seizure
of
the
person
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
issuing
carrier,
but
american
airlines
doesn't
fly
from
detroit
to
pittsburgh.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
an
agent
at
that
airport,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
judge
demascio's
finding
that
before
the
actual
search
was
made
there
was
probable
cause?
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
it
did
nothing
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
cryptic
is
the
word
i
would
use.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no.
no,
it
isn't.
if
no
consent,
probable
cause
to
search.
is
the
search
okay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
frey,
in
the
office
when
the
officer
advised
her
that
she
need
not
consent
to
the
search,
he
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
an
assertion
or
an
opinion
that
he
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
if
you
arrest
you
don't
have
any
right
to
refuse
to
search.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
i
take
it
your
basic
position
is
that
an
officer
could
just
at
random
pick
out
somebody
in
an
airport
and
do
exactly
--
and
the
same
events
that
happened
here
transpired
and
you
would
say
there
was
no
violation
of
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
any
of
these
--
as
a
result
of
any
of
these
events
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
asking
them
into
the
office
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
say
they
did
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
a
difference
between
saying
come
over
here,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions,
and
simply
coming
up
to
person
and
saying
what's
your
name?
i
mean
is
there,
a
separate
concept
of
detention
as
opposed
to
simply
posing
a
question
to
a
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
karfonta,
supposing
the
police
are
investigating
a
dead
body
they
found
on
a
lawn
in
front
of
somebody's
house
and
they
see
a
neighbor
looking
over
and
the
policeman
simply
calls
over
and
he
says
do
you
know
anything
about
this,
is
that
a
detention
or
arrest
or
terry
stop?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
this
case
she
had
been
booked
from
los
angeles
to
minneapolis,
she
immediately
arrives
in
minneapolis,
goes
to
the
counter
of
an
airline
that
has
a
flight
from
minneapolis
to
new
york
and
switches
her
ticket
or
perhaps
buys
a
ticket
from
minneapolis
to
new
york,
and
the
agent
says
that's
unusual
because
you
could
have
easily
booked
directly
out
of
los
angeles
to
new
york
without
going
to
minneapolis.
is
that
a
permissible
profile
factor
to
consider?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
nothing
short
of
probable
cause
then
is
sufficient
to
even
warrant
further
interrogation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
think
that
any
rather
strange
conduct
in
airline
routing
and
sudden
changes
of
destinations
are
permissible
factors
in
a
profile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
need
a
warrant
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
need
a
warrant
to
arrest
on
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
frey,
on
your
direct
argument,
your
initial
argument
you
weren't
talking
any
position
or
whether
there
was
or
was
not
probable
cause
to
arrest,
i
take
it
then
i
walk
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
never
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
prior
to
the
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
defend
that
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
wasn't
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
was
consent
all
along
the
line,
we
don't
have
to
decide
that.
