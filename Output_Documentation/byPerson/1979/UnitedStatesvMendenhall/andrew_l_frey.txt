mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
reversing
respondent's
conviction
for
possession
of
heroin
on
the
ground
that
the
heroin
in
question
had
been
discovered
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
search.
the
case
began
when
two
trained
dea
agents
assigned
to
the
detroit
airport
observed
respondent
deplane
from
an
early
morning
flight
from
los
angeles
which
they
knew
to
be
a
major
source
city
for
heroin.
the
agents
became
suspicious
when
she
exhibited
unusual
nervousness
and
scanned
the
terminal
area
as
though
looking
for
surveillance.
after
following
her
through
the
airport
and
having
their
suspicions
reinforced,
they
approached
her
as
she
was
proceeding
down
the
concourse
toward
the
gate
for
an
eastern
airlines
flight
to
pittsburgh.
they
identified
themselves
as
federal
agents
and
asked
if
she
would
show
them
some
identification
and
her
ticket.
she
did
so
and
they
discovered
that
she
was
traveling
under
an
assumed
name.
after
several
more
questions,
they
asked
if
she
would
accompany
them
to
the
nearby
dea
office
for
further
questioning,
which
she
did.
once
inside
the
office,
the
agents
asked
respondent
if
she
would
consent
to
a
search
of
her
pocketbook
and
of
her
person,
informing
her
that
she
had
a
right
to
refuse
consent
to
the
search.
she
consented
and
the
ensuing
search
disclosed
over
half
a
pound
of
heroin.
the
entire
encounter
took
about
ten
minutes.
the
district
court
found
that
the
agents
had
a
reasonable
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
initial
encounter
in
the
airport
concourse
took
about
two
or
three
minutes,
and
then
the
further
events
in
the
dea
office
took
another
five
to
ten
minutes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that
is
what
the
evidence
was.
in
any
event,
up
to
the
point
where
the
consent
was
given
to
the
search
was
a
relatively
brief
period
of
only
a
few
minutes.
the
district
court
found
that
the
agents
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
respondent
was
engaged
in
criminal
activities
at
the
time
they
first
approached
her,
that
she
went
to
the
office
with
the
agents
voluntarily
in
a
spirit
of
apparent
cooperation,
and
that
she
thereafter
voluntarily
consented
to
the
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
district
court
i
think
was
talking
in
terry
terms.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
intend
to
devote
most
of
my
argument
to
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
terry
stop
and
if
so
whether
the
quantum
of
suspicion
was
sufficient
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
telling
you
what
the
district
court
held,
that's
correct.
i
think
ultimately
my
answer
is
probably
no,
that
the
standard
is
not
the
same
as
terry
but,
rather,
the
lesser
standard
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
they
had
a
right
to
pat
her
down
and
frisk
her
but
that
relates
to
the
reasonable
perception
that
she
might
be
dangerous,
which
i
don't
think
they
had.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
does
and
i
do
think
they
had
a
right
to
detain
her
at
the
time
they
first
spoke
to
her,
that
is
to
stop
her.
i'm
not
asserting
that
they
had
a
right
to
frisk
her
and
they
didn't
frisk
her.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
intended
to
rely
on
martinez-fuerte
for
that
proposition,
because
in
martinez-fuerte,
as
i
will
get
to,
the
court
suggested
that
the
quantum
of
suspicion
that
was
needed
for
a
roving
patrol
stop
in
brignoni-ponce
was
not
necessary
for
a
referral
to
the
secondary
inspection
area
for
questioning
in
martinez-fuerte,
and
i
think
--
while
i
think
they
had
enough
suspicion
to
meet
the
normal
brignoni-ponce
standard
in
this
case,
i
think
the
minimal
nature
of
the
intrusion
required
even
less
suspicion
than
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
terry
--
terry
enunciated
a
standard
on
the
facts
of
terry
and
held
that
what
was
known
to
the
officer
justified
the
action
that
he
took
in
terry.
i
think
that
the
court's
ensuing
cases
have
made
clear
that
the
inquiry
is
a
measurement
of
the
degree
of
intrusion
involved
in
the
particular
police
action
weighed
against
the
degree
of
suspicion,
the
basis
for
the
officer's
action
in
the
law
enforcement
needs.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
saying
that
the
kind
of
encounter
that
incurred
in
the
airport
between
the
agents
and
respondent
mendenhall,
which
we
first
contend
was
not
a
seizure
of
her
person
at
all
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
contention
and
holds
that
it
is
a
seizure,
i
am
contending
next
that
some
suspicion
that
might
not
justify
the
stop
of
an
automobile
or
a
frisk
would
justify
going
up
to
somebody
and
asking
them
questions
as
was
done
here.
and
i
am
further
contending
that
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
that
what
existed
here
was
enough
for
a
terry
stop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
a
seizure
of
the
person
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
first
contention.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
making
two
alternative
arguments,
either
of
which
would
justify
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
first
that
it
was
supported
by
her
consent
and
therefore
did
not
have
to
meet
other
fourth
amendment
requirements,
and
the
second
that
it
did
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment,
assuming
that
the
consent
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
the
first
one
and
therefore
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
our
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that
what
you
would
do
logically
would
be
to
first
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
second
issue
if
you
agree
with
us
on
the
first
with
regard
to
the
move
to
the
office.
the
district
court
sustained
the
move
to
the
office
on
the
ground
of
respondent's
consent
to
go
to
the
office.
if
that
finding
is
not
clearly
erroneous
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
i'm
not
sure
i
have
answered
justice
marshall's
question,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
insisting
that
you
reach
the
second
issue
about
whether
this
would
be
permissible
in
the
absence
of
her
consent,
but
if
you
find
that
there
was
not
a
valid
consent
then
we
do
present
that
second
issue
for
your
decision.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
in
essence
the
court
held
that
the
factors
relied
upon
to
justify
the
initial
encounter
with
respondent
did
not
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
because
respondent's
actions
as
observed
by
the
agents
were
consistent
with
innocent
behavior.
it
further
held
that
asking
respondent
to
accompany
the
agents
to
the
dea
office
constituted
an
arrest
requiring
probable
cause
on
the
ground
that
respondent
was
not
free
to
leave
at
the
time
this
occurred.
finally,
the
court
held
that
the
consent
to
the
search
was
not
valid.
present
for
decision
by
this
court
are
three
questions,
each
of
which
has
two
sub-issues.
the
first
question
concerns
the
initial
encounter
between
the
agents
and
the
respondent
and
whether
that
violated
her
fourth
amendment
rights.
and
as
i
have
mentioned,
we
contend
that
it
did
not,
for
two
reasons
first,
we
contend
that
it
was
not
a
seizure
of
her
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment;
and,
secondly,
we
contend
that
if
it
was,
it
was
supported
by
the
necessary
degree
of
suspicion
to
justify
the
particular
minimal
intrusive
encounterment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
also
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
can
get
into
that
some
detail,
if
you
would
like.
the
facts
or
which
the
agents
relied
were
first
that
she
came
from
los
angeles
which
--
they
were
watching
the
flight
from
los
angeles
because
it
was
known
by
them
to
be
a
source
city
of
mexican
heroin.
when
she
got
off
the
plane,
she
got
off
last,
but
i
think
that
is
a
sub-category
of
the
fact
that
she
looked
around
as
though
locking
for
surveillance
and
seemed
unusually
nervous,
and
that
i
think
is
quite
clear
is
what
triggered
the
agents'
suspicion
of
her,
and
indeed
i
will
argue
that
that
in
itself,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
agents'
experience
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
what
the
agents
thereafter
did.
they
in
fact
followed
her
as
she
went
down
to
the
baggage
area,
didn't
picked
up
any
baggage--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
know
whether
she
had
any
baggage
or
not.
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
telling
you
what
occurred.
the
agent
had
no
idea
at
that
point
whether
she
was
getting
off
at
detroit
or
making
a
connection
some
place
else.
so
as
he
described
it
in
his
testimony
initially,
he
followed
her
down
to
the
baggage
area
she
didn't
picked
up
any
baggage.
it
would
have
been
suspicious
if
she
have
been
getting
off
at
detroit.
she
then
went
back
up-stairs
to
the
eastern
airlines
counter
and
appeared
to
the
agent,
asked
the
ticket
agent
at
the
eastern
counter
for
a
ticket
on
an
eastern
flight
to
pittsburgh.
it
appeared
to
the
agent
that
she
was
changing
her
flight
from
some
other
carrier
to
eastern.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
record
does
not
clearly
show
what
carrier.
the
record
shows
that
--
he
testified
that
it
was
an
american
airlines
ticket
which
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
say
that
and
i
accept
that
as
true,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
significance
of
that
is
in
terms
of
--
the
question
is
not
whether
the
agent
was
right
that
she
had
originally
been
booked
on
american
airlines
to
pittsburgh.
we
simply
don't
know
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true,
but
one
would
presume
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
a
fair
question
to
presume.
i
think
that
is
a
subject
which
should
have
been
explored
on
cross-examination.
in
any
event,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
whether
or
not
she
was
changing
from
some
other
carrier
to
eastern.
the
testimony
is
"i
stood
in
line
directly
behind
her,
she
retrieved
an
airline
ticket
from
her
purse,
presented
that
to
the
eastern
ticket
agent
and
asked
for
a
ticket,
an
eastern
ticket
to
be
used
on
her
flight
from
detroit
to
pittsburgh."
now,
i
don't
think
our
case
is
dependent
on
the
ultimate
accuracy
of
this
observation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
then
the
ticket
agent
gave
her
a
boarding
pass
for
the
eastern
flight,
she
started
down
the
concourse
and
at
that
point
the
agents
came
up
to
her
and
said
we're
federal
agents,
would
you
please
show
us
your
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
the
first
contact
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
down
the
concourse.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
in
any
event,
in
terms
of
my
statement
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
before
i
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
issues,
the
second
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
transfer
of
the
situs
of
the
interviewer
encounter
from
the
airport
concourse
to
the
dea
terminal
office.
and
as
i
suggested,
we
have
two
arguments
there.
one,
that
it
was
supported
by
her
voluntary
consent
and
the
second,
that
it
was
in
any
event
a
reasonable
limited
extension
of
a
terry
stop.
by
the
way,
at
the
point
they
went
to
the
airport
office,
there
is
no
question,
i
don't
think
it
is
disputed,
that
they
had
at
least
terry-type
reasonable
suspicion
because
they
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
us
say
prignoni-ponce
reasonable
suspicion.
whatever
the
constitutional
--
however
high
the
court
chooses
to
set
the
constitutional
floor
for
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion,
less
than
probable
cause,
a
seizure
of
the
person,
not
a
frisk
but
a
seizure
of
the
person,
a
detention,
this
case
satisfied
it
once
the
agents
talked
to
her
and
found
out
she
was
traveling
under
an
alias,
because
we
are
now
close
to
if
not
over
the
line
of
probable
cause,
and
i'm
sure
that
constitutes
suspicion
or
reasonable
suspicion
in
anybody's
book
to
justify
the
stop.
and
i
don't
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
said
that
there
was
not
reasonable
suspicion
at
that
point,
and
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
when
they
moved
to
the
office,
we
have
now
shifted
our
debate
to
whether
they
needed
probable
cause
to
justify
that
movement,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
that
probable
cause
was
necessary
to
support
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
they
disagreed
with
it.
the
opinion
is
rather
succinct
and
it
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
perhaps
--
and
it
is
difficult
to
tell,
but
i
think
one
can
only
conclude
that
they
did
not
agree
with
his
finding
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
that
i
think
essentially
is
--
it
is
not
something
we
have
contended
here
because
in
our
view
it
is
not
--
probable
cause
is
not
necessary
for
what
occurred.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
at
the
time
of
the
search,
i
think
it
is
quite
arguable,
because
at
the
time
of
the
search
of
her
person
which
disclosed
the
heroin,
they
not
only
knew
that
she
had
been
traveling
under
one
alias
coming
back
from
los
angeles
but
that
she
had
traveled
on
yet
a
different
alias
and
going
on
yet
a
different
carrier
going
out
from
pittsburgh
to
los
angeles
which
i
would
suppose
is
consistent
with
an
evasive
pattern
that
drug
couriers
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
haven't
really
thought
about
it
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
there
was
probable
cause?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
the
same
question,
isn't
it?
if
there
was
probable
cause
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
search
would
be
okay
if
the
detention
at
that
point
was
not
a
fruit
of
a
prior
fourth
amendment
violation,
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
separate
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
was
the
emergency
in
terms
of
searching
her
person?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
would
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
her
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
search
her,
and
the
search
could
be
made
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
rely
--
we
don't
ask
you
to
decide
whether
this
was
supportable
as
a
probable
cause
search.
we
rely
on
her
consent,
which
the
district
court
found
to
be
voluntary
and
which
i
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
questioned
the
voluntariness
of.
and
if
she
was
legally
detained
at
the
time
she
consented,
then
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
striking
down
the
search.
if
she
was
illegally
detained,
than
that
raises
the
issue
of
whether
the
taint
of
the
illegal
detention
was
attenuated
by
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
might
be.
indeed,
under
the
court
of
appeals
view,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
you
could
not
give
a
voluntary
valid
consent
when
you
are
in
an
illegal
detention.
our
view,
of
course,
is
that
you
can
in
the
particularly
way
of
advice
of
your
right
to
refuse
to
consent,
that
attenuates
the
taint.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
view
is
that
there
was
no
detention
at
the
initial
encounter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
have
thought
about
that
and
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
our
success
in
this
case
at
all
that
it
can
be
held
that
there
was
no
detention
by
the
time
she
was
in
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
our
position.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
although
that
then
raises
the
question
which
i
had
not
planned
to
get
into
of
their
subjective
intention
to
detain
her
as
she
attempted
to
leave.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did
testify
--
are
you
talking
about
when
she
had
consented
to
the
search?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
the
corridor
the
testimony
is
quite
ambiguous
as
to
the
point
at
which
he
would
have
stopped
her
had
she
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
that
once
he
found
out
she
was
traveling
under
an
alias
he
would
have
stopped
her
had
she
attempted
to
leave.
but
our
position
--
and
it
is
arguable,
i
have
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
is
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
take
it
as
a
fact
that
he
would
have
stopped
her
once
he
found
out
she
was
traveling
under
an
alias
had
she
tried
to
leave.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
testimony
--
the
particular
testimony
that
we
are
adverting
to
now
was
given
on
cross
examination
in
response
to
what
seems
to
me
a
somewhat
ambiguous
question.
he
is
describing
the
--
this
is
at
page
18
and
19
of
the
appendix
--
and
he
says
they
looked
at
her
license
and
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
sylvia
mendenhall.
and
then
the
question,
had
she
put
that
identification
in
her
purse
and
walked
away
from
you,
you
would
have
stopped
her,
wouldn't
you,
because
you
wanted
to
ask
her
some
more
questions,
and
he
says
yes.
now,
i'm
now
quite
clear
because
it
is
never
clarified
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
of
course.
i
don't
argue
--
our
position
is
that
what
he
would
have
done
is
not
material,
it
is
only
what
he
did
do
that
counts.
but
you
are
right
that
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
--
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
clear
from
this
record
that
he
intended
to
forcibly
detain
her
from
the
very
first
moment
he
approached
her.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
at
all
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did
advise
her
that,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all,
since
i
think
the
normal
practice
and
the
proper
practice
is
to
seek
consent
even
if
you
do
believe
you
have
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
you
could
tell
somebody
that
they
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
search
in
an
effort
to
insure
that
you
have
secured
the
voluntary
consent
even
though
if
they
say
i
refuse
you
could
then
say
well,
i
have
decided
that
i
am
going
to
arrest
you
and
search
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
saying
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
saying
do
you
consent
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
exactly,
yes.
he
was
telling
her
that
she
had
the
legal
right
to
refuse
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
and
we
don't
know
if
she
had
said
no,
i
refuse,
what
would
have
happened.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
officer
thought
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
he,
he
might
very
well
then
have
sought
a
warrant
in
order
to
do
it.
but
since
he
obtained
her
consent,
the
question
never
arose
as
to
what
he
should
do
if
she
didn't
consent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
two
different
findings
of
consent
by
the
district
court.
the
first
is
that
she
consented
in
a
spirit
of
apparent
cooperation
voluntarily
to
go
from
the
terminal
to
the
nearby
office,
and
the
second
is
a
finding
that
once
in
the
office
and
asked
for
a
consent
to
search,
she
voluntarily
consented
to
be
searched.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
quite
clear.
in
fact,
he
is
asked
to
recite
in
specific
words
the
words
that
he
used.
now,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
question
of
whether
what
happened
here
was
a
seizure.
the
position
of
respondent
and
of
the
aclu
essentially
is
that
when
a
police
officer
approaches
someone
whom
he
finds
suspicious
and
asks
that
person
questions,
that
ought
to
be
presumptively
a
seizure
in
the
absence
of
a
statement
to
the
individual
that
they
have
a
right
to
leave.
now,
as
terry
makes
clear,
seizure
is
an
actual
restraint
upon
the
individual's
freedom
to
walk
away.
accordingly,
we
agree
with
professor
lafave's
analysis
of
the
problem
and
we
quote
from
him
in
our
brief,
that
this
kind
of
encounter
is
only
properly
deemed
a
seizure
if
the
officer
is
engaged
in
some
additional
conduct
beyond
the
approach
and
the
inquiry,
whether
by
action
or
by
statement
that
would
indicate
to
the
individual
that
his
freedom
of
movement
has
been
curtailed.
now,
the
court
has
not
squarely
decided
this
issue,
but
we
do
think
terry
indicates
the
court's
view
on
it,
and
i
refer
to
footnote
16
in
terry,
where
the
court,
in
talking
about
whether
the
initial
contact
between
the
officer
and
terry
at
which
he
walked
up
to
him
and
asked
him
for
identification
was
a
seizure,
saying
that
it
didn't
have
to,
wasn't
going
to
decide
that,
the
court
said
obviously
not
all
personal
intercourse
between
policemen
and
citizens
involve
seizures
of
persons,
only
when
the
officer
by
means
of
physical
force
or
show
of
authority
has
in
some
way
restrained
the
liberty
of
a
citizen
may
we
conclude
that
a
seizure
has
occurred.
we
cannot
tell
with
any
certainty
upon
this
record
whether
any
such
seizure
took
place
here
prior
to
officer
mcfadden's
initiation
of
physical
contact
for
the
purpose
of
searching
terry
for
weapons.
now,
of
course,
if
the
view
of
respondent
were
correct,
they
could
have
told
perfectly
well
that
there
had
been
a
seizure
because
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
is
our
position,
that
there
would
not
be
a
seizure
but
i
do
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
talking
only
about
walking
up
to
somebody
and
asking
them
a
couple
of
questions
and
for
identification.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
they
consent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
would
clearly
be
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand,
that
would
be
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
because
--
the
difference
is
that
when
you
come
to
a
search,
you
are
talking
about
an
action
which
is
in
fact
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right.
i
say
it
is
lawful,
yes,
it
is
consistent
with
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that
a
particular
incident
does
not
implicate
the
fourth
amendment
and
saying
that
an
incident
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
in
the
one
case
i
would
say
it
is
not
implicated
and
the
other
not
violated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
had
he
agreed
to
cooperate
right
down
the
road
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
as
happened
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
let
me
just
--
i
just
want
to
emphasize
again
martinez-fuerte
because
i
don't
think
we
made
this
point
quite
clear
in
our
brief.
but
in
martinez-fuerte
what
was
involved
was
an
initial
stop
at
a
check-point
followed
by
a
referral
to
a
secondary
inspection
area
based
essentially
on
the
officer's
suspicion
and
nothing
more
than
an
indication
of
mexican
ancestry
on
the
part
of
the
passengers
of
the
car.
that
unquestionably
is
a
seizure
of
the
occupants
of
the
car
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
yet
the
supreme
court
upheld
that
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
that
they
said
was
not
to
satisfy
the
requirements
for
stopping
an
automobile
in
brignoni-ponce.
now,
in
this
case
what
everyone
may
conclude
about
the
suspicion
that
existed
on
the
part
of
the
officers,
i
think
there
was
a
great
deal
more
than
the
suspicion
that
was
considered
satisfactory
in
martinez-fuerte.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
have
a
couple
of
minor
points
and
one
i
think
of
fairly
major
importance
that
i
hope
to
be
able
to
talk
about.
the
first
point
is
on
the
question
of
where
she
was
going,
whether
she
was
going
on
american
airlines.
you
are
being
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
facts
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court.
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
doing
that
in
a
case
where
the
respondent's
own
lawyer
in
the
district
court
was
not
aware
of
this
supposedly
obvious
factor.
indeed,
everybody
conceded
in
the
district
court
that
she
was
changing
her
flight
and
the
whole
case
was
argued
on
that
basis.
there
was
no
exploration
on
cross-examination,
and
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
that
he
be
right
in
his
belief
that
she
was
changing
flights
but
only
that
he
have
some
basis
that
would
add
to
his
suspicion.
now,
with
regard
to
brown
v.
texas,
it
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
this
case
because
in
brown
v.
texas,
brown
was
convicted
of
failing
to
give
his
identification
after
having
been
lawfully
stopped.
it
would
have
availed
the
state
of
texas
nothing
to
argue
that
he
was
not
stopped
in
that
case,
since
that
would
have
been
a
confession
of
error,
and
the
court
makes
quite
clear
in
its
opinion
that
since
the
conviction
can
be
sustained
only
if
he
was
lawfully
stopped,
the
question
is
whether
the
facts
known
justified
a
stop.
there
was
no
occasion
in
brown
to
discuss
whether
the
initial
encounter
was
a
stop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
raises
the
problem
of
what
we've
presented
to
the
court
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
and
whether
you
are
free
--
i
mean
the
district
court
did
find
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
search
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
haven't
asked
for
review
on
that
ground,
but
i
would
defend
that.
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
you
would
certainly
be
well
within
propriety
to
do
so
since
we
didn't
challenge
that
conclusion
of
the
district
court.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
critical
point
in
this
case
which
is
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
flimsy
basis
for
the
stop,
assuming
that
the
court
determines
that
this
was
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
of
her
person.
there
is
a
wide
gulf
between
the
respondent's
position
and
ours,
and
i
think
respondent's
position
is
that
you
must
have
virtually
probable
cause
in
order
to
have
a
stop
on
founded
suspicion,
and
his
reference
to
draper
was
extremely
revealing
because,
of
course,
the
question
in
draper
was
probable
cause
and
not
founded
suspicion.
now,
in
the
present
case
agent
anderson
had
ten
years
of
experience
in
drug
enforcement
and
was
many
months
stationed
at
the
detroit
airport.
now,
during
this
period
he
received
specialized
training
and
he
watched
tens
of
thousands,
probably
hundreds
of
thousands
of
passengers
and
participated
in
a
substantial
number
of
drug
arrests.
now,
when
he
saw
respondent
deplane
and
scan
nervously,
as
though
looking
for
surveillance,
it
does
not
strain
credulity
to
accept
that
agent
anderson
knew
the
difference
between
the
nervousness
of
people
who
are
scared
of
flying,
worried
about
missing
a
connection
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
record
does
not
tell
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
what
we
are
talking
about,
the
record
does
not
indicate,
although
there
is
an
opinion
which
does
in
the
garcia
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
which
indicates
that
very
few
people
are
stopped.
in
that
particular
case,
they
had
watched
nine
flights
come
in
during
the
day
before
they
stopped
a
single
--
approached
a
single
person
and
in
that
case
it
was
i
think
quite
clearly
a
stop.
we
are
not
talking
about
picking
large
numbers
of
people
out.
we
are
not
talking
about
an
invidious
selection
of
people
for
stopping.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
first
position
that
this
is
not
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
allow
a
police
officer
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment
to
approach
somebody
and
ask
a
question,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
implicated
at
that
point,
at
the
point
of
the
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
not
violated
in
these
events.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i've
now
moved
to
the
argument
about
whether
there
is
founded
suspicion
if
this
is
a
stop
and
there
we
are
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply,
and
i
am
saying
that
we
have
a
very
limited
intrusion
and
the
experience
of
the
agents
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
would
have
to
decide
it
--
you
have
to
decide
with
respect
to
the
initial
encounter
in
the
airport
concourse
whether
(a)
it
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
or
(b)
if
it
was
it
was
lawful,
because
otherwise
what
ensued
following
that
encounter
was
arguably
a
fruit
of
the
initial
illegality.
so
the
consents
--
we
are
only
relying
on
the
consent
in
the
sense
that
her
voluntary
cooperation
at
this
stage
in
showing
her
identification
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
would
not
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
was
founded
suspicion
or
probable
cause
at
any
point,
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
