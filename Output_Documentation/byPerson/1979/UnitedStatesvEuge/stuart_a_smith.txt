mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
presented
involves
the
enforceability
of
an
internal
revenue
service
summons.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
has
the
statutory
authority
to
issue
a
summons
requiring
a
person
to
appear
and
execute
handwriting
exemplars
in
aid
of
an
administrative
investigation
to
determine
his
correct
tax
liability.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
undisputed
and
i
can
summarize
them
quickly,
as
follows
in
october
1977,
special
agent
patrick
finnessey
was
assigned
to
investigate
respondent
euge's
tax
liability
for
the
period
1973
through
1976.
this
period
came
to
the
attention
of
the
internal
revenue
service
because
the
respondent
had
filed
no
tax
returns
for
any
of
these
years
and
he
had
sought
no
extensions
for
the
filing
of
these
returns.
the
case
had
been
referred
to
the
intelligence
division
by
the
audit
and
collection
division
after
it
had
been
determined
that
no
tax
returns
were
filed.
the
special
agent
determined
to
compute
the
respondent's
tax
liability
by
means
of
the
bank
deposits
method.
so
the
scrutiny
focused
on
respondent's
bank
accounts.
now,
respondent
had
two
bank
accounts
in
his
own
name
but
the
investigation
revealed
that
there
were
20
other
bank
accounts,
the
bank
statements
of
which
were
sent
to
post
office
boxes
in
respondent's
names.
these
bank
accounts
were
in
other
names
and
there
were
signature
cards
on
file
with
these
20
different
bank
accounts
that
bore
addresses
of
properties
owned
by
the
respondent.
moreover,
there
were
frequent
transfers
between
these
bank
accounts.
these
facts
suggested
to
the
agent
that
respondent
was
maintaining
bank
accounts
under
aliases
to
conceal
taxable
income.
the
amounts
were
substantial.
for
1975,
these
20
different
bank
accounts
had
an
aggregate
balance
of
approximately
$50,000
and
for
'76,
it
was
something
like
$30,000.
special
agent
served
a
summons
on
respondent
requiring
him
to
appear
and
execute
handwriting
exemplars
of
the
various
signatures
on
these
bank
accounts,
so
that
he
could
take
these
handwriting
exemplars
and
submit
them
for
handwriting
analysis
by
an
internal
revenue
service
handwriting
laboratory.
respondent
stated
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
seems
to
be
correct,
yes,
because
the
briefs,
i
think,
were
printed
at
the
expense
of
the
court.
after
respondent
told
the
agent
at
the
time
that
he
wouldn't
comply
with
the
summons,
so
the
united
states
and
the
special
agent
commenced
this
summons
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
held
a
hearing,
the
transcript
of
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
and
briefly,
the
special
agent
testified
as
to
the
nature
of
the
investigation,
the
purpose
of
the
investigation,
the
necessity,
the
relevancy
and
the
necessity
for
the
handwriting
exemplars,
and
he
also
testified
that
he
had
made
no
recommendation
with
respect
to
any
criminal
prosecution
of
respondent.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
handwriting
exemplars
are
relevant
and
necessary
to
completion
of
the
service's
investigation.
the
district
court
then
ordered
the
summons
enforced
and
ordered
respondent
to
provide
exemplars
of
eight
different
signatures,
eight
different
signatures
written
out
ten
times
each.
in
fact,
there's
a
particular
form
that
the
service
has
for
this
purpose.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
heard
the
case
en
bloc
and
reconsidered
and
thereafter
overruled
its
prior
decision
in
united
states
v.
campbell,
that
was
a
two
to
one
panel
decision
which
it
upheld
the
service's
statutory
right
to,
statutory
authority
to
require
the
execution
of
these
handwriting
exemplars.
the
opinions
below
are
brief
because
the
majority
simply
said,
"we
overrule
campbell
and
adopt
the
dissenting
opinion
in
campbell,"
and
the
dissent
simply
says
i
would
follow
campbell.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
campbell,
in
campbell,
is
itself
brief.
briefly,
what
it
says
is
that
it
views
the
handwriting,
process
of
requiring
a
handwriting
exemplar
as
a
search
and
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
dissenting
judge
went
on
in
that
case
to
say
that
those
charged
with
investigation
and
prosecutorial
duties
should
not
be
the
sole
judges
of
when
to
utilize
what
he
called
constitutionally
sensitive
means
in
pursuing
their
tasks.
there
are
two
statutes
involved
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
that
there
is
statutory
authority
to
require
the
execution
of
this
handwriting
exemplar.
the
statutes
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
1a
and
2a,
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
section
7601
is
the
so-called
canvass
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
which
the
court
has
explored
in
many,
many
different
decisions,
most
recently
in
the
lasalle
national
bank
and
also
in
the
joe
doe
summons
case
of
several
terms
ago,
united
states
v.
bisceglia.
and
this
sort
of
charges
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
his
delegate,
the
commissioner,
to
cause
officers
to
proceed
throughout
each
district
and
inquire
after
and
concerning
all
persons
therein
who
may
be
liable
to
pay
any
internal
revenues
tax.
section
7602,
the
immediately
succeeding
section,
is
the
summons
authority.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
subparagraph
2
of
that,
which
gives
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
the
authority
to
summon
the
person
liable
for
a
tax,
and
if
i
can
just
move
over
to
page
2a,
to
appear
before
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
at
a
time
and
place
named
in
the
summons
and
to
product
such
books,
papers,
records
and
other
data,
and
to
give
such
testimony
under
oath
as
may
be
relevant
or
material
to
such
inquiry.
and
the
third
subparagraph
empowers
the
officer
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
take
such
testimony
of
the
person
concerned.
we
believe
that
the
compulsory
process
authority
set
forth
in
the
statute
to
require
a
person
to
appear
and
to
give
such
testimony
as
may
be
relevant
reasonably
carries
with
it
the
statutory
authority
to
compel
a
witness
to
exhibit
certain
specific
physical
characteristics,
such
as
handwriting
or
voice
exemplars.
this
proposition
we
think
has
been
well
established,
not
only
by
decisions
of
this
court
but
by
the
pertinent
authorities.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
and
i
think
that
mara
and
dionisio
to
the
extent
are
relevant
here,
really
refute
the
dissenting
judge
in
campbell's
view
that
there
was
some
kind
of
constitutionally
sensitive
thing,
either
from
the
fifth
amendment
point
of
view
or
the
fourth
amendment
point
of
view.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
established
that
this
is
not
testimonial
compulsion,
and
that
it's
also
established
that
exhibiting,
you
know,
that
requiring
someone
to
give
a
voice
exemplar,
show
his
face,
give
fingerprints
or
whatever,
is
not
a
search
and
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
really
constitutional
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
well,
we're
arguing
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
testimony;
right,
exactly.
given
the
statutory
power
to
take
testimony
of
a
non-privileged
nature,
since
these
non-testimonial
acts
are
non-privileged
as
established
by
decisions
of
this
court,
that
that
statutory
authority
is
reasonably
inherent
in
the
authority
to
compel
somebody
to
appear.
because
if
you
--
in
other
words,
if
you
can
compel
somebody
to
appear
before
a
revenue
agent
and
let's
say
the
revenue
agent,
let's
say
in
this
particular
case
--
or
take
the
case
of
bisceglia,
where
somebody
had
made
a
large
deposit
to
to
a
bank,
the
service
had
a
teller
who
thought
he
could
identify
the
person,
and
there
was
a
suspicion
that
it
was
the
person
under
investigation,
if
he
were
brought
in,
quote,
"to
appear,"
the
revenue
agent
could
say
to
the
teller,
"is
this
the
fellow
who
deposited
the
400
one
hundred
dollar
bills,"
or
whatever.
it's
that,
exhibition
of
his
face,
which
is
inherent
in
the
statutory
authority
to
compel
somebody
to
appear.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
literal
wording
doesn't
cover
this
case,
but
we
think
that
given
the
recent
decision
of
law
construing
the
statutory
authority
in
a
broad
way
to
enhance
the
service's
power
to
find
out
information
and
to
discharge
its
canvass
duty,
to
go
around
and
to
find
out
who
owes
tax,
that
this
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute,
and
it
doesn't
offend
any
constitutional
concerns,
and
there
really
is
no
policy
reason
to
construe
the
statute
in
any
other
way.
for
example,
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
germane
is,
the
court
observed
in
bisceglia
that
had
the
taxpayer
or
the
bank
official
in
that
case
been
called
before
a
grand
jury,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
that
the
grand
jury
could
compel
the
bank
official
to
answer
questions.
and
the
court
analogized
the
service
summons
authority
to
the
grand
jury
authority
to
seek
information.
we
don't
think
that
there
really
is
--
we
think
that
analogy
coupled
with
the
statutory
language
which
we
think
is
hospitable
to
our
construction
more
or
less
carries
the
day
and
demonstrates
the
error
of
the
court
below.
because
here
again,
had
the
respondent
been
called
before
a
grand
jury,
there's
no
question
that
he
would
have
to
make
these
handwriting
exemplars,
and
the
protections,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
is
well,
you
know,
he
doesn't
have
any
protections
in
this
case.
somehow
there
is
a
--
this
is
being
decided
by
an
internal
revenue
officer
that
he
has
to
do
this,
and
that
he
doesn't
have
any
protections
of
the
neutral
officer.
but
i
think
it's
well
established
that
the
whole
summons
enforcement
mechanism
is
replete
with
protections,
not
only
of
a
statutory
nature,
but
the
protections
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
decisions
like
donaldson
and
powell,
which
more
or
less
indicate
that,
you
know,
that
more
or
less
say,
without
any
question,
that
a
summons
from
the
internal
revenue
service
is
not
self-executing,
that
person
can
object
to
its
enforcement,
as
indeed
respondent
did
in
this
case,
and
that
you
have
the
interposition
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
determine
whether
the
summons
is
over-broad
and
a
variety
of
questions
which
courts
determine
every
day.
in
fact,
you
have
the
full
adversary
proceeding
which
enables
a
person
to
object
to
particular
questions.
in
fact,
you
have
the
right
to
appear
with
counsel
when
you
go
to
comply
with
the
summons,
which
you
don't
have
in
the
grand
jury.
i
think,
you
know,
it
more
or
less
demonstrates
to
us
the
truth
of
the
court's
observation
in
bisceglia
that
congress
has
provided
protection
from
arbitrary
or
capricious
action
by
placing
the
federal
courts
between
the
government
and
the
person
summoned.
so
that
the
analogy
between
the
internal
revenue
service
summons
and
the
grand
jury
subpoena
we
think
is
sound
and
provides
all
the
necessary,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
provide
all
the
necessary
protections
in
this
case.
we
don't
see
really
that
there's
any
real
problem
either
from
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
nature
with
construing
the
statute
in
a
way
to
provide
giving
these
handwriting
exemplars.
i
simply
say,
and
i
simply
address
another
point
of
objection
which
we
think
is
really
without
force,
is
the
fact
that
the
court
below
felt
somehow
that
the
service
has
no
authority
to
force
somebody
to
create
things;
in
other
words,
that
somehow
you
can
get
a
piece
of
paper
or,
you
know,
books
and
records,
but
you
can't
say
to
somebody.
"okay,
come
in
and
create
something
for
us."
but,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
us
there
are
really
two
answers
to
that.
you
are
not
really
asking
anybody
to
create
something
when
you
ask
them
to
provide
handwriting
exemplars.
all
you're
really
doing
is
asking
them
to
display
physical
characteristic,
much
the
same
way
that
when
you
take
someone's
photograph,
you're
not
creating
their
face,
or
if
you
record
their
fingerprints,
you're
not
creating
their
fingerprints.
all
you're
doing
is
recording
a
physical
characteristic.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
think
it
would,
also.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
think
it
would
--
you
know,
the
whole
gamut
of
non-testimonial
disclosures,
like
asking
somebody
to
put
on
a
hat,
or
you
know,
these
things
are
normally
not
done
in
tax
investigation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
summons
authority
power?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that,
you
know
at
this
stage,
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that
the
civil
and
criminal
aspects
of
the
case
are
intertwined.
so
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
i
can
answer
that
question
and
say
that
a
criminal
case
is
being
prepared
here.
i
think
that
what
--
in
effect
it
may
be
nothing.
in
other
words,
just
like
the
400
$100
bills
in
bisceglia
might
have
turned
out
to
be
an
innocent
thing,
and
in
fact,
to
go
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
assuming
that
the
balances
that
went
into
the
accounts
were,
represented
unreported
taxable
income.
they
all
could
have
been
inheritances
from
his
grandmother.
again,
this
is
really
an
attempt
to
ferret
out
information
in
order
to
determine
what
the
scope
of
the
liability
is
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it's
possible
that
he
could
then
say
that
an
elderly
aunt
left
him
all
of
this
money.
i
think
the
question
would
be
fairly
put,
you
know,
is
to
where
this
money
came
from.
but
the
point
is
again,
you're
right,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
if
there
were
demonstrated
to
be
his
signatures,
i
think
that
he
would
have
an
obligation
to
explain
why
he
felt
the
need
to
maintain
20
different
bank
accounts
with
false
names.
that's
not
the
normal
kind
of
thing
that
people
do.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i
don't
think
there's
any
federal
prohibition,
but
i
suspect
that
he
probably
ran
the
gamut
here
and
used
false
social
security
numbers,
and
you
know,
i
suspect
at
that
point,
there
probably
--
because
you
do
have
an
obligation,
i
think
to
give
your
bank
an
appropriate,
you
know,
the
correct
social
security
number
so
they
could
report
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
that's
right,
exactly.
and
in
fact,
if
i
may
just
pursue
this
for
a
moment,
that
really
goes
to
one
of
the
things
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
as
one
of
the
really
prime
necessities
for
this
kind
of
summons.
apparently
it's
become
quite
common
for
people
to
file
multiple
tax
returns
asking
for
refunds
and
there
is
now
a
program
in
the
service
called
the
questionable
return
program
which
is
designed
to
determine
who
these
people
are.
apparently
as
of
1976,
the
service
has
determined
that
some
8,900
returns
were
questionable
returns
and
sought
refunds
in
the
aggregate
of
$12.3
million.
and
then
of
course
there's
a
whole
host
of
--
i
mean,
the
imagination,
it's
only
limited
by
one's
imagination
to
think
of
the
number
of
instances
in
which
document
authentication
is
an
important
part
of
an
internal
revenue
service
inquiry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
recollection
is
that
several
years
ago,
it
certainly
came
long
after
i
worked
for
the
summer
that
you
could
file
a
particular
form
and
absolve
yourself
of
withholding,
if
you
could
demonstrate,
on
the
assertion,
on
the
assurance
that
you
were
not
going
to
have
taxable
income
in
excess
of
a
certain
amount
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
this
over-withholding.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
aware
of
any
statutory
prohibition,
but
of
course
there
is
a
statutory
provision
against
concealing
taxable
income
and
not
reporting
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not;
absolutely
not.
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no,
no.
well,
all
it
does
in
this
case
is
to
--
i
think
that
all
i
am
saying
in
this
case
is
that
these
facts
reasonably
suggested
to
the
internal
revenue
service
that
there
might
be
a
problem
here
with
this
respondent.
all
that
goes
to
is
the
legitimacy
of
this
investigation.
this
is
not,
this
wasn't
a
research
project,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
certainly
would
enhance,
it
would
bring
the
service,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
sir,
to
first
base.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
indeed,
but
of
course
he
hadn't
filed
any
tax
returns
at
all,
so
it's
possible
he
didn't
want
the
internal
revenue
service
to
know
how
much
money
he
had
earned.
he
was
a
tax
return
preparer,
so
--
(laughter.)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
he's
not
the
kind
of
person
who
is
innocent
of
learning
in
these
matters.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he's
here
ifp.
i
cannot
explain
that.
but
getting
back
to
this
business
about
creating
the
materials,
even
apart
from
the
question,
i
don't
think
that,
you
know,
displaying
a
physical
characteristic
is
a
creation
of
any
evidence
but
rather
recordation
of
something
that
really
exists.
there
also
is
settled
authority
that
section
7602,
the
summons
enforcement
authority,
includes
the
right
to
have
the
service
summon
client
lists
of
tax
return
preparers.
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
in
existence
or
not,
those
cases
are
firmly
established
in
the
circuits,
and
in
fact,
were
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
bisceglia
at
page
148
of
the
opinion.
so
here,
i
think
that
the
concerns
of
the
court,
the
constitutional
concerns
are
groundless
and
the
statutory
concerns,
i
think
from
a
matter
of
sort
of
textural
analysis
of
the
statute
as
well
as
policy
concerns
are
groundless.
the
respondent
here
has
sufficient
protections
to
be
able
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
summons
or
a
respondent
as
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
problem
in
the
litigation,
apparently,
just
began
to
surface
about
four
or
five
years
ago
when
people
began
to
object.
there
has
been
some
voluntary
compliance.
and
i
asked
the
internal
revenue
service
how
long
they
had
been
getting
handwriting
exemplars
and
they
have
a
standard
form,
and
i
was
told
that
the
treasury
department
had
been
requiring
this
information
as
early
as
1921.
from
1921
until
1973,
the
handwriting
analysis
was
done
by
the
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
tax
branch
of
the
irs
which
i
think
now
has
been
moved
to
the
justice
department.
but
the
service
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
they've
been
requesting
where
cases
make
it
appropriate
to
request.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
not
aware
of
any
litigation
or
enforcement
proceedings
until
the
mid-1970's
when
this
started
to
become
a
problem.
in
fact,
the
only
cases
of
appellate
rank
are
campbell,
this
case,
rosinsky,
and
i
think
there's
one
other
fourth
circuit
case
that
sore
of
created
the
conflict.
but
we
don't
really,
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
lend
support
to
our
submission
that
the
statute
embraces
these
non-testimonial
disclosures
since
there's
no
constitutional
or
policy
reason
to
read
the
statute
in
a
way
which
is
inhospitable
with
this
with
these
purposes.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
think
that
the
words
"other
data"
further
support
our
submission
that
the
statute
covers
these
kinds
of
exemplars.
but
i
think
the
stronger
argument
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
service
has
the
authority
to
make
someone
come
and
appear.
i
think
that
the
6th
circuit
in
brown
misread
the
legislative
history
in
two
different
ways,
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
they,
it
misread
it
by
suggesting
that
the
word
"other
data"
was
added
to
a
transferee
liability
provision
and
in
fact
it
was
not,
and
then
it
also
we
think
narrowly
focused
on
simply
one
of
the
three
legs
of
the
antecedents
of
section
7602
and
made
something
about
the
fact
that,
you
know,
"memoranda"
became
"other
data,"
so
that
must
necessarily
mean
"memoranda."
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
words
books,
papers,
et
cetera,
more
or
less
would
cover
memoranda
and
that
other
data
is
a
word
of
general
import
that
would
cover
information
of
any
kind.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
i
think
that's
right.
we
set
it
forth
in
our
brief,
it's
detailed
information
of
any
kind
or
material
for
an
investigation.
certainly
i
think
it
would
fit
any
kind
of
constitutionally
admissible,
permissible
evidence,
like
handwriting
exemplars
or
voice,
and
so
forth.
may
i
simply
say
one
thing
in
pursuing
your
--
may
i
make
a
correction
in
our
brief
which
i
have
just
discovered
this
morning,
that
footnote
on
page
36,
footnote
7,
which
cites
a
senate
report,
in
the
second
paragraph,
senate
report
no.
558,
73rd
congress,
2nd
sess.,
it
says
623
and
that
should
be
48-49.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
it
would
be
hard
to
find.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add,
if
there
are
no
questions.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
have
nothing
further,
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
