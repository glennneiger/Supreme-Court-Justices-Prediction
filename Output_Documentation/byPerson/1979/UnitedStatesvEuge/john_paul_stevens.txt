mr.
smith,
mr.
euge
is
here
on
an
in
forma
pauperis
basis,
isn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
does
this
statute
authorize
taking
fingerprints?
justice
john
paul
stevens
blood
samples?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
blood
samples,
voice
exemplars?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
those
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
power
used
in
connection
with
preparation
of
criminal
cases
or
just
civil
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
these
exemplars
showed
that
it
was
the
same
person
who
signed
his
name
on
all
these
accounts,
it
would
be
pretty
clear
criminal
liability,
wouldn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
service
has
a
real
problem
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
as
a
member
of
the
bar
satisfied
that
he
fulfills
the
ifp
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
are
dealing
here
specifically
with
the
provisions
of
7602,
are
we
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
that
you
that
if
congress
had
provided
in
that
section
that
the
internal
revenue
service
could
require
the
production
of
handwriting
exemplars,
you
would
not
be
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
am
asking
whether
he
could
be
compelled
to
produce
the
--
or
retrieve
the
raw
data.
