justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you're
arguing
is
basically
a
statutory
question,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
mara
and
dionisio
establish
that
if
congress
says
so,
there
is
no
constitutional
objection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
most
people
only
have
one
social
security
number.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
service
has
a
real
problem,
doesn't
it,
in
the
case
of
kids
going
to
college
and
working
for
the
summer
whose
wages
are
withheld
during
the
time
they
work,
but
they
don't
work
a
long
enough
period
to
be
required
to
pay
any
tax,
and
so
they're
just
literally
thousands
of
legitimate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
kids
have
been
--
you
do
an
awful
lot
of
paper
work
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
his
testimony
as
to
his
net
worth
at
the
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
nonetheless
allowed
him
to
proceed
ifp?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
would
have
no
more
power
to
enforce
the
summons
than
the
service
had
to
issue
the
summons.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
say
that
the
district
court
could
do
something
that
the
service
could
not
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
erwin,
supposing
that
under
section
7602
the
last
sentence
of
it,
and
to
give
such
testimony
under
oath
before
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
at
a
time
and
place
named
in
the
summons
and
to
produce
such
books,
papers,
records
or
other
data
and
to
give
such
testimony
under
oath
as
may
be
relevant
or
material
to
such
inquiry.
and
the
secretary's
delegate
decides
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
us
and
material
and
relevant
for
us
to
have
a
statement
from
you
of
your
net
worth
on
january
1st
and
your
net
worth
on
december
31st,
and
the
man
responds
"i
don't
have
any
such
thing
in
existence."
do
you
think
the
secretary
could
say,
well,
give
us
your
best
estimate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
doubt
it
for
a
minute
if
he
came
within
the
fifth
amendment.
but
do
you
think
it
is
not
authorized
by
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
they
are
asking
for
here
is
to
write
it
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
he
could
be
asked
what
his
net
worth
was
on
january
1st
and
on
december
31st,
but
he
could
not
be
asked
to
write
out
what
his
net
worth
was
on
january
1st
and
december
31st?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
said
in
response
to
the
same
question
that
we
have
been
talking
about,
it
is
all
on
a
data
processing
system
in
my
office
and
i
just
don't
have
any
recollection
of
it,
and
the
people
in
the
service
say,
well,
we
have
no
way
of
getting
into
your
data
processing
machine,
would
you
just
wrote
out
the
summary
of
the
net
worth
or
name
or
whatever
it
is
as
of
january
1st
and
as
of
january
31st?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
if
congress
abolished
grand
juries,
that
law
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
somehow
the
guarantee
that
justice
stewart
has
commented
upon,
upon
the
right
of
every
person
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
constitutionalizes
the
right
of
the
grand
jury
in
a
way
that
favors
the
government
over
an
act
of
congress
which
authorizes
the
service
to
do
something.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
second
circuit
held
that
it
applied
to
computer
tapes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
responded,
euge,
lived
in
saint
louis
missouri.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
been
conducting
investigation
of
his
income
tax
liabilities
for
the
years
1973
to
1976.
the
investigating
agent
attempted
to
determine
whether
a
number
of
bank
accounts
were
being
maintained
by
him
under
different
aliases.
to
assist
in
this
determination,
the
service
issues
summons
requesting
him
to
appear
and
execute
samples
of
this
handwriting.
when
he
refused
to
provide
the
samples,
the
service
brought
an
action
federal
district
court
seeking
enforcement
of
the
sum.
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
summon
should
be
enforced,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
that
order,
concluding
that
congress
had
not
authorized
the
internal
revenue
service
issue
as
summons
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
handwriting
samples.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
find
that
the
internal
revenue
service
code
does
have
statutory
authority
and
confers
it
on
the
service
under
26
u.s.c.
7602
to
issue
us
summons
compelling
the
execution
of
handwriting
samples.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
