we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
v.
euge.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
federal
statute
or
--
well,
we'll
start
with
federal.
is
there
any
federal
statute
that
prevents
you
or
me
or
anyone
from
having
10
bank
accounts
in
10
different
names,
trade
names
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
by
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
answer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is,
i
take
it
from
your
response
to
my
earlier
question
that
there
is
no
statute
which
forbids
any
person
from
having
ten
different
bank
accounts
in
ten
different
names?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
prompted
by
mr.
justice
marshall's
point
that
revealing
that
you
had
ten
different
bank
accounts
under
ten
different
names
is
not
automatically
an
admission
of
any
guilt
of
any
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
do
that
so
that
your
children
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
he
might
come
in
and
explain
that
he
just
didn't
want
his
wife
and
his
children
to
know
how
much
money
he
had
in
the
bank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
erwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
couldn't
afford
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
maybe
there
is
$60,000
in
there
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
just
as
inferable
as
there
is
nothing
in
there
at
this
point.00
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
to
that
is
in
the
framework
of
the
tax
code,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
generally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
is
ordered
to
produce
an
exemplar
in
the
proceeding
by
the
district
court,
where
does
the
compulsion
originate?
is
not
the
court
acting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn't
depend
on
the
internal
revenue
code.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
not.
thank
you,
gentleman,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
78-1453,
united
states
against
euge
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
