mr.
james
w.
erwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
erwin,
counsel
for
the
respondent
harvey
f.
euge.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
congress
has
authorized
the
use
of
an
administrative
summons
to
compel
the
creation
of
physical
or
real
evidence,
in
this
particular
case
handwriting
exemplars,
in
the
administrative
investigation
of
tax
liability.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
in
its
legislative
history
or
in
the
antecedents
of
the
statute
to
which
the
legislative
history
makes
reference
which
supports
that
view.
the
government
relies
upon
two
words
or
phrases
that
appear
in
the
statute,
the
first
of
which
is
"appear."
the
power
to
compel
a
person
to
appear
and
give
testimony,
or
compel
a
person
to
appear
and
produce
books,
papers,
records,
and
other
data.
we
believe
that
the
word
"appear"
merely
has
reference
to
compelling
a
person
to
respond
to
the
summons.
this
is
in
accord
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
agent
who
issues
a
summons
is
conducting
a
tax
investigation.
therefore
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
default
in
the
ordinary
case
of
where
monetary
or
equitable
relief,
he
needs
to
have
a
response.
a
person
must
either
comply
with
the
summons
or
he
must
appear
and
make
whatever
good
faith
defense
he
may
have
to
it.
the
statutory
structure
is
likewise
set
up
in
this
way.
section
7604(b),
to
which
this
court
had
reference
in
the
kaplan
case
in
1964,
noted
that
it
was
only
for
the
use
of
a
person
wholly
defaulted
or
contumaciously
refused
to
comply
with
the
summons.
in
fact,
this
was
a
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
mr.
euge
initially
failed
to
appear
before
the
revenue
agent
in
response
to
the
summons
and
he
initially
failed
to
appear
before
the
district
court
in
response
to
an
order
to
show
cause,
and
an
attachment
for
his
arrest
was
issued
under
section
7604(b)
and
he
was
brought
before
the
court
and
the
case
eventually
proceeded
to
a
hearing.
incidentally,
at
the
time
that
he
was
brought
before
the
court,
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
his
financial
ability
to
retain
counsel.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
there
was.
it
is
not
included
in
the
appendix,
but
there
is
a
transcript
of
it
that
was
included
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
pardon
me?
mr.
james
w.
erwin
the
agent
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
had
determined
that
in
the
year
1975
$30,000
had
passed
through
the
account,
and
in
1976
$50,000.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
your
honor,
this
was
at
a
time
two
years,
about
two
years
before
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
his
financial
condition.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
he
did
not
testify.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
he
testified
that
his
assets
were
tied
up
in
real
estate
which
were
subject
to
foreclosure
in
proceedings
by
the
redevelopment
authority
in
st.
louis
for
failure
to
pay
city
taxes.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
i
am,
sir.
i
think
it
is,
further
significant
that
the
statute
does
not
use
the
broadest
possible
language
that
it
could
in
setting
forth
the
scope
of
the
summons.
for
example,
it
does
not
say
that
a
person
could
be
compelled
to
appear
and
give
evidence
of
any
kind.
evidence,
of
course,
includes
not
only
testimony
and
oral
statements
under
oath
but
the
production
of
documentary
evidence,
books,
papers,
and
records,
but
also
real
and
physical
evidence,
handwriting
exemplars,
fingerprints,
summaries,
charts,
many
things
that
can
be
used
as
evidence
in
a
trial.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
do
not
agree.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
believe
that
the
point
on
which
the
statute
addresses
itself,
he
could
be
compelled
to
produce
documents
or
evidence
of
a
documentary
nature
that
does
exist.
a
picture
would
be
an
example
of
that.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
no,
not
generally.
i
think
that
a
grand
jury
or
a
court
has
inherent
power
to
compel
production
of
evidence
which
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
have.
the
internal
revenue
service
power
is
statutory
and
it
has
only
that
power
which
--
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
the
court
is
acting
but
it
is
acting
pursuant
to
the
statute.
there
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
that
is
worded
in
the
same
words
as
the
scope
of
the
summons
power,
section
7402(b)
and
also
section
7604(a),
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court
to
enforce
a
summons
for
the
production
of
books,
papers,
records,
and
other
data.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
the
district
court
in
a
pending
criminal
case
pursuant
to
a
motion
of
the
government
could
order
the
execution
of
the
handwriting
exemplar
or
it
could
order
the
enforcement
of
a
grand
jury
subpoena
for
handwriting
exemplar.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
no,
it
does
not,
but
its
power
in
this
particular
type
of
case
does
depend
upon
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
no,
sir,
i
have
not
considered
that.
the
other
portion
of
the
statute
which
the
government
makes
reference
to
in
their
brief
is
that
part
which
states
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
the
power
to
summon
books,
papers,
records
and
other
data.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
is
very
simple.
it
is,
just
one
sentence,
and
it
states
that
the
section
was
not
intended
--
it
was
intended
to
enact
no
material
change
from
existing
law.
existing
law
in
1964,
of
course,
was
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
which
was
itself
a
codification
of
previous
internal
revenue
acts.
the
three
statutes
which
set
forth
the
scope
of
the
summons
in
the
1939
code
are
section
3614,
section
3615
and
section
3654.
section
3614(a)
refers
to
the
examination
of
books,
papers,
records,
or
memorandum;
section
3615(a)
refers
to
summons
for
production
of
books;
and
section
3654(a)
refers
to
examination
of
books,
papers,
accounts
and
premises
in
the
summoning
of
books
and
papers.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
believe
in
that
situation
the
person
would
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
refuse
to
respond.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
the
taking
of
testimony
from
the
taxpayer
is
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
the
taking
of
oral
statements
under
oath,
the
statute
specifically
authorizes
that
in
subsection
3.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
don't
believe
the
statute
authorizes
them
to
compel
the
creation
of
a
document.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
that
is
our
position.
however,
they
could
summon
documents
which
would
reflect
that.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
think
not,
your
honor,
if
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
a
handwriting
exemplar.
i
might
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
testimony
under
oath
i
think
refers
to
oral
testimony.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
in
the
production
of
evidence,
production
of
documentary
type
evidence,
books,
papers
and
records.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
he
could
not
be
compelled
to
produce
or
create
those
documents
affirmatively
by
the
service.
and
at
least
until
the
mid-1970's
believe
the
service
itself
recognized
that.
we
cite
it
in
our
briefs
and
administrative
regulations,
where
they
stated
that
the
person
was
not
to
be
required
to
produce
summaries
or
lists,
that
that
was
a
job
for
the
agent
based
upon
the
testimony
that
he
may
have
taken
or
the
documents
that
have
been
produced
at
the
hearing.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
again
i
do
not
think
they
could
be
compelled
to
create
that
document.
now,
if
it
exists
on
computer
tape,
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
v.
davey
has
said
that
a
computer
tape
which
contains
those
types
of
records
is
other
data
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
if
that
is
in
existence.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
the
data
case
involved
the
production
of
the
actual
tape
itself
rather
than
the
retrieval
of
the
data.
i
think
most
persons
would
rather
retrieve
the
data
voluntarily
than
turn
over
the
tape
if
that
is
the
only
record
they
have.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
think
this
is
a
transformation
of
existing
information
that
is
capable,
that
does
exist,
is
in
existing
records
and
cannot
be
read
by
human
beings,
of
course,
and
must
be
transformed
into
a
printout
in
order
to
be
read
by
persons.
getting
back
to
the
1939
code,
i
think
it
is
also
significant
that
the
provision
in
the
code
relating
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
enforce
a
summons
states
that
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
enforce
a
summons
to
produce
books,
papers
or
other
data.
this
is
the
very
phrase
that
occurs
in
section
7602.
this
phrase
was
inserted
in
the
code
in
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
the
tax
code
in
1919,
the
internal
revenue
act
that
was
enacted
then.
it
was
subsequently
reenacted
several
times
through
1939,
it
appears
in
section
3633(a)
of
the
1939
code
and
is
presently
section
7402(b)
of
the
1954
code.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
a
comparison
of
the
jurisdictional
statute
with
those
statutes
which
set
forth
the
scope
of
the
summons
under
the
1939
code
and
prior
internal
revenue
laws
that
other
data
is
a
catch-all
term
that
refers
to
items
of
like
kind
and
nature
as
set
forth.
it
does
not
specify
records
or
memoranda
or
accounts
which
are
set
forth
in
the
scope
of
the
summons
power.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes.
well,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
the
grand
jury
analogy,
which
mr.
smith
has
made
reference
to,
is
complete
in
this
type
of
case,
that
the
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
internal
revenue
agent
the
same
power
that
the
grand
jury
has.
i
believe
that
that
is
not
correct,
that
the
grand
jury
and
the
internal
revenue
agent
stand
on
different
footing,
and
while
the
analogy
does
have
force
in
certain
situations,
it
does
not
have
force
in
this
particular
situation.
first
of
all,
a
grand
jury,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case,
is
a
creature
of
the
constitution.
the
internal
revenue
service
is
a
statutory
body.
it
does
not
have
inherent
power
as
a
grand
jury
does
to
compel
the
production
of
all
types
of
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
i
believe
it
does
in
practically
those
very
words,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
therefore
it
could
not
be
abolished.
there
may
be
restrictions
placed
upon
it,
but
it
could
not
be
abolished.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
right.
the
functions
of
the
grand
jury
are
not
the
same
as
the
special
agent's
function,
as
the
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
there
is
a
similarity
and
both
of
them
--
mr.
james
w.
erwin
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
grand
jury
has
inherent
power
such
as
the
court
does
in
a
pending
criminal
case
to
order
the
production
of
this
type
of
evidence.
as
contrasted
to
the
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
which
is
statutory,
and
if
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
that
power,
no
matter
how
much
they
would
like
to
have
it
or
might
need
it,
they
do
not
have
it,
and
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
grand
jury
has
two
functions
historically.
one
is
the
investigative
function
which
the
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
also
has.
the
other
is
to
function
as
a
protection
of
citizens
of
the
prosecutorial
arm
of
the
government.
this
is
not
something
that
is
shared
by
the
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
true,
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
actually
prosecute
the
case
if
it
comes
to
trial,
but
certainly
they
are
aligned
with
the
prosecution
and
they
investigate,
prepare
the
case
and
make
recommendations.
frequently
agents
or
other
employees
of
the
internal
revenue
service
participate
in
grand
jury
proceedings
for
technical
assistance
and
they
frequently
provide
expert
witnesses
at
a
criminal
trial.
finally,
there
is
no
neutral
supervision
of
the
issuance
of
a
summons
prior
to
its
issuance
except
in
very
limited
cases
as
set
forth
in
section
7609.
there
is
supervision
if
the
taxpayer
objects,
in
which
case
it
goes
to
the
district
court
and
the
matter
is
reviewed.
it
appears
that
this
does
not
occur
very
often.
taking
the
government's
statistics
from
their
briefs,
in
an
18-month
period
ending
in
december
'78,
it
said
that
handwriting
exemplars
were
used
in
320
cases.
our
research
has
turned
up
only
about
10
cases
reported
and
unreported
in
which
the
use
of
a
summons
was
reviewed.
so
it
is
less
than
five
percent
of
the
cases
have
reviewed
the
use
of
summons
for
handwriting
exemplars,
and
this
is
in
a
situation
where
there
is
enough
doubt
about
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
even
has
the
power
that
is
required
for
resolution
by
this
court.
it
may
be
that
the
experience
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
such
that
it
has
revealed
the
need
to
be
able
to
use
administrative
summons
to
obtain
handwriting
exemplars
or
voice
exemplars
or
perhaps
in
exceptional
cases
fingerprints,
i
believe
even
blood
samples
were
mentioned.
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
present
statute
does
not
authorize
that.
it
is
an
old
statute
that
goes
back
many
years.
there
was
an
existing
practice
at
the
time
that
the
present
statute
was
enacted,
a
practice
that
had
been
in
existence
since
the
19th
century
for
the
production
of
documentary
evidence,
which
is
the
usual
type
of
evidence
used
in
a
tax
case,
whether
civil
or
criminal.
it
may
be
that
the
statute
to
that
extent
was
obsolete
and
it
needs
changing.
mr.
james
w.
erwin
yes,
and
because
they
were
presently
in
existence
and
they
made
reference
to
the
brown
case
and
said
that
it
only
applied
to
documents
which
were
presently
in
existence
and
agreed
with
that
position
of
the
brown
case
which
relied
primarily
on
canons
of
statutory
construction
which
is
essentially
what
we
have
been
arguing
in
this
case.
but
it
did
not
say
that
they
had
the
power
to
compel
the
production
of
documents
or
lists
or
summaries
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
summons
was
issued.
indeed,
i
think
this
case
made
that
limitation
for
third
party
summons
which
uses
the
same
language
as
section
7602
when
directed
towards
a
third
party
record-keeper
to
require
them
not
to
just
turn
over
what
records
they
may
have
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
but
to
prepare
lists
or
summaries
of
analyses
and
so
forth
presently
not
having
to
do.
if
the
service
needs
the
power
to
compel
the
execution
of
handwriting
exemplars
or
to
compel
the
production
of
other
real
or
physical
evidence,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
forum
for
addressing
that
is
congress
which,
after
all,
is
the
body
which
has
enacted
the
statute
and
given
them
power
to
issue
the
summons
in
the
first
place.
it
is
our
position
that
the
summons
power
should
not
be
enlarged
by
this
court
under
the
guise
of
statutory
construction
to
include
within
its
scope
that
which
congress
has
excluded,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
