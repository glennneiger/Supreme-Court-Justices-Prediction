wasn't
it?

i
have
a
question,
mr.
smith.
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
you
are
making
neither
pro
nor
con
out
of
the
change
in
the
one
word,
"data,"
to
the
one
word,
"memorandum,"
or
vice
versa
in
the
39
to
the
present
code?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
one
you
make.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say

much

involved

these
side
accounts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
much

mr.
erwin,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
the
bisceglia
case.
do
you
feel
there
are
no
implications
in
that
decision
that
are
adverse
to
your
position
here?
you
cite
it
only
twice,
once
to
the
dissenting
opinion
and
once
to
the
ensuing
curative
legislation.
