justice

mr.
smith,
is
your
argument
then,
you
are
not
arguing
that
the
handwriting
exemplar
is
testimony.
in
fact,
i
guess
it's
not
testimony
under
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
given
the
power
to
take
testimony
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
claim,
then,
that
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute
covers
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
smith,
i
know
you
discuss
in
your
brief
but
i
just
don't
remember,
how
old
is
this
problem?
how
long
has
this
problem
been
a
matter
of
debate
between
--
justice
byron
r.
white
practiced
since
1921,
suddenly
they're
requiring
or
just
requesting,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
there
been
enforcement
proceedings,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
harder
to
say
that
exemplars
are
memoranda
than
it
is
to
say
that
they
are
data?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
much
of
a
mistake,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
fairly
minor.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree,
as
suggested
by
your
brother,
that
he
could
be
summoned
to
appear
for
the
purpose
of
having
his
picture
taken?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
be
summoned
to
appear
and
bring
with
him
an
existing
picture,
couldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
erwin,
i
know
the
government
doesn't
argue
this,
but
have
you
considered
whether
the
analogy
of
the
new
york
telephone
case,
whether
the
all
writs
act
would
give
the
court
the
power
to
aid
the
jurisdiction
to
order
production
of
this
kind
of
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
make
it
even
more
simple.
let's
forget
about
net
worth.
suppose
he
came
in
and
put
him
under
oath
and
asked
his
name
and
he
said,
whatever
it
is,
euge,
and
he
said
let's
have
you
write
it
out.
would
that
be
proper
on
the
part
of
the
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
speak
of
oral
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
line,
supposing
they
asked
him
for
a
list
of
his
receipts
by
month
for
the
past
twelve
months
and
a
list
of
expenditures
and
a
profit
and
loss
statement
and
a
balance
sheet,
none
of
which
he
had
prepared.
could
they
do
you
think
say,
well,
you
could
tell
us
all
of
this
orally
but
we
would
like
you
to
prepare
it
in
writing
so
it
is
much
more
manageable
for
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
compel
the
retrieval
of
raw
data
in
the
computer?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
constitution
assures
every
defendant
in
a
federal
criminal
case
that
he
can't
be
tried
unless
he
is
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
constitutional,
but
nobody
could
be
tried
in
a
federal
criminal
court.
