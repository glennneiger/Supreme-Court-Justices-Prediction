mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
brought
before
this
most
honorable
court
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
discharged
from
public
office
because
he
chose
to
exercise
his
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
no,
sir.
before
delving
any
further
into
the
issues
of
the
case
i
would
like
to
state
some
of
the
facts.
petitioner
had
been
--
as
it
is
reflected
in
exhibit
1
of
his
complaint
--
had
been
engaged
for
about
two
years
in
a
constant
vortex
of
several
problems
concerning
his
fellow
officers.
he
accused
some
of
them
of
fabricating
cases,
using
false
witness.
he
suffered
emotional
problems
himself
which
affected
him
in
his
work
professionally.
he
was
not
discharged
then
because
of
that.
he
pressed
charge
against
his
fellow
officers,
he
interfered
with
the
bureau
of
inspection
services
investigation.
he
charged
that
some
of
his
fellow
officers
had
gained
entry
into
the
police
through
illegal
means.
then
some
of
his
fellow
officers
in
turn
accused
him
that
he
was
maligning
them
--
many
of
them,
about
four
of
them.
they
questioned
his
reputation,
they
accused
him
of
tampering
with
a
witness
and
he
was
not
discharged
then.
he
was
accused
of
passing
information
to
the
defense
of
a
notorious
criminal,
he
was
accused
of
supplying
information
to
out-of-town
killers
in
order
that
they
could
prepare
their
defense.
he
was
accused
of
creating
problems,
internal
problems
in
the
police
as
to
help
underworld
figures.
he
was
accused
of
having
suspicious
person
in
his
own
house.
he
was
not
discharged
then.
the
fact
is
that
an
impartial
investigation
was
carried
on
by
the
police
itself
and
he
was
cleared.
he
was
transferred
because
he
could
not
properly
work
in
this
unwholesome
environment,
surrounded
by
so
many
people
who
he
had
accused
and
who
had
accused
him
in
turn,
he
was
transferred
to
the
police
headquarters
and
to
the
police
academy.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
well,
it
has
been
said
here
that
his
right
of
freedom
of
speech
had
been
violated.
that
was
not
pleaded
directly
and
so
he
did
not
state
a
violation
to
the
first
amendment
at
a
district
court.
this
was
not
before
the
district
court
and
was
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so
it
should
not
be
before
this
court.
and
that
wasn't
an
element
of
pleading.
he
was
not
discharged
either
when
he
testified
in
the
criminal
case
against
his
own
supervisor,
underlining
his
authority
or
when
criminal
charges
were
brought
against
him
for
wiretapping
of
his
fellow
officers
in
conversations
concerning
official
matters.
he
was
discharged
two
months
afterwards,
after
three
years
of
all
this
when
it
came
apparent
to
the
superintendent
of
police
that
his
conduct
was
injurious
and
harming
to
the
police
department.
so
i
say
that
in
justice
it
couldn't
be
said
that
he
was
arbitrarily
discharged
as
he
actually
pleaded
in
his
complaint.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
mainly
because
of
a
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
he
did
not
plead
any
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
and
i
deem
that
the
logic
would
justify
on
the
plaintiff
the
absence
of
such
bad
faith
on
the
defendant
is
that
otherwise
defendant
would
not
have
been
liable
for
damages.
so
we
have
the
concurrence
of
that
very
bad
faith,
linked
it
with
valid
cause
of
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
discharge
from
employment
does
not
entitle
anyone
to
recover
from
damages
under
civil
rights
action.
bad
faith,
malice
or
recklessness,
such
circumstances
actually
constitute
elements
of
any
valid
claim
for
relief,
simply
because
in
their
absence
the
pleader
would
not
be
entitled
at
all
to
the
relief
requested.
i
would
like
to
bring
your
attention
to
the
opinion
delivered
this
very
morning
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
case
of
owen
v.
the
city
of
independence
where
on
page
2
it
says.
"where
an
immunity
was
well
established
at
common
law
and
where
its
rationale
was
compatible
with
the
purpose
of
1983
this
has
been
construed
to
incorporate
that
immunity."
the
same
page
establishes
that
police
officers
actually
enjoy
that
immunity.
the
purpose
of
pleading
is
to
inform
about
the
essence
of
the
claim
and
the
ground
on
which
it
rests,
to
indicate
the
basis
upon
which
relief
is
sought.
and
so
no
one
should
be
required
to
put
forward
a
defense
against
minor
imputations
which
have
not
even
been
formulated
or
articulated
or
to
state
his
position
concerning
possible
or
probable
issues
which
have
not
been
raised
yet
in
a
case
against
him.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
it
is
a
qualified
immunity.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
because
of
the
very
position.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
would
have
claimed
that
regardless
of
defendant
being
a
police
officer
the
immunity
did
not
apply
to
him
because
he
had
acted
in
bad
faith.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
think
this
is
main
point
on
which
the
defense
rests.
we
don't
negate
all
the
other
elements
of
the
violation.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
very
valid
defense.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
no,
i
would
not
say
so.
i
would
say
that
that
is
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
yes.
i
would
say
that
he
would
have
to
be
very
specific
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
well
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
think
he
should
know
about
it,
since
he
is
actually
pleading
that
it
was
implied
in
the
allegations.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
before
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
argued
that
though
they
had
not
pleaded
bad
faith
in
those
many
words,
it
was
actually
implied
in
the
allegations.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
that
is
correct.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
that
is
my
position.
well,
first
i
think
that
it
should
be
pleaded.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
well,
why
crossing
the
bridge
before
you
get
to
the
river?
we
are
at
this
stage
of
the
pleading,
the
case
was
dismissed
because
it
had
not
been
pleaded
properly,
not
because
of
any
consideration
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
would
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
i
would
ask
from
him
to
anticipate
and
at
least
give
notice
of
what
he
intends
to
say.
that
is
the
purpose
of
pleading,
to
give
notice,
to
inform
as
to
the
essence
--
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
yes,
we
do.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
well,
your
very
case
of
owen
v.
the
city
of
independence,
missouri
covers
that
adequately.
my
personal
opinion
is
that
in
the
face
of
an
immunity
you
would
have
to
plead
an
indication
of
how
that
immunity
would
not
apply.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
yes.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
affirmative,
yes.
now,
concerning
the
due
process
violation
i
would
say
that
considering
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
granted
a
hearing
and
that
he
was
rendered
whole
and
he
was
reinstated,
his
claims
don't
have
any
foundation.
the
fundamental
requirement
of
due
process
is
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time
and
in
a
meaningful
way.
and
decisions
of
this
court
suggests
rather
strongly,
i
would
say,
that
an
employee
who
has
a
hearing
held
after
removal
get
his
due
process,
for
example,
arnett
v.
kennedy.
mr.
federico
cedo
alzamora
it
was
definitely
clear
because
act
26
of
1974
on
which
the
claim
was
based
does
not
provide
for
the
celebration
of
an
evidentiary
trial-type,
formal
administrative
hearing.
it
just
mentions
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
which
in
my
opinion,
could
be
accomplished
by
a
chance
to
file
an
answer.
and
petitioner
has
not
alleged
that
he
was
denied
such
opportunity.
besides,
petitioner
had
a
hearing
and
it
seems
that
the
statute
that
created
the
commission
of
investigation,
prosecutions
and
appeals
of
the
police
provides
that
the
commission
may
confirm,
revoke
or
modify
the
decisions
or
acts
appealed,
it
could
be
said
that
petitioner's
discharge
was
not
in
fact
final
until
its
time
for
an
appeal
had
expired
or
after
15
days
after
being
affirmed
upon
appeal
that
a
commission
reconsideration
was
requested.
so
he
was
granted
his
hearing
before
his
discharge
was
final
and
that
comes
from
the
very
facts
that
were
pleaded.
i
think
the
case
is
very
clear.
thanks
for
your
attention.
