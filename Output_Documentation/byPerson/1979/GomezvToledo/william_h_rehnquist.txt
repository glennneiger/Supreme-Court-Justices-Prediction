justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
passed
the
organic
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
then
that
the
home
rule
act
enacted
by
congress
for
the
district
of
columbia
several
years
ago
made
our
earlier
decision
saving
1983
was
not
applicable
to
the
district
out
of
date
because
now
the
city
council
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
one
that
enacts
the
laws
which
govern
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
eastland
v.
servicemen's
fund
decided
three
or
four
years
ago,
wasn't
there
some
statement
in
there
that
a
mere
letter
from
the
defendant
stating
that
he
was
a
member
of
congress
was
all
that
was
required,
no
pleading
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
still
have
to
say,
i
object.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
plaintiff
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
the
defendant
is
a
judge
and
that
it
is
clear
from
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
the
judge
was
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
as
i
understand
it,
the
requirement
of
intent
to
defame
or
actual
malice
is
a
burden
on
the
plaintiff
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
it
before
it
was
a
commonwealth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
territory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
is
that
so
clear
that
it
could
be
decided
on
the
complaint
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me
right
now,
but
isn't
there
something
in
the
complaint
itself
about
the
conducting
of
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
it
also
say
he
got
one
but
it
was
defective,
or
--
