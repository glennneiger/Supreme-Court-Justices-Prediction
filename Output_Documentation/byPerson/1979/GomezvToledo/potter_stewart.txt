justice
potter
stewart
he
had
to
plead
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
to
pose
a
defense
but
it
is
like
an
insanity
defense
in
some
jurisdictions.
then
the
government
must
prove
insanity.
justice
potter
stewart
pleading
is
the
only
thing
that
is
here.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
avery,
i
think
before
you
sit
down,
perhaps
i
should
have
looked
at
1983
before
i
asked
you
the
question
i
did
whether
puerto
rico
is
a
state,
the
statute
reads.
"every
person
under
color
of
any
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom
or
usage
of
any
state
or
territory"
--so
i
gather
it
is
under
1983,
because
puerto
rico
is
a
territory.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
right,
then.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
commonwealth,
it
is
a
commonwealth
by
congressional
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
any
cases
that
have
addressed
directly
the
question
whether
puerto
rico
comes
within
1983,
and
why?
justice
potter
stewart
supposing
you
had
a
complaint
in
which
there
were
two
defendants,
one
a
municipality
and
the
other
the
chief
of
police.
and
say
in
two
counts
with
the
same
transaction
basically
in
both.
would
you
say
that
there
must
be
pleading
of
bad
faith
in
the
count
against
the
municipality?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
agree
that
under
owen
there
would
be
no
necessity
of
pleading
bad
faith
against
the
municipality?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
say
there
is
an
additional
element
in
the
cause
of
action
against
the
individual?
