william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
avery,
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
you
a
question
at
the
threshold.
has
this
court
ever
decided
that
puerto
rico
was
a
state
for
purposes
of
1983?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
has
the
issue
ever
been
before
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
that
it
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
we
can
take
cognizance
of,
isn't
it?
if
it
is
not,
then
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
has
been
the
rationale
of
the
first
circuit,
to
suggest
that
it
is
a
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
a
constitutional
matter
though,
is
it?
congress
has
created
something
called
a
commonwealth
but
i
suppose
for
the
purposes
of
the
constitution
it
is
a
territorial
clause
that
applies,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
has
the
first
circuit
said
is
the
basis
for
a
conclusion
that
actions
against
puerto
rican
officials
lie
under
1983?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
puerto
rico
is
a
territory.
