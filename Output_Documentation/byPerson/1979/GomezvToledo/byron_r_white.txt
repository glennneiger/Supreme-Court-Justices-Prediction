justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
are
aware,
this
court
has
held
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
state
for
purposes
of
1983.
and
at
least
i
take
it
constitutionally
puerto
rico
is
a
territory,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
there
been
any
rulings
with
respect
to
1981
or
1982
about
puerto
rico?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
all
matters
of
immunity
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
absolute
immunity
for
--
legislative
immunity,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
plead
the
immunity,
to
establish
that
what
was
going
on
there
was
legislative.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
failure
to
take
a
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tenney
v.
brandhove
this
court
reinstated
a
district
court
dismissal
of
an
action
where
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
that
they
had
stated
a
cause
of
action.
and
this
court
reversed
and
reinstated
the
dismissal.
and
you
would
think
it
was
because
of
his
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
argue
about
absolute
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
you
think
the
burden
matter
is
even
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
burden
issue
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
the
complaint
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
--
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
wasn't
even
pleaded.
there
would
have
still
been
a
dismissal
just
for
failure
to
plead.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
couldn't
have
been
for
failure
to
prove.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
and
neither
could
the
first
circuit.
so
why
is
the
burden
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
would
seem
to
argue
and
assert
that
is
your
position,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
your
position
in
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
also
true
that
if
the
court
should
ultimately
decide
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
defendant,
then
necessarily
the
burden
of
pleading
would
fall
a
fortiori.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
the
extent
that
you
make
an
argument
favoring
placing
the
burden
of
proof
there
you
are
supporting
an
argument
in
favor
of
placing
the
burden
of
pleading
there
as
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
a
racial
discrimination
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
intentionally.
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
it
has
been
a
commonwealth
for
not
that
many
years,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
1983
would
apply
if
it
were
a
territory
or
if
it
were
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
says,
well,
whatever
it
is,
it
is
somewhere
between
the
two.
