mr.
michael
avery
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
following
the
dismissal
of
petitioner's
1983
action
in
which
he
alleged
that
he
was
discharged
from
public
employment
in
retaliation
for
a
speech
on
his
part
which
we
submit
was
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
without
regard
to
his
due
process
rights
to
procedural
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
avery
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
first
circuit
has
decided
that
on
a
number
of
occasions.
mr.
michael
avery
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
michael
avery
it
is
a
basic
jurisdictional
issue.
it
is
not
disputed
by
any
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
avery
and
i
know
of
no
argument
that
has
been
presented
--
mr.
michael
avery
it
is
not
a
territory
in
a
strict
constitutional
sense
but
it
has
been
treated
as
such
by
the
first
circuit.
it
has
a
sort
of
unique
commonwealth
status
arising
from
the
organic
act
earlier
in
this
--
mr.
michael
avery
that
would
be
our
position
with
regard
to
the
application
of
1983,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
avery
as
i
recall
--
and
you
do
catch
me
somewhat
off
guard,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
the
argument
that
has
been
made
in
this
case
is
that
the
constitution
must
have
meaning
within
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
since
it
is
under
our
jurisdiction.
and
that
1983
is
the
method
for
enforcing
that.
mr.
michael
avery
that
may
very
well
be.
mr.
michael
avery
but
didn't
we
also
say
in
the
opinion
written
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
brennan
covering
the
district
of
columbia
that
congress
enacted
1983
because
it
thought
that
state
legislatures
would
be
considerably
less
receptive
to
federal
constitutional
rights
than
congress
itself
and
that
since
congress
itself
legislated
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
district
of
columbia
was
not
a
state
for
purposes
of
1983.
well,
that
rationale
would
support
the
application
of
1983
to
puerto
rico,
because
congress
does
not
legislate
for
puerto
rico
within
--
in
the
sense
that
it
does
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
michael
avery
yes,
but
the
laws
that
govern
the
people
of
puerto
rico
on
a
day
to
day
basis
are
passed
by
the
puerto
rifo
legislature
in
puerto
rico.
and
in
that
sense
functionally
it
is
in
the
same
position
to
the
federal
constitution
as
a
state
or
territory.
mr.
michael
avery
well,
that
might
be
a
possible
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
to
be
frank
with
you,
i
am
a
little
out
of
my
depth
with
regard
to
the
home
rule
act
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
that
question
adequately.
but
i
would
say
with
regard
to
puerto
rico
that
the
same
concerns
that
prompted
the
1871
civil
rights
act
are
in
effect
there,
namely
is
the
federal
constitution
going
to
be
given
the
same
even-handed
application
by
local
officials
in
that
territory
as
it
is
in
all
the
other
states
and
territories.
and
i
think
that
that
justifies
the
application
of
1983
to
puerto
rico.
mr.
michael
avery
well,
i
accept
your
statement
that
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
puerto
rico
does
have
the
unique
relationship
--
mr.
michael
avery
--
does
have
a
unique
relationship
with
the
united
states.
and
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico
and
the
first
circuit
have
certainly
entertained
these
suits
with
regard
to
puerto
rico
for
a
number
of
years
now.
mr.
michael
avery
i
know
of
no
1981
and
1982
cases.
there
may
very
well
be
such
cases
but
i
personally
don't
know
of
such
cases,
mr.
justice
white.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
purely
for
the
reason
that
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
allege
bad
faith
in
his
complaint
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
pleaded
constitutional
violations
and
he
had
pleaded
that
these
violations
had
transpired
under
color
of
law.
and
our
position
is
that
this
question
presents
two
analytically
different
issues
for
resolution
by
this
court.
one,
who
has
the
burden
of
pleading
matters
relative
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
a
1983
case
and
two,
what
are
the
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983?
in
our
view,
the
fatal
flaw
of
the
first
circuit
decision
is
that
it
merged
these
two
questions
and
decided
both
of
them
incorrectly
by
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
allege
bad
faith
as
an
element
of
his
cause
of
action
under
1983.
if
i
might
turn
to
the
qualified
immunity
issues
first,
this
court
has
decided
we
would
submit
in
scheur
v.
rhodes
that
in
a
series
of
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
the
court
that
the
qualified
immunity
matters
are
matters
of
defense.
although
the
court
has
never
referenced
it
specifically
to
rule
8(c),
we
would
submit
that
the
matters
of
affirmative
defense
under
rule
8(c)
have
been
continuously
referred
to
in
that
way
by
the
court.
mr.
michael
avery
i
think
--
mr.
michael
avery
this
court
has
treated
absolute
immunity
as
a
defense.
in
doe
v.
mcmillan,
for
example,
i
think
the
court
clearly
put
a
burden
on
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
if
--
mr.
michael
avery
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
subordinate
facts,
if
you
will,
that
would
have
justified
absolute
immunity
in
that
case.
and
that
is
part
of
our
argument,
that
if
the
defendant
has
to
do
even
for
absolute
immunity
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
for
qualified
immunity
the
defendant
certainly
has
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
avery
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
other
absolute
immunity
cases
rather
more
than
that
has
been
required
of
the
defendants.
but
even
if
there
are
cases,
for
example
a
judicial
immunity
case
where
the
mere
status
of
the
person
is
a
fairly
complete
answer
to
the
immunity
issue
--
mr.
michael
avery
yes.
and
in
fact
there
are
cases
where
even
the
fact
that
the
person
is
a
judge
won't
insulate
him
from
liability
under
1983
if
he
acts
wholly
beyond
his
judicial
authority.
mr.
michael
avery
i
think
the
judge
would
be
entitled
to
win
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
avery
no,
because
the
immunity
would
be
clear
on
the
fact
of
the
pleadings
and
the
complaint
in
that
sense
would
not
state
a
claim
for
relief.
mr.
michael
avery
well,
i
think
the
plaintiff
states
a
cause
of
action
when
he
alleges
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
and
that
they
have
been
violated
under
color
of
law.
and
our
submission
is
that
the
immunity
matters,
whether
absolute
or
qualified,
are
really
matters
in
confession
and
avoidance.
now,
the
absolute
immunity
cases
are
easy
because
so
often
it
is
obvious
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
what
the
issue
is.
the
qualified
immunity
matters,
however,
fall
into
a
completely
different
--
mr.
michael
avery
no,
i
do
not.
the
qualified
immunity
matters
are
rather
different
and
i
think
this
court
did
decide
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes
that
there
is
no
automatic
assumption
of
qualified
immunity
even
with
regard
to
the
governor
of
a
state
in
that
case.
that
case
came
here
following
the
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
district
court
and
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
that
that
was
erroneous
for
the
district
court
to
assume
that
good
faith
attached
automatically
and
that
there
was
no
basis
in
in
the
record,
factual
or
otherwise,
to
support
the
automatic
assumption
of
good
faith.
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
complaining
parties
in
that
case
were
entitled
to
be
heard
more
fully
than
was
possible
--
mr.
michael
avery
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow
under
the
federal
--
mr.
michael
avery
this
court
has
not
addressed
the
question
of
who
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
with
regard
to
the
qualified
immunity
matters.
that
issue
has
been
widely
litigated
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
nearly
all
of
the
circuits
outside
the
first
circuit,
all
ten
circuits
outside
the
first
circuit
have
ruled
either
on
the
pleading
or
proof
matter
and
most
of
those
circuits
have
decided
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
not
only
of
pleading
it
but
of
proving
it
as
well.
mr.
michael
avery
there
is
only
one
case
i
know
of
outside
the
first
circuit
and
that
is
cruz
v.
beto
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
they
held
that
the
director
of
a
state-wide
prison
system
did
not
have
that
burden
and
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden.
mr.
michael
avery
he
had
to
raise
it
--
mr.
michael
avery
i
don't
know
if
that
is
an
exact
analogy,
because
the
fifth
circuit
decision
isn't
so
clear,
actually,
about
the
relationship
between
the
pleading
requirement
and
the
proof
requirement.
also
there
seems
to
be
some
disagreement
among
the
various
panels
within
the
fifth
circuit
about
who
has
the
burden.
the
other
circuits
have
pretty
uniformly
held
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
and
the
reason
for
that,
i
would
submit,
is
because
of
very
sound
promising
consideration,
namely
these
matters,
matters
that
go
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
many
cases
are
singularly
within
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant.
there
were
so
many
different
types
of
sources
which
the
defendant
might
turn
to
to
justify
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
the
defense
i
think
both
as
enunciated
by
this
court
and
as
interpreted
by
the
lower
federal
courts
is
very
broad.
defendants
might
look
to
administrative
practice.
they
might
look
to
decided
cases.
they
might
look
to
the
advice
of
counsel.
they
might
look
to
a
manual
that
is
produced
by
the
police
department
or
the
government
that
they
work
for.
plaintiff
simply
has
no
way
of
knowing
at
the
time
he
grants
the
complaint
what
the
defendant's
explanation
for
unconstitutional
conduct
might
be
and
therefore
we
suggest
that
is
only
the
defendant
who
can
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
rule
11
come
forward
and
plead
the
matter.
that
is
true
not
only
because
the
defendant
is
the
only
one
who
would
know
what
the
possible
sources
of
his
good
faith
might
be
but
the
defendant
is
the
only
one
who
would
know
the
circumstances
under
which
he
claims
to
have
developed
some
good
faith
belief
in
the
legality
of
his
action.
for
example,
suppose
the
defendant
relies
upon
advice
of
counsel
and
ultimately
the
defendant's
position
at
trial
is
going
to
be,
my
lawyer
told
me
that
it
was
legal
for
me
to
engage
in
this
act,
which
it
has
turned
out
violates
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
right.
it
is
not
only
the
question
of
what
the
lawyer
told
him
but
what
that
defendant
said
to
the
lawyer.
what
was
the
reason
why
he
sought
advice
from
that
lawyer,
what
information
did
he
give
to
the
lawyer
before
he
asked
the
lawyer
for
an
opinion.
what
question
did
he
finally
put
to
the
lawyer
in
response
to
which
the
lawyer
gave
him
some
advice.
those
are
matters
totally
within
the
control
of
the
defendant's
knowledge
and
the
plaintiff
simply
has
no
information.
mr.
michael
avery
do
you
think
the
--
mr.
michael
avery
yes,
i
do
think
it
is
here,
because
it
seems
to
me
what
the
district
court
and
what
the
first
circuit
decided
was
that
--
mr.
michael
avery
the
complaint
was
dismissed,
yes.
mr.
michael
avery
it
was
dismissed
on
motion
but
the
district
court
really
sua
sponte
raised
this
issue.
mr.
michael
avery
the
dismissal
was
for
failure
to
plead.
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
avery
as
to
burden
of
proof?
well,
that
issue
is
not
here.
i
was
talking
about
that,
mr.
justice
white,
because
you
asked
me
a
question
about
it.
mr.
michael
avery
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
michael
avery
yes,
it
is
our
position
in
our
brief
but
we
do
state
in
the
brief
that
we
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
announce
a
flat
rule
covering
all
1983
cases
as
to
the
allocation
of
that
burden.
just
like
scheuer
v.
rhodes,
the
court
announced
it
would
be
imprudent
to
try
to
cover
the
whole
waterfront
with
regard
to
the
qualified
immunity
--
mr.
michael
avery
the
burden
of
proof?
mr.
michael
avery
i
don't
think
the
court
does
need
to
get
to
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
michael
avery
let
me
apologize
for
my
lack
of
clarity
but
--
mr.
michael
avery
this
is
a
case
about
the
burden
of
pleading.
however
--
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct.
i
only
meant
to
say
that
i
don't
need
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
win
this
case.
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct
also.
this
is
a
case
though
which
is
somewhat
confusing
in
terms
of
what
the
first
circuit
decided,
because
the
first
circuit
appears
to
say
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
its
other
decisions
that
the
reason
they
put
that
burden
on
the
plaintiff
is
as
though
they
consider
pleading
bad
faith
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action.
and
that
is
the
second
half
of
the
analysis
that
the
first
circuit
gives
us,
namely
that
in
order
to
plead
successfully
a
1983
case
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
that
the
defendant
acted
in
bad
faith.
that
is
a
ruling
which
may
very
well,
although
i
just
saw
it
a
few
moments
ago,
be
disposed
of
by
the
court's
decision
today
in
the
owen
case
because
i
take
it
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
could
say
on
the
basis
of
that
is
that
bad
faith
in
the
sense
of
negating
qualified
immunity
can't
be
an
element
of
the
very
cause
of
action
if
that
cause
of
action
can
be
asserted
against
the
municipality
without
making
the
claim
of
negating
qualified
immunity.
it
would
also,
the
first
circuit
decision
viewed
that
way,
it
would
seem
to
me
require
this
court
really
to
overrule
or
at
least
to
do
substantial
damage
to
monroe
v.
pape,
and
carey
v.
piphus,
cases
in
which
this
court
has
in
effect
said
there
were
two
requirements
for
making
out
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
--
(1)
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
and
(2)
a
deprivation
which
takes
place
under
color
of
law.
to
add
a
third
requirement,
namely
that
the
defendant
acted
with
some
malice
or
recklessness
or
bad
faith
in
the
sense
in
which
the
first
circuit
uses
those
terms
would
be
to
add
a
new
requirement
to
--
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct.
there
are
constitutional
violations
that
require
some
mental
element.
mr.
michael
avery
in
pleading
a
defamation
case
such
as
the
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
that
is
correct.
i
think
an
example
of
that
in
this
case
is
the
first
amendment
violation.
under
the
mt.
healthy
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
first
that
he
was
engaged
in
protected
activity
and
it
was
then
in
response
to
his
being
engaged
in
protected
activity
and
it
was
then
in
response
to
his
being
engaged
in
protective
activity
that
the
defendant
discharged
him
from
employment.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
does
have
to
allege
that
a
substantial
factor
or
a
motivating
factor
in
the
defendant's
action
in
discharging
the
plaintiff
was
the
plaintiff's
--
the
content
of
the
plaintiff's
speech.
mr.
michael
avery
and
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
racial
discrimination
case
invidious
discrimination
is
required.
mr.
michael
avery
and
intent,
and
in
an
eighth
amendment
case
some
deliberate
indifference
is
required.
but
those
are
very
specific
requirements
which
the
court
has
developed
as
a
result
of
the
substantive
jurisprudence
of
each
of
those
constitutional
violations.
i
think
in
the
first
amendment
case,
for
example,
we
know
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
as
a
result
of
the
mt.
healthy
decision.
just
to
call
that
bad
faith
or
malice
is
to
muddy
the
waters,
we
would
submit,
because
those
terms
are
much
more
general,
indeed
not
nearly
so
meaningful
as
the
specific
content
of
those
constitutional
rights
which
are
developed
with
regard
to
the
substantive
law
in
those
areas.
in
this
case,
then,
our
submission
is
that
the
plaintiff
had
only
a
responsibility
to
allege
the
substantive
elements
of
the
constitutional
violations
he
was
pleading,
namely
with
regard
to
the
first
amendment
violation
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
speech
activities
which
are
arguably
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
(2)
that
he
was
fired
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
he
engaged
in
that
speech.
and
with
regard
to
the
procedural
due
process
question
that
the
plaintiff
had
employment
in
which
he
had
a
property
right
and
(2)
that
he
was
discharged
without
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
avery
well,
i
say
that
those
are
the
elements
of
those
two
constitutional
violations,
that
the
--
with
regard
to
the
first
amendment
issue
i
think
that
he
has
to
fairly
put
the
defendant
on
notice
that
he
is
claiming
that
he
was
fired
because
of
the
content
of
his
speech
and
i
think
with
regard
to
the
procedural
due
process
issue
he
does
have
to
plead
that
he
lost
his
job
and
that
he
lost
it
without
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
he
has
to
do
any
more
than
that
under
the
notice
pleading
rules.
and
i
think
the
plaintiff
did
that
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
avery
oh
yes,
if
puerto
rico
is
considered
a
territory
it
--
mr.
michael
avery
i
thought
that
was
what
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
was
addressed
to.
mr.
michael
avery
correct
as
i
say,
and
i
am
repeating
myself,
it
has
been
treated
as
a
territory
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
michael
avery
the
commonwealth
status,
if
i
am
not
wrong,
is
in
the
late
'fifties
or
early
'sixties.
mr.
michael
avery
yes.
mr.
michael
avery
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
they
treat
it
as
a
territory.
mr.
michael
avery
it
was,
i
believe,
a
territory.
mr.
michael
avery
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
avery
just
two
points,
if
your
honor
please.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
did
allege
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing,
and
that
allegation
is
supported
by
regulations
which
were
drafted
and
promulgated
by
the
respondent
in
this
very
case.
and
so
it
is
a
case
where
if
he
has
any
good
faith
defense
that
might
even
remotely
or
conceivably
be
imagined,
no
one
other
than
the
respondent
could
possibly
know
what
his
excuse
or
rationale
for
not
following
his
own
regulations
might
be.
and
this
is
a
case
that
in
that
sense
the
burden
definitely
belongs
on
him
to
come
forward
and
escape
from
the
logical
import
of
his
own
regulation.
secondly
--
mr.
michael
avery
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
the
puerto
rico
police
act
of
1974.
mr.
michael
avery
no,
he
didn't
get
a
hearing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
was
an
investigation
by
the
legal
division
of
the
police
department
which
exonerated
the
petitioner.
but
that
wasn't
a
hearing
as
such.
in
fact
the
answer
admits
--
there
was
an
answer
filed
in
this
case
and
it
admits
that
he
was
discharged
without
a
hearing.
he
received
no
hearing.
there
was
an
investigation
by
an
attorney
for
the
legal
department
of
the
police
department
but
not
a
hearing
as
such.
mr.
michael
avery
that
is
correct.
that
was
admitted
in
the
answer.
and
the
second
point
was
that
although
the
petitioner
does
not
use
the
phrase
"first
amendment"
in
the
complaint,
which
is
what
the
respondent
was
referring
to
when
he
spoke
about
the
first
amendment
issue,
the
petitioner
clearly
does
set
forward
the
facts
which
support
a
first
amendment
claim.
and
we
feel
that
really
beyond
doubt
that
the
first
amendment
claim
is
very
much
a
part
of
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
