because
there
is
a
difference
in
the
status
of
the
virgin
islands
and
puerto
rico,
they
aren't
going
to
stand
for
it,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
suggesting
absolute
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
is
the
party
under
1983
to
know
what
immunity
there
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
would
you
allege
it
you
are
a
lawyer,
how
would
you
allege
if
you
want
others
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
defense
would
have
to
take
care
of
in
your
original
pleading?
what
other
defense
would
you
have
to
negate
in
your
original
pleading?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
you
put
in
a
provision
that
says
a
defendant
has
no
valid
defense.
is
that
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
if
the
moving
party
says
and
the
defendant
herein
has
no
valid
defense,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
have
to
be
very
particular,
wouldn't
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
have
to
be
very
specific
about
something
he
didn't
know
anything
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
obliged
to
know
the
immunity
or
lack
of
immunity
that
the
police
officer
has?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
implied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
the
only
way
a
police
officer
can
be
held
liable
under
1983
is
on
proof
of
bad
faith,
affirmative
proof
of
bad
faith?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
plead
it
if
you
don't
have
to
prove
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
you
want
to
do
is
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
river.
you
want
the
moving
party
in
1983
to
take
care
of
all
the
defenses
in
his
pleading.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
just
one
defense.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
discovery
in
puerto
rico?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assumed
so.
thank
you.
