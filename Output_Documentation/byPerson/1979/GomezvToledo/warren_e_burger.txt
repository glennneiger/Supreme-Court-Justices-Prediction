we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
gomez
v.
toledo.
mr.
avery,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
said
that
in
the
fourth
amendment
case,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
that
it
is
a
state,
but
that
the
constitution
is
applicable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
get
to
the
burden
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
are
using
the
term
"burden"
in
two
different
senses,
at
least
for
my
ear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
converse
of
that
is
not
true,
necessarily?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
is
pleading
merely
the
ultimate
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cedo.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
this
bear
on
the
holding
of
the
first
circuit
with
reference
to
the
pleading
question
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
avery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
affirmative
allegation
is
that
his
discharge
was
without
prior
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
