mr.
wiggins,
maybe
it
is
shown
by
the
record,
but
i
didn't
see
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
only
showed
that
she
was
a
former
prostitute.
i
didn't
realize
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
can
we
resolve
it
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
do
we
have
to
wait
until
congress
resolves
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
we?
we
would
be
changing
the
law
in
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
putting
aside
the
confidential
communication,
would
not
the
logic
of
your
argument
equally
apply
to
a
claim
of
privilege
by
the
witness
as
well
as
by
the
defendant?
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
are
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
wouldn't
you
ask
the
court
to
abolish
the
privilege
entirely
except
for
the
confidential
aspects?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
that
reasoning
you
just
gave
would
mean
that
the
public
would
be
able
to
overrule
the
objection
of
the
witness
spouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
denies
the
public
her
testimony
if
she
objects.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
the
spousal
privilege.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
permit
but
could
require.
