justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
congress
do
about
that
suggested
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
congress
do
about
that
suggested
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
came
up
with
one
rule,
501?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
said
that
privilege
shall
be
left
to
the
common
law
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
then
what
congress
has
done
to
date,
that
we
would
be
forbidden
to
overrule
hawkins?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
by
501?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
wouldn't
be
overruling
it
by
proposed
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
2076
deals
with
the
rulemaking
process
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
all
the
evidence
rules
except
privilege
would
just
have
to
--
would
go
into
effect
within
180
days
unless
one
house
or
the
other
acted.
but
any
changes
by
rule
about
privilege,
congress
would
have
to
affirmatively
approve.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
would
be
whether
you
created
a
new
one
or
overruled
an
old
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
decide
a
case
and
then
send
it
over
to
congress
to
see
if
our
decision
should
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
should
we
dismiss
this
case
then
and
say
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
your
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
should
we
summarily
reverse
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
business
tinkering
with
hawkins
in
light
of
2076?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
then
that
privilege
questions
are
just
non-justiciable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
every
application
of
a
privilege
rule
that
would
--
say
there
is
a
conflict
that
develops
between
two
courts
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
privilege
by
either
spouse.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
insofar
as
your
position
involves
any
change
in
the
hawkins
rule,
is
there
any
limitation
on
our
changing
it
under
2076?
justice
byron
r.
white
2076.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
thought
one
proposal
of
the
government
was
that
the
privilege
just
belonged
to
the
witness
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
a
co-conspirator
or
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
which
event
in
your
fifth
circuit
case
there
would
have
been
no
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
proposal
is
that
the
privilege
is
entirely
absent
if
they
are
co-conspirators.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
their
proposal
in
that
regard
to
mean
that
if
the
wife
is
a
co-conspirator
and
there
is
a
prima
facie
showing
of
it,
i
suppose,
as
a
predicate
to
demanding
her
testimony,
she
could
be
made
to
testify
over
her
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
you
have
to
lay
the
predicate
for
a
lot
of
other
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
solicitor
general
seemed
to
indicate
that
maybe
the
court
could
stop
short
of
that
on
the
one
branch
of
their
--
but
as
i
read
their
brief,
it
would
be
to
go
all
the
way.
