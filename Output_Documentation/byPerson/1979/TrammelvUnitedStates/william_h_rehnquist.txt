justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
she
had
implicated
her
husband
at
the
very
first
time
she
was
approached
by
the
government,
would
your
case
be
any
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
spent
considerable
time
pointing
out
the
fact
that
she
took
a
while
to
consent.
i
didn't
see
how
that
was
directly
involved
with
the
legal
principle.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
two
earlier
interviews,
had
she
said
he
did
not
participate
or
had
she
simply
not
said
anything
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
challenging
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be
kind
of
tough
to
conduct
a
contested
divorce
proceeding
if
you
had
this
sort
of
a
privilege
in
civil
litigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
has
to
prove
a
co-conspiracy,
doesn't
it?
it
can't
just
by
naming
someone
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator,
without
any
proof
get
their
testimony.
