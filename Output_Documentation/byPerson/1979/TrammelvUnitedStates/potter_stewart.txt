justice
potter
stewart
well,
rule
501
is
utterly
meaningless
because
it
isn't
left
to
the
common
law
process.
2076
leaves
it
to
the
legislative
process
exclusively.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
501
is
utterly
meaningless.
justice
potter
stewart
say
it
was
4-to-5
between
the
court
of
appeals,
they
just
split
4-to-5.
now,
if
we
decided
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
law
would
be
changed
in
one
group
of
circuits
or
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
it
couldn't
be
changed
until
congress
said
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
can
only
read
you
as
saying
we
should
ignore
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
colorado?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
law
of
colorado?
perhaps
you
have
already
been
asked
this,
but
if
so
i
didn't
get
the
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
this
question.
justice
potter
stewart
not
identical
to
the
law
in
the
federal
courts
as
construed
in
this
case
by
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
the
general
hawkins
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
bothers
me
about
your
argument
is
that
it
is
almost
precisely
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
hawkins
case,
which
was
argued
in
my
very
first
week
on
this
court.
while,
as
you
know,
i
wrote
separately,
i
didn't
agree
with
the
court
in
the
hawkins
case,
eight
members
of
the
court
applying
their
reason
did
reach
the
result
that
they
reached.
and
all
that
you
have
pointed
out
to
us
that
has
happened
since
in
the
21
years
since
then
is
that
some
eight
more
states
have
amended
their
evidentiary
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
certain
reason,
there
was
reason
of
eight
members
of
the
court
in
1958
that
the
hawkins
rule
was
the
right
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
some
experience,
from
19
to
27.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
has
changed
in
the
way
of
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
you
know,
i
didn't
agree
with
the
court,
but
eight
members
were
of
the
same
view
and
that
was
the
exercise
of
their
reasoning.
what
has
changed
it
since?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
the
court
should
overrule
the
hawkins
rule
to
the
broad
extent
that
you
urge
this
morning,
that
there
might
be
a
claim
in
every
case
and
therefore
the
necessity
of
a
judicial
inquiry
into
just
how
voluntary
the
wife's
testimony
was?
i
remember
the
hawkins
case,
the
wife
had
been
jailed
and
released
on
$3,000
bond,
as
i
remember
it,
conditioned
upon
her
testifying
in
court
against
her
husband,
and
that
didn't
seem
very
voluntary.
in
this
case,
she
was
granted
immunity
and
that
arguably
doesn't
seem
very
voluntary.
don't
you
think
that
this
would
lead
to
an
inquiry,
the
claim
being
made
and
therefore
a
necessary
inquiry
in
every
case
as
to
just
was
it
or
was
it
not
voluntary
testimony?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
you
think
every
convicted
defendant
would
make
that
contention?
justice
potter
stewart
she
would
be
penalized
because
she
could
offer
no
quid
pro
quo
in
the
negotiations?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
a
general
exception
to
the
rule,
isn't
there,
that
a
spouse
may
always
testify
as
to
wrongdoing
by
the
other
spouse
against
him
or
her?
justice
potter
stewart
or
threaten
to
indict
her.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
the
government's
position
to
be
in
either
of
its
alternative
arguments
that
the
spouse
could
be
compelled
to
testify
against
her
will.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
there
is
spousal
privilege.
