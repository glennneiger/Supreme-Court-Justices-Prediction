mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
for
review
of
this
court
as
the
result
of
the
conviction
of
otis
trammel,
jr.,
the
petitioner
herein,
for
aiding
and
abetting
the
importation
of
heroin
from
the
philippines
into
hawaii
and
the
united
states
and
for
conspiring
with
others,
approximately
nine
persons
named
in
the
original
indictment,
for
the
importation
of
heroin
into
the
united
states.
it
resulted
from
the
arrest
of
elizabeth
trammel
on
november
6,
1975
in
hawaii
as
she
entered
the
country
carrying
a
substantial
quantity
of
heroin
on
a
trip
in
from
clark
air
force
base
in
the
philippines.
at
the
time
of
mrs.
trammel's
arrest,
she
was
alone.
she
was
told
that
she
was
charged
with
a
serious
felony
and
she
was
offered
the
voluntary
opportunity
of
cooperating
with
the
government
in
exchange
for
being
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
and
a
recommendation
of
probation
or,
in
the
alternative,
being
jailed
for
the
felony
for
which
she
had
been
arrested.
she
elected
the
latter
alternative
and
indicated
that
she
would
cooperate
with
the
government,
notifying
the
customs
agents
at
that
time
that
she
intended
to
take
the
heroin
to
colorado,
to
deliver
it
to
an
individual
by
the
name
of
roberts
who
was
then
stationed
in
colorado
springs,
colorado.
that
was
done
under
a
controlled
circumstances
and
at
the
first
statement
given
by
mrs.
trammel
to
the
customs
authorities
in
the
drug
enforcement
administration
at
that
time,
she
did
not
in
any
way
implicate
the
petitioner
here,
otis
trammel.
after
the
controlled
delivery
took
place
in
denver,
colorado,
and
mr.
roberts
was
arrested
together
with
a
mr.
richardson,
mrs.
trammel
was
sent
on
at
that
time
and
still
told
that
her
cooperation
would
be
necessary
and
in
exchange
for
her
cooperation
she
was
being
offered
a
misdemeanor
and
a
recommendation
of
probation.
she
was
again
interviewed
at
denver
and
at
that
time
once
again
she
did
not
implicate
her
husband,
the
petitioner
here.
finally,
approximately
a
month
to
six
weeks
after
mrs.
trammel's
arrest,
she
was
interviewed
in
birmingham,
alabama,
which
was
her
family
home,
at
that
time
she
implicated
her
husband
as
the
part
of
an
importation
conspiracy
and
as
an
aider
and
abettor
to
the
initial
importation
for
which
she
had
been
caught
and
she
was
notified
once
again
that
she
would
have
--
that
her
cooperation
with
the
government
would
be
recognized
and
that
she
would
receive
leniency
for
that.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
any
different,
but
i
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
well,
i
think
it
is
involved
with
the
legal
principle
is
the
principle
that
the
government
tries
in
their
brief
and
i
assume
by
argument
here
today
to
convince
this
court
that
there
should
be
an
exception
to
the
husband-wife
privilege,
that
being
the
voluntary
consent
of
the
witness
spouse
or
one
of
the
parties
to
the
marriage.
if
that
were
to
be
an
exception,
it
seems
to
me
that
voluntariness
becomes
a
serious
question
and
her
voluntariness
is
certainly
subject
to
consideration
when
she
is
in
two
prior
interviews
does
not
notify
the
authorities
of
his
participation
and
only
ultimately,
with
all
of
the
offers
on
the
table,
she
finally
agrees
to
or
she
talks
about
him
and
agrees
to
testify
against
him.
it
is
hard
to
call
that
in
my
estimation
voluntary.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
think
she
had
neglected
to
mention
him
in
the
earlier
interviews.
she
mentioned
more
people
as
time
went
by
apparently
to
get
a
better
deal.
the
ultimate
deal
she
got
is
she
was
not
charged
with
any
crime
nor
convicted
of
anything;
in
fact,
she
was
given
witness
immunity
in
exchange
for
her
testimony.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
in
certain
circumstances,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
it
must
be
viewed
as
involuntary
but
whether
it
is
voluntary
or
not
i
think
certainly
representing
a
defendant
charged
as
a
result
of
such
plea
negotiation,
it
would
be
the
right
of
counsel
in
most
circumstances
to
bring
that
out,
bring
out
the
negotiations,
to
point
out
what
that
person
has
traded
for
his
testimony,
and
juries
are
instructed,
it
has
been
my
experience,
to
weigh
that
testimony
very
carefully
where
an
accomplice
is
involved,
because
those
people
have
a
self
interest.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
in
certain
circumstances,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice
where
witness
immunity
is
granted
to
a
granted
to
a
witness
who
does
not
want
it
that
is
involuntary.
certainly
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no.
you
asked
me
for
a
circumstance
where
i
would
find
it
to
be
involuntary.
i
think
she
wanted
it
here.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
certainly
it
would
seem
to
me
in
a
situation
where
a
person
is
offered
to
either
be
charged
with
a
serious
felony
and
serve
time
in
prison
as
a
result
of
that
charge
or
in
the
alternative
to
become
a
witness
and
not
be
charged
with
anything
and
serve
no
time,
i
think
there
is
coercion.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
a
person
can
be
granted
immunity
without
their
permission.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no,
they
can
elect
contempt
of
court
as
opposed
to
the
accepting
of
the
immunity
and
actually
testifying.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
not
entirely,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
seen
people
granted
immunity
who
didn't
want
it
and
would
just
as
soon
have
stood
trial
and
who
opted
for
contempt
as
opposed
to
willingness
to
testify.
that
has
happened
and
that
is
a
circumstance
where
a
person
didn't
want
it
but
nonetheless
the
result
is
the
same.
some
two
months
after
mrs.
trammel
or
three
months
after
mrs.
trammel
was
caught
entering
the
united
states
with
heroin,
the
defendants
were
indicted,
three
defendants
were
indicted
and
six
persons
were
named
as
unindicted
co-conspirators
in
this
case
in
count
two
which
was
conspiracy
to
import
heroin.
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
lawsuit,
the
matter
was
here
before
the
court
and
husband-wife
privilege
was
raised
by
a
motion
to
suppress,
requesting
the
district
court
judge
-
a
motion
to
sever,
excuse
me,
requesting
the
district
court
judge
to
sever
mr.
trammel
from
the
other
two
defendants
who
were
then
charged
so
that
mr.
trammel
could
claim
his
privilege
in
an
independent
trial.
the
whole
point
of
the
hearing,
however,
was
strictly
the
privilege
question
and
at
that
time
the
district
court
judge
refused
to
recognize
that
such
a
privilege
existed
and
the
government
argued
that
no
such
privilege
existed
and
the
district
court
judge
indicated
that
mrs.
trammel
would
in
fact
be
required
to
testify.
subsequently,
within
approximately
three
days,
the
trial
began.
mrs.
trammel
was
called
to
testify,
a
motion
and
order
granting
immunity
were
given
her,
and
again
the
petitioner,
mr.
trammel,
raised
the
question
of
the
husband-wife
privilege
and
once
again
the
court
said
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
would
be
the
same
and
basically
not
recognizing
the
privilege,
only
recognizing
a
communications
privilege
and
noting
that
the
communications
privilege
would
be
fully
enforced
and
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
testify
to
privileged
communications.
in
addition,
at
the
time
that
this
matter
was
argued
before
the
united
sates
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
government
once
again,
according
to
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
took
the
position
that
the
privilege
that
i
am
here
to
argue
today
just
didn't
exist
in
effect.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
privilege
did
in
fact
exist
but
took
the
position
that
because
of
the
fact
that
she
was
a
co-participant
or
a
co-conspirator
in
the
case,
and
also
because
of
the
fact
that
she
was
granted
witness
immunity,
that
she
should
have
been
permitted
to
testify
and
that
it
did
not
violate
the
precedent
set
forth
in
hawkins
v.
united
states,
which
is
the
last
case
in
which
this
court
came
face-to-face
with
the
privilege
that
is
before
the
court
today.
in
the
hawkins
case,
the
court
held,
this
court
has
held
that
the
privilege
was
an
absolute
one,
of
one
spouse
to
keep
the
other
spouse
off
the
witness
stand
and
that
that
privilege
took
precedence
over,
in
the
case
of
hawkins
at
least,
the
conviction
of
mr.
hawkins,
his
wife
was
called
to
testify
against
him
and
who
was,
i
think
it
is
clearly
arguable
from
the
case
and
clearly
notable
within
the
case,
that
his
wife
was
herself
a
co-participant
at
least
to
the
degree
that
she
was
running
the
house
of
prostitution
to
which
the
young
lady
being
transported
across
state
lines
was
to
go
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trip
and
may
well
have
been
an
aider
and
abettor,
may
well
have
been
a
co-conspirator
in
that
case.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
opinion
shows
that
she
was
running
a
house
of
prostitution
in
state
in
which
the
young
lady
was
going,
and
i
think
it
also
shows
that
that
is
where
the
young
lady
ended
up.
whether
or
not
she
was
a
participant
is
subject
to
some
speculation.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
think
the
record
also
indicates
that
--
i
think
the
report
of
the
case
also
indicates
that
she
testified
that
the
young
lady
was
coming
to
her
establishment.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
at
any
rate,
hawkins
made
the
privilege
--
it
is
my
position
an
absolute
privilege,
the
government
argued
at
that
time
the
same
thing
that
the
government
argues
before
this
court
in
its
brief
now,
that
the
privilege
should
reside
in
the
witness
spouse
rather
than
the
defendant
spouse,
and
that
the
witness
should
be
the
one
to
make
a
voluntary
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
or
she
should
testify
when
his
or
her
spouse
is
accused
and
on
trial.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
in
hawkins,
and
i
urge
that
it
be
rejected
again.
i
would
also
note
that
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
rules
of
evidence
that
this
court
took
the
position
in
approximately
1974
when
the
rules
of
evidence
were
being
considered
by
the
congress,
this
court
sent
up
rules
of
evidence
and
the
husband
and
wife
privilege
sent
up
by
the
advisory
committee
was
identical
to
the
privilege
that
is
presently
set
out
in
hawkins.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't,
but
it
does
seem
that
it
would
have
been,
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
change
the
hawkins
situation,
that
the
rules
of
evidence
--
it
would
have
been
an
ideal
time
to
formulate
a
rule
that
was
more
consistent
with
the
court's
thinking.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
what
congress
did
was
it
took
the
13
rules
that
were
sent
up
on
privilege
and
got
rid
of
all
except
one.
congress
rejected
both
the
advisory
committee's
suggestion
of
rules
as
well
as
the
justice
department's
suggestion
of
the
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
they
say
it
should
be
left
to
common
law
as
determined
by
reason
and
experience,
the
same
thing
they
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
would
be
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
not
by
501,
but
i
think
by
title
28,
section
2076,
that
you
are
in
fact
forbidden,
at
least
arguably
so
from
overruling
it,
and
i
have
to
confess
that
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
it
seems
to
me
that
if
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that's
right.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that's
right.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
or
abolished
or
modified
an
old
one.
but
because
privilege
is
set
out
specifically
in
2076
as
having
to
have
the
approval
of
congress,
and
because
the
only
thing
relative
to
privilege
in
the
rules
of
evidence,
rule
501,
the
only
thing
relative
at
all
to
privilege
is
in
that
rule.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
if
you
read
the
two
together,
i
think
you
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
congress
is
encouraging
the
court
to
reconsider
privilege
but
is
holding
the
string
that
they
want
to
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no,
i
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that
is
strongly
arguable,
that
it
should
be
summarily
reversed
for
that
very
reason
and
that
the
advisory
committee
on
the
courts
should
be
the
ones
to
recommend
changes
in
the
rules
or
the
justice
department
to
recommend
changes
in
the
rules
to
congress
and
that
congress
should
act
on
them.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
are
non-justiciable.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
unless
the
last
sentence
in
2076
means
nothing,
it
has
to
be
read
with
501,
and
the
only
way
they
can
be
read
together
is
that
rule
changes
must
go
through
congress.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
all
right.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
think
that
that
is
your
duty.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
think
that
is
part
of
your
duty
to
resolve
it.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
where
privilege
is
concerned,
you
might
be
required
to
reverse
it
were
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
2076
seems
to
indicate
that
is
a
fact,
and
i
don't
pretend
to
know
that
that
is
what
it
means.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
chief
justice,
they
said
they
were
going
to
leave
it
to
the
courts,
at
the
same
time
they
enacted
something
that
said
the
courts
must
come
to
us
for
permission
where
privilege
is
concerned.
i
can
only
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
think
they
are
talking
about
the
rulemaking
process.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
absolutely,
you're
not,
but
we
are
discussing
a
rule
before
this
court
that
was
left
in
a
certain
way
by
congress
as
a
rule
they
didn't
want
changed.
i'm
not
arguing
for
the
fact
that
a
decision
of
this
court
in
any
way
would
have
to
be
sent
to
congress
for
the
congress
to
say
yes
or
no
to
it.
i
am
only
saying
that
that
is
the
only
suggestion
that
can
be
made
from
2076
as
i
read
it.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
unfortunately
i
had
considered
that
seriously
when
i
came
up
here
and
suggesting
that,
because
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
and
no
consistent
way
for
this
court
to
deal
with
it
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
no.
they
are
advocating
how
the
rulemaking
process
should
function.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
agree
with
you
there,
not
how
you
should
decide
cases.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
should
in
my
favor.
but
i
also
think
that
when
they
say
that,
that
it
is
perhaps
somewhat
presumptuous
of
the
circuits
to
then
decide
a
case
contrary
to
hawkins
and
contrary
to
the
prior
law
and
say
on
a
case
by
case
basis
we
have
decided
to
change
it
when
the
congress
wanted
to
retain
the
rulemaking
power
as
a
result
of
that
statute.
and
i
point
that
out
because
it
is
there.
i
am
not
suggesting
in
any
way
that
it
is
necessarily
controlling
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
i
agree
very
strongly
with
the
statement
that
it
was
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
at
that
time
that
it
would
destroy
almost
any
marriage
for
one
of
the
marriage
partners
to
be
called
as
a
witness
against
the
other,
and
i
think
that
is
true
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
if
a
spouse
stands
up
and
testifies
in
open
court
against
his
or
her
mate,
that
the
marriage
is
probably
at
that
point
irretrievably
shattered
and
would
not
return
to
any
semblance
of
trust
between
the
two
as
a
result
of
the
testimony.
so
i
think
that
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
black
suggests
early
on,
i
think
that
is
still
the
same
situation
today.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
it
is
part
of
what
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion.
however,
he
also
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion,
which
i
agree
very
strongly
with,
that
no
one
case
is
the
case
that
should
change
this
if
it
is
a
relic
of
the
past,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not,
but
that
the
advisory
committee
for
the
courts
should
consider
this
matter
seriously
and
if
a
change
should
be
made
it
should
be
an
intelligent
change
on
that
basis.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have.
there
is
certainly
no
question
about
that.
but
this
rule
strikes
at
the
very
heart
of
the
family,
of
marital
harmony
which
is
i
suggest
an
institution
of
authority,
a
non-governmental
institution
of
authority
in
this
country
which
undergoes
a
significant
amount
of
fire
in
today's
times
as
a
result
of
the
way
society
operates,
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
strongly
support
the
institution
of
the
home,
the
institution
of
marriage
against
attacks
in
this
kind
of
situation
against
that
institution
to
testify
and
in
effect
break
the
home.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
the
law
of
colorado
is
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
--
it
would
be
identical
to
the
law
in
the
federal
court
with
respect
to
this
question.
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
accused
to
keep
the
witness
off
the
witness
stand
if
the
accused
chooses
to
use
that,
utilize
the
privilege.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
correct,
not
identical,
but
identical
to
what
the
hawkins
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
the
general
hawkins
approach
to
this
particular
privilege
would
be
identical
in
colorado.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
certainly
think
it
would
and
it
would
be
--
it
is
a
practical
reaction
to
the
fact
that
a
divorce
could
not
otherwise
in
most
situations
be
accomplished
because
you
are
talking
about
a
matter
that
is
solely
within
the
interest
of
the
two
parties
who
are
being
divorced
and
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
if
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
unfamiliar
with
it.
in
colorado,
it
could
not
happen.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
the
general
exception.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
by
the
time
that
she
elected
to
take
the
stand
in
this
case
to
protect
herself,
i
think
it
is
no
less
shattered.
i
think
in
this
case
it
might
easily
be
said
that
the
marriage
were
shattered
by
her
choice.
it
could
have
had
problems
prior
to
that
time,
but
certainly
once
she
took
the
witness
stand,
the
marriage
i
would
think
would
have
been
ruined.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
government
should
have
the
opportunity,
it
seems
to
me,
to
try
to
convince
her
to
destroy
the
marriage
by
taking
the
witness
stand
so
that
merely
for
her
own
protection
the
government
argues
in
their
brief
about
the
fact
that
they
feel
a
defendant
in
almost
every
case
for
his
own
self
interest
would
claim
the
privilege,
and
i
wouldn't
deny
that
argument.
but
by
the
same
token,
mrs.
trammel
in
her
own
self
interest,
to
keep
herself
out
of
jail,
elected
to
speak
about
activities
between
her
husband
and
anyone
else,
including
everyone
involved
in
this.
i
would
point
out
that
the
co-conspirator
exception
that
the
government
argues
for
has
a
glaring
problem
in
this
case
that
can
be
seen
from
the
record,
and
that
is
how
simple
it
is
to
accuse
someone
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
without
actually
them
having
any
great
involvement
in
the
case.
i'm
not
speaking
of
elizabeth
trammel.
i
am
speaking
of
ben
richardson,
jr.
and
josephine
flewellen.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
you
will
find
that
both
of
those
persons
were
named
as
unindicted
co-conspirators.
ben
richardson,
jr.
did
no
more
than
drive
mr.
roberts
to
the
airport,
not
knowing
his
reason
for
going
and
not
knowing
what
was
going
to
happen
when
he
arrived.
josephine
flewellen
did
no
more
than
ride
in
an
automobile
from
the
airport
at
clark
air
force
base
in
the
philippines
to
the
airport
so
that
mrs.
trammel
could
get
on
an
airplane
to
come
to
the
united
states,
and
yet
both
of
those
people
were
named
as
unindicted
co-conspirators
simply
to
get
in
testimony
that
may
have
been
available
and
otherwise
would
have
been
unavailable
perhaps
because
of
the
rules
of
hearsay.
mr.
richardson
testified
at
trial,
didn't
ask
for
immunity,
denied
all
personal
culpability
in
the
case,
but
he
was
named
as
an
indicted
co-conspirator.
if
the
same
circumstance
had
taken
place
where
mrs.
trammel
was
concerned
and
she
had
been
permitted
to
go
on
and
testify
simply
because
the
government
chose
to
indict
her
or
name
her
in
the
indictment,
then
the
marriage
would
equally
have
been
destroyed
but
to
no
gain
for
anyone
because
it
would
have
been
clear
that
she
was
not
a
part
of
the
conspiracy.
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
was
not
a
conspiracy
in
this
case,
there
certainly
was.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
if
the
circumstance
of
getting
a
conviction,
yes,
the
government
has
to
prove
that
the
person
is
a
co-conspirator,
but
i
think
before
a
grand
jury
by
placing
the
name
of
a
person
in
an
indictment
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
is
a
very
simple
matter
and
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
where
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
could
not
draft
an
indictment
in
such
a
way
if
he
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
or
threaten
to
indict
her
or
call
her
an
aider
or
abettor.
in
the
lilley
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
husband
and
wife
were
called
aiders
and
abettors,
under
title
18,
section
2.
in
that
case,
both
denied
and
laid
it
off
on
the
other,
but
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
rule
prevented
the
testimony
of
one
against
the
other.
the
cameron
case,
that
the
government
relies
on
strongly,
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
1977
case,
would
if
this
court
adopts
what
the
government
argues
for,
of
necessity
should
have
been
overruled
because
mrs.
cameron
said
"i
don't
want
to
testify
against
my
husband,
i'm
not
involved,
i
have
no
desire
to
testify,"
and
the
judge
said,
"i
don't
think
you
have
much
of
a
marriage
anyway,
therefore
you
will
testify."
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that
is
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
in
the
cameron
case
there
could
have
been
no
testimony,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that
is
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
in
their
second
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
that
is
what
i
understand
their
position
to
be,
mr.
justice
white.
i
understand
them
to
talk
about
the
implementation
of
that
rule
in
terms
of
the
prosecutor
making
an
offer
of
proof
to
the
court,
saying,
okay,
she
will
testify
to
the
following
things.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
absolutely
correct,
and
once
the
offer
of
proof
is
made
then
the
judge
decides
whether
or
not
the
judges
believes
she
is
a
co-conspirator.
if
he
does,
then
her
permits
her
to
testify.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
my
understanding
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
as
i
read
their
brief,
the
witness
spouse
would
still
have
some
choice
and,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated
in
his
argument
in
terms
of
the
grant
of
witness
immunity,
the
privilege
could
still
be
claimed
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes
--
then
that
would
imply
a
choice,
but
on
page
28
of
the
government's
brief
they
do
indicate
that
what
they
are
suggesting
is
that
if
the
parties
are
co-conspirators
then
the
government
would
make
an
offer
of
proof
to
the
court
and
when
it
does
that,
make
the
offer
of
proof,
if
the
judge
decides
that
he
believes
they
are
co-conspirators,
then
he
would
permit
the
wife
to
testify.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far,
but
it
is
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
--
it
is
argued,
yes,
that
that
is
true.
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
terry
wiggins
yes,
that
is
one
of
my
problems.
but
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
granting
of
witness
immunity
--
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
confused
the
rights
of
witness
immunity
and
the
privilege
considerably
because
witness
immunity
i
had
understood
after
the
kastigar
case
was
a
fairly
settled
matter.
and
now
to
take
witness
immunity
and
try
to
superimpose
a
husband-wife
privilege
where
the
privilege
has
always
been
held
not
in
the
immunized
party
but
in
the
other
person,
both
not
only
confuses
the
privilege,
the
husband-wife
privilege,
but
i
think
confuses
immunity,
because
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
there
are
circumstances
where
a
person
could
be
granted
witness
immunity
and
still
claim
the
marital
privilege,
at
least
the
way
the
law
has
been
to
date.
thank
you.
