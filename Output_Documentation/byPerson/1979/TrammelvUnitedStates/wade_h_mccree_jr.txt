mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
in
this
case
and
we
concede
essentially
that
if
this
court
adheres
to
its
ruling
in
hawkins,
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed
because
without
the
spouse's
testimony
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
link
the
petitioner
to
the
conspiracy
charge.
i
qualified
my
concession
with
the
word
"essentially"
because
the
court
could
decline
to
hold
that
the
privilege
against
adverse
spouse
testimony
does
not
apply
where
the
witness
spouse
is
willing
to
testify
and
it
could
still
admit
her
testimony
here
for
the
reasons
that
she
and
the
petitioner
were
joint
participants
in
the
conspiracy
to
import
heroin
as
charged
in
the
indictment.
this
argument
about
their
being
joint
conspirators
was
not
presented
to
the
court
in
hawkins,
nor
was
it
considered
by
the
court
in
its
opinion.
we
also
observe
at
the
outset
that
the
opinion
in
hawkins
does
not
foreclose
our
request
that
the
court
reconsider
it,
because
although
the
court
said
"under
these
circumstances
we
are
unable
to
subscribe
to
the
idea
that
an
exclusionary
rule
based
on
the
persistent
instincts
of
several
centuries
should
now
be
abandoned,
nevertheless,"
it
stated,
"as
we
have
already
indicated,
however,
this
decision
does
not
foreclose
whatever
changes
in
the
rule
may
eventually
be
dictated
by
reason
and
experience."
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
that
is
our
principal
argument
and
i
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
no
one's
choice
is
ever
absolutely
voluntary.
everyone
makes
a
choice,
whenever
he
does,
within
the
context
of
a
series
of
circumstances
and
we
have
to
begin
with
the
premise
that
she
was
already
involved
in
the
offense
and
therefore
her
selection
of
choices
was
necessarily
limited.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
she
indeed
could
assert
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
she
could
still
as
we
suggest
claim
the
privilege
as
the
witness
spouse
not
to
testify.
she
could
claim
it
on
the
basis
of
preserving
marital
harmony.
and
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
overturn
that,
we
just
say
that
the
privilege
should
continue
but
the
privilege
should
be
exercised
by
the
witness
spouse
instead
of
the
defendant
spouse,
because
she
is
the
one
more
likely
by
her
decision
to
indicate
whether
there
is
anything
worth
saving.
we
suggest
that
by
placing
the
privilege
in
the
defendant
spouse,
he
will
invariably
prevent
the
witness
spouse
from
testifying,
not
because
of
a
desire
to
save
the
marital
harmony
but
to
save
his
own
hide
in
the
prosecution.
so
we
are
suggesting
that
her
decision
is
a
reliable
indicator
of
the
existence
of
a
marriage
whose
harmony
and
felicity
should
be
protected,
but
to
place
it
with
him
doesn't
serve
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
privilege.
that
essentially
is
our
argument
about
the
rule
enunciated
in
hawkins.
we
say
don't
destroy
the
privilege
but
give
it
to
the
witness
spouse
instead
of
the
defendant
spouse.
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
--
and
i
won't
dwell
on
this
at
any
great
length
--
actually
there
are
two
related
rules
and
we
are
only
talking
about
one
of
them,
and
i
would
like
to
make
that
clear.
as
the
concurring
opinion
in
hawkins
states,
there
was
originally
only
one
rule
and
it
stemmed
from
two
concepts
both
long
since
rejected.
one
was
the
rule
that
a
party,
an
interested
party
could
not
testify
in
a
lawsuit,
and
the
other
was
the
fiction
that
at
law
husband
and
wife
were
one
and,
as
some
persons
have
said,
he
was
it.
and
since
he
could
not
testify
in
his
own
behalf,
he
could
prevent
his
subordinate
alter-ego
or
his
subordinate
alter-ego
also
was
incompetent
to
testify
in
his
behalf.
but
after
the
law
evolved
to
permit
interested
parties
to
testify,
two
rules
evolved
from
this
earlier
one.
one
is
the
rule
that
prevents
either
spouse
from
testifying
against
the
other,
and
that
is
the
rule
that
hawkins
--
with
which
hawkins
was
concerned,
and
the
other
rule,
of
course,
is
a
rule
relating
to
confidential
communications,
and
neither
spouse
can
be
required
to
reveal
a
confidential
communication
and
each
spouse
has
a
right
to
prevent
the
other
from
doing
it,
and
that
rule
even
survives
the
demise
of
a
marriage,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
that
at
all
here.
we
are
talking
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
are
not
challenging
that
at
all.
and
we
point
out,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
in
trammel,
in
the
court
below,
the
court
very
carefully
made
this
distinction
between
these
two
rules,
and
we
are
talking
about
what
is
sometimes
called
the
anti-marital
rule,
although
the
reason
for
that
nomenclature
rather
escapes
me,
it
is
the
rule
that
permits
either
or
both
spouses
from
preventing
the
other
from
testifying
against
him
as
to
matters
not
confidential
communications.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
this
rule
should
not
permit
the
defendant
spouse
to
exercise
it
but
should
permit
the
witness
spouse
to
exercise
it.
we
begin
in
our
argument
by
pointing
out
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
every
person's
evidence.
this
court
has
frequently
enunciated
that
rule
and,
as
has
been
observed,
whenever
the
public
will
be
deprived
of
relevant
evidence,
there
should
be
an
overriding
consideration
to
compel
such
an
exception
to
this
general
rule.
and
we
suggest
that
there
may
be,
with
reference
to
confidential
communications
between
spouses,
we
don't
touch
that
at
all.
but
we
suggest
that
if
the
price
would
be
that
an
offense
would
not
be
proved
without
violating
any
effort
to
be
confidential
between
the
spouses,
that
that
is
too
great
a
price
to
pay.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mwell,
i
think
i
would
and
many
states
have.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mandate
of
rule
501
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
is
that
the
privileges
should
be
based
upon
principles
of
the
common
law
as
interpreted
by
the
united
states
courts
in
the
light
of
experience
and
reason.
i
would
address
first
the
question
of
experience.
the
experience
of
this
country
indicates
the
following.
in
1958,
when
hawkins
was
decided,
as
the
concurring
opinion
states,
there
were
19
states
that
permitted
inter-spousal
testimony.
now
that
number
has
increased
to
27
states,
including
the
district
of
columbia,
which
incidentally
did
not
change
but
had
the
rule
then.
now,
a
clear
majority
of
the
states
have
no
rule
that
would
prevent
the
hawkins
result,
and
we
think
that
this
tells
us
something
about
the
experience
of
the
country
because
these
27
states
and
the
district
include
some
very
populous
states
like
new
york,
illinois,
california,
ohio,
and
in
their
totality
they
include
60
percent
of
all
the
population.
and
if
this
is
their
experience,
we
think
this
court
could
consider
it,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
regarded
matters
pertaining
to
the
family
and
to
domestic
matters
as
peculiarly
within
the
concern
of
the
states
under
an
appropriate
approach
to
federalism.
so
we
think
on
experience
there
is
a
reason
to
reexamine
hawkins,
and
we
think
on
the
basis
of
reason
there
is,
as
i
have
suggested,
if
we
want
to
see
whether
there
is
a
marriage
worth
saving,
find
out
whether
the
witness
spouse
is
willing
to
testify.
if
it
is
a
good
marriage,
she
is
not
going
to
want
to
testify.
if
it
is
just
a
sham,
if
it
is
a
shell,
if
it
is
just
a
nominal
marriage,
she
is
likely
to
do
it.
but
the
defendant
spouse
always
will.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
have
not
examined
all
of
them
that
carefully
and
i
can't
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
we
set
them
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
some
of
them
relate
to
civil
and
others
to
criminal,
but
almost
invariably
they
relate
to
criminal
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
hawkins
and
for
that
reason
i
did
not
pursue
it
to
determine
it
to
that
extent.
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
district
of
columbia
has
had
a
rule
that
allowed
a
witness
spouse
to
testify
against
a
defendant
spouse
in
a
criminal
case
for
more
than
half
a
century,
and
i
think
that
is
significant
because
the
congress
has
approved
the
district
of
columbia
rule.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
justice
rehqnsuit,
and
there
are
exceptions
to
the
inter-spousal
rule
that
have
developed
out
of
common
sense
reasons,
just
like
the
divorce
one.
others
are
if
the
defendant
spouse
is
accused
of
an
offense,
a
criminal
offense
against
the
witness
spouse
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
obviously
the
witness
spouse
can
testify
there
or
else
the
defendant
spouse
could
inflict
criminal
injury
on
her
in
private
and
enjoy
complete
immunity.
it
has
been
extended
to
allow
the
witness
spouse
to
testify
when
the
defendant
spouse
is
charged
with
an
offense
against
children
of
the
marriage.
in
fact,
some
rules
go
as
far
as
children
of
the
other
spouse
even
if
they
are
not
children
of
the
marriage.
other
exceptions
extend
to
offenses
by
the
defendant
spouse
against
property
of
--
separate
property
of
the
witness
spouse,
and
we
suggest
that
if
these
exceptions
are
valid,
and
we
think
they
are
--
we
think
they
serve
a
societal
purpose
--
it
also
serves
a
societal
purpose
to
permit
the
witness
spouse
to
decide
whether
she
will
testify
against
the
defendant
spouse
when
the
public
is
in
dire
need
of
her
testimony.
because
here
a
major
drug
trafficker
is
going
to
go
free
if
we
adhere
to
the
rule
of
hawkins,
without
it
serving
any
purpose
of
promoting
marital
harmony
here.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
is
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
is
significant
because
--
and
as
rule
501
mandates
and
as
the
court
observed
in
hawkins
before
rule
501,
that
these
privileges
evolved
in
the
light
of
experience
and
reason,
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
eight
more
states
have
moved
is
significant
experience.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
think
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
this
case
is
different
in
another
respect,
too,
and
maybe
we
don't
have
to
overrule
hawkins
if
this
court
would
decide
that
where
both
spouses
were
engaged
in
a
joint
criminal
activity
that
the
interest
of
society
in
having
the
testimony
of
the
witness
spouse
should
override
any
consideration
of
marital
harmony.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is,
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
we
don't
even
ask
the
court
to
go
that
far.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
welcome
the
court,
if
it
wished
to
take
that
step,
but
we
say
the
court
doesn't
have
to
take
that
much
of
a
step.
if
it
leaves
the
privilege
in
the
witness
spouse,
that
is
sufficient
to
uphold
this
and
it
is
still
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
what
the
public
would
gain
would
be
the
preservation
of
marital
harmony
if
she
believed
that
it
would
be
jeopardized
by
her
testimony.
we
suggest
that
her
willingness
or
not
to
testify
would
be
an
indicator
of
whether
there
was
anything
there
worth
saving.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
see
no
limitation
on
your
changing
it.
my
brother
yesterday
was
addressing
title
28,
section
--
well,
we
refer
to
it
in
a
footnote
on
page
10
of
our
brief.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
2077.
but
that
relates
only
to
this
court
and
specifically
relates
to
this
court
in
its
rulemaking
function
and
not
its
adjudicatory
function,
and
we
are
here
in
the
latter
capacity
and
not
the
former.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
my
understanding,
and
it
doesn't
inhibit,
it
doesn't
prevent
the
court
at
this
time
from
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
unless
the
court
presumed
to
do
it
in
its
rulemaking
capacity.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
i
find
that
in
the
language
that
speaks
of
the
court
in
its
rulemaking
power.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
have
a
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
that
would
be
in
the
exercise
of
its
rulemaking
power.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
are
saying
that
when
--
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
no
privilege.
we
are
saying
that
the
court
can
allow
the
privilege
to
remain
but
just
permit
her
to
exercise
the
privilege.
that
is
one
thing
we
are
saying.
the
other
is
we
are
saying
you
can
abolish
the
privilege
when
she
is
jointly
charged
with
the
offense.
and
under
either
formulation,
the
conviction
of
trammel
below
would
stand.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
she
was
charged
or
she
was
named
in
the
indictment
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
logically
to
do
otherwise
would
permit
a
person
send
on
a
criminal
enterprise
to
enlist
the
services
of
his
wife
in
that
enterprise
with
the
full
knowledge
that
she
could
never
be
used
as
a
witness
against
him,
and
we
are
suggesting
that
that
is
not
socially
desirable
and
that
certainly
if
that
is
a
consequence,
it
isn't
a
reason
for
overruling
the
general
principle
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
every
person's
testimony
or
evidence.
but
that
could
indeed
be
the
consequence
of
overturning
this
conviction
of
trammel.
he
could
enlist
her
as
indeed
he
did
and
she
did
all
of
the
actual
obtaining
of
the
heroin
in
the
southeast
pacific,
bringing
it
into
the
country,
while
he
would
remain
immune
just
because
this
rule
in
hawkins
would
prevent
it
if
we
listen
to
petitioner's
contention,
and
we
submit
that
we
should
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
contention
were
made,
it
would,
i
must
concede,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
would.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
he
probably
would,
but
similar
contentions
are
made
in
similar
instances.
for
example,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
the
testimony
of
a
co-conspirator
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
in
furtherance
of
its
objects
may
be
used
against
any
other
conspirator,
but
this
requires
the
preliminary
showing
of
some
quantum
of
proof
before
that
comes
in.
in
the
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege,
one
of
the
exceptions
is
if
the
person
consults
an
attorney
and
enlists
him
in
the
commission
of
an
offense,
no
privilege
exists
there
and
there,
too,
some
quantum
of
showing
that
they
were
both
involved
in
the
criminal
activity
would
be
necessary
before
you
could
penetrate
the
attorney-client
privilege.
so
it
isn't
anything
new
to
the
law,
but
it
is
something
that
courts
can
handle
and
do
handle
competently.
there
was
a
so-called
in
limine
act
hearing
here
to
determine
voluntariness
and
this
happens
in
a
number
of
instances,
and
if
it
happened
here
it
wouldn't
differentiate
this
at
all.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
second
branch
of
my
exception
would
not,
and
that
is
why
we
urge
the
first,
that
she
should
be
the
holder
of
the
privilege,
and
if
she
felt
that
there
wasn't
anything
worth
saving
we
could
expect
her
to
be
willing
to
testify.
if
she
felt
there
was
something
worth
saving,
she
wouldn't,
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
would,
and
that
is
why
we
suggest
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
the
broader
one,
and
we
think
society
doesn't
benefit
by
preserving
a
marriage
at
this
extreme
cost.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
concede
it
but
the
courts
are
in
these
collateral
inquiries
all
the
time
where
predicates
for
the
operation
of
a
rule
have
to
be
shown
and
different
quant
of
evidence
are
required
frequently
to
trigger
it.
i
would
also
like
to
observe
that
the
rule
in
hawkins
would
penalize
mrs.
trammel
because
she
is
married
and
that
is
an
unfortunate
result.
there
is
another
woman
involved
in
this
case
who
was
the
girlfriend
--
in
fact,
at
one
point
she
was
referred
to
as
the
roommate
of
another
defendant,
and
she
was
able
to
bargain
for
her
liberty
with
the
prosecution
and
she
was
not
--
she
was
named
as
unindicted
co-sponsorator
and
she
was
not
prosecuted
at
all.
mrs.
trammel
would
be
penalized
because
she
had
gone
through
the
bonds
of
matrimony
with
trammel
and
this
other
woman
who
was
just
living
with
the
other
fellow
would
not
be.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
to
the
prosecutor.
she
couldn't
bargain
for
her
personal
freedom.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
so
for
these
several
reasons,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
court
reconsider
hawkins
and
hold
that
the
admission
of
mrs.
trammel's
testimony
was
not
erroneous
and
affirm
the
conviction.
thank
you.
