chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-5705,
trammel
v.
united
states.
mr.
wiggins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
ordinary
plea
negotiation
situation,
mr.
wiggins,
where
there
is
no
husband
and
wife
problem
or
the
testimonial
aspect
you
have
here,
do
you
regard
the
testimony
of
the
witness
who
cooperates
with
the
government
as
involuntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
come
back
to
my
question,
do
you
regard
that
as
involuntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
circumstances
would
you
characterize
it
as
involuntary
and
in
what
would
you
characterize
it
as
voluntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
she
not
want
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
suggest
any
situation
in
which
the
defendant,
the
possible
defendant
so
testifying
is
coerced
into
accepting
immunity?
can
anyone
be
forced
to
accept
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
be
forced
to
accept
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
don't
want
to
accept
it,
they
simply
take
their
chances
as
a
defendant
and
stand
trial,
isn't
that
the
usual
pattern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
regard
that
kind
of
a
decision
as
equivalent
to
a
holding
of
the
court,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
congress
said
they
were
going
to
leave
it
to
the
courts,
then
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
do
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
courts
or
the
rulemaking
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
aren't
sitting
in
a
rulemaking
process
now,
are
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
they
were
advocating
anything
other
than
how
the
rulemaking
process
would
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
how
we
were
to
decide
a
future
case,
as
justice
white
suggested,
resolving
a
conflict
in
the
circuits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
should
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
weight
do
you
put
on
the
suggestion
that
appears
in
the
hawkins
case
and
elsewhere
that
this
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
marriage
relationship
when
the
husband
or
wife
goes
into
court
and
testifies
against
the
other
and
perhaps
sends
the
other
spouse
to
prison?
you
recall,
justice
black
seemed
to
rest
to
a
significant
extent
on
that
aspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
concurring
opinion
suggested
that
this
whole
concept
was
a
relic
of
the
past
and
has
no
place
in
the
modern
world
of
women's
lib
--
not
quite
in
those
terms.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
changed
some
other
doctrines
and
rules
of
ancient
lineage,
haven't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
this
point
at
10:00
o'clock
in
the
morning,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
trammel
v.
united
states.
at
this
stage,
mr.
wiggins,
are
you
reserving
the
rest
of
your
time
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
does
the
voluntariness
aspect
figure
in
your
exception
to
the
hawkins
rule
that
just
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
voluntary
is
it
when
once
she
is
offered
or
tendered
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
it
just
step
by
step.
suppose
they
had
not
consulted
her
in
advance.
she
had
refused
to
talk
with
the
prosecution
or
investigators,
she
is
called
to
the
stand
when
the
case
is
in
trial,
she
could
assert
the
fifth
amendment,
could
she
not
at
that
stage
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
qand
then
if
that
were
countered
at
that
stage,
rather
than
in
advance
as
it
was
here,
with
a
tender
of
complete
immunity,
then
what
would
be
her
posture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
these
27
states,
mr.
solicitor
general,
has
the
rule
been
altered
with
respect
to
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
or
are
they
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
are
saying
that
conferred
no
new
power
or
jurisdiction
on
us
that
we
didn't
have
before.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
case
require
us
to
decide
any
more
than
that
there
is
no
privilege
when
the
wife
admittedly
is
engaged
in
the
same
criminal
enterprise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
case
she
i
take
it
admitted
her
participation
but
was
protected
by
the
immunity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
exception,
your
narrow
exception
would
not
cover
a
case
where
the
wife
--
if
this
wife
had
been
aware
of
the
criminal
conduct
of
the
husband
and
had
constantly
protested
against
his
activity
and
had
not
participated
in
it,
then
your
exception
would
not
permit
her
to
testify,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
second
one
would
also
prohibit
her
testimony
if
she
saw
her
husband
murder
another
person,
if
there
were
only
the
three
of
them
including
the
victim
present.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
broader
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
voluntariness
factor
element
does,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
put
the
court
into
a
subsidiary
or
a
collateral
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wiggins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
--
i
suppose
there
are
several
ways,
but
how
would
you
characterize
the
reason
basis
for
the
exception
of
permitting
a
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
in
a
divorce
action,
whether
she
is
the
plaintiff
or
whether
he
is
the
plaintiff
and
she
is
resisting
the
divorce?
would
that
be
on
the
theory
that
at
that
stage
in
the
court
room
the
marriage
is
shattered
already?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
divorces
are
granted,
and
a
many
of
them
are
granted
without
the
testimony
of
the
spouse,
if
there
is
objective
evidence
from
other
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
put
that
on
the
basis
and
the
rule
rests
on
the
basis
that
that
kind
of
a
marriage
is
pretty
well
shattered.
when
this
wife
took
the
stand
in
the
criminal
case
to
testify
against
her
husband,
is
that
marriage
any
less
shattered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
immunity
were
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
immunity
were
granted,
he
could
require
under
those
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
starting
with
the
proposition
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
you,
that
she
has
the
option.
now,
she
exercises
that
option
ordinarily
at
the
risk
that
she
might
later
be
indicted
if
she
doesn't
cooperate
with
the
government.
isn't
that
one
of
your
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
trammel
against
the
united
states.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
by
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stewart
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
