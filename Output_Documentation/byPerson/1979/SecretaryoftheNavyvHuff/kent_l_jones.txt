mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
being
argued
in
tandem
with
brown
v.
glines,
in
which
the
court
just
heard
argument.
the
respondents
brought
this
case
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
marine
corps
personnel
stationed
at
the
combat-ready
marine
corps
air
station
at
iwakuni,
japan.
here
as
in
brown
v.
glines,
respondents
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
military
regulations
that
require
the
prior
approval
of
the
base
commander
before
petitions
may
be
distributed
on
base,
and
here
as
in
brown
v.
glines,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
under
10usc
1034,
as
applied
to
the
on-base
distribution
of
petitions
to
members
of
congress.
the
court
of
appeals
limited
its
holding
both
to
the
statutory
issue
and
to
the
iwakuni
base
itself.
it
did
not
reach
any
constitutional
issue.
i
have
already
made
two
points
about
the
statute.
first,
that
it
was
designed
to
protect
private
individual
communications
rather
than
group
petitioning.
we
think
the
legislative
history
on
that
is
clear.
second,
even
if
group
petitioning
were
communication
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
navy
and
air
force
regulations
do
not
restrict
the
communication
of
such
petitions
to
congress.
the
military's
unwillingness
to
open
military
facilities
to
public
activities
traditionally
prohibited
is
not
a
restriction
on
the
communication
of
the
petition
itself.
if
the
court
agrees
with
either
of
those
submissions,
it
need
not
reach
the
third
issue
under
the
statute
which
i
will
discuss
at
this
time.
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
discussion
that
the
regulations
in
some
sense
restrict
the
communication
of
petitions
to
congress,
the
statute
allows
restrictions
imposed
under
regulations
that
are
necessary
to
the
national
security.
the
only
legislative
history
concerning
this
particular
language
in
the
statutes
refers,
of
course,
to
individual
communications.
congressman
vinson
stated
that
the
statute
lets
any
serviceman
"write
his
congressman
on
any
subject
if
it
does
not
violate
the
law
or
if
it
does
not
deal
with
some
secret
matter."
well,
we
concede
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
restrictions
congress
thought
the
words
in
the
statute
might
permit
for
group
petitioning,
and
that
is
because
congress
didn't
think
the
statute
applied
to
this
group
petitioning
activity.
but
the
court
of
appeals
both
here
and
in
the
glines
case
recognized
that
the
regulatory
objective
of
insuring
a
discipline
prepared
military
force
is
essential
to
national
security.
the
courts
held,
however,
that
the
prior
approval
requirement
is
necessary
to
achieve
this
objective
only
in
a
combat
zone,
and
that
outside
a
combat
zone
post-distribution
punishment
is
sufficient.
the
implication
of
the
court's
reasoning
as
we
see
it
is
that
the
need
for
troops
to
be
fully
prepared
for
immediate
action
is
materially
less
outside
a
combat
zone
than
within
one.
but
the
problem
with
that
reasoning
is
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
unrealistic.
the
military
cannot
know
today
and
doesn't
know
today
where
troops
stationed
at
the
strategic
air
base
in
guam
involved
in
the
glines
case
or
at
the
combat
ready
marine
station
in
japan
involved
in
this
case,
where
those
troops
may
be
called
upon
to
serve
tomorrow.
it
is
simply
admonistic
to
suggest
in
an
age
of
jets
and
missiles
that
only
troops
in
a
combat
zone
must
be
fully
prepared
for
immediate
action.
certainly
the
court's
reasoning
is
incorrect
as
applied
to
the
advanced
defense
bases
involved
in
these
two
cases.
general
brown
said
in
his
affidavit
that
was
filed
in
the
huff
case
that
an
effective
military
force
cannot
be
prepared
only
on
the
eve
of
battle
or
during
combat.
he
testified
that
the
highest
standards
of
discipline
and
morale
are
essential
for
readiness
as
well
as
for
combat
itself.
well,
there
wasn't
any
contrary
evidence,
expert
or
otherwise,
in
the
record.
but
the
court
of
appeals
simply
disagreed
with
the
military
assessment.
it's
difficult,
we
concede
that
it's
difficult
to
know
with
certainty
what
is
necessary
in
any
particular
situation
to
insure
military
preparedness.
as
judge
leventhal
said
in
an
analogous
context,
in
culver
v.
secretary
of
air
force,
however,
"whereas
in
this
case
the
military
determination
is
based
on
reasoned
policy
rather
than
on
capriciousness,
it
should
be
sustained."
and
we
think
that's
especially
so
under
a
statute
in
which
congress
never
thought
would
apply
to
group
petitioning
activity.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
under
our
submissions
we
would?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
if
the
statute
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
must
decide
it
in
the
glines
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
the
huff
case,
you
could
decide
it
if
it
wasn't
decided
below.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
our
petition
in
the
huff
case
only
brought
up
the
statutory
issue
because
that's
all
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
was
no
cross
petition.
certainly
it's
within
the
court's
discretion
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
we
briefed
it
fully.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
respondent
in
huff
only
briefed
the
statutory
issue.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right,
final
judgment
couldn't
be
rendered.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
that
regulations
should
be
upheld
under
the
statute
and
under
the
constitution.
i'm
not
saying
the
court
lacks
power
to
render
final
judgment.
i'm
just
saying
it's
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
court
could
send
that
back
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
don't
have
to
decide
it
at
this
time
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
raised
in
our
petition,
it
wasn't
raised
in
a
cross
petition,
it
hasn't
been
aired
below.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
it
perhaps
should
be.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
they
have
that
right,
and
i
don't
think
they
raised
that
claim,
though,
in
their
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
eventual
constitutional
issue
is
different
at
all.
i
think
the
same
principles
apply.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it
were
decided
in
glines
in
our
favor,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
addressed
here
as
well.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
vice
versa.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
all
of
the
underlying
facts
in
the
case
are
not
relevant
to
the
judgment.
the
judgment
was
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunctive
relief,
so
the
facts
that
underlie
the
case
are
not
important.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
regulations
were
held
to
be
facially
invalid,
that
is
to
say
no
application
can
be
given
to
them
at
all.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
have
obtained
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
record
is
mixed
on
that.
we
conceded
that
some
of
the
petitions
should
not
have
been
prohibited
from
distribution
under
the
regulation.
we
didn't
concede
anything
about
the
constitution.
the
concessions
weren't
relevant.
what
the
facts
in
this
case
are
designed
to
do
are
to
show
how
the
regulations
in
some
situations
apply.
but
what
--
the
judgment
they
sought
was
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
the
regulations
cannot
be
applied
in
any
situation
at
the
iwakuni
station,
and
that's
the
judgment
that
the
court
of
appeals
entered.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there
were
several
distributions.
there
was
a
court
martial
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
and
he
sought
review,
in
addition
to
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
they
sought,
this
one
individual
also
sought
to
have
his
court
martial
expunged.
but
he
lost
that
case
because
the
distribution
that
was
the
basis
for
his
court
martial
was
a
distribution
off-base,
which
was
in
violation,
as
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
agreed,
it
was
in
violation
of
the
status
of
forces
agreement
with
japan.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
so
that
individual
aspect
of
the
case
is
definitely
out.
he
lost
that
in
the
district
court.
he
didn't
even
appeal
on
that,
and
he
certainly
didn't
cross
petition
on
it.
so
the
only
issues
left
in
the
case
are
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
on
their
face,
can't
be
applied
at
all.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
a
class
action.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
regulation
doesn't
apply
to
letters.
there
has
been
no
finding
on
that,
no
suggestion
that
it
might.
it
has
never
been
applied
that
way.
there
is
no
ruling
to
that
effect
in
any
court,
and
it
simply
doesn't
have
any
application
of
the
kind
that
respondent
suggested.
the
regulation
does
refer
to
origination
and
signing
of
petitions
and
other
documents
as
well
as
to
the
distribution.
that
language
has
been
construed
consistently
also
to
mean
the
public
solicitation
and
distribution
of
petitions.
the
court
of
appeals
centered
its
holding
on
the
question
of
whether
distribution
of
petitions
can
be
subjected
to
the
regulation
if
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
one
in
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i'm
not.
i
am
referring
to
the
fleet
marine
corps
pacific
order
which
is
set
out
on
pages
4,
5,
and
6.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
if
those
words
"originate
and
sign"
have
any
meaning
independent
of
the
word
"distribution,"
the
issue
as
presented
here,
the
only
holding
in
the
case
is
the
distribution
of
petitions
is
not
properly
subject
to
the
regulations
because
of
the
statute.
in
any
event,
the
regulation
as
it
has
been
construed
by
the
military
simply
applies
to
distribution
and
solicitation.
the
respondents
suggested
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
in
light
of
the
right
of
petitioner.
well,
we
think
it
should
be
construed
in
light
of
its
legislative
history,
and
the
legislative
history,
as
i
have
gone
through
and
i
have
heard
no
rebuttal,
focuses
completely
on
the
individual
communications
to
members
of
congress.
and
there
was,
as
i
have
also
mentioned
before,
another
statute
that
congress
could
have
used
as
a
model
if
it
had
intended
to
apply
the
statute
to
petitioning
activities.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
is
our
position
that
it
wasn't
intended
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
the
regulation
wouldn't
apply
to
them.
whether
the
statute
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
would
be
applicable
there
is
a
question
that
we
haven't
addressed
and
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
would
be.
the
legislative
history
definitely
focuses
on
the
individual,
the
communication
of
an
individual
serviceman.
but
i
think
the
more
important
point,
in
response
to
your
question,
is
that
the
regulation
doesn't
restrict
the
communication
or
that
kind
of
a
letter.
so
even
if
the
statute
were
applied
there,
it
wouldn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
disposition
of
this
case.
the
respondents
also
mentioned
that
the
regulation
has
been
misapplied
on
some
occasions
and
we
conceded
that,
but
the
misapplication
of
the
regulation
doesn't
make
it
patently
invalid.
and
we
don't
know
how
many
rightful
denials
they
were.
those
haven't
been
litigated
and
they
aren't
here.
i
think,
as
in
parker
v.
levy,
the
regulation,
like
the
statute
in
parker
v.
levy,
the
regulation
has
a
substantial
core
context
in
which
it
clearly
applies
and
should
not
be
held
patently
invalid.
thank
you.
