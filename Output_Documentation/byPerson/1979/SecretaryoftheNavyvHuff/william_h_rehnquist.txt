respondents
do
have
a
right
to
support
the
judgment
below
on
an
alternate
ground,
it
was
argued
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
foreign
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
just
meant
that,
when
you
were
just
summarizing
now
as
to
the
prohibition,
one
qualification
to
the
prohibition
is
that
it
applies
only
in
a
foreign
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
involved
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
lower
court
pass
on
that
and
did
you
challenge
that,
the
part
you
just
read?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
really
is
what's
before
us,
is
something
in
a
foreign
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
commanding
officer
on
a
base
in
a
foreign
country
is
constitutionally
permitted
to
prohibit
or
require
advance
submission,
and
like
this
requiring
blanket
advance
submission?
if
the
regulation
is
valid
on
its
face,
do
we
need
go
any
further
and
get
into
the
facts
of
your
case
where
perhaps
the
commanding
officer
exercised
his
discretion
on
an
improper
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
foreign
countries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
your
case
involves
is
foreign
countries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
complain
about
the
refusal
in
the
first
case,
you
simply
claim
about
the
--
your
claim
is
based
on
the
disparate
treatment
between
huff
and
the
first
commanding
officer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
constitution
permits
leafletting
a
base
by
a
member
of
the
military
to
the
effect
that
the
commanding
officer
of
this
base
is
lazy,
corrupt,
and
engaged
in
treasonable
conduct,
even
if
those
statements
might
be
proven
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reaction
of
people
to
leaflets
like
that
is
going
to
be
disruptive
to
order
on
the
base.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
commander
says
it
would?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
can't
prevent
in
advance
its
circulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
a
psychologist
i
have
no
reason
to
think
you're
a
psychologist.
whose
decision
should
prevail
if
it's
simply
a
question
of
psychological
prediction
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
leaflet
will
be?
