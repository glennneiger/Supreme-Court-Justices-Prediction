justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jones,
just
one
question.
under
either
of
your
first
two
submissions
on
the
statute,
you
would
require
us
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
saying
the
statute
does
not
protect
the
communications?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we
must
decide,
if
you
are
right,
whether
or
not
the
constitution,
independently
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
huff
case,
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
construe
the
statute
the
way
you
construe
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
are
we
not
necessarily
confronted
with
the
constitutional
question?
or
would
you
suggest
we
remand
and
ask
the
lower
court
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
went
on
the
statute,
the
case
can't
be
finally
decided
until
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
your
suggestion
that
we
then
remand
to
the
--
what
do
we
do
with
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
if
the
statute
doesn't
apply
and
if
the
regulation
is
attacked
as
unconstitutional,
which
i
understand
it
is,
then
don't
we
have
to
decide
it?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
--
you're
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
respect
is
the
constitutional
issue
different
in
this
case
from
the
preceding
case?
if
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
that
were
decided
in
your
favor,
we
certainly
wouldn't
have
to
address
it
here
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
vice
versa?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
this
difference
in
the
other
case,
as
i
understand
it,
you
contend
the
communication
was
improper,
but
here
wasn't
there
a
request
for
command
approval
which
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
they
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
with
respect
to
the
actual
litigation,
they
got
the
relief
they
wanted
here,
and
you
don't
challenge
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
it
that
the
man
--
i
am
trying
to
remember
the
facts
of
this
case
--
what
was
it
that
he
distributed
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
has
standing
because
it
might
be
applied
to
him
sometime
in
the
future?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
i
am
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wall,
that's
what
spock
decided,
according
to
the
dissenting
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it
did,
well
then,
you
lose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
mean
erroneously,
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it's
not
erroneous,
it
seems
to
me
you
do
lose.
