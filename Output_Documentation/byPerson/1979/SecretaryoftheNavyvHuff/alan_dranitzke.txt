mr.
alan
dranitzke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
the
huff
case,
unlike
the
glines
case,
is
simply
a
statutory
issue.
the
question
is
whether
certain
marine
and
navy
regulations
require
prior
command
approval
for
circulation
of
petitions
to
congress
by
service
personnel
on
base
overseas
violate
10
u.s.
code
section
1034.
our
position,
as
summarized,
is
first,
that
section
1034
includes
within
its
scope
both
individual
and
collective
petition
activities,
and
that
secondly,
the
regulations
under
attack
here
are
not
necessary
to
our
national
security.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
first
that
there
are
four
regulations
at
issue.
there
is
a
first
marine
aircraft
wing
order,
a
marine
corps
air
station
order,
fleet
marine
force
specific
order,
and
a
commander-in-chief
pacific
fleet
instruction.
these
four
regulations
cover
the
entire
western
pacific
for
both
marines
and
navy,
including
hawaii,
the
fleet
in
those
waters
and
any
of
those
ships
that
are
in
port
in
the
western
united
states.
in
pertinent
part
they
read
as
follows
"no
personnel
will
originate,
sign,
distribute,
or
promulgate
petitions
anywhere
within
a
foreign
country,
irrespective
of
uniform
or
duty
status,
unless
prior
command
approval
is
obtained."
in
other
words,
these
cover
all
petitioning
activities
whether
on
base,
off
base,
on
duty,
off
duty,
in
uniform
or
out
of
uniform.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
your
honor,
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
regulations
in
this
case
make
it
such
that
everything
we're
talking
about
is
in
a
foreign
country.
if
what
you're
referring
to
is
the
government's
footnote
in
glines
that
an
on-base
petitioning
activity,
out
of
uniform
and
off
duty,
is
permitted
without
prior
command
approval,
that's
a
misreading
of
the
regulations.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
the
pertinent
part
applies
in
a
foreign
country.
the
part
of
the
regulation
i
didn't
read
also
includes
prior
command
approval
upon
a
ship,
a
craft,
aircraft,
vehicle,
department
of
the
navy,
any
military
installation
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
it
is
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
it
was
unnecessary
because
the
prior
approval
requests
were
made
on
a
foreign
base.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
was
reading
directly
from
the
fleet
marine
force
specific
order,
which
was
the
order
picked
out
of
the
four
orders
by
the
court
of
appeals
below,
and
is
reprinted
both
in
the
government's
brief
and
our
brief
yes,
sir.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
section
1034,
which
states
no
person
may
restrict
any
member
of
an
armed
force
in
communicating
with
a
member
of
congress,
that
that
language
includes
within
its
scope
petitioning
activities,
that
if
you
give
petitioning
--
excuse
me,
communication
--
its
ordinary
meaning,
that
that
encompasses
petition;
that
the
traditional
method,
in
fact,
for
communicating
with
congress
is
petitioning.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
communications
is
a
broader
term
than
petition,
and
congress
did
not
want
to
eliminate
somebody
who
thought
they
were
not
writing
a
petition,
and
simply
a
letter,
from
writing
to
congress.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
admittedly
the
legislative
history
here
deals
with
the
individual
sailor
who
was
trying
to
write
to
his
congressman
and
the
navy
was
saying
no,
you
have
to
send
it
to
the
secretary
first.
however,
we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
word
"communication,"
you
take
its
ordinary
meaning,
it
means
petitioning.
the
department
of
defense
agrees
with
this.
in
1325.6
they
show
this
statute
as
being
a
basis
for
the
right
to
petition.
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
here,
article
1246,
which
was
one
of
the
concerns,
a
navy
regulation
was
entitled
communications
to
the
congress,
and
that
article
included
within
its
terms
the
right
to
petition,
so
that
it
seems
clear
that
both
in
terms
of
an
ordinary
meaning,
in
terms
of
dod
interpretation,
and
in
terms
of
the
contemporary
interpretation
today,
the
word
"communication"
includes
within
it
petitioning.
it
is
also
clear
that
contrary
to
the
government's
position
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
the
regulations
in
this
case
and
the
statute,
unlike
in
the
glines
case.
the
statute
says
that
there
shall
be
no
restriction,
there
shall
be
no
prior
review,
and
the
regulation
here
says
that
no
personnel
will
originate,
sign,
distribute,
or
promulgate
petitions.
in
other
words,
an
individual
member,
before
he
sits
down
and
sends
that
letter
and
signs
that
letter,
has
to
get
prior
command
approval.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
i
think
that's
the
clear
meaning.
it
says,
"no
personnel
will
sign
a
petition."
how
can
you
sit
down
and
write
this
letter
that
congress
is
supposedly
protecting
unless
you
get
prior
command
approval?
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
when
you're
writing
to
congress
it's
certainly
a
petition,
and
i
think
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
i
regard
it
as
both.
and
i
think
that
unlike
the
air
force
regulation
before
you,
in
glines,
which
specifically
speaks
to
group
petitioning
activities
as
requiring
prior
command
approval,
the
regulation
here
does
not
have
any
exception
of
that
nature,
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
here,
a
conflict
here
between
the
regulation
and
the
statute,
which
is
not
present
in
the
other
case.
furthermore
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute
encompasses,
when
we
say
petitioning,
that
it
encompasses
both
individual
and
collective
petition.
the
language
itself
is
not
limiting.
there
are
no
restrictions
as
to
what
an
individual
person
may
do
or
the
type
of
activity
in
terms
of
an
individual
or
collective
petition,
and
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
wording
of
the
individual
action.
the
intent
was
clear,
and
that
was
to
eliminate
prior
command
review.
and
the
court
below
found
that
there
was
no
indication
that
the
outer
limit
was
an
individual
petition,
and
the
court
in
allen
v.
monger,
which
is
pending
before
this
court,
also
looked
at
the
amendment
changes
to
the
statute,
the
historical
context,
and
concluded
similarly
that
the
scope
of
1034
was
beyond
an
individual
letter.
we
also
believe
that
the
statute
must
be
interpreted
as
found
by
the
court
below
in
the
light
of
the
long
and
cherished
tradition
in
this
country
of
the
right
to
petition
congress
for
redress
of
grievances.
the
government,
we
believe,
totally
ignores
this
argument.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
consistently
upheld
the
right
to
petition,
consistently
inveighed
against
prior
restraint.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
if
this
statute
is
to
be
properly
interpreted,
it
must
be
interpreted
in
this
light.
the
application
of
the
regulations
in
this
case
shows
that
1034
must
be
interpreted
to
include
individual
and
collective
petitioning,
and
that
these
protections
are
needed.
there
are
four
separate
fact
situations
that
we
would
like
to
refer
to.
first,
respondent
huff
requested
the
commander
of
the
first
marine
aircraft
wing
to
circulate
a
petition
to
senator
cranston
involving
the
use
of
military
in
labor
disputes.
he
wanted
to
circulate
that
in
the
barracks.
he
was
going
to
circulate
it
out
of
uniform,
off
duty,
no
use
of
government
materials,
he
wouldn't
interfere
with
military
personnel
on
duty.
in
fact,
all
requests
in
this
case
were
accompanied
by
similar
language.
three
weeks
later
that
request
was
denied,
the
commander
saying
the
petition
contained
gross
misstatements,
implications
of
law
as
fact,
as
well
as
impugning
by
innuendo
the
motives
and
conduct
of
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
armed
forces
in
the
exercise
of
his
constitutional
responsibilities."
to
authorize
permission
to
circulate
such
grossly
erroneous
and
misleading
commentary
would
be
contrary
to
my
responsibility
as
a
colander
to
maintain
good
order
and
discipline
and
afford
proper
guidance
to
the
men
under
my
command."
it's
clear
from
this
denial
that
in
fact
the
commanding
officer
was
denying
this
request
on
the
basis
of
the
content.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
is
important
about
the
facts
here
is
that
we
have
a
series
of
requests,
a
series
of
denials,
a
total
misuse
of
the
regulations,
concession
by
the
government
that
all
of
these
were
improper,
every
last
one
of
them,
and
it
shows
that
in
fact,
if
these
regulations
or
similar
type
regulations
are
going
to
be
in
existence,
that
the
right
to
petition
is
not
a
right
that
is
going
to
exist
within
the
military.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
to
the
extent
that
the
same
requirement
is
obtained
on
a
state-side
base,
i
think
the
answer
is
still
the
same.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
that
is
correct.
the
second
fact
situation
was,
the
respondent
falatine
requested
permission
to
circulate
a
petition
to
congressperson
dellums
in
support
of
amnesty,
and
on
the
same
day
that
the
huff
petition
was
denied,
the
commanding
officer
denied
that
petition
under
the
same
regulation
with
the
exact
same
reason
not
even
within
the
terms
of
the
regulation
that
he
was
supposedly
acting
under.
again,
a
clear
disagreement
of
the
content
of
what
was
being
distributed.
similarly,
respondent
gabrielson
requested
permission
to
distribute
a
letter
to
senator
fulbright
concerning
u.s.
support
for
the
government
of
south
korea.
he
requested
permission
to
distribute
this
in
the
barracks
and
around
the
barracks.
it
was
granted
with
regard
to
outside
the
barracks,
not
inside,
and
he
was
told
that
he
couldn't
argue
or
debate
while
distributing
this
letter,
and
no
reasons
were
given
for
these
restrictions.
the
fourth
example,
which
i
think
epitomizes
this
case,
huff
and
falatine
separately
requested
the
first
marine
aircraft
wing
commander
to
leaflet
the
base
with
a
leaflet
entitled,
"we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident,
but
do
the
brass?"
it
included
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
first
amendment,
and
their
commentary.
the
commanding
officer
denied
falatine's
request,
stating
that
the
introductory
paragraph
is
by
transparent
implication
disrespectful
and
contemptuous
of
all
your
superior
officers,
noncommissioned
officers,
civilians
and
the
like,
and
he
would
consider
the
distribution
a
clear
hazard
to
discipline
and
morale
within
the
first
marine
aircraft
wing,
yet
on
that
very
same
day
that
same
commanding
officer
permitted
huff
to
distribute
that
leaflet.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no,
we
complained
about
all
the
denials
in
the
case
and,
in
fact,
the
court
granted
declaratory
judgment
that
these
denials
were
unconstitutional
and
illegal
under
the
statute.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
as
long
as
that
activity
takes
place
in
a
way
that
does
not
disrupt
the
order
of
the
base
and
the
discipline
of
the
base,
that
can
be
taken
care
of
through
the
criminal
processes
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
that
yes,
an
enlisted
person
would
have
such
a
right.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
that
would,
unfortunately
in
the
situation,
have
to
be
a
command
decision.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
assume
necessarily
that
that
leaflet
will
disrupt
order
on
that
base.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
then
the
commander
would
be
free
to
bring
criminal
prosecution
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
well,
i
think
that
the
assumption
of
the
question
in
a
lot
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
minute
something
starts,
the
whole
structure
of
discipline
and
morale
fall,
and
i
think
that
is
a
false
assumption.
i
think
for
example
in
the
average
case,
he
drew
up
his
leaflet
and
in
fact
it
never
got
out
the
door.
he
was
arrested
and
dealt
with.
in
levy,
despite
the
statement
that
he
made,
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
fact
anyone
carried
through.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
if
the
first
amendment
is
to
have
any
meaning
in
the
military,
then
it
cannot
be
a
decision
solely
that
the
command
can
see
everything
ahead
of
time
and
pass
on
it,
and
engage
in
prior
restraint.
i
think
that
what
the
government's
position
comes
down
to
is
that
any
time
the
military
says
order,
preparedness,
discipline,
that
all
first
amendment
rights
disappear,
and
i
think
that
was
the
thrust
earlier
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
to
respondent
in
glines
concerning
mr.
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
spock.
and
that
is
if
every
time
the
military
comes
in
and
says
order,
things
stop,
then
there
is
no
room
for
the
first
amendment
in
the
military.
and
if
this
court
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
understand
that
that
is
what
the
dissenting
opinion
says.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
no,
not
necessarily
we
lose.
i
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
decision
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
decision
and
we
have
a
statutory
question
before
us.
the
question
that
i
was
addressed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
a
constitutional
question.
i
think
we
have
a
statute
here,
a
statute
in
which
congress
said
there
is
not
to
be
prior
restraint.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
and
that's
our
point,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no.
i
think
that
the
government
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
mr.
chief
justice,
with
regard
to
the
petition
issue
before
the
court,
the
answer
is
no.
the
government
has
stood
up
here
and
talked
about
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes.
you
can
talk
on
base,
there's
been
discussion
during
the
prior
argument,
you
can
all
get
together
and
talk
about
lousy
food,
there
are
magazines
and
newspapers
that
regularly
come
on
base,
there
are
--
any
time
there
is
the
basis,
the
factual
basis
for
complaints
and
discontent,
there
is
going
to
be
first
amendment
activity
of
one
kind
or
another,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
position,
the
government
can
take
the
position
that
somehow
petitioner
is
more
dangerous,
is
going
to
produce
more
results
in
terms
of
upsetting
morale
and
discipline.
i
think
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
am
relying
on
1034.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
the
language
says
no
person
may
restrict
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
any
member
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
first
they
are
not
necessarily
talking
about
a
one-on-one
contact,
that
as
the
court
below
found,
that
is
not
the
outer
limit
of
the
language.
i
think
that
they
certainly
are
not
talking
about
what
any
one
member
may
do
versus
other
members
in
terms
of
collecting
signatures.
i
also
feel
--
although
you
indicated
earlier
you
disagree
--
that
the
regulations
here
would
require
an
individual
to
obtain
the
commander's
signature
before
sending
off
his
letter
of
petition
to
his
congressman.
i
think
additionally
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
it
is
our
contention
furthermore
that
the
regulations
here
and
the
statute
don't
mesh
the
way
they
do
in
glines,
that
an
individual
writing
his
congressman
in
this
case
would
require
command
approval
before
he
signs
that
letter.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is.
and
i
also
think
it
is
a
rule
of
construction
that
a
statute
should
be
read
in
a
way
so
as
not
to
inhibit
first
amendment
rights,
and
that
is
our
contention
here.
i
think
furthermore,
with
regard
to
the
government's
contention
about
national
security,
that
despite
the
affidavit
that
they
have
introduced
in
this
case,
that
this
is
a
combat
ready
base
and
you
need
such
a
regulation,
that
in
fact
you
had
a
three
and
a
half
year
period
in
this
case
where
the
government
has
never
come
to
court
and
asked
for
a
stay
of
the
order
below,
and
i
think
this
belies
the
allegations
of
the
government
in
this
case
that
national
security
requires
this
regulation.
we
had
a
district
court
judge
in
may
of
'76
decide
that
all
of
the
four
regulations
covering
the
entire
western
pacific
are
unconstitutional,
violated
1034,
and
specifically
enjoined
the
entire
iwakuni
air
base
personnel
from
requiring
prior
command
approval,
and
yet
the
government
has
never
once
come
into
court
and
asked
for
a
stay
of
this
declaration
or
of
this
injunction.
apparently
things
have
gone
on
at
the
iwakuni
air
base
without
the
government
finding
the
need
to
come
into
court
and
say,
oh,
no
we
need
these
regulations.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
that's
correct.
in
fact,
that
was
the
rationale
that
the
navy
used
at
the
time
this
was
enacted,
and
all
they
were
trying
to
do
was
find
out
what
was
going
on.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no,
i
think
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
our
position
is
the
government
is
not
helpless
in
this
situation.
the
government
has
two
things
at
its
disposal
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
if
it
is
of
a
nature
that
would
violate
one
of
the
code
sections
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
in
fact,
that
is
what
this
court
had
before
it
in
average
and
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
that
is
certainly
the
basis
on
which
the
commander
brings
criminal
proceedings,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
the
military
has
a
whole
range
of
criminal
sanctions
here.
they
are
set
out
in
the
beginning
of
our
brief
as
an
appendix
to
1325
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
it
is
certainly
our
position,
that
to
require
submission,
whether
approval
or
showing,
is
a
restriction
and
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
the
statute
being
passed.
i
think
that
furthermore
the
military
is
not
without
the
ability
to
promulgate
proper
regulations
regarding
time,
place
and
manner.
but
to
have
a
prior
restraint
is
not
time,
place
and
manner.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
think
that
a
commander
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
the
military
court
martial
process
permits
such
response
and
i
think
that
helps
prove
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
below
and
that
is
that
the
military
criminal
process
in
fact
is
quite
powerful
and
can
certainly
deal
with
the
issues
that
the
government
thinks
are
necessary
here
for
purposes
of
national
security.
with
regard
to
greer
v.
spock,
it
is
our
position
that
that
was
a
constitutionally
based
opinion
in
which
the
authority
of
the
military
to
prohibit
civilians
on
base
was
basically
involved,
that
what
you
have
here
is
a
case
of
military
personnel
attempting
to
circulate
petitions.
furthermore,
in
greer
there
was
no
attempt
to
request
permission,
there
was
not
a
regulation
there
which
involved
petitioning.
here
we
have
a
specific
enactment
by
the
congress
which
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
military
for
the
purposes
of
giving
them
the
right
to
freely
petition
their
representatives
in
congress.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no,
i
believe
that
this
court
is
then
faced
with
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
then
i
think
that
greer
presents
greater
problems.
i
think
that
greer
is
a
decision
that
for
the
most
part
had
to
do
with
civilians'
access
to
base,
it
had
to
do
with
political
neutrality
of
the
military
and
those
factors
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
have
no
idea,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
military
would
think
about
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
--
which
would
be
more
disruptive.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
no.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
don't
know
as
a
private
what
i
would
think
with
regard
to
those
distributions.
i
certainly
think
that
--
mr.
alan
dranitzke
i
don't
know
what
the
military
is
entitled
to
think,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
can
say
that
that
issue
though
is
not
involved
in
any
of
these
cases
because
the
regulations
here
in
question
do
not
in
any
way
stop
a
top
sergeant
or
a
commander
from
asking
for
prior
approval
to
circulate
a
petition.
mr.
alan
dranitzke
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
simply
saying
that
any
rule
which
comes
out
of
the
decisions
of
these
two
cases
will
have
the
same
effect
with
regard
to
a
private
or
a
top
sergeant
or
a
commander.
thank
you.
