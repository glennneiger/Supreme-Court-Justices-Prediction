chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
oral
argument
next
in
78-599,
secretary
of
the
navy
v.
huff.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dranitzke.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
paraphrasing
the
5370.3
with
your
summary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
what
you're
saying
is,
congress
meant
to
include
in
1034
petitions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
members
of
congress
are
familiar
with
the
constitutional
reference
to
the
right
to
petition
congress.
isn't
it
arguable
that
if
they
meant
petitions,
they
would
have
used
the
term
in
1034?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
both
chairman
vinson
and
congressman
byrnes
spoke
in
terms
of
a
man
sitting
down
with
a
pencil
and
writing
a
letter
to
his
congressman,
which
is
clearly
an
exercise
of
the
right
to
petition
congress,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
3(b)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
the
prohibition
against
pro-magazines,
handbills,
flyers,
means
you
can't
write
an
individual
letter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
ordinarily
think
of
a
letter
from
a
single
individual
to
another
individual
as
a
petition,
except
in
the
very
generic
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
exercising
your
right
of
petition,
perhaps,
but
if
you
write
your
congressman,
do
you
regard
that
as
a
petition?
or
a
letter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
read
the
government's
briefs
the
way
you
do,
counsel.
government
didn't
say
that
the
whole
military
and
defense
operation
is
going
to
fall
apart
on
circulation
on
any
one
of
these
acts.
it
said
that
these
regulations,
these
prohibitions
are
there
because
these
kinds
of
things
have
a
tendency
to
break
down
morale,
discipline,
and
so
forth,
not
that
any
one
of
them
--
the
government
could
never
in
the
world
prove
that
any
one
of
these
petitions
or
any
ten
of
them
collectively
would
destroy
the
discipline
in
the
particular
military
unit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
they
can
make
regulations
prohibiting
conduct
which
reasonably
has
a
tendency
to
produce
that
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
they
can't
make
regulations
which
prohibit
conduct
which
has
a
tendency
to
produce
that
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
refer
to
the
statute
in
response
to
that
last
question,
what
statute
particularly
and
what
language
in
that
statute
are
you
relying
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
language?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
does
any
member
mean
anything
other
than
any
member?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
communicating
with
a
member
of
congress,
aren't
they
talking
about
a
one-on-one
communication
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
that
last
--
if
you
will
tell
me
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
statute,
if
you
read
it
that
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
read
regulations
which
are
promulgated
pursuant
to
a
statute
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
statute
if
it
is
possible
to
do
so?
isn't
that
a
rule
of
construction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
between
a
civilian,
a
dr.
spock
circulating
some
material
on
a
base
and
a
major
or
a
captain,
which
would
the
military
be
entitled
to
think
would
be
more
disruptive
of
military
discipline
and
morale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
come,
come,
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
any
idea
which?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
say
you
were
a
private
first
class,
which
would
you
be
more
impressed
by,
dr.
spock
or
the
major's
view
or,
as
someone
suggested
in
the
other
case,
the
master
sergeant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
the
military
is
entitled
to
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
without
prior
approval
is
all
we
are
talking
about
here,
aren't
we?
i
take
all
your
remarks
to
be
directed
at
the
prior
restraint,
which
you
have
emphasized
constantly
that
requiring
prior
approval
means
prior
restraint.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
