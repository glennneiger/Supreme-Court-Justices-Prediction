justice
byron
r.
white
apart
from
the
declaratory
judgment
holding
it
--
but
i
mean
in
terms
of,
i
am
trying
to
remember
the
facts
here
you
conceded
here
that
either
under
the
regulation
or
under
the
constitution,
i
can't
remember
which,
the
military
could
not
prevent
the
communication?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
would
also
foreclose
any
regulation
that
said
that
anyone
who
wants
to
send
a
petition
to
his
congressman
must
first
show
it
to
the
commanding
officer?
he
needn't
get
any
approval
of
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
you
would
know
what
is
going
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
also
i
suppose
say
that
if
the
commanding
officer
just
happened
to
find
out
about
the
petition
and
thought
that
the
petition
was
not
protected
by
the
statute,
that
he
nevertheless
couldn't
take
the
petition
out
of
circulation
pending
disciplinary
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
it
hasn't
been
determined
judicially.
it
has
just
been
the
opinion
of
the
commanding
officer
that
the
petition
is
unprotected
by
1034.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
commanding
officer,
instead
of
being
able
to
disapprove
it,
can
just
bring
disciplinary
proceedings
and
stop
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
in
the
commander's
opinion
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
or
anybody
else
ever
claim
in
this
case
that
a
petition
such
as
involved
in
this
case
really
didn't
restrict
communications
with
a
congressman
until
and
unless
permission
is
refused?
is
it
your
position
--
does
everybody
agree
that
it
is
a
restriction
within
the
meaning
of
1034
just
to
require
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
pretty
prior
restraint
to
take
the
petition
out
of
circulation
pending
military
discipline.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
hasn't
been
any
adjudication
or
anything,
you
just
take
it
out
of
circulation.
