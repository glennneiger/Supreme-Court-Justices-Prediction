ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
commonwealth
seeks
review
of
an
order
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
requiring
suppression
of
a
confession
of
certain
real
evidence
which
was
obtained
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
based
upon
that
confession
and
a
subsequent
and
culpatory
statement
by
the
defendant
to
his
mother.
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
requires
such
suppression.
i
shall
limit
discussion
of
the
facts
to
those
surrounding
the
confession
since
the
legality
of
the
arrest
is
not
at
issue.
the
body
of
the
victim
was
discovered
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
june
11,
1976.
after
being
informed
by
neighbors
that
they
heard
a
scream
and
seen
a
young
man,
approximately
five-foot-ten,
wearing
dungarees
and
with
his
shirtsleeves
rolled
up,
leaving
the
scene,
the
police
conducted
general
inquiries
as
to
young
men
who
were
known
to
frequent
that
particular
area.
these
inquiries
took
place
at
the
police
station.
one
young
man
said
that
he
knew
the
victim
and
that
he
had
seen
her
sitting
on
some
church
steps
with
a
young
man
in
his
teens,
with
dark
hair,
who
was
at
that
time
shirtless.
another
young
man
came
to
the
station,
one
john
carroll,
who
told
the
police
that
he
knew
the
victim
and
that
he
had
seen
her
on
those
church
steps
with
joseph
meehan.
as
he
was
telling
the
police
this,
he
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
joseph
meehan
hitch-hiking
on
the
street
outside.
he
told
the
police
this,
they
immediately
exited
the
station,
went
to
mr.
meehan,
told
him
of
their
general
investigations
and
asked
him
to
accompany
them
to
the
police
station.
he
agreed
after
first
noting
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
unemployment
office
either
to
pick
up
his
check
or
to
appeal
the
denial
of
benefits.
he
accompanied
the
police
to
the
station
and
a
detective
solari
began
asking
him
general
questions
when
he
noticed
what
appeared
to
him
was
blood
on
the
defendant's
sneakers.
he
mentioned
this
to
the
defendant
who
stated,
no,
it
was
mud,
but
that
if
it
were
blood
in
any
event
he
had
gotten
the
blood
in
a
fight
with
one
george
quish
the
previous
tuesday.
the
detective
asked
mr.
meehan
for
the
sneaker
and
he
gave
it
to
the
detective
who
left
the
room.
as
it
happened,
frank
quish
was
also
being
questioned
at
the
station
at
this
time
and
he
denied
having
the
fight
with
joseph
meehan.
another
officer
looked
at
the
sneaker
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
blood.
this
was
later
confirmed
by
the
police
chemist
that
afternoon.
detective
solari
returned
to
the
defendant,
advised
him
of
his
rights
under
miranda
and
advised
him
that
he
was
under
arrest.
at
11:20,
officer
kelley
commenced
an
interrogation
of
the
defendant.
this
interrogation
was
recorded.
the
interrogation
began
with
the
full
recitation
of
the
miranda
rights
again,
and
the
defendant
responded
that
he
understood
them.
he
did
respond,
"right,"
"yes,"
one
word
responses,
and
he
agreed
to
speak
about
the
victim.
the
defendant
first
denied
he
knew
her
and
then
agreed
that
he
knew
her
generally,
had
seen
her
around
town
but
that
he
had
last
seen
her
on
the
previous
tuesday.
this
is
a
friday
morning.
the
officer
mentioned
the
blood
on
his
sneakers
and
the
defendant
respond
that
it
had
come
from
a
fight
on
tuesday.
the
officer
said
it
was
too
fresh
to
have
gotten
there
on
tuesday
and
the
defendant
suggested
the
freshness
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
swimming
the
day
before
but
that
he
had
last
seen
her
on
tuesday.
the
officer
then
advised
him
that
witnesses
had
seen
them
together
last
night.
he
suggested
that
this
was
serious
and
said,
"i
think
truth
is
the
best
thing
at
this
time,
the
victim
is
dead
and
you
are
under
arrest."
the
defendant
said,
"under
arrest
for
what?"
and
the
officer
said,
"for
the
death,
for
the
murder,
and
we
have
witnesses
who
saw
you
together."
the
defendant
then
asked
if
he
could
see
those
witnesses
and
the
officer
declined
to
do
that
at
that
time.
he
then
admitted
that
he
had
in
fact
been
with
the
victim
the
previous
night,
that
they
had
met
in
a
bar,
that
they
had
two
beers,
that
they
discussed
getting
some
pot
or
marihuana
and
that
they
left
the
bar
around
11:30
or
so
and
had
proceeded
to
the
church
steps
where
they
sat
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
but
then
that
he
had
left
and
the
victim
had
gone
in
one
direction
and
he
had
gone
in
another.
after
some
discussion
about
what
the
victim
had
been
wearing
at
this
time,
the
defendant
blurted
out,
"i
was
whacked
out
last
night."
he
then
talked
about
having
taken
pills,
some
15
valiums
of
5
milligrams
each,
he
specified
the
milligrams,
and
that
they
had
been
drinking
beer,
but
he
continued
to
deny
that
anything
had
happened
between
he
and
the
victim.
at
this
point
there
is
a
pause
in
the
interrogation
and
another
detective
suggests
that
the
defendant
had
asked
him
what
bearing
it
would
have
if
he
told
them
what
had
happened,
what
degree
it
would
be.
the
police
responded
that
they
had
no
control
over
that,
and
sgt.
kelley
responded,
"i
can't
promise
you
anything,
i
have
no
jurisdiction
over
anything
like
that,"
that
he
would
inform
the
district
attorney
and
the
court
and
defense
counsel
of
cooperation,
but
said,
"i
can't
say
you
are
going
to
get
a
break."
he
continued,
"all
i
can
promise
you
is
that
i
will
make
your
cooperation
known,
but
again
i
can't
promise
you
anything."
he
then
continued,
"if
you
wish
to
tell
the
truth
of
what
happened,
then
i
can
say
in
all
fairness
it
will
probably
help
your
defense.
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know?"
the
defendant
asked
if
he
could
go
home
and
get
some
clothes
and
the
officer
said
that
he
would
get
them,
that
the
police
would
get
them,
and
then
referring
to
the
drinking
of
the
night
before,
asked
the
defendant
if
he
were
still
high.
the
defendant
responded,
"a
little
jiggy,"
but
then
said
that
he
could
understand
what
was
going
on.
the
officer
again
said
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
his
words
are
"a
little
jiggy"
your
honor.
the
officer
again
asked
if
he
wanted
to
tell
him
what
the
story
was
and
the
defendant
said,
"yes.
but
if
i
tell
you,
is
it
going
to
come
out
in
court?"
the
officer
said
it
will
anyway,
we
have
a
good
case
and
my
suggestion
is
that
the
truth
is
going
to
make
a
good
defense
in
this
particular
case.
the
defendant
responded,
"i
don't
know."
the
officer
asked,
"you
don't
know
what?
do
you
want
to
tell
us
about
it?"
and
then
said,
"did
you
say
she
provoked
you?
is
that
my
understanding?"
the
defendant
responded,
"yes."
and
the
officer
advised
him
to
tell
the
story
in
his
own
words
and
the
defendant,
stating
that
he
had
been
high
on
valium
and
drunk,
stated
he
flipped
out
when
she
made
fun
of
him
and
then
proceeded
to
confess
and
describe
the
events
surrounding
the
killing.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

it
is
all
on
the
tape
record,
your
honor.
while
the
interrogation

ms.
barbara

h.
smith
she
was
somewhat
older,
i
believe.
i
don't
think
that
came
out
in
the
probable
cause
hearing.
somewhere
between
18
and
20
years
old
i
think
would
be
fair
to
say.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
and
it
is

an
hour
or
somewhat
less
than
an
hour.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
there
is
a
duty
under
massachusetts
law
to
tell
him
of
the
right
to
use
the
telephone.
i
don't
think
the
failure
--
and
it
would
appear
on
the
record
there
was
no
such
advice
--
renders
the
statement
involuntary.
i
also
would
suggest
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
police
under
the
statute
should
have
told
him
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--
after
he
was
taken
into
custody
and
he
had
the
right
to
make
a
phone
call
i
believe
within
one
hour
after
that
time.
so
that
would
be
--
i
would
say
they
should
have
told
him
at
the
initiation
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

--
of
the
questioning.
ms.

yes.

after
he
was
arrested,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

it
was
found
that
he
voluntarily
went
to
the
police
station.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

that's
correct.

ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
after
the
formal
arrest.
while
this
interrogation
was
in
progress,
officer
solari
who
had
received
the
sneaker
from
the
defendant
went
to
court
in
order
to
secure
a
search
warrant.
while
he
was
there,
he
was
advised
by
telephone
of
the
confession
and
included
the
fact
of
the
confession
in
the
affidavit
to
support
probable
cause
for
the
search
warrant,
admitting
the
reference
to
the
bloody
sneakers
and
the
other
identification
of
the
defendant,
a
pair
of
blood-stained
dungarees
recovered
from
the
defendant's
home.
at
approximately
4:00
p.m.,
the
defendant's
mother
and
brother
arrived
at
the
police
station
and
were
escorted
to
the
defendant's
cell.
as
they
approached
he
blurted
out,
"ma,
i
didn't
mean
to
hit
her
so
hard."
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
and
in
an
affidavit
stated
his
grounds,
his
prior
ingestion
of
alcohol
and
drugs
and
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
a
right
or
a
need
of
a
lawyer
and
he
was
frightened.
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
the
confession
must
be
suppressed
as
involuntary
and
that
the
dungarees
must
be
suppressed
on
the
grounds
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
therefore
directly
offensive
to
the
fifth
amendment,
and
that
the
afternoon
statement
must
also
be
suppressed
under
the
"cat
out
of
the
bag"
theory.
the
common
law
submits
that
the
lower
court
has
misconstrued
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
police
interrogation
and
it
has
based
its
decision
on
a
misconstruction
of
the
scope
and
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
context
of
police
interrogation.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
oh,
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
thank
you.
in
holding
the
confession
--
as
discussed
earlier
--
holding
that
that
confession
must
be
suppressed,
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
initially
referred
to
that
portion
of
miranda
which
places
a
heavy
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
however,
the
court
continued
stating
that
rather
than
basing
on
the
lack
of
an
effective
waiver,
they
found
the
confession
to
be
involuntary
and
directly
offensive
to
the
firth
amendment.
it
is
the
common
law's
position
that
it
is
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
deemed
to
have
been
offended
by
the
conduct
here,
that
actual
official
compulsion
or
coercion
must
be
demonstrated,
and
that
this
cannot
be
accomplished
merely
by
aiding
together
a
number
of
factors
which
are
not
in
themselves
coercive.
the
factors
considered
below
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
only
in
establishing
a
setting
in
which
actual
coercion
might
have
been
exerted
to
overcome
the
will
of
the
suspect.
thus,
two
circumstances
are
necessary.
one,
an
act
of
coercion
by
an
official
and
a
setting,
and
then
i
believe
the
compulsion
or
the
pressure
exerted
by
the
police
is
measured
in
terms
of
the
setting
or
the
totality
of
the
attendant
circumstances
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
act
is
sufficient
to
have
overcome
the
will
of
a
defendant
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
believe
that
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
a
fifth
amendment
context
to
demonstrate
any
actual
compulsion.
they
seem
to
go
along
on
a
view
that
viewed
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
terms
of
the
age
and
condition
of
the
defendant
and
then
reached
a
conclusion
that
somehow
this
isn't
fair
and
make
a
leap
to
actual
compulsion.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
wrong
legal
standard,
that
they
did
not
properly
apply
the
fifth
amendment
which
by
its
own
terms
addresses
compelled
testimony.
and
my
position
is
that
the
actual
compulsion
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
looked
at
all
the
circumstances
and
the
language
in
the
opinion
is
not
that
the
will
was
overcome
but
his
ability
i
believe
to
make
a
decision
was
undermined.
now,
this
i
do
not
believe
constitutes
compulsion
or
involuntariness
as
contemplated
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
factors
that
the
court
relied
upon
are
not
in
themselves
coercive
and
the
police
practices
involved
are
not
constitutionally
forbidden.
the
defendant
was
18
years
of
age,
he
had
completed
the
ninth
grade
and
two
years
of
high
school.
and
while
it
was
true
he
was
not
specifically
informed
of
his
statutory
right
to
use
the
phone,
he
was
twice
informed
of
his
right
to
speak
with
an
attorney
and
have
an
attorney
present
with
him.
as
to
his
psychological
condition,
assuming
that
he
had
voluntarily
ingested
alcohol
and
drugs
the
night
before,
the
defendant
also
testified
at
the
probable
cause
hearing
that
he
had
been
using
drugs
since
the
age
of
14,
and
it
suggested
that
the
voluntary
use
of
drugs
does
not
allow
one
to
avoid
responsibility
for
the
criminal
acts
and
i
suggest
that
it
does
not
permit
one
to
avoid
accountability
for
their
own
words.
and
in
this
case
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
defendant
was
rendered
incapable
of
making
a
voluntary
decision
when
the
court
below
found
that
the
defendant
had
voluntary
accompanied
the
police
to
the
station,
that
he
had
voluntary
given
up
the
sneakers.
moreover,
the
defendant
was
sufficiently
rational
as
to
have
formed
an
intent
to
go
to
the
unemployment
office
either
to
pick
up
his
check
or
to
challenge
the
denial
of
his
benefits.
he
is
quite
capable
of
answering
general
questions
as
to
his
name,
his
address,
he
described
the
physical
structure
of
his
home.
he
was
capable
of
thinking
of
rational
explanations
to
explain
the
condition
of
his
sneakers.
he
corrected
sgt.
kelley
on
several
occasions,
both
as
to
his
correct
name
when
the
sergeant
referred
to
him
as
robert,
he
said
no,
it
was
joseph.
he
corrected
the
sergeant
as
to
the
name
of
the
bar
he
had
been
in
with
the
victim,
and
he
questioned
the
sergeant
as
to
whether
it
was
one
or
both
of
his
sneakers
which
were
blood-stained.
moreover,
he
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
try
to
mitigate
his
conduct
by
offering
the
excuse
that
he
had
been
whacked
out,
drunk,
and
that
he
flipped
out
after
the
victim
had
made
fun
of
him.
moreover,
the
police
testified
that
he
exhibited
no
aberrational
conduct
at
the
police
station,
that
his
eyes
were
not
glassy,
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
walking.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
tape
supports
that
view.
in
addition,
a
doctor
who
listened
to
the
tape
testified
that
there
were
no
apparent
drug
effects.
so
there
we
have
conditions
which
might,
if
there
were
actual
coercion,
tend
to
magnify
that
coercion
into
some
kind
of
unconstitutionally
permissible
behavior,
but
here
we
have
no
actual
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
police.
they
are
criticized
in
addition
for
having
conducted
a
skillful
investigation,
for
making
a
misrepresentation
as
to
the
number
of
identifying
witnesses.
in
frazier
v.
cupp,
the
defendant
was
falsely
told
that
his
codefendant
had
confessed
and
it
was
sympathetically
suggested
to
him
that
it
had
been
the
victim
who
had
promoted
the
fight
that
led
to
the
killing.
neither
of
these
practices
were
found
to
be
coercive
by
this
court,
and
neither
were
held
sufficient
to
render
a
statement
involuntary.
a
suggestion
to
tell
the
truth,
especially
when
it
is
not
made
in
a
threatening
context,
does
not
constitute
coercion
under
the
case
law.
indeed,
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
every
element
which
influences
a
defendant
to
incriminate
himself.
if
it
did,
i
think
we
would
have
to
totally
do
away
with
police
interrogation.
finally,
the
police
made
no
promises
to
the
defendant.
they
specifically
advised
him
on
more
than
three
occasions
that
they
could
make
no
promises.
therefore,
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
there
are
no
acts
of
official
compulsion,
and
furthermore
that
the
suggestion
that
the
concept
of
police
interrogation
is
in
itself
inherently
compulsion
cannot
furnish
this
necessary
factor
to
a
finding
of
involuntariness.
in
miranda,
in
extending
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
context
of
police
interrogation,
the
court
posited
the
factual
premise
that
the
police
interrogation
was
inherently
coercive.
the
safeguards
of
the
warning
requirements
of
miranda
were
then
designed
to
dispel
that
inherent
coercion.
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
clear
that
those
safeguards
were
complied
with.
he
was
fully
advised
of
his
miranda
warnings.
therefore,
the
inherent
compulsion
of
police
interrogation
must
be
deemed
to
have
been
dispelled
and
cannot
be
utilized
to
provide
the
necessary
factor
of
actual
official
coercion.
the
court
generally
stated
in
united
states
v.
washington
in
the
context
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding
that
any
possible
coercion
or
unfairness
resulting
from
a
defendant
or
a
witness'
misimpression
that
he
must
necessarily
tell
the
truth
is
completely
removed
by
the
warnings.
in
this
case,
the
warnings
were
fully
given.
also
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
recently
has
rejected
the
factual
premise
of
inherent
coercion
in
police
interrogations.
primarily
in
michigan
v.
tucker,
rather
than
view
police
interrogation
as
inherently
coercive,
the
court
focused
on
basic
traditional
fifth
amendment
considerations
in
finding
that
the
police
conduct
in
michigan
did
not
deprive
respondent
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
such,
even
though
there
was
a
disregard
of
miranda.
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
were
of
the
continued
view
that
custodial
interrogation
itself
supplied
the
compulsion
necessary
to
involve
the
firth
amendment,
the
question
of
the
degree
of
compulsion
or
the
particular
acts
of
the
police
involved
would
not
arise.
most
importantly,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
cases
holding
that
statements
taken
involving
violation
of
miranda
are
not
per
se
inadmissible
at
trial
for
all
purposes.
in
harris
v.
new
york
and
oregon
v.
hass,
the
court
focused
on
whether
the
trustworthiness
of
the
statements
satisfied
legal
standards.
an
inquiry
into
trustworthiness,
at
least
under
the
rule
of
rogers
v.
richmond,
is
irrelevant,
that
the
question
is
only
whether
the
statements
were
involuntary.
therefore,
we
suggest
that
if
custodial
interrogation
itself
does
not
render
a
statement
involuntary
in
a
fundamental
constitutional
sense
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
was
that
decided
under
the
firth
amendment,
your
honor?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
think
that
is
another
consideration.
now,
the
court
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
this
court
directly
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
but
i
am
merely
replying
as
to
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
said,
and
they
said
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
but
in
their
reasoning
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion,
they
not
only
stated
that
it
was
directly
offensive
to
the
fifth
amendment
but
used
that
amendment
as
the
basis
to
exclude
automatically
the
real
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant.
and
i
suggest
that,
yes,
it
is
due
process
which
controls.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
fourteenth.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
court
must
be
referring
to
either
one
of
two
circumstances
which
they
set
out
as
a
factor
leading
to
their
finding
of
involuntariness.
one,
the
police
represented
that
witnesses
had
identified
meehan
as
being
with
the
victim
when
in
fact
it
is
only
one
witness
which
specifically
named
meehan,
as
knowing
meehan
as
being
with
the
victim.
the
other
witness
described
him
as
a
young
man,
he
did
not
know
his
name.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
certainly
the
import
of
their
decision
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
and
even
when
the
second
confession
as
in
this
case
involved
no
conduct
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
police,
it
was
simply
a
spontaneous
expression
of
regret
to
his
mother
who
happened
to
be
overheard
by
the
police
who
were
standing
in
the
in
the
carter
outside
the
cell.
there
was
no
police
involvement
at
all
in
this
confession,
yet
our
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
it
must
be
suppressed.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
as
to
your
first
question,
i
think
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case
either
in
the
briefs
or
argument
or
in
the
supreme
court's
decision
that
it
is
based
upon
the
massachusetts
amendment.
those
cases
referred
to
by
the
court
themselves
rely
upon
massachusetts
interpretation
of
federal
constitutional
law.
now,
as
to
the
effect
of
the
failure
to
warn
about
the
telephone,
that
has
never
been
held
in
massachusetts
to
require
the
suppression
of
a
statement.
and
i
would
suggest
there
are
cases
in
this
court
which
have
held
that
the
violation
of
a
state
statute,
particularly
in
terms
of
bringing
one
before
a
magistrate
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
does
not
require
or
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
it
as
a
factor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
yes,
your
honor,
but
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
think
that
is
true,
and
i
think
it
will
indicates
just
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
this
factor
in
the
absence
of
any
additional
evidence
that
the
police
failed
to
make
this
news
available
to
the
defendant
in
the
course
of
trying
to
keep
him
incommunicado
position.
i
think
these
factors
have
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
what
in
fact
actually
happened,
what
were
the
police
doing.
i
mean
was
there
ever
any
evidence
in
this
case
of
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
isolate
the
defendant
and
to
continue
prolonged
interrogation
of
him
in
that
isolated
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
immediately.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
as
to
the
real
evidence,
the
dungarees,
the
court
below
held
that
they
must
be
suppressed
because
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
directly
offensive
to
the
fifth
amendment.
assuming
such
a
violation,
the
exclusionary
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
extend
to
the
instant
situation.
the
fifth
amendment
historically
and
by
its
terms
speaks
to
the
use
of
testimony
compelled
under
oath
at
trial.
here
it
is
not
testimony
that
is
sought
to
be
used
at
trial
but
real
evidence,
and
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
direct
itself
or
bar
the
compulsion
of
real
physical
evidence
as
evidence
in
schmerber
and
that
line
of
cases.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
fifth
amendment
only
addresses
itself
to
one
compelled
testimonial
evidence
and
it
precludes
its
use
at
trial,
and
i
would
say
that
it
does
not
address
itself
to
physical
evidence
that
is
sought
to
be
introduced
at
trial.
and
i
think
that
the
suggestion
of
counsel
that
we
extend
the
principle
of
counselman
v.
hitchcock
is
without
justification.
the
underlying
considerations
of
the
privilege
in
the
judicial
context
are
different
from
here.
and
one
final
point
is
that
even
when
this
court
has
ordered
suppression
of
physical
evidence,
they
focus
on
the
purpose
and
flagrancy
of
police
interrogation,
and
here
the
intent
was
merely
to
solve
an
unsolved
crime
to
determine
the
truth
surrounding
a
death,
and
it
cannot
be
said
here,
as
it
was
in
spano
and
haynes
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
commonwealth
v.
white,
your
honor.
in
that
case
though,
that
was
purely
only
a
miranda
waiver
question.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
only
if
one
views
the
fifth
amendment
as
totally
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
fruit,
no.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
definitely,
miranda
wouldn't
be
a
fruit
because
there
would
be
no
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
court
summarily
affirmed
divided
four-to-four
last
year.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
so
this
question
is
still
open.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
four
people
did
agree
with
us,
too,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
unfortunately,
the
police
officer
didn't
put
that
in
the
affidavit
after
he
received
notice
that
he
had
confessed.
he
had
that
information.
he
was
the
officer
who
took
the
sneaker.
he
also
had
the
information
that
the
victim
has
been
identified
as
being
with
mr.
meehan.
unfortunately
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
this
case
has
not
gone
to
trial,
your
honor.
we
just
had
a
probable
cause
hearing.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
opinion
notes
the
blood
stains,
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
right,
blood
stains
on
the
sneakers
and
blood
stains
on
the
dungarees
that
were
seized
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
it
talked
about
the
neighbors'
description
of
the
defendant,
and
it
omitted
evidence
which
was
in
the
knowledge
of
the
police
officer
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
noted
that
they
had
sufficient
evidence,
sufficient
probable
cause
to
have
obtained
the
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that's
simply
it,
the
police
could
have
come
by
the
dungarees
independently
of
the
confession.
they
had
the
probable
cause.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
but
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
ruled
that
all
of
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
sir.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
on
page
77
of
the
appendix,
your
honor,
"so
the
question
is
raised,
whether
the
warrant
can
legalize
the
seizure
of
the
dungarees
when
it
is
held
that
the
confession
must
be
suppressed."
ms.

ms.

pardon
me,
your

ms.

ms.

ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
your
honor,
that
has
been
the
commonwealth's
contention
throughout,
that
supposedly
due
process.
if
we
agree
that
the
answer
is
no
as
to
the
dungarees
--
and
this
is
explained
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
thus
directly
offensive
to
the
fifth
amendment,
they
then
go
on
to
discuss
the
conditions
in
commonwealth
v.
white
where
the
finding
had
only
been
the
lack
of
a
waiver
under
miranda.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.

thank
you.
