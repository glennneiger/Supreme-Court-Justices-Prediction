the
fifth
amendment
to
a
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall

what
was
your
position
before
the
court?
justice

justice
thurgood
marshall
or
the
next
court.
are
you
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
need
the
fifth
amendment?
you've
got
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
as
applied
to
a
state
and
you've
got
opinions
of
this
court
using
due
process
as
applied
to
the
state.
haley
v.
ohio,
which
you
have
in
your
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute,
you
agreed
real
fast
there.
suppose
somebody
comes
in
and
he
confesses
to
the
crime,
could
they
put
that
in
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
sent
it
to
trial
now
and
tomorrow
morning
somebody
confesses,
you
can't
say
now
what
evidence
will
be
in
that
next
trial,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
just
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
they
also
say
at
least
three
or
more
times
that,
you
know,
we
can't
do
anything
about
that?
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true?
of
course,
it
is
true
because
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
they
were
aware
of
it.
they
were
only
aware
of
it
to
the
extent
that
he
told
them,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
other
evidence
of
it
except
his
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
had
taken
drugs,
et
cetera.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
are
not
abandoning
it,
but
i
am
wondering
why
you
hadn't
mentioned
it.
if
i
go
out
and
murder
somebody
and
i
go
to
the
police
and
say
i
took
dope
and
i
would
be
turned
loose,
i
might
be
tempted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
miranda
wasn't
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
miranda
wasn't
fifth
amendment,
was
it?
in
this
case,
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
case
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
any
of
the
cases
that
you
rely
on
in
this
court
fifth
amendment
cases,
confessions
held
out
because
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
was
have
you
got
a
united
states
supreme
court
case
that
says
a
state
in
administering
its
criminal
laws
is
obliged
to
follow
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
asking
you
not
what
you
thought.
i
am
asking
you
do
you
have
a
case
that
this
court
said
the
granting
of
a
portion
or
not
excluding
a
confession
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
if
done
by
a
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
what
this
case
said.
this
case
said
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
can't
find
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
any
of
the
opinions
or
the
briefs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
cannot
operate
on
what
you
intended,
i'm
sorry.
