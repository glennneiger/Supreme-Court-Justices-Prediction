justice
byron
r.
white
how
old
was
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
did
this
whole
process
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
with
when
the
duty,
the
statutory
duty
to
tell
him
about
his
right
to
telephone
arose?
there
was
a
duty
that
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
my
question
is
under
the
statute
when
were
the
police
supposed
to
have
told
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
same
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
they
started
to
question
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
after
he
was
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
taken
into
custody?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
only
after
some
questions
that
he
was
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
did
the
duty
to
notify
about
the
telephone
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
after
the
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
court
used
the
wrong
standard
in
arriving
at
a
conclusion
that
there
was
compulsion
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
used
the
wrong
legal
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
they
said
we
must
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
then
decide
whether
his
will
was
overcome
by
all
the
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
even
if
the
confession
was
involuntary,
the
evidence
was
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
fruits
of
the
fifth
amendment
violation
have
to
be
testimentary--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
the
first
time
your
court
has
decided
this,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
still
a
fifth
amendment
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
fortiori
under
commonwealth
v.
white,
a
fortiori
your
point
would
apply,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
be
a
fruit
if
you
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
isn't
a
fruit,
if
physical
evidence
gathered
by
a
search
warrant
using
a
compelled
confession
isn't
a
fruit
of
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
surely
the
same
evidence
gathered
because
of
the
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
wouldn't
be
a
fruit.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happened
to
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
apparently
four
people
disagree
with
you
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
held
admissible
anything
up
until
the
time
he
was
arrested,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
alleging
that
here
there
was
an
arrest
contrary
to
the
finding
of
your
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
defendant
also
lie
as
to
his
encounter
with
quish?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
by
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
high
school
did
he
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
ten
grades
then.
he
wasn't
a
fourth
grader
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
in
the
state
courts
though,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
said
this
was
a
violation
of
miranda?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
reversed
the
holding
that
this
was
an
involuntary
confession,
it
would
be
admissible,
wouldn't
it,
unless
somebody
excluded
it
on
the
miranda
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
confession,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
the
law
of
the
case
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
miranda?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
that
isn't
--
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know.
is
it
still
open,
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
went
beyond
that.
it
said
the
precise
test
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
to
a
state
is
what
it
is
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
the
federal
government.
that
is
what
it
held,
that
is
what
it
said.
