justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant
responded
what?
i
didn't
hear
you.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
victim?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
transcript
from
which
you
have
been
quoting
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
fourteenth,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
qnow,
wait
a
minute.
the
firth
amendment
is
applicable
only
to
the
federal
government
and
you
represent
the
state
of
massachusetts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
couldn't,
and
they
were
obviously
wrong
if
they
said
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
state
of
massachusetts
because
everybody
knows
that
it
does
not.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be
the
fifth
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth.
justice
potter
stewart
the
highest
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
trier
make
any
findings
on
whether
those
statements
were
accurate?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
case
comes
to
trial
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
the
only
evidence
against
the
defendant
will
be
that
of
the
witnesses
who
saw
him
on
the
church
steps
with
the
victim
at
midnight
on
the
night
on
which
she
was
murdered,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sneakers
with
the
blood
stains
on
them.
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
you
know
about
and
is
now
available.
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
would
be
limited
under
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
massachusetts
to
the
two
witnesses
who
saw
the
respondent
and
the
victim
on
the
church
steps.
justice
potter
stewart
one,
all
right,
plus
the
fact
that
he
had
bloody
sneakers
on
at
the
time
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
bloody
sneakers
at
the
time
that
he
was
taken
in
for
questioning.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
it
and
that
is
hardly
a
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
everything
else
having
been
suppressed,
yes,
your
honor.
justice
potter
stewart
in
advance
of
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
interrogation
was
on
the
11th,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
day
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
after?
justice
potter
stewart
the
victim.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
the
same
date?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
think
there
was
evidence
in
any
case
that
there
was
15
valium
or
whatever
it
was,
and
there
was
some
question
of
"is
that
as
much
as
you
usually
take"
or
something
like
that,
or
something
along
those
lines,
indicating
a
period
of
habit
or
use.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mills,
in
your
view
do
you
think
this
case
has
anything
to
do
with
the
doctrine
of
the
miranda
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
talking
about
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
or
don't
you?
i
thought
you
said
no.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
couldn't
have
said
so,
if
i
may
differ
with
my
brother.
it
might
have
been
the
fifth
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
against
state
action.
