mr.
david
a.
mills
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
i'm
sure
that
the
court
assumed
when
it
wrote
that,
your
honor,
that
it
was
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
state
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
a.
mills
before
the
lower
court,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
the
fifth
amendment
insofar
as
it
is
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
because
of
the
court's
initial
discussion,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
involuntariness
and
31
its
cases
relied
upon
in
that
regard,
perhaps
that
is
why
the
court
said
what
it
said.
before
i
begin
the
age
of
the
decedent
in
the
case,
although
not
appearing
precisely
on
this
record,
appeared
in
the
proceedings
as
both
age
23
and
24.
also
with
respect
to
the
dungarees,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
presence
of
blood
on
any
clothing
taken
from
the
home
of
the
defendant.
there
is
similarly
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
defendant,
when
he
was
thumbing
a
ride
on
hyde
park
avenue,
was
on
his
way
to
anything
in
the
nature
of
an
appeal
or
a
contested
proceeding
at
the
unemployment
office.
at
the
outset,
the
defendant
would
like
to
make
clear
that
there
were
not
two
witnesses
who
saw
him
in
the
company
of
the
decedent
on
the
evening
in
question.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
a
six-day
trial
before
a
state
court
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
was
one
witness
who
told
the
police
that
he
saw
the
decedent
and
the
victim
together
at
12
o'clock
in
the
evening,
your
honor.
there
was
another
witness
who
said
he
saw
a
young
man,
and
it
is
not
apparent
and
it
is
not
clear
that
the
two
descriptions
coincided
with
any
precision
at
all.
there
were
two
descriptions
and
the
descriptions
were
different.
the
description
of
the
defendant
on
the
morning
when
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
police,
the
description
that
one
of
the
neighbors
in
the
neighborhood
gave
the
police
when
she
saw
someone
at
2:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
ant
the
description
that
a
witness
was
giving
to
the
police
at
11:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
are
all
substantially
different,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
mr.
mills,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
an
earlier
part
of
your
argument.
at
5a
again
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
which
is
the
supreme
judicial
court's
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
and
i
think
i
am
reading
it
correctly,
it
said
he
was
willing
but
was
going
to
the
unemployment
office
and
did
not
want
to
be
late.
i
don't
know
if
that
makes
any
great
difference,
but
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
unemployment
office.
mr.
david
a.
mills
significant,
your
honor,
that
he
was
going
to
the
unemployment
office.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
was
going
there
for
the
purpose
of
a
contested
appeal
or
anything
that
would
require
his
deliberate
attention.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
be
left
with
the
impression
that
he
was
going
to
a
contested
appeal
as
opposed
to
picking
up
ministerially
an
unemployment
check
or
something
else.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
your
honor,
but
nonetheless
the
condition
of
the
defendant
on
that
day
and
time
he
was
interrogated
is
significant
and
that
would
be
a
circumstance
in
the
totality.
mr.
david
a.
mills
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
from
several
witnesses
is
that
on
the
evening
and
night
of
june
10,
1976,
this
particular
respondent
ingested
some
10
to
15
valium
pills
of
the
5
milligram
variety
and
also
on
the
same
night
ingested
12
containers
of
beer
and
also
partook
of
marihuana
that
was
infected
in
some
way
with
some
other
drug.
in
the
six-day
trial
before
the
state
trial
judge,
a
dr.
greenblat,
who
was
then
the
acting
chief
of
clinical
pharmacology
at
the
massachusetts
general
hospital
and
a
professor
of
medicine
at
the
harvard
medical
school,
was
asked
a
hypothetical
question
precisely
tracking
the
evidence
as
to
the
mount
of
chemical
ingested
by
this
particular
individual
on
the
evening.
the
medical
testimony
and
the
opinion
was
with
respect
to
a
person's
condition
at
11:20
the
following
morning,
that
the
ingester
would
experience
drowsiness,
sedation,
impairment
of
judgment
and
impairment
of
intellectual
function.
that
was
the
evidence
before
the
trial
judge
which
was
apparently
believed
when
matched
with
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
the
amount
of
chemicals
that
were
ingested.
11:20,
of
course,
is
precisely
the
time
which
is
indicated
upon
the
transcript
of
the
interrogation
as
the
time
that
the
interrogation
started.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
by
implication,
your
honor,
the
trier
35
must
necessarily
have
found
the
ingestion
of
drugs
and
must
necessarily
have
believed
at
least
part
of
the
medical
testimony
of
the
expert
because
the
same
language
is
recited
or
substantially
similar
language
is
recited
in
the
memorandum
of
the
trial
judge
in
his
order
on
suppression
of
certain
of
the
evidence.
at
11:20
the
following
morning,
a
boston
police
detective
was
in
the
hyde
park
police
station
in
boston
interviewing
one
witness
who
was
also
a
suspect.
at
that
very
time
that
witness
said,
"and
i
saw
joseph
meehan
in
the
company
of
the
decedent
at
12:00
o'clock
on
the
previous
evening,
and
coincidentally
there
he
is
on
hyde
park
avenue."
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
trial
court
allowed
it
in
part,
your
honor,
and
denied
it
in
part.
there
were
four
parts
of
evidence
before
the
trial
judge
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
sneakers,
a
12:00
o'clock
confession,
dungarees
and
clothing
taken
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant,
and
a
3:00
o'clock
inculpatory
admission.
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor,
the
3:00
o'clock
statement
was
to
his
mother.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion
with
respect
to
the
sneakers
and
the
statement
to
the
mother,
and
allowed
the
suppression
as
to
the
involuntary
12:00
o'clock
confession
and
the
dungarees
that
were
taken
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant.
the
police
officer
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
sneakers
that
were
taken
from
him
in
the
police
station.
mr.
david
a.
mills
under
the
decision
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
i
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
evidence
not
excluded
by
the
lower
court,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
not
two,
your
honor,
just
one.
mr.
david
a.
mills
which
was
not
fresh,
your
honor.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
from
the
record
before
this
court,
that
appears
to
be
the
evidence
at
this
point.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
police
detractive
who
was
taking
part
in
this
interrogation
jumped
out
the
window
after
alerting
two
other
police
officers
to
go
out
the
front
door,
take
a
police
cruiser
and
pursue
the
defendant.
he
was
confronted
on
the
street.
he
was
not
told
he
was
free
to
go,
and
he
was
brought
back
into
the
police
station.
during
his
interrogation,
there
were
at
least
three
other
police
officers
present,
it
appears,
at
all
times
in
the
room.
the
actual
interrogation
was
recorded
on
a
tape
recording
machine
that
was
present
in
the
room.
the
transcript
of
that
taped
proceeding
was
available
to
the
trial
judge,
it
was
available
to
the
lower
court,
the
massachusetts
supreme
court.
it
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
this
court.
the
actual
tape
was
available
to
the
trial
judge
and
it
was
listened
to
by
him
in
open
court.
it
was
apparently
listened
to
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
and
it
is
part
of
the
record
before
this
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
that
interrogation,
the
record
is
silent.
it
discloses
only
that
the
defendant
was
placed
in
a
cell
and
continued
in
detention
until
the
time
that
his
mother
and
brother
arrived.
the
defendant
has
been
fed,
and
i
will
argue
to
this
court,
three
principal
arguments.
first,
that
the
supreme
court
was
correct
in
excluding
the
12:00
inculpatory
admission
as
involuntary
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
second,
that
the
clothing
that
was
taken
from
his
home
was
properly
excluded
because
the
search
warrant
rested
on
an
involuntary
confession;
and,
thirdly,
that
the
3:00
o'clock
inculpatory
admission
supposedly
made
to
the
mother
in
the
presence
of
the
police
officers
should
be
excluded
under
the
criteria
of
brown
v.
illinois
and
darwin
v.
connecticut.
in
determining
the
issue
of
involuntariness,
the
court
explicitly
did
not
rely
upon
one
of
the
alternative
theories
that
had
been
incorporated
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
found
a
miranda
violation
and
also
determined
independently
that
the
confession
was
involuntary.
the
massachusetts
supreme
court,
the
lower
court
in
determining
voluntariness,
looked
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
did
not
adopt
the
miranda
violation.
the
initial
confrontation
with
the
police
i
have
already
mentioned.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
say
that
the
police
were
clearly
anxious
to
apprehend
defendant
meehan.
he
weighed
135
pounds
and
was
confronted
on
the
steer
by
three
mature
police,
officers.
he
was
not
told
that
he
was
free
to
go
and
the
respondent
argues
to
this
court
now
that
if
your
decision
in
dunaway
v.
new
york
had
been
decided
at
the
time
the
case
went
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
suppression,
probably
an
arrest
would
have
been
determined
at
that
time
and
the
sneakers
similarly
excluded.
during
the
course
of
the
interrogation
and
early
interview
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
the
interrogator
early
on
into
the
interrogation
made
misrepresentations
of
fact
to
the
defendant.
in
fact,
i
would
use
the
word
"interrogators"
in
the
plural
because
although
there
was
one
sgt.
kelley
doing
most
of
the
talking,
or
so
it
appears,
there
were
three
other
police
officers
intimately
present
in
this
confrontation
between
a
citizen
and
his
police.
and
so
to
some
extent
the
representations
of
one
were
the
representations
of
four.
and
indeed
at
one
point
in
the
interrogation,
sgt.
kelly
said,
"and
you
could
ask
two
others
who
are
right
here."
the
defendant
was
told
that
he
was
seen
with
the
decedent
by
two
witnesses
on
the
previous
evening.
this
misrepresentation
was
repeated
at
least
seven
times
by
the
interrogator.
this
misrepresentation
was
further
punctuated
by
the
representation
that
the
witnesses
were
positively
sure
of
their
identification
and
that
they
had
known
the
defendant
for
a
long
time.
this
is
inaccurate.
the
lower
court
also
concluded
that
the
interrogator
lied
when
intimating
to
the
defendant
things
about
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
to
the
effect
that
had
the
case
had
already
been
against
him.
the
interrogator
also
misrepresented
to
the
defendant,
"we
are
here
to
help
and
the
truth
is
going
to
be
a
good
defense
in
this
particular
case."
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
is
some
indication
that
there
were
contrary
representations
by
quish,
your
honor.
there
is
no
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
record,
i
don't
believe.
so
initially
the
defendant
suggested
the
cases
of
this
court
have
noted
misrepresentation
of
fact
as
one
of
the
criteria
in
the
totality
of
determining
involuntariness.
secondly,
or
thirdly,
promises
were
made
by
the
police
interrogator
to
the
defendant
while
he
was
in
custody,
during
the
interrogation
in
express
terms,
sgt.
kelley
told
the
defendant
that
a
confession
would
help
the
defendant
in
the
defense
of
the
charge.
it
is
suggested
that
sgt.
kelley
made
personal
assurances
as
well
as
his,
the
police
interrogator's
personal
intervention
with
the
law
in
the
matter
of
this
case
sgt.
kelley
said,
"i
will
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
your
attorney,
the
district
atrorney,
the
local
court
judge
and
right
up
the
line."
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
was
a
promise
of
leniency,
your
honor,
and
a
promise
and
inducement
and
its
truth
or
falsity
in
this
context
as
an
inducement
and
a
promise
and
a
reward
is
immaterial,
truth
or
falsity
we
suggest
is
immaterial.
it
might
also
be
a
misrepresentation
which
would
be
another
factor
in
the
totality.
but
i
suggest
that
that
promise
of
personal
intervention
was
an
inducement
by
the
police
officer
which
has
been
prescribed
by
this
court
in
malloy
v.
fogan
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
not
by
itself,
and
at
no
point
does
the
respondent
argue
that
any
one
individual
factor
in
this
case
is
a
factor
by
itself
which
would
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
psychological
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
but
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
respondent's
brief,
that
particular
promises
speech
which
was
intimately
examined
by
the
trial
judge
and
we
suggest
intimately
examined
as
is
reflected
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court's
opinion
is
interspersed
with
promises
and
rewards
and
all
to
the
alternating
dynamic
of
"we
can't
promise
you
anything
but
we
will
give
you
the
world,
we
can't
promise
you
anything
but
i
will
go
to
the
district
attorney,
i
can't
promise
you
anything
but
it
helps
in
cases
like
this."
this
was
precisely
the
type
of
dynamic
that
was
focused
in
by
the
trial
judge
in
determining
that
the
will
of
this
individual
had
been
overborne
by
the
police
promises.
both
lower
courts
relied
upon
the
evidence
of
intoxication
and
the
impaired
psychological
condition
of
this
respondent
at
the
time
of
his
interrogation.
in
addition
to
the
drugs,
the
uncontradicted
evidence
of
much
drug
ingestion
and
alcohol
ingestion
on
the
evening
of
the
10th,
there
was
also
evidence
of
the
ingestion
of
four
or
five
milligram
valium
capsules
at
10:30
in
the
morning
of
june
11,
1976.
i
would
like
to
not
fail
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
in
addition
to
what
i
have
already
argued
with
respect
to
intoxication,
the
interrogators
were
aware
of
the
drug
ingestion
and
on
three
separate
occasions
during
the
course
of
the
interrogation
the
defendant
brought
that
message
to
the
interrogators,
that
he
had
taken
the
valium,
that
he
was
feeling
jiggy,
and
that
he
was
confused.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct,
your
honor,
apparently
at
11:20
in
the
morning.
mr.
david
a.
mills
that
would
have
been
about
twelve
hours
after
the
wholesale
ingestion
of
the
chemicals
and
it
would
have
been
about
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
--
eight
or
nine
hours
after
a
victim
had
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
--
the
victim
in
this
case
had
been
killed
by
someone.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
both
on
the
11th.
mr.
david
a.
mills
of
which,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
there
was
ample
evidence.
there
were
four
or
five
witnesses
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
your
honor,
there
were
three
or
four
--
i
only
mentioned
initially
one
of
the
witnesses
who
said
12
or
15.
someone
else
may
have
said
15
or
20,
and
indeed
somewhere
in
the
record
there
appears
20
valium
pills
going
into
this
individual
the
night
before.
but
there
were
five
--
four
witnesses,
perhaps
five
witnesses
who
testified
to
the
chemical
ingestion.
both
of
the
courts,
the
trial
court
and
the
lower
court
noted
the
age
of
the
respondent.
at
the
time
he
was
18
years
old.
his
poor
educational
background
and
his
lack
of
worldly
experience
which
have
all
been
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
two
floundering
years
as
indicated
by
his
high
school
record,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
nine
grades,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
to
the
ninth
grade.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
and
he
had
none,
your
honor.
both
courts
found
that
he
had
no
worldly
experience.
he
had
been
only
out
of
his
own
neighborhood
overnight
on
two
or
three
occasions.
mr.
david
a.
mills
perhaps
someone
from
hyde
park,
massachusetts,
your
honor,
a
trip
into
boston
would
be
some
indication
of
more
worldly
experience
than
a
life
pretty
much
confined
to
a
single
rather
sociological
deprived
neighborhood
in
boston,
and
so
both
of
the
lower
courts
looked
at
this
and
considered
it
a
factor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
not
on
this
record,
your
honor,
and
apparently
both
of
the
lower
courts
also
felt
that
way.
mr.
david
a.
mills
none
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
is
testimony
in
the
transcript
as
to
how
he
got
them,
your
honor.
he
got
them
from
two
other
of
his
young
friends
in
an
automobile
the
same
night.
mr.
david
a.
mills
perhaps
a
type
of
street
wise,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
was
testimony
in
the
forum
of
hypothetical
questions
to
a
state
medical
expert
on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
there
was
some
cross-examination
of
the
defendant.
there
was,
the
respondent
tells
you
and
suggests
to
this
court,
nowhere
near
the
evidence
in
the
proceeding
below
as
was
made
the
subject
of
hypothetical
questions
to
the
state's
medical
witness.
there
was
some,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
lower
court
also
paid
significance
as
a
single
factor
in
the
totality
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
not
even
forthwith
the
information
as
to
his
right
under
massachusetts
statute
to
use
the
telephone.
on
all
of
these
factors,
both
massachusetts
courts
concluded
the
involuntariness
and
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
did
that
unanimously.
the
state
has
suggested
in
its
petition
and
in
its
arguments
to
this
court
that
there
should
be
some
further
active
act
of
official
coercion
in
the
nature
of
injection
of
truth
serum
or
the
active
use
of
hypnosis
in
order
to
be
a
prerequisite
to
the
finding
of
involuntariness,
and
the
respondent
suggests
that
such
is
not
consistent
with
the
applicable
opinions
of
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
clothing
that
was
taken
from
the
defendant's
house,
the
respondent
notes
that
there
is
no
case
of
this
court
that,
it
can
cite
which
is
precisely
on
all
fours
with
the
case
that
is
now
before
the
court.
however,
in
a
series
of
cases
which
begins
with
counselman
v.
hitcock
in
1892
and
continues
to
suggest,
and
i
have
included
in
the
brief
the
five
cases,
concluding
with
mandujano
in
1976,
although
each
of
the
cases
deals
in
the
context
of
this
court's
examination
of
an
immunity
statute
and
the
scope
of
an
immunity
statute,
the
language
is
explicit
that
the
fruit
or
derivative
evidence
of
fifth
amendment
violation
shall
be
excluded,
and
it
is
on
this
basis
that
the
respondent
has
argued
the
propriety
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court's
exclusion
of
the
dungarees.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
none
at
all,
your
honor.
the
lower
court
mentioned
miranda.
mr.
david
a.
mills
and
at
one
point
in
the
interrogation
the
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor
--
in
one
point
in
the
interrogation
the
police
officer
said,
"do
you
want
to
tell
us
anything
more,
joe?"
and
the
respondent
answered,
"no."
nevertheless,
the
police
officer
went
on
with
the
interrogation.
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
is
a
factor,
your
honor.
miranda
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion.
any
of
the
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
it
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
my
argument
to
the
state
supreme
court?
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
think
i
mentioned
that
there
was
a
violation
of
miranda
and
that
it
was
something
--
the
attitude
of
the
police
and
whether
or
not
the
police
would
honor
a
respondent's
answer
to
a
question,
are
you
willing
to
talk
to
us
more,
and
the
respondent
says
no,
i
am
not,
and
the
questioning
continues,
i
think
that
that
is
a
factor
of
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
confession,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be
admissible.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
preferred
to
rest,
the
language
of
the
court
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
don't
think
it
decided,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
would
be
open
for
a
matter
of
rehearing
before
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
on
the
miranda
issue.
mr.
david
a.
mills
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
miranda
is
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
well
the
criteria
in
federal
cases
applied
by
this
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
believe
that
when
this
court
made
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
thought
that
that
is
what
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
said,
in
malloy
v.
hogan
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
mills
without
being
perhaps
said
explicitly,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
right.
mr.
david
a.
mills
perhaps
i
intended
to
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
may
i
proceed
to
the
third
argument,
your
honor.
the
third
argument
is
that
the
3:00
o'clock
admission
made
to
the
mother
should
be
excluded
on
the
principle
of
brown
v.
illinois
and
darwin
v.
connecticut.
the
evidence
and
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
third
argument
of
the
respondent
before
you
is
simple.
he
was
taken
to
a
cell
and
detained.
at
some
point
his
mother
and
a
brother
arrived
at
the
police
station
and
they
were
escorted
to
his
cell,
despite
their
requests
to
be
left
alone
with
the
defendant,
they
were
not
allowed
that.
and
i
might
add
nor
was
an
attorney
who
eventually
arrived
at
the
police
station
allowed
to
be
alone
to
confer
with
his
client.
at
that
point
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
believe
that
it
is
a
criteria
that
the
court
may
look
at
it
in
determining
the
attitude
of
the
the
court
may
look
at
in
determining
that
began
on
hyde
park
police
throughout
the
confrontation
avenue,
your
honor,
and
ended
at
the
point
where
his
attorney
left
the
station
late
that
night.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
were
at
least
two
and
perhaps
three
police
officers.
the
evidence
is
somewhat
contradictory
--
not
contradictory,
but
it
was
different.
there
is
at
least
one
feeney,
there
could
be
also
madden
and
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
there
were
three
other
police
officers,
two
of
them
in
plain
clothes.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
a
break
in
he
stream
of
events,
and
with
respect
to
this
3:00
o'clock
afternoon
statement
the
respondents
suggest
that
the
language
of
this
court
in
brown
v.
illinois
is
particularly
appropriate
when
this
court
suggested
that
the
later
inculpatory
admission
that
had
been
made
by
brown
in
that
case,
that
his
initial
inculpatory
admission
vitiated
any
incentive
on
his
part
to
avoid
self-incrimination.
in
meebar,
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
his
involuntary
remarks
made
during
the
interrogation
that
was
tape
recorded,
had
confessed
to
first
degree
murder.
what
more
heinous
matter
under
massachusetts
law
could
vitiate
any
incentive
on
the
part
of
a
person
in
custody
to
avoid
further
self-incrimination.
but
suffice
it
to
say
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
life
in
prison,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
without
parole,
your
honor.
and
using
the
criteria
of
darwin
v.
connecticut
and
brown
v.
illinois,
there
was
no
break
in
circumstances
between
the
time
that
he
was
interrogated
initially,
with
the
confession
found
to
be
involuntary
and
this
later
inculpatory
admission.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
briefed
and
argued
the
case
in
the
state
supreme
court,
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
waived
any
federal
constitutional
arguments.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
do
not
know.
under
our
practice
if
an
assignment
is
not
made
it
cannot
be
briefed.
once
you
come
to
the
point
of
finally
choosing
three
or
four
that
are
significant
or
chosen
to
be
significant,
those
that
are
not
then
briefed
and
argued
have
been
waived
under
massachusetts
practice.
thank
you.
