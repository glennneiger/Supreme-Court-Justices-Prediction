justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question
in
that
connection.
the
officers
not
only
had
the
blood
stains
but
they
also
had,
as
you
just
said,
the
identification
by
two
witnesses
of
the
suspect
in
the
neighborhood
within
a
very
short
time
of
the
crime.
one
of
the
people
who
identified
him
also
identified
the
young
woman
and
said
they
were
together.
now,
didn't
the
search
warrant
allude
to
those
two
identifications?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
police
had
the
evidence
that
the
chief
justice
has
alluded
to,
that
is
the
blood
on
the
shoes
before
the
arrest
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
plus
the
evidence
of
these
two
witnesses,
which
would
have
been
abundant
to
establish
probable
cause
to
search
the
residence,
i
would
have
thought.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
at
the
very
least,
isn't
this
a
plain
error
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
just
seems
to
me
to
be
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
people
just
left
out
evidence
in
their
possession
when
they
drew
up
the
affidavit
for
the
warrant.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
compelled
to
rely
on
the
confession
when
appropriate
facts
were
available
that
would
have
justified
identifying
the
dungarees
and
the
underpants?
