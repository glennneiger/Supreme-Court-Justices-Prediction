justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
a
state
statutory
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
miss
smith,
at
page
21a
of
the
petition
which
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court,
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
justice
kaplan
makes
a
comment,
"finally,
the
confession"
--
and
here
he
is
referring
to
the
second
confession
of
that
afternoon
--
"was
rendered
involuntary
by
police
misconduct
which
cannot
be
termed
inadvertent."
what
is
the
court
referring
to
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
supreme
judicial
court
then
means
that
any
second
confession
is
rendered
involuntary
if
there
has
at
any
stage
in
the
confession
proceeding
been
police
misconduct
which
cannot
be
termed
inadvertent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
would
say
that
if
this
case
would
come
here
from
rhode
island
where
there
was
no
such
statute,
the
factors
to
be
weighed
would
be
different
because
nothing
would
be
held
against
the
rhode
island
police
by
reason
of
their
failure
to
inform
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
going
to
get
to
your
other
point,
i
suppose
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
one
be
sure
that
that
was
a
false
statement?
in
other
words,
if
the
police
had
some
of
the
evidence
that
your
opposition
describes
and
they
ask
for
the
search
warrant
so
that
they
felt
they
had
a
strong
case
without
the
confession,
might
not
the
sergeant's
statement
have
been
perhaps
not
good
advice
but
not
necessarily
false?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
might
not
worldly
experience
have
been
a
substitute
for
high
school
education?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
by
worldly
experience
a
trip
to
florence?
(laughter)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mills,
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you
until
your
time
was
up.
it
is
a
fairly
minor
point.
on
page
4a
again
of
the
petition,
which
is
the
supreme
court
opinion,
there
is
a
footnote
that
says,
"the
defendant
has
not
briefed
or
argued
certain
assignments
of
error
and
they
are
considered
waived."
were
any
of
those
federal
constitutional
arguments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
felt
you
had
waived
some
arguments
by
not
briefing
or
arguing
them
what
i
am
curious
to
know
is
if
you
know
now
whether
they
were
federal
constitutional
arguments.
