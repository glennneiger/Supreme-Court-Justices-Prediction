arguments

in
78-1874,
massachusetts
v.
meehan.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
miss
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
that
the
amplifying
system
is
working
here,
miss
smith.
if
you
will
just
desist
for
a
moment.
are
we
functioning
now?
very
well,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
this
all
comes
from
the
tape
recording
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
miss
smith,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
other
evidence,
the
evidence
of
fresh
blood
on
some
part
of
his
clothing
or
his
shoes,
what
happened
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
that
evidence
ever
introduced
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
has
the
--
i
don't
recall
the
opinion
here
--
does
the
opinion
address
those
fresh
blood
stains
on
the
shoes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
blood
stains
two
different
pieces
of
evidence,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mills.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
relying
there
on
the
fact
that
one
of
them
gave
his
name,
one
witness
gave
a
description
which
fit
him?
do
you
mean
that
only
one
named
him
should
be
counted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
you
are
focusing
on
the
notion
that
it
would
take
a
good
deal
more
perspicacity
to
deal
with
a
contested
hearing
than
to
pick
up
a
check.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
what
you
are
driving
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
trier
of
those
issuers
could
either
believe
or
not
believe
his
statement
about
the
amount
of
drugs
and
liquor
he
had
ingested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
doctor's
opinion
would
of
necessity
be
on
the
assumption
that
those
statements
were
accurate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
qwhat
did
the
trial
court
do
with
reference
to
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
one
to
his
mother?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
people
who
know
their
way
around
to
get
prohibited
drugs
are
called
street
wise.
would
you
say
that
he
was
street
wise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
evidence
that
these
drugs
were
given
by
prescription?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
can
assume
he
got
them
the
way
drug
users
usually
get
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
what
i
thought
was
led
street
wise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
affect
the
case,
any
evidence
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
who
was
present
when
he
said
to
his
mother,
"i
didn't
intend
to
hit
her
so
hard,"
or
who
was
present
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
sentence
on
conviction
for
first
degree
murder
in
massachusetts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
or
without
the
possibility
of
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
mills.
thank
you,
miss
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
78-1874,
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
against
meehan.
and
in
this
case,
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
