justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
going
back
to
the
first
confession
and
to
the
massachusetts
court's
opinion
at
pages
11a
through
--
i
guess
it
is
about
page
17a
or
18a
--they
are
discussing
the
confession
and
its
voluntariness
throughout
that
period
and
they
rely
in
that
portion
of
their
opinion
on
seven
or
eight
different
massachusetts
cases
and
they
stress
the
fact
that
under
massachusetts
law
the
duty
to
tell
the
person
in
custody
has
a
right
to
telephone
his
family
is
relevant,
and
they
end
up
by
concluding
that
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
was
correct.
can
we
be
positive
that
that
conclusion
is
reached
entirely
independently
of
massachusetts
law
and,
secondly,
to
what
extent
should
we
give
any
weight
to
the
violation
of
the
massachusetts
rule
about
telephoning
when
they
relied
on
it
as
they
obviously
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
here
the
court
didn't
hold
that
it
required
exclusion.
they
merely
held,
as
i
understand
them,
that
it
was
a
factor
that
must
be
weighed
in
making
the
voluntariness
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
the
failure
--
that
that
is
a
factor
that
we
should
also
consider?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
had
the
plain
duty
to
tell
him
this
and
they
failed
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
testimony
about
prior
use
of
drugs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
standard
said
so.
