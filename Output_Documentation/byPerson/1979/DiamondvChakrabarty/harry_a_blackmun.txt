justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
i
interrupt
you
on
that.
you
disagree
with
their
statement
that,
first
of
all
there
is
a
difference
between
a
patent
that
includes
a
living
thing
as
a
component
of
the
claimed
invention
and
i
guess
they
agree
that
could
be
patentable,
if
i
understand
them
correctly
but
when
we
confine
ourselves
to
claims
that
cover
only
living
things,
they
say
only
3
out
of
your
68
patents
involve
such
examples.
do
you
take
issue
with
that
statement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
prior
to
the
plant
act
what
would
you
have
said
a
new
plant
was,
a
composition
of
matter;
you
had
discovered
a
new
composition
of
matter?
what
would
it
have
been?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
now
that
--
and
after
the
amendment,
section
4886,
i
suppose
then
there
would
be
some
kind
of
new
plants
that
would
not
be
patentable
under
that
section,
i
mean
that
limited
the
patentability
of
the
plants
to
those
described
in
the
section.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
they
might
have
been
new
compositions
of
matter.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
colleague
suggests
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case
that
absence
the
plant
protection
act
that
you
have
in
effect
abandoned
your
argument
that
any
living
thing
cannot
be
patented.
justice
harry

blackmun
process
involved
only
an
organism.
