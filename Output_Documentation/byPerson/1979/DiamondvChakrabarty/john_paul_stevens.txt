others
don't
think
we
are
talking
about
an
extension
of
the
patent
law,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
you
differ
on
that,
that
is
the
reason
this
lawsuit
is
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
were
looking
for
an
expert
of
patent
laws
would
you
--
would
the
secretary
of
agriculture
come
to
your
mind
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
not
necessarily
an
expert
at
all,
is
he?
his
expertise
lies
elsewhere,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
any.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
there
was
no
explanation
in
the
legislative
history
of
why
this
plant
language
was
added
to
a
predecessor
of
101.
on
page
22
you
refer
to
that
language
of
101
and
you
say
that
the
very
fact
that
congress
originally
added
the
provisions
to
a
predecessor
of
101
strongly
indicates
--
was
there
any
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
question
on
the
1930
legislation.
i
guess
the
government
in
essence
argues
that
if
this
case
had
been
decided
in
your
favor
before
1930,
that
statute
would
have
been
unnecessary.
would
that
be
a
correct
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
and
that
would
still
apply
if
it
were
not
a
hybrid
or
something
like
that.
but
how
does
that
respond
--
it
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
case
in
the
bottom
line
--
but
how
does
that
respond
to
the
suggestion
that
if
you
win
here,
if
you
had
won
this
issue
in
1927
or
'28
there
really
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
for
a
special
plant
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have
then
demonstrated
the
patent
office
had
been
wrong
in
its
narrow
view
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
that
there
is
a
different
standard
of
patentability,
whether
it
be
novelty
or
invention
or
non-obvious
or
whatever
the
term
might
be,
under
the
plant
patent
act
than
there
would
be
for
living
things
like
bacteria?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
plants
any
harder
to
describe
than
bacteria?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
one
looks
--
putting
that
immediate
problem
to
one
side
--
if
one
looks
at
the
basic
reasons
for
patents
and
the
encouraging
of
research
and
development
and
also
encouraging
disclosure
of
those
things
that
have
been
discovered,
what
is
the
essential
difference
between
bacterium
and
some
new
chemicals,
say
a
new
acid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
if
these
are
patentable
then
every
time
they
reproduce
they
infringe
the
patent,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
that
be
technically
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
a
patent
issued
for
the
process
of
putting
one
of
these
--
putting
these
plasmas
in
one
of
the
microorganisms
and
creating
a
new
microorganism,
the
process
of
doing
it?
i
suppose
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
whether
it
was
feasible
or
not
as
a
legal
matter
you
have
indicated
that
that
kind
of
a
process
patent
would
be
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
allowed.
