mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
a
living
organism
is
patentable
subject
matter
under
section
101
of
the
present
patent
law.
this
is
a
relatively
narrow
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
congressional
intent,
a
question
which
does
not,
in
our
view,
require
the
court
to
resolve
any
of
the
much
mooted
current
controversies
about
desirable
public
policies
in
the
field
of
so-called
genetic
engineering.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view,
mr.
justice.
but
the
question
before
the
court
is
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute.
the
claims
at
issue
were
rejected
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
board
of
appeals
but
were
upheld
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
they
are
claims
drafted
in
various
forms
to
a
living
microorganism
to
what
amounts
to
a
laboratory-induced
hybrid
strain
of
bacteria
combining
in
a
single
organism
plasmids
which
are
genetic
units
that
are
plasmids
that
are
found
in
nature
to
exist
only
separately
in
separate
strains
of
these
bacteria.
and
the
combination
of
these
plasmids
in
the
new
strain
enable
that
strain
to
degrade
several
components
of
crude
oil
simultaneously.
the
examiner
allowed
numerous
related
claims
by
the
respondent
to
the
process
for
producing
the
new
strain
and
claims
to
an
inoculum
combining
the
new
strain
with
certain
carrier
material.
some
of
the
rejected
claims
are
also
inoculum
claims
but
in
those
claims
the
only
essential
element
of
the
inoculum
claimed
is
the
new
strain
of
bacteria
itself
without
any
carrier
or
mixture
being
specified
and
those
are
treated
by
everyone
in
the
case
as
essentially
claims
on
the
bacteria,
just
variance
of
the
basic
claim
for
the
bacteria.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
inoculum
--
i-n-o-c-u-l-u-m.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
inoculum,
something
to
be
inoculated;
in
this
case
not
in
a
person
but
on
an
oil
spill
would
be
the
idea
of
the
claim.
now,
perhaps
an
examiner
informed
by
this
court's
analysis
in
parker
v.
flook
would
have
disallowed
some
of
the
claims
that
were
allowed
but
none
of
those
claims
are
at
issue
before
this
court.
there
is
no
mechanism
for
administrative
review
of
claims
allowed
by
an
examiner.
the
board
of
appeals
in
ccpa
did
not
pass
on
the
validity
of
those
claims.
but
the
fact
that
the
process
claims
were
allowed
here
points
up
for
us
what
no
one
really
disputes
here,
that
the
patent
law
does
apply
to
new
technology,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
patent
law
is
to
encourage
the
development
of
new
technology
and
to
grant
rights
to
inventors
who
discover
new
technologies
but
the
claims
involving
those
new
technologies
in
order
to
be
patentable
have
to
be
claims
that
come
within
the
statutory
categories
established
by
congress
as
the
examiner
held
the
process
claims
did
in
this
case,
as
well
as
the
inoculum
claims
combined
bacteria
with
specified
carrier
materials.
and
our
basic
contention
here
is
that
claims
on
living
organisms
themselves
are
not
within
the
statutory
categories
established
by
congress
and
therefore
were
properly
rejected
by
the
examiner
and
the
board
of
appeals
here.
and
that
is
all
that
is
at
issue.
we
start
our
brief
--
the
argument
in
our
brief
with
a
quotation
from
this
court's
recent
decision
in
parker
v.
flook
that
the
judiciary
must
proceed
cautiously
when
asked
to
extend
patent
rights
into
areas
wholly
unforeseen
by
congress.
this
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
mr.
justice,
and
as
i
just
said
we
do
think
the
patent
law
applies
to
claims
involving
new
technology
so
long
as
the
claims
are
within
the
statutory
category.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
reason
i
mentioned
this
sentence
is
because
this
case
really
involves
a
considerable
variant
on
this
sentence.
we
do
not
think
we
are
talking
here
about
an
area
wholly
unforeseen
by
congress.
and
for
that
reason
the
case
is
a
little
bit
different.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
contention
is
that
this
would
be
an
extension
unforeseen
by
congress
but
not
an
area
wholly
unforeseen
by
congress,
because
for
the
last
50
years
congress
has
dealt
quite
specifically
with
hybridization
of
living
organisms
in
patent
statutes.
and
this
is
the
heart
of
our
case,
that
congress
has
for
50
years
built
a
statutory
edifice
on
the
premise
that
the
language
that
is
now
in
section
101
about
patents
on
manufacturers
or
compositions
of
matter
does
not
apply
to
living
organisms
and
they
have
made
specific
provision
for
patenting
of
various
categories
of
organisms
with
a
great
many
exclusions
and
a
great
many
specifically
tailored
provisions,
all
based
on
the
premise
that
those
categories
are
not
included
within
the
general
authorization
for
patents
on
discoveries
of
manufacturers
or
compositions
of
matter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
have
been
patents
issued
on
some
medicines
involving
living
organisms
but
i
don't
know
of
any
patent
on
a
particular
strain
of
yeast.
there
was
a
patent
issued
to
pasteur
for
an
apparatus
and
method
of
purifying
yeast
and
that
included
a
claim
on
the
yeast
so
purified
without
mentioning
any
specific
strain
which
others
would
be
excluded
from
manufacturing
or
using.
whether
that
patent
was
properly
granted
is
something
that
no
court
has
ever
passed
on.
the
question
was
recognized
by
the
court
and
in
to
be
a
question
of
first
impression.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
dealt
with
all
of
those
that
preceded
the
1960's
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
mr.
justice.
but
our
basic
contention
is
that
the
disputes
among
the
parties
about
the
actions
of
particular
examiners
in
uncontested
and
unreviewed
matters
over
a
period
of
many
years,
there
being
some
thousand
examiners
in
the
patent
office
today
dealing
with
some
100,000
applications
a
year
and
there
being
almost
4,200,000
patents
that
have
been
granted
cumulatively
in
the
course
of
the
years,
that
the
disputes
about
what
particular
examiners
have
done
in
accepting
or
rejecting,
allowing
or
disallowing
particular
claims
are
relatively
inconsequential
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
specific
attention
that
congress
has
given
the
issue
here
and
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
an
articulated
policy
of
the
patent
office
to
grant
patents
on
living
organisms
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
no
indication
that
congress
ever
acquiesced
in
any
such
interpretation
of
the
law.
when
this
is
combined
with
the
history
of
the
last
50
years
of
building
a
statutory
edifice
on
the
premise
that
patents
cannot
be
issued
on
living
organisms
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
many
of
them
would
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
what
congress
has
dealt
with
for
the
past
50
years
are
man-made
hybrids
that
do
no
occur
in
nature
and
the
extent
to
which
patentability
should
be
available
on
those
organisms.
and
we
start
in
examining
this
history
of
congressional
treatment
with
the
1930
plant
patent
act
itself
which
amended
what
is
now
section
101
of
the
patent
law
to
read
as
we
have
reproduced
it
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
before
the
1952
recodification
of
the
patent
code
for
22
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
1930
law
which
is
now
section
101
read
as
is
set
forth
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
saying
any
person
who
has
invented
or
discovered
any
new
and
useful
art,
machine,
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter
or
any
new
and
useful
improvements
or
who
has
invented
or
discovered
and
asexually
reproduced
any
distinct
and
new
variety
of
plant
other
than
a
tuber-propagated
plant
may
obtain
a
patent
therefor.
it
is
obvious
to
us
on
the
fact
of
that
that
congress
was
not
operating
on
the
premise
that
any
distinct
new
variety
of
plant
was
a
category
already
included
within
any
new
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter,
otherwise
the
exclusion
of
tuber-propagated
plant
from
the
latter
category
would
have
ambiguities
to
it
and
could
have
been
interpreted
as
a
contraction
of
patent
rights
when
congress
treated
the
act
as
an
expansion
of
patent
rights.
and
this
is
not
left
merely
to
the
face
of
the
statute
but
in
both
house
and
senate
committee
reports
appended
in
full
a
letter
from
secretary
hyde,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
stating
--
we
have
set
forth
this
letter
on
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief
--
stating
very
specifically
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
bring
reproduction
of
newly
bred
our
found
plants
under
the
patent
laws
which
at
the
present
time
are
understood
to
cover
only
inventions
or
discoveries
in
the
field
of
inanimate
nature.
now,
various
efforts
are
made
to
explain
why
this
may
not
be
a
completely
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
then
existing
patent
laws
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
both
houses
appended
this
as
appendix
a
to
their
committee
report.
those
reports
have
only
one
other
appendix,
appendix
b,
the
text
of
the
new
statute.
this
is
not
a
letter
that
is
buried
in
a
whole
list
of
communications
that
are
appended.
there
is
nothing
said
in
either
report
to
cast
any
doubt
on
secretary
hyde's
interpretation
of
the
then
existing
patent
law.
indeed,
the
reports
are
entirely
consistent
with
that
interpretation
and
in
particular
both
reports
have
an
identical
series
of
paragraphs
which
begin
with
the
sentence
"furthermore,
there
is
no
apparent
difference,
for
instance,
between
the
part
played
by
the
plant
originator
in
the
development
of
new
plants
and
the
part
played
by
the
chemist
in
the
development
of
new
composition
of
matter
which
are
patentable
under
existing
law."
and
then
there
is
for
several
paragraphs
a
comparison
of
the
chemist's
development
of
compositions
of
matter
and
the
breeder's
development
of
plants
and
the
terminology
is
always
used
distinctively.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
no
court
holding,
that
is
correct.
but
congress
expressed
no
disagreement
with
that
understanding
and
the
whole
point
of
our
argument
is
not
that
it
was
settled
law
or
that
congress
ever
articulated
specifically
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
a
patent
on
a
living
organism
but
that
congress
developed
very
carefully
wrought
statutes
on
the
premise
that
these
were
the
only
ways
that
one
was
authorized
to
get
a
patent
on
a
living
organism
and
on
the
premise
that
what
is
now
section
101
did
not
authorize
such
patents.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
he
is
not
the
foremost
expert.
he
was
the
cabinet
official
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
was
informed.
the
record
shows
--
that
we
have
produced
in
our
brief
by
patent
counsel
--
he
was
involved
in
the
sponsorship
of
this
legislation
because
of
the
interest
of
plant
breeders
and
hybridizers,
all
of
whom
approached
him
on
the
basis
of
advice
from
patent
counsel.
in
any
event
this
is
the
premise
on
which
the
committee
acted.
no
one
in
congress
on
the
floor
or
in
the
report
questioned
this
premise.
and
everything
that
was
written
and
said
is
consistent
with
this
premise.
the
next
development
was
the
1940
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
decision
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
re
arzbergex,
which
interpreted
the
plant
patent
provisions
of
this
paragraph
as
not
covering
a
claim
on
bacteria.
there
was
an
effort
to
get
a
plant
patent
at
that
time
on
a
microorganism.
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
no
claim
was
made
that
it
fell
within
the
language
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
paragraph.
they
were
all
in
the
same
paragraph
at
that
time.
perhaps
no
claim
could
have
been
made
because
of
the
difficulty
of
meeting
the
description
requirement
for
anything
other
than
a
plant
patent.
but
what
is
interesting
from
our
standpoint
is
that
no
one
on
the
board
of
appeals
or
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
mentioned
in
passing
or
in
any
way
that
perhaps
such
an
organism
could
qualify
as
a
manufacturer
composition
of
matter.
the
question
was
not
reserved,
the
possibility
didn't
even
occur
to
anyone
in
the
course
of
that
litigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
1940.
this
was
10
years
after
the
plant
patent
act
was
passed.
the
next
then
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
premise
of
that
decision
was
that
the
claimant
had
devised
in
a
laboratory
a
new
strain
of
bacteria,
the
same
claim
being
made
by
chakrabarty.
the
claim
was
not
rejected
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
for
obviousness
or
for
lack
of
novelty.
it
was
rejected
to
because
they
interpreted
the
plant
patent
act
as
not
applying
to
a
claim
for
a
bacterium.
the
question
was
whether
a
bacterium
was
a
plant
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
and
they
said
that
was
not
what
congress
had
in
mind,
all
excepting
the
premise
that
it
was
novel,
useful
and
not
obvious.
there
may
be
some
question
about
that
but
that
was
the
premise
of
the
decision.
then
the
next
event
chronologically
was
the
1952
recodification
of
the
patent
laws
in
which
no
question
was
raised
in
congress
or
by
the
drafters
about
the
validity
of
any
of
the
premises
on
which
the
plant
patent
act
was
enacted
or
had
been
interpreted
and
these
provisions
were
separated
out
at
that
time.
the
next
event
chronologically
in
this
history
of
50
years
of
congressional
consideration
of
hybridization,
and
that
is
all
we
are
involved
with
here,
that
the
techniques
in
this
laboratory
are
more
sophisticated
than
the
techniques
of
luther,
burbank
and
the
other
plant
breeders
but
what
is
produced
is
a
hybrid
living
organism,
basically
the
same
kind
of
product.
the
next
event
chronologically
are
the
proposals
leading
to
the
plant
variety
protection
act
of
1970
and
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
the
first
paragraph
of
footnote
12
we
mention
the
series
of
proposals
by
the
patent
bar.
some
of
them
don't
specify
whether
they
thought
existing
law
could
not
extend
this
far.
others
do
specify
quite
specifically,
as
this
1966
resolution
of
the
american
bar
association
patent
section
did,
it
was
entitled
"extension
of
patent
system
to
biological
arts
not
now.
covered"
and
it
favored
coverage
specifically
for
microorganisms
and
animal
husbandry.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
following
up
these
many
proposals
--
we
have
recounted
a
number
of
them
there
--
we
note
on
page
29
of
our
brief
in
footnote
35
that
in
the
course
of
consideration
of
the
plant
variety
protection
act
a
representative
of
this
patent
section
of
the
american
bar
association
referred
to
this
series
of
resolutions
and
to
bills
that
had
been
proposed
at
the
behest
and
with
the
support
of
the
aba
by
senator
mcclellan
with
respect
to
patent
protection
for
microorganisms.
there
had
been
bills
introduced
by
him
but
no
hearings
held
on
them.
and
when
the
plant
variety
protection
act
was
enacted
it
contained
a
specific
exclusion
for
bacteria
as
well
as
for
fungi
and
for
first
generation
hybrids
against
this
background
of
advocacy
of
inclusion
of
bacteria
because
of
their
lack
of
present
coverage
by
the
patent
laws.
and
the
reports
that
were
issued
at
that
time
by
the
congress
in
1970
by
both
committees,
the
important
paragraph
is
set
out
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
and
those
reports
are
much
more
specific
in
agreeing
with
the
position
that
secretary
hyde
had
taken
in
1930
that
no
protection
is
available
under
the
then
existing
laws
to
varieties
of
plants
which
reproduce
sexually,
that
is
generally
by
seed.
this
was
an
extension
of
a
patent-type
protection
that
went
beyond
the
1930
act
which
was
limited
to
asexual
reproduction
which
would
have
to
be
by
cuttings
or
grafting
and
for
the
first
time
went
into
the
field
where
there
might
be
biological
reproduction
uncontrolled
by
the
patentee
or
his
licensees.
and
the
limitations
that
were
specified
on
the
kind
of
patent
protection
to
be
given
were
much
more
extensive
than
the
limitations
under
the
1930
act
which
dealt
only
with
asexual
reproduction.
and
there
were
a
number
of
exclusions.
okra,
celery,
peppers,
tomatoes,
carrots
and
cucumbers
were
specifically
excluded
by
one
provision.
the
authorizing
provision
itself
excludes
fungi
bacteria
and
first
generation
hybrids.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
no
indication
in
the
1930
legislative
history
of
why
the
language
was
being
added
to
section
4886
of
the
revised
statute
rather
than
enacted
separately.
but
the
--
the
only
explanation
that
occurs
is
the
explanation
that
can
be
deduced
from
the
committee
reports
which
are
appended
to
secretary
hyde's
letter
that
this
was
adding
subject
matter
that
didn't
exist
in
4886,
adding
to
the
categories
of
claims
that
could
now
be
patented.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
enough
for
us
to
win
our
case
under
this
court's
decisions,
because
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
and
certain
signal
the
court
has
said
twice
recently
that
the
patent
law
should
not
be
extended.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
may
have
been
uncertainty
but
there
is
no
indication
that
anyone
in
congress
thought
that
patents
could
be
secured
other
than
under
the
plant
patent
act
and
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
there
are
many
indications
that
persons
in
congress
thought
they
could
not
be.
such
guidance
as
we
get
from
the
legislative
history
ia
all
in
one
direction.
it
is
not
air
tight
but
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary
in
the
legislative
history.
everything
indicates
that
to
the
extent
it
was
considered
everyone
in
congress
was
operating
on
the
premise
that
patent
protection
for
living
organisms
was
not
otherwise
available.
and
they
have
built
an
edifice
of
specifically
tailored
statutory
provisions
over
a
period
of
50
years
on
that
premise.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
respondent's
bacteria
were
not
produced
from
inanimate
materials.
they
are
hybrids
of
living
microorganisms
used
in
the
laboratory
which
are
similar
to
mutations
that
develop
without
hybridization
in
microorganisms
just
as
hybrid
plants
are
similar
to
mutations
that
develop
in
plants
without
hybridization.
mutations
are
very
commonplace
among
microorganisms
and
these
particular
organisms
were
produced
by
a
process
of
laboratory-induced
natural
conjugation
where
the
plasmids
moved
between
living
microorganisms.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
that
is
what
it
has
in
common
with
the
products
of
the
plant
breeders.
what
is
significant,
as
we
see
this
case,
when
one
looks
at
the
plant
variety
protection
act
where
we
first
have
congress
dealing
with
organisms
that
can
be
biologically
reproduced
on
their
own
we
have
a
number
of
protective
provisions.
farmers
can
save
their
seed
and
replant
it
and
sell
it
to
other
farmers
for
replanting.
there
is
a
protective
provision
to
use
the
seed
for
research
purposes.
there
is
a
provision
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
can
impose
compulsory
licensing
if
he
thinks
the
public
interest
warrants
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
haven't
abandoned
it
at
all.
before
1930
we
know
of
no
instance
of
a
grant
of
a
patent
on
a
novel
organism
itself.
there
were
grants
on
combinations
but
not
when
the
novelty
claimed
in
the
combination
was
novelty
in
the
living
organism
and
only
in
a
living
organism.
process
patents
have
been
granted
and
process
involving
microorganisms
since
before
it
was
known
what
microorganisms
were
canning,
brewing,
etc.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
use
of
an
organism
in
combination
with
other
materials
and
the
process
would
specify
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
significance
of
the
difference
is
that
if
you
exclude
others
from
being
able
to
produce
a
living
organism
or
to
offspring
of
the
organism
because
someone
is
granted
a
monopoly
on
the
organism
itself,
it
is
an
unprecedented
extension
of
patent
monopoly
to
the
biological
offspring
of
living
organisms.
and
congress
has
very
carefully
controlled
this
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act
where
without
equivocation
the
committee
report
said
that
the
existing
patent
law
did
not
cover
living
organism
and
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
were
upheld
in
this
case
and
a
large
number
of
patents
were
required
to
be
issued
before
congress
could
devise
a
proper
system
to
deal
with
the
new
technology
here,
then
rights
and
equities
would
be
built
up
which
would
implicate
fifth
amendment
taking
problems
which
would
require
congress
to
consider
grandfathering,
to
consider
treating
similarly
situated
people
differently
and
so
forth,
where
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
ever
provided
for
this
kind
of
monopolization.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
essential
difference
is
the
bacterium
like
other
things
engages
in
genetic
cellular
reproduction
which
in
the
case
of
a
microorganism
means
reproducing
the
entire
organism.
and
the
claims
itself
show
that
these
grow
in
profusion.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
original
ones
probably
don't
exist
very
long
after
they
begin
to
divide
and
grow.
and
what
you
really
have
are
not
what
were
produced
in
the
laboratory
but
the
generational
offspring
of
those.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
isn't
a
fear.
it
may
not
be
true
of
this
particular
microorganism,
that
it
would
spread.
but
we
are
talking
about
a
category
of
patentable
subject
matter
and
when
congress
first
dealt
with
the
possibility
of
biological
organisms
that
could
reproduce
themselves
they
did
it
in
a
way
that
provided
for
many
safeguard.
perhaps
they
would
want
more
safeguards
in
light
of
newer
developments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
difficulties
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
fitting
into
the
conception
of
the
present
patent
law.
that
is
correct.
or
people
who
in
some
way
facilitate
their
reproduction
would
be
manufacturing
them
within
traditional
concepts
of
the
patent
law.
they
don't
fit
very
well
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
we
made
in
our
reply
brief.
but
the
incentive
that
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
about
is
certainly,
in
our
view,
there
in
the
process
claims
that
were
allowed
the
examiner
right
here.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
someone
else
might
not
be
able
to
find
another
process
for
reproducing
a
similar
living
organism
and
be
excluded
by
the
grant
for
this
process.
we
do
think
the
patent
law
does
allow
for
claims
within
the
statutory
categories
on
this
technology
but
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
particular
process
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
allowed
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
there
were
numerous
process
claims
that
were
allowed
in
this
case.
and
they
were
on
the
process
of
inducing
in
the
laboratory
this
hybrid
organism.
the
claims
that
were
rejected
were
only
the
claims
that
attempted
to
get
the
patent
on
the
organism
itself.
