we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
diamond,
commissioner
of
patents
v.
chakrabarty.
mr.
wallace,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
from
your
response
that
the
patents
listed
on
page
50
of
your
friend's
brief
running
from
1873
to
1930
you
think
are
not
relevant
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
secretary
hyde's
letter,
mr.
wallace,
what
significance
do
you
place
on
what
would
appear
to
be
very
carefully
chosen
words
that
at
the
present
time
are
understood
to
cover
--
"are
understood"
--
if
there
were
holdings
that
were
perfectly
clear
he
wouldn't
have
used
that
language,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
date,
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
pretty
clear
that
the
developments
in
the
40
years
since
then
have
been
of
such
magnitude
that
they
would
not
have
even
been
in
the
imagination
of
people
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
equally
arguable
that
this
recital
that
you
have
been
going
over
shows
a
state
of
uncertainty
about
the
coverage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
talking
about
the
statute
now.
i
am
talking
about
this
statutory
--
this
legislative
history.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
merely
shows
there
was
uncertainty
at
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mckie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
reference
on
page
50,
the
list
of
cases
from
1873
to
1930
is
directed
at
that
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
we
had
brand
breeders
--
human
beings
--
wasn't
this
evolutionary
process
taking
place
in
nature
and
when
the
human
beings
got
into
the
act
they
accelerated
it
and
refined
it.
but
it
was
a
natural
process,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
why
--
that
is
the
basis
of
the
rule
that
products
of
nature
were
not
dependable.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
left,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
difference;
what
is
the
significance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
