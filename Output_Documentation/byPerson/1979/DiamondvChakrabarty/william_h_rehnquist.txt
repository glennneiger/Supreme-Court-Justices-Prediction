mr.
wallace,
do
you
think
that
when
congress
passed
the
patent
statute
in
the
1790's
it
foresaw
telephone,
radio,
television
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
it
was
to
reward
inventors
who
saw
things
that
congress
didn't
see
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
patent
laws
were
passed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

penicillin
and
yeast
patented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
discover
a
composition
of
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
fear
incubation
of
the
spores
or
something
of
that
nature?
