mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
brother
has
said,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
particular
microorganism
is
patentable.
this
microorganism
is
useful
in
degrading,
degenerating,
eating
up,
if
you
will,
oil
spills,
one
of
our
real
modern
problems
with
respect
to
the
ecology.
a
more
useful
art
would
be
hard
to
imagine.
the
constitution
provides
for
the
congress
obtaining
power
to
grant
patents
in
order
to
advance
the
useful
arts.
i
think
it
is
conceded
here
that
the
constitutional
power
is
there.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
congress
has
exercised
that
power.
in
our
submission
it
has
and
it
has
in
two
different
categories
of
statutory
language.
it
has
provided
for
the
granting
of
patents
on
new
manufacturers.
it
also
has
provided
for
the
granting
of
patents
on
compositions
of
matter.
in
our
submission
this
bacterium
developed
by
dr.
chakrabarty
is
either
one
of
those,
perhaps
it
is
both.
the
board
of
appeals
in
this
case
made
an
express
finding
that
this
was
not
a
product
of
nature.
they
also
said
that
it
was
not
expressly
excluded
by
the
statutory
language.
in
our
submission
that
means
that
it
was
made
by
dr.
chakrabarty,
it
represents
something
made
by
man
and
therefore
not
a
product
of
nature
and
therefore
a
manufacture
which
can
be
patented
under
the
existing
patent
law.
now,
in
this
case
the
government's
primary
argument
in
the
petition
itself
and
in
the
initial
brief
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
that
depends,
mr.
justice
white,
on
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
if
you
mean
that
it
existed
previously
in
nature,
i
think
you
could
not
for
the
reason
that
it
would
have
been
a
product
of
nature.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
it
is
not
expressly
mentioned.
it
is
a
court
adjudicated
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
well,
it
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
the
closest,
discover
a
composition
of
matter.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
that
may
well
be
the
case.
the
problem
i
think
is
whether
it
is
an
invention,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
was
addressed
by
the
congress
in
1930.
but
that
is
a
different
problem
than
we
are
concerned
with
here.
we
are
concerned
with
here
something
that
was
not
merely
extracted
from
nature
and
sought
to
be
patented
but
rather
something
that
was
then
acted
upon
by
man
to
change
an
essential
characteristic
and
to
enable
it
therefore
to
degrade
a
number
of
components
of
oil
simultaneously,
which
is
something
that
the
prior
existing
microorganisms
could
not
do.
it
has
been
provided
with
an
additional
characteristic
and
i
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
in
american
plant
v.
brogdex
it
qualifies
as
a
manufacture
for
that
reason.
we
have
here
a
finding
of
fact,
in
effect,
by
the
patent
office
administrative
agency
which
is
charged
with
making
such
findings,
namely
the
board
of
appeals,
that
this
was
not
a
product
of
nature
and
it
therefore
is
a
manufacture
and
it
is
patentable
in
our
submission
as
such.
now,
the
prime
position
taken
by
the
government
previously
in
this
case
has
been
that
the
policy
of
the
patent
office
has
always
been
to
refuse
to
grant
patents
on
living
subject
matter
and
that
this
represents
a
change
of
that
policy,
therefore
an
extension
of
the
patent
law
into
an
area
never
previously
foreseen
by
the
congress.
now,
we
answered
that
argument
by
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
adduced
that
showed
that
particular
conclusion
at
all.
there
was
no
support
for
the
contention
the
government
made.
moreover,
we
brought
forward
several
different
kinds
of
evidence
which
do
show
that
the
policy
of
the
patent
office
in
the
past
has
been
to
grant
patents
on
living
subject
matter
in
appropriate
circumstances.
now,
the
government
appears
to
want
now
to
step
aside
from
that
whole
issue
and
they
now
say
that
their
primary
thrust
is
on
a
different
issue
entirely,
namely
the
history
of
the
plant
patent
act
and
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
and
our
submission
the
reason
they
want
to
do
that
is
we
have
shown
that
their
initial
premise
in
seeking
certiorari
in
this
case
is
erroneous.
the
policy
of
the
patent
office
has
not
been
shown
to
have
been
contrary
to
granting
patents
on
living
subject
matter.
we
have
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
items
of
evidence
that
we
have
adduced,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
only
one,
however.
we
have
pointed
also
to
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
funk
v.
kalo,
a
1947
case,
i
believe,
in
which
a
patent
had
been
issued
by
this
same
patent
office
on
bacteria.
and
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with
here.
that
patent
was
to
a
mixture
of
bacteria,
the
same
kind
of
thing
for
which
claims
are
sought
here
and
the
patent
office
in
that
case
had
granted
the
patent
on
the
bacteria.
it
was
found
to
be
invalid
in
this
court
for
a
different
reason
but
not
because
it
was
directed
to
living
subject
matter.
we
referred
to
that
case
in
our
brief,
the
government
responded
by
saying
well,
that
really
was
dealing
with
a
different
matter.
but
the
point
is
that
it
was
claiming
bacteria
and
it
was
claiming
bacteria
alone.
so
that
there
is
an
instance
of
the
patent
office
not
only
having
granted
the
patent
but
now
seeking
to
say
that
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
are
faced
with
here.
in
our
submission
it
is
the
same
situation
we
are
faced
with
here
but
for
one
point
that
makes
no
difference.
the
point
is
that
in
that
case
the
bacteria
were
a
mixture
of
different
species,
each
of
which
was
old.
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
single
species
which
is
new.
but
they
are
both
living
things.
if
a
patent
cannot
be
granted
on
one
because
it
is
alive,
then
a
patent
cannot
be
granted
on
the
other
because
it
is
alive.
but
the
government
appears
now
to
take
the
position
that
the
patented
bacterium
in
the
funk
v.
kalo
case
was
even
though
it
was
alive.
i
don't
know
whether
you
noticed
the
emphasis
that
was
placed
on
a
word
in
the
argument
by
my
friend
here
a
little
earlier
and
that
was
"alone"
or
"themselves."
the
government
appears
now
to
have
switched
its
position.
they
are
now
saying
that
in
the
case
of
claims
to
bacteria,
micro-organisms
alone,
or
themselves,
then
the
policy
has
always
been
never
to
grant
such
patents,
not
the
policy
has
been
to
refuse
patents
on
living
things.
it
is
a
totally
different
thing.
now,
we
adduced
proof
of
a
number
of
different
patents.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
just
referred
to
that
at
page
50,
i
think,
of
our
brief.
there
are
some
68
patents
in
that
list.
the
government
says
as
to
most
of
those
patents
they
are
directed
to
old
subject
matter,
as
if
that
made
it
different.
the
subject
matter
is
alive
whether
it
is
old
or
not.
as
to
some
14
patents,
and
their
brief
and
footnote
2
is
associated
with
this,
in
their
brief
they
say
as
to
those
14
patents
they
are
directed
to
new
subject
matter
but
additional
material
beyond
the
living
subject
matter
is
claimed,
as
if
that
changed
it.
the
subject
matter
is
alive
whether
it
has
something
combined
with
it
or
not.
my
point
really
is
that
the
living
nature
of
the
thing
is
not
what
has
prevented
it
from
being
patented
in
the
past.
the
patent
office
attitude
has
been
to
grant
patents
on
living
things
if
they
met
the
other
criteria
such
as
not
being
products
of
nature.
now,
when
somebody
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
yes,
i
would
but
only
to
a
limited
degree.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
most
of
those
patents
do
claim
something
in
addition
to
the
living
thing.
at
least
the
patent
in
funk
v.
kalo
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
--
claimed
only
living
things
and
the
three
additional
patents
that
they
refer
to.
there
may
be
some
others
but
i
don't
think
the
point
is
really
worth
exploring
as
to
how
many
others.
but
my
point
is
that
the
thing
does
not
become
dead,
unliving
because
it
is
combined
together
with
something
else.
really
i
think
the
way
this
arose
in
the
course
of
history
in
the
patent
office
is
as
follows
somebody
came
around
with
a
new-found
kind
of
bacteria.
they
found
that
it
was
useful
in
doing
something.
they
went
to
the
patent
office
with
a
request
to
patent
this
and
the
patent
office
said,
"well,
no,
you
just
took
something
that
was
found
in
nature,
it
is
a
product
of
nature."
then,
the
applicant
being
rather
inventive
anyway,
said,
"well,
now,
i
will
claim
that
together
with
something
in
which
it
is
not
found
in
nature.
for
instance
i
will
claim
it
with
an
insecticidal
carrier
and
now
i
have
an
insecticidal
composition
and
you
ought
to
grant
me
that
patent."
and
the
examiner
says,
"i
must
agree
with
you
because
it
is
not
found
together
with
the
carrier."
we
have
an
illustration
of
that
in
this
very
case,
because
several
of
the
claims
in
this
case,
the
allowed
claims,
cover
the
combination
of
a
bacterium
with
a
carrier,
namely
straw.
that
bacteria
is
not
found
in
straw
in
nature.
therefore
it
is
not
a
product
of
nature
but
it
is
still
alive.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
government
has
justified
the
distinction
between
the
two.
and
the
reason
i
emphasize
this
is
to
point
out
that
the
policy
of
the
government
until
very
recently
here
has
been
uniform
and
that
is
to
not
deny
patents
on
living
things
but
rather
to
deny
patents
on
products
of
nature,
whether
they
are
living
or
not.
now,
in
this
case
we
have
pointed
out
in
addition
to
the
number
of
patents
that
we
have
identified
and
also
the
cases
that
we
have
referred
to
we
pointed
out
the
patent
office
has
established
official
classifications
of
patents
on
living
things,
the
reason
being
of
course
that
they
have
a
sufficient
number
of
patents
that
they
want
a
place
to
put
them.
they
have
responded
to
our
showing
in
respect
of
one
sub
class
only.
that
sub
class
is
embarrassing
to
them
i
think
because
it
calls
for
patents
on
microorganisms
alone,
or
themselves
or
per
se.
and
that
is
where
they
are
now
reduced
to
in
their
position.
they
say
microorganisms
alone
are
not
patentable.
but
we
have
pointed
out
that
they
have
a
sub
class
on
microorganisms
alone.
their
answer
to
that
is
that
the
international
authorities
wanted
a
sub
class
to
be
set
up
for
that
kind
of
thing,
presumably
because
in
a
national
patent
law
this
kind
of
thing
is
permitted.
then
they
also
say,
"well,
we
have
so
many
patents
on
living
things
that
have
been
granted
that
we
have
to
find
a
place
to
put
them."
now,
we
have
also
pointed
as
another
form
of
evidence
to
the
board
decision
in
one
case,
the
farr
case
that
is
identified
in
our
brief,
the
reason
for
doing
this
is
that
they
said
in
their
brief
after
our
response
to
their
petition
for
certiorari
pointed
out
that
this
kind
of
thing
existed,
they
said,
"well,
the
board
of
appeals
and
the
commissioner
have
always
had
the
policy
that
patents
would
not
be
granted
on
living
things."
but
we
pointed
to
a
board
of
appeals
decision
in
which
a
patent
was
granted
by
that
board
reversing
an
examiner
and
that
patent
was
directed
to
a
living
thing.
we
have
also
pointed
to
commissioner
watson's
statement
to
a
congressional
committee.
commissioner
was
a
commissioner
of
patents
in
the
"fifties
under
the
eisenhower
years
and
during
his
submission
to
the
congress
he
said
patents
are
granted
on
cultures.
well,
cultures
are
nothing
but
groups
of
microorganisms.
they
now
seek
to
interpret
that
away
by
saying
that
he
must
have
been
referring
to
a
process
of
doing
something.
but
he
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
process
of
doing
something,
he
refers
to
cultures.
and
cultures
were
what
was
claimed
in
the
patent
involved
in
funk
v.
kalo,
this
court's
decision.
so
i
think
that
the
evidence
rather
indicates
that
patents
have
been
granted
over
many,
many
years
on
living
things
if,
as
i
say,
they
met
the
statutory
criteria
in
other
ways.
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
parker
v.
flook
in
which
somebody
seeks
to
extend
the
patent
protection
to
a
wholly
different
area.
this
is
rather
one
in
which
patent
protection
has
been
granted
over
the
years
and
now
the
administrative
agency
seeks
to
change
that
position.
in
our
submission
that
is
their
job,
to
go
to
congress
and
get
permission
for
such
a
change.
i
would
like
to
refer
for
a
few
moments
to
the
statutory
history
of
the
plant
patent
act,
because
the
government
apparently
is
now
placing
its
primary
reliance
upon
that
point.
in
1930
we
were
at
a
situation,
rightly
or
wrongly,
in
which
patents
were
not
being
granted
on
plants.
plant
breeders
were
desirous
of
obtaining
patent
protection
for
their
work.
they
went
to
the
congress
and
asked
for
congressional
authority
for
the
patent
office
to
grant
patents
on
plants.
they
obtained
such
authority
by
way
of
the
plant
patent
act
of
1930.
now,
whether
or
not
the
patent
office
should
have
denied
patents
on
plants
prior
to
to
1930
is
really
not
significant
here
but
that
appears
to
be
what
the
government
is
really
saying.
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
the
plant
breeder
was
doing
very
much
the
same
kind
of
thing
as
dr.
chakrabarty.
well,
i
think
they
were
doing
something
rather
different,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
worth
belaboring
the
point.
the
point,
however,
is
that
plants
were
not
being
patented
prior
to
1930
and
the
congress
provided
for
the
granting
of
patents
on
plants.
there
is
not
one
word
in
that
entire
statutory
history
that
indicates
that
the
congress
thought
that
patents
could
not
be
granted
on
living
subject
matter.
it
is
just
not
there;
it
is
not
there
expressly
and
it
is
not
there
compliedly.
much
is
made
out
of
secretary
of
agriculture
hyde's
letter
but
that
letter
was
relied
on
only
for
two
things,
which
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
statement
which
is
quoted
by
the
government.
that
letter
is
relied
upon
by
the
congressional
committees
for
the
expertise
that
the
agriculture
department
has
in
identifying
varieties
of
plants
and
they
are
suggesting
that
the
patent
office
may
want
to
come
to
them
for
assistance
in
distinguishing
between
the
various
varieties
of
plants.
there
is
another
point,
which
slips
my
mind
at
the
moment,
which
is
expressly
mentioned
in
the
statutory
history
in
the
committee
reports.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
for
this
additional
reason.
the
patent
office
attitude,
as
i
say,
has
been
to
refuse
to
grant
patents
on
plants.
from
everything
we
can
determine,
that
refusal
was
based
on
the
product
of
nature
contention.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
think
not,
and
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
problem
that
the
plant
breeders
were
having
apparently,
and
i
can
judge
only
by
what
happened
rather
than
the
rationale
of
it,
because
i
don't
find
the
decision
on
the
point,
but
the
problem
apparently
was
that
they
didn't
think
that
a
sufficient
change
was
being
made
by
man.
what
they
thought
apparently
--
the
patent
office,
rightly
or
wrongly
thought
that
the
work
of
the
chemist
that
was
referred
to
in
argument
earlier
was
quite
different
from
the
work
of
the
plant
breeder.
the
plant
breeder
was
doing
nothing
but
taking
the
seed
from
one
and
pollen
from
another
and
mixing
them
together
and
nature
was
doing
the
work.
now,
i
say
"apparently,"
because
i
can't
justify
the
rationale.
i
do
know
that
the
commissioner
of
patents
had
said
expressly
in
a
very
early
opinion
that
plants
were
not
patentable.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
the
plant
patent
act
calls
for
a
different
variety,
which
is
a
different
kind
of
problem
than
unobviousness,
i
think.
not
being
from
that
particular
field,
i
don't
have
sufficient
experience
in
their
problems
to
justify
it,
but
the
statutory
requirement
is
different
than
it
is
in
respect
of
regular
patents.
so
that
a
bacterium,
i
think,
has
to
comply
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
regular
patent
law,
which
are
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness,
as
well
as
descriptiveness.
now,
that
is
another
problem
that
the
plant
breeders
had
before
1930
and
that
was
that
the
requirements
of
the
patent
law
then,
and
still
today
except
for
plants,
required
that
you
describe
the
invention
sufficiently
that
it
could
be
reproduced.
and
you
can't
describe
a
plant
sufficiently
that
it
can
be
reproduced.
so
what
happened
in
1930
was
that
the
congress
put
in
a
special
exception
for
plant
patents
and
said,
"you
don't
have
to
comply
with
that."
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
in
the
bacterial
area
the
descriptiveness
problem
has
existed
but
it
has
been
solved
by
a
deposit
system.
what
happens
in
the
bacterial
area
--
we
are
dealing,
after
all,
with
microscopic,
submicroscopic,
perhaps,
sizes
of
material
--
you
can
put
in
a
recognized
depository,
and
we
have
at
least
two
major
ones
in
this
country,
a
sample,
a
freeze-dried
sample
of
the
microorganism.
and
when
you
do
that
someone
can
go
that
agency
and
extract
a
sample
and
reproduce
the
invention
by
the
use
of
that
sample.
so
with
that
deposit
system
it
is
possible
to
describe.
but
mere
words
would
not
be
enough.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
would
think
that
but
for
the
prior
decisions
which
indicated
that
it
was
a
product
of
nature,
i
would
have
claimed
it
as
either
a
composition
of
matter
or
a
manufacture.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
would
think
that
is
a
probable
interpretation
of
the
section.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
would
not
have
been,
for
the
reason
that
they
would
have
been
products
of
nature.
but
that
is
a
different
matter.
my
point
is
that
the
--
probably
the
rationale
for
the
patent
office
refusing
to
grant
patents
on
plants
earlier
than
that
was
that
they
were
a
product
of
nature
and
man
had
too
little
to
do
with
the
generation
and
the
development
of
the
plant
to
make
it
a
manufacture
rather
than
a
composition
of
matter.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
f.
mckie,
jr.
it
may
well
be
the
case.
i
have
never
seen
that
elucidated
but
it
sounds
like
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mutations
have
been
going
on
for,
some
people
think,
in
the
order
of
billions
of
years.
and
some
people
think
that
all
of
living
things
are
based
on
mutations
from
one
original
parent.
but
it
is
the
fact
mutations
of
plants
and
of
human
beings
have
been
going
on
naturally
for
many,
many
years.
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
point
about
this
deposit
system,
if
i
may,
a
point
that
was
brought
up
by
one
of
the
brief's
amicus
and
which
i
forgot
to
make
in
my
own
brief.
there
is
a
merit
to
this
deposit
system
that
is
very
important
with
respect
to
the
granting
of
patents.
if
patents
are
foreclosed
in
this
particular
area,
then
there
will
be
incentive
to
keep
the
microorganism
secret,
trade
secret
law
would
then
protect
the
microorganism.
and
one
would
not
deposit
the
microorganism
with
one
of
these
deposit
systems.
with
patent
protection
possible
it
is
required
by
the
patent
law
that
there
be
such
a
deposit
and
therefore
that
the
microorganism
be
available
to
future
researchers.
but
if
that
availability
of
patents
is
removed
and
therefore
the
requirement
to
deposit
is
also
removed,
then
it
will
not
be
possible
to
build
research
upon
research,
which
is
the
way
most
research
occurs.
and
there
may
well
be
a
problem
with
respect
to
a
failure
in
point
of
time
of
research.
thank
you
very
much.
