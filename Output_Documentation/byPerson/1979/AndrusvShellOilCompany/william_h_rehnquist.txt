justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
freeman
v.
summers
treat
it
differently
than
you
do.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
that
the
interior
department
has
changed
its
position
over
the
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
has
the
same
latitude
as
we
have
held
the
nlrb
has
to
change
its
position,
or
do
you
think
it
is
bound
to
simply
interpret
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
so
doing
it
did
change
its
own
interpretation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
wallace,
before
you
get
to
that
point.
you
say
that
the
decision
in
freeman
v.
summers
is
contrary
to
justice
vander's
opinion
in
cameron
v.
united
states,
and
you
quoted
the
language
of
justice
vander
in
cameron
saying
that
justifying
the
expenditure
of
his
time
and
means
in
an
effort
to
develop
a
paying
mine,
and
in
freeman
v.
summers
it
says
it
doesn't
have
to
be
immediately
disposed
of
at
a
profit.
doesn't
"develop
a
paying
mine"
mean
that
there
may
be
some
period
where
you
are
not
going
to
make
a
profit
which
will
be
ultimately
be
amortized
by
the
sale
of
something
that
does
become
valuable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
assume
that
wasn't
the
court's
interpretation
in
freeman
v.
summers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
president
filmore
was
president
in
'52.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
filmore
was
president
in
'52.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
you
said
'52.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
buchanan
was
president
i
thought
from
1850
--
no,
1857.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
ninth
circuit
was
reversed
in
hibi,
which
the
government
cites
in
its
brief,
because
this
court
said
the
government
could
not
be
estopped?
you
cite
it
in
your
brief
at
page
76.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
would
have
to
show
the
reliance
element.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
true
if
you
had
never
petitioned
for
certiorari,
too.
