but
this
is
a
different
issue.
justice
william

brennan,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
just
so
i
am
sure
i
follow
it
as
you
get
into
the
statutory
argument,
the
ultimate
question,
is
it
not,
is
whether
or
not
these
were
"valuable
mineral
deposits"
within
the
meaning
of
section
1
of
the
1872
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
would
be
patents
if
any
that
issued
between
1954
and
1960?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
freeman
v.
summers.
the
briefs
indicate
that
in
the
case
there
were
draft
opinions
back
and
forth
and
the
issue
was
actually
fought
out
before
the
opinion
was
released,
apparently
some
subordinates
in
the
department
thought
the
decision
should
have
gone
the
other
way.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
decision
in
christman
v.
miller
was
called
to
anyone's
attention
and
considered
before
the
decision
was
made?
