justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
cause
you
to
lose
the
thread
of
your
argument.
i
really
didn't
understand
the
point
you
were
making
about
the
1920
act.
i
would
like
to
be
sure
i
--
you
said
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
make
available
mineral
lands
which
had
previously
been
classified
and
withdrawn?

paul
stevens
except
oil
shale.
now,
how
does
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
they
also
save
claims
for
other
minerals
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
