that
is
of
course
the
big
issue,
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
were
talking
about
with
my
brother
white
was
this,
that
your
opponent,
despite
all
the
findings
to
the
contrary,
argues
that
under
the
traditional
normal
criteria
of
valuable
discovery,
these
discovery
meet
those
criteria.
justice

so
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice

stewart
and
if
that
is
true,
if
he
is
correct,
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
you
don't
get
into
anything
else,
do
you?
justice

stewart
right.
justice

mr.
hamilton,
before
you
sit
down,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what
is
the
difference
between
question
two
and
question
three
which
you
listed
among
three
additional
questions
on
page
three
of
your
brief.
but
perhaps
your
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquist
now
has
answered
that.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
wouldn't
make
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
difference
that
you
have
just
explained
in
your
answer
to
mr.
rehnquist.
