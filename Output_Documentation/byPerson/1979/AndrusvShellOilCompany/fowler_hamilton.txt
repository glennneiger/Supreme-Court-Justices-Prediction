mr.
fowler
hamilton
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
a
few
preliminary
observations
by
way
of
background,
my
discussion
will
present
the
law
and
the
facts
insofar
as
they
relate
to
six
points
that
in
our
view
are
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
the
case.
the
first
will
have
to
do
with
the
problem
that
congress
and
executive
branch
faced
in
when
in
1916
they
discovered
in
consequence
of
work
of
the
geological
survey
beginning
in
1901
and
extending
down
to
1916
that
thereby
lay
in
the
green
river
formation,
which
is
located
predominantly
in
northwestern
colorado
but
extends
into
wyoming
and
utah,
the
largest,
richest
reserve
of
energy
in
the
world,
and
it
still
is
the
largest,
richest
reserve
of
energy
in
the
world,
holding
according
to
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
aggregate
in
oil
of
a
richness,
in
shale
of
a
richness
of
30
gallons
per
ton
and
a
thickness
of
15
feet,
a
grand
total
of
580
to
600
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
having
in
its
reserves
capable
of
now
being
produced
with
mining
and
recording
and
refining
methods
now
available
an
immediately
available
reserve,
economics
to
one
side,
of
80
billion
barrels
of
oil,
which
is
three
times
the
total
reserves
of
the
united
states
approximately,
and
larger
than
the
total
amount
of
oil
that
has
been
consumed
in
the
united
states
since
oil
was
discovered
in
1859
in
titusville,
pennsylvania.
the
second
preliminary
matter
i
should
like
to
bring
to
your
attention
is
that
there
is
no
disputed
fact
in
this
case
which
is
not
unusual
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
the
hearings
lasted
over
five
months
in
colorado,
from
june
of
1967
until
october
of
1967,
produced
a
transcript
of
5,000
pages
and
more
than
700
exhibits,
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
is
one
of
the
most
extensive
hearings
ever
held
under
the
mining
laws.
further,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
six
claims
involved
in
these
proceedings,
each
of
160
acres,
or
a
total
of
960
acres
minus
a
small
fraction
of
a
claim
that
was
found
not
to
contain
shale,
are
physical
indistinguishable
from
the
349
acres
of
oil
shale
claims
that
were
patented
during
the
forty
years
from
1920
until
1961.
it
is
also
conceded,
i
believe,
that
there
is
no
other
known
firmity
in
these
claims
if
oil
shale
is
a
patentable
mineral.
indeed,
inspectors
of
the
department
approved
all
of
the
claims
in
this
claim
for
patenting
in
1958
and
1960
and
all
of
the
formalities
have
been
done,
a
certificate
had
issued,
had
been
sent
to
washington
for
the
pure
ministerial
act
of
issuing
the
patent
when
the
order
came
down
not
to
issue
any
more
oil
shale
patents.
now,
before
turning,
i
might
here
just
list
the
six
points
that
i
shall
address
the
court
on.
one,
is
the
nature
of
the
problem
that
faced
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
when
they
discovered
this;
secondly,
what
they
did
with
the
problem,
how
they
solved
it;
thirdly,
the
application
of
the
solution
over
a
period
of
41
years;
fourth,
the
four
principles
that
the
attempt
of
the
department
of
the
interior
to
abolish
that
solution;
fifth,
the
four
independent
alternative
reasons
we
advance
that
prohibit
the
department
from
abolishing
that
solution;
and,
sixth,
the
immense
benefits
to
the
public
that
have
resulted
from
the
application
of
that
solution.
but
before
doing
that,
i
should
like
to
respond
to
a
point
made
by
my
opponent
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
stevens.
there
is
in
a
footnote
in
the
case
to
which
your
honor
referred
the
statement
that
there
are
500,000
acres
that
are
cluttered
up
by
oil
shale
claims.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
that
statement.
the
record
shows
in
the
transcript
at
page
3417
and
3744
that
in
fact
in
colorado
the
government
did
a
very
thorough
study
of
all
of
the
counties.
these
claims
have
to
be
filed
in
counties
or
they
lapse
within
thirty
days
of
discovery.
they
made
a
very
thorough
survey
of
all
of
the
counties
in
which
the
preponderant
part
of
the
oil
shale
was
located,
the
piceance
basin,
and
their
testimony
was
at
that
time
--
of
course
that
was
in
1920
--
that
at
that
time
approximately
3.5
percent
of
those
reserves
had
been
patented,
approximately
4.5
percent
were
claimed
subject
to
whatever
infirmities
the
claims
might
have,
so
that
there
was
somewhere
between
92
and
97
percent
of
this
priceless
reserve
that
is
owned
today
by
the
government
without
any
claims
on
it.
now,
i
come
to
my
first
point
and
that
is
the
problem
that
faced
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
when
they
learned
that
they
had
this
immense
treasure
on
their
hands
back
in
1916.
it
is
necessary
to
touch
briefly
by
way
of
background
upon
the
general
land
law.
the
problem
the
united
states
faced
in
connection
with
the
public
land
was
not
how
to
keep
it,
the
problem
was
how
to
get
rid
of
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
surely.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
he
did
say
five
million.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
roughly.
that's
right.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
the
source
that
i
was
quoting
was
not
a
neutral
source,
it
was
the
government
source.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
1967,
the
date
of
the
hearing.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
the
transcript,
3714
to
3744,
testimony
of
one
of
their
experts
named
duncan
based
upon
an
extraordinary
exhaustive
study
that
had
been
made
by
the
department
of
the
claims
in
all
of
the
counties
in
which
the
claims
that
had
been
filed.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
transcript
3714-3744.
it
is
also
the
source
of
my
statement,
it
is
the
most
valuable
mineral
reserve
in
the
world.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
much
larger.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
much
larger
than
iran
or
saudi
arabia.
it
is
unbelievably
large.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
true.
now,
i
said
that
the
problem
that
faced
the
government
in
respect
to
the
land
laws
was
not
how
to
keep
the
land
but
not
how
to
get
rid
of
it
and
that
facts
that
show
that
are
quite
clear
and
simple.
when
the
thirteen
colonies
got
their
freedom
from
britain,
britain
agreed
in
the
treaty
of
paris
to
give
the
colonies
all
of
the
land
that
lay
between
the
western
borders
of
the
thirteen
colonies
and
the
mississippi
river.
maryland
would
not
approve
of
the
constitution
because
it
didn't
have
any
western
that
boundaries
abutted
on
this
land
unless
the
new
states
agreed
to
cede
it
to
the
federal
government
which
they
did,
and
that
doubled
the
land
that
the
thirteen
states
had
from
about
230
million
acres
up
to
another
230
million
acres.
then
when
president
jefferson
purchased
the
louisiana
purchase,
that
again
doubled
the
area
of
the
united
states
and
three-fourths
of
that
was
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government.
and
then
as
we
moved
west
--
the
manifest
destiny,
the
mexican
cession,
et
cetera
--
we
finally
exhausted
the
2.5
billion
acres
of
land
that
constitute
the
united
states
and
about
2.1
billion
acres
the
federal
government
has
had
on
its
hands,
1.8
billion,
and
it
has
been
very
difficult
to
get
rid
of
it.
it
still
holds
roughly
650
to
700
million
acres.
first
they
tried
to
sell
it
because
secretary
hamilton
and
secretary
gallatin
thought
it
was
a
wonderful
way
to
pay
the
debt,
so
they
started
pricing
it
at
$10
an
acre.
the
only
thing
wrong
with
that
was
that
there
were
a
lot
of
people
in
pennsylvania,
virginia,
new
york
and
other
large
states
who
had
bought
a
lot
of
land
from
their
states
for
about
three,
four
or
five
cents
an
acre
and
they
undercut
the
government
price,
so
they
couldn't
do
it.
they
tried
selling
it
on
credit
and
nobody
paid.
they
all
went
bankrupt
because
they
didn't
have
working
capital.
so
finally
they
had
to
go
to
a
policy
of
free
land,
which
they
did.
they
tried
it
first
in
the
homestead
act
of
1952,
which
curiously
enough
president
buchanan
vetoed,
but
it
was
finally
confirmed
in
the
homestead
act
of
1862,
with
160
acres
you
had
yourself
a
farm
and
pay
$2.50
an
acre
for
it
if
you
lived
on
it
for
five
years.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
did
i
say
'62?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
said
1852.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
will
defer
to
your
greater
knowledge,
but
i
think
it
was
vetoed.
now,
there
was
no
mining
law
in
effect
during
this
point.
when
they
had
the
gold
rush,
they
were
all
trespassers.
people
made
fortunes
trespassing
on
the
public
domain.
the
first
mining
law
came
in
in
1866
and
it
provided
in
general
terms
that
the
land
should
be
given
away.
it
applied
only
to
vein
or
lode
mines,
where
the
miner
discovered
a
vein
and
then
was
permitted
to
follow
it
as
far
as
it
went
in
the
earth.
in
1870
it
was
provided
that
you
could
mine
placer
claims,
placer
claims
being,
as
you
know,
detritus
or
eroded
land
that
has
gone
down
in
a
stream
and
then
you
pan
it
and
get
something
out
of
it.
both
of
these
--
in
1872
the
law
was
codified,
that
is
the
mining
law
was,
and
it
is
very
interesting
because
we
have
to
engage
in
a
way
in
an
act
of
historical
imagination
to
get
ourselves
back
to
where
we
were
in
1872
because
that
is
still
the
law
today
and
that
is
the
law
under
which
a
lot
of
hard
rock
miners
even
as
we
are
sitting
here
are
going
out
with
their
burros
and
hammers
and
clamoring
all
over
the
public
land,
including
the
land
that
is
reserved
for
parks
in
most
cases,
trying
to
find
hard
rock
minerals,
gold,
silver,
lead,
et
cetera,
which
haven't
been
held
under
this
leasing
act.
that
is
the
law.
the
historical
imagination
parts
come
in
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
this
was
just
--
this
law
was
passed
in
1972,
just
four
years
before
the
sioux
indians,
under
sitting
bull,
had
their
fight
with
col.
custer
at
the
battle
of
the
little
big
horn.
that
incidentally
was
occasioned
by
the
circumstances
that
--
one
of
the
factors
was
a
mine
strike
up
in
the
black
hills
and
everybody
was
rushing
up
there
and
the
whites
very
callously
and
senselessly
slaughtered
the
buffalo
and
deprived
the
indians
of
their
food.
so
that
is
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
has
four
very
interesting
parts.
here
it
is
-
except
as
otherwise
provided,
all
valuable
mineral
--"valuable"
wasn't
in
the
'66
act,
oddly
enough
--
all
valuable
mineral
deposits
in
land
belonging
to
the
united
states,
both
surveyed
and
non-surveyed,
shall
be
free
and
open
to
exploration
and
purchase,
and
the
lands
in
which
they
are
found
to
occupation
and
purchase,
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
those
who
have
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
such,
under
regulations
prescribed
by
law,
and
according
to
the
local
customs
or
rules
of
miners
in
the
several
mining
districts,
so
far
as
the
same
are
applicable
--
in
other
words,
congress
adopted
the
standards
of
miners,
whatever
they
were.
there
was
no
federal
government
for
any
practical
purposes
out
in
this
part
of
the
world,
so
that
in
order
to
maintain
peace
they
simply
said
we
will
take
over
the
customs
of
the
miners.
now,
there
are
four
aspects
of
that
statute
which
i
think
are
relevant
for
our
discussion
today.
first,
it
says
"valuable,"
for
it
says
they
shall
be
free,
given
way.
next
it
says
that
that
shall
be
done
under
regulations
prescribed
by
law
and
according
to
the
local
customs
of
miners.
now,
the
department
of
the
interior
had
occasion
to
consider
that
when
secretary
hoke
smith,
twice
governor
of
georgia
and
several
times
a
senator
was
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
he
wrote
the
famous
castle
v.
womble
case
about
which
you
have
heard
so
much.
i
should
like
to
read
the
passage
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
and
then
i
should
like
to
read
the
next
passage
that
is
not
quoted
in
the
government's
brief.
the
passage
quoted
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes,
it
is
in
the
government's
brief,
page
19.
the
part
i
quote,
which
is
set
forth
says
"where
minerals
have
been
found
and
the
evidence
is
of
such
a
character
that
a
person
of
ordinary
prudence
would
be
justified
in
the
further
expenditure
of
his
labor
and
means,
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success,
in
developing
a
valuable
mine,
the
requirements
of
the
statute
have
been
met."
but
then
it
goes
on,
and
this
is
not
quoted
"for
if
as
soon
as
minerals
are
shown
to
exist
and
at
any
time
during
exploration
before
the
returns
become
remunerative,
the
lands
are
to
be
subject
to
other
disposition,
few
would
be
found
willing
to
risk
time
and
capital
in
the
attempt
to
bring
to
light
and
make
available
the
mineral
wealth
which
lies
concealed
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
as
congress
obviously
must
have
intended
the
explorer
should
have
had
proper
opportunity
to
do."
in
other
words,
they
said
go
in,
if
it
looks
promising,
have
a
claim
and
then
we
will
give
you
time
to
go
on
and
see
if
there
is
anything
there
that
is
really
valuable.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
now,
it
was
against
that
background
that
congress
and
the
executive
branch
found
themselves
facing
a
very
serious
problem
when
this
great
valuable
deposit
of
oil
shale
was
discovered
because
it
was
not
hard
rock
mineral
and
all
of
the
minerals
before
that
had
been
hard
rock
minerals,
gold,
silver,
what
have
you,
except
for
oil
which
had
been
made
the
subject
of
a
special
act
in
1897.
furthermore,
the
problem
with
this
mineral
wasn't
to
discover
it,
everybody
knew
it
was
there,
the
problem
was
in
order
to
make
it
profitable
to
find
a
way
to
improve
the
existing
devices
so
that
you
could
market
at
a
profit
in
competition
with
other
forms
of
energy,
notably
oil.
so
congress
addressed
itself
to
that
problem
and
tried
to
see
how
it
could
fit
this
non-metallic
energy
source
into
a
law
devised
to
take
care
of
hard
rock
minerals
running
in
veins
and
found
in
placers,
and
the
conclusion
that
they
came
up
with
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
placer.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
placer,
i'm
sorry.
thank
you.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir,
it
would
be
analogous,
yes,
sir.
the
way
the
congress
and
the
way
the
executive
branch
solved
the
problem,
they
solved
in
1916
when
they
made
the
first
classification
that
related
to
oil
shale.
in
1897,
congress
had
given
the
department
of
the
interior
the
power
to
make
classifications
of
lands
as
mineral
or
non-mineral
because
the
mineral
lands
took
precedence
over
the
agricultural
lands
because
it
was
felt
that
it
was
more
desirable
to
have
the
minerals
developed
in
view
of
the
small
amount
of
the
minerals
than
it
was
to
have
additional
farms.
so
in
that
classification,
what
happened
was
that
when
the
director
of
the
geological
survey
had
to
come
to
grips
with
this
problem
of
whether
or
not
stuff
was
a
valuable
mineral,
he
found
that
it
was
and
he
wrote
a
memorandum
describing
the
basis
for
his
reasoning
and
he
wrote
it
to
the
commissioner
of
the
land
office
and
here
is
what
he
said.
he
said,
"the
net
result
of
oil"
--
this
was
1916
--
"the
net
result
of
oil
shale
investigations
already
made
is
that
the
oil-shale
areas
in
colorado,
utah,
and
wyoming
constitute
a
latent
petroleum
reserve
whose
possible
yield
is
several
times
the
estimated
total
remaining
supply
of
petroleum
in
the
united
states."
as
i
mentioned,
that
is
still
the
case
today.
"in
view
of
the
high
prospective
mineral
value
of
lands
underlain
by
oil-shale
deposits
it
is,
of
course,
apparent
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
be
acquired
under
the
nonmineral
land
laws.
the
lands
have
not
been
recommended
for
withdrawal"
--
in
those
days,
as
now,
the
geodetic
survey,
when
they
classified
lands
as
minerals,
they
could
have
withdrawn
them
from
further
location,
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
minerals
when
they
were
made
available
under
the
mineral
leasing
act,
including
oil
shale,
but
it
was
decided
here
--
and
this
was
an
exception
ordinary
practice
--
that
they
would
find
that
they
were
mineral
in
character
and
valuable
for
mineral,
but
that
they
would
not
withdraw
them,
and
the
reasons
why
he
asserts
that
the
department
decided
not
to
withdraw
them
was
because
the
oil-shale
industry
is
not
yet
developed
in
the
united
states,
and
as
it
is
desired
to
give
opportunity
for
the
establishment
of
experimental
plants,
it
is
believed
the
lands
should
remain
open
for
the
present
to
acquisition
under
the
mineral-land
laws,
even
though
they
are
ambiguous
and
but
poorly
adapted
to
deposits
of
this
type
--
referring
to
the
hard
rock
deposits.
"accordingly,
i
hereby
classify
the
tracts
listed
below
as
mineral
lands,
valuable
as
a
source
of
petroleum
and
nitrogen,
and
request
that
you
make
the
proper
notation
of
the
classification
upon
your
records."
now,
that
brings
me
to
my
third
point,
which
is
the
use
that
the
government
and
congress
have
made
of
that
solution
to
classify
them
as
minerals
and
leave
them
open.
the
first
use,
of
course,
was
when
they
found
the
solution
and
stated
it
in
the
language
which
i
have
just
read.
next,
between
1916
and
1920,
the
record
is
full
of
it,
they
notified
senators,
congressmen,
people
in
the
west,
newspapers,
that
this
language
is
valuable,
go
after
it,
the
price
of
oil
is
going
up
from
about
$1.20
in
1916
and
reaching
a
high
of
$3.48
in
1920.
the
war
was
over,
people
were
concerned
about
it
coming
out
and
thousands
of
people
went
out
and
staked
claims.
it
is
all
in
the
record.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
patent
on
these
lands
had
to
be
faced
by
the
department
in
1920,
in
the
same
year
that
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
passed.
now,
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
making
available
the
substances
that
it
covered,
petroleum,
et
cetera,
which
had
been
withdrawn
as
the
department
had
classified
these
lands
as
mineral.
so
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
make
available
lands
that
were
not
available
at
all
theretofore
except
for
oil
shale.
it
had
been
available
because,
you
recall,
it
was
not
withdrawn.
these
were
withdrawn.
the
act
was
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
how
much
time
do
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
anyway,
it
is
in
the
brief.
i
can
summarize
it
this
way.
the
mineral
leasing
act
came
into
public
notice
in
1916.
there
was
four
years
of
activity
about
it.
the
oil
shale
people
went
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
said,
look
here,
if
you
put
our
oil
shale
into
this,
which
you
plan
to
do,
for
gosh
sakes,
leave
us
some
claims,
be
sure
that
we've
got
the
claims.
there
were
no
claims
for
these
other
minerals
so
the
exception
didn't
have
to
apply
to
them,
so
they
had
had
a
big
meeting
at
the
department
of
the
interior,
the
department
of
the
interior
said
fine,
they
went
down
to
congress
and
said
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
claimants
agree
on
the
statute,
they
went
to
congress,
congress
approved
it
and
that
was
that.
then
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
or
not
an
oil
shale
should
be
patented.
it
was
patented
the
same
year.
it
was
very
carefully
considered.
the
lawyers
in
the
department
of
the
interior
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
to
patent
it.
the
instructions
were
issued
following
castle
v.
womble.
then
there
were
four
other
incidents
in
which
the
department
and
congress
had
to
consider
this
matter,
each
of
which
they
confirmed
castle
v.
wombler
as
a
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
except
oil
shale.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
what
happened
was
the
act
provided
that
none
of
these
minerals
should
be
available
for
patent
but
should
only
be
available
under
lease,
and
it
included
oil
shale.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
oil
shale
people
said
that
is
going
to
kill
our
claims
if
it
goes
in
like
that
because
we've
got
these
claims
and
we
haven't
got
patents.
so
they
came
down
to
washington
and
went
to
interior
with
their
congressmen
and
senators
and
interior
said,
yes,
that's
right,
therefore
we
will
put
in
a
clause
to
save
the
oil
shale
claims
located
before
1920.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
because
had
they
not
done
that,
they
would
have
been
wiped
out.
so
the
purpose
of
the
saving
clause
was
to
save
the
oil
shale
claims.
you
didn't
have
that
problem
with
the
other
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
as
a
practical
matter,
there
weren't
any
of
those
because
those
minerals
had
all
been
withdrawn
for
years
because
as
soon
as
they
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
--
had
been
classified,
they
were
withdrawn
and
you
couldn't
stake
a
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
so
they
filed
the
instructions
following
the
original
decision
based
on
the
last
paragraph
of
castle
v.
womble.
now
i
had
better
turn
promptly
to
my
fourth
point.
i
should
mention
that
in
1960-61,
for
reasons
that
nobody
knows
because
there
was
no
hearing,
nothing,
word
went
out
from
washington
to
the
department
of
the
interior,
don't
issue
any
more
claims
on
oil
shale.
there
were
18
claims
pending,
of
which
those
here
are
two
and
there
are
16
others
in
another
case
that
has
been
going
on
for
the
same
16
years.
the
16
claims,
they
held
them
invalid
because
they
hadn't
done
assessment
work.
in
these
two
claims,
there
have
been
assessment
work,
the
claims
were
otherwise
perfect
so
they
produced
this
argument
that
oil
shale
was
not
then
and
had
never
been
valuable.
now,
the
reasons
we
say
that
the
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
that
are
four.
in
the
first
place
--
and
i
have
tried
to
outline
very
sketchily
the
facts
that
are
supplemented
in
our
brief
--
we
say
that
the
congress
has
not
just
acquiesced
or
reacted
something
like
the
internal
revenue
code
and
overlooked
some
order
where
there
is
some
fine
print,
that
the
congress
was
actively
engaged
indeed
in
the
oil
shale
and
the
leasing
act
expressly
provided
that
oil
shale
would
be
--
it
is
a
valuable
mineral
and
subject
to
patent
because
i
submit
that
one
cannot
read
that
act
make
any
sense
out
of
it
unless
one
agrees
that
oil
shale
is
a
valuable
mineral.
the
congress
by
its
other
action
at
various
times
as
late
as
1955,
they
passed
a
multiple
leasing
act
which
was
introduced
by
mr.
aspinall
who
was
a
congressman
for
that
part
of
the
world,
and
the
reason
for
it
as
the
legislative
history
shows
was
that
the
interior
department
had
adopted
the
principle
that
they
would
not
patent
minerals
where
there
was
a
surface
patent
outstanding,
for
example,
on
a
homestead
patent
where
the
minerals
had
been
reserved
as
they
were
in
the
case
of
oil
shale
prior
to
1920,
unless
the
oil
shale
mineral
claimant
could
get
a
deed
from
the
surface
owner
and
the
surface
owner,
then
the
department
would
grant
the
patent
because
it
gave
you
the
fee
and
if
you
had
a
farmer
that
was
going
to
hold
you
up
you
had
great
difficulty
getting
him
to
agree
to
convey
to
you
so
he
could
reconvey.
so
they
passed
this
statute
to
deal
expressly
with
oil
shale,
called
the
multiple
leasing
act,
so
interior
could
now
go
ahead
and
grant
a
patent
on
the
mineral
even
though
a
homesteader
owns
the
surface,
because
ordinarily
a
patent
on
a
mineral
patent
takes
the
surface
with
it.
but
if
the
surface
has
been
pre-patented
it
couldn't
do
that.
now,
i
will
turn
to
the
four
points.
the
first
is
that
congress
has
actually
endorsed
this
rule
that
oil
shale
is
a
valuable
mineral
and
so
patented.
the
second
is
that
apart
from
that,
the
department
of
the
interior
in
an
independent
ground
has
promulgated
this
rule,
has
had
it
in
effect
since
1920
at
the
very
least
in
the
instructions,
that
under
those
circumstances
it
cannot
now
in
fairness
reverse
it
retroactively,
and
in
that
connection
i
should,
if
i
may,
point
to
the
court's
attention
that
neither
one
of
those
two
bases
for
your
decision
will
have
the
slightest
prospective
effect.
they
can
only
affect
oil
shale.
they
can
only
affect
oil
shale
claims
that
were
located
before
1920.
they
can
only
affect
oil
shale
claims
that
are
proven
to
be
valid
to
meet
all
the
other
tests
besides
discovery.
so
therefore
it
is
not
as
though
you
were
being
asked
to
keep
an
agency
from
changing
a
rule
prospectively
that
is
going
to
affect
the
administration
of
some
important
branch
of
the
government,
where
you
are
going
to
bind
it
to
the
past.
here
all
you
are
being
asked
to
do
is
to
make
it
stay
with
the
past,
as
it
were,
what
it
did
for
41
years.
so
this
has
no
consequential
effect,
precedential
effect
that
will
in
any
way
impair
interior's
administration
of
the
mining
laws
on
the
public
domain.
and
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
the
total
amount
of
claims
that
are
available
are
only
about
equal
to
what
they
have
already
patented
out
of
a
total
of
16,000
acres
in
this
great
formation,
so
that
it
will
have
no
consequential
economic
effect
that
will
be
adverse.
thirdly,
i
come
to
the
point
--
which
i
take
it
that
already
our
position
is
clear
--
that
indeed
this
was
a
valuable
mineral,
that
it
was
decided
the
only
rational
way
they
could
have
decided
it
was
to
say
oil
shale
was
a
valuable
mineral,
and
perhaps,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
soundness
of
that
position
is
illustrated
by
the
circumstance
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
oil
shale
is
not
a
valuable
mineral,
it
will
nullify
200,000
acres
of
reservations
of
oil
shale
that
underlie
homesteads
where
the
interior
department
has
granted
the
homestead
and
reserved
the
oil
shale,
but
if
oil
shale
is
not
a
valuable
mineral
that
reservation
is
invalid
and
therefore
the
farmers
and
the
ranchers
will
pick
up
the
oil
shale
which
will
be
roughly
about
the
amount
of
oil
shale
that
is
still
being
claimed.
finally,
we
come
to
the
estoppel
argument.
our
position
on
estoppel
is,
of
course,
the
court
has
never
said
the
government
could
be
estopped.
it
has
come
up
to
the
brink
and
looked
at
it
as
in
the
moser
case
but
it
has
not
decided
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken
the
view
that
the
government
may
be
estopped.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
with
all
respect,
we
do
not
read
that
as
meaning
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
government
cannot
be
estopped.
we
read
it
as
saying
the
government
could
not
be
estopped
in
that
case.
if
i
am
wrong
in
that,
if
this
court
has
decided
and
is
going
to
continue
to
hold
that
the
government
cannot
be
estopped,
my
argument
is
no
good.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
at
all.
our
argument
is
that
the
estoppel
cases
where
it
has
been
held
that
the
government
could
not
be
estopped
fall
in
general
into
several
categories
and
this
is
not
one
of
them.
they
fall
into
cases
where
someone
has
acted
outside
the
scope,
some
government
agency
has
acted
outside
the
scope
of
the
authority
that
is
given
to
it
and
here
obviously
we
have
the
secretary
involved
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority.
two,
where
the
estoppel
is
sought
to
achieve
a
result
that
has
been
expressly
prohibited
by
statute,
of
course,
we
take
the
180-degree
position
on
that,
but
here
statutes
are
on
our
side.
three,
we
take
the
position,
of
course,
that
the
estoppel
turns
on
its
own
facts
and
would
argue
that
with
the
extension
of
government
into
the
affairs
of
the
citizens
far
beyond
that
contemplated,
that
estoppel
in
a
gross
case
of
a
responsible
government
agency,
top
government
official
such
as
a
secretary,
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
even
though,
as
we
argue,
acting
incorrectly,
that
estoppel
is
proper
but
that
is
a
question
of
policy.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes,
i
think
it
does,
because
in
the
case
of
long
administrative
construction,
one,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
dealing
with
equities
so
much
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
rights
of
a
particular
citizen,
one
is
dealing
with
a
principle
of
government.
it
doesn't
just
affect
the
parties
in
the
case
but
it
is
a
matter
that
affects
the
way
the
society
operates
and
what
the
rule
of
law
means
as
distinguished
from
what
is
equitable
in
a
particular
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
from
the
legal
and
perhaps
the
philosophical
standpoint
it
is
quite
one
thing
for
the
judicial
branch
to
say
you
must
not
be
capricious
in
general,
you
must
not
come
and
go
and
change
rules,
people
must
be
entitled
to
know
what
the
law
is
as
against
saying
in
a
particular
case
--
in
this
case,
the
conduct
is
so
unfair,
to
use
the
language
of
the
moser
case,
so
unfair
and
gross
as
in
this
case,
where
it
has
been
relied
on
for
years
and
millions
of
dollars
have
been
spent,
in
the
case
of
this
particular
party
you
may
not
do
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
and
we
argue
in
our
briefs,
absolutely,
whereas
if
my
philosophy
is
right
one
shouldn't.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
the
difference.
we
had
a
problem
finding
out
what
you
meant
by
the
cert
petition,
as
you
know.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes,
that
is
the
difference
and
we
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
difference
between
the
individual
and
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
if
i
may,
i
will
just
take
thirty
seconds
more.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
benefits
that
have
flowed
from
this
solution
are
these.
there
are
now
--
our
government
has
three
processes
in
which
we
can
make
oil
out
of
this
material
that
are
workable
and
practicable
and
will
produce
it
in
quantities
that
are
significant
in
terms
of
a
plant
being
50,000
barrels
a
day.
we
have
that.
the
reason
we
--
we
have
24
different
corporations
who
are
cited
in
the
record
who
have
twenty
years
of
know-how
and
experience

development
in
this
area.
if
we
hadn't
had
this
particular
solution,
we
wouldn't
have
put
those
millions
into
this
business
and
we
wouldn't
now
be
in
a
position
where
all
the
president
has
to
do
is
decide
to
spend
the
money
and
we
can
start
overcoming
some
of
the
problems
that
are
obvious
to
all
of
us.
thank
you
very
much.
