justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
is
an
issue
here?
isn't
that
one
of
the
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
initially
we
must
decide
what
how
are
the
mining
laws
to
be
construed
insofar
as
discovery
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
a
novel
question
in
the
interior
department
until
recently.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
had
been
decided
forty
years
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
don't
i
recall
that
sometimes
here
we
have
approved
an
administrative
reading
and
then
some
years
later
approved
a
quite
contrary
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
for
example
we
would
be
free
to
having
perhaps
construed
the
law
differently
than
freeman
did,
to
later
say
freeman
was
correctly
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
a
patent
when
it
is
finally
issued
be
set
aside
for
mistake
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
these
had
actually
been
patented
rather
than
just
unpatented
locations,
they
could
not
be
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
interior
department's
view
was
expressed
openly
immediately
after
the
passage
in
1920,
wasn't
it,
by
a
set
of
instructions?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
purported
to
be
a
construction
of
what
the
law
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
on
a
factual
aspect,
you
start
out
i
think
indicating
five
million
acres
were
subject
to
claims
that
were
during
this
time
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
estimate.
does
that
include
those
that
went
to
patent
or
just
those
that
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
large
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
acreage
patent
was
349,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hamilton,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
figures
are
so
widely
different.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
mr.
wallace
to
say
there
are
five
million
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
there
is
only
roughly
the
same
amount
as
the
349,000
that
have
been
patented.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
any
neutral
source
enlighten
us
as
to
which
of
you
is
correct
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
as
of
what
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
and
that
is
in
the
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
one
mistake,
mr.
hamilton.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
pronounce
placer
that
way
out
in
our
country,
you
get
your
claim
cancelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
placer.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
differ
too
much
from
an
administrative
construction,
a
long
continuing
administrative
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
only
question
you
presented
in
your
petition,
should
we
remand
on
the
estoppel
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
submitting
it
here
and
