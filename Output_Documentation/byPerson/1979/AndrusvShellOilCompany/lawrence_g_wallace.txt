mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
claims
to
oil
shale
on
federal
lands
made
some
sixty
or
more
years
ago
under
the
mineral
laws,
the
mining
laws
i
should
say,
pardon
me,
of
1870
and
1872
are
valid
and
entitle
the
claimant
successors
an
interest
to
patents
under
those
laws
conveying
title
to
these
public
lands
to
them.
such
unpatented
oil
shale
claims
are
outstanding
on
an
estimated
five
million
acres
of
public
lands
in
colorado,
utah
and
wyoming.
all
of
the
claims
date
from
before
february
25,
1920,
which
was
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
withdrew
oil
shale
and
other
specified
minerals
from
further
location
under
the
mining
laws
and
provided
for
future
access
to
these
minerals
only
by
leasing
with
the
title
to
the
lands
remaining
in
the
united
states.
the
law
was
part
of
the
conservation
movement
designed
for
protection
of
the
public
domain
from
what
congress
considered
to
be
unwarranted
alienation
by
claims
to
widespread
minerals
specified
in
the
act.
the
particular
claims
at
issue
here
date
from
1917
and
1918,
in
the
period
this
court
has
characterized
in
hickel
v.
oil
shale
company
is
one
of
speculative
fever
in
oil
shale
claims.
and
the
precise
question
involved
is
whether
the
precise
claims
are
invalid
because
of
the
failure
of
oil
shale
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
mining
law
of
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
in
this
case,
the
administrative
law
judge,
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
agreed
that
the
claim
did
not
meet
the
traditional
discovery
standard
under
the
mining
laws.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
issue
tested
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
far
from
a
novel
question
in
this
court,
mr.
justice
white,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't
agree
with
that
proposition
either.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
treated
it
differently
than
other
decisions
of
both
the
interior
department
and
of
this
court,
which
is
what
i
wish
to
turn
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
argument
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
an
issue
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct,
although
our
submission
is
that
it
is
not
correct.
of
course,
that
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
a
factual
issue
but
it
is
mixed
up
with
an
issue
of
law
which
i
think
has
long
been
settled
and
let
me
turn
to
the
considerations
that
bear
on
that
and
that
bear
on
other
aspects
of
the
case
as
well.
the
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
four
tribunals
below
is
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
and
on
page
25
--
i
am
turning
myself
to
page
24,
the
administrative
law
judge
based
his
holding
on
this
aspect,
if
i
may
just
read
the
bottom
part
of
the
quoted
portion
"until
a
research
program
had
demonstrated
that
shale
oil
could
be
produced
at
a
cost
competitive
with
petroleum,
no
prudent
person
would
attempt
to
develop
an
oil
shale
mine.
he
would
have
no
market
for
his
product.
the
very
fact
that,
in
the
more
than
half
a
century
of
interest
in
oil
shale
claims
of
the
green
river
formation,
not
one
profitable
mine
has
been
developed
is
a
compelling
reason
for
concluding
that
expenditure
of
money
to
that
end
would
be
imprudent."
and
indeed
the
board
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
no
profitable
operation
of
any
kind
from
oil
shale
has
been
developed
in
this
country
in
a
hundred
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
concluded
in
these
very
cases
that
freeman
v.
summers
was
incorrect
and
it
changes
its
position
in
these
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
can
only
change
its
position
in
interpretation
of
the
law,
but
as
i
am
about
to
demonstrate
to
the
court,
if
i
may,
freeman
v.
summers
was
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
very
law
that
interior
misconstrued
in
freeman
v.
summers.
and
if
i
can
proceed
to
show
that,
i
then
would
submit
that
the
interior
department
had
no
choice
but
to
conform
its
practices
to
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
mining
law,
that
law
has
not
been
changed
by
congress
and
this
court
has
not
overruled,
indeed
it
has
reaffirmed
those
interpretations.
so
this
is
not
really
a
question
of
the
interior
department's
discretion
to
change
its
own
interpretation
of
the
law,
it
is
really
a
matter
of
conforming
its
interpretation
to
this
court's
authoritative
interpretation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
certainly
did.
it
corrected
its
error.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can
happen
within
an
area
of
an
agency's
discretion
to
construe
terms
of
a
statute
which
can
fairly
be
construed
in
different
ways.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
freeman
never
purported
to
apply
a
different
standard
to
anything
but
oil
shale
and
the
interior
department
over
the
years
adhered
to
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
mining
laws
for
all
other
minerals
and
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
treating
oil
shale
differently
from
other
minerals.
there
is
no
arguable
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
can
support
this
disparity
in
administrative
practice
that
the
department
has
now
corrected.
the
customary
standard
has
been
articulated
in
a
number
of
this
court's
modern
decisions
as
a
reflecting
a
determination
by
congress
that
public
lands
would
be
virtually
free
for
the
taking
by
private
interests
under
the
mining
laws
in
return
for
the
discovery
of
a
commercially
valuable
mineral
deposit
that
can
enure
to
the
public
benefit
by
being
introduced
into
the
economy,
and
for
that
reason
the
profitability
and
marketability
of
a
mining
claim
to
exploit
that
resources
has
been
the
consistent
standard.
rather
than
refer
to
the
more
familiar
recent
decisions,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
turn
to
some
of
the
earlier
decisions
in
which
this
standard
was
established.
one
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
is
cameron
v.
united
states,
252
u.s.,
which
was
decided
in
1920,
less
than
two
months
after
the
enactment
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
and
there
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
vander,
whom
the
court
later
recognized
as
having
unique
knowledge
in
this
field,
the
court
articulated
the
meaning
of
a
valuable
mineral
discovery
in
much
the
terms
that
the
modern
cases
do.
and
if
i
may
support
from
page
459
"to
support
a
mining
location,
discovery
should
be
such
as
would
justify
a
person
of
ordinary
prudence
in
the
further
expenditure
of
his
time
and
means
in
an
effort
to
develop
a
paying
mine."
and
then
quite
significantly
this
is
not
a
novel
or
mistaken
test
but
is
one
which
the
land
department
long
has
applied
and
this
court
has
approved,
citing
christman
v.
miller,
197
u.s.,
a
1905
decision
of
this
court
and
also
a
unanimous
decision.
the
particular
page
reference
in
christman
v.
miller
--
and
this
is
also
a
case
that
is
cited
in
brief,
it
is
in
197
u.s.
--
is
page
322
which
quoted
with
approval
the
classic
statement
reproduced
on
page
19
of
our
brief
of
the
interior
department
in
castle
v.
womble
of
the
standard
which
is
largely
along
the
same
lines
as
set
forth
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
but
of
perhaps
even
greater
pertinence
to
the
particular
question
before
us
now
is
the
precise
holding
of
christman
v.
miller,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
two
sentences
from
the
concluding
paragraph
of
this
court's
opinion
there,
page
323
of
197
u.s.
referring
to
the
claimant
whose
claims
were
rejected
below
and
the
judgment
rejecting
those
claims
was
being
affirmed,
there
was
not
enough
in
what
he
claims
to
have
seen
to
have
justified
a
prudent
person
in
the
expenditure
of
money
and
labor
in
exploitation
for
petroleum.
it
merely
suggested
a
possibility
that
the
ground
contained
oil
sufficient
to
make
it
chiefly
valuable
therefore,
and
that
was
not
enough
under
the
mining
law.
now,
if
we
turn
from
that
to
the
interior
department's
opinion
in
1927,
22
years
later,
in
freeman
v.
summers,
and
this
on
page
67
of
the
appendix
in
the
case,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
of
that
opinion
in
which
the
rationale
used
by
the
interior
department
was
precisely
the
rationale
that
this
court
rejected
in
interpreting
the
same
law
in
the
christman
case
"there
can
be
no
question
whatever
as
to
the
greater
valuable
the
lands
for
their
oil
shale
deposits
than
for
other
purposes.
their
agricultural
value
is
negligible;
their
value
for
grazing
purposes
is
nominal,
and
the
real
and
principal
value
is
the
mineral
deposits,"
precisely
what
this
court
held
not
to
qualify
as
a
basis
for
upholding
a
claim
to
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
under
the
mining
law.
in
retrospect,
what
started
out
in
the
early
twenties,
when
the
interior
department
first
began
patenting
oil
shale
claims
as
predominantly
in
the
state
of
fact
that
oil
shale
might
be
then
meeting
the
standard
under
the
mining
law
as
interpreted
in
this
court's
cases,
because
of
optimistic
predictions
of
the
imminence
of
marketability
of
oil
shale,
it
started
off
in
the
initial
patents
as
predominantly
a
mistake
of
fact
and
we
noted
incidentally
in
our
brief
on
page
29
that
the
instructions
of
the
secretary
under
which
these
initial
patents
were
granted
did
not
say
that
oil
shale
could
proceed
to
patent
under
any
different
standards
and
indeed
said
that
the
same
standards
must
be
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can
be
set
aside
only
for
six
years.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
mr.
justice.
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
would
be
binding.
and
since
no
patents
have
been
issued
since
1960,
none
of
them
would
now
be
subject
to
being
set
aside.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
so
long
as
there
was
no
fraud
in
failure
to
disclose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
not
aware
of
any
effort
to
do
so.
it
was
not
until
1974
that
the
board
of
land
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case.
he
said
he
was
bound
by
freeman
v.
summers
even
though
he
thought
the
case
was
poorly
conceived
and
that
the
established
standards
under
the
mining
law
would
not
support
the
issuance
of
a
patent
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
not
aware
that
it
does
show
that.
it
does
show
that
the
solicitor
in
the
department
and
all
of
his
subordinates
refused
to
draft
the
opinion
because
they
thought
that
it
was
reflecting
an
incorrect
standard.
the
point
i
was
just
making
was
that
what
started
off
in
the
early
twenties
as
what
seems
to
me
in
retrospect
to
be
a
predominantly
mistake
of
fact
was
then
perpetuated
as
an
administrative
practice
through
what
is
clearly
a
mistake
of
law
in
applying
a
standard
that
is
contradictory
to
this
court's
reading
of
the
mining
law
to
oil
shale
without
any
basis
in
the
statute
for
singling
out
oil
shale
for
different
treatment.
so
the
background
against
which
any
action
congress
has
subsequently
taken
is
to
be
judged
at
most
as
an
element
of
ambiguity
introduced
by
the
administrative
practice
that
coexisted
with
this
court's
decisions
looking
the
other
way
as
to
what
the
governing
legal
standard
was
under
the
mining
law
long
before
any
of
the
developments
with
respect
to
oil
shale
that
are
put
in
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
instructions
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
the
instructions
did
not
make
a
mistake
of
law.
they
noted
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
development
with
respect
to
oil
shale,
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
it
and
said,
as
we
quote
on
the
top
of
page
29
of
our
brief,
that
the
same
legal
standard
should
be
applied.
and
under
those
instructions,
the
functionaries
in
the
department
then
began
issuing
patents
on
oil
shale
which
in
retrospect,
as
i
have
said,
looks
like
a
mistake
of
fact
but
not
a
mistake
of
law
predominantly.
these
things
emerge
with
greater
clarity
in
retrospect
perhaps
than
at
the
time.
but
i
would
say
that
when
the
basis
for
the
mistake
in
fact,
the
mistake
of
fact
began
to
dissipate,
rather
than
change
the
practice,
the
practice
was
perpetuated
in
freeman
v.
summers
by
a
mistake
of
law,
adopted
by
the
assistant
secretary
over
the
objection
of
the
solicitor's
office.
so
it
isn't
really
accurate
in
our
submission
to
judge
any
subsequent
action
has
taken
as
if
it
were
taken
against
a
background
of
settled
law
in
favor
of
these
oil
shale
claims
as
qualifying
under
the
mining
law
when
this
court's
decisions
looked
the
other
way
in
construing
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
legal
standard
to
be
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
an
estimate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
349,000
acres
have
been
patented.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr
justice.
now,
in
the
actions
that
congress
has
taken
that
were
relied
upon
by
the
courts
below
and
by
the
respondents
as
in
some
method
having
amended
the
standard
of
the
mining
law
and
setting
a
unique
standard
for
oil
shale,
as
the
two
courts
below
specified,
the
principal
reliance
is
now
placed,
as
i
read
respondent's
brief,
on
the
savings
provision
of
the
mining
law
of
1920.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
some
play
in
the
question
of
imminence
in
the
profitability
of
the
mine,
but
the
consistent
course
of
interpretation
has
been
that
it
has
to
be
imminent
rather
than
speculative.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
wasn't,
but
freeman
v.
summers
in
our
submission
an
aberration
from
the
womble
standard
which
was
the
predominant
view
approved
by
the
court
over
and
over
again,
expenditure
of
labor
and
means
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
in
developing
a
valuable
mine.
certainly
no
formulation
that
had
ever
made
contemplated
holding
of
fallow
claims
and
dealing
in
them
for
a
period
of
more
than
sixty
years
while
nothing
could
be
returned
to
the
public
and
then
valid
claims
could
be
made
for
alienation
of
a
large
acreage
of
the
public
domains
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
holding.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
formulation
which
would
look
toward
that
kind
of
speculative
interest.
it
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
in
coleman
was
not
authorized
under
the
mining
law.
i
would
like
to
make
one
basic
point
about
the
reading
that
is
proposed
of
the
savings
clause
in
the
mineral
leasing
act,
and
that
is
the
implausibility
of
that
reading
as
a
matter
of
the
common
sense
of
what
congress
was
doing.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
put
an
end
to
alienation
of
the
public
lands
through
mining
claims
based
on
some
of
the
more
widespread
mineral
resources
which
it
appeared
would
result
in
very
widespread
alienation
of
the
public
lands
beyond
what
could
be
exploited
in
the
near
future
because
the
minerals
were
so
widespread.
the
ones
that
were
singled
out
in
that
law,
oil
shale,
coal,
oil
phosphate,
were
ones
that
were
thought
to
exist
in
such
great
quantity
as
to
endanger
wholesale
alienation
of
the
public
lands
beyond
the
purposes
for
the
original
mining
law
of
giving
people
a
way
to
get
title
in
return
for
commercial
exploitation
of
valuable
mineral
resources.
there
had
to
be
some
savings
provision
as
congress
developed
the
law
both
because
of
fifth
amendment
problems
with
whatever
rights
people
had
in
their
claims
under
the
old
mining
law
and
to
prevent
unfairness.
but
it
obviously
would
be
contrary
to
the
whole
purpose
of
the
legislation
to
read
into
the
savings
provision
an
intent
to
make
further
alienation
of
the
public
lands
possible
through
claims
on
oil
shale
than
had
been
authorized
by
the
prior
law
when
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
curtail
alienations
of
the
public
lands
through
such
claims.
it
was
dissatisfaction
with
the
old
system
and
the
possibility
that
these
wholesale
alienations
would
occur
through
claims
on
the
specified
minerals
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
act
in
the
first
place.
so
it
would
take
a
compelling
indication
in
the
language
or
history
of
the
statute
to
conclude
that
the
savings
clause
should
be
interpreted
at
cross
purposes
with
the
basic
thrust
of
the
legislation
and
the
thing
that
moved
congress
to
enact
it.
and
far
from
that
we
have,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
hickel
case,
a
carefully
drafted
provision
in
the
savings
clause
that
refers
to
the
standards
of
the
mining
law
having
to
be
met.
the
two
subsequent
developments
in
congress
referred
to
did
not
result
in,
in
one
case
in
any
legislation
and
in
the
other
case
in
anything
that
could
conceivably
be
construed
as
affecting
the
standards
of
discovery
because
it
was
devoted
to
a
discrete
matter.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
like
to
say
first
that
there
are
an
estimated
five
million
acres
which
i
have
gotten
from
the
department
of
the
interior,
is
based
on
an
extrapolation
from
the
study
that
is
in
the
record
which
relates
to
only
the
county
in
the
area
in
colorado,
and
that
extrapolation
then
would
take
in
the
other
counties
in
colorado
and
the
areas
in
wyoming
and
utah
which
were
not
included
in
this
study
of
court
house
filings.
so
it
is
an
extrapolation
from
that
study
on
which
we
base
an
estimate
not
in
the
record
of
five
million
acres.
the
difference
between
what
is
a
valuable
mineral
resource
for
purposes
of
classification
and
what
is
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mining
laws
for
purposes
of
giving
someone
a
right
to
relinquishment
of
federal
title
to
the
lands
is
explained
in
detail
by
the
board
of
appeals
in
footnote
59
of
its
opinion
starting
on
page
115a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
we
don't
believe
that
classification
has
anything
to
do
with
the
problem
in
this
case
because,
as
this
court's
opinion
that
i
quoted
to
you,
the
1905
opinion
earlier
held
that
land
can
be
chiefly
valuable
for
its
mineral
resources
and
still
not
qualify
under
the
mining
law
as
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
subject
to
current
exploitation.
the
other
authorities
to
the
same
effect
are
collected
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
including
in
the
footnote
there
an
1891
decision
of
this
court
which
we
quote,
stating
that
the
existence
of
the
mineral
must
be
in
such
quantities
as
would
justify
expenditure
and
the
effort
to
obtain
it
established
as
a
present
fact.
the
standard
under
mining
law
was
well
established
even
before
the
1905
decision
to
which
i
called
the
court's
attention
because
of
the
fact
that
the
rationale
of
freeman
v.
summers
was
so
contrary
to
it.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
estoppel
question.
the
court
has
never
held
the
united
states
to
be
estopped
by
the
acts
of
its
agents
and
certainly
in
accordance
with
the
cases
that
have
been
decided,
the
poorest
context
in
which
to
start
would
be
on
a
question
of
alienation
of
the
lands
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
congress.
the
claims
involved
here
were
described,
the
kinds
of
claims
involved
here
were
described
by
this
court
in
best
v.
humboldt
mining
as
a
unique
form
of
property.
they
are
conditional
on
annual
assessment
work.
they
are
defeasible
if
the
mineral
resource
ceases
to
be
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
their
validity
is
not
administratively
reviewed
in
any
way
until
a
patent
application
is
filed
with
the
department.
indeed,
the
claim
needn't
even
specify
what
mineral
it
is
that
has
been
discovered.
and
congress,
by
providing
a
six-year
limitation
period
after
the
issuance
of
the
patent
for
contesting
the
validity
of
the
patent,
has
specified
the
only
way
in
which
the
united
states
will
be
estopped
by
administrative
error
under
the
mining
laws
which
would
have
the
effect
of
alienating
the
public
lands
to
private
interests
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
the
mining
laws,
are
not
authorized
by
congress
itself,
and
i
believe
shows
in
detail
why
none
of
the
other
traditional
tests
for
estoppel
would
apply
here
in
any
event.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
no
recourse
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
urge
the
court
to
decide
it
because
until
it
is
decided,
litigation
about
these
claims
will
have
to
continue.
there
is
related
pending
litigation
about
--
which
has
to
go
claim
by
claim
about
whether
the
requisite
assessment
work
was
done
in
this
period
annually
over
a
period
of
more
than
sixty
years,
and
it
is
better
for
the
question
to
be
settled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
and
the
court
granted
the
petition
and
--
the
district
court
passed
on
the
question,
we
think
the
question
is
a
clear
one,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
a
holding
of
estoppel.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
it.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
does
not
mean
that
the
respondents
and
others
similarly
situated
are
without
any
recourse.
they
would
then
be
remitted
to
present
their
equities
to
congress
which
would
have
the
flexibility
of
making
whatever
adjustments
it
might
think
appropriate
in
response
to
the
equities
they
show,
such
as
a
preference
under
the
leasing
law
which
is
the
way
congress
since
1920
has
said
the
access
to
this
kind
of
mineral
deposits
should
be
restricted.
thank
you.
