justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
i
ask
a
question
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
not
entirely
clear
yet
as
to
who
may
picket
a
residence.
let's
assume
that
the
fifth
--
that
the
20
people
who
were
picketing
this
residence
were
all
employed
in
the
neighborhood,
say
as
domestics,
but
only
one
of
the
20
was
employed
in
the
residence
of
the
mayor
and
he
or
she
had
a
disagreement
with
the
mayor
or
his
wife.
did
all
20
continued
to
picket?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
the
19
have
to
be
domestics
employed
somewhere
or
could
--
could
the
--
the
one
domestic
recruit,
19
friends
from
all
over
the
city
and
bring
them
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
it
could
be
100
instead
of
19.
