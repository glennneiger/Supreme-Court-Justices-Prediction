mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
what
is
--
what
wrong
fundamentally
with
the
illinois
residential
picketing
statute
is
simply
that
it
is
not
narrowly
drawn.
because
it
not
narrowly
drawn,
it
is
under
inclusive
and
it
is
over
inclusive
and
it
is
vague
and
it
violates
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
law.
your
honors,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
illinois
can
constitutionally
and
by
a
narrowly
drawn
statute,
protect
residential
privacy
from
invasion
by
noisy
tramping,
threatening
picketers.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
constitutionally,
illinois
could
put
--
limit
on
the
number
of
pickets.
i
think
they
could
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
we
--
our
--
our
contention
is
that
illinois
could
not
constitutionally
prohibit
all
picketing
--
all
picketing
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
--
from
streets
and
sidewalks.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
there
is
no
compelling
reason
for
eliminating
even
all
--
all
residential
picketing
that
they
could
--
that
the
state's
interest
in
preserving
the
right
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
the
home
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
elimination
even
of
all
residential
picketing
because
limits
could
be
put
--
more
narrow
limits
could
put
in
this
kind
of
picketing.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
disputing
exactly
what
the
limits
are
and
how
many
people
can
picket,
at
what
times,
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
disputing
the
state's
right
to
totally
limit
this
first
amendment
protected
activity
from
the
residential
streets
and
sidewalks
in
--
in
the
state.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
i
agree
that
that
is
the
argument,
your
honor.
they
--
go
here,
they
have
totally
banned
it
and
the
contention
is
they
--
they
did
not
have
to
totally
ban
it
in
order
to
safeguard
any
interest
they
might
have
in
protecting
residential
privacy.
however,
this
is
really
our
--
our
second
argument,
our
contention
that
the
statute
is
over
inclusive.
i
think
our
--
our
principal
argument
is
that
the
statute
violates
equal
protection
in
the
first
amendment
because
it
is
not
under
inclusive.
that
is
because
it
makes
an
exception
for
labor
picketing
and
--
and
that
distinction
is
clearly
a
content
based
distinction.
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
necessarily
because
i
believe
the
object
of
the
picketing
in
that
case
is
what
is
traditionally
been
regarded
an
illegal
object,
an
intent
to
obstruct
justice
or
to
influence
justice
and
in
that
case,
i
think
certainly
a
distinction
can
be
made.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
i
think
that
with
their
--
if
the
intent
of
the
picketing
is
to
--
is
--
is
to
interfere
with
--
with
justice
--
with
the
process
of
justice
or
to
influence
justice
in
some
way
because
i
think
the
argument
really
--
the
rationale
behind
cox
versus
louisiana
if
i
understand
it
is
that
picketing
there
was
--
was
aimed
at
an
illegal
--
had
an
--
really
an
illegal
object
and
that
the
preservation
of
--
of
really
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
of
justice
that
was
uninfluenced
by
things
that
should
not
influence
the
decisions
of
the
courts,
really
was
a
compelling
reason
for
prohibiting
the
picketing
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
it
would
--
i
--
if
illinois
could
--
could
show
that
by
--
that
picketing
the
residence
of
a
judge
was
--
was
likely
to
result
in
the
obstruction
of
justice
or
likely
to
impair
the
quality
of
justice
in
illinois,
then
i
think
they
would
have
at
least
an
argument.
they
would
have
a
compelling
reason
or
--
for
arguably
a
compelling
reason
if
they
could
show
that.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
in
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
could
we
have
picketed
--
could
someone
had
picketed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
under
--
under
the
illinois
statute,
picketing
judge
tone's
home
in
this
case
would've
been
prohibited.
the
statute
would've
prohibited
it.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
right.
now,
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
we've
--
our
position
would
be
that
illinois
could
--
my
position
would
be
that
illinois
could
not
constitutionally
prohibit
picketing
judge
tone's
home
without
making
some
showing
that
that
kind
of
picketing
was
--
was
actually
going
to
result
in
the
--
in
influencing
decisions.
now,
it
may
not
be
that
they
have
to
show
an
effort
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
think
showing
generally
supporting
the
legislation
that
--
i
--
i
doubt
if
we
can
judge
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
in
--
indeed,
i'm
sure
they
are
generally
but
i
believe
that
if
illinois
could
make
that
showing,
then
they
would
have
at
least
arguably
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
don't
believe
a
mere
statement
of
the
legislature
that
this
is
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
it
would
be
my
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
at
least
the
mere
finding
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no,
i
--
i
would
not
think
so
in
--
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
concerned.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
shows
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
i'm
not
contending
that
in
order
--
that
if
such
a
statute
were
passed
in
order
for
it
to
be
upheld
constitutionally,
it
would
have
to
be
shown
in
every
case
that
the
picketing
was
reasonably
likely
to
influence
the
judge
in
anyway.
i
--
i
do
say
--
i
simply
say
that
i
think
that
the
--
the
hypothetical
statute
can
--
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
and
because
there,
there
would
be
at
least
arguably
some
compelling
reason
for
the
distinction,
whereas
in
this
case,
there
is
no
compel
--
there
is
no
reason
for
allowing
labor
picketing
and
for
not
allowing
any
other
form
of
picketing.
the
only
distinction
between
this
case
and
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
perhaps
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
the
first
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
actually,
we
have
three.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
and
the
third
goes
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
and
that
the
first
attack
is
based
on
the
content
discrimination
which
i
believe
maybe
characterized
as
either
a
fourteenth
amendment
attack
--
attack
or
a
first
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
the
one
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
and
so
i
believe
this
can
be
characterize
--
our
first
argument
maybe
properly
characterized
as
an
equal
protection
argument
and
a
first
amendment
argument
because
there
is
no
compelling
reason
for
discriminating
among
the
pickets
and
also
the
control
--
the
statute
attempts
to
control
the
content
of
the
message
on
the
picket
signs.
the
second
argument
is
a
first
amendment
argument
is
applied
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
your
honors,
the
only
--
the
only
distinction
that
the
state
can
draw
between
this
case
and
the
mosley
case
is
that
you
do
--
instead,
the
ordinance
in
mosley
you
attempted
to
safeguard
the
right
of
the
quiet
classrooms
and
in
this
case,
the
right
is
quite
enjoinment
of
the
home.
i
submit
that
that
difference
makes
absolutely
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
argument.
there
is
no
more
reason
for
allowing
labor
picketing
in
a
school
and
prohibiting
all
other
picketing
than
there
is
for
allowing
a
labor
picketing
at
a
residence
and
allowing
all
of
the
other
picketing.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
it
depends,
your
honor
what
the
term
places
of
employment
includes.
most
residences
i
--
i
assume
do
not
have
maids
or
gardeners.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
domestic
employees.
on
the
other
hand,
they
do
--
most
homes
do
bring
in
workmen
and
under
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
workman
is
working
at
the
home
that
the
home
is
a
place
of
employment
and
if
he's
a
non-union
workman,
the
union
can
picket
both
the
workman
and
the
homeowner.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
in
terms
the
difference
between
labor
picketing
and
all
other
picketing.
i
will
agree
that
the
right
that
--
that
schools
are
different
from
residences
and
the
right
of
privacy,
residential
privacy
is
certainly
different
from
the
right
of
quiet
classrooms
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
quiet
classrooms.
but
in
terms
--
but
that
is
no
justification
for
allowing
only
labor
picketing
in
one
case
and
not
allowing
only
labor
picketing
in
the
other
case.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
the
rights
that
--
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
that
--
that
justifies
discrimination
in
favor
of
labor
picketing
in
a
residential
situation,
but
doesn't
justify
it
in
a
school
situation.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
the
--
the
point
is
that
that
--
there
is
no
compelling
reason
for
making
that
distinction.
what
the
statute
says
in
effect
is
that
if
you
--
if
you
bring
a
--
a
non-union
carpenter
in
to
work
on
your
roof,
you
have
waived
the
right
to
--
your
right
to
privacy
insofar
as
labor
picketing
is
concerned.
but
if
your
--
if
your
home
is
a
landmark
and
you
attempt
to
alter
it,
the
--
that
does
not
waive
your
right
of
privacy
insofar
as
the
historical
society
is
concerned.
and
they
cannot
come
in
and
picket
because
you
are
altering
a
landmark.
our
position
is
there
--
there
is
no
--
no
reason
and
certainly
no
compelling
reason
for
making
that
discrimination
in
favor
of
labor
disputes
and
--
and
against
everyone
else.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
assuming
in
my
hypothetical
that
it
--
everyone
would
concede
that
it
was
a
landmark,
perhaps
the
public.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
then
i
--
even
if
it
was
not
clearly
a
landmark,
if
the
picketers
picket
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
suppose
that
that
would
--
that
hypothetical
would
work
also
they're
not
quite
as
well
for
me.
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
--
interest
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no.
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
reason
for
allowing
--
for
saying
that
the
homeowner
waives
his
right
to
privacy
if
he
--
if
he
brings
a
workman
into
his
home
and
not
saying
that
he
waives
that
right
of
privacy
for
the
myriad
other
purposes
about
which
people
might
picket
him.
for
example,
if
he
puts
in
opposing
candidate's
political
poster
in
the
window
of
his
home,
the
opposite
party
is
not
allowed
to
carry
a
sign
in
front
of
the
--
in
front
of
the
home
in
favor
of
--
of
some
other
candidate.
and
yet,
why
if
he
brings
a
workman
into
his
home
does
he
waive
the
--
waive
his
right
to
privacy,
but
he
doesn't
waive
that
right
if
he
--
if
he
puts
a
political
poster
in
the
window.
there
should
--
there
is
simply
no
compelling
reason
for
making
that
distinction.
it's
--
it
is
--
that
moreover,
i
--
in
this
case,
we
have
a
legislative
statement
of
legislative
finding
and
intent
and
nowhere
in
the
statement
of
legislative
finding
on
intent,
is
there
any
indication
that
the
illinois
legislature
was
--
was
interested
in
providing
a
forum
for
labor
picketing.
in
fact,
in
the
statement
of
--
of
intent,
the
illinois
legislature
declares
that
they
find
all
residential
picketing
and
no
matter
how
--
just
the
cause
to
be
disruptive.
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
they
were
intending
to
afford
a
forum
for
labor
disputes
and
not
for
anything
else.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
there
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
official
history,
your
honor.
the
only
--
there
is
an
article
that
appears
in
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
appears
at
61
nw.
u.
l.
rev.
it
does
indicate
some
history.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
thank
you.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
mr.
chief
justice
thank
you,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
couple
of
questions
your
honors
were
addressed
to
ms.
robinson
that
i
would
i
like
to
comment
on.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
you
asked
a
question
about
the
gregory
case.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
and
i
would
simply
like
to
note
that
it's
clear
from
the
appendix
in
the
gregory
case
that
the
marching
parading
in
that
case
took
place
in
exactly
the
same
neighborhood
as
in
this
case.
that
the
--
while
not
the
same
mayor
was
involved,
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
chicago
was
a
--
the
residence
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
chicago
was
the
target
of
the
picketing
and
the
--
in
addition
to
that
the
message
was
the
same
that
you
have
picketing
concerning
desegregation
of
the
chicago
public
schools.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
but
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
the
permit
was
involved.
i'm
maybe
wrong
about
that.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
--
i
think
that
it's
--
that
the
parade
permit
ordinance
would
be
constitutional
--
could
be
constitutional
if
the
discrimination
--
if
--
if
there
--
if
it
were
no
way
based
on
content,
in
other
words,
if
the
--
if
a
permits
were
awarded
in
a
totally
content
free
manner.
i
think
if
the
--
if
the
permit
ordinance
required
that
the
content
of
the
message
be
reviewed
before
the
permit
was
granted
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
and
that
i
believe
that
when
they
are,
they
are
generally
upheld
as
being
constitutional.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
not
that
i
am
aware,
no
sir.
what
i
wish
to
point
out
about
the
gregory
case
was
that
this
court
in
gregory
specifically
said
that
if
the
parading
and
marching
in
that
case
was
peaceful.
it
was
certainly
protected
by
the
fist
amendment.
and
the
state
has
conceded
in
this
case
that
both
of
past
conduct
of
the
points
of
appellees
and
their
proposed
conduct
is
peaceful,
therefore,
we
conclude
that
under
gregory,
their
conduct
is
protected
by
the
fist
amendment.
mr.
justice
stevens
i
believe
you
asked
a
question
going
to
the
place
of
business
exception
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
clear,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
clear
from
the
statute
just
exactly
what
picketing
is
allowed
at
the
place
of
business.
for
example,
if
the
high
raise
lakepoint
towers
has
a
restaurant
in
the
building,
it
is
clear
that
the
restaurant
maybe
picketing,
and
not
only
for
a
labor
matters
but
for
other
matters.
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
residences
that
are
also
located
in
lakepoint
towers
maybe
picketed
by
for
anything
other
than
labor
disputes.
and
i
think
it
is
near
as
it
clear
if
a
high
raise
contains
only
condominiums
or
apartments
whether
that
--
whether
or
not
that
building
is
a
place
of
business.
in
addition,
i
don't
believe
it's
clear
whether
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
your
honor,
our
--
our
third
argument
is
bigness
argument;
i
believe
the
question
that
went
to
that
argument.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no
sir.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
--
that
both
the
employee
and
the
employer
maybe
the
target
of
--
of
the
picketing
under
the
exception
to.
in
other
the
union
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
so
that
the
statute
does
not
afford
a
forum
simply
for
an
employee
to
picket.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
your
honor
we
--
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
were
always
on
public
property,
the
public
--
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
front
of
the
residence
and
the
statute
is
being
enforced
against
persons
on
public
streets
and
sidewalks.
we
are
not
would
--
now
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
statute
would
permit
a
picketing
--
also
prohibit
residential
picketing,
if
that
picketing
occurred
private
property
with
the
concern
of
the
owner
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
we
do
raise,
we
do
raise
the
argument
and
we
argue
that
the
we,
although
it
was
not
involve
in
our
case
because
the
picketers
in
--
in
our
case
we
are
not
on
private
property
they
were
and
public
property,
we
do
argue
that
this
court
can
consider
the
facial
over
breadth
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
infringes
on
fist
amendment
protected
conduct.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
also
like
comment
the
--
the
state
has
mentioned
that
fcc
versus
pacifica
in
the
rowan
case
have
only
been
distinguished
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
dirty
words
cases.
they
certainly
are
dirty
words
cases,
but
in
addition
in
both
those
cases
there
was
a
actual,
physical
intrusion
if
you
will,
into
the
--
into
the
residence
and
into
the
home
and
that
is
not
the
case
here
where
the
plaintiffs
are
on
public
streets
and
sidewalks.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
and
i
certainly
concede
that
there
are
differences
between
the
cases.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
i
would
contend
that
the
--
that
it
is
if
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
and
i
think
lines
do
have
to
be
drawn
that
while
the
residential
privacy
it
is
certainly
is
a
compelling
reason
for
keeping
any
intrusion
anyone
from
intruding
into
the
residence.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
certainly
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
householder
had
a
right
to
request
that
the
erotic
and
sexually
provocative
material
not
be
mailed
into
his
home.
i
don't
think
it
would
--
perhaps
extend
if
the
matter
that
contained
in
the
mailing
list
is
political
material.
and
in
this
case
we
have
the
message
clearly
is
in
very
heart
of
--
of
political
speech.
your
honors
our
first
argument
was
that
by
allowing
peaceful
labor
picketing
and
totally
prohibiting
all
other
picketing
the
statute
violated
both
the
equal
protection
and
the
first
amendment
because
its
discrimination
is
based
solely
on
the
content
of
speech
and
there
is
no
compelling
reason
for
the
discrimination,
as
in
mosley
the
statute's
exception
for
labor
picketing
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no,
your
honor.
in
the
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
think
the
most
–
mosley
states
that
there
is
no
reason
for
content
control
of
messages.
at
least
on
--
at
least
to
the
extent
that
government
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
mosley
should
be
interpreted
your
honor
as
saying
that
it
is
absolutely
never
permitted
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
in
time
of
war
troop
movements
could
–
letting
out
information
about
time
the
troops
were
going
to
sail
might
--
might
be
prohibited
and
i
suppose
to
a
certain
extent
that
is
based
on
content.
i
don't
think
i
would
want
to
make
the
statement
absolutely.
i
do
think
however
that
in
absolute
statement
--
close
to
an
absolute
statement
can
be
made
that
government
can
not
control
what
the
public
issues
maybe
discus
in
public
forums
and
i
think
that
what
--
that
is
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
and
i
think
as
in
mosley
the
statute's
exception
for
labor
picketing
really
fatally
impeached
any
--
any
rationale
that
the
statute
might
have
for
prohibiting
all
other
peaceful
picketing
and
in
this
case
the
--
the
state
is
conceded
that
the
--
that
the
picketing
is
peaceful.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
yes.
certainly
a
--
a
reason
can
be
invented
but
it
--
i
think
the
reason
does
not
even
rise
to
the
level
of
the
rational
reason,
certainly
not
to
a
compelling
reason
and
in
no
way
can
it
be
sufficient
to
--
to
permit
the
state
to
control
the
content
of
speech
in
the
sense
that
in
no
way
should
it
be
allowed
to
this
judge
sufficient
to
control
the
--
of
what
public
issues
maybe
discussed
in
public
forums.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
no
your
honor,
our
argument
is
that
the
public
streets
and
sidewalks
in
--
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
mayor
bilandic
house
is
located
is
public
forum.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
it
is
the
--
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
picketing
in
the
general
residential
area,
it
prohibits
picketing
before
and
about
residences.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
but
in
--
but
the
affective
that
statute
if
--
if
it's
upheld
would
be
virtually
to
eliminate
picketing
in
residence
and
public
streets
and
sidewalks
before
and
about
residences
which
in
residential
area.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
in
with
--
with
the
message
your
honor
or
with
just
--
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
my
position
was
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
our
position
would
that
that
picketing
--
as
long
as
it
was
peaceful
would
be
protected
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
well,
this
statute
does
not
distinguish
between
public
officials
and
purely
private
persons.
it's
not
nearly
drawn
in
that
way.
i
don't
think
this
case
requires
a
decision
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
edward
burke
arnolds
thank
you
very
much.
