justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
conceivably,
there
might
be
a
movement
among
housemaids
to
organize
and
that
picketing
would
take
place
at
sites
of
--
where
housemaids
were
employed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
illinois
court
could
construe
it
either
way,
i
suppose
and
without
being
off
the
wall?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
seek
to
set
aside
their
guilty
pleading?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
could
climb
in
the
windows
if
they
wanted
to.
i
suppose
they
insisted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
raise
a
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
all
residential
picketing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
--
that
--
that's
always
been
the
argument
of
people
who
challenge
statutes
on
equal
protection
grounds
is
that
you
can't
do
it
this
way
but
you
could've
done
it
another
way.
i
mean
it
--
it's
not
a
very
novel
argument
to
say
they
didn't
do
it
quite
right
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you
--
you
are
conceding
i
take
it
that
they
could
have
--
illinois
could
have
regulated
residential
picketing
in
--
in
a
way
more
--
as
you
put
it,
narrowly
drawn
here.
and
my
comment
to
you
was
that
this
is
probably
the
classic
argument
of
any
person
assailing
a
statute
or
ordinance
on
equal
protection
grounds
is
that
--
not
that
you
couldn't
do
it
at
all
but
that
you
just
should've
done
it
a
little
differently
or
a
little
more
narrowly
or
a
lot
--
or
a
lot
a
little
more
latitudely.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
illinois
could've
enacted
a
statute
assuming
illinois
elects
judges
they
would've
prohibited
the
picketing
of
the
residence
of
a
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
--
it
was
clear,
this
picketing
was
just
designed
to
have
the
judge
come
out
a
certain
way
in
a
very
controversial
case
at
a
time
close
to
the
time
to
which
he
was
up
for
a
reelection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
constitutionally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly,
one
doesn't
think
of
schools
as
places
of
--
of
“privacy”
as
--
as
they
do
of
homes,
do
they?
it
may
serve
an
equal
or
perhaps
more
important
value,
but
isn't
that
in
large
part
for
the
state
to
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
residential
situation
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
says,
“only
when
the
owner
has
allowed
other
people
or
strangers
to
him
on
the
premises
is
labor
picketing
allowed,”
as
it's
used
as
a
place
of
business?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
--
it
is
a
vagueness
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
--
so
it's
not
strictly
speaking
equal
protection
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
true
the
ordinance
is
permitting
the
picketing
say
of
a
whole
of
an
apartment
building
where
an
a
plumber
is
inside
or
simply
the
outside
entrance
of
the
apartment
building?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
standing
to
rise
that
or
least
you
don't
raise
it
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
a
first
amendment
argument
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
you
argument
is
that
mayor
bilandic
house
is
public
forum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
--
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
this
house
is
what
we're
talking
about
not
just
the
general
residential
area
he
lived
in,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
and
--
and
not
in
residential
areas
(inaudible)
