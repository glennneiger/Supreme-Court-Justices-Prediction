chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
carey
against
brown.
ms.
robinson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
--
does
that
mean
some
kind
of
an
industrial
or
a
commercial
activity
or
does
it
include
a
house
where
they
have
a
housemaid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
does
include
the
house,
whether
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
order
to
have
the
picketing
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
dispute
between
the
housemaid
and
the
housewife,
is
--
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
just
the
existence
of
employment
on
the
premises
is
not
enough.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
ms.
robinson.
mr.
arnolds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
suggest
if
you
could
do
it
very
briefly
without
using
too
much
of
your
time,
what
kind
of
a
narrowing
would
make
it
past
muster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
but
it
couldn't
eliminate
them
entirely,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
that's
narrower
than
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
could
you
--
let's
--
let's
take
it
into
the
right
to
this
case
too
as
a
--
as
an
additional
question.
could
you
have
picketed
judge
tone
down
in
the
seventh
circuit
while
this
case
was
under
advisement
in
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
residential
picketing
him
around
at
his
home,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
--
we're
not
so
respondent,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
on
an
elective
judge
who
might
or
might
not
be
more
responsive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
decides
whether
the
place
is
a
landmark,
the
picketers
or
some
public
body?
you
--
you
used
the
phrase
landmark.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
everyone
--
everyone
except
the
owner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
want
to
make
it
a
landmark,
could
they
picket?
they're
trying
to
persuade
somebody
to
make
it
a
landmark?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
--
then
of
course
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
bunch
of
picketers
could
go
out
and
picket
in
this
case
of
yours
and
say,
“we
--
we
really
didn't
want
to
make
judge
tone's
home
a
landmark
and
that's
what
we're
picketing
for.”
are
you
suggesting
that
would
be
a
basis
for
picketing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
arnolds
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
--
was
there
a
parade
permit
in
the
gregory
case
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
make
a
difference
if
there
was
an
ordinance
which
said
you
can
do
something
if
you
get
a
parade
permit
but
impliedly
you
can't
do
that
if
you
don't
get
a
permit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
permit
ordinances
are
usually
neutral
in
the
sense
of
simply
requiring
notice
so
that
they
can
handle
traffic
problems
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
parade
permit
has
ever
been
upheld
here
as
it
that
mentioned
as
the
matter
of
content?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
--
but
in
rowan
it
wasn't
just
a
matter
of
throwing
away
their
mail,
it
was
the
statutory
–
the
householder
to
stop
the
mail
from
it
ever
coming
into
his
mail
box,
that's
even
a
little
different
from
--
either
the
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rowan
is
more
comfortable
to
stopping
the
picketing
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
the
claim
in
the
rowan
case
was
that
every
person
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
mail
--
any
mail
he
wanted
to,
to
any
person
wanted
to
and
congress
said
there
are
limits
and
court
sustained
those
limits
that
you've
can
not
mail
everything
and
anything
you
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
would
your
view
the
statute
be
the
same
in
application
if
instead
of
picketing
mayor
--
the
mayor's
place,
the
pickets
just
picket
out
arbitrarily
some
residential
district,
picketed
for
one
hour
in
front
of
your
house
and
one
hour
in
front
of
someone
else's
house
and
just
went
down
the
line,
no
specific
target.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
message,
yes
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
message
as
involved
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
--
in
the
same
category
whether
--
whether
the
mayor
was
the
target
or
just
some
taxpayer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
have
any
further
ms.
robinson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
concede
that's
in
the
context
of
labor
disputes
--
the
labor
area
generally
there
are
special
and
different
reasons
to
extend
protection
to
labor
picketing
as
distinguished
from
all
other
types?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
--
analogies
between
labor
picketing
and
other
types
aren't
trivially
helpful,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
