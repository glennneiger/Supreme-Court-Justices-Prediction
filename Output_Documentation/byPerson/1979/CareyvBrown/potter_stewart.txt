justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
depend
upon
whether
you
--
whether
the
residence
is
thought
to
be
the
whole
apartment
building
or
one
of
the
apartments
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suppose,
ms.
robinson,
the
legislature
had
in
mind
when
it
exempted
from
this
legislation
a
person
peacefully
picketing
in
his
own
residence,
what
kind
of
a
situation
would
that
be
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
protesting
the
landlord.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
gregory
case
from
your
city
of
chicago.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
what
were
the
facts
of
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
statute
read
literally,
can
be
read
at
least
as
not
to
require
that
the
picketing
be
concerning
the
labor
dispute?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
in
answer
then
to
my
brother
powell's
question,
the
answer
would
be
i
suppose
that
so
long
as
the
picketing
concerned
not
labor
relations
but
are
labor
dispute
but
rather
quite
a
different
subject
that
nobody
could
be
allowed
to
--
allowed
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
one
of
them
were
the
butler
of
the
mayor
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
have
an
argument
with
--
with
his
employer,
the
mayor
and
his
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
statutes
are
invalid
and
that
you
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
freedom
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
showing
that
in
a
particular
case,
showing
in
a
particular
case
or
showing
generally
supporting
the
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
because
kemp
against
florida
and
other
cases
say
the
judges
are
supposed
to
be
resolute
and
strong-minded
people
who
weren't
affected
by
these
things.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
a
mere
finding
by
a
legislative
--
legislature
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you'd
have
to
show
it
in
the
litigation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
your
submission.
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
vary
from
judge
to
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
vary
from
judge
to
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
some
judges
might
be
lighter
sleepers
than
others
for
example?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
that's
your
equal
protection
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
your
first
amendment
argument,
but
perhaps
i
was
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
two
separate
arguments,
two
separate
attacks
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
legislation,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they're
both
fourteenth
amendment
attacks,
aren't
they,
this
--
this
state
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
most
residences
these
days,
most
dwellings,
are
not
places
of
employment,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
household
employees,
home
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
legislative
history
of
this
more,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
it
was
amended
after
the
processes
of
enactment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
different
mayor
but
they
live
in
the
same
neighborhood?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
--
neither
those
cases
involved
of
physical
intrusion
of
people.
one
was,
radio
or
television
said
only
if
the
householder
turned
it
on
and
kept
on
that
channel
or
wave
length
station
and
the
other
was
piece
of
mail,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
there
was
free
to
throw
away.
here
the
--
while
outside
these
are
as
human
beings
and
the
householder
can't
change
the
channel
sort
of
speak.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
trespass
to
take
of
that,
aren't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
an
ordinance
like
this?
