justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
in
the
history
--
to
get
the
scope
of
the
--
the
ordinance
in
my
residence
or
dwelling,
would
that
include
a
dwelling
such
as
lake
point
towers
or
one
of
the
very
large
high-rise
apartment
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
are
in
chicago,
i
take
it,
some
large
buildings
that
include
even
supermarkets
and
--
and
various
kinds
of
stores
as
well
as
apartments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
--
there
--
there
you
could
have
customary
kinds
of
labor
disputes
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
by
other
than
housemaids.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
was
--
i
was
referring
to
a
building
that
contained
a
large
number
of
dwellings
such
as
an
apartment
building
and
also
contained
places
of
business.
this
ordinance
would
apply
to
that
--
that
structure
and
would
permit
labor
dispute
picketing
but
would
ban
all
other
picketing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
--
may
i
interrupt
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
comparison
between
this
case
and
--
and
mosley?
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
in
mosley,
you
had
schools
that
may
--
and
there
are
difference
between
just
on
the
kind
of
picketing.
whereas
here,
you
got
pure
homes
and
homes
that
are
partly
homes
and
partly
places
of
employment
and
it's
fair
to
distinguish
between
those
two.
but
isn't
there
still
another
problem
and
that
is
that
within
the
category
of
homes
which
are
also
places
of
employment,
you
have
some
picketing
that's
prohibited
and
yet
labor
picketing
is
permitted.
so
is
there
not
the
same
problem
that
you
had
in
mosley
if
you
just
focus
on
the
--
those
homes
that
are
also
places
of
employment.
that
the
picketing
as
to
those
draws
a
distinction
based
on
content.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
remember
the
case,
you
questioned
the
standing
of
these
litigants
to
challenge
the
distinction
as
between
different
kinds
of
picketing
in
a
place
that
is
used
for
employment.
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
making
the
same
argument
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
he
do
all
those
things
that
unless
he
has
non-union
janitors
that
--
and
there
--
and
the
union
doesn't
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
permissibility
that
picketing
depends
entirely
on
the
content
of
what
they're
saying.
if
they're
objecting
to
the
--
the
boss'
position
with
respect
to
the
butler,
it's
permissible
but
f
they're
objecting
to
his
position
on
bussing,
it's
prohibited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
make
that
argument,
don't
you
have
to
say
there's
a
greater
right
to
be
let
alone
at
home
than
there
is
at
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
think
in
my
question
went
to
the
equal
protection
point
to,
because
it's
in
the
area
of
--
as
i
understand
the
ordinance
of
dwellings
where
there
are
employees
that
should
get
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
described
where
one
picket
carrying
a
sign
this
--
it's
unfair
of
the
union
can
do
so
and
another
picket
saying
it's
unfair
not
to
bus
can
not
do
so.
and
i
was
trying
to
figure
and
think
through
the
scope
of
how
many
places
are
there
that
are
dwellings
of
that
category.
and
you
are
saying
if
--
if
i
understand
you
i
haven't
thought
if
that
before
that
any
dwelling
really
could
be
because
if
you
bring
a
plumber
in
his
presumably
a
member
of
the
union
and
he
does
some
work
there
and
while
he
is
there
i
guess
the
ordinance
applies
to
him
as
your
argument.
that
applies
to
that
residence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
of
--
of
course
in
any
apartment
house
where
they
have
janitors
and
people
who
--
who
keep
place
warm
and
electricians
and
all
would
be
covered
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
have
non-union
employees
and
the
union
wants
to
organize
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
true
that
the
statute
has
the
same
effect
on
peaceful
picketing
as
it
does
are
non-peaceful
picketing?
