mr.
arnolds,
what
we
--
that
your
advise
as
to
this,
i'm
going
to
quote
to
you
a
federal
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
“whoever,
with
the
intent
of
influencing
any
judge
pickets
in
or
near
a
residence
occupied
or
used
by
such
judge
shall
be”
--
and
so
forth.
if
you
prevail
here,
will
that
federal
statute
also
go
down
the
drain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
there
a
difference
between
influencing
an
injustice
and
influencing
legislation
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
may
that
the
organized
labor
who
is
pretty
in
influential
(inaudible)
when
the
statute
is
passed.
