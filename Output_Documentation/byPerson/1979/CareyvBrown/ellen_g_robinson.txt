ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
residential
picketing
case
and
appealed
to
this
court
from
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
like
the
fourth
amendment
case
announced
today
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
raises
important
questions
concerning
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
residential
privacy.
i'm
here
to
argue
on
behalf
of
the
illinois
residential
picketing
statute
which
prohibits
all
picketing
of
homes
which
are
used
only
as
places
of
residences,
but
it
allows
labor
dispute
picketing
of
houses
and
homes
which
also
function
as
a
place
or
the
location
of
an
employment
relationship.
the
narrow
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
i
would
say
that
is
does,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes.
in
fact,
i
would
say
that
the
labor
dispute
exception
is
focused
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
employment
relationship.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
well,
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
there
would
--
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
picketing
could
concern
the
employment
relationship
by
--
have
third
persons
concerning
the
employment
relationship
as
well
as
the
employee
him
or
herself.
the
narrow
question
in
this
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
the
--
the
statute
has
never
been
construed
by
any
state
court
and
the
state
courts
apparently
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
construe
the
statute
on
its
face
and
read
in
terms
of
common
understanding,
i
would
answer
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
of
course.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes
absolutely,
but
of
course,
the
statute
accepts
from
the
overall
ban
on
picketing
residences
which
are
used
as
places
of
business
and
that's
a
separate
exception
than
the
labor
dispute
exception,
so
any
common
place
of
business
can
have
any
kind
of
picketing.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
no,
i
don't
think
so.
if
understand
your
--
your
question
correctly,
the
statute
on
its
face
permits
all
picketing
of
buildings,
of
residences
which
are
used
as
places
of
business.
so
if
you
have
a
--
a
big
building
that
has
a
supermarket
on
the
ground
floor,
i
--
i
think
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
given
their
common
meaning
that
you
could
picket
it
without
reliance
on
the
labor
dispute
exception.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
i
think
you
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
of
course.
certainly,
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
we
assume
that
it
would
give
it
a
fairly
narrow
construction.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
question
in
this
appeal
is
a
very
narrow
one
and
that
is
whether
because
of
the
labor
dispute
exception
to
the
overall
prohibition
on
residential
picketing,
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
uncontroverted.
one,
the
plaintiffs
are
all
members
of
the
civil
rights
organization,
and
one
evening
in
1977
about
20
men,
members
of
this
organization
went
to
the
single
family
home
of
the
then
mayor
of
chicago
to
picket
his
house
to
protest
his
position
on
school
busing.
most
of
the
people
who
were
picketing
were
arrested
and
charged
with
violating
the
residential
picketing
statute.
they
were
--
they
pleaded
guilty
and
they
were
sentenced
to
periods
of
supervision.
when
the
periods
of
supervision
had
concluded,
they
filed
a
suit
in
federal
district
court
in
chicago
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
claiming
that
the
statute
violated
both
their
first
amendment
rights
and
their
equal
protection
rights.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
no,
they
did
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
collaterally
attack
their
former
state
court
conviction.
the
district
court
ruled
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
with
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
being
the
affidavits
of
the
plaintiffs
regarding
their
intentions
to
picket
in
the
future.
they
allege
that
they
wanted
in
the
future
to
picket
the
mayor
of
chicago
again
as
well
as
various
other
residences
in
chicago
neighborhoods.
the
district
court
upheld
the
statue
on
both
first
amendment
grounds
and
on
equal
protection
grounds.
the
plaintiff
appealed
and
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
without
reaching
the
first
amendment
issues
raised.
that
court
struck
the
statute
on
equal
protection
grounds.
the
seventh
circuit
was
impressed
by
the
similarities
between
the
residential
picketing
statute
and
the
school
picketing
statute
that
this
court
held
unconstitutional
in
mosley.
they
noted
that
each
statutes
were
--
was
--
contained
a
general
prohibition
of
picketing
in
a
certain
place
with
a
labor
dispute
exception.
and
because
of
these
similarities,
the
seventh
circuit
wrote
that
it
could
find
no
principle
basis
of
distinction
between
the
two
statutes.
we
appealed
because
we
think
that
there's
an
important
difference
between
a
statute
which
protects
quiet
classrooms
and
one
which
promotes
residential
privacy.
and
we
think
that
this
aspect
of
the
appeal
is
going
to
turn
on
the
critical
and
important
differences
between
homes
and
between
schools.
mosley
was
a
regulation
passed
by
the
city
of
chicago
to
protect
quiet
schools
and
it
prohibited
all
picketing
around
schools
when
schools
were
in
session
except
for
labor
dispute
picketing.
but
as
the
court
noted
in
its
opinion,
both
labor
picketing
and
non-labor
picketing
are
equally
disruptive
of
quiet
classrooms
and
the
state
couldn't
offer
any
good
reason
why
it
would
tolerate
one
kind
of
decept
--
deceptive
picketing
but
not
another.
because
of
this
arbitrary
choice,
the
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
on
equal
protection
grounds.
but
mosley
didn't
create
a
per
se
rule
against
every
labor
dispute
exception
in
a
picketing
statute.
it
--
in
fact
the
opinion
itself
specifically
sets
forth
the
circumstances
under
which
such
an
exception
would
be
constitutional
and
that
would
be
what
was
narrowly
tailored
and
reflected
an
important
state
interest
that
was
--
the
state
was
trying
to
further.
and
we
think
that
the
residential
picketing
statute
is
just
such
a
statute.
this
statute
protects
all
of
our
rights
to
be
let
alone
in
our
own
homes.
and
the
legislature
of
illinois
found
that
this
right
is
disrupted
when
people
picket
our
homes.
but
the
legislature
also
recognized
that
the
resident
doesn't
have
the
same
right
to
be
let
alone
in
his
own
home
by
a
stranger
who
invites
him
to
his
house
for
an
employment
relationship.
this
--
this
invitation
springing
in
of
a
stranger
dilutes
his
right
of
residential
privacy
as
to
that
stranger
and
it
also
creates
the
mere
act
of
forming
the
employment
relationship,
creates
rights
under
state
law
to
picket
the
place
of
employment
in
case
a
labor
dispute
arises.
because
these
two
factors
are
present,
the
dilution
and
the
creation
of
the
substantive
right
in
the
employee
to
picket,
it's
reasonable
to
let
the
residential
employee,
but
nobody
else
picket
a
home
which
is
also
a
place
of
employment.
and
in
contrast
then
to
the
labor
dispute
exception
in
the
mosley
ordinance
which
didn't
--
didn't
have
a
--
any
clear
reason.
in
fact,
there's
a
clear
reason
for
allowing
a
labor
dispute
exception
in
a
residential
picketing
statute
which
protects
residential
privacy.
we
think
that
the
reason
that
the
seventh
circuit
couldn't
find
a
basis
of
a
distinction
then
between
this
statute
and
the
mosley
ordinance
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
focused
on
the
conduct
or
the
picketing
that
was
being
prohibited,
instead
at
looking
at
the
interests
that
the
state
was
trying
to
protect.
now,
having
shown
what
the
differences
are
between
the
mosley
ordinance
and
the
residential
picketing
statute,
i
had
planned
to
talk
more
about
the
right
of
residential
privacy
and
about
the
judgments
about
that
right
that
the
illinois
legislature
made
in
the
statute.
in
light
of
the
appeal
--
the
new
york
fourth
amendment
opinions
announced
today,
i
don't
think
that
all
elaborate
on
residential
privacy
too
much
but
i
will
note
that
the
court
has
been
no
less
solicitous
of
this
interest
of
being
let
alone
in
our
own
homes
in
first
amendment
cases
than
it
was
today
in
fourth
amendment
case.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
well,
the
--
the
conduct
--
as
to
the
aspect
of
the
conduct
which
is
being
prohibited,
yes,
sir,
it's
a
direct
correlation
between
our
statute
and
the
mosley
ordinance.
our
--
our
point
is
that
because
the
interest
which
are
being
protected
are
so
different
and
so
differently
affected
by
the
two
kinds
of
picketing
that
we
have
--
being
prohibited
that
this
statute
is
distinguishable
from
mosley.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
right.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
right.
the
reason
is
basically
because
illinois
has
always
--
is
being
zealous
to
protect
the
rights
of
people
to
be
let
alone
in
their
homes
while
at
the
same
time
being
careful
to
--
to
not
unfairly
limit
the
rights
of
employees
to
picket
their
place
of
employment
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
well,
that
would
leave
open
the
traditional
first
amendment
question
which
is
irrespective
of
the
distinction
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
you
could.
we
would
urge
you
not
to
remand.
the
issue
is
fully
briefed.
there
was
a
full
opinion
by
the
district
court.
the
questions
are
so
closely
intertwined
and
both
the
first
amendment
and
equal
protection
question
both
require
an
inquiry
into
the
scope
and
the
nature
of
residential
privacy
which
is
before
the
court.
so
we
would
urge
you
to
--
also
to
consider
the
broad
first
amendment
question
raised.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
please.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
we
--
we
don't
make
that
argument
to
this
court.
we
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
statute
regulates
--
doesn't
regulate
a
place
as
in
the
sense
of
the
geographical
â€“
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
--
location,
but
merely
a
home
with
two
different
functions.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
if
i
--
if
i
may
go
outside
the
record
a
little
bit,
your
honor,
in
illinois,
there's
no
legislative
history
of
this
kind
of
statute
but
there
is
a
--
a
report
about
it
and
the
--
the
--
according
to
the
report,
the
thought
was
that
this
would
allow
some
tenants
to
picket
the
place
where
they
lived
in
order
to
protest
the
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
--
terrible
conditions,
right.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
but
the
labor
dispute
could
exist
even
if
the
employee
wasn't
part
of
the
dispute.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
condominium
that
employees
non-union
janitors
and
the
--
non-janitors
perfectly
happy
to
be
there,
conceivably
union
janitors
could
engage
in
picketing
very
much
like
the
traditional
labor
--
labor
law
case.
just
briefly
to
note
the
cases,
the
two
cases
which
we
feel
are
the
most
important
in
the
first
--
regarding
first
amendment
rights
and
residential
privacy,
i
would
suggest
that
both
roane
and
--
the
roane
case
and
fcc
versus
pacifica
foundation,
are
the
most
important
cases
for
a
--
for
establishing
the
power
of
states
to
protect
people's
rights
to
be
let
alone
in
their
homes
as
against
unwarranted
and
uninvited
intrusions.
in
roane,
a
post
office
regulation
which
allowed
the
post
office
not
to
deliver
mail
which
a
homeowner
found
intrusive
or
in
fact
offensive
was
upheld.
and
in
pacifica
foundation,
the
fcc's
censure
of
a
broadcast
of
a
comedian's
offensive
monologue
was
upheld.
the
appellees
would
suggest
that
these
are
really
just
dirty
words
cases,
but
we
think
that
these
cases
turned
on
the
fact
that
one
of
the
targets
of
the
communications
with
people
in
their
homes
and
that
the
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
government
has
special
power
to
protect
people
when
they're
in
their
homes.
after
all,
both
the
communications
in
roane
and
pacifica
foundation
would've
been
fully
protected
if
they
had
been
broadcast
to
a
person
on
the
street
or
in
some
other
public
place.
there's
a
suggestion
by
the
appellees
that
picketing
may
not
be
disruptive
of
residential
privacy.
well,
the
illinois
legislature
found
that
it
was
and
the
district
court
agreed
that
this
finding
was
a
reasonable
finding.
and
we
think
surely
that
if
under
roane,
a
piece
of
mail
which
could
be
easily
thrown
away
and
under
pacifica
foundation,
a
radio
broadcast
which
could
be
simply
turned
off,
were
found
sufficiently
disruptive
of
our
rights
to
be
let
alone,
then
clearly,
a
picket
or
patrolling
at
our
front
doorstep
should
be
sufficiently
disruptive
to
sustain
state
regulation.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
we,
on
--
on
its
face,
it
would
your
honor
and
it's
--
and
i
repeat
only
that
the
statute
has
not
been
construed
by
the
state
courts.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
on
its
face,
it
appears
to,
on
its
face.
i
would
suggest
of
course
that
we
don't
have
a
picketing
with
nobody
in
the
house
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
have
20
people
picketing
a
home
and
as
to
--
in
the
pleadings,
there's
no
allegations
whether
the
mayor
and
his
wife
and
a
baby
were
at
home
or
not.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
they
could.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
that
would've
been
my
point.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that
would've
been
one
way
to
handle
the
case.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
on
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
on
its
face.
on
its
face,
it
would,
your
honor.
we
would
submit,
your
honor
that
this
would
not
be
a
proper
case
given
the
pleadings
as
they
exist
to
strike
this
ordinance
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face
under
the
first
amendment.
as
it
might
hypothetically
be
applied
to
the
conduct,
you
have
suggested
in
many,
many
other
ideas
that
the
appellees
raise
in
their
briefs.
we
have
here
a
statute
which
protects
conduct
and
--
i
mean
what
regulates
conduct
and
not
merely
pure
speech.
we
have
a
statute
that
is
clearly
susceptible
to
a
narrow
state
constitution
--
construction
and
we
have
here
plaintiffs
who
when
they
had
the
opportunity
to
seek
in
narrowing
construction
from
the
state
court,
voluntarily
forwent
that
opportunity
in
order
to
plead
guilty
to
escape
what
might
have
been
a
more
harsh
sentence.
so
i
would
urge
that
the
--
that
the
question
only
be
--
the
first
amendment
question
only
be
as
applied
to
the
plaintiffs
that
the
--
to
the
conduct
that
the
plaintiffs
actually
engaged
in,
and
that's
in
the
record.
as
to
the
traditional
first
amendment
question
which
i
was
asked
about,
the
issue
of
course
would
be
whether
irrespective
above
the
distinction
between
labor
and
non-labor
picketing,
illinois
can
prohibit
picketing
at
a
home
and
we
know
of
course
that
the
state
can
regulate
picketing
on
sidewalks
where
that
conduct
is
inconsistent
with
the
use
of
the
surrounding
areas
and
that
the
case
would
resolve
into
a
very
traditional
balancing
between
the
rights
of
the
picketers
and
the
rights
of
the
homeowners.
and
we
think
that
the
key
in
this
case
to
that
balancing
would
be
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
picketers
here
have
alternative
places
where
they
could've
picketed
the
mayor.
they
could've
picketed
him
at
the
city
hall
or
at
any
of
the
other
public
places
that
he
went
to
in
the
course
of
performing
his
official
duties.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
it
did.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that
--
that
case
concerned
a
merge
around
a
four-square
block
area
in
the
mayor's
neighborhood
and
the
holding
of
the
court
was,
was
that
the
--
mr.
gregory
and
his
--
and
his
group
had
been
arrested
and
charged
for
disorderly
conduct
and
the
holding
was
that
the
facts
as
presented
to
the
trial
court,
did
not
support
a
disorderly
conduct.
and
we
think
that
that's
a
very
important
case
because
of
mr.
justice
black
and
douglas'
concurrence
where
it
invites
states
to
pass
ordi
--
ordinances
just
like
the
regulation
that
illinois
has
passed
here
to
protect
the
rights
of
people
to
be
let
alone
in
their
homes
and
free
from
picketers
who
would
interrupt
their
--
their
privacy.
so
the
picketers
here
have
different
places
where
they
can
picket
and
if
they
nevertheless
want
to
insist
on
their
right
to
communicate
with
people
when
they're
on
--
in
their
own
homes,
there's
other
and
less
at
--
lessened
intrusive
ways
they
can
do
it.
they
could
do
door
to
door
solicitation,
they
could
write
letters,
they
could
have
phone
calls,
they
could
call
--
call
at
their
homes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
i
--
i
suppose
that
they
could.
that
of
course
would
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
raise
--
[attempt
to

right
and
each
of
those
methods
would
be
far
more
preferable
than
picketing
because
the
resident
can
control
each
of
those
messages.
he
can
throw
away
mail
that
he
doesn't
want
and
hang
up
on
a
phone
call
or
--
and
he
can
post
a
sign
to
deter
door
to
door
solicitation
like
the
court
invited
the
residents
to
do
in
the
stromberg
case
which
it
recently
decided.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
to
that
extent
though,
your
honor,
the
resident
has
waived
his
right
to
be
entirely
let
alone
by
these
employees
and
people
who
want
to
communicate
with
or
about
the
employees
to
the
extent
that
he
is
knowingly
and
voluntarily
lived
in
a
place
or
created
an
employment
relationship
within
his
own
home.
if
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
i
think
on
its
face,
if
the
19
were
picketing
in
support
of
the
one
employee,
that
the
statute
that
would
apply
to
allow
the
picketing
of
the
entire
group.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes.
as
to
your
second
hypothetical,
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
as
long
as
they
were
all
picketing
about
the
labor
dispute
and
the
labor
relationship
which
was
at
the
situs
of
the
home,
which
was
situs
at
the
home.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
throughout
this
litigation,
all
the
courts
and
all
the
parties
have
treated
this
to
mean
the
same
as
the
mosley
ordinance,
mean
which
â€“
is
that
it
only
allows
labor
dispute
picketing.
as
according
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
thank
you
for
clarifying
that.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that's
correct
and
we
--
and
of
course
our
position
again
is
that
that
kind
of
content
regulation
is
perfectly
permissible
under
mosley
because
of
the
nature
of
the
state
interest,
his
residential
privacy
right
which
is
diluted
as
well
as
--
which
is
being
protected
as
well
as
the
employees'
rights
to
picket
at
the
place
of
the
employment
relationship
if
he
gets
into
a
dispute.
it's
--
it's
really
just
a
perfect
example
like
in
the
tree
fruits
kind
of
situation
in
pure
labor
picketing
cases
of
the
state
trying
to
protect
two
interests
at
the
same
time,
a
resident's
right
to
be
let
alone
and
the
employee's
right
to
picket
his
place
of
employment
when
he
gets
into
a
dispute
and
--
and
our
assertion
is
--
is
that
this
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
balance
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
struck.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
not
greater
in
the
sense
of
volume
but
different
in
the
sense
that
--
first
of
all,
every
school
is
a
place
of
employment.
so
the
interest
in
residence
--
in
a
quiet
classrooms
is
not
in
anyway
affected
by
creating
or
not
creating
an
employment
relationship
in
the
school,
it's
there,
but
the
only
homes
which
are
--
are
those
in
which
the
resident
has
voluntarily
brought
a
stranger
into
his
home
for
the
employment
relationship.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
just
a
couple
of
points.
at
the
out
set
i'm
concerned
the
--
about
the
characterization
that
we've
conceded
the
20
people
picketing
in
front
a
home
at
6
o'clock
was
peaceful.
it's
not
in
the
record
whether
or
not
that
particular
picket
was
peaceful
or
not.
we
have
only
conceded
that
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
they
intended
to
engage
in
future
peaceful
picketing
if
the
statute
were
held
unconstitutional.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
on
it's
face
it
does
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
on
it's
face
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
well
--
well
i
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
but
i'm
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
i
don't
that
would
be
picketing
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
would
be
a
march
like
we
had
in
the
gregory
case
and
i
think
that
the
illinois
courts
in
light
of
their
other
decisions
regarding
picketing
would
construe
picketing
to
mean
patrolling
back
and
forth
in
front
of
a
single
limited
geographical
area.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
when
it
says,
--
i
think
the
statute
hasn't
been
construed
on
it's
face
and
in
light
illinois'
other
decisions
regarding
picketing.
i
think
--
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
i
think
that
the
courts
would
construe
it
to
mean
in
front
of
a
residence
just
the
way
picketers
and
this
case
were
picketing
right
in
front
of
the
mayor's
house.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
certainly
within
that
yes.
the
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
exactly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
illinois
has
the
special
statute
which
protects
labor
picketing
at
the
situs
of
on
employ
--
of
a
employment
relationship.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
not
in
this
case.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes,
it
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
of
course
that's
--
that's
the
contention
of
the
appellees
in
the
case,
they
said
that,
if
we
weave
the
right
of
residential
privacy
when
we
invite
an
employee
then
we
should
weave
it
as
to
everybody
else
who
comes
in.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
and
my
answer
to
that
is
it
--
it's
only
the
employees
and
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
picket
that
illinois
has
given
special
legislative
protection
to
and
the
separate
disting
--
statute
to
labor
anti
injunction
of
our
labor
dispute
picketing
statute
which
i
set
forth
in
my
brief.
and
because
of
the
special
protection
that
illinois
has
always
given
to
employees
to
picket
at
their
--
their
place
of
employment
in
case
a
labor
dispute
arises,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
illinois
legislature
when
they
were
deciding
to
protect
residential
privacy
to
also
simultaneously
protect
the
employee
picketing.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
yes
sir,
and
then
the
other
working
person
who
has
to
help
in
the
house.
ms.
ellen
g.
robinson
that
may
have
been
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
my
time
is
up.
