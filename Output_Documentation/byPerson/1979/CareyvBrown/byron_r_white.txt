justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
say
that
if
there
are
two
pickets
in
front
of
a
--
of
a
house
that's
partly
a
place
of
employment,
one
of
the
pickets
is
a
non-labor
picket
and
one
is
a
labor
picket
that
the
ordinance
is
perfectly
valid
--
would
be
perfectly
--
you
may
arrest
the
one
but
not
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
that's
a
--
that
you
think
that
a
rationale
or
subject
--
that
you've
got
a
good
enough
reason
for
distinguishing
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
pickets
to
sustain
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
equal
protection
ground,
what
do
we
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
will
--
what
will
we
do,
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
a
--
did
you
find
the
word
compelling
in
mosley?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
what
is
this,
what
do
you
think
the
mosley
standard
is
for
justification?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
think
--
do
think
mosley
said
it
is
never
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
deny
that
--
that
the
state
has
some
extra
--
some
additional
reason
for
permitting
labor
picketing
than
other
kinds
of
picketing.
at
least
there
is
a
reason
but
you
are
â€“
you
are
suggesting
it
just
is
inadequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now,
i
take
that
the
--
i
take
it
would
just
it
--
it
would
prevent
--
just
marching
with
signs
in
any
residential
neighborhood?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
that's
what
we
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
the
picketing
just
doesn't
mean
to
stopping
--
picking
out
a
target
on
it's
face
--
i
suppose
that
--
if
they
just
march
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
how
many
people
march
in
up
and
down
a
mile,
they
just
--
they
just
made
a
circuit
of
the
mile
in
the
residential
neighborhood.
they
didn't
have
any
by
name
they
just
--
just
election
hearings
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
the
--
a
block,
about
a
block?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
say
that
--
say
the
--
say
the
--
say
that
county
political
chairman
that
that
--
and
you
just
want
to
support
with
your
candidate,
so
you
--
you
had
a
sign
and
you
march
up
down
in
front
of
his
house
saying
support
so
and
so
for
sheriff,
that's
certainly
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
county
chairman
not
only
was
is
in
his
house
but
he
had
his
district
captains,
they
were
having
a
meeting
at
his
house
and
so
they
--
three
or
four
pickets
for
the
signs
they
support
so
and
so
for
sheriff,
that
would
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
--
even
though
he
is
certainly
has
invited
a
lot
of
people
into
his
house
that
might
--
that
that
--
and
he
might
perhaps
shouldn't
expect
the
same
kind
of
privacy
as
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
what's
your
answer
to
that
(voice
