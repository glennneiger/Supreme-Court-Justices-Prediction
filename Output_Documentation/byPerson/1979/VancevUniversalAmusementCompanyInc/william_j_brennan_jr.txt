justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
an
issue
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because,
in
effect,
you
do
not
question
the
holding
that
it
is
unconstitutional;
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
sense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
more
confused
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
are
presenting
your
case
here,
and
i
just
wonder
what
case
you
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
part
of
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
am
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
far
as
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
is
whether
the
injunction
has
been
broken.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
that
respect,
if
no
other,
it
differs
from
a
criminal
trial,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
it
is
civil.
but
i
cannot
tell
precisely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
postulate
--
the
reason
i
said
what
i
did
is
because
the
burden
of
proof
has
changed
in
texas
in
the
commitment
of
the
mentally
persons
and
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
involved
here,
but.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
send
him
to
jail
until
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
suggest
that
texas
is
convicting
people
of
criminal
contempt
for
a
certain
term
in
jail
on
proof
less
than
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
didn't;
he
said
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
civil
or
criminal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
after
a
determination
that
you
have
violated
the
injunction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
the
order
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
agree,
mr.
graves,
before
you
sit
down,
that
article
4666
is
not
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
texas
statute,
even
disregarding
4666,
with
a
finding
of
habitual
abuse
and
the
declaration
of
public
nuisance
under
4667,
in
your
view
would
the
trial
court
have
the
authority
as
a
matter
of
discretion
to
say
the
proper
remedy
here
is
to
close
the
theater?
