justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
the
one
involving
the
juvenile
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wasn't
decided
on
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
pullman
abstention,
but
it
was
not
applied
in
moore
v.
simms.
that
is
not
argued
in
this
case,
i
as
understand
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
is
discussed
in
moore
v.
simms.
i
did
not
recall
it
as
being
the
main
focus
of
the
thing,
although
i
am
sure
it
is
cited
in
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
like
civil
contempt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
in
effect,
hold
the
key
to
the
jailhouse
door
in
your
pocket.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
someone
is
convicted
for
second
degree
murder
in
texas
and
let's
assume
the
statute
permits
the
imposition
by
the
jury
of
20
years.
now,
does
the
standard
of
proof
for
conviction
of
a
clearly
defined
crime
in
texas
require
that
it
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
say
i
have
sent
for
moore
v.
simms,
and
i
was
too
critical
of
your
analysis
of
it.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
reference
in
it
to
the
pullman
abstention
doctrine.
and
i
think
i
owe
my
apology
to
you
for
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
this
a
prior
restraint?
is
it
your
contention
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
or
the
passage
of
the
statute
is
a
prior
restraint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
isn't
the
obscenity
law
then
of
prior
restraint
rather
than
the
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
criminal
laws.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
nuisance
route
that
has
been
occasionally
referred
to
in
opinions
of
this
court
is
then
actually
a
worse
one
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
than
an
outright
criminal
prosecution
under
an
obscenity
statue,
since
the
defendant
in
the
nuisance
route
doesn't
have
the
safeguards
of
the
criminal
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
following
the
heller
approach
that
this
court
decided
along
with
miller
case,
a
law
enforcement
officer
goes,
views
a
film,
files
an
affidavit,
presents
it
to
a
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
issues
a
search
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
the
--
of
one
copy
of
the
film.
the
law
enforcement
officer
goes
on
and
tries
to
seize
one
copy
of
the
film
and
the
owner
of
the
film
says
i
am
simply
not
going
to
turn
it
over
to
you,
i
am
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
do
you
think
he
can't
be
tried
for
contempt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
he
stood
in
the
door
and
said,
you
are
not
coming
in
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
something
looking
over
your
shoulder
under
a
perfectly
valid
statute,
under
paris
adult
theater
in
miller,
depending
upon
whether
a
jury
were
to
define
whether
or
not
it
met
the
test
laid
down
by
that
statute,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
proprietor
of
an
adult
film
theater
which
shows
sexually
explicit
film?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
really
don't
know
that
as
to
a
kind
of
any
particular
case,
except
to
say
that
when
you
have
a
criminal
obscenity
statute
the
proprietor
in
an
adult
film
theater
does
have
to
use
some
judgment
in
interpreting
that
law,
at
least
consult
his
lawyer.
