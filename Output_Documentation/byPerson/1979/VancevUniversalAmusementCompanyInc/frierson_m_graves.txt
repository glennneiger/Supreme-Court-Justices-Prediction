mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
zwiener
mentions
prior
restraint.
i
would
like
to
state
to
the
court
some
reasons
why
i
believe
this
statute
shows
that
it
is
an
impermissible
prior
restraint.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
against
unnamed
future
films
which
subject
the
motion
picture
operator
or
otherwise
to
the
various
types
of
either
somebody
looking
over
his
shoulders,
the
judge
acting
as
the
censor,
the
unlimited
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
in
issuing
that
injunction,
the
broad
language
that
is
permissible
in
the
injunction,
it
is
doing
for
the
future
what
near
v.
minnesota
applied
to
a
newspaper
say
shouldn't
be
done.
and
now
they
are
attempting
to
expand
that
to
say
because
there
has
been
shown
an
obscene
motion
picture
and
we
come
in
and
get
a
single
judge
on
a
preponderance
of
the
proof
to
issue
an
injunction
and
the
judge
therefore
sets
out
the
broad
language
of
what
he
might
consider
to
be
obscene
in
the
future,
that
it
becomes
a
prior
restraint
because
we
have
that
facing
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
the
first
amendment
field,
because
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
the
--
the
only
limited
exception
that
i
believe
this
court
has
really
looked
at
is
the
model
statute
in
kingsley
books
v.
brown
in
which
there
was
a
movie
brought
before
--
or
a
book
brought
before
the
court.
that
particular
book
was
enjoined
and
then
if
there
was
any
violation
in
the
future,
then
the
person
could
be
punished.
and
even
in
that
decision
the
court
said,
well,
it
is
possible
that
even
while
we
are
waiting
to
try
the
obscenity
finally
on
the
merits,
new
york
might
not
even
punish
for
contempt
if
they
continued
the
sale
of
the
book
during
that
period
of
time.
but
to
extend
this
doctrine
--
and
i
know
the
court
has
said
maybe
the
best
possible
notice
of
whether
or
not
a
motion
picture
is
obscene
would
be
to
have
a
civil
injunction
against
it
and
then
if
there
was
a
further
exhibition
of
the
motion
picture
you
would
know
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
the
particular
motion
picture,
just
like
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right,
sir,
because
in
this
case
you
have
the
judge
says
in
his
unlimited
discretion.
and
in
the
case
that
the
state
cites
of
richards
v.
state,
the
court
there
says
it
was
unwilling
to
assume
that
the
state
must
bring
suit
each
time
the
defendants
change
the
obscene
menu
in
their
passion
pits.
and
that
they
didn't
want
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
chancellor.
well,
in
this
particular
case
the
broad
language,
the
case
that
the
state
of
texas
cites
as
the
good
example
of
what
the
specific
conduct
should
be,
they
mentioned
they
shouldn't
have.
what
is
defined
in
the
code
is
sexual
intercourse,
deviate
sexual
intercourse
or
bestiality,
and
then
the
injunction
says
or
you
are
permanently
enjoined
from
showing
any
motion
pictures
or
magazines
or
selling
those
or
other
materials
which
contain
representations
or
descriptions
of
ultimate
sex
acts,
normal
or
perverted,
actual
or
simulated.
so
you
have
an
injunction
that
the
court
says
that
you
have
a
description
in
the
book
of
a
simulated
sex
acts
or
if
you
have
a
description
or
depiction
in
a
movie,
then
if
it
violates
the
term
of
the
obscenity
law
you
can
be
punished
for
contempt
of
court.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
the
obscenity
law
faces
everyone
who
may
or
may
not
want
to
distribute.
but
when
you
have
an
injunction
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
criminal
law.
but
when
you
have
an
injunction
that
says
not
only
will
we
determine
whether
you
have
violated
the
injunction
but
we
will
also
subject
you
to
six
months
in
jail,
which
is
the
penalty
in
texas
for
criminal
contempt,
that
is
it.
but
you
don't
have
what
you
are
entitled
to
in
a
criminal
trial.
it
hasn't
gone
through
the
hands
of
a
criminal
complaint,
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
all
your
protection
that
you
have,
and
what
you
have
in
this
statute
which
is
beyond
the
criminal,
is
that
this
statute
allows
a
private
individual
without
injury
to
bring
the
suit
for
injunction.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that
for
a
civil
injunction
against
the
showing
of
a
particular
movie
in
existence
which
is
brought
before
the
court
and
there
is
no
dissent
or
hearing
on
that
movie
and
if
there
is
an
injunction
on
it,
then
only
in
the
future
if
you
disobey
that
injunction
by
showing
that
particular
movie.
but
when
you
have
here
an
injunction
that
says
just
as
the
criminal
statute,
if
you
happen
to
show
any
particular
material
that
has
a
simulated
setback
in
it,
you
can
be
brought
back
before
the
court
for
a
contempt
action,
then
that
is
going
beyond
what
is
the
limited
exception
that
you
have
looked
at
for
civil
injunctions
in
kingsley
books
v.
brown
or
the
other
model.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
this
is
against
unidentified,
unnamed
films
that
--
or
magazines
or
books
that
are
not
even
in
existence.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
not
necessarily
so,
sir.
and
i
say
this
because
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
you
would
have
if
they
were
trying
the
movie
but
you
could
also
be
convicted
of
contempt
if
you
failed
to
produce
the
movie
--
if
the
court
said,
i
issue
a
show
cause
order,
you
are
arrested,
under
procedures
admissible
in
texas
you
are
arrested,
and
not
just
a
citation
for
show
cause,
you
are
put
in
jail,
you
are
brought
into
court
and
you
fail
to
produce
the
motion
picture.
and
the
court
says,
bring
in
the
motion
picture
in
the
court
because
i
want
to
see
it
and
rule
whether
or
not
you
are
in
contempt.
and
you
say,
i
am
not
going
to
bring
the
motion
picture.
you
have
violated
the
injunction.
you
may
have
been
served
with
the
injunction
and
you
don't
take
the
film
off
of
the
screen
right
then
and
there.
you
might
be
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
you
would
have
to
be,
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
all
the
procedures
you
would
be
if
you
were
a
criminal
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
but
the
real
problem
with
that
is
you
ignore
that
an
injunction
action
could
be
brought
before
a
single
judge,
that
the
district
attorney,
the
city
attorney,
the
county
attorney
picks
out,
that
judge
says,
and
he
writes
a
very
broad
injunction
and
so
a
7-11
store
or
a
department
store,
the
people
that
the
book
sellers
association
here,
they
say,
we
are
not
going
to
take
that
book
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
--
and
display
it
any
more.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
from
the
injunction
in
the
state
v.
stambaugh.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
in
the
richards
case
and
in
the
locke
case
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
you
are
right,
sir,
because
the
state
of
texas,
while
they
did,
the
injunction
says
though,
taken
as
a
whole,
but
the
locke
v.
state
and
the
richards
case
says
to
state
that
sexual
intercourse
and
offend,
that
is
obviously
obscene.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
even
though
it
is
an
isolated
incident.
and,
your
honor,
that
is
the
problem,
that
it
can
go
beyond
to
do
this,
the
fact
of
what
is
done.
there
is
an
appeal
now
in
the
fifth
circuit
of
a
civil
injunction
against
an
issue
of
penthouse
magazine.
you
will
find
that
when
a
private
citizen
can
bring
an
injunction
suit
to
get
to
say
that
this
particular
magazine
is
obscene,
find
a
judge
that
can
do
it,
there
is
a
broad
general
injunction
for
every
unnamed
future
publication.
and
petition
after
petition
can
be
brought
and
it
will
get
the
courts
into
what
this
court
didn't
want
to
be,
as
a
nation-wide
censor,
in
that
judge
becomes
just
like
the
administrative
censor.
in
fact,
in
the
locke
v.
state
case,
where
there
was
another
problem,
which
was
an
agreed
order
of
procedure
and
the
agreed
order
of
procedure
was
that
if
a
motel
operator
had
a
film
that
he
wanted
to
show
and
thought
it
was
a
borderline,
he
would
take
it
down
to
the
court
and
ask
for
a
ruling,
or
risk
contempt.
and
when
you
have
got
that,
then
the
judge
could
be
faced
with
magazines,
motion
picture
films,
books,
anything
like
that.
and
we
are
not
talking
about
just
explicit
sexual
movies,
we
are
--
you
might
even
be
re-litigating
lady
chatterly's
lover,
because
that
has
descriptions
of
it,
as
opposed
to
that,
while
that
might
have
serious
value,
you
would
say,
well,
something
that
goes
along
with
the
happy
hooker,
then
that
has
the
description
of
it
and
some
bookstore
says,
i
don't
want
to
do
that
because
i
may
be
facing
an
original
injunction.
and
then
i
have
the
duty
to
look
into
each
and
every
book
that
i
want.
now,
we
always
know
that
there
are
some
people
that
are
going
to
take
the
chance
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
caught,
they
are
not
going
to
be
prosecuted,
they
are
not
otherwise
do
it,
and
they
are
going
to
take
that
chance
under
the
criminal
law.
and
when
we
have
always
thought
that
in
the
first
amendment
that
it
is
either
that
--
in
crimes
that
you
look
at
both
either
punishment
or
education
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
would
do
this.
and
that
the
first
amendment
you
are
entitled
to
a
broad
protection
on
prior
restraint.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it,
to
stop
it.
let
the
man
have
the
subsequent
punishment.
now,
this
contempt
action
is
not
just
subsequent
punishment.
not
only
don't
you
have
all
of
the
things
of
criminal
procedures,
but
you
can
say
a
petition
is
brought
that
a
man
showed
the
motion
picture
a
month
ago
and
now
he
is
charged
with
contempt.
it
is
ridiculous
to
say
that
every
action
will
always
be
civil
contempt,
and
i
have
the
keys
to
the
jail
because
i
stopped
showing
the
motion
picture.
it
has
been
shown
a
month
ago.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
think
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
court
of
failing
to
"the
first
thing
i
think
the
officer
would
just
go
in
and
physically
take
the
film
because
he
had
been
authorized
to."
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
would
be
arrested
and
physically
taken
away
and
they
would
go
take
the
film
on
the
basis
of
the
search
warrant.
but
in
this
case,
if
you
approach
it
under
the
civil
injunction
statue,
that
i
have
an
injunction
against
me
and
you
if
you
go
out
to
show
me
a
show
cause
order,
under
heller,
i
continue
even
with
the
criminal
charge
to
show
the
motion
picture
because
i
believe
the
jury
will
find
me
not
guilty.
under
this
case,
if
i
continue
to
show
the
motion
picture
the
judge
can
say,
i
told
you,
you
are
under
an
injunction
and
you
are
both
civil
and
criminal
because
it
is
past
actions
of
showing
it
and
in
the
future
you
can't
show
this
unnamed
picture
now
identified
any
more.
so
you
have
gone
even
beyond
heller
by
saying
not
only
you
seize
the
film
but
you
have
that
particular
injunction.
i
just
believe
that
when
we
are
talking
about
the
first
amendment
and
the
idea
that
the
first
amendment's
chief
purpose
is
to
not
have
a
prior
restraint
and
that
you
would
try
to
say
that
you
wouldn't,
that
the
least
tolerated
and
the
most
serious
type
of
provision
under
the
first
amendment
is
to
try
to
identify
this
in
the
past.
the
contempt,
the
injunction,
becomes
just
the
same
thing
as
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
sitting
there
but
you
have
that
official
sanction
of
someone
looking
over
your
particular
shoulder
every
time,
with
that
particular
judge
being
a
censor,
for
something
that
is
so
loose
in
identification,
because
we
still
have
in
smith
v.
u.s.,
we
still
said
it
was
a
real
fact
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
material
appealed
to
the
purient
interest
or
was
faintly
offensive
according
to
contemporary
standards
of
the
community.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
you
have
the
normal
checks
and
balance
of
a
government
as
to
whether
or
not
there
will
be
a
criminal
indictment
or
a
possible
grand
jury
hearing
on
it,
because
there
are
other
criminal
procedures
to
you,
as
opposed
to
the
fact
that
just
like
in
mckinney
v.
alabama
some
people
won't
want
to
challenge
the
fact
when
they
have
an
injunction,
whereas
if
they
are
distributing
a
magazine
or
a
book
or
a
motion
picture
which
has
some
isolated
incident
of
sex
act
in
it,
are
they
going
to
say
that
this
freezes,
it
doesn't
just
chill,
it
freezes
the
provisions
and
becomes
what
i
believe
is
an
impermissible
prior
restraint
in
that
action,
sir.
the
contempt
action,
this
also
is
really
self-censorship,
because
the
person
must
look
at
each
and
everything
when
he
is
under
an
injunction.
in
a
criminal
prosecution
if
a
bookstore
operator
receives
a
book,
a
written
book,
and
he
doesn't
read
it
completely
and
he
is
not
in
the
adult
business
where
he
screens
these
--
he
is
in
a
zoned
area
like
american
mini-theater
v.
young,
but
he
is
having
it
there,
he
has
had
an
injunction
issued
against
him.
does
he
review
each
and
every
book
and
then
make
that
determination
himself
as
to
what
must
be
done
when
he
is
not
he
is
on
the
borderline.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
involved
the
original
case,
universal
theater
amusements
v.
vance-involved
deep
throat.
it
was
tried
twice
in
houston,
texas,
there
mis-trials
both
times.
when
we
were
having
the
hearing
in
this
case
the
prosecution
dismissed
the
indictment
against
deep
throat,
and
that
case
was
settled
and
leaving
these
other
pending
20
cases.
so
we
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
but
he
also
has
the
very
uneven
application
of
the
law,
become
some
juries
determine
that
it
is
not
obscene
and
some
juries
decide
that
particular
films
with
explicit
sex
acts
are
obscene.
and
that
has
to
be
that
particular
person'
judgment
as
to
whether
he
goes
over
the
borderline
with
a
determinate
as
opposed
to
the
time
when
you
have
an
injunction
here
that
goes
back
before
a
single
judge
that
says,
in
my
mind,
any
act,
any
motion
picture
which
shows
a
sex
act,
actual,
or
simulated,
i
also
believe
appeals
to
the
prurient
interests
and
you
are
convicted
of
contempt,
or
you
are
guilty
of
civil
contempt
for
this
unknown
motion
picture
that
you
have
now
presented.
and
it
is
the
main
reason,
it
is
the
unnamed
future
publication
in
which
there
is
that
restraint
upon
the
individual.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
the
state
of
tennessee
there
was.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
in
texas,
i
don't
believe
in
texas
--
of
course
this
statute
was
passed
in
'74
and
there
were
some
proceedings
pending
at
that
time,
so
that
this
became
involved
in
the
declaratory
relief
at
that
time
in
there.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
other
injunctions,
such
as
in
dallas
in
austin,
texas,
but
i
don't
know
if
there
have
been
any
contempt
proceedings
involved
in
this.
but
i
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
think
it
is
both,
sir.
i
think
it
is
both,
because
if
you
--
in
the
first
place
if
you
have
the
magazine
or
if
you
have
the
motion
picture
at
the
time,
then
the
court
is
going
to
say,
stop
showing
it
or
you
are
in
civil
contempt,
stay
in
jail
until
you
do
stop
showing
it.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
the
general
injunction,
but
if
you
are
cited
for
contempt
because
you
show
a
picture
like
it
in
the
future,
and
you
still
had
the
picture,
it
would
be
civil
contempt
and
you
are
going
to
stay
in
jail
until
you
stop
showing
it.
or
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
only
after
a
determination
that
you
have
violated
the
injunction
except,
your
honor,
you
are
not
going
to
come
--
you
are
not
going
to
be
filed
with
a
show
cause
order
and
immediately
come
into
court.
you
are
going
to
have
a
few
days
to
prepare.
and
if
you
continue
to
show
at
that
time,
then
you
then
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
temporary
injunction
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
case
as
i
read
in
texas,
your
honor,
and
the
ones
i
cited
is
our
brief,
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
criminal
part,
but
in
the
civil
part
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
like
any
other
civil
contempt,
yes,
sir.
now,
they
do
have
divorce
hearings
wherein
they
say
we
are
giving
you
criminal
contempt
and
put
you
in
jail,
but
i
would
think
that
if
you
had
somebody
obnoxious
odors
or
running
a
house
of
prostitution
or
liquor,
then
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir,
the
punishment
is
six
months.
and
so
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
am
not
--
i
don't
generally
practice
in
texas,
so
i
can't
answer.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
agree
that
the
court
down
there
said
that
it
wasn't
involved
but,
if
it
was,
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
since
it
was
conceded
in
the
brief,
i
did
not
raise
that
issue.
i
know
it
was
brought
up
by
the
amicus
but
i
think
it
so
clearly
unconstitutional
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
court.
thank
you.
