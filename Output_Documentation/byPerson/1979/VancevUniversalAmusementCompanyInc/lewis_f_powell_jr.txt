justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
court
decided
moore
v.
simms?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
citation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
recall
that
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
share
mr.
justice
stewart's
confusion
about
your
position.
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
other
thing.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
take
it
that
the
attorneys'
fee
issue
is
not
before
us.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general
zwiener,
you
say
that
later
today
though
you
are
going
to
argue
another
issue.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
going
to
say
that
moore
v.
simms,
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
was
a
case
involving
a
pending
state
proceeding,
which
under
younger
barred
the
federal
court
from
proceeding
under
the
court's
holding.
and
here
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
expressly
held
the
younger
abstention
did
not
apply
because
there
is
no
pending
state
proceeding.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
why
are
you
going
to
ask
us
to
do
something
different
under
moore
v.
simms?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
mean
you
are
trying
criminal
intent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
zwiener,
in
any
event,
whatever
the
proceeding
is,
civil
or
criminal,
he
would
get
a
jail
term?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
much
of
a
jail
sentence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
he
has
violated,
how
does
he
purge
himself?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
now
if
it
is
decided
that
he
has,
what
is
he
punished
to?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general
zwiener,
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
unanswered
questions,
how
this
statute
will
be
construed.
but
am
i
correct
in
assuming
this
much
that
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
nuisance
under
this
statute,
the
sole
inquiry
of
the
court
would
be
as
to
the
content
of
the
motion
pictures
or
books
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
there
would
be
no
consideration
of
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
or
the
location
of
the
theater,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
isn't
it
true
thought
before
you
can
be
held
in
contempt
that
a
move
that
it
is
claimed
violates
the
injunction
would
have
to
be
found
to
be
obscene?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
--
your
colleague
disagrees
with
you
on
that
--
let's
assume
that
you
are
wrong
on
that
and
that
before
you
could
be
held
contempt
you
have
to
have
the
same
kind
of
finding
you
would
have
to
have
under
the
statute,
the
same
kind
of
determination
of
obscenity
that
you
would
have
to
have
under
the
statute.
would
you
still
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
us
assume
he
does
have
regular
film
and
there
is
no
issue
like
that
in
the
contempt
proceeding.
before
he
can
be
held
in
contempt,
there
will
have
to
be
a
determination
of
obscenity
of
the
film
that
he
has
shown.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there
is
a
criminal
trial.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
graves
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
as
you
read
that
injunction,
and
i
gather
what
you
were
reading
to
us
was
from
an
injunction
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
you
read
that,
that
appears
as
if
a
violation
of
a
future
exhibition
of
a
film
could
be
based
upon
and
a
finding
of
guilt
could
be
based
upon,
as
you
read
it
to
us,
an
isolated
excerpt
from
the
film
without
judging
the
obscenity
of
the
film
as
a
whole,
which
is
the
test
of
obscenity.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
am
i
right?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
it
is
just
an
isolated
incident.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
there
been
any
contempt
proceedings
for
violations
of
injunctions
of
this
kind?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
mean
in
texas.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
lawsuit
has
held
everything
up?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
think
is
the
form
of
the
contempt
proceeding
contemplated
by
this
statute,
civil
or
criminal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
fact
of
what
you
have
said
is
that
the
court
doesn't
say
just
stop
showing
this
picture,
but
stop
showing
any
picture
like
this.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
us
assume
that
in
some
other
context
as
a
perfectly
valid
injunction
and
the
injunction
that
you
would
concede
was
validly
issued
and
substantively
acceptable
and
then
there
is
an
order
to
show
cause
why
the
fellow
subject
to
the
injunction
shouldn't
be
held
in
criminal
contempt.
is
he
given
notice
given
notice
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
hearing
--
is
there
a
texas
rule
about
what
the
standard
of
proof
is
before
you
can
find
somebody
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
and
put
him
in
jail
for
a
term
certain?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
sure
--
of
course
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
under
this
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
there
were
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
beyond
that,
then
there
would
be
a
jury
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
is
it
12-man
or
6-man,
what
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
it
add
to
the
criminal
law.
it
changes
the
burden
of
proof,
it
deprives
a
person
of
a
jury
trial.
