mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
vance
v.
universal
amusement
company,
has
had
a
very
long,
tortuous
history,
starting
off
with
a
number
of
separate
cases
in
the
state
of
texas
and
some
20
of
those
cases
being
consolidated
before
one
three-judge
court.
as
a
consequence,
many
issues
got
obscured.
but
i
think
that
the
issue
that
is
presented
today
is
clear
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
can
be
any
prior
restraint
imposed
in
the
first
amendment
area.
can
there
be
any;
if
procedures
that
protect
first
amendment
rights
are
adopted,
can
there
then
be
the
type
of
thing
we
have
here,
an
injunction
against
the
future
showing
of,
in
this
case
obscene
movies
even
though
those
particular
movies
have
never
been
judicially
determined.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
the
brief
says
that
we
concede.
we
have
said
it
has
never
been
involved.
our
briefs
to
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
in
this
court,
that
is
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
your
honor,
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
all
right,
that
interpretation,
yes,
sir,
we
are
conceding
it.
but
i
hate
to
concede
it,
because
because
of
the
brief
of
the
amicus
in
this
case,
charles
keating,
argues
that
it
is
constitutional
and
we
will
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
it
wasn't
an
issue
below.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
--
this
case,
as
i
say
had
gotten
--
there
were
so
many
different
cases,
with
so
many
different
issues,
that
this
issue
never
really
got
squarely
presented
i
suppose
until
it
did
get
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
the
brief
says
that
this
particular
point
may
have
been
in
error
in
making
that
statement
because
of
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
think
that
the
court
can
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
we
will
tell
the
court
--
i
think
this
case
could
have
been
settled
early
on
if
moore
v.
simms
had
been
decided,
and
we
will
suggest
to
the
court
--
and
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
you
apply
moore
v.
simms,
you
can
hold
that
the
court
below
should
not
have
taken
this
case
at
all.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
this
brief
was
written
of
course
before
moore
v.
simms,
at
least
before
it
came
--
it
was
brought
to
our
consciousness.
and
it
actually
occurred
to
us
when
we
passed
a
new
obscenity
statute
which
was
contested
in
texas.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
this
court,
your
honor.
it
is
a
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
oh,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
was
decided
in
june.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
this
court
decided
it
on
the
principles
of
abstention,
and
we
would
say
that
that
discussion
in
moore
v.
simms
probably
would
have
required
the
court
below
in
this
case
to
have
dismissed
all
the
cases
and
that
the
state
courts
construe
its
own
statutes.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
why
--
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
concede
4666,
even
though
i
may
have
said
so.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
your
honor,
if
it
was
decided
on
that
basis,
i
am
sorry
i
misrepresented,
your
honor,
to
a
couple
of
courts,
because
i
said
that
there
was
no
reason
to
discuss
pullman
if
it
didn't
have
some
meaning
in
the
case,
because
obviously
younger
is
present
as
far
as
a
pending
case,
a
case
is
concerned.
as
i
say,
i
probably
argued
that
case
incorrectly,
from
what
your
honor
has
just
said.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
we
did
mention
it
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
we
have
not
argued
it
in
our
briefs.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
consider
that
in
deciding
this
case,
because
--
again,
because
we
have
these
multiplicity
of
cases
we
are
going
to
have
attorneys'
fees
possibly
levied
against
a
county
attorney
who
never
did
really
anything
in
this
particular
situation,
this
big
mass
of
cases.
we
just
suggest
that
maybe
a
lease
should
be
canceled,
or
at
least
talk
to
the
landlord
which
precipitated
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
your
honor,
we
will
hope
to
resolve
it,
the
issue
below.
but
i
would
like
to
clear
up
some
of
the
things
that
we
have
here.
4667
is
involved,
and
that
statute
says
if
the
habitual
use
of
--
or
of
premises
for
a
certain
purpose
will
be
enjoined.
it
says
the
use,
and
not
the
property.
that
is
why
we
were
saying
no
prosecutor
really
tried
to
apply
in
the
state
of
texas
4666
and
close
the
place
for
a
year.
the
reason
they
didn't
is
because
there
was
under
the
old
obscenity
statute,
before
it
was
amended
some
years
ago,
a
section
13
which
permitted
enjoining
premises
for
obscene
--
the
use
of
premises
for
obscene
matters.
and
that
did
not
permit
closing.
so
when
the
obscenity
statute
was
amended,
and
the
injunction
provisions
removed,
no
one
--
at
least
in
the
prosecution
area,
that
i
know
of
--
ever
considered
trying
to
padlock
for
a
year,
which
is
provided
for
in
4666.
it
just
didn't
occur
to
them.
now,
as
far
as
the
prior
restraint,
the
other
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
injunction
can
be
drawn
that
enjoins
the
use
of
premises
for
the
future
showing
of
pictures
which
have
not
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene
where
the
injunction
is
drawn
in
explicit
terms
as
far
as
the
sexual
conduct
enjoined
and
also
cites
the
requirements
of
miller.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
what
my
brief
says,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
say
that
today.
i
will
ask
the
court
later
to
set
aside
the
decision
below
on
the
basis
of
moore
v.
simms,
so
that
i
won't
be
caught
by
that
position.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
my
single
issue.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
no,
it
is
just
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
in
most
of
the
cases
the
consolidated
cases,
there
were
pending
civil
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
not
in
this
one.
and
i
was
also
going
to
ask
you,
based
on
what
i
thought
moore
v.
simms
said
about
the
pullman
abstention,
and
i
thought
that
was
a
basis
of
the
moore
v.
simms
holding,
that
where
you
had
a
state
statute
that
was
capable
of
constitutional
construction
by
the
state
courts,
the
federal
courts
would
give
the
state
courts
the
opportunity
to
consider
the
statute
and
make
those
constitutional
constructions.
and
i
would
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
until
you
had
told
me,
your
honor,
what
you
have
told
me,
your
honor,
you
do
discuss
the
pullman
doctrine.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
let's
talk
about
the
procedures,
which
is
criticized
by
the
appellee
that
in
texas
to
obtain
an
injunction,
mr.
frierson
argues
that
a
temporary
restraining
order
can
be
obtained
without
notice.
i
would
again
refer
the
court
to
article
16
of
the
old
obscenity
statute
527,
which
required
notice.
and
again,
in
most
situations
mr.
frierson
points
to
a
situation
in
the
case
in
dallas
where
apparently
there
was
not
notice,
i
point
to
a
case
that
came
out
of
austin
and
have
the
injunction
issued
in
that
case,
which
is
a
part
of
the
consolidated
cases
where
the
courts
expressly
said
there
will
be
no
temporary
restraining
orders
issued.
there
will
have
to
be
no
dissenting
hearing
before
there
will
be
an
injunction
in
this
type
of
case.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
because
that
notice
is
required,
and
i
think
that
in
most
instances
the
texas
courts
will
provide
it.
now,
there
is
a
hearing,
again
my
opposite
number
as
far
as
counsel
is
concerned,
disagree.
i
say
at
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction
that
the
question
of
obscenity
is
considered
and
decided
and
a
temporary
injunction
cannot
issue
without
that
decision.
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
roth
v.
state
and
richards
v.
state,
and
it
is
apparent
in
those
cases
if
the
question
of
obscenity
was
considered
at
the
injunction
hearing
and
also
on
appeal,
which
is
another
point
raised,
and
i
differ.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
what
we
do
--
well,
of
course
there
has
to
be
some
use
of
the
property
and
that
is
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
say
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
even
seek
injunction
unless
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right.
well,
then
as
far
as
the
future
use
of
the
premises,
again
we
--
the
injunction
does
recite
the
specific,
or
should
recite
the
specific
sexual
acts
that
are
prohibited
and
enjoined;
and
that
those
sexual
acts
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
are.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir.
and
those
sexual
matters
must
be
taken
in
the
light
of
miller.
now,
let
us
suppose
an
injunction
issues
under
those
circumstances.
a
temporary
injunction
is
appealed
in
texas
and,
by
the
way,
in
texas
as
in
the
federal
courts
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction
is
usually
the
trial.
and
very
often,
probably
more
often
than
not,
attorneys
agree
that
the
temporary
injunction
and
the
permanent
injunction
hearing
will
be
held
at
the
same
time.
so
the
evidence
is
presented
there
and
for
all
practical
purposes
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
because
everybody
has
put
on
just
about
everything
he
has
at
that
point.
a
temporary
injunction
is
appealable
in
texas,
it
is
an
expedited
appeal,
the
record
must
be
filed
in
20
days,
and
the
court
can
consider
it
even
without
briefs
in
order
to
expedite
consideration
on
appeal.
so
this
kind
of
injunction
does
have
that
protection
in
expedited
appeal.
but
here
is
where
we
come
to,
i
guess
to
me,
the
proposition
that
makes
me
wonder
why
we
have
come
all
this
except
it
is
a
matter
of
principle,
and
i
shouldn't
have
said
what
i
said.
i
think
this
is
important.
but
in
texas
when
there
is
a
contempt
hearing
--
all
right,
we
have
an
injunction
against
some
premises
enjoining
the
showing
of
obscene
movies.
a
complaint
is
filed
saying
that
injunction
has
been
violated.
the
complainant,
who
ordinarily
would
be
the
county
or
district
attorney,
must
come
into
court
and
prove
that
the
injunction
has
been
violated,
which
means
for
any
move
to
be
shown
or
any
book
to
be
displayed
in
a
book
store
he
has
got
to
go
through
the
same
type
of
proof
that
he
would
if
he
defiled
a
criminal
obscenity
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
the
burden
of
proof
probably
in
getting
the
injunction
in
texas
at
this
time
would
be
preponderance
of
evidence.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right,
i
think
in
that
situation
probably
the
test
is
a
clear
and
convincing
test.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
mean
if
you
issue
this
complaint
--
say
there
has
been
an
outstanding
injunction
and
there
is
a
claim
it
has
been
violated,
then
you
issue
a
complaint.
and
is
this
for
a
civil
or
a
criminal
contempt?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
if
it
is
civil
of
course
there
may
not
be
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
we
can
send
a
person
to
jail
so
that
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
purges
himself.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
take
that
from
the
law
of
texas.
my
guess
is
a
texas
court
would
hold
in
this
kind
of
situation,
since
a
jail
term
is
involved,
again
looking
to
the
cases
where
persons
have
been
committed
to
mental
institutions,
that
probably
a
texas
court
in
all
fairness
will
use
the
clear
and
convincing
test.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
doubt
it.
i
can
tell
you
what
the
law
of
texas
is
in
this.
i
have
had
law
clerks
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--
the
courts
of
texas
have
never
told
me
what
criminal
and
civil
contempt
is,
i
don't
know
what
the
burden
of
proof
is,
and
i
have
to
confess
it
to
the
court.
if
i
could
have,
it
would
have
been
in
a
brief.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
he
could
be
confined
to
jail
until
he
purges
himself.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
until
he
purges
himself.
that
is
permissible.
there
is
also
a
statute
that
sets
a
fine.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
he
purges
himself
by
not
showing
this
particular
movie
or
taking
that
particular
magazine
off
the
shelf.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
right.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
he
hasn't
violated
an
injunction
until
it
is
proved
that
he
has
shown
an
obscene
movie,
that
is
true,
and
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
and
you
are
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
that
he
quit
showing
the
movie.
i
would
analyze
this
in
terms
of
what
happens
in
child
cases
where
the
husband
does
not
pay
for
child
care.
he
has
already
violated
the
statute.
and
yet
when
he
pays,
he
gets
out
of
jail.
i
am
not
sure
there
is
any
difference.
that
is
the
best
i
could
do.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
what
we
are
saying,
that
4667
imposes
no
more
burden,
threat
to
free
speech
than
does
a
penal
statute.
i
think
that
is
the
bottom
line.
i
do
invite
the
court
to
the
brief
filed
by
amicus
charles
keating
in
which
he
argues
that
under
general
commonwealth
principles
4666
is
--
would
be
constitutional
and
he
cites
art
theaters
guild
v.
ewing
--
i
believe
it
is
an
ohio
case
--
cited
in
his
brief
as
authority
for
this
court's
approval
of
a
closure
statute.
and
as
i
would
have
closed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
with
moore
v.
simms
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
thank
you,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
that
if
moore
v.
simms
does
not
extend
pullman
to
this
type
of
situation,
that
this
court
should
give
consideration
where
there
is
a
state
statute
that
is
capable
of
constitutional
construction
by
the
state
courts,
that
an
extension
of
pullman
would
seem
dictated,
or
at
least
desirable.
it
would
save
the
time
of
the
federal
courts,
it
would
give
the
state
courts
a
chance
to
construe
their
own
statutes,
and
the
texas
courts
have
accepted
the
invitation
of
this
court
in
miller
to
construe
the
statutes
in
conformity
with
this
court's
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
just
a
minute,
your
honor,
i
would
still
repeat
that
this
texas
injunction
statute
has
no
more
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
rights
than
does
the
texas
or
any
other
criminal
or
any
other
obscenity
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
not
sure
that
we
do,
to
be
frank;
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
think
it
adds
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
is
a
cumbersome
process
and
i
don't
know
that
the
prosecutor
after
more
than
two
rounds
will
ever
use
it
again.
however,
i
would
say
that
the
cause
that
mr.
graves
has
imagined
with
respect
to
some
situations
that
could
happen
in
these
kinds
of
injunction
proceedings,
and
what
the
consequences
might
be
against
moore
v.
simms,
he
has
got
a
far-ranging,
broad-based
attack.
most
of
these
problems
would
have
probably
been
settled
by
the
texas
courts
if
they
had
had
the
opportunity
four
years
ago
to
worry
about
some
of
the
things
we
are
worrying
here.
and
i
do
suggest
that
moore
v.
simms
might
be
a
solution,
if
not
i
suggest
that
this
statute
should
be
held
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
thank
you.
