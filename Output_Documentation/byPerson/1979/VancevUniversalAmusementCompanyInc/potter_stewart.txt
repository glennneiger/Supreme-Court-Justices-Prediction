mr.
ziener
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
say
so,
with
all
due
respect,
that
it
is
a
little
difficult
reading
the
briefs
to
discern
what
the
issues
are
in
this
case,
at
least
it
was
for
me.
but,
in
any
event,
may
i
ask
you.
do
you
concede
that
article
4666
is
not
involved
in
this
case
now
before
us
and
you
do
so
because
you
concede
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
article?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
holding
of
the
court
that
this
article
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
am
quoting
from
your
brief
now,
is
not
questioned
by
these
appellants
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
that
the
equivalent
of
conceding?
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
not,
then
correct
me.
justice
potter
stewart
another
amicus
argues
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
you
say
it
is
not
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
that
cause
me
not
a
little
confusion
in
reading
this
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
make
that
argument
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
your
brief,
if
not
to
your
oral
argument
today,
that
is
the
only
issue
presented
to
us
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
you
have
just
stated.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
with
that?
that
is
what
your
brief
seems
to
say,
seems
to
say
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
today?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
dismissed
this
case
entirely
but
was
correct
in
considering
the
merits
on
the
merits
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
only
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
in
this
one.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
zwiener,
what
is
the
question
of
obscenity
when
you
are
talking
about
unknown
films
or
books
in
the
future;
what
can
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
an
identified
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
pictures
or
books
in
the
future.
how
can
you
determine
the
question
of
their
obscenity?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
simply
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
question
of
obscenity
is
considered?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
we
are
talking
about
books
or
movies.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
he
just
did.
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
defendant
have
a
right
if
he
wanted
one
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
he
already
has
by
definition
according
to
the
state
violated
the
injunction.
how
can
he
un-ring
a
bell;
how
can
he
purge
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
trial,
the
issue
on
whether
he
has
committed
contempt
would
be
determined
by
deciding
whether
he
has
shown
an
obscene
movie.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
meaning
of
miller.
justice
potter
stewart
and
type
filmed
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
a
specific,
identified
name.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
view
is
not
it
is
now
an
issue
here.
