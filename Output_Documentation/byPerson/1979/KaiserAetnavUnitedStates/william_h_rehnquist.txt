in
kaiser
aetna
versus
united
states,
in
this
case
petitioners
challenge
the
decision
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
holding
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
a
free
right
of
access
to
the
privately
developed
hawaii
kai
marina.
petitioner
kaiser
aetna
developed
the
marina
by
dredging
and
filling
kuapa
pond
which
was
a
shallow
lagoon
on
the
island
of
oahu,
hawaii
that
covered
523
acres
and
extended
approximately
2
miles
inland
from
maunalua
bay
which
is
an
arm
of
the
pacific
ocean.
the
sole
question
presented
is
whether
petitioner's
improvements
to
the
pond
allowed
the
government
under
the
commerce
clause
to
convert
it
to
a
public
aquatic
park
after
petitioner's
had
invested
a
good
deal
of
money
in
improving
it
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
a
privately
owned
pond
leased
to
them.
ponds
such
as
kuapa
pond
were
once
an
integral
part
of
the
hawaiian
feudal
system.
they've
always
been
considered
to
be
private
property
by
landowners
and
by
the
hawaiian
government.
title
to
the
ponds
can
be
traced
back
to
the
great
mahele
or
royal
land
division
in
which
king
kamehameha
iii
allotted
large
units
known
as
ahupuaas,
if
i'm
right
in
hawaiian
pronunciation.
kuapa
pond
was
part
of
an
ahupuaas
that
was
eventually
leased
to
kaiser
aetna
for
subdivision
development.
the
development
became
what
is
now
known
as
hawaii
kai.
in
dredging
and
filling
kuapa
pond,
kaiser
aetna
increased
the
average
depth
the
pond
from
2
to
six
feet.
kaiser
aetna
also
erected
retaining
walls,
built
ridges
within
the
development,
made
accommodations
for
pleasure
boats
and
created
a
route
of
access
for
boats
that
connected
the
marina
to
maunalua
bay
and
the
pacific
ocean.
the
army
corps
of
engineers
acquiesced
in
all
of
this
development
--
in
all
of
petitioner's
improvements
made
prior
to
1972.
but
in
that
year,
a
dispute
arose
between
petitioners
and
the
corps
concerning
whether
petitioners
were
required
to
obtain
approval
in
accordance
with
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
for
future
construction,
excavation
and
filling
in
the
marina
and
whether
petitioners
were
precluded
from
denying
the
public
access
to
the
pond
because
as
a
result
of
the
improvements
it
had
become
a
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
the
dispute
foreseeably
ripened
into
a
lawsuit
by
the
united
states
government
against
the
petitioners
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
court
of
hawaii.
at
the
time
of
trial,
a
marina
style
community
of
approximately
22,000
persons
surrounded
kuapa
pond.
it
included
approximately
1500
marina
waterfront
lot
lessees.
these
lessees
along
with
at
least
86
non-marina
lot
lessees
from
hawaii
kai
and
56
boat
owners
who
were
not
residents
of
hawaii
kai
pay
fees
for
maintenance
of
the
pond
and
for
patrol
boats
that
remove
floating
debris
and
force
boating
regulations
and
maintain
the
privacy
and
security
of
the
pond.
kaiser
aetna
controls
access
to
and
use
of
the
marina
with
a
few
minor
exceptions,
it
is
generally
not
permitted
commercial
use.
the
united
states
district
court
held
that
the
government
lacked
the
authority
to
open
the
now
dredged
pond
to
the
public
without
payment
of
the
compensation
to
the
owner
although
it
recognized
that
the
united
states
had
the
right
to
regulate
under
the
commerce
clause
and
navigational
servitude.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
as
to
the
first
holding
of
the
district
court
holding
that
the
marina
had
become
a
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
that
as
a
result
of
the
federal
navigational
servitude
which
arises
from
congress'
authority
to
regulate
navigation
or
the
commerce
clause,
the
public
has
a
right
of
unlimited
access
to
the
pond.
we
now
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
although
the
now
dredged
pond
may
fall
within
the
definition
of
navigable
waters
as
this
court
has
used
that
term
and
delimiting
the
boundaries
of
congress'
regulatory
authority
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
does
not
follow
that
all
of
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
congress'
power
to
regulate
navigation
and
those
dealing
with
the
so-called
navigational
servitude
can
simply
be
lumped
into
one
basket.
with
the
navigational
servitude
argument
to
the
government
herein
necessarily
rests
on
that
doctrine
as
an
offspring
of
the
broad
authority
granted
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
but
that
authority
is
subject
to
the
limits
of
a
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
here,
the
government's
attempt
to
create
a
public
right
of
access
to
the
improved
pond
goes
so
far
beyond
ordinary
regulation
or
improvement
for
navigation
involved
in
typical
riparian
condemnation
cases
that
it
amounts
to
a
taking
requiring
just
compensation
under
this
decision
--
this
court's
decision
in
pennsylvania
coal
company
against
mahon.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
had
joined.
