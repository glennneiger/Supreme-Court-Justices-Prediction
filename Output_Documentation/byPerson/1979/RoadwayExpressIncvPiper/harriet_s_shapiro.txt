ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
function
here
today
is
to
emphasize
the
government's
disagreement
with
petitioner's
reading
of
section
1927
which
singles
out
lawyers
litigating
cases
under
federal
statutes
that
provide
for
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees.
and
my
basic
point
is
that
these
attorney
fee
statutes
provide
for
recovery
against
the
opposing
party.
it
distorts
their
purpose
to
read
them
as
also
approving
of
recovery
against
counsel
for
that
party.
the
attorney
fee
provisions
in
the
civil
rights
act
are
typical
of
those
in
many
other
federal
statutes.
they
serve
two
related
purposes.
the
first
purpose
is
to
encourage
private
parties
to
enforce
important
federal
policies.
that's
the
private
attorney
general
principle.
the
cost
of
hiring
counsel
is
likely
to
be
a
serious
problem
to
victims
of
employment
discrimination.
but
that
problem
is
less
serious
if
successful
plaintiffs
can
recover
their
counsel
fees.
that
means
that
the
case
--
the
litigation
will
essentially
pay
for
itself.
the
--
that
makes
it
attractive
from
the
point
of
view
of
lawyers
and
the
congress
recognized
that
in
civil
rights
cases,
it's
a
problem
finding
lawyers
that
were
willing
to
take
these
cases.
but
if
counsel
fee
--
fees
can
be
paid
from
--
by
the
--
by
the
--
can
be
recovered
by
the
prevailing
party,
then
the
lawyers
are
more
likely
to
be
interested
in
taking
the
cases.
they'd
become
attractive
cases.
but
if
litigating
these
cases
imposes
a
special
risk
that's
not
part
of
the
normal
risks
of
litigating
cases
in
any
event,
then
the
cases
are
unattractive
to
the
lawyers.
that
makes
it
harder
for
the
victims
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true
but
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
--
the
lawyers'
fees
are
recoverable
to
the
prevailing
party,
but
as
reading
piggie
park
and
christiansburg,
the
standards
are
different.
so
--
and
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
can
expect
to
recover
his
fees
absent
at
extraordinary
circumstances.
so
that
he's
the
one
that
gets
--
is
encouraged
to
take
the
case.
the
defendant's
lawyer
doesn't
--
the
court
--
the
congress
didn't
feel
that
he
needed
this
special
incentive
and
for
the
reasons
that
are
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
spelled
out
in
christiansburg
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
only
if
the
defendant
is
essentially
blameless
if
the
suit
is
without
merit.
in
that
situation,
yes,
then
the
--
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
recover
his
costs.
it's
not
merely
as
generous
a
cost
provision.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
court
really
faced
that
problem
in
christiansburg,
because
in
christiansburg
you
made
it
fairly
clear
that
you
--
you
were
not
saying
that
only
the
bad
faith
plaintiff
was
--
could
--
could
expect
to
have
counsel's
--
i
mean,
attorney's
fees
recovered
against
him.
that
--
the
--
the
--
it
--
it
was
also
the
frivolous
case
regardless
of
bad
faith.
so
that
i
think
you've
already
faced
in
christiansburg,
the
fact
that
you
do
decide
--
look
to
the
party
to
make
sure
that
he
doesn't
bring
frivolous
suits.
not
just
saying,
“well,
i
was
misled.”
that
it's
up
to
the
party
to
assure
that
his
--
that
--
that
he
doesn't
bring
a
frivolous
suit.
but
if
he
does,
then
he
bears
the
risk
of
having
counsel
fees
as
against
him.
and
i
think
that
this
is
--
it's
important
that
that's
where
the
line
has
been
drawn
between
the
protection
of
defendants
and
the
protection
of
plaintiffs.
that
your
--
you
get
the
problem
and
the
--
the
difficulty
with
the
--
petitioner's
point
of
view
is
that
1927
is
penal
and
it's
looking
at
the
attorney's
responsibility.
the
attorney's
responsibility
for
the
way
he
litigates
that
the
--
the
other
--
the
attorney
fee
provisions
in
the
substantive
statutes
are
not
penal.
they
are
looking
at
the
merits
of
the
case
and
either
that
encourage
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
--
the
purpose
of
saying
the
fees
are
part
of
the
cost
in
the
substantive
statutes
is
(a)
to
the
--
this
--
this
private
attorney
general
principle
to
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
that
1927
was
part
of
the
original
bill
in
1853
that
said
these
--
as
to
these
costs
and
no
others
are
to
be
recovered.
and
so
that
the
costs
in
1927
are
the
costs
that
are
defined
in
1920
and
1923.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
then
you
wouldn't
have
the
singling
out
problem
which
is
our
basic
--
that's
the
--
the
problem
with
the
--
the
--
our
fundamental
policy
problem.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
what
--
what
we're
--
i
--
if
you
can
just
have
a
statute
that
said
attorney's
fees
here
are
--
are
part
of
the
costs
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
--
and
they're
allowable
to
the
prevailing
party
without
amending
1927,
then
you
would
still
have
1927
as
part
of
--
i
mean,
assuming
this
statute
didn't
overrule
the
1853
act.
we
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
--
the
--
there
is
--
there
has
been
a
proposal.
there
is
a
proposal
in
congress
to
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
sure.
and
well
--
well,
the
proposal
is
to
amend
1927.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i'd
--
i
think
that
would
probably
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
when
you
have
this
--
the
singling
out,
you
get
real
policy
problems.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
--
the
argument
really
is
that
you're
in
--
in
the
substantive
statutes,
you're
talking
about
costs
--
shifting
costs
against
the
parties
and
that
--
that
however
that
line
is
drawn
between
the
parties,
it's
drawn
on
the
basis
of
the
merits
of
the
suit.
1927
says
nothing
about
prevailing
parties.
it
says
excess
costs.
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
this
--
that's
up
--
and
we
agree.
a
misbehaving
lawyer
is
a
misbehaving
lawyer
and
he
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
regardless
of
what
kind
of
a
statute
he
is
litigating
under.
he
is
subject
to
the
penalties
that
are
provided
in
1927
which
are
conventional
costs.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
because
the
purpose
of
putting
the
particular
cost
in
a
particular
statute
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
is
for
a
different
--
there's
a
different
basis
for
that.
and
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
