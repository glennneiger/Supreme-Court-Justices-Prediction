justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
--
one
reason
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
was
the
--
that
1927
should
be
construed
strictly
because
they're
regarded
as
penal
in
nature.
did
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
you
would
be
consistent
with
the
language
in
newman
v.
piggie
park
enterprises
where
--
where
they
say
that
--
the
court
said
that
an
attorney's
fee
award
flows
almost
as
a
matter
of
right,
if
you
prevail
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
authority
is
that?
i
mean
is
it
authority
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
richard,
do
you
--
do
you
support
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
saying
that
1927
should
be
strictly
construed
because
it's
penal
in
nature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
--
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
language
in
newman
versus
piggie
park
that
says
where
the
--
a
plaintiff
bringing
a
title
vii
case
is
on
--
the
attorney's
fees
should
be
awarded
almost
as
a
matter
of
course?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
punished
the
defendant
in
a
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
in
--
in
1927
that
it
is
intended
to
punish
people
who
violate
its
conduct
in
a
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
--
so
that
--
the
--
the
two
really
stand
pretty
much
on
the
same
footing,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
one
--
one
man's
meat
is
another
man's
poison.
in
a
sense
the
plaintiff
--
plaintiff's
lawyer
gets
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
the
plaintiffs
got,
the
defendants
get
the
attorney's
fees
and
award
against
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
court
the
appeals,
was
it?
in
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
you
--
there
should
have
been
no
award
of
attorney's
fees.
they
said
you
can
never
award
the
--
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
have
to
say
that
with
respect
to
all
the
other
federal
statutes
that
provide
for
the
award
of
an
--
an
attorney's
fees
in
addition
to
ordinary
cost
too,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
never
have
attorney's
fees
as
a
part
of
the
award
under
this
1927
--
under
your
view.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
said
under
no
event
could
attorney's
fees
be
awarded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
shapiro
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
on
both
sides
is
provided
in
title
vii
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
--
so
that
in
--
in
effect,
the
lawyer
who
undertakes
to
defend
a
civil
--
a
title
vii
action
is
faced
with
the
same
sort
of
problem
as
the
lawyer
who
takes
on
the
plaintiff's
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
who
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
congress
has
given
him
a
special
incentive
to
a
certain
extent,
because
it
does
authorize
the
award
of
--
of
attorney's
fees
as
cost
to
the
defendant
and
under
the
christiansburg
standard
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
--
the
--
is
it
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
used
--
you
--
you
used
the
language
of
fees
as
part
of
the
--
the
cost
in
the
statute
in
--
in
one
statute
as
the
--
entirely
different
meaning
than
in
1927.
