paul

mr.
mckee,
isn't
there
an
immediate
ground
that
simply
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
with
instructions
for
them
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
think
the
district
court
allowed
the
proper
fees?
i
mean,
i
don't
--
we
don't
--
they
didn't
reach
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
might
well,
if
they
say
some
fees
are
awardable,
might
have
said,
“well,
these
are
a
little
too
much.”
but
that's
up
to
them
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
some
fees
would
be
appropriate,
if
they're
ever
appropriate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't
address
the
question
of
how
much
should
be
awarded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
richard,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
section
1920
which
describes
taxable
cost.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
is
that
1927
does
pick
up
those
items
of
taxable
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
does
it
pick
up
those
items
of
taxable
cost
that
have
been
added
recently?
for
example,
i
think
that
you
meant
that
a
statute
is
now
--
allows
compensation
to
court-appointed
experts
and
interpreters
and
some
other
things
that
were
not
part
of
the
statute
when
1927
was
first
enacted.
are
they
properly
taxed
upon
their
--
against
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
include
subsequently
added
cost,
why
don't
you
include
attorney's
fees
which
are
taxable
as
part
of
the
cost
in
title
vii
litigations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
not
if
1920,
is
that
the
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
--
they're
not
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
would
read
section
1927
and
saying
those
costs
authorized
by
section
1920
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
nothing
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
on
the
same
chapter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
shapiro,
we're
dealing
with
exceptional
cases
to
start
with,
because
most
lawyers
don't
misbehave
and
give
rise
to
claims
of
this
kind.
and
i
think
we
have
to
start
with
the
assumption,
the
lawyers
did
something
the
lawyers
do
not
normally
do.
and
if
you
have
a
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
perhaps
named
as
a
class
representative
or
something
is
relatively
unsophisticated
and
the
lawyer
persuades
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
totally
meritorious
--
meritless
claim
and
makes
a
lot
of
trouble
for
the
other
side
and
runs
up
the
kind
of
situation
where
normally
a
district
judge
would
say,
“the
plaintiff
ought
to
be
charged
with
cost.”
your
position
really
is
that
they
shouldn't
recover
from
anybody
because
he
is
the
one
that
stick
the
innocent
plaintiff
with
him
and
so
you're
saying
nobody
should
have
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
penal
but
per
se
fees
are
part
of
the
cost.
but
once
they
say
fees
are
part
of
the
cost,
how
do
you
get
out
of
the
statutory
language?
how
do
you
meet
the
(voice
overlap)
pure
language
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
1920
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
with
mr.
justice
white's
statute
in
the
subsection
7
of
1920.
they're
just
an
additional
item
of
cost
and
addition
to
docket
fees,
just
say
attorney's
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
supposing
they
were
passed,
would
that
not
be
picked
up
by
1927
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
if
we
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
if
we
just
amended
1920.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
your
--
what
you're
saying
is,
it
only
--
the
word,
cost,
only
applies
if
it's
cost
in
all
litigation.
it
doesn't
apply
if
it's
a
special
kind
of
cost
for
one
kind
case
like
civil
rights
or
antitrust
or
something
like
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
problem
that
i
--
i
see
with
your
argument
is
you
seem
to
assume
that
the
singling
out
was
totally
for
the
benefit
of
the
plaintiffs.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
whichever
party
prevails,
there's
a
right
to
cost
--
an
opportunity
to
have
the
judges
assess
fees
as
part
of
the
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
you.
we
have
--
but
just
you
got
a
special
statute
1927
dealing
with
misbehaving
lawyers.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
say
a
misbehaving
lawyer
is
any
different
in
one
kind
of
case
than
another.
at
least
to
be
in
any
--
any
kind
of
case
is
assuming
it
can
be
--
he
can
be
treated.
it
comes
within
the
statutory
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
consequences
of
misbehavior
are
that
you
have
to
pay
the
costs,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
pay
whatever
the
costs
are
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
plaintiffs.
