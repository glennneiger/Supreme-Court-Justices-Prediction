justice
byron
r.
white
in
1927
only
runs
against
a
party,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
the
attorney's
fee
provision
that
says
that
--
says
that
the
--
the
party
is
to
pay
attorney's
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
normally,
they're
taxed
against
the
losing
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
--
what
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
--
i
suppose
that
just
because
the
district
court
found
that
the
litigation
had
been
vexatious
and
unjustified
that
the
district
court
was
bound
to
award
them
a
cost.
or
that
the
(inaudible)
awarded
a
cost
that
he
was
bound
to
include
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
the
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
--
what's
the
style
--
what's
his
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
my
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
we
just
say
discretion,
it's
in
the
judge's
discretion
--
my
question
really
goes
to,
what
if
we
happen
to
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong?
what
do
we
do
then?
we
--
they
don't
necessarily
reinstate
the
district
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
says
--
assume
we
agree
with
you
that
the
--
that
--
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
--
that
you
--
that
you
can
keep
your
district
court
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
and
--
and
i
would
--
that
you
might
say
that
there's
a
--that
there's
some
other
standard
that
ought
to
be
followed.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
you
can
never
include
attorney's
fees,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
agree
with
you
that
sometimes
you
can.[laughs]
then
--
and
then
do
we
automatically
then
agree
with
the
district
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
would
say.
and
if
we
will
agree
with
you,
we
should
reverse
and
--
and
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
see
if
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
could've
--
here,
the
plaintiff
is
sued
and
lost,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
then
attorney's
fees
were
assessed
against
the
lawyer
for
the
plaintiff
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
could
the
--
could
an
attorney's
fee
have
been
allowed
to
the
defendant
against
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
some
of
--
was
this
the
kind
of
a
case
that
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
that
--
so
that
the
prevailing
party,
in
proper
circumstances
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
as
the
defendant
could've
--
hadn't
--
might
have
had
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
plaintiff
as
a
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
they
--
they
--
but
nevertheless,
it
was
the
kind
--
in
these
very
circumstances,
the
district
judge
would
not
have
abused
his
discretion,
i
suppose,
if
he
had
awarded
attorney's
fees
in
favor
of
the
defendant
against
the
plaintiff
as
a
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
see
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
award
wasn't
here
--
wasn't
based
on
bringing
a
frivolous
case,
but
on
--
on
needless
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
let
me
go
back.
suppose
--
suppose
there
had
been
an
award
of
--
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
as
a
party
on
the
--
on
the
grounds
--
suppose
the
plaintiff
had
made
a
--
or
the
defendant,
suppose
the
defendant
had
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
on
the
grounds
that
this
had
been
a
frivolous
litigation
and
said
--
said,
“we
are
the
prevailing
party.
this
is
a
proper
case
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.”
and
suppose
the
district
judge
said,
“you're
quite
right.
you
are
entitled
to
attorney's
fees,
but
i'll
tell
you
what
i'm
going
to
do.
i
think
it'd
be
unfair
to
make
the
plaintiff
pay
them.
i
think
--
well,
i'll
make
his
lawyer
pay
him
because
he's
the
one
who
brought
this
frivolous
case
and
needlessly
ran
the
bill
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
that
would
--
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
you
still
be
making
this
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand.
but
suppose
the
attorney's
fees
weren't
even
involved
here
and
the
defendant
wins
the
case
and
the
plaintiff
has
to
pay
his
--
is
supposed
his
cost,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
judge
says,
“well,
i
think
this
is
a
proper
case
for
1927
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
i'm
going
to
make
the
plaintiff
--
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
pay
the
cost
rather
than
the
plaintiff.
that's
what
happens,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
--
let's
just
--
let's
suppose
that
--
that
because
of
the
lawyer's
conduct,
costs
were
increased.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant's
costs
were
increased
and
he
won.
and
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
have
to
pay
his
cost.
let's
forget
the
attorney's
fees
for
the
moment,
just
cost.
and
then
the
judge
says
these
costs
were
ran
up
by
vexatious
litigation
by
this
attorney,
so
i'm
going
to
make
the
attorney
pay
him
rather
the
--
rather
than
his
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
now,
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
you
just
can't
fit
1927
and
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
statute
together.
this
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
grounds
are
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
--
don't
you
think
it
would
be
proper
for
a
judge
to
award
attorney
to
--
to
the
--
under
1927?
wouldn't
it
be
proper
to
award
a
cost
to
stick
the
attorney
with
cost
if
the
judge
sought
the
action
was
just
simply
frivolous
and
vexatious,
just
no
merit
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
want
to
--
it
says
“who
so
multiplies
the
proceedings
in
any
case.”
well,
the
best
--
the
first
time
you
multiply
it
is
when
you
file
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly.
assuming
that
it
had
absolutely
no
merit
to
begin
with
and
it
was
just
vexatious.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
ms.
shapiro,
what
if
--
what
if
a
general
statute
were
passed?
what
if
the
congress
just
decided
to
change
the
so
called
american
rule
and
say
from
here
on,
we'll
adopt
the
british
rule
that
the
--
that
ordinarily,
attorney's
fees
will
be
allowed
to
the
prevailing
party
as
a
part
of
cost.
suppose
there
was
a
general
statute
like
that
--
just
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
how
that
gets
you,
though
to
--
to
excluding
attorney's
fees
from
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
my
example
that
i
take
it,
you
would
say
that,
“well,
i
guess
--
i
guess
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
--
are
--
are
part
of
the
cost
that
can
be
charged
against
the
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they're
allowable
to
the
prevailing
party.
