mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
first
make
it
clear
that
our
argument
does
not
intend
to
take
the
position
as
continued
somewhat
by
the
reply
brief
filed
by
roadway
that
lawyers
are
immune
from
--
or
--
or
so
have
some
form
of
immunity
from
the
court's
sanctioning
those
lawyers.
i
think
that's
--
that
there
are
--
there's
adequate
legislation
to
allow
the
imposition
of
sanction
on
lawyers.
in
fact
in
this
case,
rule
37
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
was
available.
in
fact,
that's
how
this
whole
attorney's
fee
business
got
started.
a
motion
was
filed
by
counsel
for
roadway
to
assess
attorney's
fees
under
rule
37
for
failure
to
answer
interrogatories
and
for
failure
to
appear
in
the
deposition.
the
thing
moved
a
long
way
from
there
to
an
awarding
by
district
court
of
$17,000.
in
other
words,
the
attorney's
fees
in
the
whole
case
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
in
--
in
the
piggie
park
case,
the
awarding
of
attorney's
fees
was
not
to
punish
the
defendant,
but
--
but
it
was
the
furtherance
of
the
federal
--
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
eliminate
discrimination.
it
was
to
encourage
the
--
the
so
called
private
attorney
general.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
it
did.
it
punished
the
defendant
to
the
extent
that
they
had
to
pay
attorney's
fees,
but
they
--
and
to
the
extent
that
--
that
he
--
he
could
almost
make
the
argument
that
they
violated
the
law,
so
it
was
justifiable
for
them
to
be
punished.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
1927
is
designed
to
punish
lawyers.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
idea
of
--
of
the
so
--
the
attorney's
fees
provisions
if
you
get
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
--
of
this
--
of
the
provisions
to
allow
attorney's
fees
was
to
punish
the
lawyers,
but
rather
to
encourage
the
--
the
attorneys
to
take
the
source
of
cases
that
need
to
be
handled.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
what
you
have
to
look
at
though
was
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
--
the
statute
clearly
provides
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
under
2000e-5
(k)
in
the
--
and
the
--
the
provision
being
interpreted
in
piggie
park.
but
the
purpose,
i
mean
the
--
the
reason
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
fifth
circuit
felt
the
--
the
reference
to
the
fleischmann
case
was
--
was
important
was
that
the
language
of
1927
is
certainly
not
plain
and
--
and
unmistakable
because
it
just
says
cost
and
it
sure
doesn't
say
attorney's
fees.
and
the
purpose
of
--
of
any
--
of
the
strict
construction
rule
is
to
ensure
that
for
one
thing
that
the
lawyer
in
this
case
and
this
--
under
1927,
knows
what's
coming.
he
--
he
--
when
he
just
reads
cost,
he
sure
doesn't
--
he
--
he
would
--
he
would
think
that's
cost.
that's
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
say
attorney's
fees.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
this
--
in
--
this
case
was
dismissed
without
prejudice
in
this
case.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
it
would
--
it
would
--
certainly
it
--
and
that's
--
excuse
me,
did
you
say
attorney's
fees
awarded
against
the
--
the
plaintiff's
individual
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes,
this
is
a
title
vii.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
under
christians
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
under
christiansburg.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
right.
but
the
--
that
that
was
not
the
case
in
--
in
this
--
not
--
it
was
not
the
situation
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
and
--
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
not
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
in
this
case,
under
these
facts,
there's
no
facts
to
award
attorney's
fees
against
the
party
based
on
the
rationale
of
christiansburg.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
the
christiansburg
looks
to
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
whether
it
was
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
unreasonable
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
groundless,
frivolous
i
believe,
is
the
other
word.
the
record
reflects
that
two
of
the
three
plaintiffs
were
--
filed
their
claim
through
the
eeoc
and
reasonable
cause
for
discrimination
was
found
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
with
regard
to
two
of
the
three
claimants.
and
so
if
that
--
that's
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
if
you
want
to
cut
off
the
merits
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
of
the
claim.
so
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
as
in
this
case,
under
these
facts,
i
don't
believe
you
could
award
some
of
the
state's
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
the
conduct
of
the
lawyers.
right.
that
--
that's
--
that's
the
problem,
your
honors,
with
--
with
the
argument
being
made
by
roadway
in
this
case.
they
--
they
say
on
page
17
of
their
brief
and
i
think
this
is
basic
to
the
--
is
basically
their
problem
with
their
rationale.
the
authority
of
the
basic
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
case
is
not
section
1927.
you've
got
to
get
attorney's
fees
out
of
2000e-5
(k)
and
1988
as
interpreted
by
christiansburg
before
you
can
hop
over
to
1927.
and
the
facts
in
this
case
don't
support
that.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
2000e-5
(k)
or
1988
support
nobody.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
they
said
you
can
--
that
the
--
the
issue
was
not
fully
--
not
considered
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals
like
it
has
been
briefed
here
in
--
in
this
court,
your
honor.
and
the
--
the
--
as
i
was
saying,
the
legislative
history
and
of
it
--
of
the
civil
rights
and
statutes
providing
attorney's
fees
and
particularly
when
you
look
at
1927
and
the
history
of
that
statute
as
the
--
the
statute
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
alyeska
case
and
--
and
in
that
decision
as
--
it's
clear
that
19
--
well,
it's
--
it's
just
the
--
those
--
the
legislation
is
clear
that
it
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
that
section
--
or
what
has
become
section
1920
and
section
1923
all
of
which
deal
with
the
definition
of
cost
and
what
they
call
a
docket
fees
or
proctor's
fees
can
be
awarded.
and
that
is
the
limitation.
congress
has
--
as
this
court
has
said
in
--
in
alyeska,
congress
has,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
attorney's
fees,
has
gotten
into
the
act.
and
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
so
called
roving
authority
to
grant
attorney's
fees
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
the
--
the
problem
with
--
regardless
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes,
because
congress
has
stepped
into
the
act,
into
the
bridge
as
far
as
what
1927
says.
you
--
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
is
based
on
the
congressional
--
the
--
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
or
--
excuse
me.
the
award
of
cost
against
counsel
is
based
on
nine
--
section
1927.
congress
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
you've
got
to
go
back
to
1927
and
read
1927
as
for
what
it
says
that
the
--
the
lawyer
multiplies
the
proceedings
in
any
case
as
to
increase
cost
unreasonably
and
vexatiously.
that's
the
--
that's
the
standard.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
and
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
and
just
because
the
plaintiff
lost,
i
don't
think
has
made
such
standard.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
purpose
of
1927.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
you
can't
--
you
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
you
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
right.
and
--
and
you're
mixing
apples
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
and
oranges.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes,
if
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir,
because
of
the
--
the
language
of
1927
and
--
and
the
consideration
of
its
interrelationship
with
1920
and
1923.
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mentioned
the
--
the
award
of
--
of
fees
for
frivolous
appeal.
i
think
that's
established
by
specific
statute.
in
this
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
40
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
46
u.s.
--
i
mean
the
rule
46,
i
believe
with
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
thus
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
--
certainly,
the
--
the
courts
have
--
have
awarded
attorney's
fees
against
parties
as
part
of
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
i
--
there've
been
no
--
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
roadway
have
reached
that
result.
i
suppose
that
you
could
discipline
lawyers
with
--
by
contempt
that
certainty,
that's
--
but
that's
--
that's
not
what
we
have
here,
your
honors.
the
--
the
final
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
it's
in
the
conduct
of
the
litigation
is
what
the
19
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
assuming
that
--
that
the
claim
had
no
merit
to
begin
with.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
under
those
facts
which
i
don't
think
are
applicable
is
here,
i
--
i
think
that
1927
would
probably
reach
that
--
that
conduct.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
would.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
because
i
think
it
--
that
because
of
the
--
of
the
relationship
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
it
is
not
in
1927
and
when
you
look
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
they're
on
the
same
chapter.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
123
and
whatever
it
is.
yes,
sir.
you
--
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
well,
you
got
--
you
--
i
think
you
have
to
read
it
with
the
--
looking
at
what
congress
intended.
and
--
and
that
one
of
the
things
you
consider
is
the
--
the
location
and
is
that
nearest,
you
know
the
definition
of
the
cost
within
that
particular
chapter.
one
--
one
of
those
things
i
would
like
to
mention
as
to
the
award
by
the
district
court
of
$17,000
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
the
fifth
circuit's
remand
was
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
costs
should
be
awarded
under
1927.
mr.
herschel
e.
richard,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
their
reading
--
that's
the
course
reading
of
1927.
