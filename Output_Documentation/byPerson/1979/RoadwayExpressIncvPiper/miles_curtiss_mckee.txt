mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
it
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
on
appeal.
the
issue
is
whether
attorneys
who
multiplied
proceedings
in
an
action
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
42
u.s.c.
1981
and
thereby
unreasonably
and
vexatiously
increased
the
cost,
maybe
personally
assessed
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
1927,
with
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
the
excess
cost
incurred
by
an
opposing
party
as
a
result
of
such
conduct.
the
case
originated
in
the
western
district
of
louisiana
where
it
was
dismissed
without
prejudice
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
the
plaintiffs
to
answer
the
defendant's
interrogatories
and
ordered
by
the
court,
the
failure
of
the
plaintiff
to
produce
one
of
the
plaintiffs
for
deposition,
the
general
failure
to
prosecute
the
suit
and
ultimately,
the
plaintiffs'
abandonment
of
their
claim.
the
court
after
the
dismissal
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
matter
of
the
assessment
of
cost
at
which
the
lawyers
for
the
plaintiffs
were
represented
by
their
malpractice
carrier,
the
court
awarded
fees
as
cost
pursuant
to
1927
and
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
title
vii
and
section
1988.
it
allowed
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
the
cost.
and
in
the
case
of
hutto
versus
finney
decided
by
this
court
in
1978,
that
taxable
cost
were
equated
with
attorney's
fees
under
42
u.s.c.
1988.
our
argument
to
the
court
is
plain
and
simple
because
we're
allowed
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutes.
and
where
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutes
is
--
is
present,
there
is
no
construction
necessary.
the
fifth
circuit
court
said
that
you
could
not
combine
these
statutes,
42
u.s.c.
1988
and
title
vii
and
1927
on
the
other
hand,
that
you
could
not
compel
them
to
achieve
what
the
fifth
circuit
called
a
hybrid
result.
the
court
of
appeals
did
this
without
any
explanation,
without
any
discussion
of
the
in
pari
materia
relationship
of
these
statutes
and
without
explaining
away
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
without
pointing
to
any
absurd,
futile
or
unreasonable
result.
so
where
are
cost
defined
for
a
determination
under
section
1927?
it
must
rely
on
other
statutes
for
its
definition.
and
upon
which
statutes
may
it
rely?
the
united
states
and
the
respondents
say
that
it
may
rely
on
only
two
statutes
and
that's
28
u.s.c.
1920
and
1923.
they
admit
that
section
1927
must
resort
mechanically
to
other
statutes
for
its
definition,
but
they
draw
a
barrier
at
the
resort
to
title
vii
and
section
1988.
the
respondent
in
the
amici
government
don't
demonstrate
any
statutory
or
other
limitation
on
section
1927's
access
to
title
vii
and
section
1988
for
the
definition
of
cost.
there
is
nothing
in
any
statute
to
prohibit
this
access
to
these
statutes
for
cost.
and
neither
the
respondent,
nor
the
united
states
or
any
of
the
amici
in
this
case
assailed
the
bare
language
of
the
statute.
their
efforts
are
devoted
to
unsubstantiated,
unsupported
speculation
and
postulation
on
which
they
offer
no
cases
and
no
authority.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
your
honor,
we
could
agree
with
it
for
the
purposes
of
argument.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
well,
your
honor
there
is
authority
saying
that
such
statutes
are
penal
as
to
one
group
of
people
and
not
penal
as
to
others
and
their
remedial
as
to
others.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
no,
it's
not.
circuit
courts
are,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
no,
sir.
1927
now,
is
the
one
that
shift
the
cost
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
well,
your
honor
there
is
some
legislative
history
that
says
that
it's
against
the
party.
the
actual
language
of
title
vii
and
the
actual
language
of
42
u.s.c.
1988
are
that
the
awards
of
the
cost
are
to
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
normally,
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
normally,
the
statute
deal
in
terms
of
parties
and
they
don't
deal
in
terms
of
lawyers
per
se.
1927
is
a
special
statute
dealing
with
lawyers
themselves
for
the
proscribed
conduct
that's
described
in
1927.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
we
have
done
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes
they
have,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes.
1920
--
section
1927
must
derive
its
cost
definition
from
some
other
statutes.
everybody
agrees
on
that.
everybody
agrees
that
you
must
go
to
1920
and
1923
to
get
anything
at
all,
that
you're
going
to
pop
in
a
1927
to
make
it
make
any
sense.
but
title
vii
and
section
1988
are
also
cost-defining
statutes.
and
there
are
at
least
--
other
than
those
two,
there
are
least
34
others.
there's
nothing
about
the
language
of
any
of
those
statutes
that
prohibits
their
application
to
section
1927.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
1927
cost
from
including
attorney's
fees
at
--
dictated
by
these
statutes.
we
also
maintain
before
the
court
that
the
bad
faith
exception
to
the
american
rule
supports
this
award.
the
same
shifting
process
is
available.
the
client
is
responsible
under
the
wabash
or
link
and
wabash
doctrine.
and
section
1927
would
shift
such
an
award
to
the
lawyer
given
the
proper
finding.
our
position
before
the
court
on
the
policy
aspects
of
it
is
--
is
that
the
policy
of
all
of
these
statutes
are
and
meritorious
suits
will
be
expeditiously
conducted
by
competent
counsels
of
impeccable
integrity
strictly
on
the
issues
and
nothing
that
we
suggest
is
alien
to
that
policy,
whatever.
if
the
court
please,
with
our
argument
relying
upon
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
such
as
it
is,
we
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
if
there
are
no
questions
for
rebuttal.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
your
honor,
he
allowed
them
in
total.
there
were
some
adjustments
made
to
them,
but
it's
--
as
a
practical
matter,
he
allowed
them
in
total
because
he
considered
that
the
suit
was
improvidently
brought
from
the
very
beginning
and
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
these
lawyers.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
--
that
the
decision
may
be
read
that
he
felt
that
the
lawyers
were
completely
responsible
for
this
situation.
and
i
might
add
in
--
in
his
finding
that
he
found
that
--
that
these
lawyers
had
taken
advantage
of
three
unfortunate
clients
and
that
they
had
enlarged
upon
their
claims
and
to
the
extent
that
if
--
if
you
can
attribute
that
from
the
very
beginning,
i
think
the
decision
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
i
don't
think
you
can
read
it
any
other
way.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
the
entire
thrust
of
the
decision,
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
matter
from
the
very
beginning,
one
of
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
i
don't
think
it
goes
quite
as
far
at
bad
faith,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
certainly
abusive
of
the
process
of
the
court.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
no,
i
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
well,
your
honor,
preceding
everything
in
all
of
these
things,
i
understand
this
court
decision
in
christiansburg.
that
christiansburg
did
not
dictate
under
what
standards
all
of
these
things
should
be
allowed.
the
only
thing
that
christiansburg
said
and
the
only
thing
that
i
think
this
court
had
ever
said
about
these
standards,
are
that
these
are
guidelines
for
the
judge's
discretion.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
and
if
so,
discretion
must
who
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
your
honor,
if
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
what
the
court
called
a
proper
award,
what
we
construe
that
to
mean
and
my
brother
on
the
side,
mr.
richard
and
i
have
entered
into
a
stipulation
as
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
is
that
the
purpose
on
that
was
to
remove
the
attorney's
fees
from
the
award.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes,
i
think
it
does,
sir.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
that's
what
they
said.
yes,
sir.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
--
it's
difficult
for
me
to
follow
it.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
want
to
eliminate
the
possibility
that
that
may
happen.
that's
mr.
justice
white's
question.
if
this
court
should
feel
that
he
had
overstepped
his
bounds
to
the
extent
that
he
had
awarded
too
much
or
that
he
did
not
find
the
point
at
which
the
excess
cost
began.
and
obviously,
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
with
instructions
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
with
those
instructions.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
your
honor,
that's
correct.
they
did
not
reach
the
question.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
it's
definitely
established
in
the
fifth
circuit
decision
that
there's
no
question,
but
that
the
proceedings
were
multiplied
and
that
the
conduct
fitted
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
yes,
sir.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
that's
correct.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
that's
correct.
well,
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
earlier
about
the
matter
of
improvident
appeals
and
--
and
awards
under
inherent
powers.
it's
a
strange
result,
but
on
april
the
2nd,
the
fifth
circuit
decided
a
case
called,
a
panel
decision.
decided
case
called
self
versus
self,
which
is
cited
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
in
which
they've
suggested
that
an
award
for
just
such
a
reason
might
be
made
under
1927.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
question
of
penal
at
--
our
position
is
simply
that
where
these
statutes
are
as
clear
as
they
are
that
there
is
no
construction
needed
and
whether
you
admit
even
if
you
admit
--
admitted
completely
that
they
might
be
penal
that
it
doesn't
change
the
result
that
we're
contending
for.
if
you
follow
the
argument
of
the
government,
you
must
say
that
congress
was
not
aware
of
1920
or
1923
when
it
passed
the
42
c
1988
or
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
has
the
effect
of
ignoring
one
of
the
cases
that
they've
cited
which
is
erlenbaugh
decided
by
the
court
in
1972,
holding
that
congress
is
presumed
to
be
aware
that
all
previous
statutes
on
the
same
subject.
or
should
we
presume
that
congress
was
aware
of
1920
and
1923
and
intended
something
entirely
different
by
the
use
of
the
phrase,
“as
a
part
of
the
cost”.
congress
has
from
to
time
used
various
phrases
to
define
cost.
in
17
statutes,
they've
separated
them
as
cost
and
attorney's
fees.
in
five,
they
have
used
the
language,
“together
with.”
in
21
statutes
they
have
used
"cost
including
attorney's
fees"
and
in
15
statutes,
one
of
--
the
ones
that
we're
involved
with
today,
they
used
"cost
as
a
part
of".
the
simple
meaning
of
all
of
these
is
that
these
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
the
taxable
cost
in
these
cases
in
hutto
and
finney,
foreclosed
any
further
discussion
of
that.
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
--
on
the
merit
conduct
distinction
that
has
been
advanced
here.
and
that
is
that
it's
a
very
mechanistic
argument
which
divides
the
lawyer
and
his
client
and
which
divides
the
suit
into
two
parts.
and
that
it's
--
assigns
if
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
it
does,
your
honor,
for
the
purpose
of
the
discretion
to
the
court,
yes.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
you
could,
sir.
in
other
words
if
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
that's
correct.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
well,
they
are,
your
honor,
but
you
can't
divide
them
entirely
for
all
of
these
purposes
and
ignore
the
lincoln
wabash
decision
at
all
--
all
together.
but
what
they've
done
is
they've
created
a
factious
distinction
here,
where
they
divide
the
suit
down
the
middle
and
they
assigned
the
lawyer
one
side
of
the
suit
and
they
assigned
the
client
the
other
side.
to
wit,
“the
bringing
of
the
suit
is
the
client's
responsibility.
the
conduct
of
the
suit
is
that
of
the
lawyer.”
they
applied
title
vii
to
the
front
side
of
that
argument
and
1927
to
the
backside
of
it.
and
they
are
never
to
be
met
again
according
to
the
argument
as
it
goes.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
self.
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
a
case
that
--
that
[laughs]
was
a
domestic
relations
case
and
somehow
in
order
to
get
appeal,
got
removed
and
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
--
it
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
justice
--
judge
clark
who
was
writing
for
the
panel,
suggested
that
the
--
the
fees
for
the
frivolous
appeals
should
be
assessed
against
the
lawyer
in
the
1927.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
there's
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
--
that
--
that
this
thing
can
be
applied
to
everyone
who's
involved
in
the
litigation.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
not
at
all.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
not
at
all.
mr.
miles
curtiss
mckee
now,
these
--
these
offenses
which
seemed
to
be
--
they
come
through
the
argument
of
the
government.
they
seem
to
come
from
somewhere
else
and
they
are
really
self-made.
the
lawyer
himself
puts
himself
in
this
position.
they
don't
come
from
outside
and
we're
not
singling
out
anybody.
what
the
people
that
are
singled
out
were
singled
out
by
congress
when
they
passed
these
statutes
that
said
that
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
the
cost
or
the
cost
includes
attorney's
fees.
there
is
no
singling
except
to
the
extent
that
some
36
or
so
statutes
that
deal
in
those
terms.
i
think
that
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
will
give
up.
thank
you,
sir.
