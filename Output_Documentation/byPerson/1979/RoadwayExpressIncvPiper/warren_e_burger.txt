we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
roadway
express
against
monk.
mr.
mckee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
was
part
of
the
theory
that
--
that
the
client
should
not
be
penalized
for
the
conduct
of
the
lawyer
when
the
client
is
not
in
as
good
a
position
to
evaluate
the
technique
as
the
lawyer
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
have
--
have
the
courts
not
done
that
with
for
example,
frivolous
appeals
without
any
statutory
authority
under
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
protect
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
its
operations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hope
they
have
it
because
we've
done
it
from
bench
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
circuit
where
there
was
a
frivolous
appeal
and
we
ordered
the
payment
by
the
lawyer
and
not
by
the
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
in
effect,
you
were
saying
the
entire
proceeding
was
unreasonable
and
vexatious.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
their
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
therefore,
their
--
do
you
read
--
the
district
judge
is
saying
there
was
no
occasion
to
--
to
try
to
divide
or
allocate
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
attempt
to
be
more
than
an
unfortunate.
this
had
to
be
--
that
had
unreasonably
increased
the
costs
and
it
was
vexatious.
in
other
words,
it
was
--
they
don't
use
the
term,
frivolous,
but
this
--
isn't
there
some
concept
of
abuse
of
the
processes
of
the
court
implicit
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
--
if
we
thought
the
district
court
had
overreached
a
little
bit
on
the
exercise
of
this
--
this
discussion.
we
--
we
might
conceivably
say
you
went
too
far
when
you
allocated
all
these
costs.
well,
that's
such
possible,
but
your
position
is
i
take
it
that
he
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
and
that
there
should
be
an
outright
reversal
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
richard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
may
just
you
meant
for
frivolous
appeal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
one
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
absent
any
rule
or
statute
to
a
good
many
courts
have
treated
that
as
an
inherent
power
close
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
state
and
federal,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
talking
about
an
attorney's
fees
against
the
lawyer
as
distinguished
from
the
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mckee,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
--
it's
not
1927
to
divide
the
lawyer
from
his
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
1927,
could
the
strictures
of
1927
be
applied
against
the
lawyer
for
the
prevailing
party?
suppose
the
defendant
in
a
given
suit
prevails,
but
the
court
concludes
that
all
through
the
litigation,
the
defense
counsel
has
used
these
tactics
that
are
proscribed
multiplying
the
proceedings
--
a
rearguard
action,
making
it
as
difficult
as
possible
all
the
way.
but
on
the
merits,
the
defendant
finally
prevails?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
way
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he's
a
prevailing
party
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
losing
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted,
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
