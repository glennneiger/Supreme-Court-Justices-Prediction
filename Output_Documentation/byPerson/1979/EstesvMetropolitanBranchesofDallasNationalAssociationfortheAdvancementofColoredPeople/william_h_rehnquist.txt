william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that
the
only
cure
for
a
system-wide
violation
is
bussing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
minority
students,
does
that
include
mexican-american?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
district
court
have
some
discretion
when
it
comes
to
very
young
children
in
saying
there
shall
be
less
bussing
with
respect
to
them
than
with
respect
to
older
children?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cunningham,
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
was
bound
to
adopt
the
plan
which
in
your
words
most
desegregated
the
school
district
of
the
ones
submitted
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
had
what,
was
it
five
or
six
plans
submitted
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
he
was
obligated
to
adopt,
of
those
six,
the
one
which
most
desegregated
the
school
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
finding
on
page
34a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
district
court's
opinion
of,
i
think
it's
march
1976;
"moreover,
this
court
must
adopt
the
plan
which
promises
to
be
effective
in
eliminating
the
vestiges
of
the
dual
system.
the
court
is
convinced
that
the
magnet
school
concept
on
the
9
to
12
grade
level
will
be
more
effective
than
the
assignment
of
students
to
achieve
a
certain
percentage
of
each
race
in
each
high
school.
the
court
tried
this
method
of
student
assignment
in
1971
and
it
has
not
proved
wholly
successful."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
least
the
district
court
did
make
a
finding
that
the
magnet
school
system
would
be
more
effective
than
the
transportation
and
assigning
students
on
a
racial
basis
to
high
schools.
now,
if
he
was
wrong
on
the
record,
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
have
reversed
him,
rather
than
just
saying
we
need
more
findings?
