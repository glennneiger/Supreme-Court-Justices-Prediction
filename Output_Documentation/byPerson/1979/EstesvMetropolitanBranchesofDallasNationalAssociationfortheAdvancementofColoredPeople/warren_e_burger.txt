we

the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
whitham,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
your
convenience,
mr.
whitham,
and
perhaps
your
friends
will
comment
on
the
same,
first
this
case
is
here
now
because
we
have
granted
the
writ,
but
are
there
any
issues
in
this
case
that
could
not
have
been
resolved
after
the
district
courts
have
carried
out
the
remand
directions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
the
district
court
conducts
its
time
and
distance
studies,
won't
the
court
of
appeals
have
a
different
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.

very
well,
mr.
whitham.
mr.
blumenthal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
your
reference
to
what,
at
least
i
thought
you
suggested
was
a
holding
concerning
bussing
in
swann,
the
opinion
states,
"no
rigid
guidelines
as
to
student
transportation
can
be
given
for
application
to
the
infinite
variety
of
problems
presented
in
thousands
of
situations."
thus
transportation
has
been
a
part
of
public
education
for
years.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
this
is
merely
one
of
the
permissible
tools,
not
a
mandated
tool
in
every
case,
by
any
means.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wasn't
it
the
finding
in
the
detroit
case
that
--
undisputed
finding
--
that
the
proportion
of
students
in
the
so-called
one-race
schools
was
greater
than
you
have
here,
and
that
the
number
of
one-race
schools,
just
counting
the
schools,
was
greater
than
you
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
have
you
thought
about
the
question
i
put
to
your
friend?
is
there
anything
before
the
court
now
which
couldn't
be
resolved,
even
though
at
a
later
date,
after
the
district
court
acts
on
the
remand?
chief
justice
warren
e.

didn't
swann
--
chief
justice

e.

didn't
swann
say
precisely
that,
mr.

with
young
children,
there
was
to
be
a
different
approach
with
younger
children?

well,
mr.
