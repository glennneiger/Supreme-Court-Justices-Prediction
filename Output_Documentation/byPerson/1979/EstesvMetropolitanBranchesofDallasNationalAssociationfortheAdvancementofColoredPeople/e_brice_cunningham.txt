mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
naacp,
it
is
the
naacp's
position
that
this
is
a
dual
segregated
de
jure
system
that
has
never
been
desegregated,
and
that
it
is
not
desegregated
by
the
student
assignment
plan
that
was
adopted
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
district
judge
in
1975,
directing
that
district
judge
specifically
to
this
court's
holding
in
swann
and
directing
that
district
judge
to
use
the
tools
and
techniques
set
out
in
swann.
the
reason
the
naacp
submit
that
this
student
assignment
plan
does
not
desegregate
the
dallas
independent
school
district
is,
one,
the
exclusion
of
high
school
students
9
dash
12
from
inclusion
in
this
student
assignment
plan;
two,
the
number
of
one-race
schools
that
were
left
one-race
without
any
justification,
the
naacp
submits;
three,
the
exclusion
of
kindergarten
dash
third
grade
students
from
inclusion
in
the
plan;
and
four,
the
creation
of
an
all-black
district
which
was
totally
written
off
by
the
district
judge
below,
locking
in
more
than
26,000
students
with
the
only
method
of
getting
out
of
that
all-black
district
using
a
transfer
form,
that
is
that
they
themselves
either
opt
out
by
magnet
concept,
attending
a
magnet
school,
or
majority
to
minority
transfers.
we
submit,
the
naacp
submits
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
correct
in
remanding
this
case
back
to
the
district
judge
for
additional
findings,
and
the
naacp
would
submit
that
this
was
a
very
moderate
order,
and
when
you
look
at
the
order
entered
by
the
5th
circuit
in
this
case,
and
specifically
moderate
when
you
compare
it
with
the
order
that
was
rendered
by
this
same
court
in
this
same
case
in
july
of
1975,
when
it
specifically
directed
the
district
judge
to
utilize
the
tools
that
this
court
set
out
in
swann,
and
that
this
school
district
has
never
fully
utilized,
and
further
went
on
to
tell
that
district
judge
to
do
it
by
the
second
semester
or
second
term
of
the
1975-76
school
year,
which
was
not
done.
addressing
myself
to
the
four
glaring
errors
that
the
naacp
submits
that
clearly
indicates
that
this
student
assignment
plan
does
not
comply
with
this
court's
ruling
in
swann
is
the
exclusion
of
the
high
school
students
9
dash
12,
which
in
effect
is
a
neighborhood
concept
for
these
high
school
students,
and
with
the
indication
that
the
only
method
of
desegregating
these
high
school
students
was
a
magnet
concept.
they
have
six
magnet
high
schools
plus
skyline.
the
magnet
concept
has
been
a
failure
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
less
than
2,500
students
are
enrolled
in
the
magnet
concepts
right
now.
at
the
time,
in
1976,
there
were
approximately
3,500.
the
magnet
concept
has
failed.
the
other
two
referred
to
by
the
district
judge
for
the
desegregation
of
the
high
school
students
nine
dash
12,
the
majority
to
minority
transfer,
is
a
failure
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
1,403
students
out
of
a
total
population
of
better
than
131,000
have
taken
advantage
of
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
program,
and
96
percent
of
those
were
black.
therefore,
with
respect
to
the
high
school
students
9
dash
12,
the
naacp
submits
that
there
is
no
effective
desegregation
in
accordance
with
this
court's
holding
in
swann.
the
second
point,
the
number
of
one-race
schools
left
in
this
district,
approximately
76
out
of
a
total
of
177,
at
the
time
that
this
order
was
entered
48
of
those
schools
were
negro
schools;
25
of
those
schools
were
anglo
schools.
at
the
present
time
there
are
76
one-race
schools
still
existing
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
62
of
those
schools
are
black
schools,
and
to
that
you
add
14
combined,
and
you
have,
you
come
up
with
76
one-race
schools
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
that
there
was
no
factual
finding,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
simply
rely
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
a
large
number
of
one-race
schools.
it
went
on
to
say
in
its
opinion,
and
address
itself
to
the
high
school
question.
the
third
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
there
are
28
one-race
schools
in
the
east
oak
cliff.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
28.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
the
rest
are
in
the
other
four
sub-districts
that
were
created
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
28
in
east
oak
cliff
sub-district.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
there
are
a
total
of
62
one-race
schools.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
there
are
52
one-race
schools,
black
schools;
9
one-race
anglo
schools;
and
1
mexican-american
one-race
school
existing
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
in
the
east
oak
cliff
area.
the
remaining
all-negro
schools
are
outside
of
the
east
oak
cliff
area.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
the
student
assignment
plan
also
in
excluding
kindergarten
dash
3,
the
naacp
submits
that
there
were
no
factual
findings
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
these
students
from
inclusion
in
the
plan.
there
were
no
indications
by
the
district
judge.
there
were
other
plans
that
were
submitted.
the
naacp
submitted
a
plan
that
would
have
desegregated
dallas.
plaintiff's
plan
a
would
have
desegregated
dallas
more
than
the
plan
that
was
adopted
by
the
district
judge
below.
the
court
even
appointed
a
court-appointed
expert
who
submitted
a
plan,
and
that
plan
was
not
even
adopted
by
the
district
judge
below.
and
that
plan
of
the
court-appointed
expert
used
part
of
the
east
oak
cliff
in
attempting
to
desegregate
dallas,
make
dallas
come
in
compliance
with
swann.
and
then
the
last
point
-
the
creation
of
this
all-black
district.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
i
think
that
the
district
judge
under
this
court's
holding
had
a
duty
to
adopt
the
plan
that
desegregated
dallas
and
utilizing
the
tools
in
swann.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
he
had
six
plans
submitted
to
him.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
he
was
obligated
to
so
adopt
the
plan
that
most
desegregated
dallas.
it
is
the
naacp's
position
that
he
did
not
adopt
the
plan
that
most
desegregated
dallas,
but
that
the
plan
that
was
adopted
continued
the
dual
school
system
that
had
existed
from
the
time
of
brown
1
and
brown
2
up
to
the
present
time,
and
as
it
exists
right
now.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
i
have
read
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
we
support
--
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
if
i
understand,
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
dealing
with
dallas,
and
--
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
the
present
decision
rests
upon
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
below's
decision
rests
upon
this
court's
holdings,
in
brown
1,
2,
green,
and
particularly
swann,
because
on
--
this
is
the
second
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed
this
district
judge
to
look
at
the
tools
set
out
by
this
court
in
swann
and
to
apply
those
tools
and
techniques
to
the
desegregation
of
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
i
think
that
he
may
take
that
into
account,
but
i
think
that
the
naacp's
position
is
that
still
taking
that
into
consideration,
his
first
consideration,
the
first
consideration
are
the
minority
children
that
are
being
desegregated,
and
seeing
that
their
constitutional
rights
are
protected
and
guaranteed,
and
that
is
what
the
naacp
says
was
not
done.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
the
naacp
would
still
be
arguing
the
same
position
that
it's
arguing
now
and
that
it
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
in
the
district
court.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that
is
speculation.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
that
is
the
district
judge's
finding
based
upon
speculation,
but
we
have
here
a
plan
in
effect
which
shows
that
the
student
enrollment
is
constant,
that
all
that
there
has
been,
and
no
white
--
well,
white
flight,
as
this
court
said
in
swann,
should
not
be,
or
should
not
be
a
reason
for
denying
minority
children
their
right
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
constitution.
mr.
e.
brice
cunningham
that
is
the
extent
of
their
right,
mr.
justice
stewart,
sir.
