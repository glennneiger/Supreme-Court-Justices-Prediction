mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case,
does
the
constitution
mandate
forced
transportation
of
students
in
the
previously
segregated
state
school
system
where
private
housing
patterns
are
racially
imbalanced,
is
one
that
concerns
curry.
the
court
has
previously
answered
that
question
yes,
and
it
has
done
it
on
two
assumptions.
one,
it
is
assumed
that
because
there
was
once
state-enforced
segregation
it
somehow
happened
to
create
the
racial
imbalance
which
exists
in
the
housing
pattern,
and
the
second
is
the
assumption
that
once
that
imbalance
is
created,
the
school
system
can
remedy
it.
it
is
curry's
position
that
both
of
those
assumptions
are
false.
in
this
case,
both
of
those
assumptions
have
been
held
by
the
district
court
as
a
fact
not
to
have
existed.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
private
housing
patterns
which
caused
the
racial
imbalance,
not
anything
that
was
ever
done
by
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
and
indeed,
the
experience
of
dallas
post
1965,
during
the
time
that
the
court
was
mandating
all
student
assignments,
would
amply
indicate
that
that
finding
is
true
and
is
based
on
the
evidence.
during
that
period
there
was
a
fluid
movement
of
schools
that
went
from
all
white
to
all
black.
in
1971,
children
were
bussed
from
south
oak
cliff
high
school,
an
all-black
school,
to
carter
high
school,
a
predominantly
white
school.
in
1976
the
effort
was
how
to
relieve
carter
high
school,
which
was
then
a
some
75
or
80
percent
black
school
from
its
predominantly
minority
status.
but
in
1965
when
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
a
racially
neutral
school
policy,
south
oak
cliff
was
an
all-white
school.
the
shifting
populations,
the
integration
of
the
city,
is
a
whole
different
thing;
you
are
dealing
with
a
different
problem
than
was
dealt
with
in
the
fifties
or
the
post-brown
in
the
period
of
school
districts
attempting
to
maintain
segregation.
but
even
more
vividly
pointed
out
is
the
false
assumption
that
the
school
district
can
remove
one-race
schools.
in
city
after
city
after
city
circuit
courts
and
indeed
this
court
have
ordered
school
districts
to
racially
change
the
makeup
of
their
cities.
you've
asked
them
to
eliminate
one-race
schools.
you
might
as
well
ask
these
to
nail
currant
jelly
to
the
wall,
because
they've
been
unable
to
do
it
unless
you
concede,
unless
you
believe
that
detroit
has
succeed
in
eliminating
one-race
schools,
or
cleveland,
or
oakland,
or
kansas
city,
or
atlanta,
or
the
district
of
columbia.
if
that's
the
perception
of
having
eliminated
the
one-race
school,
then
perhaps
it's
possible.
but
in
fact
what
has
happened
in
case
after
case
after
case,
and
what
has
happened
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district,
is
that
every
attempt
by
the
district
court
and
every
attempt
by
a
school
district
to
mandate
student
assignment,
to
force
transport,
to
rearrange
the
school
district,
has
met
with
a
minority
isolated
district
itself,
one
in
which
any
hope
for
integrated
education
dies,
and
one
ultimately
that
loses
the
community
support
so
vital
to
a
school
district.
in
this
case
we
have
testimony
from
dr.
coleman,
who
you
know
is
the
noted
sociologist,
the
father
of
the
coleman
report,
the
authority
on
school
segregation,
the
one
who
wrote
the
report
in
1960,
that
the
result
of
this
type
of
transportation
will
ultimately
be
a
resegregated
district.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
our
basic
position,
sir,
is
to
reverse
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
to
tell
the
district
court
that
if
it
finds
discrimination,
remove
it.
if
there
is
something
that
it
can
remedy,
remedy
it,
but
it
is
under
no
requirement
by
the
constitution,
the
14th
amendment
does
not
mandate
the
transportation
of
children
in
a
formerly
state
segregated
school
unless
there
is
some
discrimination
that
is
being
remedied
in
particular.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
but,
sir,
you've
also
imposed
a
presumption
that
any
formerly
state
segregated
school
has
had
a
system-wide
violation,
and
a
system-wide
violation
calls
for
a
system-wide
remedy,
and
the
only
system-wide
remedy
is
forced
transportation.
and
if
you
would
make
it
clear
to
a
district
court
and
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
quit
reversing,
just
because
you
haven't,
quote,
"bussed
enough."
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
because
that's
the
only
cure
that
the
fifth
circuit
certainly
has
indicated
is
appropriate.
every
other
account
in
the
first
hearing,
there
was
television,
there
was
majority
and
minority,
there
were
all
of
the
various
--
magnet
schools
--
all
of
the
panoply
of
efforts
to
integrate
schools,
and
the
fifth
circuit
rigidly
reversed
and
said,
"you
haven't
made
constitutional
muster,
see
swann
and
the
remedies
prescribed
in
swann,"
again
with
bussing,
with
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
beg
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
reading
by
the
district
courts
certainly,
if
you
read
his
record,
read
his
statements
to
counsel,
he
is
saying
i
am
mandated
to
bus
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that's
really
the
only
fair
reading
of
the
1976
opinion.
it's
the
only
fair
reading,
i
believe,
of
the
1975
opinion,
and
the
only
really
fair
reading
of
the
1976
opinion,
which
is
more
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
the
last
decree
i
believe
mandated
the
bussing
of
some
17
to
20,000
of
whom
only
about
10,000
are
still
in
the
school
district.
the
rest
of
them
have
disappeared.
20
percent
of
the
blacks
who
were
to
be
bussed
have
disappeared.
the
middle
class
opts
out
of
the
system,
black
or
white.
it's
not
a
purely
racial
thing.
but
the
circuit
court
has
said
eliminate
one-race
schools,
and
the
only
way
they
can
suppose
that
you
can
eliminate
one-race
schools
is
to
force
assigned
students.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
the
district
court
only
has
41,000
anglo
students
left,
and
they
cannot
be
distributed
around
the
district
like
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
well,
the
district
court's
decree
in
making
its
forced
assignments
has
now
removed
us
from
a
57,000
anglo
student
to
41,
and
the
continuation
of
that
decree
is
going
to
ultimately
bring
this
into
a
racially
isolated
district
in
which
no
one
can
ever
achieve
the
benefits
of
an
integrated
education.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
well,
it
was
predicted
precisely
by
the
witnesses
that
curry
produced.
dr.
armour
predicted
the
precise
continuation
if
a
plan
was
adopted
similar
to
the
one
the
court
adopted,
he
predicted
the
precise
ratios
to
which
the
student
assignment
would
drop.
coleman
says
the
same
thing.
every
district
has
had
the
same
experience.
leon
bessinger
talks
about
cognitive
dissidence
in
which
an
idea
devoutly
held
is
not
abandoned
even
when
evidence
that
it
fails
is
produced.
he
uses
an
example,
the
court
will
recall,
adventists
who
predicted
the
end
of
the
world
on
a
certain
day,
and
the
world
didn't
end
on
that
day
and
the
people
became
more
fervently
convinced
than
before
that
their
theory
was
right
and
the
world
would
come
to
an
end
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
no,
that
it
would
end.
they
picked
another
day.
they
said
more
bussing
will
get
us
there.
just
because
the
bussing
that
we've
done
to
date
hasn't
worked,
obviously
we
need
more.
obviously
we
need
to
go
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
court
was
not
in
error
in
light
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
it's
our
position
that
the
fifth
circuit
continually
ordering
the
district
court
to
continue
to
bus,
in
spite
of
whatever
the
court
finds,
that's
the
error.
it
is
our
position,
curry's
position,
that
if
the
district
court
were
instructed
to
use
whatever
tools
to
desegregate
it
chose
to
use,
but
it
did
not
have
to
use
forced
transportation
if
it
felt
like
it
was
not
productive
--
remember,
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
then
i
think
curry
would
be,
if
you
could
say
you
don't
have
to
bus,
curry
would
be
pleased
with
the
result.
that's
the
position
we
urge
that
the
constitution
permits.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
permissible
only
to
remedy
some
discriminatory
purpose,
but
not
mandatory,
and
you
don't
have
to
remove
one-race
schools
unless
those
one-race
schools
were
found
to
have
been
caused
by
the
disd.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
now,
remember,
the
district
court
found
that
in
1971,
i
bussed
1,000
children
to
the
high
schools
of
which
50
were
still
here
in
1976,
five
years
later.
the
courts
concluded
from
that,
the
district
court,
that
it
does
not
work,
but
no
one
is
going
to
permit
that
district
court's
conclusion
to
stand
up.
and
what
about
those
thousand
students?
why
don't
they
count
in
relieving.
they're
gone
now,
but
under
pasadena
they've
been
assigned
to
those
school
districts;
why
don't
they
count
as
people,
although
not
present,
who
have
integrated
a
one-race
black
school?
they
were
assigned
to
the
school
by
the
district
and
through
no
act
of
the
district
as
found
by
the
district
court,
they're
gone.
staring
all
of
this
in
the
face,
too,
is
to
what
end?
for
whose
purpose
are
we
changing
the
school
districts
into
minority
isolated
school
districts?
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
it
certainly
is
not,
and
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
no,
you
don't
need
to
ban
it
if
you
tell
the
district
court
that
if
you
don't
think
this
is
going
to
work
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
in
some
circumstances,
but
only
if
it
has
some
prospect
of
working,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
yes,
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
in
fact
they
said
that
very
thing
in
lee
v.
macon
county
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
no,
sir,
but
they
did
say
that
we
think
the
swann
mandates
bussing,
even
though
we
know
it
will
not
desegregate.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
in
lee
v.
macon
county
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
beg
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
in
this
case
they
didn't
say
it.
they
just
kept
sending
it
back,
saying
get
rid
of
one-race
schools,
as
if
there
was
some
power
that
the
district
court
had.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
the
lee
v.
macon
county,
it's
in
our
--
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
it's
in
our
brief;
yes,
sir.
it's
465
fed.
2d
369
at
370.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
on
the
basis
of
this
record
with
no
discrimination
to
be
remedied,
yes,
sir,
because
we
agreed
on
a
majority-minority
school
district,
we've
agreed
on
it,
the
community
is
supporting
it
--
look
at
the
high
schools
which
are
today
neighborhood
high
schools
with
majority
to
minority;
set
out
in
our
brief
is
a
racial
breakdown
of
those
high
schools.
look
in
the
pink
brief.
look
at
those
racial
high
schools
and
tell
me
if
that's
not
unitary
school
system.
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
those.
it
was
very
close,
by
the
way,
to
the
racial
makeup
of
the
school
district
before
the
courts
began
to
ship
children
around,
but
it's
now
very
far
out
of
whack
as
to
the
racial
makeup
of
the
district
because
95,000
anglos
is
now
42,000
anglos
and
sinking
at
about
7
or
8
percent
of
that
population
a
year.
and
you
can't
integrate
if
you
don't
have
children.
if
this
was
an
isolated,
if
dallas
was
the
only
city
in
the
nation
that
this
was
true
of,
then
perhaps
you
could
talk
about
dallas.
but
dallas
has
been
a
model
for
a
system
in
which
the
community
has
gone
together
to
work
or
to
achieve
a
desegregation
plan
and
it
didn't
work
there,
and
it
hasn't
worked
anywhere.
mr.
robert
l.
blumenthal
but
the
5th
circuit
has
not
applied
it
in
that
way,
and
the
eloquence
of
turning
those
busses
around
that
were
used
to
segregate
to
use
to
desegregate
is
so
appealing,
and
yet
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
doesn't
work.
but
nonetheless,
the
circuit
court
keeps
requiring
the
district
court
to
achieve
it.
thank
you.
