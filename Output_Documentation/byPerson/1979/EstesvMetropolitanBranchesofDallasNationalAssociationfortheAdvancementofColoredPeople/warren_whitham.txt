mr.
warren
whitham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
school
desegregation
case
involving
the
dallas
independent
school
district
which
is
situated
primarily
in
the
city
of
dallas,
texas,
although
the
boundaries
are
not
coterminous.
involved
in
this
case
is
remedy
and
remedy
alone
with
respect
to
this
petitioner
which
i
will
hereinafter
refer
to
as
the
school
district.
the
estes
petitioners
are
the
school
district.
our
position
is
--
mr.
warren
whitham
there
is
a
great
issue
involved
here,
and
i
think
it
becomes
even
a
greater
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
view
of
this
court's
recent
opinions
in
columbus
and
dayton
of
last
july
which
in
effect
may
well
bring
all
of
us,
north
and
south,
east
and
west,
to
a
common
problem
if
de
jure
segregation
is
now
to
be,
in
effect,
arrived
at
either
by
old
state
law
or
constitution,
or
by
the
inability
to
overcome
presumptions
and
evidentiary
matters.
the
issue
here
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
return
to
your
question,
if
i
may,
whether
or
not
the
elimination
of
all
one
race
schools,
given
the
urban
condition
in
the
large
urban
school
district
described
by
the
courts
below
and
in
these
petitions,
is
the
controlling
factor
to
be
considered.
i
may
well
be
rising
to
ask
this
court
to
take
the
great
broad
principles
enunciated
in
swann,
perhaps
address
those
again,
perhaps
recognize
that
the
lower
courts
have
taken
those
principles
and
taken
the
tools
referred
to
in
that
case,
be
it
transportation,
attendant
zone
changes,
satelliting,
paring,
clustering,
to
address
the
question
of
whether
the
tools
discussed
have
somehow
or
other
been
elevated
to
the
principles
of
swann,
a
circumstance
that
i
would
respectfully
suggest
is
creating
untold
turmoil
for
the
district
courts
of
this
land
and
the
school
boards
of
this
land
in
trying
to
find
out
what
is
a
plan
that
would
ultimately
arrive
at
a
unitary
school
system.
the
district
court
in
this
case
formulated
a
plan
which
the
school
district
initially
opposed,
but
in
an
effort
to
get
out
of
court,
to
become
that
stranger
to
school
desegregation
proceedings
that
the
fifth
circuit
accuses
us
of
not
being,
the
school
board,
9
to
nothing,
has
voted
to
support
this
plan
of
the
district
court,
and
this
plan
was
remanded
by
the
fifth
circuit.
so
yes,
i
stand
here
readily
admitting
that
this
court
has
taken
a
case
where
technically
the
court
of
appeals
has
rejected
the
plan
and
this
school
district
is
here
urging
that
this
court
affirm
the
district
court's
plan
as
being
a
solution
for
public
education
in
the
urban
environment,
given
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
what
are
some
of
the
facts
that
bring
us
here,
this
long
history
they
speak
of
of
dallas
school
district
litigation?
and
before
i
get
into
that,
let
me
say,
remedy
is
all
that's
involved
--
i
want
to
emphasize
that
--
this
school
district
recognizes
it
is
located
in
a
state
that
by
state
constitution
required
separation
of
the
races.
this
school
district
recognizes
it
had
a
first
and
prior
desegregation
lawsuit
pending
against
it,
filed
in
1955
following
brown
ii.
it
had
a
history
in
the
courts
until
1965.
admittedly
through
that
plan
in
1967,
a
stair
step
plan
reached
its
final
implementation.
this
school
district
is
cognizant
of
this
court's
observations
concerning
stair
step
plans,
and
we
are
not
here
saying
that's
the
beginning
and
the
end,
and
that
we
should
not
still
be
searching
for
a
remedy,
in
view
of
prior
language
of
this
court,
concerning
stair
step
plans.
but
on
october
6,
1970,
a
new
plan
was
formulated
for
this
--
or
a
new
lawsuit,
a
new
school
desegregation
lawsuit
was
filed
by
separate
parties
representing
black
and
mexican-american
students.
in
this
lawsuit,
we
have
the
problem
of
formulating
now,
and
the
district
court
had
a
problem
of
formulating,
and
this
school
board
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
drafting
a
plan
that
had
these
difficult
components;
that
there
had
been
numerous
demographic
changes
partly
as
a
result
of
the
prior
desegregation
order
and
remedy.
it
is
now
a
minority
anglo
school
district,
and
a
tri-ethnic
remedy
is
required.
at
the
time
of
the
first
remedy
hearing
in
july
of
1971,
the
school
district
was
probably
59
percent
anglo
and
a
lesser
percent
black
and
mexican-american.
at
the
time
this
second
hearing
was
held
in
february
of
1976,
from
which
hearing
the
plan
now
before
this
court
came
about,
the
district
had
dropped
to
41
percent
anglo,
44.5
percent
black,
and
13.4
percent
mexican-american.
now,
the
first
appeal
in
the
july
of
'71
remedy
which
the
school
district
supported
--
the
school
district
supported
whatever
the
district
court
there
ordered
--
the
fifth
circuit
sent
it
back,
but
the
fifth
circuit
itself
sat
on
that
case
for
virtually
four
years.
summer
of
'71
you
have
the
trial.
december
2
of
'71
you
have
oral
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit.
july
23,
1975,
you
finally
have
an
opinion
from
the
fifth
circuit
with
respect
to
the
july
of
'71
remedy.
therefore
we
start
again
on
hearings
february
2,
1976,
on
how
to
formulate
a
remedy.
again,
no
question
of
liability.
the
school
district
has
put
that
aside.
the
school
district
simply
wants
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
can
finally
come
to
agree
upon
as
a
remedy
for
a
large
urban
school
district
with
an
ever-decreasing
anglo
population
and
with
an
ever-increasing
minority
population,
and
being
in
the
southwest
with
a
remarkable
ever-growing
mexican-american
population.
at
this
time,
as
of
this
october,
if
the
district
court
were
to
now
be
formulating
a
plan,
it
would
be
looking
at
october's
figures
where
it
has
now
dropped
to
anglo
of
32.2
percent,
mexican-american
of
17.26
percent,
and
black
of
49.4
percent.
over
the
ten
years
that
this
second
desegregation
case
has
been
pending
involving
the
dallas
independent
school
district,
there
has
been
a
drop
of
minus
58
percent
of
the
anglo
population,
as
of
the
day
i
stand
here,
in
this
school
district.
there
has
been
an
increase
of
17.3
percent
in
the
black
scholastic
population,
and
these
figures
are
scholastic,
not
total
people
population
--
mr.
warren
whitham
and
the
percentages,
and
there,
as
to
the
mexican-american
scholastic
population,
has
been
an
amazing
increase
in
this
10-year
period
of
56.7
percent
of
mexican-american
children.
now,
how
did
we
come
to
this
circumstance?
we
are
in
the
strange
circumstance
that
mexican-americans
were
never
separated
by
state
law
in
texas.
they
were
treated
as
white.
from
this
point
on,
if
i
refer
to
anglo,
black
and
mexican-american,
i
am
speaking
in
terms
of
desegregation
as
we
speak
of
it
in
the
american
southwest,
to
have
descriptive
terminology.
on
july
16,
1971,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
liability
against
the
school
district
that
there
were
vestiges
of
a
state
imposed
school
system
as
to
blacks.
as
i
say,
from
that
point
on
we
ceased
to
fight
about
it.
we
accepted
it.
let's
come
to
the
remedy.
the
district
court,
though,
did
a
strange
thing.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
no
de
jure
showing
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
in
their
burden
of
proof
to
show
de
jure
segregation
of
the
mexican-american
student;
however,
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
mexican-american
be
treated
as
a
separate
ethnic
group
for
purposes
of
a
desegregation
remedy,
and
in
its
july
23,
1975
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
therefore,
and
this
court
--
mr.
warren
whitham
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
texas
where
the
mexican-american
case
comes
before
the
courts,
you
are
dealing
in
terms
of
the
north
and
the
west
as
to
black
in
finding
state
action
in
local
school
board
authority,
not
in
state
statute,
not
in
state
constitution.
mr.
warren
whitham
well
--
mr.
warren
whitham
blacks.
article
7
section
7
of
the
texas
constitution.
mr.
warren
whitham
said
that
children
should
be
separated
in
school
by
race,
black
and
white.
no
reference
to
mexican-americans.
mr.
warren
whitham
were
treated
as
white,
and
had
been
for
many
years
until
the
demands
for
cultural
recognition
of
this
very
growing
mexican-american
population
has
now
caused
that
ethnic
group
to
wish
to
be
treated
as
a
minority.
mr.
warren
whitham
never
by
state
statute;
never
by
state
law.
by
state
statute
or
state
constitution.
after
struggling
so
hard
with
a
school
district
with
changing
demographic
patterns
and
to
illustrate,
you
will
find
at
page
219
of
the
joint
appendix
what
the
racial
makeup
--
those
are
not
the
maps
before
you.
the
maps
before
you
would
show
where
the
children
now
go
to
school
under
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
warren
whitham
the
maps
that
were
handed
out
are
not
duplicated
in
the
appendix.
they
show
where
children
now
would
go
to
school.
duplicated
in
the
appendix
are
three
demographic
maps.
here
is
the
school
district.
the
yellow
area
basically
in
1960
was
anglo,
the
orange
area
was
the
predominantly
black
settlements
in
the
school
district.
in
your
appendix
at
page
220
you
will
find
this
map
reproduced
that
shows
what
is
referred
to
in
the
argument
and
before
this
court
as
the
anglo
area,
which
will
be
the
yellow
area.
the
orange
area
will
be
the
predominantly
black
or
predominantly
mexican-american
area,
and
when
you
study
the
briefs
and
hear
the
arguments
about
the
naturally
integrated
areas,
they
will
be
represented
here
in
what
i
will
call
the
purple
color.
those
are
problems
faced
by
the
district
court.
you
will
find
in
your
appendix
another
map
that
shows
that
color
at
page
221
of
where
the
anglos
live
across
the
north
and
east,
the
ever-growing
black
population,
and
these
slashed
lines
show
the
tremendous,
tremendous
mexican-american
growth.
i
will
simply
yield
any
rebuttal
time
i
have
to
finish
these
remarks.
the
twenty
minutes
allotted
for
a
case
this
complex
for
the
school
district
is
simply,
i
must
say,
inadequate
to
get
the
story
over.
the
district
court
became
dissatisfied
with
the
school
district's
plan
and
with
the
naacp
plan
and
called
a
special
meeting
on
september
16
of
'76
for
the
community
to
come
together,
all
parties
in
the
lawsuit.
the
district
court
then
asked
a
tri-ethnic
civic
group
to
come
up
with
a
plan.
that
tri-ethnic
civic
group
did
come
up
with
some
concepts.
the
district
court
then
ordered
that
tri-ethnic
group
to
come
in
as
amicus
curie
and
present
some
evidence.
the
district
court
then
ordered
the
school
district
to
take
that
tri-ethnic
group
of
citizens'
concepts
and
flesh
them
up
into
a
student
assignment
plan.
what
you
have
before
you
is
the
result
of
a
tri-ethnic
group
seeking
to
formulate
a
remedy
for
the
dallas
independent
school
district.
i
will
move
on.
the
court
of
appeals
became
very
concerned
over
time
and
distance
studies.
time
and
distance
studies
were
not
necessary
here.
time
and
distance
studies
were
used
simply
as
an
excuse
to
get
around
swann's
great
dilemma,
and
i
must
hurry
and
say
what
it
is.
when
you
say
there
is
to
be
no
requirement
of
racial
balance,
but
you
say
on
the
other
hand,
you
must
eliminate
one-race
schools,
you
leave
the
lower
courts
and
school
boards
with
a
tremendous
difficulty
of
how
do
you
accommodate
to
that
dilemma?
that
dilemma
must
be
resolved
in
the
urban
condition,
but
when
the
court
of
appeals
sent
this
case
back,
it
overlooked
the
record
on
time
and
distance
as
surely
as
anything
in
the
world.
the
plaintiff's
own
witness,
professor
willie,
on
appendix
51
you
will
see
his
statement,
"i
made
time
and
distance
studies
and
it
takes
too
long
to
go
from
north
dallas
to
east
oak
cliff,"
which
is
the
predominantly
thing.
the
plaintiff's
own
lawyer,
my
friend
and
brother,
mr.
cloutman,
who
will
argue
here,
made
a
time
and
distance
study
and
let
it
go
at
that,
where
it
would
take
35
minutes
and
22
miles
to
get
from
the
predominant
white
area
to
the
predominant
black
area,
and
he
admits
he
made
that
test
on
noon
on
a
sunday,
which
is
completely
illogical.
but
the
fifth
circuit
had
that
before
it.
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
the
court's
own
expert
witness
who
said,
"you
can't
do
crosstown
bussing
that
requires
a
travel
time
greater
than
30
minutes,"
and
they
recognized
that
when
they
formulated
their
plan.
mr.
warren
whitham
if
you
conduct
those
time
and
distance
studies,
all
the
court
of
appeals
will
find
is
what
all
of
the
parties
to
this
lawsuit
knew
and
what
the
district
judge
knew,
and
the
district
judge
has
had
this
case
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
for
10
years,
and
that
is
that
the
time
and
distance
from
where
the
anglos
live
and
where
the
predominantly
minority
areas
are
is
too
far
and
is
beyond
all
of
swann's
teachings
with
respect
to
transportation.
also
i
would
point
out
that
of
the
now
32
percent
anglos
that
we
deal
with
in
this
district
to
be
a
part
of
a
remedy,
that
not
all
of
them
live
in
just
the
north
and
east,
the
so-called
yellow
strips
you
will
see
in
the
appendices
at
219.
probably
45
percent
of
these
remaining
anglos
now
make
up
the
anglos
in
the
naturally
integrated
areas
that
you
will
see.
so
for
a
school
district
and
a
district
judge
to
come
to
grips
--
mr.
warren
whitham
--
to
come
to
grips
in
the
urban
society
with
an
ever-growing.
anglo
population,
with
the
plaintiffs
in
their
own
plan
admitting
three
times
--
and
it's
in
the
record
and
in
the
briefs
--
that
distance
is
too
far
from
the
whites,
that
the
growing
black
population
is
too
far
from
the
ever-decreasing
anglo
population,
that
the
condition
and
quality
of
schools
in
the
so-called
east
oak
cliff
or
predominantly
black
areas
warrant
them
remaining
one
race,
when
you
see
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
in
effect
virtually
pays
tribute
to
the
district
judge
for
having
considered
the
many
complex
factors
involved
in
the
urban
society
and
formulated
a
comprehensive
plan
for
a
remedy,
but
simply
because
they
will
not
face
up
to
the
dilemma
of
no
racial
balance
and
eliminate
one-race
schools,
have
played
volleyball
with
desegregation
cases,
including
this
one
on
the
remedy,
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
then
in
the
urban
society
we
will
never,
never
be
able
to
bring
these
difficult
matters
to
an
end.
i
appreciate
your
courtesy.
mr.
warren
whitham
mr.
chief
justice,
i
knew
my
time
was
up,
but
i
understand
mr.
donohoe
had
yielded
--
mr.
warren
whitham
three
minutes.
let
me
reply
briefly
to
some
things
i
have
heard
here.
first,
the
plaintiff's
plans
a
and
b
and
the
naacp
plan
all
proposed
magnet
schools,
so
they
were
for
them
to
start
with.
second,
the
plaintiffs,
in
effect,
have
abandoned
their
plans
and
counsel
has
so
admitted
to
me,
mr.
cloutman,
and
never
urged
them
in
the
5th
circuit.
oddly
enough,
following
the
entry
of
the
district
court
student
assignment
plan
and
its
total
remedy,
mr.
cloutman,
my
brother,
filed
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
as
the
prevailing
party
under
the
educational
amendments
act
of
1972,
and
received
a
substantial
award
of
attorney's
fees
from
the
district
court
on
the
theory
that
he
was
the
prevailing
party,
that
is
that
the
plaintiffs
were,
and
he
represented
to
the
court
and
the
court
so
found,
and
you
will
find
this
in
our
brief
and
in
the
appendices,
that
virtually
every
precept
and
proposal
that
the
plaintiffs
had
made
to
the
district
court
had
been
incorporated
in
the
district
court's
remedy.
next,
we
should
consider
my
brother,
mr.
cunningham's,
language
about
k-3.
consider
the
following
language
admitted
to
by
mr.
cunningham
-
"the
members
of
the
naacp
can
see
justification
possibly
for
k
through
3
because
we
are
dealing
with
young
children
the
first
time
in
school.
i
have
talked
with
some
teachers
and
they
explain
that
these
kids
may
lose
or
may
have
problems,"
et
cetera,
end
of
quote.
that
admission
was
made
to
the
district
judge.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
desegregation
of
systems,
school
systems.
this
court
recognized
in
keyes
that
the
plaintiffs
had
never
had
to
prove
separation
of
the
races
by
individual
school
building
or
individual
student,
and
that
reference
is
contained
in
our
brief.
it
is
the
system
that
we
must
look
to,
the
entire
system,
and
how
to
desegregate
it
given
the
awesome
urban
problems
that
we
deal
with.
there
is
a
valid,
proper
constitutional
issue
before
this
court
and
this
court,
now
given
columbus
and
dayton
of
last
summer,
will
ultimately
have
to
live
with
it,
and
in
the
name
of
help
for
the
urban
condition,
north
and
south,
it
must
be
addressed
in
the
framework
of
what
this
district
judge
has
tried
to
do
for
an
urban
condition,
regardless
of
whether
it's
in
a
state
that
sent
its
troops
to
the
army
of
northern
virginia.
and
that
issue
is,
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
if
there
is
a
remedy
to
be
corrected
for
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
must
be
a
constitutional
question,
and
again
we
must
address
the
problem
of
what
is
the
definition
of
a
one-race
school.
nowhere
is
that
addressed.
thank
you.
