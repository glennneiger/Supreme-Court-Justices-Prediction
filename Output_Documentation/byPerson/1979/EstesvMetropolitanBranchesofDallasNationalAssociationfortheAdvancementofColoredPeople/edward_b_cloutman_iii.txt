mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
tasby
and
others,
original
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
below
in
the
trial
since
1970,
we
support
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
5th
circuit,
which
is
a
very
simple
and
i
believe
direct
order,
simply
requesting
of
the
trial
court
to
make
further
findings
regarding
a
new
student
assignment
plan
as
to
any
one-race
schools
he
deemed
to
be
necessary,
and
necessary
for
purposes
of
all
the
factors
articulated
in
swann.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
court
may
consider
any
practicality
necessary
to
make
the
plan
realistically
work
--
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
my
answer
is
not
necessarily
yes,
based
upon
the
record
in
the
dallas
case.
the
dallas
case
explored
that
very
thoroughly,
and
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
it
will
cause
that.
we're
talking
about
dallas
and
the
dallas
school
system,
so
for
dallas
i
would
say
no,
the
court
would
not
be
reasonable
in
including
such
a
factor
in
limiting
racial
segregation
of
the
schools.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
the
record
shows
many
expert
opinions
as
to
what
might
have
happened,
what
might
happen
in
the
future,
and
those
are
divergent
--
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
you're
asking
if
the
anglo
enrollment
has
decreased;
it
has.
it
began
decreasing,
mr.
justice
white,
prior
to
litigation
in
this
case,
however,
not
as
a
direct
result
of
this,
and
probably
as
a
result
of
many
things.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
there
may
be
several.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
there
may
be
several
of
those
pockets
of
neighborhood
residences,
that's
true.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
in
each
plan,
by
the
way,
proposed
by
the
planners,
we
preserved
to
the
extent
that
we
could
those
areas
intact.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
we
did
not,
in
both
plans
a
and
b.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
particular
reasons
that
we
indicate
to
the
court
it
should
support
the
5th
circuit's
decision
are
quite
simple.
the
unexplained
exclusion
of
high
school
grades
from
any
part
of
the
plan
without
any
justification
in
the
record
we
think
all
by
itself
requires
a
remand
for
hearings
and
a
new
plan
to
include
those
very
schools.
by
way
of
example,
the
maps
you
have
before
you
demonstrate
the
absolute
feasibility
of
desegregation
in
grades
4
through
8
in
a
precisely
identical
manner
that
the
high
schools
may
be
integrated
throughout
dallas,
and
you
are
using
older
students.
no
rationale
in
the
record
or
in
the
court's
findings
exists
for
their
exclusion.
for
that
reason
alone
the
5th
circuit
was
correct.
the
5th
circuit
also
points
out
indirectly,
and
there
is
no
rationale
given
in
the
court's
findings,
the
exclusion
of
k-3.
now,
while
this
court
said
in
swann
the
age
of
children
may
be
considered,
there
is
no
explanation,
no
rationale,
and
no
evidence
in
the
trial
record
regarding
the
exclusion
of
those
children.
for
that
reason
again,
and
the
fact
that
the
exclusion
of
high
schools
and
k-3
centers
from
a
student
assignment
plan
results
in
basically
close
to
100
one-race
administrative
units.
those
children
in
k-3
centers
do
not
attend
class
with
students
of
another
race
in
over
100
cases.
they
may
have
black
or
white
children
in
the
building,
but
they
are
not
in
their
classrooms,
and
they
are
for
all
purposes
segregated.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
yes.
by
way
of
example
again,
the
maps
before
you,
and
we
have
demonstrated
this
in
our
brief,
there
is
an
elementary
school
named
carr,
and
the
students
are
all
black
and
are
sent
to
a
far
north
dallas
school
to
attend
grades
4
through
6.
at
the
conclusion
of
this,
when
they
are
met
by
white
students,
they
are
transferred
further
north
and
further
east
to
the
ewell
walker
middle
school,
grades
7
and
8.
now,
these
students
are
traveling
20
miles
or
better.
now,
after
having
attended
segregated
k
through
3
and
integrated
4
through
8,
they're
sent
back
home
to
an
all-black
high
school
to
complete
their
education.
there
is
no
rationale
in
the
plan
for
that,
and
the
5th
circuit
says
why
do
you
do
this?
we
want
some
reasons
for
this
court
to
support
that
result.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
was
ours.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
plaintiff's
plans
a
and
b.
we
had
two.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
the
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
plaintiff
tasby
and
others.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
they
had
a
third
plan,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
our
evidence
was
35,000,
your
honor.
the
court
makes
inconsistent
findings,
as
you
have
noted,
as
to
how
many
students
it
will
actually
require
for
transportation.
the
plaintiff's
plan
a,
i
will
submit,
and
plaintiff's
plan
b
and
the
court's
own
expert's
plan
all
desegregated
east
oak
cliff
more
than
the
plan
presently
in
existence.
there
were
three
better
plans
testified
to
by
three
different
groups
of
persons
in
the
record,
and
their
rejection
is
not
explained,
either.
now,
the
court's
reference
to
time
and
distance,
there
are
no
time
and
distance
studies
supportive
of
any
rejection
of
plaintiff's
a,
plaintiff's
b,
dr.
hall's
plan,
or
in
support
of
the
plan
adopted
by
the
court.
the
record
is
just
absent,
except
for
the
little
time
and
distance
studies
that
we
did
perform
on
plaintiff's
a,
and
what
counsels
refer
to,
we
did
measure
the
longest
bus
run
of
22
miles
in
plaintiff's
a.
that
was
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
the
longest
was
going
to
look
like.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
the
court
is
making
a
conclusion
in
its
opinion
with
no
record
evidence
to
support
it.
that
is
what
the
5th
circuit
noted.
we
have
no
record
evidence
and
the
court
makes
no
detailed
findings
as
to
why
it
concludes
time
and
distance.
the
court
couldn't
find
the
trial
judge
clearly
erroneous
because
there
were
no
facts
for
them
to
review.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
he
had
not
measured
them
himself,
i
don't
believe,
and
there
was
certainly
no
evidence
he
did.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
no,
your
honor,
not
accurate.
you
may
measure,
i
suppose,
with
a
ruler
front
to
back,
but
it
does
not
tell
you
street
miles.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
i
think
that
only
an
expert
can
tell
us
with
any
certainly
not
only
what
distances
are,
but
what
times
are
going
to
be
like.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
that's
correct,
and
--
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
the
court
tried
in
1971,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
high
school
assignment
plan
to
which
it
in
whole
abandoned,
and
in
part
because
the
court
assigned,
for
instance,
100
white
students
to
a
thousand-person
black
school
and
students
in
that
case
did
not
show
up.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
the
fact
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
record
to
support
his
conclusions.
the
court
of
appeals
was
being,
i
submit,
very
gentle
in
their
opinion.
there
is
no
record
to
suggest
the
magnet
schools
would
have
ever
worked.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that,
and
there
is
everything
to
indicate
in
the
past
that
volunteer
transfers
have
not
worked
in
dallas,
and
that's
all
the
magnet
schools
are,
is
a
system
of
voluntary
transfers.
the
record
now
indicates
they
have
not
worked
in
all
but
one
case.
one
desegregated
high
school
has
resulted
out
of
that
plan.
one.
and
on
that
and
that
alone,
the
court
of
appeals
could
have,
i
submit,
reversed,
but
it
didn't.
it
vacated
and
requested
the
trial
judge
to
hold
further
hearings
on
new
student
assignment
plan
so
that
it
could,
the
court
of
appeals
could
review
the
rationale
and
the
reasons
supporting
the
court's
conclusion.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
absolutely.
absolutely
a
lot
of
bussing.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
or
a
lot
of
cars.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
that's
right,
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
that's
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
white,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
bus
routes,
since
many
of
the
magnets
are
district-wide,
are
as
long
as
the
ones
the
court
says
it
can't
use
that
are
too
long.
the
students
come
from
all
over
the
district.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
mr.
justice
powell,
you're
correct
and
that
is
the
--
in
the
latter
assumption
that
there
are
special
programs
being
offered
to
schools.
my
analogy
of
the
majority
to
minority
was
the
students
were
voluntarily
opting
to
go
to
schools.
that
was
not
working.
it
hasn't
worked
in
the
magnet
schools,
either,
and
apparently
the
parents'
choice,
as
you
suggested,
may
make
a
difference
appears
wholly
speculative,
because
it
didn't
make
a
difference
in
majority
to
minority
and
has
not
made
a
difference
in
the
magnet
schools,
either.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
i
believe
there
are
6
or
7
in
operation.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
we
approved
a
bond
issue
following,
approved
bond
issues
during
litigation,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
your
honor,
that
is
wholly
speculative.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
this
plan
has
the
support
of
the
community
or
not.
it
does
not
have
the
support
of
the
litigants
in
this
court.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
many
of
them,
at
least.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the,
i
think
the
issue
raised
by
several
members
of
the
court
earlier.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
issue
of
constitutional
violation
properly
before
this
court.
if
there
is,
the
record
is
so
complete
the
court
should
take
five
minutes
and
dispose
of
that
question
in
the
affirmative.
the
violation
was
rampant.
this
district
has
resisted
in
25
years'
litigation
anything
close
to
a
student
assignment
system
that
would
allow
desegregation
of
any
sort
in
dallas.
when
we
started
litigation
and
found
that
70-some-odd
schools
are
all
anglo
and
49
are
all
minority,
in
1970
after
a
stair-step
plan,
we
know
we
have
vestiges
of
the
dual
system.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
because
we
--
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
i
know
for
a
fact
that
37
schools
that
were
one
race
black
under
the
pre
stair-step
plan
continue
to
be
part
of
the
52
black
schools
today,
and
that
is
a
vestige,
clear
and
simple.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
i
know
they
were
black
before
that;
i
know
they're
black
now.
mr.
edward
b.
cloutman,
iii
very
simple,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
black
students
were
required
to
go
to
those
37
schools
by
law
and
by
school
district
practice
prior
to
1965.
no
excuses,
no
transfers,
no
exceptions,
and
no
integration.
and
in
1970
there
are
49,
including
the
original
37,
still
black
and
one
race.
now,
i
can
tell
this
court
that
in
my
judgment
that's
a
reasonable
inference,
when
the
schools
have
always
been
black
and
were
black
by
state
law
and
black
by
school
board
policy,
which
certainly
is
a
de
jure
act,
that
when
you
find
them
in
1970
still
black,
they
are
a
remnant
or
a
vestige
of
that
system,
unlawful,
and
must
be
remedied
in
this
case.
