mr.
james
a.
donohoe
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
let
me
try
to
answer
the
question
you
posed
to
mr.
whitham,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
represent
a
group
of
parents
and
citizens
who
reside
in
an
area
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
naturally
integrated,
in
terms
of
school
population.
and
the
reason
we
are
here
before
--
mr.
james
a.
donohoe
it
would
be
in
the
eastern,
near
eastern
portion
of
the
school
district,
justice
stewart.
mr.
james
a.
donohoe
yes,
that's
correct.
the
reason
that
we're
here
complaining
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
might
be
best
stated
by
just
reading
the
applicable
portion
of
the
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
says
-
"we
cannot
properly
review
any
student
assignment
plan
that
leaves
many
schools
in
a
system
one
race
without
specific
findings
by
the
district
court
as
to
the
feasibility
of
these
techniques.
there
are
no
adequate
time
and
distance
studies
in
the
record
in
this
case.
consequently
we
have
no
means
of
determining
whether
the
natural
boundaries
and
traffic
considerations
preclude
either
paring
and
clustering
of
schools
or
the
use
of
transportation
to
eliminate
the
large
number
of
one-race
schools
still
existing."
now,
mr.
whitham
stated
that
this
is
a
remedy
case
i
think
you
can
go
a
little
further
than
that.
this
case
really
only
involves
questions
of
student
assignment.
there
are
no
issues
here
regarding
site
selection,
faculty
desegregation,
school
administration,
single-member
school
districts,
or
any
of
these
kinds
of
issues.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
specific
finding
by
the
district
judge
that
the
school
board
was
in
good
faith
subsequent
to
1971,
attempting
to
meet
the
swann
requirements
following
the
brown
decision.
now,
our
concern
is
that
in
a
situation
where,
at
march
1
of
this
year,
there
were
only
about
40,000
anglo
students,
slightly
over
40,000
anglo
students
left
in
the
school
district,
of
which
38,000
under
the
plan,
if
you
turn
to
the
respondent
plaintiff's
brief,
were
already
in
statistically
or
numerically
integrated
schools,
that
there
simply
weren't
enough
school
students,
anglo
students,
left
to
transport.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
government's
brief
they
acknowledge
that
at
march
1,
only
8
percent
of
the
schools
of
the
anglo
students
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district
were
going
to
predominantly
anglo
schools.
now,
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
aren't
very
many
anglo
students
left
in
the
district.
the
few
that
are
left
are,
a
good
percentage
of
the
few
that
are
left,
are
in
naturally
integrated
neighborhoods.
in
view
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
it
was
aware
of
these
facts,
or
at
least
the
record
was
before
it,
we
are
concerned
that
the
effect
of
their
decision
to
order
time
and
distance
studies
is
to
effectively
order
transportation
of
students.
we
certainly
agree,
justice
stewart,
that
the
swann
decision
does
not
require
bussing,
but
what
we
are
concerned
with,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
concerned
with
in
the
valdosta
case,
where
this
court
rejected
certiorari,
petition
for
certiorari,
but
over
his
objection,
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
too
concerned
with
one-race
schools,
and
that
you
could
have
the
absurd
result
in
this
case
of
in
fact,
an
order
of
having
--
pardon
me.
you
could
have
the
absurd
result
of
having
transportation
of
anglo
students
or
black
students
from
naturally
desegregated
areas
where
they
consensually
elected
to
live
together,
to
other
parts
of
the
school
district
in
order
to
eliminate
one-race
schools.
thank
you.
