justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
the
district
court
made
a
reference
--
primarily
been
talking
about
these
oak
cliff
areas,
as
i
understand,
and
i
think
the
district
court
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
i
think
all
but
one
of
the
plans
contemplated
leaving
the
east
oak
cliff
area
predominantly
black,
but
one
of
the
plaintiff's
plans
was
quite
different,
and
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
were
primarily
critical
of
the
district
court
for
the
lack
of
detail
in
its
findings.
do
you
understand
that
consistently
with
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
if
the
district
court
reexamined
the
record
in
detail
and
made
more
elaborate
findings,
it
would
at
least
be
open
to
it
as
one
alternative
to
re-enter
its
original
decree
supported
by
more
detailed
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cunningham,
back
in
1972
in
the
case
to
which
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
referred,
lee
against
macon
county
--
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
read
it,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
say
that
even
if
this
desegregation
order
would
result
in
complete
resegregation
--
i
think
there
were
six
schools
there
black,
or
some
number
of
schools
that
were
black
and
a
much
fewer
number
of
schools
that
were
white,
but
those
were
all
the
schools
there
were,
and
the
desegregation
order
was
supposed
to
result
in
integrating
those
schools,
and
the
court
said
even
if
complete
resegregation
would
result,
we
nevertheless
must
order
this
plan
into
effect,
order
the
hew
plan
into
effect.
do
you
support
that
holding?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
it
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
next
question
is
going
to
be,
to
you,
of
course,
that
your
colleague
suggests
that
much
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
decision
in
this
case
rests
on
an
understanding
of
the
law
such
as
that,
namely
that
except
for
their
feeling
that
the
resegregated
consequences
of
an
integration
plan
is
irrelevant.
they
wouldn't
have
come
to
the
conclusions
they
did.
now,
is
that
--
to
what
extent
is
the
approach
to
desegregation
cases
such
as
lee,
to
what
extent
does
the
present
decision
rest
on
such
an
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
district
court
on
a
remand
such
has
been
suggested
in
this
case
is
--
is
he
forbidden
or
is
he
permitted
to
take
into
account,
in
formulating
his
plan,
whether
or
not
a
particular
plan
that
has
been
suggested
will
result
in
further
resegregation
ultimately,
or
white
flight
or
black
flight?
is
he
forbidden
to
take
that
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
naacp
was
just
as
certain
as
it
could
be
from
experience
that
bussing,
this
cross-bussing
would
result
in
these
black
children
next
year
or
the
year
afterwards
nevertheless
going
to
an
all-black
school
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
whites
or
any
people
of
any
other
color
to
go
to
school
with,
even
if
the
naacp
was
convinced
by
experience
that
that
would
occur,
would
you
still
be
arguing
what
you
are
now,
that
you
must
take
that
first
step?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
he
take
into
account
the
possibilities
of
whites
moving
out
of
the
public
school
system,
or
may
he
not,
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
your
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
doesn't
show
why
the
percentage
of
whites
in
the
dallas
school
system
is
so
much
lower
than
it
was,
or
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
about
the
opinions.
isn't
it
the
fact
that
there
is
a
much
lesser
percentage
of
whites
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
i
take
it
there
is
still
a
naturally
integrated
area
in
town
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
hasn't
been
particularly
upset
by
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
schools
in
those
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
don't
have
to
use
either
those
blacks
or
those
whites
to
integrate
some
other
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
magnet
high
school
had
worked
in
the
sense
that
everybody
showed
up.
would
there
have
been
a
lot
of
bussing
involved
in
getting
back
and
forth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
was
it,
a
voluntary
magnet
high
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
wouldn't
the,
if
the
voluntary
magnet
high
school
would
have
involved
a
lot
of
bussing,
it
wouldn't
have
involved
any
more
bussing
if
there
had
been
assignments
to
the
magnet
high
school?
