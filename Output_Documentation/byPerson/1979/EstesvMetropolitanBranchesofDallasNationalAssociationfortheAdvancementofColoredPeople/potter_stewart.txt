justice
potter
stewart
had
the
state
constitution
prior
to
1954
required
the
segregation
of
mexican-americans?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
state
constitution
and/or
statute,
there
had
been
a
requirement
of
segregation
of
negro
students;
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
until
1954.
justice
potter
stewart
said
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
mexican-americans
are
white?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
never
de
jure
school
segregation
of
that
ethnic
group;
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
blumenthal,
may
i
interrupt?
justice
potter
stewart
i
read
these
briefs
some
little
time
ago
and
i
remember
that
the
estes
parties
and
the
curry
parties
and
the
brinegar
parties
take
differing
positions.
justice
potter
stewart
we've
heard
from
mr.
whitham
representing
the
estes
party
who
ask
us
that
they
are
supporting
the
district
court
decree.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
your
basic
position?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
think,
in
judge
mcmillan's
case,
i
don't
think
our
court
--
perhaps
i'm
mistaken,
but
i
don't
think
our
court
has
ever
said
that
the
constitution
mandates
bussing
of
students,
but
simply
that
it's
a
permissible
tool
in
a
desegregation
decree,
once
the
court
has
found
unconstitutional
segregation.
i
think
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
remedies
permitted
in
swann.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
prescribed
remedies
in
swann,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
district
court's
decree
mandated
so-called
bussing
of
some
what,
17,000?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
district
court
did
not
eliminate
one-race
schools,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
wrong
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
is
it
you
quarrel
about
with
the
district
court's
decree?
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
or
may
not
be
post
hoc
reasoning.
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc,
you've
heard
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
had
ended
on
that
day?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
trying
to
get
at
your
position,
mr.
blumenthal,
and
perhaps
i
should
be
more
familiar
with
it,
i
would
be
if
i
had
read
your
brief
more
recently,
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
ordering
any
busing
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
go
ahead
and
finish
your
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
is
permissible
but
not
mandatory;
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
question
before
us
is
not
a
constitutional
question
at
all,
is
it?
it's
a
question
of
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
there
to
debate
about?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
admission
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
until
1954.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
just
a
matter
of
permissible
decree,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
suppose,
mr.
wallace,
that
very
similar
statistics
could
be
--
wouldn't
be
true
of
detroit
or
pittsburgh
or
cincinnati
or
new
york
city,
or
many,
many
cities
whose
states
had
never
had,
either
by
statute
or
constitutional,
de
jure
segregation?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
we
agreed
we
weren't
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
is
constitutionally
adequate.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
your
contention,
is
it,
or
is
it,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
an
integrated
school
system?
justice
potter
stewart
it
simply
requires
a
desegregated
school
system?
justice
potter
stewart
are
a
majority
of
the
one-race
schools,
at
least
of
the
all-negro
schools,
in
this
east
oak
cliff?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many?
justice
potter
stewart
28.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
total
of
all-negro
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
the
total?
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
that
mean
all-negro
schools?
not
necessarily,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
those,
28
of
the
all-negro
schools
are
in
east
oak
cliff,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
uh-huh.
justice
potter
stewart
their
right
is
to
go
to
schools
which
are
in
a
desegregated
system,
and
that's
the
extent
of
their
right,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
an
expert
presumably
wouldn't
measure
it
on
a
sunday
afternoon,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
find
the
same
situation
in
big
urban
areas
which
were
never,
never
had
a
dual
school
system.
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
know
that
any
more
than
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
find
the
same
sort
of
statistics
in
pittsburgh
or
cincinnati
or
detroit
or
chicago
or
new
york
city
which
never
had
dual
school
systems
de
jure.
then
how
do
you
know
that
the
existence
of
those
statistics
in
dallas
are
the
result
of
that
de
jure
system?
