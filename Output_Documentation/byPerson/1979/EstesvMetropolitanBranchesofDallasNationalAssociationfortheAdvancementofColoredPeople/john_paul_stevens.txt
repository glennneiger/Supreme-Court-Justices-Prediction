justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
that
bussing
is
permissible,
but
you
must
also
be
saying
that
there
are
plenty
of
circumstances
in
which
it
is
forbidden
to
be
used?
you
say
it
certainly
isn't
permissible
as
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
think
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
ought
to
be
banned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
you
must
concede,
then,
that
in
some
circumstances
it
may
be
ordered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
now,
you
just
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals?
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
says,
well,
mr.
blumenthal,
we
understand
your
rule,
but
we're
going
to
order
this
bussing
even
though
we
think
it
has
absolutely
no
chance
to
work
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
say
it
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
you
could
just
give
me
a
little
indication
of
where
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
came
the
closest
to
saying,
we're
ordering
this
bussing
or
this
review
even
though
we
have
no
hope
that
it
will
work
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
it
say
it
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
it
say
it
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
is,
then
--
what's
the
site
for
the
lee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
that
connection?
this
school
system
has
been
in
litigation
since
1955.
as
a
representative
of
the
united
states
government,
do
you
think
there
is
any
merit
in
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
well
to
bring
that
litigation
to
an
end
here
in
this
court,
to
the
extent
we
possibly
can?
can
you
imagine
yourself
trying
to
run
a
school
system
that
has
been
in
litigation
for
a
quarter
of
a
century?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
united
states
government
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
want
it
to
go
back
for
another
two
to
five
years
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
could
affirm
the
district
court,
could
we
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see
no
difference
between
this
case
and
dayton
and
columbus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
may
i
put
this
question
to
you.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
his
duty
to
adopt
a
plan
that
would
be
effective,
effective
to
accomplish
as
much
integration
as
possible,
given
the
problems
in
that
community.
is
it
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
effectiveness
of
a
desegregation
plan
in
terms
of
accomplishing
the
ultimate
objective,
and
that
is
to
have
diversity
of
students
in
public
school
systems
of
our
country,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
effectiveness
is
immaterial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
a
most
effective
plan.
that
was
a
finding
based
on
years
of
experience
with
an
intractable
problem.
what
do
you
do?
do
we
second-guess
the
district
court
at
this
level,
after
that
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
be
content
with
wholly
one-race
schools
or
two-race
schools
in
the
city
of
dallas?
