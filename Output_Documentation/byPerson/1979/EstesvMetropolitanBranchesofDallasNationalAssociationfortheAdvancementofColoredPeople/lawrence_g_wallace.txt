mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
submits
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
this
case
in
remanding
the
case
for
further
consideration
of
the
remedy
and
for
more
specific
factual
findings,
and
in
light
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
some
of
the
questions
being
argued
before
the
court
today
seem
to
us
prematurely
presented
because
they
involve
matters
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
passed
on,
and
believes
it
needs
to
have
a
fuller
record
before
it
can
pass
on
them.
the
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
remedy
adopted
by
the
district
court
was
adequate
to
disestablish
the
continuing
effect
of
a
pervasive
system
of
dual
schools
that
had
been
maintained
in
the
dallas
independent
school
district
for
generations,
pursuant
to
texas
constitution
and
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
remedial
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can
be
debated
whether
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whether
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
the
question
is
entirely
remedial.
the
question
of
liability
is
not
being
debated,
and
both
courts
below
proceeded
on
the
premise
conceded
by
the
school
board
in
this
case
that
the
dual
system
had
not
yet
been
disestablished,
we're
at
that
elementary
remedial
stage,
familiar
in
other
southern
cases,
of
disestablishing
for
the
first
time
the
continuing
effects
of
the
dual
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
familiar
in
some
of
those
as
well,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
the
conspicuous
problem
with
the
remedial
order
that
reached
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
the
large
number
of
one-race
schools
that
would
remain
under
that
order
and
the
large
percentage
of
black
students,
the
ones
found
to
have
been
discriminated
against,
who
would
still
attend
them,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals'
figures
approximately
66
of
the
176
schools
would
remain
one-race
schools.
there
are
other
ways
of
looking
at
the
figures
in
this
record,
but
they
all
come
out
showing
that
substantially
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
schools
would
remain
one
race,
and
perhaps
even
more
significantly,
59
percent
of
the
black
school
children
would
be
attending
one-race
schools,
schools
in
which
more
than
90
percent
of
the
students
would
be
minority
students.
this
is
indicated
on
page
22
of
our
brief
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
instances
it
does,
mr.
justice,
although
it's
principally
isolation
of
black
children
that's
involved.
the
best
picture
of
that
is
presented
in
the
table
on
page
53
of
the
brief
for
respondent
tasby,
the
table
compiled
from
the
april
1979
report
of
the
school
board
to
the
district
court,
and
you
will
note
that
the
percentage
of
black
students,
which
is
the
fifth
column
of
figures,
less
than
1
percent
whites
in
the
school,
38.3
percent
of
the
black
students
are
in
such
schools,
whereas
only
2.04
percent
of
the
hispanic
students
are
in
such
schools,
and
1
to
9
percent,
20.63
of
the
black
students
are
in
such
schools,
where
for
the
hispanics
it's
a
little
less
than
10
percent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
could
be
a
very
similar
pattern
of
school
assignments,
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
the
legal
question
presented
might
be
quite
different.
here
under
this
court's
decision,
reaffirmed
last
term,
there
is
a
burden
on
the
school
board
to
show
that
the
extent
to
which
there
remain
substantially
disproportionate
or
one-race
schools
in
the
system
was
not
the
result
of
the
pattern
of
illegal
conduct
that
had
been
mandated
by
law
over
a
period
of
generations,
and
that
presumptively
affected
the
development
of
the
entire
community,
the
sitting,
the
capacities
of
schools,
the
growth
of
residential
areas,
depending
on
access
to
schools,
and
the
entire
development
of
community
that
was
built
around
a
legal
system
that
mandated
racial
separation
in
the
schools.
this
is
the
familiar
law
under
all
of
the
governing
decisions
in
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
can
occur
due
to
residential
patterns
in
cities
where
there
may
have
been
some
de
jure
acts
that
added
to
segregation
in
those
cases
under
this
court's
decision
require
an
inquiry
into
the
incremental
effect
of
de
jure
acts
on
the
racial
separation
that
otherwise
would
have
existed
as
a
guide
to
the
remedy
that
should
be
used.
in
cases
of
this
sort,
that
is
not
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken.
but
rather
the
court
has
stated,
as
we
quote
on
page
42
of
our
brief
in
this
long
case
that
there
is
the
burden
on
the
school
authorities
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
racial
composition
of
those
schools
that
remain
predominantly
of
one
race
after
a
pattern
of
generations
of
mandated
racial
separation,
that
the
remainder
of
those
schools
are
not
the
result
of
present
or
past
discriminatory
action.
that
was
the
question
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
whether
there
were
findings
made
by
the
district
court
that
would
satisfy
that
the
school
district
had
satisfied
that
burden
here.
the
reason
why
this
problem
was
as
conspicuous
as
it
was
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
merely
because
of
the
more
generalized
formulations
in
this
court's
opinions
that
the
adequacy
of
a
remedy
to
disestablish
a
dual
system
of
this
kind
is
to
be
measured
by
its
effectiveness,
but
because
more
specifically
of
the
fact
that
the
last
time
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
upheld
as
constitutionally
adequate
a
desegregation
plan
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
upheld
as
adequate
for
a
constitutional
violation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
our
contention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
requires
a
desegregated
school
system.
the
question
here
is
one
of
remedy.
the
reason
the
problem
was
so
conspicuous
is
because
the
last
time
this
court
of
appeals
upheld
as
adequate
a
remedy
in
such
a
system
that
preserved
a
comparable
number
and
percentage
of
one-race
schools,
this
court
unanimously
reversed
it.
this
was
some
years
ago;
it
was
in
davis
v.
the
mobile
school
commissioners,
and
the
situation
was
very
comparable
to
the
one
involved
here,
the
figures
referred
to
in
this
court's
opinion
showed
that
64
percent
of
the
black
elementary
school
children
and
a
majority
of
the
junior
high
school
and
senior
high
school
students
would
remain
in
one-race
schools,
an
aggregate
figure
that
obviously
would
come
out
very
close
to
the
59
percent
that's
involved
here.
and
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
tools
specified
in
the
swann
case
should
be
considered
before
this
kind
of
racial
isolation
should
be
upheld,
and
when
the
district
court
looked
more
specifically
--
when
the
court
of
appeals
locked
more
specifically
here
at
the
reasons
why
the
remedy
adopted
left
so
many
children
in
one-race
schools,
they
found
that
the
problems
had
not
shown
that
the
burden
of
the
school
board
had
been
met
here.
for
one
thing,
the
whole
east
oak
cliff
area
involving
27,500
students
almost
all
of
whom
were
black,
more
than
40
percent
of
the
black
students
in
the
district,
was
simply
excluded
from
the
remedy
adopted
by
the
district
court
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
area.
that
is
the
area
that
was
excluded,
even
though
plans
had
been
submitted
to
the
district
court
that
showed
it
was
feasible
to
include
portions
of
this
area
and
the
area
was
in
a
comparable
geographic
configuration
to
the
area
east
of
the
north-south
interstate
highway
in
mobile
that
had
been
erroneously
treated
separately
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case.
indeed,
the
western
boundary
of
east
oak
cliff
is
the
north-south
interstate
highway.
there
is
a
very
close
parallel
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
nothing,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
implication
of
your
question
seems
to
me
that
the
court
may
wish
to
consider
dismissing
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
at
this
interlocutory
stage
of
the
case,
and
in
light
of
this
court's
intervening
decisions
in
dayton
and
columbus
since
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
that
is
a
course
that
should
be
considered
to
enable
the
proceedings
on
remand
to
go
forward
more
quickly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
is
very
regrettable
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
that
it
has
taken
as
long
as
it
has,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i
just
suggested
one
course
that
could
be
adopted
to
enable
the
proceedings
on
remand
to
take
place
sooner
than
they
otherwise
might.
they
would
have
been
under
way
now
had
review
not
been
granted
of
this
interlocutory
stage.
we're
all
for
proceeding
quickly
with
the
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
rather
little,
and
unless
this
court
wants
to
undertake
the
task
of
a
court
of
appeals
or
the
task
of
a
district
court
in
the
case,
there
is
relatively
little
that
it
can
do
to
conclude
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
in
light
of
its
review
of
the
governing
principles
as
recently
as
last
july.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
require
reconsideration
of
matters
that
the
court
reconsidered
and
came
up
the
other
way
on
last
july.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
many
ways
this
case
seems
to
me
to
follow
a
fortiori
from
dayton
and
columbus,
mr.
justice,
because
it's
so
much
closer
to
the
mobile
case,
as
i
have
just
been
indicating,
and
because
the
other
point
that
i
was
about
to
make,
more
than
half
of
the
grades
were
completely
left
out
of
the
desegregation
plan
by
the
district
court.
it
limited
the
plan
to
grades
4
through
8;
left
out
more
than
half
the
grades,
to
begin
with.
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
the
court
to
affirm
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
some
discretion
based
on
adequate
factual
inquiry
and
findings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
part
about
grades
9
through
12,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
swann
did
say
that,
and
i
answered
consistently
with
that
answer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
young
children
are
being
bussed,
including
some
children
in
grades
1,
2,
and
3
in
the
dallas
system
today.
there
are
5,000
children
being
bussed,
not
for
purposes
of
desegregation,
but
the
district
court
refused
to
consider
any
bussing
for
purposes
of
desegregation
of
children
of
those
grade
levels.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
cannot
accept
the
premise,
mr.
justice,
that
this
was
an
intractable
problem
as
the
record
presented
it
before
the
district
court
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
a
number
of
plans
before
the
district
court
that
showed
that
a
much
higher
degree
of
desegregation
could
be
achieved
and
no
specific
findings
were
made
about
why
those
plans
were
impracticable
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
governing
considerations.
so
i
don't
believe
it
accurate
to
assume
that
there
was
an
intractable
problem
here
that
necessitated
limiting
the
remedy
to
grades
4
through
8
and
excluding
more
than
40
percent
of
the
black
children
from
any
consideration
of
remedy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
to
preclude
this.
we
might
argue
that
it
would
be
legal
error,
but
that
would
depend
on
the
findings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
seems
to
me
the
nature
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
is
an
extremely
limited
one
here.
they
basically
said
they
didn't
have
a
full
enough
record
or
full
enough
record
or
full
enough
findings
to
be
able
to
decide
anything.
