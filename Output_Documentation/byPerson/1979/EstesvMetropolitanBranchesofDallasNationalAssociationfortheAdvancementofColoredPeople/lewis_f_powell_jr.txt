justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
put
it
a
little
bit
differently?
do
you
think
that
the
position
you
are
taking
would
accelerate
a
return
to
separate
but
equal
schools,
or
what
we
had
all
tried
to
get
away
from?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
don't
you
think
that
the
record
suggests
that
it
might
or
probably
will?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question.
the
district
court's
opinion
said
this,
and
i
want
to
understand
what
your
view
is
about
it.
it
says,
"due
to
the
geographic
layout
of
the
district
and
the
factors
of
time
and
distance,"
which
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
the
district
court
had
not
considered
at
all,
"this
east
oak
cliff
area
was
left
predominantly
black
in
every
plan
proposed
to
the
court
with
the
exception
of
plaintiff's
plan
a."
i
think
that's
the
naacp
plan,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
yours?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
two.
who
sponsored
plan
a?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
naacp
endorse
that
plan?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
anyway,
that
plan
which
proposed
to
establish
an
exact
racial
balance
in
every
school
and
which
would
have
necessitated
the
transportation
of
either
49
or
69,000
pupils,
how
many
would
the
plan
you
proposed
require
to
be
bussed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
court
talking
about
when
it
said,
"the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
given
the
practicalities
of
time
and
distance
and
the
fact
that
the
disd
is
minority
anglo,
this
subdistrict"
--
i
suppose
that's
east
oak
cliff?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
"must
necessarily
remain
predominantly
minority"
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
this
judge
live
in
dallas?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
was
unfamiliar
with
the
distances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
these
maps
show
the
distances,
don't
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course,
but
do
you
really
think
that
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you'd
have
to
lay
out
specific
bus
routes
from
school
to
school.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it
did
make
a
difference
in
the
case
of
the
magnet
schools
that
the
parents
were
making
a
voluntary
choice
for
their
children,
rather
than
a
federal
district
judge?
and
also
you
said,
as
i
understood
you,
that
the
magnet
schools
were
identical
to
the
situation
of
majority
to
minority
transfers.
am
i
incorrect
in
thinking
that
the
magnet
schools
provide
special
types
of
education,
vocational,
for
example,
so
that
children
who
elect
to
go
there
might
receive
the
types
of
education
in
subjects
which
may
be
of
special
interest
to
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
many
magnet
schools
do
you
have
in
operation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
additional
ones
are
either
under
construction
or
planned,
aren't
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
a
fact
that
the
community
down
there
approved
an
$80
million
school
bond
issue
following
this
court
decree?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
district
court
plan
have
the
support
of
the
community?
some
of
the
briefs
so
said.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
obviously.
