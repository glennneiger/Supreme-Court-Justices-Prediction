mr.
bennet
kleinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
direct
my
argument
in
light
of
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
to
--
to
rule
402
if
i
may.
it
appears
that
rule
402
sets
forth
certain
rules
regarding
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
however,
what
the
solicitor
general
has
not
taken
into
account
is
that
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court
has
historically
been
exercised
to
make
certain
that
all
of
the
prosecutorial
and
all
of
the
procedural
steps
which
involved
in
the
conviction
of
a
criminal
were
followed
by
the
executive
and
the
other
branches
which
were
involved
in
bringing
that
criminal
to
justice.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
question
that
authority
of
the
--
of
the
congress
to
do
that.
however,
i
would
suggest
that
it
may
very
well
be
and
i'm
not
taking
this
position
here
today
as
strongly
as
i
might
but
the
supervisory
power
of
these
courts
to
make
certain
that
the
constitutional
requirements
or
at
least
their
due
process
as
the
civilized
countries
of
this
world
understand
due
process
without
the
use
of
torture
and
without
the
use
of
requiring
one
to
testify
against
himself,
are
within
the
power
of
this
court,
otherwise,
there
is
no
check
upon
what
the
executive
can
do
in
order
to
bring
a
criminal
to
justice.
for
example
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
evidence
can
be
excluded.
it
is
true
that
the
constitution
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
required
to
be
a
--
a
witness
against
himself.
however,
the
courts,
through
the
supervisory
power
said,
“how
are
we
going
to
enforce
this
provision?
we're
going
to
say
that
the
evidence
is
not
admissible.”
that's
what
the
court
said
in
mcnabb.
now,
the
interesting
part
of
--
of
mcnabb
case
was,
they
were
three
brothers
who
were
brought
to
the
police
station
and
who
were
questioned
and
the
court
held
that
those
confessions
were
not
voluntary
because
of
the
time
that
was
spent
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
carried
out
and
it
did
not
permit
any
of
those
confessions
to
be
used
against
anyone.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
in
--
in
mallory,
the
--
the
evidence
was
admissible
against
others.
however,
in
mcnabb,
it
was
not.
in
the
valencia
case
which
was
decided
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
for
which
incidentally,
then
judge
mccree
wrote
the
opinion.
the
rights
of
an
individual
who
had
hired
an
attorney
were
violated
by
the
secretary
to
that
attorney
who
was
a
spy,
i
should
say,
a
spy,
an
informer
for
the
internal
revenue
or
for
the
government.
and
that
secretary
took
material
from
the
attorney's
files
and
gave
it
to
the
government
and
that
material
was
used
to
convict
three
people,
only
one
of
whom
was
the
client
of
that
attorney.
the
other
two
had
no
relationship
with
this
attorney
at
all.
yet,
judge
mccree
in
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
said
that
that
evidence
was
tainted
and
it
could
not
be
used
against
anyone.
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
was
tainted.
the
government
continues
to
act
as
if
the
--
the
activity
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
this
case
was
an
illegal
matter,
an
illegal
search,
the
constable's
blunder
if
you
will.
however
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
there
would
be
no
difference,
your
honor
if
they
killed,
i
they
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
according
to
their
argument,
if
they
killed
mr.
wolstencroft.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
will
recall,
the
briefs
point
out
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
correct.
could
the
evidence
be
excluded
if
that
had
happened?
as
a
matter
of
a
fact
in
this
case,
the
revenue
agent
in
charge,
mr.
jaffe,
was
asked,
“did
you
know
about
--
about
how
mr.
casper
was
going
to
get
this
evidence?”
he
denied
knowing
it,
although
the
court
found
that
he
did
know.
but
he
said,
“no,
i
didn't
know
but
i
didn't
expect
that
he
would
commit
murder
to
get
it.”
now,
if
it
--
if
the
government
is
correct
in
its
position
on
section
--
under
rule
402,
if
the
government
agent,
if
mr.
casper
had
killed
wolstencroft
in
order
to
get
that
evidence,
there
was
no
way
--
there
would
be
no
way
that
this
court
could
exclude
that
evidence
if
the
government's
position
on
rule
402
is
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i'm
not
sure
of
that
because
i
do
not
believe
as
i
read
some
of
the
cases
that
a
federal
agent
in
connection
with
his
duties
for
the
federal
government
may
not
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
under
state
law.
i
don't
make
that
as
a
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
he
was
a
federal
agent.
the
court
here
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes,
but
this
court
found
that
he
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes,
he
was.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
but
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government,
the
court
so
found.
he
was
an
agent
of
the
united
states
government.
i
would
like
to
--
to
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
rule
402
is
cited
--
page
15
of
the
--
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
might
say
that
the
government
has
talked
about
ratifying
an
act
in
the
--
in
their
brief,
they
talk
about
distasteful
practices.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
united
states
government
was
a
participation
--
it
was
a
participant
as
a
matter
of
fact,
planned
to
commit
a
criminal
act
in
order
to
get
evidence
against
this
defendant.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
act
of
the
government
was
more
heinous
than
the
act
allegedly
committed
by
this
defendant,
by
the
respondent
here.
the
fact
of
an
--
of
an
account
in
a
bank
in
the
bahamas
was
not
an
illegal
act.
he
had
every
right
to
have
such
a
bank
account.
the
contention
was
that
he
lied
about
it.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that
he
said
that
there
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
didn't
say
it
was
not
reprehensible,
your
honor,
but
i
suggest
that
the
commission
of
a
felony
by
stealing
this
man's
property
was
a
more
heinous
crime
than
report
--
than
failing
to
state
on
a
tax
return
that
a
man
had
an
account
in
the
bahamas
because
that
would
not
necessarily
indicate
that
any
crime
was
committed
by
him
other
than
that
statement
made.
now,
i
suggest
that
in
jacobs
case,
the
second
circuit
for
example
held,
it
was
their
opinion,
the
only
case
that
i
find
that
directly
confronted
a
section
--
a
rule
402
problem.
they
held
that
the
congress
did
not
direct
its
attention
to
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court
at
all.
and
that
therefore,
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
rule
402,
one
will
find
no
reference
to
such
an
important
matter
as
a
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
correct.
i'm
speaking
of
the
--
the
right
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
govern
the
manner
in
which
a
criminal
is
brought
to
justice,
including
its
right
to
supervise
the
activities
of
the
executive
branch
in
bringing
that
criminal
to
justice.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
believe
it
would.
yes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
it
was
an
administrative
policy
of
the
attorney's
--
u.s.
attorney's
office
to
do
certain
things.
and
this
--
the
court
in
jacobs
held
that
they
did
--
they
improperly
failed
to
do
it
in
the
case
of
jacobs
in
that
particular
situation,
but
incidentally,
through
its
decision,
it
stated
that
section
--
the
rule
402
did
not
deal
with
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court.
as
i
say,
the
--
the
receipt
or
the
acquisition
of
evidence
in
the
case
by
a
crime
as
heinous
as
the
murder
of
wolstencroft,
would
not
have
been
excludable
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
rule
402
is
correct.
i
submit
in
a
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
the
question
--
the
standing
cases
is
another
matter,
your
honor
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
that
depends
on
whether
we
rely
on
the
fourth
amendment
or
whether
we
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
standing
point?
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
the
--
the
matter
of
standing
to
be
involved
in
the
question
involving
the
fifth
amendment.
the
due
process
clause
provides
that
--
that
if
there
is
a
taint
to
evidence,
it
cannot
be
used.
the
citizens
of
this
country
are
entitled
to
know
that
the
government
--
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
will
deal
with
its
citizens
in
a
manner
which
comports
with
modern
day
civilization
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
that's
a
standing
case,
but
that
have
to
do
with
the
particular
act
that
was
--
that
was
involved.
for
example,
in
the
search
cases
--
in
the
illegal
search
cases,
we
are
dealing
with
an
act,
with
the
illegal
act
of
switching,
making
an
improper
and
an
illegal
search
against
an
individual.
and
this
court
has
held
that
an
individual
in
order
to
have
standing
to
complain
must
be
the
individual
against
whom
that
search
was
directed.
now,
there
is
--
however
i
--
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
--
the
respondent
had
the
right,
the
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
and
the
records
that
were
maintained
in
the
bahamian
bank.
so
to
that
extent,
he
could
be
held
to
have
had
standing.
however,
in
connection
with
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
i'm
--
if
there
were
such
a
treaty,
then
i
would
assume
he
did
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
because
he
would
know
that
the
court
--
that
this
government
recognizes
the
fact
that
they
could
get
those
records
and
that
if
he
knew
that,
he
had
no
legitimate
expectation.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
it
was
rejected
by
the
--
the
district
court.
it
was
not
treated
by
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
who
held
he
did
not
have
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
--
standing.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
cite
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
true.
i
agree.
however,
the
--
the
district
court
did
hold
that
the
activities
of
the
government
in
this
particular
case,
the
planning
and
direction
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
larceny,
if
you
will,
was
such
as
not
to
comport
with
the
manner
which
due
process
is
carried
on
in
this
country.
it
so
shocked
the
conscience
of
the
court.
this
was
not
a
mere
act
of
an
illegal
act
of
making
a
search
where
an
officer
of
the
government
thought
he
had
the
right
to
do
so.
this
was
a
devious
plan
to
acquire
evidence
by
means
of
a
larceny.
mr.
jaffe,
when
he
spoke
with
mr.
casper,
said,
“i
have
to
talk
to
my
supervisor.
i
have
to
talk
to
troy
register,”
who
was
the
head
of
the
intelligent
section.
he
planned
it.
if
the
exclusionary
rule
can
never
be
applied,
and
i
know
the
courts
have
struggled
with
this
problem
as
to
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
really
deters
illegal
conduct
in
--
in
the
criminal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government
as
in
this
case,
this
case
ought
to
prove
that
the
exclusionary
rule
works.
if
jaffe,
when
he
talked
with
mr.
register
in
washington,
had
come
to
the
conclusion,
both
he
and
mr.
register,
that
this
evidence
would
not
be
admitted
in
court.
if
they
did
what
they
did,
they
would
not
have
performed
that
act.
there
was
no
question
that
when
they
were
told,
“well,
go
ahead
and
do
it,”
because
the
court
has
said
that
this
man
payner
or
indeed
--
they
didn't
know
about
payner
but
anyone
whose
--
whose
name
was
there
or
evidence
against
whom
they
might
acquire
had
no
standing
to
complain,
they
went
ahead
and
did
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court's
decision
in
this
payner
case
impelled
the
internal
revenue
service
to
adopt
the
rule
with
regard
to
the
manner
in
which
evidence
is
acquired,
so
it
wouldn't
happen
again.
furthermore,
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
has
dropped
all
prosecutions
against
others
on
--
in
this
type
of
action
except
perhaps
two
or
three,
although
there
were
some
400
people
involved.
as
the
evidence
show
there
were
some
400
names
in
that
brief
case,
the
government
after
the
matter
had
been
determined
and
had
been
heard
by
the
house
of
representatives,
decided
that
they
would
not
proceed
against
any
of
the
other
persons
who
were
named
in
their
because
of
the
taint
upon
the
evidence.
this
court
will
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
--
the
hearings
before
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
think
you
can
notice
that,
yes.
there
were
hearings
before
the
house
of
representatives
in
which
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
was
involved
and
he
called
off,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trade
winds
operation
and
was
subjected
to
some
criticism
by
some
people
for
having
done
it,
but
he
called
off
the
investigation
of
trade
winds
because
of
the
manner
in
which
these
things
had
been
accomplished.
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes,
i
said
there
were
two
or
three.
i
think
there
are
perhaps
only
two.
payner
is
one
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
vasquez
is
another.
because
that
--
apparently,
that
had
gone
far
enough
at
that
time
that
they
didn't
feel
they
could
withdraw.
at
least
that's
the
evidence
we
have
from
minutes
of
the
--
of
the
intelligence
section,
that
they
--
but
they
have
withdrawn
any
activity
in
connection
with
any
other
of
these.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
except
that
you
cannot
say
that
that
in
this
particular
case,
if
it's
held
that
that
evidence
is
admissible,
the
government
can
very
well
say
okay,
now
we're
going
ahead
with
it.
the
--
this
court
must
hold
that
this
evidence
is
excludable.
otherwise,
the
government
will
proceed
and
will
not
be
deterred
from
using
evidence
illegally
obtained
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
not
true.
they
respondent
to
the
act,
to
the
--
to
the
judgment
rendered
in
this
case.
the
internal
revenue
service
did
not
adopt
its
rule
until
after
judge
manis
in
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
evidence
was
not
admissible.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
they
were
dropped
--
no,
the
--
this
--
this
case
in
itself,
your
honor.
it
was
carried
on
after
the
hearings
in
the
--
in
the
congress.
it
was
only
after
this
case
was
decided
that
the
others
were
dropped.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
the
hearings
--
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
stopped
any
--
not
further
proceedings
but
further
activity
of
agents
in
acquiring
evidence
under
the
tax
haven.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
right.
not
--
but
they
--
they
did
not
--
that
did
not
stop
the
prosecutions
at
that
time.
those
prosecutions
were
continued
until
this
court
ruled
that
the
evidence
was
tainted,
that
the
--
that
the
agents
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
had
violated
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
by
means
of
a
larceny
which
they
had
committed.
the
court
also
cast
some
doubt
as
to
whether
there
were
--
weren't
something
involved
with
this
woman,
sybol
kennedy
which
could
have
had
other
implications.
the
government
did
not
bring
sybol
kennedy
to
court.
we
couldn't
find
sybol
kennedy.
we
didn't
know
who
she
was.
i
don't
believe
that
was
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
have
no
knowledge
of
what
they
will
do
if
this
court
does
that.
however,
i
feel
that
if
this
court
does
not
affirm
the
sixth
circuit,
certainly,
the
government
will
then
feel
that
it
can
proceed
to
do
whatever
it
feels
like
in
this
case
because
the
evidence
could
not
be
excluded
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
my
understanding
of
the
question
of
standing
is
that
the
person
who
objects
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
obtained
in
an
illegal
search
must
have
standing
to
object
to
that.
and
it
has
been
held
that
that
the
person
who
can
so
complain
is
one
whose
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
has
been
violated.
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
rakas
case
in
which
it
was
so
held
that
a
person
must
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
and
that
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
doesn't
necessarily
involve
a
property
right.
he
must
not
necessarily
own
the
property,
it
might
not
be
his
property
necessarily
that
was
searched.
the
question
is
whether
he
had
the
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
i
suggest
here
and
that's
the
reason
why
i
suggested
perhaps
even
the
standing
requirement
has
been
that,
is
that
mr.
payner
had
the
right
to
believe
that
the
confidentiality
would
be
--
of
his
records
would
be
observed
and
he
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
(voice
overlap)
as
to
those
records.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes
it
did.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
right.
it
excluded
the
evidence
on
the
basis
that
the
government
had
violated
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
--
due
process
rights.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
right.
it
had
a
bad
faith
hostility
to
an
individual's
constitutional
right.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
if
you
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
then
i
assume
that
this
court
would
then
have
to
hold
that
my
client
did
not
have
or
the
respondent
did
not
have
standing
to
object
to
the
search
on
that
basis.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
then
we
--
we'll
proceed
to
the
next
basis
upon
which
the
court
ruled
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
--
and
that
is
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
there
was
a
--
a
violation
of
--
bad
faith
hostility
violation
insofar
as
an
individual's
constitutional
rights
were
concerned
and
that
so
tainted
the
evidence
that
it
is
not
admissible
in
the
court
of
law.
it
is
not
comport
with
the
american
sense
of
due
process
and
justice.
and
as
i
said,
there
were
cases
that
so
held.
i
believe
that
the
valencia
case
is
matter
in
that
line.
the
--
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
in
valencia
were
against
one
individual.
however,
the
court
said,
that
this
so
tainted
the
evidence,
it
was
so
abhorrent
to
them,
shocked
their
conscience
that
that
evidence
couldn't
be
used
even
against
the
other
two
who
had
no
connection
with
his
attorney
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
this
is
what
i'm
suggesting
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
held.
the
--
the
activities
of
the
government
here
were
so
egregious
as
to
call
for
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
judge
damon
keith
was
prompted
to
--
to
comment
during
the
time
of
the
argument
after
having
read
the
briefs
and
he
said
that
this
reminded
him
nothing
--
of
nothing
more
than
anatoly
sharansky
in
the
kgb
in
russia.
this
is
the
kind
of
an
impression
he
got
when
he
read
the
briefs
in
this
case.
this
is
how
egregious
he
felt
the
conduct
of
the
government
was.
they
planned
this
action.
the
government
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
suggest
that
that's
possible
except
however
that
he
was
in
--
under
indictment
for
some
only
of
his
own
activities.
he
lives
in
the
bahamas
and
he's
not,
as
far
as
i
know,
extraditable
to
the
united
states
and
therefore,
he
will
not
appear.
and
one
of
the
things
that
bothered
judge
manis
was
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
i
believe
that's
true,
however,
i
would
suggest
to
this
present
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
there
is
such
a
provision.
however,
in
all
my
years
of
practice,
i
have
never
heard
of
anyone
whose
rights
were
violated
by
a
search
of
having
recovered
from
anyone
who
was
guilty
of
having
performed
that
search
in
any
substantial
amounts
for
violation
of
the
civil
rights.
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
deterrent.
i
can't
imagine,
i
can't
imagine
the
jury
awarding
him
anything
once
the
government
found
evidence
which
might
implicate
him
in
a
crime.
i
can't
find
anything.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
nothing
in
connection
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
right.
that's
true.
now,
however,
the
second
circuit
also
in
the
archer
case
said
that
it
was
unthinkable,
that
the
government
--
that
evidence
could
be
admitted
when
the
government
instigated
robberies
and
beatings
of
one
individual
or
group
of
individuals
to
get
evidence
against
other
individuals.
and
that's
what
happened
here.
they
committed
a
crime.
they
violated
the
rights
of
mr.
wolstencroft,
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
evidence
is
so
tainted
--
it's
not
a
mere
error
of
judgment
of
a
--
of
an
official
of
the
government.
it's
a
deliberate
devious
plan
to
steal
something
from
someone
else.
and
that
makes
the
difference
between
a
due
process
violation
and
one
involving
particular
standing
of
this
individual.
i
believe
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
