justice
john
paul
stevens
general
mccree,
before
you
get
into
your
second
argument,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
your
first
argument
asks
us
to
overrule
miranda
because
the
giving
of
miranda
warnings
as
i
understand
is
not
constitutionally
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
--
they're
a
public
protected
rule
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
right
but
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
are
not
themselves
constitutionally
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
a
rule
proscribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
and
it's
not
provided
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
the
evidence
--
that
a
confession
given
without
the
appropriate
warrant
--
warning
shall
be
inadmissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
--
doesn't
michigan
against
moseley
clarify
that
and
make
it
rather
clear
that
miranda
is
not
a
constitutional
--
constitutional
mandate
of
their
requirement.
if
i'm
right
about
that,
then
your
argument
i
think
does
ask
as
to
overrule
miranda.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
and
of
course
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
fourth
amendment
protects
these
people
against
having
their
briefcases
searched
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
genreal
mccree
may
i
return
for
a
second
to
my
question
about
miranda
because
it
does
--
it
does
trouble
me.
i've
been
looking
at
michigan
against
tucker.
i
misdescribed
the
case
before,
at
417
u.s.
at
page
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
this
is
the
--
the
violation
of
miranda
before
miranda
was
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
whether
it
was
retroactive
in
effect.
in
the
--
at
page
444
of
the
opinion,
the
court
points
out
that
the
court
in
miranda
had
recognized
that
these
procedural
safeguards
were
not
themselves
rights
protected
by
the
constitution
but
were
instead
measures
to
ensure
that
the
right
against
self-incrimination
was
protected.
and
then
later
on
page
445,
our
determination
of
the
interrogation
in
this
case
involved
no
compulsion
sufficient
to
breach
the
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination,
does
not
mean
that
there
was
not
a
disregard
albeit
an
inadvertent
disregard
of
the
procedural
rules
later
established
in
miranda.
i
think
it
quite
clearly
draws
a
distinction
between
a
constitutional
violation
and
a
violation
of
a
procedural
rule
imposed
by
this
court
and
i
think
if
we
accept
your
theory,
we'd
say
that
rule
402
has
overruled
miranda
as
so
interpreted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
miranda
but
it's
on
the
book.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
solicitor
general
has
told
us
that
there's
a
pending
prosecution
arising
out
of
the
same
--
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
still
persisting
with
the
vasquez
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
if
that's
true,
then
we
don't
really
need
any
deterrent,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
requirement,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
if
one
of
the
differences
and
that
is
that
--
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
mr.
wolstencroft
but
i
presume
he
has
a
pretty
clear
remedy
against
the
agents
for
damages,
doesn't
he,
the
victim
of
the
illegal
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
normal
case,
the
bank
representative
who
was
victimized
by
this
kind
of
procedure
and
if
it
will
--
all
--
all
the
facts
came
out,
he'd
have
a
pretty
good
lawsuit,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
constable
wonder
type
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
a
deterrent
at
least
in
our
legal
system
that
is
not
present
in
--
in
the
russian
legal
system
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
insofar
as
i
know
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
the
normal
cases,
a
third
party
is
not
implicated
in
the
crime.
see,
this
third
party
is
in
--
as
i
understood
it,
wasn't
particularly
implicated
in
any
--
any
wrong
doing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
insofar
as
(voice
overlap)
or
maybe
he
did
something
else
that
we
don't
know
about.
