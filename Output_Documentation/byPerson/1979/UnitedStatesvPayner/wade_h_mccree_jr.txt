mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
district
court
possesses,
and
if
so,
whether
it
should've
exercised
supervisory
power
to
suppress
relevant
evidence
allegedly
obtained
in
an
illegal
search
that
did
not
violate
respondent's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
this
controversy
are
as
follows.
in
september
1976,
respondent
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
of
a
charge
of
knowingly
and
willfully
making
a
false
statement
in
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency
in
violation
of
18
united
states
code,
section
1001.
specifically,
he
was
charged
with
falsely
stating
in
his
1972
federal
income
tax
return
that
he
did
not
have
a
foreign
bank
account
when
in
fact
he
knew
that
during
1972,
he
had
such
an
account
in
the
castle
bank
and
trust
company
of
nassau,
bahamas.
the
critical
piece
of
evidence
in
the
government's
case
was
a
loan
guarantee
agreement
dated
april
28th,
1972,
in
which
respondent
pledged
the
money
in
his
castle
bank
and
trust
company
account
to
secure
a
loan
of
$100,000
extended
by
the
bahamian
bank
through
a
--
an
american
correspondent,
the
perrine
bank
of
florida
to
a
michigan
land
development
company
in
which
he
was
interested.
the
guarantee
agreement
was
produced
by
the
bank
of
perrine,
florida
in
response
to
government
subpoenas
issued
in
april
and
may,
1974
requesting
the
production
of
all
documents
concerning
the
bank
of
perrine's
business
affairs
with
castle
bank
and
trust
company.
other
evidence,
also
critical
to
the
conviction,
was
furnished
by
a
former
president
of
castle
bank
and
trust
company
who
testified
that
he
had
checked
respondent's
bank
account
with
castle
bank
and
trust
and
that
the
amount
entered
at
the
time
of
the
loan
exceeded
$100,000.
before
trial,
respondent
moved
to
suppress
this
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
has
--
had
been
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
search
conducted
in
miami,
florida
of
a
briefcase
belonging
to
a
herbert
michael
wolstencroft,
a
castle
bank
and
trust
company
officer,
indeed
a
trust
officer
who
is
visiting
in
the
united
states
in
january
1973.
the
person
primarily
responsible
for
the
search
of
the
briefcase
was
norman
casper,
a
private
investigator
who
was
used
as
an
informer
by
the
internal
revenue
service
and
who
was
working
with
the
encouragement
and
assistance
of
special
agent
richard
jaffe
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
casper
admits
--
wolstencroft
earlier,
when
casper
had
visited
nassau
in
an
effort
to
obtain
information
useful
to
the
internal
revenue
service
in
the
course
of
a
long
time
investigation
of
it
called
“operations
trade
winds”
which
was
an
inquiry
into
the
use
of
offshore
tax
havens
for
illegally
obtained
or
employed
funds
by
united
states
taxpayers.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
had
learned
that
a
suspected
taxpayer
in
san
francisco
had
an
account
in
the
castle
bank
and
trust
company
and
that
the
bank
of
perrine
florida
was
an
american
correspondent
of
the
bahamian
bank.
casper
reported
this
discovery
to
jaffe
who
encouraged
him
to
try
to
obtain
a
list
of
the
depositors
in
the
castle
bank
and
trust
company.
on
two
of
wolstencroft's
visits
to
miami,
casper
had
introduced
him
to
women,
one
of
whom
was
a
sybol
kennedy,
a
private
investigator
who
sometimes
worked
for
casper.
when
casper
learned
that
wolstencroft
was
coming
to
miami
in
january
1973,
he
arranged
with
sybol
kennedy
to
help
him
secure
a
list
of
depositors
in
castle
bank
and
trust.
wolstencroft
visited
kennedy
at
her
miami
apartment
and
after
which,
the
two
went
to
a
restaurant
for
dinner.
casper
then
entered
the
apartment
by
means
of
a
key
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
kennedy
and
took
wolstencroft's
locked
briefcase
to
a
locksmith
who
had
--
as
the
court
found,
had
been
recommended
by
agent
jaffe.
when
the
locksmith
made
a
key
by
means
of
which
the
briefcase
was
opened,
it
was
taken
to
a
photographer
by
irs
agent
jaffe
where
the
contents
were
photographed.
the
briefcase
was
returned
to
kennedy's
apartment
before
she
and
wolstencroft
returned
from
dinner.
the
internal
revenue
service
ratified
this
by
paying
casper
$8000
for
his
services
out
of
which
he
paid
$1000
to
kennedy.
jaffe
made
inquiries
about
the
persons
whose
names
appeared
in
the
photograph
material
and
learned
from
the
cleveland
office
that
respondent
payner's
returns
for
the
years
1968
through
1971
were
under
investigation.
the
cleveland
special
agent
was
told
of
the
listing
of
payner's
name
but
nevertheless,
the
investigation
in
cleveland
was
closed
for
want
of
evidence
and
the
returns
from
1968
to
1971
were
accepted
as
filed.
thereafter,
the
department
of
justice
initiated
a
grand
jury
investigation
in
miami
into
secret
bank
accounts.
the
subpoenas
were
issued
in
april
and
may
1974
and
the
critical
loan
agreement
was
produced.
this
opened
the
investigation
again
in
cleveland
which
led
to
respondent's
indictment
involving
his
1972
return.
respondent
waived
the
jury
trial
and
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence,
particularly
the
loan
guarantee
and
any
testimony
associated
with
it.
after
some
proceedings
not
relevant
here,
the
court
entered
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
then
set
it
aside
when
it
ordered
the
loan
guarantee
and
the
testimony
related
to
it
suppressed.
the
district
court
held
that
the
suppressed
testimony
was
tainted
by
the
illegal
search
of
wolstencroft's
briefcase.
it
held
that
respondent
lacked
standing
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
january
1973
search,
but
that
this,
the
government
agent's
conduct
demonstrated
a
“knowing
and
purposeful
bad
faith
hostility
to
a
person's
fundamental
constitutional
rights”
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
requires
suppression
of
the
challenged
evidence.
in
the
alternative
and
very
candidly
because
it
questioned
the
validity
of
its
fifth
amendment
determination,
it
held
“the
federal
court's
supervisory
power
over
federal
prosecution
should
be
invoked
to
exclude
evidence
obtained
by
government
conduct
which
is
either
purposefully
illegal
or
motivated
by
an
intentional
bad
faith
hostility
to
a
constitutional
right.”
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
conviction
in
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion
basing
its
determination
solely
on
the
exercise
of
supervisory
powers
and
expressly
not
reaching
the
constitutional
question.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
the
asserted
exercise
of
supervisory
powers
to
suppress
relevant
and
probative
evidence
of
criminal
activity
even
though
respondent's
constitutional
rights
were
not
violated
by
the
acquisition
of
the
evidence.
our
argument
urges
this
court
to
hold
first
that
congress
has
the
undoubted
power
to
declare
within
constitutional
limits
what
practices
and
procedures
will
govern
trials
in
federal
courts.
and
we
submit
that
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
prohibits
the
exercise
of
any
supervisory
power
that
district
court
might
otherwise
have
had
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
relevant
evidence
derived
from
the
search
of
wolstencroft's
briefcase.
the
rule
of
course
provides
all
relevant
evidence
is
admissible
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
by
act
of
congress,
by
these
rules
or
by
other
rules
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
now
we
submit
that
this
evidence
that
was
obtained
from
wolstencroft's
briefcase
was
not
prohibited
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
at
the
urging
of
payner
by
any
act
of
congress,
by
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
or
by
other
rules
which
--
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
which
would
mean
amendments
or
additions
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed,
the
congress
did
and
perhaps
most
relevant
to
--
to
our
purposes
here,
it
changed
the
last
sentence
from
other
rules
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
its
authority
or
words
to
that
effect
to
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
which
was
--
we
submit
intended
to
indicate
that
the
source
of
the
supreme
court's
authority
to
amend
would
be
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
--
that
is
our
submission.
this
is
an
express
declaration
by
the
congress
that
the
court
shall
not
exercise
a
supervisory
power
relative
to
the
exclusion
of
relevant
evidence.
now,
we
don't
say
that
the
courts
are
bereft
of
all
supervisory
power.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
brief
suggests
that
supervisory
power
is
merely
part
of
the
general
power
that
courts
possess
to
decide
cases
and
controversies.
and
the
court
everyday
uses
supervisory
powers
when
it
determines
the
procedure
that
will
be
followed
in
the
court.
but
the
congress
has
the
power
to
say
that
the
court
shall
not
use
supervisory
power
unless
it
is
subsumed
in
one
of
the
specified
sources
of
power
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
to
exclude
relevant
evidence.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that
statement
precisely.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
this
court
has
in
the
past
prior
to
the
adoption
of
section
402
purported
to
act
pursuant
or
to
recognize
the
use
of
supervisory
powers,
but
--
and
even
in
the
area
of
the
admission
of
relevant
evidence
and
we
don't
say
that
the
court
doesn't
still
possess
supervisory
powers
for
other
purposes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
rules,
the
so-called
wild
card
rule
on
--
on
hearsay
evidence
allows
courts
to
use
a
power
which
we
would
analogize
to
the
supervisory
power
to
admit
evidence
that
has
the
authenticity
or
the
same
or
equivalent
badges
of
authenticity
as
specified
exceptions
to
the
hearsay.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that
except
i
would
--
i
would
include
a
trial
court
as
well
in
that
and
i
think
it
does
have
power.
it
--
it
is
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
decide
cases
and
controversies.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
in
the
course.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
to
correct
error.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
unless
--
yes,
we
would
agree
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
would
say
that
the
congress
has
a
power
to
proscribe
rules
or
procedure
in
evidence
for
the
federal
courts.
this
court
in
palermo
versus
the
united
states
held
specifically
that
the
language
that
was
used
was
the
power
of
this
court
to
prescribe
rules
or
procedure
in
evidence
for
the
federal
courts,
exists
only
in
the
absence
of
a
relevant
act
of
the
congress.
we
submit
that
the
congress
can
provide
the
circumstances
under
which
relevant
testimony
may
be
excluded
from
evidence.
of
course,
it
cannot
tell
this
court
that
it
can't
do
it
in
contravention
of
the
constitution.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
and
that's
one
of
the
specified
grounds
of
course
on
which
the
court
can
exclude.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
or
a
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
the
way
we
read
rule
402
and
we
say
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
more
or
less
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
but
not
out
of
context.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
precisely.
before
402
was
adopted,
federal
rules
of
crimin
--
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
26
provided
in
its
second
sentence,
“the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
the
competency
of
witnesses
shall
be
governed
except
when
an
act
of
congress
or
these
rules
otherwise
provide
by
the
principles
of
the
common
law
as
they
may
be
interpreted
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
in
light
of
reason
and
experience.”
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
was
--
was
severely
circumscribed
and
402
specified
the
--
the
basis
by
which
relevant
evidence
could
be
excluded
thereafter.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
will
be
here
today.
i
will
be
here
today
to
say
that
even
if
there
is
supervisory
power
in
the
courts
that
it
was
not
correctly
exercised
in
this
case,
and
that's
my
next
argument.
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
indeed
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
would
be
that
the
power
exists
but
it
should
not
have
been
exercised
in
this
instance
because
it
amounts
to
an
utter
circumvention
of
all
of
the
standing
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
worked
out
in
a
--
on
a
case
by
case
basis
over
the
years.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
there
seems
to
be
no
question
of
that
and
this
course
is
the
end
of
the
road.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
miranda
warnings
are
under
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
--
not
to
be
required
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
to
protect
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
fifth
amendment
specifically
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
required
to
incriminate
himself
and
i
would
say
that
on
that
basis,
there
is
authority
for
the
miranda
rule
if
it's
to
be
a
precaution
against
self-incrimination.
it's
not
a
general
open-ended
chancellor's
foot
kind
of
--
of
determination.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
--
it's
not
expressly
provided
but
this
court
has
found
it
to
be
required.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
and
i
--
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
think
just
a
moment
more
about
my
response
to
it
and
i
come
back
to
--
to
my
earlier
answer
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
specifically
protect
the
person
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
--
it
protects
mr.
wolstencroft.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
doesn't
protect
mr.
payner.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
payner
has
no
more
right
to
invoke
the
fourth
amendment
here
than
a
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
a
perfect
stranger
to
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
was
my
response
i
thought
to
mr.
justice
stevens
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
there
is
the
express
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
this
is
an
ex
--
and
there
is
an
express
guarantee
against
self-incrimination
and
this
court
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
compulsory
self-incrimination
and
this
court
equated
the
failure
to
give
these
warnings
as
subjecting
a
person
to
that
--
that
risk.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
fortunately,
we
--
we
don't
have
to
face
that
--
that
question
here
though.
i
submit
that
the
literal
language
of
402
forbid
--
forbad
the
district
judge
here
from
using
an
amorphous,
and
undefined
supervisory
power
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
to
exclude
this
very
relevant,
very
probative
evidence.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
congress
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
rules
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
rules
relating
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
you
wouldn't
have
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
power
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
--
if
you
felt
constrained
by
the
constitution
to
do
that,
you
wouldn't
be
wrong.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
you
--
you've
afforded
a
remedy
to
a
person
whose
rights,
whose
constitutional
rights
you
found
to
have
been
violated.
i
think
that's
what
would
happen.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
those
cases.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
you've
denied
it
to
the
person
whose
rights
were
not
--
whose
rights
were
not
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
you've
held
that
--
that
a's
rights
cons
--
that
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
were
not
violated
by
a
search
of
--
of
--
by
the
invasion
of
a
right
of
privacy
of
b.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
was
it
--
indeed,
the
district
court
here
indeed
found
that
payner's
rights
had
not
been
violated
at
all.
and
so
this
is
--
that
this
--
this
is
--
is
a
clear
attempt
to
afford
a
remedy
to
exclude
relevant
and
probative
evidence
without
showing
that
the
person
who
claims
to
be
aggrieved
had
a
constitutional
right
of
his
infringed
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
or
a
right
created
by
a
statute
or
a
rule.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
don't
make
that
contention
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
that
here
today.
i
think
today,
you
could
agree
--
you
could
agree
with
our
position
here
that
at
the
very
least,
rule
402
forbids
the
lower
court.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
of
course
if
you
--
if
you
reverse,
you
mean
to
exclude
evidence
that
infringes
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
a's
right
but
at
b's
insistence?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
you'd
probably
find
a
constitutional
underpinning
for
it.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
it's
hard
to
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
divorce
the
notion
of
standing
from
the
notion
of
a
constitutional
right
having
been
violated.
someone's
constitutional
right
may
be
violated
but
whether
another
person
can
assert
it
is
another
matter.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
conceptually,
it's
difficult
to
separate
these.
yes,
we
have
said
that
up
till
now.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
--
they
did
not
use
it
against
him.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
case
really
should
not
be
in
--
would
not
have
been
in
this
court
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
looked
to
see
whether
this
evidence
that
was
critical
for
the
conviction
had
whatever
taint
might
have
been
produced
by
the
search
of
wolstencroft's
briefcase.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
--
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
chicago,
there's
a
case
called
vasquez,
united
states
of
america
versus
vasquez
that
grew
out
of
the
same
investigation
of
this
operation
trade
winds.
there,
also,
the
name
of
--
vasquez's
name
surfaced
in
the
photographing
of
the
contents
of
wolstencroft's
briefcase,
but
the
district
court
determined
that
since
they
already
knew
that
the
bank
of
perrine,
florida
was
a
correspondent
for
the
castle
bank
and
trust
company
and
had
the
information
that
led
them
to
subpoena,
the
castle
bank
and
trust
company
papers
in
the
bank
of
perrine's
possession
that
this
was
an
independent
source
of
information
and
therefore,
there
was
no
taint
connected
with
going
into
the
briefcase
and
there
was
another
episode
too
where
casper
allegedly
took
a
rolodex
or
i
think
it
was
kennedy,
took
a
rolodex
address
device
which
didn't
figure
into
this
case.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
this
and
addressed
the
question
obtained,
i
think
this
case
might
not
have
been
here.
i
think
it
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
the
district
court
in
illinois
did
and
certainly
that
case
is
pending
now
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it's
also
instructive
to
--
to
me
anyway
that
the
district
court
in
vasquez
also
found
that
--
and
--
and
said
so
expressly
that
to
allow
the
use
of
supervisory
powers
here
would
circumvent
this
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
associated
with
the
concept
of
standing.
and
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
is
that
the
use
of
the
evidence
to
impeach,
for
impeachment
purposes?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
alright.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
have
said
before
that
i
have
a
conceptual
difference
--
difficulty
with
this
problem
on
habeas
of
course,
a
state
judgment
may
be
reviewed
only
for
a
constitutional
violation.
i
see
my
time
is
fast
fleeting,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
then
i
should
follow
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
unless
the
court
adopts
a
rule
pursuant
to
statutory
authority,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
our
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
our
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
our
suggestion
is
that
the
court
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
reverse
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
remand
the
case
and
require
it
to
address
the
questions
that
it
did
not
address
in
this
very
brief
per
curiam
opinion
and
we
believe
they'll
find
no
taint.
they'll
find
that
the
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
i
would
have
to.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
