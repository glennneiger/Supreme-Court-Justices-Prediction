chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
payner.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say,
i
take
it,
mr.
solicitor
general
that
this
is
an
express
declaration
by
the
congress
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
it
in
another
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
put
it
in
another
way,
are
you
saying
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
section
402,
the
powers
of
the
court
--
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court
may
well
have
embraced
this
kind
of
supervisory
authority,
but
that
congress
has
deliberately
withdrawn
that
jurisdiction
from
the
courts
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
402
were
not
in
the
books,
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
be
here
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
will
be
a
different
basis
entirely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
the
court
read
it
as
having
congress
say
to
us
that
from
this
time
on,
you
will
not
make
any
rules
except
within
the
framework
of
402.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
leave
miranda
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
intact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
that's
the
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
reach
just
the
standing
and
if
the
court
rest
solely
on
standing,
where
would
we
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
up
to
now
we
have
said
they
couldn't
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
fled,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
one
question
though
which
relates
to
justify
what
we've
been
focusing
on.
assuming
that
the
court
had
supervisory
power
linked
to
constitutional
underpinnings
that
you
have
suggested
when
it
adopted
miranda
and
when
it
acted
in
the
tucker
case,
is
it
your
position
that
whatever
that
authority
was,
congress
has
now
withdrawn
that
jurisdiction
from
--
from
this
court
under
402?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kleinman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
question
the
authority
of
the
congress
to
withdraw
specific
areas
of
jurisdictions
from
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
believe,
mr.
kleinman,
before
you
go
too
far
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
let
me
--
i'm
just
--
to
take
you
on
that
to
testify,
to
be
compelled
to
testify
against
himself,
we
don't
need
to
get
any
more
authority
to
deal
with
that
than
we
have
under
the
constitution,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
was
true
in
mallory,
was
it
not,
in
the
mallory
case
that
followed
mcnabb?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
anderson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatever
you
rely
on,
you
have
to
get
by
that
one
point,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
involved
in
alderman?
what
was
involved
in
the
alderman
case?
that's
a
standing
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
we
had
a
--
what
if
we
had
a
treaty
that
would've
allowed
us
to
“extradite”
that
--
that
--
those
records.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
--
where
do
we
find
that
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
--
we
--
you're
suggesting
we
can
judicially
notice
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kleinman,
at
least
for
me,
you
--
you
covered
the
standing
point
so
swiftly
that
i
think
i
missed
it.
now,
mr.
justice
stevens
has
a
question
but
i'd
like
to
have
you
reach
the
standing
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
your
arguments,
even
if
the
exclusionary
rule
were
modified
as
has
been
advocated
from
time
to
time
to
say
that
it
should
not
apply
to
the
cases
where
the
constable
blundered
but
only
to
cases
of
egregious
calculated
intentional
violations
that
this
would
fall
under
the
latter
category.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it's
not.
we
are
glad
to
have
you
terminate
if
you
want
to.
i
think
your
time
was
consumed,
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
