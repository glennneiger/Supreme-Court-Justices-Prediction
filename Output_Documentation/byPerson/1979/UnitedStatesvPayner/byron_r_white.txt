justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then,
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
rules
and
that
section
in
particular
tells
the
courts
that
unless
you
find
some
constitutional
ground
for
exclusion
or
unless
you
find
some
ground
for
excluding
expressed
in
these
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
some
other
statute,
you
may
not
exclude
the
relevant
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
and
that
prior
to
the
rules,
the
rules
of
evidence
were
--
you
found
them
in
the
books,
the
courts
had
made
them
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
then
they'd
--
then
--
then
it
was
decided
to
--
to
reduce
the
rules
of
evidence
to
a
written
--
to
a
set
of
rules
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
then
the
congress
turned
it
into
a
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
--
that
power
was
eliminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
inconsistent
with
our
standing
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
at
least
absent
those
warnings
is
somebody's
--
the
state
is
in
cons
--
in
constitutional
trouble,
but
the
miranda
and
some
other
cases
indicated
that
those
--
these
particular
prophylactic
rules
might
not
be
the
only
satisfactory
protection
that
a
state
could
satisfactorily
give
to
the
fifth
amendment
right,
but
absent
some
other
protections
and
absent
these
warnings,
a
state
conviction
is
vulnerable.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
--
suppose
--
suppose
someone
asked
us
to
overrule
alderman
or
it
was
one
of
the
standing
cases
that
says
that
if
--
that
mr.
a
can't
object
to
a
fourth
amendment
violation
of
mr.
b
and
we
--
five
justices
think
those
standing
cases
were
wrong,
that
those
are
just
prudential
rules
anyway.
so
we'll
reverse
alderman
and
you
say
that
a
does
have
standing
to
object
to
b.
i
take
it
your
argument
would
say
we
would
have
no
power
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
be
then
--
exclude
the
evidence,
this
very
evidence,
this
very
evidence
that
is
involved
in
this
case
would
then
be
inadmissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
alderman
is
--
after
all
is
a
case
of
--
in
there,
the
--
the
prisoner
has
a
case
of
controversy
with
the
state
and
the
state
is
trying
to
convict
him
by
evidence
that
was
illegally
seized
and
we
have
said,
“well,
the
evidence
--
the--
it
wasn't
seized
in
violation
of
you
rights
and
so
you
can't
object
to
it.”
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
--
is
that
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
alderman
and
those
standing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
cases
have
denied,
have
denied
a
remedy
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
being
put
in
jail
by
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
still
think
--
i
still
think
under
your
first
argument
that
in
--
in
effect,
you're
saying
congress
is
--
has
now
forbidden
us
to
--
to
overrule
any
of
our
prior
evidence
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
decided
that
you
get
to
your
second
argument
and
suppose
we,
thinking
about
your
second
argument
that
this
ruling
is
inconsistent
with
alderman
and
the
other
standing
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
say
well,
it
certainly
sounds
like
--
like
it's
inconsistent
when
we
now
--
we
now
think
alderman
is
wrong
and
we
would
like
to
reverse
it.
but
then
we
say,
“well,
the
solicitor
general
told
us
in
effect
that
we
couldn't.”
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general
just
to
--
i
did
not
--
sure
i
understood
what
your
--
one
of
your
answers,
your
recent
answers.
suppose
miranda
had
not
been
decided
until
the
today,
suppose
miranda
was
before
us
today
on
--
and
that
--
and
the
question
was,
“did
we
have
the
power
under
402
to
do
it,”
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
that
that
was
constitutionally
based
and
that
402
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
prevent
us
from
doing
what
the
court
did
in
miranda?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
i
thought
--
i
didn't
think
his
position
would
be
any
different
if
--
if
the
internal
revenue
service
broke
into
the
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
seized
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
under
their
--
under
their
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
the
internal
revenue
service
agent
might
be
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble,
but
the
question
is
about
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
wholly
aside
from
rule
402,
the
government
says
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
under
our
--
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
the
standing
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
but
you
certainly
have
to
get
by
those
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
--
this
--
your
submission
that
he
really
had
standing
because
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy.
that
is
either
been
--
not
been
presented
below
or
was
rejected
by
both
the
courts
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
think
that
if
you're
right
about
that,
the
402
argument
is
beside
the
point
and
so
were
the
standing
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
be
the
points.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
rejected
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
--
and
--
and
it
excluded
the
evidence
on
another
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
agree
with
the
district
court,
what
--
what's
your
answer
to
the
standing
cases
if
--
if
we
agree
with
--
if
we
happen
to
disagree
with
you
and
agree
with
the
district
court
standing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
this
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
then
--
then
what
--
then
what
will
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
due
process.
