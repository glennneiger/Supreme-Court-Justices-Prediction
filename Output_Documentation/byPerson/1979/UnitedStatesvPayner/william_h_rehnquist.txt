justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
congress
made
some
changes
of
its
own
in
these
federal
rules
of
evidence
when
they
were
transmitted
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
be
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing,
general
mccree,
to
say
that
concededly,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
supervisory
power
but
that
this
court
has
supervisory
power
to
supervise
their
supervisory
power
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
why
the
--
this
court
reversed
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
miranda
against
arizona
if
the
constitution
didn't
require
miranda
warnings,
would
it
not?
i
mean
our
only
authority
to
reverse
the
constitution
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
a
violation
of
federal
constitution
or
federal
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
the
district
court
here
held
that
they
had
to
create
standing
in
somebody
in
order
to
enable
him
to
litigate
unconstitutional
conduct
of
the
government
even
though
the
particular
defendant
before
them
was
unable
to
under
our
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
--
mr.
kleinman,
what
you're
talking,
i
take
it,
about
the
supervisory
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
as
a
whole,
not
of
each
in
the
court
of
appeals
independently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
general
mccree
mentioned
is
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
on
this
in
--
in
your
case,
that
conflict
would
presumably,
ultimately
have
to
be
resolved
by
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
--
it
--
it
isn't
a
question
--
as
i
recall
the
jacobs
case,
it
was
the
policy
of
u.s.
attorneys
in
the
second
circuit,
something
that
the
second
circuit
didn't
purport
to
say
was
something
ought
to
be
followed
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
fourth
circuit.
it
was
some
--
simply
some
--
more
or
less
an
administrative
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
--
justice
stevens
just
pointed
out
that
the
executive
branch
responded
to
congressional
hearings
--
any
statement
from
this
court
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
that
it
would
--
the
--
all
these
prosecutions
were
dropped
after
the
--
they
were
criticized
in
the
congressional
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
hearings
in
congress
really
didn't
amount
--
amount
to
all
that
much.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
refer
the
tax
evasion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
court
reverses
the
sixth
circuit
presumably
but
the
prosecutions
will
continue.
