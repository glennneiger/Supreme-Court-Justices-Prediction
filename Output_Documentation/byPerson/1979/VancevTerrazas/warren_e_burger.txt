chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
78-1143,
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
against
terrazas.
mr.
ryan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
this
document
signed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
vulnerable
also
to
the
suggestion
that
it
was
not
a
real,
not
a
genuine
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
he
was
born
in
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he
had
dual
citizenship
at
the
time
he
made
the
renunciation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
address
that
to
what
particular
facet
of
the
issues
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
the
burden
of
proof
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
he
ever
given
an
allegiance
formally
to
mexico?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
chief
justice
warren's
adjective
"undivided"
allegiance
bear
on
this,
if
it
does
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
could
mexico
do,
for
example,
about
enforcing
any
obligations
of
citizenship,
except
when
he
was,
perhaps,
within
the
boundaries
of
mexico?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
could
we
do
if
--
the
united
states
do,
for
example,
about
military
service,
if
he
was
in
mexico?
would
he
be
in
default
if
he
were
drafted,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
occurred
when
he
was
in
mexico
and
he
just
didn't
respond,
he
would
be
in
some
form
of
awol,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ditkowsky.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
"or
less
than
that
of
a
simple
negligence
case,"
is
that
an
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
be
satisfied
with
the
addington
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
is
the
affidavit
that
you
referred
to?
tell
me
about
the
setting
of
the
one
that
you
identified
as
14a.
in
that
one,
he
said
--
and
it
is
obviously
more
in
the
nature
of
a
letter,
not
a
form
of
some
kind,
"i
feel
more
mexican
than
american.
i
want
to
stay
and
live
here.
i
plan
on
marrying
a
mexican
girl.
i've
learned
what
a
great
country
mexico
is.
i
feel
part
of
mexico.
i
have
many
relatives
here,
i
want
to
be
near
them.
even
my
taste
in
foods
is
mexican.
i
could
not
lead
a
double
life
any
more.
"now
that
last
sounds
as
though
he
is
saying,
informally,
he
doesn't
want
dual
citizenship
any
more,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
14a?
did
he
write
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
does
not
read
--
at
least
in
my
experience
--
like
something
that
someone
told
him
to
write.
it
looks
like
a
candid
expressions
of
a
person
who
is
trying
to
state
the
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
something
prevented
you
from
giving
what
it
is
you
suggest
is
missing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
ask
that
these
other
items
be
printed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
couldn't
it
be
typed
and
reproduced
in
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
reading
the
parts
that
i
just
read
to
you,
does
that
sound
like
something
dictated
by
someone
else,
or
does
it
sound
like
a
person
who
sits
down
and
writes
out
his
thoughts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
his
statement
that
not
only
did
he
like
the
people
and
had
a
lot
of
relatives,
but
that
he
even
liked
mexican
food
better
than
ours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
probing
for
intent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
things
sound
quite
sincere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
the
statement,
"i
could
not
lead
a
double
life
any
more.
there
comes
a
time
in
everyone's
life
when
he
has
to
sit
down
and
decide
what
he
wants
to
do
with
his
life.
i
did
this
and
decided
my
future
happiness
was
here
in
mexico.
for
that
reason,
i
became
a
mexican."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
finding
to
be
made
would
be
in
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
perhaps
is
what
is
the
significance
of
the
statement
of
renunciation
of
american
citizenship,
and
how
does
that
bear
on
the
first
half
of
that
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
strong
evidence,
i
suppose
you
would
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
14?
it
is
available
to
us
now,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
have
your
point
now,
mr.
ryan.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgements
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
78-1143,
vance
against
terrazas
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
