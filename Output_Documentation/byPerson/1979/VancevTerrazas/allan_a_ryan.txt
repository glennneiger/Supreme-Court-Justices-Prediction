mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellee
in
this
case,
laurence
terrazas,
was
born
in
the
united
states
in
1947.
in
1970,
he
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico,
in
which
he
explicitly
renounced
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
he
contends
that
despite
this
act
he
remains
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
contends
that
by
that
act
he
expatriated
himself,
and
is
no
longer
a
citizen
of
this
country.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
because
appellee
was
born
in
this
country
of
a
mexican
parent,
he
was
a
citizen
of
this
country
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
a
citizen
of
mexico
under
mexican
law.
in
1968,
he
left
this
country
to
attend
college
in
mexico.
in
september
of
1970,
at
age
22,
he
signed
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
this
application
is
a
one-page
document
of
three
paragraphs,
the
most
important
of
which
reads
in
pertinent
part,
as
follows.
i
quote
"i,
therefore,
hereby
expressly
renounce
united
states
citizenship,
as
well
as
any
submission,
obedience
and
loyalty
to
any
foreign
government,
especially
to
that
of
the
united
states
of
america,"
or
north
america,
depending
on
the
translation.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
this
was
in
1970,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
september
of
1970,
he
signed
this
application,
by
his
own
testimony.
continuing
the
quotation
"and,
furthermore,
i
swear
adherence,
obedience
and
submission
to
the
laws
and
authorities
of
the
mexican
republic.
"this
application
was
duly
submitted
to
the
mexican
government,
and
on
april
3,
1971,
that
government
issued
the
appellee
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality,
which
repeated
that
appellee
had
sworn
allegiance
to
mexico
and
had
renounced
allegiance
to
any
other
government.
appellee
received
the
certificate
in
mexico.
there
matters
stood
for
approximately
four
months,
until
august
of
1971.
at
that
time,
appellee
visited
the
american
consulate
in
monterey,
mexico,
and
told
the
consular
officer
there
that
he
felt
more
mexican
than
american,
that
he
intended
to
stay
in
mexico,
and
that
he
was
concerned
about
holding
two
citizenships.
the
consular
officer
told
the
appellee
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
in
holding
dual
citizenship,
but
he
warned
appellee
not
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
appellee
revealed
at
that
point
that
he
had,
in
fact,
received
such
a
certificate.
the
consular
officer
told
him
that
he
had
probably
expatriated
himself,
but
that
a
final
determination
could
be
made
only
by
the
department
of
state
in
washington.
at
the
consular
officer's
suggestion,
the
appellee
took
with
him
forms
to
fill
out,
so
that
a
determination
of
his
citizenship
could
be
made,
and
he
returned
to
the
consulate
two
months
later
with
those
papers.
because
expatriation
is
a
sensitive
matter,
these
forms
essentially
consisted
of
three
documents.
first,
an
affidavit
in
which
the
individual
describes
the
possibly
expatriating
act
second,
a
lengthy
questionnaire
designed
to
elicit
the
factual
background
and
the
individual
state
of
mind
and
third,
a
letter
in
which
the
individual
can
state
whatever
he
wishes
about
the
matter.
the
appellee
executed
an
affidavit
in
which
he
stated
that
his
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico
was,
and
i
quote
"my
free
and
voluntary
act,
and
that
no
influence,
compulsion,
force
or
duress
was
exerted
upon
me
by
any
other
person,
and
that
it
was
done
with
the
intention
of
relinquishing
my
united
states
citizenship,"
end
quote.
in
the
questionnaire,
the
appellee
gave
conflicting
answers.
he
stated
that
he
had
taken
the
oath,
"willingly
and
voluntarily."
he
also
stated,
and
i
quote
"there
comes
a
time
in
everyone's
life
when
he
has
to
sit
down
and
decide
what
he
wants
to
do
with
his
life.
i
did
this
and
decided
that
my
future
happiness
was
here
in
mexico.
for
that
reason,
i
became
a
mexican,"
end
quote.
on
the
other
hand,
the
questionnaire
asked,
"did
you
intend
by
this
oath
or
affirmation
to
abandon
your
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
or
transfer
your
allegiance
to
the
foreign
state?"
and
the
appellee
answered,
"no."
and
in
his
letter
he
said,
at
one
point,
"by
taking
this
oath,
i
did
not
consider
that
i
was
relinquishing
my
rights
as
an
american
citizen."
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
these
documents
were
signed
in
october,
i
believe,
of
1971.
this
was
after
the
visit
to
the
consulate.
these
papers
were
submitted
to
the
department
of
state,
which
determined
that
appellee
had
expatriated
himself,
under
8
u.s.
code
1481
(a)(2).
that
statute
provides
that
a
citizen
shall
lose
his
citizenship,
by
"taking
an
oath
or
making
an
affirmation
or
other
formal
declaration
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state."
accordingly
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
expatriating
act
here
is
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico,
although
we
do
contend
that
the
state
department
was
entitled
to
consider
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made.
but
the
expatriating
act
is
not
the
renouncing
of
united
states
citizenship,
because,
as
you
state,
the
statute
requires
that
that
be
done
in
front
of
a
united
states
officer,
which
in
this
case
it
was
not.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
he
was
very
fluent
in
spanish.
that
was
his
testimony.
the
state
department
issued
the
appellee
a
certificate
of
loss
of
nationality,
certifying
that
he
was
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
when
the
appellee
received
the
certificate,
he
went
to
the
consular
officer
in
mexico
and
asked
what
he
could
do
to
get
his
american
citizenship
back.
the
consular
officer
advised
an
administrative
appeal
within
the
department
of
state,
and
appellee
took
such
an
appeal.
the
board
of
appellate
review,
following
a
hearing,
issued
an
opinion
affirming
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
of
loss
of
nationality,
and
the
appellee
then
brought
this
action
for
a
declaration
of
his
citizenship.
at
this
point,
let
me
refer
to
the
statute
that
congress
enacted
to
prescribe
rules
of
evidence
for
proceedings
such
as
the
one
appellee
commenced.
it
is
8
united
states
code
1481(c).
it
provides
two
things,
both
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
unconstitutional.
first,
it
states
that
in
any
action
where
loss
of
united
states
nationality
is
at
issue,
the
party
claiming
that
such
loss
has
occurred
--
in
this
case,
that
is
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
such
loss
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
second
provision
proceeds
on
a
premise
that
is
not
in
the
statute
itself,
but
that
the
government
has
always
recognized,
namely
that
no
act
can
be
expatriating
unless
it
is
done
voluntarily.
thus,
the
second
provision
of
the
statute
states
that
any
person
who
performs
an
expatriating
act
--
in
this
case,
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico
--
shall
be
presumed
to
have
done
so
voluntarily,
but
the
presumption
may
be
rebutted
on
a
showing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
act
was
not
performed
voluntarily.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
held
a
four-day
trial,
de
novo,
on
the
question
whether
appellee
had
lost
his
citizenship.
faithful
to
the
statute's
standard,
the
court
held
that
the
united
states
had
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
appellee
had
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico,
and
that
appellee
had
not
rebutted
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
the
presumption
that
such
an
act
was
voluntary.
on
the
appellee's
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
it
specifically
stated
that
assuming
the
district
court
had
applied
the
proper
standard
or
proof,
the
record
fully
supported
its
findings
that
appellee
had
voluntarily
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico.
and
it
recognized
that
the
standards
that
the
district
court
had
applied
were
those
that
the
statute
commanded
it
to
apply.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
clause,
as
construed
by
this
court
in
afroyim
v.
rusk,
required
that
the
government
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
appellee
had
voluntarily
committed
an
expatriating
act,
and
that
he
had
done
so
with
the
specific
intent
of
relinquishing
his
citizenship.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
those
are
two
different
issues,
mr.
justice,
in
our
view.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
evidence
in
this
case
met
the
higher
standard
of
proof
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
formulated.
and
the
united
states
took
this
appeal
to
this
court.
the
questions
that
this
court
must
decide
are
three.
first,
whether
an
act
of
expatriation
to
be
valid,
as
such,
must
be
undertaken
with
a
specific
intent
to
surrender
american
citizenship,
or
whether,
as
we
contend,
a
citizen
may
lose
his
citizenship,
regardless
of
his
specific
intent,
if
he
voluntarily
performs
an
act
that
is
both
designated
by
congress
as
expatriating
and
that
inherently
manifests
a
transfer
of
allegiance
to
another
country,
that
is
inconsistent
with
retention
of
american
citizenship.
second,
whether
congress
may
constitutionally
provide,
as
it
has
done
in
8
ususc
1481(c),
that
in
a
lawsuit
where
loss
of
citizenship
is
at
issue,
the
party
claiming
expatriation
may
prove
such
expatriation
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
we
submit
that
such
a
standard
of
proof
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
it
was.
the
third
issue
that
this
court
must
decide
is
whether
congress
may
constitutionally
provide,
as
it
has
done
in
that
same
statute,
that
an
act
once
shown
to
have
been
done,
is
presumed
to
have
been
done
voluntarily,
unless
the
party
claiming
that
no
expatriation
has
occurred
shows
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it
was
not
done
voluntarily.
we
believe
that
such
a
presumption
is
constitutional,
at
least
on
the
assumption
that
expatriation
does
not
require
a
showing
of
specific
intent
to
surrender
citizenship.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
the
intent
matter
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
the
court
says
that
intent
is
essential,
the
case
is
not
over,
because
it
would
still
be
--
following
the
court
of
appeals'
remand,
it
would
still
be
available
to
show
that
that
test
was
met
here.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
affirmed.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
if
this
court
holds
that
specific
intent
is
required,
i
think
it
then
becomes
necessary
to
address
the
other
two
issues,
for
this
reason.
the
statute
says
that
voluntariness
must
be
shown
by
a
preponderance.
and
it
says
that
the
voluntariness
of
the
act
is
presumed,
unless
shown
to
the
contrary
by
a
preponderance.
the
question
then
would
become
does
voluntariness,
in
that
context,
mean
specific
intent?
if
it
does
mean
specific
intent,
then
the
case
is
over
in
this
court.
it
is
our
contention
that
voluntariness
does
not
have
that
meaning,
and
that
the
court
has
consistently
rejected
any
suggestion
that
it
does.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
but
in
afroyim
the
voting
in
a
foreign
election
was
not
an
act
which
demonstrated
a
transfer
of
allegiance
to
any
other
country.
our
position
is
that
before
one
looks
at
afroyim
one
should
look
at
chief
justice
warren's
dissent
in
perez,
because
the
court
in
afroyim
specifically
approved
that
dissent,
in
announcing
its
holding.
perez
was,
like
afroyim,
a
case
where
a
citizen
had
voted
in
a
foreign
election
and
this
court,
sharply
divided,
held
that
was
sufficient
to
expatriate
him
under
the
statute,
as
an
exercise
of
congress'
power
over
foreign
affairs.
chief
justice
warren
dissented,
in
a
lengthy
dissent,
which
recognized
what
chief
justice
warren
called
the
"long-recognized
principle
that
citizenship
may
be
lost
not
only
by
explicit
renunciation,
but
by
other
actions
in
derogation
of
undivided
allegiance
to
this
country.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
including
in
this
country
up
until
1928.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
a
situation
where
he
was
doing
it
in
an
undercover
capacity
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
some
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
voluntary
in
that
case,
because
it
would
be
done
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
and
it
may
have
been
something
that
he
was
directed
to
do.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
it
could
be
subject
to
that
very
narrow
category
of
extrinsic
means
of
showing
that
it
was
not
a
free
and
voluntary
act.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
that
were
the
case,
i
think
that
the
state
department,
on
reviewing
that
sort
of
submission,
would
say
to
him,
"look,
you
can
have
one
or
the
other.
you
can
be
a
mexican
citizen
or
an
american
citizen.
which
shall
it
be?
you
cannot
take
this
oath
--"
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
what
the
state
department
would
do
in
that
situation,
if
they
were
--
in
the
first
place,
it
would
be
done,
if
the
individual
wanted,
with
a
hearing,
at
least
at
the
appeal
stage.
so
they
would
have
the
opportunity
to
have
this
evidence.
but
if
it
were
contradictory
in
that
nature,
they
would
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
it
was
clearly
his
--
if
that
was
his
understanding,
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
irrelevant.
but
the
problem
is
that
the
state
department
does
not
want
to
go
around
revoking
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
he
was,
by
birth.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
his
father
was
a
mexican
citizen,
and
under
mexican
law,
he
therefore
was
also
a
citizen.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
white,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
made
myself
clear
in
answering
your
question
earlier.
if
the
court
should
decide,
contrary
to
our
submission,
that
specific
intent
is
an
element
of
voluntariness,
it
would
still,
in
our
view,
have
to
address
the
other
two
questions,
namely
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
both
of
them,
although
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
would
not
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumption
in
those
circumstances.
but
the
question
would
still
be
whether
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
required
of
voluntariness,
or
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional.
and
we
presume
the
court
would
address
the
presumption,
even
though
we
don't
defend
it.
i
think
our
position
is
best
stated
by
chief
justice
warren
in
his
dissent
in
the
perez
case,
which
as
i
noted
was
specifically
approved
by
the
court
in
afroyim.
we
think
that
this
court
should
recognize,
as
chief
justice
warren
did,
and
i
quote
"the
principle
that
conduct
of
a
citizen
showing
a
voluntary
transfer
of
allegiance
is
an
abandonment
of
citizenship,
and
thus
that
any
action
defined
by
statute
by
which
the
citizen
manifests
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state
may
be
so
inconsistent
with
retention
of
citizenship
as
to
result
in
a
loss
of
that
status.
"if
the
conduct
described
in
the
statute
manifests
what
chief
justice
warren
called
a
"dilution
of
undivided
allegiance
sufficient
to
show
voluntary
abandonment
of
citizenship,"
then
the
government
may
give
formal
recognition
to
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
citizen's
own
acts
without
regard
to
specific
intent.
we
submit
that
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
government
is
such
conduct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
first
issue,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
whether
specific
intent
is
a
necessary
element
of
an
expatriating
act.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
that
--
in
our
view,
that
question
has
to
be
addressed
before
the
burden
of
proof
issue
is
addressed.
in
our
view,
that
is
the
touchstone
of
the
perez
dissent
and
the
court's
opinion
in
afroyim,
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
follow
here.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
he
did,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
under
mexican
law,
mexico,
like
united
states,
does
not
favor
dual
citizenship,
and
it
has
this
certificate
of
mexican
nationality
which
formally
recognizes
the
individual
as
a
citizen
of
mexico.
but
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
it
requires
him
to
surrender
his
allegiance
to
any
other
country,
particularly
that
of
which
he
is
also
a
national.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
change
the
status
quo
of
his
dual
nationality?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
he
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
as
a
dual
national,
his
allegiance
is
in
something
of
a
tension.
he
owes
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
fact,
he
was
a
dual
national,
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
not
before
this
act,
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
testified
that
he
believed
that
he
had
to
sign
this
certificate,
or
this
application
for
mexican
nationality,
in
order
to
graduate
from
the
college
that
he
was
attending.
now
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
says
that
was
not
so,
but
regardless
of
that
his
testimony
was
that
he
believed
he
could
not
graduate
from
the
school
unless
he
signed
this
application
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
bears
on
it
because
by
applying
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality,
by
swearing
his
allegiance
to
mexico,
he
demonstrates
that
he
allegiance
to
the
united
states
is
certainly
divided,
and
in
fact
nonexistent.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
assume
he
did.
as
a
national
of
mexico,
i
assume
he
did.
but
he,
for
whatever
reason,
he
thought
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
as
i
answered
to
mr.
justice
stevens
earlier,
we
are
not
relying
on
that
as
the
basis,
because
the
statute,
as
we
describe,
i
believe,
on
page
48
of
our
brief,
has
four
or
five
specific
expatriating
acts.
renunciation
of
citizenship
is
one
of
them,
but
--
on
which
we
are
not
relying.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
i
would
call
that
renunciation.
i
don't
know
that
i
wouldn't.
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
specific
act
that
he
did
in
furtherance
of
this
election.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
yes,
sir.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
provision
of
united
states
law
that
says
a
dual
national
has
to
elect
at
some
point
with
one
or
the
other.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
as
a
dual
national,
there
probably
was
not
much
that
mexico
could
do.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
was
subject
to
the
draft
and,
in
fact,
he
was
given
a
physical
at
one
point,
and
was
subject
to
the
normal
process
of
the
draft.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
assume
he
would
be
in
some
sort
of
trouble,
yes,
sir.
he
was
in
mexico,
and,
in
fact,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
he
did
respond.
he
did
come
up
and
take
his
physical,
and
so
forth.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
under
mexican
law
he
does
have
some
obligations
to
mexico.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
dual
nationality
is
not
a
particularly
favored
status
in
any
country.
but
in
this
case,
as
the
consul
told
him,
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
it.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
on
page
38,
that
is
the
affidavit
that
the
appellee
signed
before
the
consul
when
he
came
back
with
the
forms
that
the
consul
had
given
him
to
be
sent
up
to
the
state
department
for
a
final
determination
of
his
nationality.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
does
use
that
phrase.
there
are
other
statements
that
he
made
at
the
same
time,
in
which
he
said,
"i
have
no
intention
of
giving
up
my
citizenship."
they
are
just
squarely
contradictory.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
was
not
sworn,
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
state
department
did
resolve
it,
although
the
exact
weight
that
they
placed
on
intention
i
don't
know.
but
they
resolved
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
remanded
this
case
to
the
district
court,
because
it
also
has
not
passed
on
these
conflicting
statements
of
intention.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
say
that
it
was
done
for
that
purpose.
it
was
done
to
forward
his
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
purpose,
i
believe,
was
to
give
the
state
department
a
basis
to
determine
whether
he
had
voluntarily
committed
an
expatriating
act
or
not.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
does
say
that.
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
we
don't
rely
on
it
in
this
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
finding
on
that
issue
when
it
faced
the
case.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
were
other
statements
that
were
executed
at
the
same
time
which
are
squarely
contrary.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
sir,
at
the
same
time.
this
is
the
affidavit.
he
also
answered
some
questions
in
a
questionnaire,
and
he
also
wrote
out
a
letter
in
his
own
hand,
all
of
which,
the
three
documents,
the
affidavit
and
the
questionnaire
and
the
letter,
were
all
sent
to
the
state
department
at
the
same
time.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
other
statements
are
not
sworn
to,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
this
court
should
hold
that
intent
is
required,
it
may
well
be
that
we
will
argue
in
the
district
court
that
there
is
all
the
evidence
of
intent
that
is
needed.
but
we
have
not
taken
that
position
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
announced
this
requirement
in
this
case
for
the
first
time,
and
then
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
findings
of
fact
on
that
issue.
we
did
not
want
to
come
up
here
and
ask
this
court
to
make
findings
of
fact
as
to
whether
he
did
or
did
not
have
an
intention,
when
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
done
so
and,
in
fact,
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
precisely
that
purpose,
stating
that
credibility
was
an
issue.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
determination
is
made
in
the
first
instance
on
the
papers
that
are
submitted,
and
then
there
is
an
administrative
appeal
if
the
individual
wants
it,
in
which
there
is
live
testimony
taken.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
trial
in
the
district
court
was
de
novo.
it
was
not
a
review
of
the
state
department
record.
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
a
de
novo
trial,
and
that
was
done
here.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
the
status
of
this
exhibit
14a.
but
before
i
do
that,
i
would
like
to
be
very
frank
with
this
court
as
to
the
precise
problem
that
the
united
states
sees
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
that
decision,
as
i
stated,
requires
that
the
united
states
prove,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
a
specific
intent
to
surrender
citizenship.
it
is
the
combination
of
those
two
requirements
that
creates
the
dilemma
to
which
i
referred
earlier.
should
this
court
hold,
as
we
believe
it
should,
that
specific
intent
is
not
an
element
of
expatriation
and
that
expatriation
can
arise
regardless
of
specific
intent,
if
the
citizen
performs
voluntarily
a
statutorily
designated
act
that
demonstrates
a
transfer
of
allegiance,
then
in
all
candor,
i
must
state
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
applied
to
proving
the
commission
of
the
act
of
expatriation
itself
is
not
an
intolerable
burden.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
the
business
of
both,
because
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
who
is
a
citizen
and
who
is
not.
it
cannot
depend
on
the
subjective
intent
of
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
government
cannot
strip
his
citizenship
away
from
him.
that
is
afroyim.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
not,
respectfully,
what
afroyim
holds
in
our
view,
and
we
ask
the
court
not
to
hold
that
now.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
second
circuit
and
this
seventh
circuit
both
have.
the
ninth
and
the
fifth
circuit
look
the
other
way,
we
think,
although
it
is
not
a
square
holding.
we
discuss
those
cases
in
our
brief.
it
is
the
standard
of
proof
here
applied
in
conjunction
with
the
specific
intent
requirement
that
creates
the
tough
problem.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
we
don't
believe
afroyim
is
wrong
and
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
cut
back
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because,
unlike
voting
in
a
foreign
election,
swearing
allegiance
to
another
government,
especially
when
that
is
done
in
the
context
of
renouncing
united
states
citizenship,
is
an
act
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
we
said
that
circumstance
would
be
taken
into
account.
but
even
if
it
is
ignored,
we
think
that
swearing
allegiance
to
a
foreign
government
is
an
act
intrinsically
different
from
simply
voting
in
a
foreign
election.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
chief
justice
warren,
sir,
that
i
read
that
statement
as
coming
from.
in
his
statement
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
was,
but
that
dissent
later
became
the
basis
for
afroyim.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
was
the
same
case
as
perez,
but
chief
justice
warren,
in
his
dissent
in
perez,
said
that
there
is
a
difference
between
voting
in
a
foreign
election
and
naturalizing
one's
self
in
a
foreign
state.
that
was
the
particular
example
he
used.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
would
have
come
out
differently,
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
yes.
the
individual
there
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
under
mexican
law
there
are
certain
things
that
can
be
done
only
by
a
person
holding
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
it
is
an
official
solemn
document
that
you
are
a
full-fledged
citizen
of
mexico.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
he
was
a
dual
national.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are
certain
things
that
a
dual
national
cannot
do
in
mexico,
even
though
he
--
half
of
his
legal
nationality
is
mexican.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
am
referring
to
certain
acts
--
and
i
don't
have
them
specifically
at
hand,
but
there
is
testimony
in
the
record,
in
the
documents,
that
the
mexican
government
requires
that
those
who
are
born
dual
nationals
have
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality
in
order
to
carry
out
certain
things.
for
example.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
and
so
he
proceeded
to
be
in
his
interest
to
take
out
the
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it,
apparently,
was
not
sufficiently
a
fact
to
the
mexican
government.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
he
was
not
preserving
the
status
quo.
he
was
pledging
his
whole
obedience
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
can
make
--
i
will
tell
you
precisely
what
my
position
is
on
that
argument.
the
statute
says
renouncing
united
states
citizenship
before
a
united
states
officer,
that
is
an
expatriating
act.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
so
the
government
does
not
rely
on
the
statute
that
says
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
say
yes
right
now.
the
only
significance
that
that
renunciation
has
in
the
context
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
a
piece
of
evidence
which
the
state
department
and
the
courts
could
consider
along
with
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case,
to
determine
just
what
happened
here.
it
is
not
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
renunciation
is
an
independent
legal
basis,
because
it
doesn't
fit
the
statute.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
may
make
it
a
stronger
case
for
expatriation,
but
it
does
not
change
the
legal
basis
on
which
the
expatriation
occurs,
which
is
the
swearing
of
allegiance,
not
the
renunciation
of
mexican
citizenship.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
we
are
saying
that
intent
is
not
needed.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
we
lose
on
that,
then
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
as
i
said
before
lunch,
if
we
lose
on
that
issue
we
may
well
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
say
the
intent
is
here.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
finding
on
that
issue,
and
we
did
not
think
it
proper
to
come
up
and
argue
to
this
court
that
it
should
make
a
finding,
which
is
in
fact
what
i
believe
the
appellee
is
doing,
asking
this
court
to
rewrite
the
record
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
evidence
of
his
intent
to
surrender
his
american
citizenship.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
certainly
argue
that
in
the
district
court,
if
it
comes
to
that,
yes,
sir,
whether
it
is
ultimately
persuasive
or
not.
it
is
not
the
only
statement
of
intent.
there
are
contrary
statements,
and
that
is
a
matter
for
the
district
judge
to
make
findings
on
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
with
the
court's
leave,
i
could
explain
the
situation
of
exhibit
14,
although
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is.
it
is
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
court.
the
original
exhibits
are
there.
what
happened
is,
14
and
14a
are
both
copies
of
a
preprinted
form
called
the
questionnaire,
designed
to
find
out
what
happened
in
an
allegedly
expatriating
act.
the
vice
consul,
in
this
case,
when
he
first
met
the
appellee
said,
"here,
take
this
questionnaire
back
home
and
fill
it
out
and
bring
it
back
to
us."
the
appellee
did
so.
he
came
back
and
he
filled
it
out.
unfortunately,
although
not
unreasonably,
he
proceeded
on
the
answering
the
questions
as
if
he
had
been
naturalized
as
a
mexican
citizen,
which
in
fact
he
was
not.
he
was
a
mexican
citizen
by
birth.
the
consular
officer,
the
consular
assistant,
maria
ibarra,
testified
and
this
is
all
in
the
record.
there
is
no
svengali
influence
here
that
she
sat
down
with
mr.
terrazas
and
she
went
through
question
by
question.
she
said,
"actually,
you
are
not
a
naturalized
citizen,
you
are
a
native-born
citizen,
so
this
question
shouldn't
be
answered."
she
went
through
page
by
page
while
he
was
there.
he
never
said
anything
in
response.
he
just
took
her
instructions
as
to
the
proper
way
of
filling
out
the
form.
she
said,
"fine,
now
that
you
understand
it,
please
take
this
fresh
form
home
and
complete
it
with
the
correct
questions
answered",
which
he
did.
none
of
this
business
about,
"i
feel
more
mexican
than
american,"
and
so
forth,
was
ever
dictated
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
by
anyone
in
the
consul.
the
record
simply
doesn't
support
that.
the
question
of
treason.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
anyone
told
him
that
he
was
committing
a
treasonous
act.
in
fact,
the
vice
consul
flatly
and
repeatedly
denied
that
he
had
ever
said
any
such
thing.
the
only
place
that
ever
shows
up
is
in
various
statements
outside
the
record,
or
outside
the
trial
testimony
that
the
appellee
has
made.
i
would
be
distressed
if
this
court
were
to
characterize
the
record
as
my
opponent
has
characterized
it,
because
i
think
those
facts
are
simply
not
in
the
record.
the
record
is
a
four-volume
transcript,
and
a
number
of
documents
which
we
believe
are
self-explanatory.
this
appellee
was
not
forced
or
coerced
or
hounded
by
any
employee.
