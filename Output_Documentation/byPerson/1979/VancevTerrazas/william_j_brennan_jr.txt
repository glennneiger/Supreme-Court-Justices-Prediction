brennan,

would
he
have
lost
his
mexican
citizenship
if
he
had
never
signed
an
oath
of
allegiance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

then
i
share
my
brother,
stewart's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
have
gone
through
his
entire
life
being
a
citizen
of
each
country?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
particularly
for
a
person
who
is
a
citizen
already.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
you
don't
is,
as
my
brother
white
has
already
said,
you
haven't
relied
on
that
throughout
--
