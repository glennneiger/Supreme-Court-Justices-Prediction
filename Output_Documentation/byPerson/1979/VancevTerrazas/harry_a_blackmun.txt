mr.
ryan,
what
was
the
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
just
have
before
me
--
so
i
have
an
advantage
over
you
who
don't
have
before
you
--
the
court's
opinion
in
afroyim
v.
rusk.
there
is
constant
use
and
reuse
of
the
phrase
"voluntary
renunciation."
and,
of
course,
in
afroyim,
as
you
all
know,
the
voting
in
the
election
in
israel
was
a
totally
voluntary
act.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
he
held
that
voting
in
the
--
he
thought
that
voting
in
the
mexican
elections
was
not
an
act
in
derogation
of
undivided
allegiance
to
the
united
states?
