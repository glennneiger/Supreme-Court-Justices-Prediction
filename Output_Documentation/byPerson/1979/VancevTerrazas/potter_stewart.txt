justice

stewart
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
affirmed.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
wouldn't
reed
to
reach
the
other
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
is
that
several
states,
historically,
have
allowed
aliens
to
vote
in
their
elections.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean,
in
this
country.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fact
is
he
already
was
a
citizen
of
mexico,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
as
indicated
by
my
question
before
lunch,
what
bothers
me
in
this
case
is
the
applicability
of
this
statute
to
this
particular
case.
this
person
already
was
a
citizen
of
mexico
and
owed
allegiance
to
mexico,
therefore.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
particular
case,
why
did
his
statement
of
his
allegiance
to
mexico
change
the
status
quo
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
before
he
signed
anything,
this
person,
mr.
terrazas,
was
a
citizen
of
mexico,
owed
allegiance,
as
such,
to
mexico,
was
also
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
and
owed
allegiance,
as
such,
to
the
united
states.
and
whether
either
mexico
or
the
united
states
individual
nationality,
he
was
a
citizen
of
each
state,
of
each
country.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
why
did
this
signing
of
an
oath
of
allegiance,
or
an
affirmation
of
allegiance
to
mexico
change
the
status
quo
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
why
did
that
add
anything
to
what
he
already
owed?
he
was
a
citizen
of
mexico.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely,
but
in
fact
he
was,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
didn't
he
already
owe
allegiance
to
mexico
if
he
was
a
citizen
of
mexico?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
not
relying
at
all
on
his
renunciation
of
united
states
citizenship
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
14a
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
document
14a?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
it
here
in
any
of
these
papers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
we
have
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
"appendix
to
brief
for
the
appellee."
justice
potter
stewart
afroyim
was
voting
in
a
foreign
election.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
one
who
swore
allegiance
was
already
a
citizen
of
that
government?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
it
be
that
if
you
are
already
a
citizen
of
mexico
that
a
certificate
stating
that
you
are
a
citizen
of
mexico
changes
the
status?
justice
potter
stewart
he
already
was.
justice
potter
stewart
my
only
question
is
how
in
this
case,
at
least,
can
it
be
considered
to
be
inconsistent
with
american
citizenship
to
simply
preserve
the
status
quo?
