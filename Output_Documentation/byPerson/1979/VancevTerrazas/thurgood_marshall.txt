you
say
it
doesn't
exist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
it
wasn't
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
have
dual
citizenship,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
giving
up
one
there,
isn't
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
you
do
something
there,
that
if
you
just
had
one
citizenship
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
that
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
file
that
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
almost
has
dual
citizenship.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
a
theory
that
you
pull
down
out
of
the
clear
blue,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
pull
down,
quote,
"dual
citizenship,"
end
quote,
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
something
when
you
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
he
meant
something
when
he
said
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
meant
that
he
was
giving
up
the
dual
citizenship.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
he
didn't
mean
what
he
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ditkowsky,
you
said
that
you
didn't
know,
and
none
of
us
knew,
what
brought
all
this
about.
could
it
have
been
that
they
found
out
that
he
was
in
mexico
posing
as
a
mexican
citizen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure
that's
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
proves
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
his
uncle
was
a
big
mexican
official.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
the
great
treason
they
are
talking
about?
