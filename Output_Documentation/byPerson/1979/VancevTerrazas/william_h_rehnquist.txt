h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
renunciation,
do
you
include
with
that
the
election
that
comes
--
that
most
dual
citizens
have
to
make
sometime
in
their
lifetime
--
and,
as
i
understand,
under
united
states
law,
as
well
--
to
choose
one
or
the
other
citizenship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
laws
of
the
united
states
provide
that
a
dual
national
has
to
elect
at
sometime
or
other
during
his
lifetime,
after
he
reaches
21,
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
to
be
resolved
by
the
state
department?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
state
department
have
a
fact-finding
process
for
determining
these
things,
or
do
they
go
directly,
de
novo,
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
facts
were
found
there,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
addington,
someone
was
being
incarcerated.
your
client
is
not
being
incarcerated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
just
a
lot
of
kind
of
rhetoric,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
is
not
forbidden
to
move
any
number
of
places
that
he
wants
to
the
way
the
person
in
addington
was
who
was
confined
within
the
walls
of
an
institution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
can
go
anywhere
else
in
the
world
he
wants
to,
can't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
he
come
in
here
with
a
visa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
would
say
this
proof
has
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
have
any
case
if
perez
v.
brownell
were
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
afroyim
overruled
perez.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
saying
if
perez
v.
brownell
were
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
thing
that
you
sent
into
the
court,
the
green
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
certainly
doesn't
comply
with
our
rules
as
to
size
or
anything
else,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
relying
on
14a
for
something,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
concede
that
it
can
be
an
act
voluntarily
done,
inconsistent
with
allegiance
to
the
country,
without
necessarily
also
having
the
intent,
specific
intent,
to
renounce
citizenship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
is
intent
to
do
the
act,
but
not
the
intent
to
specifically
renounce
citizenship.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
enlisting
in
the
army
of
a
foreign
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
where
there
is
no
coercion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
expatriation
in
perez
v.
brownell?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
finding
there
that
it
was
done
with
the
conscious
intent
to
relinquish
citizenship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
enlist
in
the
mexican
army,
you
may
be
ordered
to
invade
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
ever
make
any
effort
to
send
it
back
when
he
saw
that
it
contained
a
renunciation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
still
say
that
if
in
afroyim
there
were
two
people
and
one
of
them
had
voted
and
one
of
them
had
sworn
allegiance,
the
two
cases
would
have
come
out
differently.
