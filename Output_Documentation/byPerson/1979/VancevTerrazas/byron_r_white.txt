justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan,
does
the
record
show
whether
he
was
or
was
not
fluent
in
spanish?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
those
are
two
different
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
the
intent
in
the
matter,
the
case
is
over
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
namely,
if
we
say
that
intent
is
essential.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
is
over
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
submission
is,
i
suppose,
that
if
afroyim
had
done
two
things,
voted
in
the
foreign
election
and
sworn
allegiance
to
another
country,
that
he
would
no
longer
be
a
citizen?
do
you
think
the
court
would
have
upheld
the
one
but
not
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
under
your
submission
if
the
cia
agent
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
to,
say,
cuba,
so
he
could
perform
his
duties
well,
but
did
not
intend
to
give
up
his
american
citizenship,
he
would
nevertheless
give
up
his
american
citizenship?
because
it
would
be
clearly
an
oath
of
allegiance,
a
specific
expatriating
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
did
it
voluntarily,
just
as
this
man
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
submission,
your
basic
submission
is
here,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
his
intent
was,
i
take
it,
even
if
you
conceded
that
he
did
not
intend
to
give
up
his
united
states
citizenship,
he
nevertheless
has
done
so
by
swearing
allegiance
to
mexico.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
affidavit
executed
for
the
purpose
of
making
clear
that
he
was
not
subject
to
draft
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
forward
papers
without
swearing
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it
must
have
had
some
purpose.
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
purpose
was
to
tell
the
state
department
that
he
had
intentionally
relinquished
his
citizenship
in
the
united
states?
that's
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
resist?
yes,
why
don't
you
rely
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
finding
do
you
need
in
face
of
that
affidavit?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
statements
subsequent
to
this
that
are
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
questionnaire
has,
as
i
think
you
pointed
out,
conflicting
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
not
sworn
to,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
this
affidavit
doesn't
settle
this
case.
if
intent
is
requisite,
and
if
an
act
may
be
evidence
of
intent,
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
on
the
surface
--
perhaps
i
don't
understand
it
--
that
you
have
both
here.
he
went
to
mexico,
went
to
school
there,
swore
in
a
document
that
hasn't
been
repudiated,
so
far
as
i
know,
that
it
was
his
intention
to
relinquish
his
united
states
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
your
client
sign
the
affidavit
mr.
justice
powell
referred
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
question
of
voluntariness
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
twenty-two,
college
educated,
fluent
in
spanish?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
all
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
affidavit
--
and
i
go
back
to
it
--
was
in
november
of
'71.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
was
a
year
older.
justice
byron
r.
white
"i
further
swear
the
act
mentioned
above
was
my
free
and
voluntary
act,
and
that
no
influence,
compulsion,
force
or
duress
was
exerted
upon
me
by
any
other
person,
and
that
it
was
done
with
the
intention
of
relinquishing
my
united
states
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
tell
us
in
this
document
where
14a
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
went
to
school
down
in
mexico?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
raise
any
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision
that
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
power
shall
be
an
expatriating
act,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
one
can
be
a
citizen
of
more
than
one
country
at
a
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
if
your
basic
position
is
right
that
you
must
prove
specific
intent
to
relinquish
citizenship,
that
the
basic
underlying
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
it
follows
logically,
if
we
should
adopt
your
position,
because
one
can
be
a
citizen
of
two
countries.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
must
prove
specific
intent
to
renounce
and
so
forth,
and
if
you
fail
to
prove
that
the
mere
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
another
country
should
not
be
the
constitutionally
permissible
basis
for
revoking
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan,
under
prior
cases,
is
it
any
of
the
government's
business
to
say
what
--
when
and
under
what
circumstances
a
citizen
loses
his
citizenship?
i
thought
that
was
the
business
of
the
citizen
to
give
up
his
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought,
arguably
at
least,
on
the
prior
cases,
a
citizen
doesn't
give
up
his
citizenship
against
his
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
he
actually
knows
that
--
at
the
minimum,
he
actually
knows
that
some
act
that
he
is
performing
is
--
well,
unless
he
intends
to
give
up
his
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
gotten
much
help
out
of
the
court
of
appeals,
have
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
courts
of
appeals
all
read
afroyim
that
way,
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
afroyim
was
just
wrong?
here
the
united
states
said
voting
in
a
foreign
election
is
an
act
which
the
government
says
amounts
to
a
renunciation
of
your
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
should
you
be
able
to
say
that
swearing
allegiance
to
a
foreign
government
is
a
renunciation
of
your
citizenship?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
your
argument.
you
don't
even
make
that
argument,
apparently,
that
swearing
allegiance
in
connection
with
renunciation
makes
it
stronger
than
if
you
just
swore
allegiance.
that
isn't
the
way
you
cast
your
argument,
is
it?
certainly
not
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that's
what
the
government
says
that
act
should
mean.
i
thought
afroyim,
at
least
arguably,
says
that
we
really
have
to
have
some
proof
of
what
the
man
subjectively
intended
by
this
act,
not
what
some
government
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
chief
justice
warren
was
in
dissent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't,
because
that
wasn't
the
issue
in
afroyim,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan,
why
don't
you
use
the
argument
you
have
already
used
in
part,
that
because
in
this
case
he
not
only
swore
allegiance,
but
the
same
as
said,
"and
furthermore
i
intend
by
this
swearing
of
allegiance
to
renounce
my
citizenship."
justice
byron
r.
white
he
does
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
asked
you
--
there
are
two
parts
to
this
document,
one,
an
oath
of
allegiance,
and
second,
renunciation
language.
would
it
be
the
same
legal
issue
here
if
we
left
out
the
second
half
of
the
document
and
you
said
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hope
that's
the
rule.
what
if
we
need
an
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do,
but
what
if
you
lose
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
say
that
intent
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
provides
about
a
person
who
is
a
national
of
the
united
states.
he
will
lose
his
nationality
if
he
takes
a
note
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state.
the
act
also
provides
that
proof
shall
be
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
that
the
voluntariness
of
the
oath
shall
be
resumed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
citizenship
could
not
be
lost
absent
proof
of
an
intent
to
surrender
it.
it
also
invalidated
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
presumption
as
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
prescribe.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
government's
appeal.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
proof
of
an
intent
to
surrender
citizenship
is
necessary
if
citizenship
is
to
be
lost
under
this
section.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
however,
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
presumption
of
voluntariness.
we
think
that
those
provisions
are
within
the
power
of
congress
to
prescribe.
we
accordingly
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
each
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
also
dissents
for
the
reason
stated
in
part
ii
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion.
