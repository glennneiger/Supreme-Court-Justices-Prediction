mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
to
be
determined,
as
we
understand
it,
is
whether
a
native-born
american
citizen
can
be
denaturalized
or
denuded
of
his
american
citizenship
by
a
minimum
standard
of
proof,
equal
to
or
less
than
that
of
a
simple
negligence
case.
we
believe
also
that
addington
v.
texas
is
espoused
under
this
particular
issue.
the
court
considered
the
applicability
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
standard
of
proof
in
addington.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
when
you
talk
about
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
when
the
reviewing
court
looks
at
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
reviewing
court
looks
to
determine
if
there
is
one
scintilla
of
evidence
that
would
sustain
the
verdict
of
the
district
court.
if
they
find
that
scintilla
of
evidence,
then
they
sustain
the
verdict.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
preponderance.
that's
the
reason
i
use
the
word
"less."
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
our
client
is
worse
than
being
incarcerated.
our
client
is
losing
the
right
to
have
rights,
the
most
valued
right
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
is
not
only
confined
--
he
is
confined
without
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
because
not
being
a
citizen
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
american
citizenship.
he
could
very
well
be
barred
from
entry
into
the
country.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
was
born
here,
he
is
a
native-born
american.
he
was
born
within
sight
of
this
courthouse.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
but
that
is
still
a
matter
of
privilege.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
right,
and
it
takes
away
the
most
valued
right
that
the
courts
have
consistently
held,
from
afroyim,
nishikawa,
perez,
you
name
it.
the
courts
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
would
like
to
see
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
like
to
see
the
most
stringent
proof
required,
rather
than
the
standard
of
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocable.
as
pointed
out
in
the
addington
case,
there
were
three
standards
of
proof
that
were
determined.
the
first
standard
of
proof
was
the
minimum
standard,
which
was
preponderance.
this
involves
cases
where
society
really
doesn't
have
much
at
stake.
then
you
have
the
cases
where
society
has
a
great
deal
at
stake,
and
cases
in
which
the
risk
of
error
can't
be
tolerated.
those
primarily
are
the
criminal
cases.
then
you
have
the
middle
ground
cases,
and
they
are
divided
into
two
basic
sections.
the
first
section
is
the
private
case,
where
you
have
civil
fraud
and
action
to
declare
a
child
born
in
wedlock
illegitimate,
an
action
to
enforce
an
oral
contract
to
make
a
bequest.
to
these
we
apply
the
standard
of
clear
and
convincing.
then
we
have
the
more
public
cases
which
addington
talked
about,
the
deportation
case,
the
naturalization
case,
the
civil
commitment
case,
and
we
believe
the
expatriation
case.
important
here
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
reason
my
client
signed
the
affidavit
was
he
was
frightened.
this
is
a
young
man
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes
sir,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
we
have
to
go
back
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no.
our
client
signed
the
affidavit
--
our
client
signed
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality
in
his
home
in
niles,
michigan,
sometime
in
1970.
we've
got
a
number
of
dates.
counsel
this
morning
said
september
1970.
mrs.
ibarra
testified
november
1970.
the
court
found
august
3rd,
mr.
parson
said
april
3rd.
we
don't
even
know
when
the
event
occurred.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
was
presented
--
the
district
court
--
was
presented
with
another
application
for
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
this
certificate
of
mexican
nationality
did
not
even
bear
the
plaintiff's
signature.
this
had
his
name
spelled
wrong,
and
the
name
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
unfortunately,
that
is
not
a
true
statement
of
what
actually
occurred.
this
young
man
came
to
the
consulate
office,
after
having
been
at
a
party.
he
was
told
that
he
had
committed
an
overt
act
of
treason
and
he
had
to
go
to
the
government,
the
consulor
--
c-o-n-s-u-l
rather
than
c-o-u-n-s-e-l
to
get
a
determination
of
citizenship.
the
documents
he
signed
said
"registration."
this
young
man
was
frightened,
his
father
had
died
a
short
while
before
this,
and
he
put
himself
in
their
hands
and
he
signed
the
documents.
you
can
see
if
you
look
at
exhibit
14a
exactly
the
type
of
pressure
that
he
was
under.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
cited
in
afroyim.
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
would
think
so.
i
think
that
even
with
perez
v.
brownell
being
the
law,
we
have
a
different
act
involved.
we
still
are
involved
with
the
question
of
standard
of
proof
to
be
involved.
the
standard
of
proof
that's
required
proves
its
voluntariness
perez
v.
brownell
did
not
abrogate
the
standard
of
voluntariness.
so,
the
first
step
is
to
prove
voluntariness.
the
second
step
is
to
prove
what,
in
fact,
he
did.
and
these
burdens
are
on
the
government.
in
order
to
prove
what
anybody
did,
you
have
to
prove
certain
things.
one,
intent
two,
what
happened,
where
it
happened,
who
was
present.
you've
got
to
prove
some
kind
of
foundation.
the
record
here
is
totally
devoid
of
any
foundation.
and
when
we
look
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
look
at
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
indicated
by
the
afroyim
case,
the
intention
of
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
prevent
exactly
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case.
and
getting
back
to
addington
again,
we
have
to
weigh
two
things.
what
error
can
we
constitutionally
allow
to
occur,
and
the
relative
importance
of
society.
and
we
submit
that
the
relative
importance
of
society
in
this
particular
situation
is
supreme.
we
also
point
out
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
i
personally
would
want
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
if
i
had
--
it
was
all
i
could
get
--
i
would
take
the
addington
standard.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
14a
is
not
reproduced.
fourteen
is
reproduced.
fourteen
is
the
product
of
14a.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
wrote
it
under
the
guidance
of
the
consular
officials.
fourteen
a
--
the
testimony
relative
to
the
14a
was
that
he
prepared
a
document,
and
then
a
consular
official,
who
happened
to
be
a
mexican
national,
proceeded
to
edit
that
document,
taking
out
many
of
his
statements.
one
of
the
statements
was
that
he
had
been
told
by
a
consular
official
that
he
had
committed
an
overt
act,
or
treasonable
act.
this
kid
was
scared
to
death.
he
believed
that
he
had
to
do
specifically
what
his
attorney
told
him,
what
his
consul
told
him.
and
on
that
basis,
because
of
the
fiduciary
relationship
that
was
imposed
on
him,
or
he
believed
it
had
occurred,
he
was
misled
and
led
to
sign
the
documents
that
were
not
in
accord
with
objective
reality.
this
should
not
be
sufficient
to
take
away
his
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
can
only
tell
you,
your
honor,
that
14a
has
a
particular
statement,
and
it
does
have
the
statement
that
he
had
been
told
by
a
consular
official
that
he
had
committed
an
overt
treasonable
act.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
14a
is
the
document
that
gave
rise
to
exhibit
14.
let
me
explain.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
14a
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
we
were
not
given
the
opportunity
to
add
to
the
appendix.
the
government
came
to
this
court
and
said
--
and
asked
this
court
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
it
should
be
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
it
is
not
in
any
of
these
papers.
the
printing
of
an
appendix
was
dispensed
with
upon
the
government's
motion.
then
the
government
proceeded
to
print
an
appendix
to
their
brief,
and
consequently
the
documents
that
we
asked
to
be
reproduced
and
the
sections
of
testimony
we
asked
to
be
reproduced
were
not,
in
fact
reproduced.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
when
we
asked
for
our
brief
to
be
printed,
we
did
have
documents
attached
to
that,
and
they
were
not
printed
with
them.
i
understand
they
were
photocopied
and
copies
of
some
of
those
documents
were
--
the
clerk
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
how
can
i
put
it?
when
i
sent
in
to
the
court
the
brief
for
the
appellant,
i
sent
in
a
document
that
had
exhibits
attached
to
it.
when
it
was
printed,
it
was
printed
without
adding
any
of
my
exhibits.
among
the
exhibits
that
i
had
attached
were
statements
of
mrs.
ibarra
taken
at
trial,
where
she
admitted
the
alteration
of
his
document
and
the
editing
of
his
document.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes,
this
is
a
photocopy
of
what
i
sent
into
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
we
were
granted
leave
to
proceed
as
a
pauper,
and
we
proceeded
to
send
in
our
brief
to
the
court
and
the
court
printed
our
brief.
and
what
came
out
was
this
brief
which
does
comply.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
i
sent
it
and
then
i
called
the
clerk's
office
afterwards
and
i
asked
the
clerk's
office
what
happened
to
my
exhibits
that
were
attached,
and
i
was
told
that
they
were
photocopied
and
copies
were
given
to
each
of
the
justices.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
assume
that
is
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no.
i
did
not
reproduce
14a
because
there
is
only
one
copy
of
14a,
and
14a
is
something
that
cannot
be
entirely
reproduced,
because
what
it
has
in
there
are
many
colored
pencil
marks
and
scratch
marks.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
you
still
can't
reproduce
the
colors.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes,
i
am
relying
upon
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
i
did
produce
many
of
the
pages
that
were
involved
in
14a.
i
did
not
reproduce
it,
but
i
did
have
testimony
in
connection
with
it,
and
i
reproduced
sections
of
the
testimony
where
it
was
discussed,
and
where
mrs.
ibarra
testified
as
to
what
she
had
done.
and
we
take
the
position
that
in
her
editing
his
document
she
showed
exactly
the
power
that
she
had
over
him,
or
that
the
consular
official
had
over
him.
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
reproduce
14a,
but
i
had
no
ability
to
do
so,
and.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
it
is
the
original
questionnaire
which
eventually
became
14,
fourteen
is
produced
for
the
court
by
the
appellant.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
it
exists
in
the
record.
there
is
only
one
copy
of
it.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no,
i
don't
have
it
in
the
documents
that
i
produced
for
the
court,
but
it
is
in
the
actual
trial
record
that
was
brought
into
this
court.
there
is
one
concession
that
is
made,
which
is
part
of
the
weighing
factor,
that
goes
along
with
the
statement
of
the
court
in
addington.
addington
made
a
statement
that
the
function
of
the
legal
process
and
the
burden
of
proof,
as
part
of
it,
was
to
minimize
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
decision.
on
page
16
of
mr.
vance's
jurisdictional
statement,
in
a
footnote
--
i
believe
footnote
11
--
mr.
vance
concedes
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
given
issue
may
be
dispositive
of
the
issue.
now,
expatriation
is
a
right
that
is
given
to
an
individual
citizen.
it
is
not
a
right
given
to
the
department
of
state
or
government.
it
is
a
right
which
must
be
exercised
voluntarily
by
the
citizen.
voluntary
means
--
it
means
voluntary,
it
doesn't
mean
equitous.
it
doesn't
mean
res
ipse
loquitor,
like
occurred
in
this
case.
it
does
not
mean
punishment
for
a
crime.
if
i
am
the
worst
person
in
the
world,
that's
no
right
to
take
away
my
citizenship.
punish
me
for
the
crime,
but
don't
take
away
my
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
if
there
is
no
intent
to
do
the
act,
it
can't
be
voluntary.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
you
can't
make
that
broad
a
statement.
if
congress
should
declare
that
wearing
a
red
shirt
should
be
an
act
of
expatriation,
the
red
shirt
has
no
relationship
to
citizenship.
consequently,
i
can
wear
a
red
shirt
until
the
sun
sets
in
the
east
and
still
i
will
not
do
an
act
which
i
should
be
expatriated
for.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
in
nishikawa
where
there
is
coercion,
absolutely
not.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
where
there
is
no
coercion?
we
have
allowed
americans
to
enlist
in
the
army
of
israel
and
we
have
not
expatriated
them.
we
have
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that
was
voting.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
the
court's
decision,
and
i
think
that
they
did
feel
that
that
was
such
an
act
that
it
did
have
a
conscious
intent,
because
the
fact
that
when
you
vote
in
a
foreign
election
--
if
i
were
to
vote
in
the
election
in
mexico,
for
instance,
i
would
be
involved
in
the
intimate
process
of
government
in
mexico,
and
that
is
pretty
good
evidence
of
being
an
interloper
or
of
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
that
is
a
problem
that
does
exist,
and
then
comes
the
question
of
coercion.
that's
the
reason
this
area
of
voluntariness
is
so
very
important.
that's
the
reason
we
really
have
to
determine
as
to
--
and
on
a
case
by
case
basis
--
what
the
act
was,
why
it
was
done,
where
it
was
done,
how
it
was
done,
and
who
was
present.
it
cannot
be
a
secret
type
of
situation.
it
cannot
be
a
situation
that
only
i
know
what
i
have
done,
only
you
and
i
know
what
i
have
done.
it
must
be
some
formal
act.
the
statute
itself
does
say
"formal."
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes.
when
you
have
dual
citizenship
--
when
i
have
dual
citizenship,
i
have
a
vested
right
in
both
my
american
citizenship
and
in
my
other
citizenship,
and
only
i
should
have
the
right
to
give
it
up
as
an
individual
and
as
a
member
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
right.
if
i
had
just
one
citizenship,
that's
true.
where
i
have
dual
citizenship,
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
haven't
made
any
change
in
my
statute.
mr.
terrazas
did
not
change
his
situation.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
only
explanation
for
it
is
stupidity,
or
the
indication
by
the
consular
official
that
this
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
as
one
lawyer
to
another,
what
we
have
in
many
situations
is,
the
lawyer
suggests
sometimes
the
manner
in
which
one
is
going
to
present
a
particular
fact
situation.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that
is
still
not
expatriation.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
they
may
sound
sincere,
but
they
are
not
necessarily
intent
of
giving
up
one's
citizenship.
i
like
swedish
cooking.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
does
have
dual
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
am
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
certainly.
he
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
did
not
intend
to
give
up
his
dual
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no,
he
did
not
intend
to
give
up
his
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
said
what
he
said
in
those
statements
because
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
that
was
the
thing
to
say,
that
was
what
the
department
of
state
wanted
to
hear.
so
he
said
it.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
believe
so,
because
he
was
told
that
he
had
committed
an
overt
act
of
treason
against
the
united
states
government.
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
go
home.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
act?
we
don't
know
what
the
act
was.
it
may
very
well
have
been
a
third
person's
act.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
forged
application
for
citizen
of
mexican
nationality
did
not
promulgate
the
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
when
mr.
terrazas
appeared
at
the
consulate
in
monterey,
mexico,
and
he
told
mr.
parsons
that
he
had
in
his
possession
his
certificate
of
mexican
nationality,
mr.
parsons
said
to
him,
"that's
it,
you
are
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
you
have
committed
an
expatriating
act.
we
have
to
document
your
case.
i
can't
make
that
determination.
"and
when
parsons
was
asked
about
it,
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
"mr.
terrazas
was
surprised
and
mr.
terrazas
did
not
know
that
he
had
expatriated
himself."
how
can
an
act
be
voluntary
if
you
don't
know
what
you
have
done?
and,
again,
getting
to
this
burden
of
proof
issue,
we
still
have
the
situation
that
even
in
the
most
simple
case
if
i
want
to
prove
that
i
have
spoken
before
the
supreme
court,
i
must
still
be
able
to
have
somebody
testify
what
was
done,
when
it
was
done,
where
it
was
done,
who
was
present,
and
in
a
case
like
this,
i
have
to
prove
scienter.
when
dealing
with
something
as
important
as
expatriation,
we
are
entitled
to
know
with
specificity.
the
government
said
we
took
an
oath
of
allegiance.
mexico
does
not
have
an
oath
of
allegiance.
mexico
has
no
oath
whatsoever.
this
is
admitted
by
parsons.
it
is
admitted
by
the
government.
consequently,
we
couldn't
even
take
an
oath.
we
are
accused
of
taking
a
bite
out
of
the
apple,
and
then
in
the
reply
brief
we
are
accused
of
taking
a
bite
out
of
an
orange.
the
two
are
distinct
situations.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
went
to
school
down
there.
many
americans
have
gone
to
school
down
in
mexico.
then
he
went
to
medical
school
down
in
mexico.
in
fact,
it
used
to
be
recommended
that
that
was
a
place
to
get
a
degree.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
it
was
a
document
that
was
signed
in
blank.
it
did
not
contain
the
words
that
my
brother
said
it
did.
it
did
not
contain
the
specific
renunciation
of.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
signed
a
document
which
his
father
sent
--
his
uncle
george
was
a
mexican
official
and
that
blossomed
somehow
into
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
the
document
is
not
rationally
distinguishable
from
the
document
signed
by
mrs.
byrnes
in
the
matheson
case,
which
occurred
essentially
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
mexican
government
issued
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that
evidenced
his
mexican
citizenship,
which
he
had
already.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
in
my
opinion,
that
is
all
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
that
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
he
signed
a
document
blank
and
a
document
with
a
forged
signature
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
mexican
government
did,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
don't
know,
mrs.
byrnes
did.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
certificate
does
say
that,
but
we
do
not
know
how
that
certificate
was
obtained.
no
evidence
was
proven
as
to
how
this
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no,
he
did
not
send
it
back.
he
didn't
even
think
about
it.
he
had
the
document
which
got
him
his
grades
from
school
and
that's
all
he
was
interested
in.
this
was
the
sole
crux
of
what,
in
fact,
he
was
interested
in.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
no.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
yes.
he
went
to
school
down
there.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
proves
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
right,
his
uncle
was
a
mexican
official.
his
mother
lives
here
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
don't
know
where
they
got
the
idea
of
treason.
i
don't
know
where
they
got
the
res
ips
loquitor
approach
to
this
matter.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
declare
that
statute
unconstitutional,
require
voluntariness
and
require
specifically
that
the
government
prove
what
happened,
how
it
happened,
who
was
present
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
believe
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
i
don't
think
it
has
any
relationship
at
all
to
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
the
basic
underlying
statute
does
not
have
to
be
unconstitutional
to
sustain
my
position.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
think
it
does
follow
and
i
think
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
our
--
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
they
are
not
identical,
but
our
court
and
our
state
department
has
said
that
in
order
to
renounce
you've
got
to
do
it
in
a
particular
manner
so
that
that
intent
is
clearly
made
possible.
mr.
kenneth
k.
ditkowsky
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
oath
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
oath
possible.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
once
and
for
all
end
this
case.
it
has
gone
far
enough.
we
have
fought
since
1971
to
the
present
time.
we
are
asking
this
court
at
the
very
least
to
declare
laurence
terrazas
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
