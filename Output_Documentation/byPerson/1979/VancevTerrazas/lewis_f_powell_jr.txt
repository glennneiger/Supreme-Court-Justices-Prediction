similarly,
i
suppose,
if
he
were
in
the
united
states
and
he
were
a
citizen
of
mexico,
and
mexico
had
the
draft,
he
would
be
in
default
in
mexico.
so
his
citizenship
--
his
being
a
mexican
citizen
does
involve
some
obligation,
some
duties
to
the
country?

mr.
ryan,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
affidavit
on
page
38
of
the
appendix?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
don't
you
rely
on
that
as
establishing
an
intention?
he
uses
the
word
"intention"
to
relinquish
united
states
citizenship.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
the
other
statement
also
sworn
to?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
am
i
looking
at
the
same
thing?
exhibit
14
at
page
10a
of
appellant's
appendix.
what
are
you
talking
about
when
you
say
"14a"?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
it
help
us
if
we
don't
have
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
14a?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
was
a
full-fledged
citizen.
i
don't
know
what
a
half-fledged
citizen
is.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
are
things
nobody
can
do
in
mexico
legally.
to
what
are
you
referring?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that's
just
a
matter
of
proof
of
what
was
already
a
fact,
concededly
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
prove
what
was
already
a
fact,
i.e.,
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
mexico,
and
also
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
