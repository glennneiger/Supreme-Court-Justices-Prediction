justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
on
the
expatriating
act
point,
the
document
he
signed
which
you
read
really
kind
of
contains
two
different
thoughts,
one,
that
he
swore
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
mexico,
and
secondly,
that
he
renounced
his
united
states
citizenship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
issues,
as
i
understand
them,
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
the
second
half
of
the
document
had
not
been
in
it.
in
other
words,
it's
the
oath
of
allegiance,
rather
than
the
renunciation,
that
is
legally
significant,
because
it
was
not
before
a
consular
officer,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
in
this
case,
when
he
signed
this
piece
of
paper
down
in
mexico,
he
had
put
a
little
asterisk
and
said,
"p.
s.
i
don't
intend
to
give
up
my
united
states
citizenship"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
they
hadn't
said
anything
to
him,
but
that's
just
the
evidence.
he
says
at
the
bottom,
"i
didn't
intend
i
intended
to
swear
allegiance
to
mexico,
but
i
didn't
intent
to
give
up
my
u.s.
citizenship"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
position
was
that
intent
was
irrelevant,
that
if
he
signs
this
piece
of
paper,
his
intent
is
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
he
put
that
at
the
bottom,
that
p.
s.
at
the
bottom,
you
would
say
it
is
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
always
put
them
in
as
an
appendix
to
your
brief,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
nature
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
application
he
signed
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality,
in
1970?
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
he
applied
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
somebody
issue
him
a
certificate
of
mexican
nationality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
that
certificate
have
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
else
did
it
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
says
that
he
has
expressly
renounced
all
rights
and
adherence
to
other
nationalities.
that's
what
that
certificate
says.
and
so
that
was
an
official
certificate,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
had
applied
for
such
an
official
certificate,
hadn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
he
or
hadn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
the
government
thought
he
had
applied
for
it,
the
mexican
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
application
hadn't
had
in
it
this
renunciation,
he
never
would
have
gotten
the
certificate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
certificate
recites
that
he
has
made
this
renunciation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
these
to
cases
are
the
same,
would
you?
you
go
and
you
apply
for
a
certificate
of
mexican
citizenship.
in
the
one
case,
you
sign
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
"i
swear
allegiance
to
mexico."
say
the
other
fellow
signs
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
"i
swear
allegiance
to
mexico
and
i
renounce
my
allegiance
to
the
united
states."
now,
in
the
second
case,
there
certainly
is
an
intent
that
is
connected
with
swearing
allegiance
to
mexico
that
isn't
present
in
the
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
wouldn't
say
the
two
cases
are
the
same,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
be
relying
on
the
renunciation
as
a
separate
matter,
but
you
would
be
relying
on
a
renunciation
in
order
to
inform
you
as
to
what
the
intent
was
in
connection
with
the
swearing
of
allegiance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
that,
but
why
isn't
the
case
different
if
you've
got
the
two
together,
than
if
you
had
just
the
swearing
of
allegiance?
for
instance,
the
man
swears
his
allegiance
--
assume
in
this
case
he
had
sworn
his
allegiance
and
then
in
parenthesis
he
said,
"and
furthermore,
i
intend
by
this
swearing
of
allegiance
to
give
up
my
citizenship
in
the
united
states,"
close
parenthesis.
and
then
the
question
is
what
did
you
intend
by
your
swearing
of
allegiance?
isn't
that
a
different
case
than
if
he
just
swears
allegiance?
