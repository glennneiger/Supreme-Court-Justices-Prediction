ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants
have
been
making
some
arguments
here
which
sound
like
the
type
of
privacy
arguments
customarily
made
by
individuals.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
we
have
in
this
case.
what
we
have
is
someone
who
is
engaged
in
a
business
operation,
a
business
operation
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
found
has
altered
the
urban
--
suburban
landscape
of
california
in
a
way
that
has
diverted
the
traditional
audiences
that
used
to
assemble
in
parks.
now,
the
court,
as
far
back
as
nebbia,
has
recognized
that
if
one
embarks
in
a
business
which
public
interest
demands
shall
be
regulated,
he
must
know
regulation
will
ensue.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
regulation
in
the
interest
of
promoting
the
public
health,
safety,
welfare
and
morals.
now
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
but
obviously,
there
are
characteristics
of
a
home
which
are
different
from
the
business
operation
which
invites
in
the
general
public
to
--
and
--
and
conducts
operations
on
such
a
scale
that
raise
problems
that
--
that
are
--
can
be
expected
to
bring
about
the
interest
of
--
of
state
regulation.
and
i
would
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
to
some
degree,
hotel
lobbies
are
--
perhaps
don't
issue
quite
the
same
invitation
that
the
--
that
the
owner
of
a
shopping
center
does.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
true.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
true.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
your
honor,
to
--
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
proper
if
this
--
for
the
california
supreme
court
if
they
made
the
kind
of
findings
about
large
hotel
lobbies
of
the
kind
that
you're
talking
about,
that
they
made
about
shopping
centers
to
have
--
and
if
they
found
that
the
state
broad
free
speech
right,
which
is
not
restricted
to
simply
limiting
government
restraints,
could
not
be
effectuated.
otherwise,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
proper
for
this
court
to
reexamine
the
wisdom
of
--
of
that
finding.
but
i
think
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
and
i
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
right.
and
i
think
i
would
like
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
white,
the
united
states
entered
this
case
in
large
part,
because
one
of
the
arguments
--
several
of
the
arguments
that
appellants
were
making
are
so
broad
and
so
extreme
in
their
[laughs]
implications
that
if
they
were
accepted
by
this
court,
they
would
put
in
doubt
constitutionality
of
federal
laws
about
which
i
think
this
court
has
no
doubts.
and
let
me
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
--
i
can
give
you
several,
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
civil
rights
statutes
upheld
and
in
part
of
atlanta
motel.
now,
in
--
in
those
statutes,
the
right
of
a
property
owner,
someone
who
engages
in
--
in
opening
his
public
accommodations
to
the
general
public,
he's
restricted
from
conditioning
access
on
the
grounds
of
the
race
of
the
person
who
desires
access.
the
national
labor
relations
act,
in
some
of
its
applications,
requires
that
under
certain
circumstances,
someone
who
does
not
want
persons
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
but
no
--
but
i
don't
think
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
--
we're
--
we're
talking
here
about
a
state
policy
and
--
and
under
this
court's
decisions,
it
usually
does
not
examine
the
--
the
wisdom
of
--
of
state
policies.
the
state
has
--
the
--
the
highest
supreme
court
--
highest
state
of
california
has
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
--
it
would
be
possible
to
decide
this
case
in
a
way
which
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
but
the
appellants
have
been
suggesting
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
--
that
the
logic
of
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
--
the
appellants
are
making
in
service
of
their
--
of
their
claim
that
the
state
is
prevented
from
making
this
kind
of
limitation
on
--
on
an
owner's
right
to
restrict
access
would
put
him
doubt
the
constitutionality
of
this
federal
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
certainly.
and
the
commerce
power
is
also
tested
under
the
taking
clause
if
--
if
there's
a
complete
destruction
of
the
proper
interest,
which
i
might
say
we
have
nothing
even
approaching
that
here.
but
appellants
stated
in
their
opening
brief
and
i
--
and
although
i
thought
they
had
retreated
in
their
reply
brief,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
still
at
the
core
of
their
argument.
they're
saying,
at
pages
11
to
12
of
their
opening
brief,
“the
right
to
exclude
is
such
a
central
element
of
private
property,
that
the
government
even
in
the
name
of
reasonable
regulation
cannot
diminish
that
right
without
paying
compensation.”
now,
what
that's
saying
is
that
the
state
of
california
is
not
free
to
have
a
broad
free
expression
policy
and
to
effectuate
that
policy,
because
it
might
place
one
restriction
on
the
owner's
right
to
condition
an
invitation
he
has
extended
to
the
general
public.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
--
your
honor,
i
think
the
private
residence
is
a
totally
different
situation.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
business
operation
which
has
extended
a
general
invitation
to
the
public.
in
the
second
place,
there
are
privacy
interests
involved
in
the
private
residence
that
just
are
not
present
here,
any
owner
of
business
property
who's
conducting
an
operation
of
this
kind.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
this
california
supreme
court,
the
owner
--
we're
talking
about
the
minority
enterprises
and
their
role
as
owners
of
a
center
that's
engaged
in
regulation,
that's
engaged
in
operating
a
business
that's
diverted
the
audience.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
believe
that
they
said
time,
place
and
manner
and
i
assume
that
they
mean
time,
place
and
the
manner
in
the
sense
that
that
--
that
those
terms
are
used
in
the
federal
first
amendment
decisions
of
this
court,
which
does
not
include
contented
regulation.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
--
i
think
a
demonstration
might
raise
significantly
different
problems
which
could
be
regulated.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
standing,
but
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
if
they
stood
in
the
corner
and
simply
handed
out
their
leaflets,
probably,
under
--
i
--
i
hate
to
anticipate
the
supreme
court
of
california,
but
i
would
suggest
that
their
use
of
the
phrase
time,
place
and
manner
would
mean
exactly
what
this
court
has
meant
in
the
--
in
the
first
amendment
decisions.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
--
that
shopping
center
owners
might
have
persons
on
their
property
who
would
pass
out
literature
with
views
that
they
--
that
they
disagree
with.
but
they're
certainly
free
to
place
placards
up
saying,
“these
people
don't
represent
our
views.”
no
--
no
one
assumes
that
persons
passing
literature
out
of
the
dallas
airport
represent
views
of
the
dallas
airport
authority.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
unlikely
that
these
views
will
be
attributed
to
the
owner.
i
might
also
add
that
this
court's
decision
in
eastex
would
--
would
--
is
relevant
to
this
point.
it
may
--
it
--
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
owner
of
the
--
of
the
enterprise
in
eastex
did
not
agree
that
the
texas
right
to
work
statute
was
a
bad
idea
or
that
the
federal
minimum
wage
shouldn't
raised
to
$2
an
hour,
but
that
was
not
a
reason
for
saying
that
this
literature
which
is
protected
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
could
not
be
passed
out
by
his
employees
on
his
property.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
under
the
logan
valley
decision,
there
probably
was
boycott
great
picketing
on
supermarket
--
on
shopping
center
property
in
california.
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
within
the
rule.
i
--
as
i
said,
i
think
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
is
--
is
by
reference
to
the
first
amendment
and
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
exceed
that
the
--
there's
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
they
don't.
they
rest
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
i'm
saying
that
the
claims
of
the
owner
against
that
that
nobody
perceived
any
first
amendment
claims
of
--
of
him
against
them.
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
