mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
posed
by
this
appeal
is
a
narrow,
very
simple
issue.
this
arises
on
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
reversed
a
trial
court's
rejection
of
the
request
for
an
injunction
that
the
pruneyard
and
its
owner,
fred
sahadi,
be
enjoined
from
denying
access
to
its
customers.
in
other
words,
the
appellees
here
moved
for
an
injunction
in
the
lower
court
to
enjoin
mr.
sahadi
from
refusing
to
allow
them
to
circulate
petitions
on
his
property.
there
was
a
trial
of
this
request
for
an
injunction.
specific
findings
were
made
by
the
trial
court
as
to
the
existence
of
adequate
available
alternatives
in
that
santa
clara
county.
this
was
coupled
with
the
conclusion
of
law
framed
in
basically,
the
terms
of
lloyd
versus
tanner
to
the
effect
that
other
effective
mean
--
means
of
communication
existed
in
the
community.
the
denial
of
the
injunction
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
when
the
case
reached
the
california
supreme
court,
that
court
reversing
its
prior
holding
and
what
is
adverted
to
in
the
briefs
as
diamond
ii,
asserted
that
the
free
speech
portion
of
the
california
constitution
required
a
reversal
of
the
trial
court
and
the
admission
to
mr.
sahadi's
premises
of
the
persons
who
wished
to
circulate
petitions.
this
court,
as
it
did
in
the
miami
herald
case,
deferred
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
we
would
--
we
have
briefed
pursuant
to
this
rule's
federal
--
this
court's
rule
16,
at
the
outset
of
our
brief,
the
jurisdictional
questions.
it
seems
obvious
that
the
decision
below
upheld
the
validity
of
a
free
speech
portion
of
the
california
constitution
against
a
contention
that
the
construction
sought
of
that
constitutional
provision
denied
mr.
sahadi
and
the
pruneyard
their
rights
under
the
fifth,
fourteenth
and
first
amendments.
we
would
therefore,
submit
that
appeal
is
the
proper
remedy
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
and
not
any
substantial
federal
jurisdiction
and
that
in
the
alternative
as
we
requested
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
if
this
court
should
feel
that
appeal
was
not
the
proper
route,
to
please
accept
certiorari.
i
stated
at
the
outset
that
this
was
a
simple,
narrow
case.
it
does
not
involve
any
attempt
to
regulate
the
content
of
speech.
it
does
not
relate
to
any
ability
on
the
part
of
mr.
sahadi
to
deny
his
shopping
center
customers
the
receipt
of
any
view
which
the
appellees
would
choose
to
put
upon
them.
the
adequate
available
alternatives
finding,
we
think,
is
extremely
important
when
it's
coupled
with
the
finding
that
the
policy
against
solicitation
was
uniformly
and
disinterestedly
--
disinterestedly
applied
by
the
center.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
specific
finding
on
adequate
alternatives
in
santa
clara
county.
the
finding
of
fact
which
was
entered
by
the
trial
court
and
which
was
never
contested
at
the
trial
or
any
appellate
level
was
stated
in
the
following
manner.
the
county
in
which
the
center
is
located
has
many
shopping
centers,
public
shopping
and
business
areas,
public
buildings,
parks,
stadia,
universities,
colleges,
schools,
post
offices
and
similar
public
areas
where
large
numbers
of
people
congregate
and
where
people
can
freely
exercise
first
amendment
rights
including
without
limitation,
distribution
of
handbills
and
seeking
signatures
on
petitions.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
on
the
sidewalks
adjoining
post
offices,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
this
from
the
standpoint
of
language
you
used
in
hudgens,
because
we
read
your
opinion
in
hudgens
as
being
concerned
with
the
availability
of
the
means
for
communicating
ideas.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
did
not.
but
we
think
this
is
a
very
key
finding
of
fact
which
i
say,
was
never
challenged
and
a
conclusion
of
law
which
then
followed
after
the
trial
was
never
challenged
and
that
conclusion
was
that
there
are
adequate
effective
channels
of
communication
for
plaintiffs
other
than
soliciting
on
the
private
property
of
the
center.
the
center
with
capital
c,
and
it
was
defined
to
mean
the
pruneyard
shopping
center
and
its
owner,
mr.
fred
sahadi,
the
alternate,
adequate,
available,
other
places
in
which
to
solicit.
that
is
the
state
of
the
record
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
would
assume
that
there
could
be
a
set
circumstances
or
facts
which
might
permit
you
that
kind
of
attack.
i
cannot
conceive
them
as
i
sit
here
right
now.
i
know
that
agins
versus
tiburon
is
coming
up
on
this
court's
docket,
which
deals
with
the
similar
question
of
whether
after
engaging
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
and
running
out
of
money,
the
city
of
tiburon
could
then
zone
the
land
it
was
prepared
to
condemn.
so,
under
certain
circumstances,
i
think
you
could
make
that
argument,
but
ordinarily
speaking,
the
right
to
zone
would
not
involve
anything
with
respect
to
the
property
right
to
the
extent
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
extent
to
which
the
court
refers
in
virtually
destroying
the
value
of
the
land
as
in
a
condemnation
case.
zoning
is
an
effective
condemnation.
this
court
in
determining
whether
an
interest
which
the
state
has
denominated
a
--
an
interest
in
property
or
the
nonexistence
of
it,
has
historically
applied
federal
standards
to
determine
whether
that
which
was
involved
constituted
property
and
imposing
the
new
legal
disability
on
any
prior
freedom
or
property
invites
federal
examination.
the
situation
here
is,
that
with
respect
to
soliciting
at
shopping
centers,
this
california
supreme
court
in
reliance
on
this
court's
opinion
in
logan
valley
had
held
that
the
shopping
center
could
not
exclude
expressive
activity.
subsequent
to
this
court's
opinion
in
lloyd
versus
tanner,
the
california
supreme
court
reversed
that
position
and
held
that
the
shopping
centers
could,
under
the
federal
principles
articulated
in
lloyd
versus
tanner,
exclude
expressive
activity
of
this
type
on
the
assumption
if,
i
should
say
if,
there
were
adequate
available
opportunities
in
the
community
for
expressive
activity.
it
was
only
in
this
case
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
by
a
4
to
3
majority,
changed
that
rule.
and
in
effect,
deprived
mr.
sahadi
of
what
had
been
regarded
as
a
property
right
up
to
that
time.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
did
that
under
the
california
constitutional
provision.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
it
would
not
necessitate
an
overruling
of
the
precise
holding
in
lloyd.
however,
it
would
necessitate
an
overruling
or
a
refusal
to
apply
the
principles
which
formed
the
underpinning
of
the
lloyd
decision.
the
question
in
lloyd
really
is
whether
the
shopping
center
was
such
a
creature
of
the
state
or
the
equivalent
of
a
municipality
as
to
--
as
to
have
adopted
the
position
of
the
state
for
first
amendment
purposes.
that
is
the
specific
issue
that
was
before
lloyd.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
applies
the
principles
as
articulated
in
lloyd
and
that
is
that
there
are
adequate
available
alternatives.
that
is
part
of
the
analysis
on
the
closeness
of
a
shopping
center
to
the
state.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
sir
and
this
is
a
new
found
california
property
right,
which
is
asserted
against
what
this
court
has
historically
viewed
as
federal
due
process
and
first
amendment
rights.
the
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
the
interests
are
created
by
state
law.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
their
characterization
as
property
for
due
processes
is
determined
by
federal
standards.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
they
do
have
power
to
regulate
property
rights,
but
they
do
not
have
the
power
in
an
unreasonable
manner
and
sub
--
subject
to
the
federal
test
on
what
constitutes
property.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
the
right
to
take
away.
may
i
give
an
example?
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
what
--
basically,
this
court
talked
about
in
lloyd
and
in
hudgens
and
babcock
&
wilcox
and
the
labor
cases
is
what
kind
of
accommodation
must
there
be
between
statutory
matters
such
as
set
forth
in
the
nlra
and
the
interest
of
the
property
owner
or
in
this
case,
the
speaker
or
non-speaker?
and
this
court
in
these
decisions
has
sought
for
an
accommodation
such
that
the
historic
rights
of
property,
the
things
generally
associated
with
property
would
not
be
diluted
except
to
the
extent
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
nlra
industrial
peace.
and
this
court
has
consistently
now,
looked
to
adequate
available
alternatives
before
stating
that
the
union
could
enter
on
to
private
property
either
for
organizational
activity
or
for
picketing
and
protest
of
a
strike.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
i
can
anticipate
the
possibility
of
a
small
state
such
as
rhode
island,
holding
legislative
hearings
and
having
testimony
of
fact
appear
before
it,
and
the
legislature
coming
to
factual
conclusions
in
the
legislative
history,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
absence
of
access
to
shopping
centers,
there
were
no
alternatives
available
opportunities
to
persons
for
expressive
activity.
we
have
the
exact
opportunity
in
this
case.
the
california
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
it
would
only
indicate
that
it
could.
that
would
not
--
i
hasten
to
add,
immunize
it
from
an
attack
by
somebody
who
differed
with
that
conclusion.
but
in
this
case,
california,
an
absolutist,
simplistic
label
of,
“shopping
center”
and
used
statistics
that
indicated
that
shopping
centers
had
increased
greatly.
but
they
were
faced
with
the
finding
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law
below,
as
to
the
existence
of
quantities
of
available
adequate
alternatives.
and
a
conclusion
that
effective
means
of
communication
for
expressive
activity
existed
outside
of
mr.
sahadi's
shopping
center.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
certainly
take
the
same
position.
i
would
analogize
after
wooley
versus
maynard.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
absent
--
some
adequate
basis
which
would
indicate
that
accommodations
of
conflicting
rights
would
require
a
diminution
in
my
free
speech
rights
and
in
my
property
rights,
under
the
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
this
was
raised
before
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
brief.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
sir.
same
that
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
--
we
were
not
required
to
speak
--
that
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
remember
the
finding
in
the
lower
court
that
mr.
sahadi
had
a
uniform
policy
against
any
form
of
non-business
related
expressive
activity.
and
we
asserted
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
not
permit
his
property
to
be
utilized
for
the
expression
of
any
ideas.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
under
this
opinion,
each
shopping
center
is
directed
to
be
a
municipality
and
pick
out
reasonable
time,
places
and
manners.
and
i
assume
if
it
was
a
shopping
center
that
was
sufficiently
profitable
so
that
it
could
employ
lawyers,
the
lawyers
could
come
up
with
a
set
of
such
standards,
which
would
permit
it
to
limit
the
number
at
any
given
time
or
any
place.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
what
the
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
what
the
california
supreme
court
has
done
is
make
every
shopping
center,
however
labeled,
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
municipality.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir,
the
same
way
that
the
one
in
municipalities
got.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
i
would
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
implicit
in
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
is
no
control
over
content
at
all.
also
implicit,
is
no
right
to
remain
silent
even
if
there
are
adequate
alternatives
available.
it's
our
contention
your
honors
that
under
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court,
the
supremacy
clause
stops
at
the
california
border
and
we
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
that
opinion.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i'd
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
--
on
the
areas
of
the
shopping
center
is
constituted
private
property,
subject
to
reasonable
regulations
as
to
time,
place
and
manner.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no
indication,
sir.
under
the
reasoning
of
the
california
supreme
court,
if
i
were
to
hold
a
garage
sale
in
my
residence
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
i
am
not
certain,
because
it
is
not
clear,
but
if
i
were
to
hold
a
garage
sale
and
open
it
to
the
public,
there
is
no
way
as
i
view
this,
the
logic
of
this
opinion
that
i
could
keep
out
a
saffron
robe,
bookseller.
it's
part
of
the
hare
krishna
religion
to
sell
books.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
as
the
california
supreme
court
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
said
shopping
centers
and
they
quoted
in
their
opinion
judge
newman
the
portion
of
judge
mosk's
prior
dissent
in
diamond
ii,
in
which
he
stated,
this
is
not
to
say
that
these
rules
would
apply
to
modest
retail
establishments
or
private
homes.
that's
the
only
indication
we
have,
but
if
i
have
a
garage
sale
at
my
private
home,
by
the
logic
in
the
california
supreme
court,
i
have
invited
people
on
to
my
property
to
purchase.
and
i
don't
know
what
a
modest
retail
establishment
is.
i
--
when
i'm
in
los
angeles,
worked
in
the
bank
of
america
tower,
perhaps,
the
bank
of
america
would
be
regarded
as
an
immodest
commercial
establishment
because
there
are
three
floors
of
stores
in
there.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
except
for
the
fact
that
on
the
logic
of
the
supreme
court,
if
you
are
conducting
a
business,
you
must
permit
expressive
activity
as
i
read
it.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
because
there
is
no
definition
of
a
shopping
center.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
sir?
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
if
he
invites
the
public,
i
would
have
to
assume
that
it
would.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'd
--
if
--
if
absent
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
if
i
could
go
before
a
court
and
establish
as
a
fact
in
an
adversary
proceeding,
that
20
acres
was
an
unreasonable
limitation,
because
with
respect
to
my
property,
there
were
adequate
available
alternatives,
i
would
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
its
application
to
me
because
i
would
think
that
in
that
case,
there
was
no
interest.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
that's
one
interesting
aspect
to
the
california
supreme
court
opinion.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
because
under
this
opinion,
now,
union
picketing
would
be
allowed
which
would
not
be
permitted
under
national
labor
relations
act
and
you're
going
to
have
an
interesting
preemption
question
that
you
will
have
to
face
in
the
future
assuming
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
stands.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
ended
up
reserving
as
much
time
as
i'd
like
to
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
diamond
ii
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
case
overruled
diamond
ii,
which
came
down
after
tanner.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
not
in
the
record.
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
your
question
in
this
regard,
because
we're
intimately
involved
in
the
(inaudible)
which
is
an
initiative
process
related
to
putting
a
surtax
on
oil
companies
who
were
above
at
certain
size.
this
decision
has
spawned
a
variety
of
things,
some
of
which
are
public
records
such
as
opposed
member
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
the
hare
krishna,
part
of
whose
religion
is
selling
books.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
rhode
island
has
a
statute
before
its
legislature
now
which
would
prohibit
any
business
from
excluding
any
politician
who
is
running
for
office
or
wants
to
run
from
office
as
an
example,
any
business.
wisconsin
has
a
proposed
statute
on
its
books.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
no,
just
a
business.
if
you
have
a
business,
which
is
open
to
the
public,
you
cannot
exclude
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
--
any
politician
who
wants
to
come
in
and
campaign.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
can
give
the
court
the
cite
to
that,
if
you'd
like.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
it
has
not
been
enacted.
one
state
has
enacted.
it
was
referred
to
in
the
homart,
friend
of
the
court
brief.
this
decision
has
wide
ramifications
that
this
court
makes
as
a
result
of
these
arguments.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
oregon
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
oregon
court
was
faced
with
the
precise
same
issue
as
the
california
supreme
court
and
upheld
the
principle
--
we
would
call
the
principles
and
the
reasoning
of
lloyd
versus
tanner.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
as
near
as
i
can
determine,
it
was
a
property-based
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
this,
as
i
said,
we
raised
in
the
california
supreme
court,
both
before
argument
and
in
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
they
did
not
address
the
issue,
but
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
sir,
i
would
like
not
to
designate
either
of
my
grounds
as
principals
i
think
they
are
both
very
significant
and
of
equal
importance.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
supported
by
lloyd
versus
tanner.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
accommodation
between
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
i
--
it
gave
them
--
it's
--
it
was
--
its
reasoning
is
based
on
the
fact
that
in
first
amendment
situations,
the
rights
to
expressive
activity
are
weighed
against
the
rights
of
the
property
owner
to
make
sure
that
no
greater
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
but,
mr.
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell
made
the
point
in
that
case.
that
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
all
right.
i
mean,
in
his
opinion
and
the
court
made
it
as
it
has
made
it
in
babcock
&
wilcox
and
others,
that
where
you
are
advancing
a
particular
right
whether
in
a
commerce
clause
or
otherwise,
to
the
extent
that
it
interferes
with
what
are
thought
to
be
property
or
speech
rights,
the
court
goes
through
a
balancing
to
see
that
it
does
not
interfere
unreasonably
with
it.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
yes,
sir.
to
the
extent
that
that
made
a
moving
billboard
out
of
that
specific
state
motto,
the
california
supreme
court
would
make
a
permanent
billboard
out
of
every
shopping
center
for
any
idea.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
it
also
adopted
the
principles
which
you've
used
in
your
nlra
cases
with
respect
to
reasonable,
available,
adequate
alternatives.
i
would
like
to
close
with
just
one
point,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
max
l.
gillam,
jr.
they
are
a
captive
audience
only
to
the
extent
that
they
go
to
shopping
centers
which
are
deemed
desirable
by
the
person
engaged
in
--
in
particular
form
of
expressive
activity.
if
i
have
a
center
that
is
attractive
and
draws
large
number
of
people,
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
extensive,
expressive
activity
on
that
shopping
center
may
drive
away
business.
however,
it's
a
free
choice
as
it
sits
now
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there
were
stipulations
with
respect
to
the
nine
largest
shopping
centers
in
santa
clara
county,
appears
on
page
6
and
7
of
the
record.
the
first
item
of
business
was
a
stipulation
that
out
of
the
largest
nine
shopping
centers
in
santa
clara
county,
one
was
forbidden
by
local
ordinance
from
permitting
the
expressive
activity,
four
permitted
it,
four
did
not.
the
stipulation
went
on
that
the
plaintiffs
had
conducted
a
survey
of
santa
clara
county.
some
centers
permitted
expressive
activity,
some
did
not,
some
of
those
who
did
permit
it,
did
it
subject
to
reasonable
regulation.
it's
in
the
face
of
that
that
the
california
supreme
court's
assumption
is
so
egregious,
implicit,
in
that
opinion
is
the
assumption
that
expressive
activity
is
barred
from
all
shopping
centers.
that's
why
that
fact
is
so
significant
which
we
contend
makes
this
a
very
narrow
case,
the
existence
at
great
length
of
the
adequate
available
alternative.
thank
you.
