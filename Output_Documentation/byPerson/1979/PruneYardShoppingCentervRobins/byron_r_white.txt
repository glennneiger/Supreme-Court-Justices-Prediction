and
if
the
--
and
if
the
center
isn't
they
--
an
arm
of
the
state,
why,
no
matter
how
many
free
speech
rights
an
individual
has,
he
hasn't
got
them
against

justice

well,
suppose
--
suppose
the
man
owns
a
shopping
center
or
a
grocery
store
or
something
and
there
are
no
relevant
statutes
at
all
and
someone
comes
in
and
wants
to
pass
out
leaflets.
he
says,
“get
off
of
my
property”
and
he
can
throw
him
off,
even
the
fellow
says
“i've
got
--
just
think
of
my
speech
rights”
and
he
says,
“tell
it
to
the
state.”
it
protects
you
against
state
interference,
“don't
interfere,
you
just
get
out
of
my
place.”
what
is
that
--
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
--
if
there
is
a
statute
passed
by
the
state
that
says
that
all
owners
of
shopping
centers
will
--
must
let
on
to
their
property,
people
who
want
to
picket
their
lessees.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
of
--
of
--
the
state
has
some
--
some
power
to
regulate
property
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
forget
that.
in
my
example
there
is
no
federal
interest,
yet
whatsoever.
there's
just
a
state
law
that
says
that
--
that
picketers
come
on
your
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you're
just
--
so
you're
just
saying
that
whether
the
state
had
a
--
a
statute
like
i
just
suggested
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
--
for
a
failure
to
be
more
--
be
more
precise.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
stating
that
we're
taking
the
same
approach,
if
there
is
a
state
statute
which
says
that
at
christmas
time,
the
salvation
army
and
other
charitable
organizations
may
--
may
setup
little
stands
to
raise
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
shopping
centers?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
state
is
--
that
the
state
has
disentitled
under
its
--
its
many
powers
to
limit
your
property
rights
to
that
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
are
--
are
you
relying
in
this
case
on
--
on
the
right
--
on
the
--
on
the
free
speech
rights
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
need
to
provide
us
to
have
a
forum
for
views
with
which
you
don't
agree
with

with
which
you
don't
agree?
justice

no,
sir
or
yes,
sir.
justice
byron

white
but
they
had
--
but
i
suppose
some
content
differentiation
wouldn't
be
reasonable.
if
he
said,
“well,
there
are
some
people
i
had
in
my

with
some
people,
i
just
had

where
did
the

where
did
the
supreme
court
say
this
activity
could
take
place?
in
the
public
areas
on
the
--
justice

white
--
in
the
mall?
justice
byron

white
what
about
in
--
what
about
in
the
stores,
it
didn't
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
stores,
you
can
go
into
the
stores
and
handout
leaflets?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
been
an
owner
--
he's
just
suggesting
the
owner
objects
to
presenting
a
forum
or
a
pedestal
for
views
that
he'd
--
doesn't
necessarily
agree
with
or
for
any
views.
isn't
that
a
perfectly
legitimate
claim
by
the
property
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
most
property
owners,
if
you're
not
talking
about
shopping
centers,
you're
talking
about
your
front
yard,
somebody
comes
along,
wants
to
make
a
speech
in
your
front
yard.
you
say,
“well,
what
are
you
going
to
say?”
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
say
so
and
so.”
i
say,
“great,
come
on.
let's
have
a
big
speech
right
here
in
my
front
yard,
we'll
get
a
crowd.”
next
guy
comes
along
and
says
“i'd
like
to
speak
in
your
front
yard,
what
are
you
going
to
say?”
he
tells
me
--
as
a
--
“awfully,
sorry,
i
am
not
least
interested
in
that
and
just
stay
offs
my
property.”
that's
what
most
property
owners
can
do,
i'd
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
it
–
can't
this
man
--
why
can't
this
man
do
it,
when
he
says,
“i
don't
want
anybody
coming
onto
my
property
to
say
anything?”
justice
byron
r.
white
by
a
degree
you
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
that
there
--
that
it's
just
now
a
property
right
question.
it
--
it
just
isn't
that
california
may
limit
the
--
may
define
property
rights
and
say,
“look,
all
private
property
owner
in
this
state
are
subject
to
some
limitations.”
and
one
of
the
limitations
is
that
leaflets
maybe
passed
out
on
any
privately
owned
property
in
the
state.
what
if
the
legislature
just
passed
that
and
say,
“and
under
california
law
then
property
--
the
owner
of
property
just
doesn't
have
the
right
to
keep
people
off
for
that
purpose,
but
there
would
be
another
interest
involved
wouldn't
there,
in
the
property
owner?
his

his
first
amendment

what
about
the

the
j.c.

in
that
shopping
center,
is
he
--
he's
subject
to
the
same
rule,
isn't
he?
justice

but
it
--
under

under
your
approach,
it
would
be

it
would
take
you
right
into

wouldn't
it?

take
it,
you're

way,
it

hasn't
have
any
weighing

the

mr.

you

somebody
want
to

on
my

at
home
and
make
a

i
have

i
--
i
was

an
ordinary

keeping

off
