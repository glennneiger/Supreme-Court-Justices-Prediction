justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gillam,
i
don't
really
read
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
quite
as
broadly
as
that.
this
case
involves
a
21-acre
shopping
center.
and
i
just
want
to
ask
you,
i
--
is
it
your
position
that
if
there
were
a
california
statute
or
a
california
zoning
regulation
that
said,
“in
all
shopping
centers
of
over
20
acres,
there
must
be
allowed
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
--
for
picketing
or
--
or
leafleting,”
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
don't
make
any
findings
about
adequate
alternatives
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that
would
be
on
its
face,
an
--
an
unjustified
interference
of
property
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
same
thing
about
a
statute
that
said
that
union
picketing
is
--
is
--
shall
be
permitted
in
shopping
centers
of
over
this
size?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
