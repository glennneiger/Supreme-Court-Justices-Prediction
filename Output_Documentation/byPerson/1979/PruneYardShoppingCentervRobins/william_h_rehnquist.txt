justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gillam,
can't
--
couldn't
you
equally
well
attack
a
zoning
ordinance
by
saying
that
there
are
other
places
you
could
build
this
same
kind
of
factory
and
therefore,
the
state's
prohibition
of
your
building
adhered
--
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
--
isn't
it
basically
the
old
mahon
versus
pennsylvania
coal
case
that
the
state
can
limit
the
use
of
private
property
or
place
certain
restriction
on
up
to
a
point,
but
if
it
virtually
destroys
its
use
or
comes
close
to
significantly
destroying
its
use,
then
it
has
to
--
it
has
to
pay
just
compensation
and
it's
kind
of
a
hard
line
to
draw?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
--
in
lloyd
and
hudgens,
the
people
who
wanted
to
distribute
leaflets
were
coming
here
simply
claiming
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
gave
them
that
right.
here,
they're
coming
here
saying
that
the
california
property
law
gives
them
that
right.
they
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
federal
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
--
would
that
rhode
island
conclusion
means
that
the
rhode
island
legislature
was
mandated
to
put
a
limitation
on
property
rights
or
only
that
it
could?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
right
to
privacy
is
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
majority
is
trying
to
get
--
get
a
--
try
to
--
trying
to
in
--
in
effect,
minimize
by
this
regulation
because
to
--
to
take
a
finding
that
the
bel
air
area
in
los
angeles,
which
--
the
only
way
to
reach
bel
air
residence
is
by
leafleting
on
their
property
since
they
all
have
five
acre
estates
and
they
never
leave
them
except
in
mercedes
benz
cars.
[laughter]
the
--
the
--
that
would
be
in
a
sense,
an
attack
on
their
right
of
privacy
and
yet,
it
would
open
up
the
channels
of
the
first
amendment
communication.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
--
you're
here
for
the
government,
ms.
stillman,
i
take
it,
not
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
for
the
federal
government
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
which
doesn't
create
property
rights
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps,
the
government
--
perhaps
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
but
the
first
amendment
certainly
restricts
the
commerce
power.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
could
say
there,
live
free
or
die
case,
that
new
hampshire
license
