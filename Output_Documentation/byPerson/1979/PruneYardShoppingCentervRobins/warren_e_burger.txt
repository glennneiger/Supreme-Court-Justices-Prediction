we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
pruneyard
shopping
center
against
robins.
mr.
gillam,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
this
opinion
as
it
stands
now,
of
the
california
supreme
court,
if
25
different
groups
wanted
to
handout
leaflets
or
get
petitions
signed
on
the
same
saturday,
could
they
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sort
of
a
licensing
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
like
a
permit
for
a
parade?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
confined
in
your
view
to
petitions
to
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
if
--
what
if
on
its
face,
it
was
a
petition
to
the
government,
but
in
fact
that
that
was
spurious
that
it
really
was
just
a
propaganda
measure
of
--
in
favor
of
the
plo,
let
us
say,
or
the
irish
republican
army.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
think
that
california
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
you
think
that
california
under
our
system
has
anything
to
do
with
race
--
in
relations
with
the
plo
or
the
ira?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
a
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
is
related
to
your
tradition
of
public
referenda
on
many,
many
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
on
content
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
shopping
center
was
owned
by
a
church
organization?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
say
the
archdiocese
of
san
francisco,
if
--
if
that
is
an
archdiocese
and
the
petitions
are
petitions
that
are
pro-abortion
or
some
other
issue
which
is
directly
in
conflict
with
the
philosophy
and
dogma
of
the
owner,
any
--
any
--
what's
the
situation
under
the
california
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
same
--
i
suppose
it's
the
same
kind
of
a
conflict
on
content
might
arise,
if
for
example,
an
international
union
owned
a
21-acre
shopping
center,
which
it
might
as
a
matter
of
investment.
and
what
--
were
--
could
you
say
to
them
about
the
--
the
right
to
work,
petitions
for
the
right
to
work,
which
are
certainly
in
conflict
with
organized
labor's
views?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
they
allow
them
or
not
under
this
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
right
to
privacy
flows
from
the
first
amendment.
haven't
we
suggested
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
anyone
can
legally
define
a
shopping
center
and
know
precisely
what
it
is.
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
now
areas
in
shopping
centers,
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
as
much
as
a
city
per
square
block
of
open
areas
surrounded
by
shops,
but
covered
over
entirely.
now,
is
that
common
area
open
to
this
kind
of
picketing
under
the
california
decision
--
this
kind
of
leafleting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
the
california
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
a
variation
of
that
would
be
some
of
the
modern
hotel
lobbies,
which
are
huge
lobbies
again
surrounded
by
15,
20,
25
stores
on
the
ground
floor,
accessible
from
the
lobby
of
the
hotel,
also
accessible
from
the
street.
leafleting
in
that
lobby
of
the
hotel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
what
i've
just
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
like
to
view
the
functionally
equivalent
of
a
shopping
center.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
stillman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
much
regulation
--
are
you
speaking
of
regulation
in
the
sense
of
utilities,
railroads,
airlines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
in
that
sense,
you
--
every
--
every
man's
home
is
regulated,
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
from
my
part
--
from
my
part,
ms.
stillman,
i'm
--
i'm
interested
and
i
know
that
no
one
can
tell
us
the
whole
scope
of
this
opinion,
but
i'm
interested
in
specific
points.
you
heard
in
my
question
to
your
colleague
about
the
large
hotel
lobby,
maybe
twice
as
big
as
--
three
times
as
big
as
this
room,
surrounded
by
25,
30,
35
stores.
is
--
they
invite
the
public
very
anxiously,
they're
anxious
to
have
them.
now,
does
this
--
may
they
pass
out
leaflets
in
the
lobby
of
that
hotel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
they
--
do
they
have
access
doors
going
from
the
lobby
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
into
the
shop.
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
some
kind
of
an
invitation
for
people
in
the
lobbies
who
go
into
the
shop
and
hotels
do
not
limit
access
to
the
lobby
to
guests
at
the
hotel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
in
the
private
residence
of
the
five-acre
type
that
someone
mentioned
this
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
state
of
california
limit
the
owner's
right
to
exclude
the
public
from
that
five
acres
or
10
or
100?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wonder
what
your
answer
would
be
to
the
--
some
of
the
hypotheticals
i
put
to
mr.
hammer
this
morning.
for
example,
we
have
now
the
new
phenomenon
of
minority
business
enterprises.
and
suppose
you
have
a
minority
business
enterprise
or
corporation
made
up
of
american
indians,
eskimos,
negroes,
mexican-americans
that
cross
the
border
and
all
minority
groups,
and
they
own
the
--
the
shopping
centers,
this
shopping
center,
must
they
allow
the
ku
klux
klan
to
come
on
or
the
american
nazi
party
passing
out
leaflets
for
the
master
race
and
for
the
--
anything
that
the
klan
and
the
american
nazis
believe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
content
--
content
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
content
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
if
the
nazi
party
wanted
to
put
a
demonstration
in
such
that
they
had
done
in
illinois
a
couple
of
years
ago
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
say
a
very
orderly
demonstration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nazis
are
very
disciplined
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
five
minutes
remaining,
mr.
gillam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nobody
has
mentioned
the
captive
audience
aspect
so
far
as
i
recall
anywhere
here.
people
going
to
a
supermarket
or
going
out
to
by
groceries
and
meat
and
whatnot,
are
they,
in
your
view,
something
of
a
captive
audience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
gilliam.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
and
we'll
hear
arguments
