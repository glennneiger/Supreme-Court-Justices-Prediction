justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
law
of
california
imposed
a
restriction
of
--
upon
the
householders,
upon
the
property
right
of
householders?
it
said
to
you,
“anybody
can
come
on
anybody's
front
yard
and
picket
the
way
they
did
here,
with
shopping
centers.”
would
that
present
any
question
or
problem
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
does,
why
doesn't
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
the
california
court,
had
done
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
the
front
yards
of
householders.
so
you
can't
rely
about
what
the
california
court
did.
i'm
assuming
in
both
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
your
court
did
precisely
what
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
did
in
this
case
and
what
it
did
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
if
they
were
finding
that
specifically
involves
the
front
yards
of
householders?
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
that
--
if
--
if
that
presents
a
constitutional
question,
why
doesn't
this,
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
defends
to
your
brother
and
--
and
his
client.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
of
a
hypothetical
case
that
all
of
that
was
(inaudible)
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
that
but
--
but
that
the
factual
context
of
the
case
were
not
a
shopping
center,
but
rather
somebody's
front
yard.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
it
has
to
offend
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
--
would
that
be
a
taking
without
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
california
found
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
householders
own
free
speech
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
be
in
california
after
--
after
that
decision,
until
it
is
reversed
by
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
now,
after
this
disposition
of
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
if
--
not
if
the
state
supreme
court
had
held
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
he's
simple
--
if
he's
simple
in
our
state,
means
it's
qualified
by
your
obligation
to
let
anybody
come
on
your
lawn
and
make
a
speech.
