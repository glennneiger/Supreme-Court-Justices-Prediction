mr.
philip
l.
hammer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
california
supreme
court
has
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
state
constitution
protects
the
right
of
individuals
to
solicit
signatures
on
a
petition
to
their
government
on
the
premises
of
a
privately
owned
shopping
center.
we
contend
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
state
of
california
from
so
regulating
the
use
of
private
property
within
its
borders
since
the
california
supreme
court
specifically
found
that
the
public
welfare
would
be
substantially
impaired,
if
that
right
were
denied.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
the
--
the
reference
by
the
california
supreme
court
was
to
article
1
section
3,
which
is
our
state
constitutional
right
of
petition
to
our
government,
yes,
sir.
that's
if
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
i
don't
know
whether
such
petitions
would
on
their
face
be
spurious
but
a
--
the
right
of
california
citizens
to
petition
their
government,
which
consists
of
government
at
many
levels,
is
a
--
a
very
vital
right
in
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
--
petitioning
in
this
case
was
to
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
--
the
state
government
may
not,
although
the
state
government
may
declare
itself
on
international
issues,
the
petitions
in
this
case
where
addressed
to
the
national
government,
to
the
--
to
president
ford
and
to
congress.
we
are
seeking
to
uphold
the
right
to
petition
in
california.
our
--
our
supreme
court's
decision
stresses
the
very
vital
nature
of
that
right
in
the
california
scheme
of
things.
in
our
state,
perhaps
different
--
from
other
places,
the
citizen
uses
the
petition
for
direct
access
to
the
process
of
self-government.
in
recent
times,
the
people
have
seen
fit
to
restructure
the
property
tax
base
for
financing
local
government,
have
adopted
a
protective
mechanism
for
our
coastline
and
have
enacted
far-reaching
campaign
reforms,
just
to
mention
a
few.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes,
sir.
that's
in
--
in
california,
referenda,
initiatives,
recall
and
simply
the
broad
right
to
--
to
petition
government
is
--
is
a
part
of
our
life.
the
--
the
supreme
court
determined
that
the
right
of
petition
is
threatened,
if
it
is
not
accessible
in
the
common
areas
of
shopping
centers.
here
also,
the
decision
of
our
highest
court
goes
to
great
pains
to
describe
how
vital
that
access
is.
shopping
centers
dominate
retail
commerce
in
our
state.
and
particularly,
the
community
in
which
this
case
arose.
the
traditional
forums
for
public
discussion,
the
public
streets,
town
squares,
public
parks
and
the
like
are
dead
or
fast
dying.
as
the
california
court
found,
central
business
districts
of
municipalities
have
yielded
their
functions
to
suburban
shopping
centers.
having
caused
the
demise
of
the
traditional
forum
in
california
and
reasonable
access
to
a
forum
having
been
found
essential
to
the
public
welfare,
shopping
centers
in
california
are
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
subject
to
a
rule
of
law
prohibiting
them
from
denying
the
right
to
circulate
a
petition,
subject
of
course,
to
the
reasonable
restrictions
as
to
time,
place
and
manner.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
nothing
on
content,
sir.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
sir
--
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
a
--
a
different
situation,
but
it
is
one
that
the
california
supreme
--
it
might
raise
a
conflict
between
two
rights
that
are
not
present
in
this
case
and
the
california
supreme
court
or
the
state
court
system
would
be
well
equipped
under
its
constitution
and
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
resolve
what
might
be
a
conflict
of
rights,
if
the
center
were
well
known
as
being
a
place
owned
by
a
religious
body.
in
this,
in
the
situation
that
the
court
is
reviewing
here
of
course,
there
is
no
such
identification
of
the
penury.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
no
matter
who
owns
the
shopping
center,
the
rule
applies
within
california.
i'd
pointed
to
the
religious
ownership
problem
as
one
that
might
raise
other
constitutional
issues,
but
i
think
implicit
in
what
the
appellant
is
trying
to
argue
with
respect
to
its
first
amendment
rights,
is
that
somehow,
the
--
a
shopping
center
is
in
the
communications
business
as
to
ideas.
and
that
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
the
--
the
property
owner
may
object
to
the
--
to
the
regulation
that's
now
applicable
in
california
as
a
result
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes.
most
property
owners
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
because
the
law
in
california
now,
imposes
a
regulation,
a
restriction
of
what
--
what
might
otherwise
have
been
as
arbitrary
power,
based
upon
the
role
he
plays
that
particular
owner
of
that
particular
kind
of
property
in
our
society
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
in
my
mind,
sir,
that
might
well
present
due
process
problems.
that
there
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
because
the
california
court
which
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
in
this
case,
sir,
we
are
faced
with
a
finding
a
--
about
a
situation
in
california
that
specifically
involved
shopping
centers
and
not
houses.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
i
think
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
the
--
that
would
--
a
--
a
rule
that
it
--
that
applied
to
individual
householders
would
offend
i
suppose
decent
standards
of
fairness
and
decency
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
the
--
i
guess,
i
am
--
i
am
saying
as
to
the
regulation
here
which
was
geared
to
the
public
welfare
of
the
people
of
california
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes
sir.
i
would
assume
this
court
would
as
it
does
with
state's
efforts
to
deal
with
local
problems,
assume
the
legislative
enactment
or
the
regulation
to
be
a
valid
one,
if
it
offended
the
--
the
court's
basic
sense
of
--
of
justice
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
but
the
--
the
due
process
clause
as
applied
to
economic
regulation
in
this
court's
application
of
that
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
it
again
falls
back
upon
the
--
the
basis
of
the
regulation.
is
it
a
reasonable
regulation
based
upon
the
public
welfare?
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
okay.
and
if
california
found
that
such
a
regulation
applicable
to
an
individual
household
was
related
to
a
public
--
to
the
public
welfare,
health,
safety
and
morals,
then,
i
would
--
i
would
think
the
assumption
would
be
that
it
would
not
be
a
taking,
but
the
--
there
are
other
inquiries
in
connection
with
the
takings
clause.
and
that
would
--
has
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
the
--
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
homeowner,
would
be
that
the
front
yard
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
but
the
reasonable
expectations
of
a
shopping
center
owner
are
very
different
from
the
--
those
of
the
homeowner.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
but
were
for
years,
before
diamond
ii,
the
--
the
shopping
center
owner
as
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
briefs,
pre1974,
pre-diamond
ii,
shopping
centers
have
been
subject
to
this
kind
of
rule
of
law
for
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
--
a
decade,
sir.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
there
would
be
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
this
matter
of
private
residences,
obviously,
there
are
many
interests
of
individuals
involved
in
that
kind
of
situation
that
are
not
present
here,
the
right
to
privacy,
the
very
notion
of
having
a
private
home.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
and
--
and
the
first
amendment
right,
but
to
be
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
justice
rehnquist,
the
--
when
business
is
regulated
by
government,
private
decisions
that
theretofore
have
been
that
of
the
proprietor
are
in
a
sense
removed.
that
is
what
has
occurred
as
a
result
of
this
rule
of
law.
a
--
what
otherwise
had
been
discretionary
to
the
property
owner,
the
right
to
exclude
and
control
the
kind
of
communication
on
this
particular
kind
of
property,
is
now
subject
to
a
regulation
if
it's
a
shopping
center.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
no,
sir.
the
--
the
rule
applies
to
the
common
areas
of
shopping
centers.
the
shopping
center
owner
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
well,
first
of
all,
it's
not
a
question
of
where
would
i
stop
and
it
would
be
what
the
--
where
would
the
california
court
stop
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
--
but
what
they
have
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
my
principle
applies
to
the
common
areas
of
shopping
centers.
this
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
because
the
common
area
of
shopping
centers
is
what
has
been
found
to
have
replaced
the
public
forum.
this
is
the
place
where
without
the
requirement
of
--
of
buying
anything
--
doing
any
commerce,
the
public
is
invited.
shopping
centers
in
our
area
send
out
flyers,
advertise
fashion
shows,
band
concerts,
a
whole
variety
of
activities
in
the
common
area,
where
people
are
just
urged
to
come
and
be
--
and
while
they
are
there,
it
is
hoped
by
the
center
owner
that
they
will
shop,
but
common
areas
of
shopping
centers
are
a
phenomenon
all
through
themselves
in
california.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
if
i
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
if
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
simply
the
covering
of
the
common
area,
would
that
make
a
distinction?
i
think
no.
it
is
still
the
common
area
in
which
commerce
does
not
take
place,
but
where
people
congregate
because
of
the
beauty
of
the
place,
because
it
is
part
of
the
attractiveness
of
the
center.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
it
is
the
phenomenon
of
the
shopping
center
that
the
california
court
found
has
replaced
the
traditional
forum.
it
is
not
the
lobbies
of
the
hotel.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
and
i
--
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
because
it
is
--
well,
i
--
i
suppose
under
certain
fact
situations,
if
i
know
some
of
our
hotels
where
there
are
a
circle
of
retail
stores
and
so
--
that
do
surround
the
lobby,
it
might
be
a
factual
matter
for
the
state
court
to
weigh
whether
that
falls
within
the
ambit
of
robins
versus
the
pruneyard,
as
the
case
is
known
in
california.
but
clearly,
the
--
the
decision
is
related
to
shopping
centers
and
not
hotels,
but
i
think
the
state
court
could
deal
with
that.
the
â€“
the
situate
--
the
scene
in
california
is
really
quite
different
as
compared
to
this
beautiful
city.
the
--
that
people
in
--
in
many
of
our
areas
of
california
are
rarely
found
on
--
on
public
property.
they're
in
their
homes
and
workplaces,
they're
in
their
automobiles
and
they're
at
privately-owned
shopping
centers.
they
are
rarely
on
the
public
streets
and
the
ruling
in
this
case
is
really
responsive
to
that
local
situation.
mr.
philip
l.
hammer
thank
you.
