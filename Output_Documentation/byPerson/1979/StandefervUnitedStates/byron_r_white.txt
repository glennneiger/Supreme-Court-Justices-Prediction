it

the
jury

to

didn't
it?
in

it

it
found
that
he
committed
an
illegal
act
and
that
in
certain
respects
your
client
aided
and
abetted.
and
it
is
true
that
in
another
case
the
principal
was
found
innocent
but
in
this
case
the
principal
was
found
guilty.
justice
byron

that
is
correct.
justice

this
obviously
is
a
different
argument
than
whether
or
not
you
can
convict
one
as
an
aider
and
abettor
if
the
principal
has
been
acquitted.
justice
byron
r.

how
about
the
--
are
you
through
arguing
that?
justice
byron

the
government
should
not
have
more
than
one
chance
to
prove
the
principal
guilty
if
he
has
been

innocent,
that
is
the
end

it?

aider
and
abettor
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
of
course
would
be
far
broader
than
aiders
and
abettors.
suppose
the
statute
said
it
shall
be
illegal
to
give
or
receive
a
gratuity
for
performing
a
governmental
act.
and
so
you
indict
under
that
statute
a
government
servant
and
he
is
acquitted.
and
then
you
indict
the
person
that
was
accused
of
giving
him
a
gratuity
and
not
as
an
aider
and
abettor
but
as
a
principal.
and
then
you
would
say
that
is
barred.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
if
we
affirm
that
it
necessarily
means
that
a
jury
could
come
out
with
different
results
in
the
same
trial
between
the
principal
and
the
aider
and
abettor,
they
could
acquit
the
principal
and
convict
the
aider
and
abettor?
justice

i
am
puzzled.
why
isn't
that
perfectly
permissible
under
the
dunn
case?

what

you

justice

didn't

and
it

just
a
question
of
inconsistent
verdicts
between

justice

it
didn't

two

justice

have
you

well,
you

but
the

has
never
extended
the
reasoning
of

to
successive
trials,
to
two
different
juries.
justice
byron

that
is
right.
so
that
the
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
issue
is
a
brand
new
question
this
court
has
never
really
addressed
in
the
criminal
context?
justice
byron

white
and
one
of
the
questions
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
reasoning
that
applies
in
the
civil
context,
and
i
assume
you
agree
that
there
would
be
a
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
here
if
it
were
a
civil
case,
does
that
reasoning
apply
to
a
criminal
