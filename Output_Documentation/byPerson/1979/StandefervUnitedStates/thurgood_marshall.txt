i
said
that
there
are
two
different
congresses.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can
say
that
the
original
jury
all
it
did
was
acquit
the
man.
it
didn't
say
the
crime
wasn't
committed,
did
it?
did
it
say
the
crime
wasn't
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
it
said
was
acquitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
say
this
man
is
not
guilty,
they
just
thought
that
he
wasn't
properly
identified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
he
could
have
been
in
china
when
it
was
committed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
what
constitutional
rule
can
you
say
this
young
man
cannot
be
tried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
possible
that
he
did
receive
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wasn't
it
presented
to
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
presented
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
same
evidence
used
in
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
worries
me
is
that
you
are
asking
us
to
take
into
our
consideration
the
possibility
that
a
jury
might
"exercise
compassion"
and
turn
a
man
loose.
you
don't
really
want
us
to
think
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
we
take
a
jury
verdict
as
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
we
should
do
something
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
you
were
saying
just
a
minute
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
were
saying
that
because
of
that
we
should
allow
you
to
take
two
bites
of
the
cherry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
double
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
find
that
a
jury
had
compassion,
then
we
give
you
another
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
need
that
argument
and
why
don't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
jury
could
have
turned
that
first
man
loose
because
they
thought
it
was
in
china.
that
is
not
compassion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
turned
that
jury
loose
because
the
government
didn't
prove
its
case.
they
could
have
turned
him
loose
for
50
different
reasons
without
it
being
"compassion."
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
here
to
answer
your
questions.
