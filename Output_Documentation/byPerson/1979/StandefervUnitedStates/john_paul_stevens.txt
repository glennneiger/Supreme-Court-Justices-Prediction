justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
you
are
just
making
a
statutory
construction.
you
wouldn't
say
--
would
you
say
that
congress
could
not
under
the
constitution
expressly
provide
for
convicting
the
aider
and
abettor
after
the
principal
is
acquitted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
position?
are
you
making
a
statutory
construction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
indicted
ten
people
at
the
same
time
and
they
all
moved
for
separate
trials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
acquitted,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
were
all
charged
with
exactly
the
same
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
argue
--
maybe
i
missed
it
in
your
brief
--
that
there
might
well
be
situations
in
which
there
would
be
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
first
defendant,
would
not
be
admissible
against
him.
but
it
could
nevertheless
prove
guilt
of
the
second
defendant,
which
makes
the
two
cases
quite
different
in
a
criminal
count.
do
you
argue
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
the
example
--
the
type
of
examples
in
your
footnote
29,
why
isn't
that
problem
adequately
handled
by
in
the
second
trial
the
government
simply
advising
the
trial
court
that
there
were
these
valid
objections
to
its
case
and
therefore
the
rule
shouldn't
apply
in
this
particular
case.
why
is
that
a
reason
for
not
applying
the
rule?
