justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gondelman,
after
having
read
your
113-page
brief
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
i
notice
that
nowhere
do
you
cite
dunn
v.
the
united
states,
which
is
justice
holmes'
old
opinion
saying
that
inconsistent
verdicts
in
juries
are
perfectly
permissible
under
the
constitution
and
the
federal
law.
do
you
think
you
can
win
this
case
without
overruling
the
dunn
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dunn
says
he
can
be
found
not
guilty
and
your
client
can
be
found
guilty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
isn't
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
these
united
states
supreme
court
cases
you
are
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
eight
years
i
have
been
sitting
here
black's
law
dictionary
has
never
been
thought
of
as
a
substitute
for
the
u.s.
reports.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
cite
dunn,
which
is
to
the
contrary
and
you
don't
urge
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
argument
is
even
weaker
than
dunn,
it
seems
to
me,
because
dunn
was
the
same
trial.
here
you
are
talking
about
two
separate
trials.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
narrow
issue
in
your
case
that
was
not
present
in
dunn.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
were
in
effect
when
your
client
was
tried.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
two
that
you
are
referring
to,
the
model
penal
code
and
the
revised
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
haven't
changed
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
other
charges
in
the
only
trial
to
which
he
was
subjected.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
was
charged
as
a
principal,
was
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
your
jury,
the
jury
concluded
all
the
issues
against
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
again
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
your
client
was
not
properly
chargeable
as
a
principal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
could
be
answered
"yes"
or
"no."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
that
evidence
can
come
in
during
the
course
of
a
trial
and
if
it
is
unobjected
to
the
indictment
need
not
be
formally
amended
under
the
rules.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
tried
the
aider
and
abettor
first?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
dunn
a
conspiracy
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
believe
it
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
be
able
to
call
on
him.
if
he
were
not
a
defendant
there
is
a
high
likelihood
he
would
assert
a
privilege
but
you
would
not
be
prohibited
from
calling
him
to
the
stand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
holds
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
ever
been
held
here?
