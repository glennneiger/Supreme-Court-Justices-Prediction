mr.
william
h.
alsup
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
one
who
aids,
abets,
counsels,
induces,
commands
or
procures
an
offense
against
the
united
states
may
be
convicted
for
doing
so
after
the
actual
perpretator
of
the
offense
is
acquitted
in
a
prior
suit.
in
the
present
case
the
evidence
clearly
showed
and
the
jury
found
that
petitioner
as
head
of
gulf
oil
corporation's
tax
division
and
acting
on
gulf's
behalf
gave
five,
authorized
five
all-expense-paid
vacations
to
the
internal
revenue
service
official
in
charge
of
the
ongoing
audits
of
gulf's
income
tax
liability.
although
petitioner
claimed
at
trial
that
these
gifts
were
made
out
of
friendship
and
for
social
reasons,
the
jury
found
to
the
contrary,
that
they
had
been
made
and
received
as
fees,
compensations
and
rewards
for
the
performance
of
the
irs
official's
duty
and
that,
accordingly,
the
official
violated
26
u.s.c.
7214
in
accepting
them.
in
turn,
the
jury
convicted
petitioner
of
the
five
counts
of
aiding
and
abetting
the
irs
official
and
the
unlawful
receipt
of
those
five
vacations.
there
was
one
count
for
each
vacation.
petitioner
challenges
three
of
those
counts.
petitioner
does
not
deny
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
against
him
or
assert
any
constitutional
affirmity
in
his
convictions.
rather,
his
basic
claim
in
this
case
rests
entirely
on
the
fact
that
in
a
prior
trial
the
irs
official
was
acquitted
of
the
charges
that
he
violated
section
7214
in
accepting
those
three
vacations.
although
i
might
add
that
on
two
of
those
three
vacations
he
was
convicted
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
201(g),
part
of
the
gratuities
statute.
in
turn,
petitioner
contends
that
those
acquittals
on
the
7214
counts
absolves
him
of
any
having
aided
and
abetted
the
unlawful
acceptance
of
those
three
vacations.
in
support
of
this
position
we
construe
petitioner
to
advance
two
basic
arguments.
one,
18
u.s.c.
does
not
authorize
the
prosecution
of
the
aider
and
abetter
after
the
actual
perpetrator
has
been
acquitted.
and,
two,
even
if
18
u.s.c.
2
--
that
is
the
general
aiding
and
abetting
statute
--
does
authorize
such
prosecution,
then
under
the
doctrine
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
the
prior
acquittal
of
niederberger,
the
irs
agent,
bars
petitioner's
conviction.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
it
actually
is.
i
believe
the
substance
of
the
argument
is
made
in
the
briefs.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
term
is
used.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
looking
strictly
at
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
itself,
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
itself
was
raised.
however,
the
--
that
doctrine,
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner
i
would
say
that
doctrine
is
somewhat
related
to
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
address.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
we
are
willing
to
assume
that
is
here
and
we
have
briefed
it
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
would
consider
deciding
it.
in
our
view
both
of
the
arguments,
the
statutory
argument
and
the
argument
based
on
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel,
are
unpersuasive.
petitioner's
first
argument
based
on
the
meaning
of
18
u.s.c.
2
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1909,
congress
intended
to
carry
forward
an
aspect
of
the
common
law
under
which
the
prior
acquittal
of
the
common
law
principle
precluded
conviction
of
the
common
law
accessory
before
the
fact.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
if
the
two
cases
had
been
tried
together,
it
would
have
been
absolutely
permissible
for
the
jury
to
reach
inconsistent
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
but
the
principle
that
was
announced
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
let
me
respond
to
that
point.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes,
the
dotterweich
case
did
involve
two
different
defendants.
one
was
a
corporation
and
one
was
the
officer
of
the
corporation.
and
the
jury
did
not
convict
the
corporation,
they
were
hung
with
respect
to
the
corporation.
but
they
did
convict
the
officer.
and
the
claim
that
was
made
was
that
it
was
inconsistent
to
convict
only
the
officer
and
not
the
corporation,
because
obviously
the
officer
was
simply
acting
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
this
court,
citing
dunn,
rejected
that
proposition.
now,
the
language
in
dunn
itself
is
actually
much
broader
than
what
could
be
termed
the
narrow
holding
of
the
case.
but
justice
holmes
did
say
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
consistency
in
jury
verdicts,
that
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
jury
system
in
this
country
is
that
juries
may
exercise
compassion
,
they
may
compromise.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
but
this
court
extended
that
reasoning
in
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
--
in
dotterweich.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that
is
because
there
never
was
any
thought
up
until
possibly
the
time
of
blonder-tongue
and
parklane
that
the
idea
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
was
just
unheard
of
at
the
time
dotterweich
and
dunn
were
decided.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
right.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
we
are
not
--
i
agree
with
your
general
statement
of
the
issue
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
we
would
agree
with
an
aspect
of
that
that
had
these
been
civil
cases
we
would
necessarily
agree
that
the
government
would
be
collaterally
stopped.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
it
would
depend.
you
know,
in
the
parkelane
case
and
in
blonder-tongue
they
were
specialized
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
more
than
that.
in
blonder-tongue
the
court
said
this
is
a
patent
case
or
special
considerations
here,
there
was
no
law
enforcement
aspect
of
the
case.
now,
if
we
had
a
civil
case
brought
by
the
government
where
there
were
some
law
enforcement
aspects
of
the
case,
that
might
inject
--
that
would
inject
a
new
consideration
into
the
calculus
that
wasn't
present
in
either
parklane
or
blonder-tongue.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
our
position
there,
once
again,
and
we
think
this
is
sustained
by
the
cases
in
the
court,
is
that
there
can
be
inconsistency
there,
too.
the
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
absolutely
the
same
result
there.
you
could
convict
conspirator
a
and
acquit
conspirator
b.
there
is
no
need
to
have
consistent
verdicts
in
such
a
trial.
and
that
is
even
true
in
the
case
where
there
are
only
two
named
conspirators.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
we
distinguish
all
those
in
our
brief
but
let
me
take
--
i
can
give
you
one
example.
morrison
is
perhaps
a
good
example
of
the
infirmity
in
that
reasoning
with
respect
to
each
of
those
cases.
in
the
morrison
case
there
were
two
people
who
allegedly
conspired
and
the
court
held
that
evidence
with
respect
to
one
of
them
was
based
upon
an
unconstitutional
presumption.
and
then
the
court
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
evidence
and
said,
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
in
this
record
that
would
support
a
finding
that
conspirator
no.
1
had
entered
into
any
agreement.
therefore,
because
there
was
an
absolute
failure
of
any
proof
with
respect
to
the
agreement
element,
the
conviction
was
invalid
with
respect
to
both.
that
case
does
not
hold
that
where
there
is
sufficient
evidence
with
respect
to
each
element
of
the
conspiracy
that
the
jury
couldn't
return
inconsistent
verdicts.
and
i
think
you
could
go
down
each
of
those
cases
that
the
petitioner
has
cited
on
that
point
and
everyone
of
them
can
be
reconciled
with
our
point
of
view.
turning
back
to
the
question
of
statutory
intent
with
respect
to
18
u.s.c.
2,
perhaps
i
should
briefly
say
that
the
reason
that
this
statute
was
enacted
in
the
first
place
involves
a
perverse
rule
under
the
common
law
that
originally
came
into
the
common
law
at
a
time
that
the
death
penalty
was
a
common
penalty
for
felonies
and
it
was
felt
there
was
some
procedural
protection
that
was
needed
to
protect
against
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
rule
worked
only
with
respect
to
a
term
known
only
to
the
common
law
and
that
was
accessories
before
the
fact.
just
to
contrast
it,
the
rule
even
at
common
law
with
respect
to
misdemeanors
was
that
everyone
who
was
in
any
way
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
a
crime
was
a
principal.
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
accessory
before
the
fact
for
misdemeanors.
moreover,
a
person
who
aided
and
abetted
and
was
present
at
a
crime,
that
is
a
felony
at
common
law,
also
could
be
charged
and
convicted
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
any
other
person
was
convicted
of
a
crime
and
that
person
was
regarded
as
a
principal.
now,
the
special
rule
that
applies
with
respect
to
accessories
before
fact
was
this.
an
accessory
before
the
fact
was
someone
who
was
not
present
at
the
scene
of
a
crime
but
who
aided
or
somehow
counseled
and
assisted
in
the
commission
of
the
offense.
that
person
could
not
be
even
prosecuted
until
the
principal
was
convicted
or
unless
they
were
charged
in
the
same
joint
trial.
and
that
was
part
of
this
procedural
safeguard
against
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
this
had
some
unfortunate
results.
for
example,
if
a
principal
just
couldn't
be
found,
then
the
accessory
before
the
fact
even
if
they
were
in
custody
could
not
be
brought
to
justice.
similarly,
if
the
principal
were
to
die,
then
the
principal
could
never
be
convicted
and
therefore
they
couldn't
be
accessory
before
the
fact,
could
not
be
brought
to
justice.
and,
more
to
the
point
of
this
case,
if
the
principal
were
tried
and
acquitted,
that
acquittal
would
forever
thereafter
bar
the
conviction
of
the
principal.
and
therefore
the
procedural
bar
rule
couldn't
be
satisfied
and
the
accessory
before
the
fact
thereafter
could
not
be
tried.
now,
with
the
waning
of
the
death
penalty,
most
of
the
states
eventually
abolished
that
distinction
altogether.
and
congress
in
1909
did
exactly
that
in
18
u.s.c.
2
which
provided
that
anyone
who
aided,
abetted,
counseled,
commanded,
induced
or
procured
an
offense
against
the
united
states
is
a
principal.
now,
by
defining
principal
to
include
all
aiders
and
abetters,
etc.,
the
statute
just
simply
abolished
the
category
of
accessories
before
the
fact.
and
since
this
category
is
the
very
predicate
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
the
1909
act
also
abolished
the
predicate
for
the
petitioner's
argument.
under
the
act
petitioner
is
not
an
accessory
before
the
fact
and
is
not
entitled
to
any
special
pleading
rules
but
is
punishable
to
the
same
extent
as
the
principal.
turning
to
the
second
of
the
petitioner's
arguments,
this
is
an
independent
argument
and
as
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
it
is
much
broader
than
the
statutory
argument
based
on
18
u.s.c.
2.
petitioner
as
did
judge
gibbons
below,
argues
that
the
conviction
of
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
aiding
and
abetting
counts,
as
to
those
three
counts,
is
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
since
1948,
i
believe
it
was
the
bernhard
v.
bank
of
america
case
in
the
california
supreme
court,
not
a
federal
case
at
all,
was
the
first
time
that
a
major
court
in
this
country
adopted
it.
i
would
say
1948
still
qualifies
as
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
believe
that
was
defensive
in
that
case.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
it
was
the
first
major
case,
it
is
the
leading
case.
there
may
have
been
lower
court
cases
before
that,
i
am
not
aware
of
them.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
1948.
now,
we
contend
that
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
is
unavailable
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
traditionally
collateral
estoppel
is
available
only
if
there
is
mutuality
in
the
application
of
the
doctrine.
that
occurs
where
both
parties
in
the
present
case
were
parties
to
the
prior
case,
or
at
least
weren't
privity
with
someone
who
was
a
party
to
the
prior
case.
in
the
present
case
the
petitioner
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
in
which
mr.
niederberger
was
acquitted.
therefore,
he
is
not
entitled
under
the
mutuality
requirement
to
invoke
the
benefit.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
actually
there
was
overlapping
evidence.
actually
there
was
new
evidence.
this
is
not
a
case
where
it
is
identical
evidence.
now,
there
was
quite
a
number
of
different
battle
lines
formed
in
the
second
case
because
new
evidence
came
to
light
in
the
interval.
so
it
cannot
be
said
that
this
was
a
case
which
the
jury
in
niederberger's
case
and
in
standefer's
case
had
identical
evidence
before
them.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
one
of
the
theories
that
went
to
the
jury
in
this
case
was
that
each
of
these
five
vacations,
these
were
not
just
vacations
to
the
local
golfing
club
but
these
involved
pebble
beach,
los
vegas,
miami,
absecon,
new
jersey
and
pompano
beach,
florida,
all
at
the
expense
of
gulf
oil
company
and
lasting
on
the
average
of
four
days
apiece.
each
of
these
seemed
to
occur
within
one
or
two
months
of
important
events
in
the
ongoing
audits
of
gulf
oil
corporation's
taxes
and
mr.
niederberger
was
in
the
position
to
make
all
the
critical
decisions
with
respect
to
those
audits
at
that
time.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
a
question
that
no
one
has
raised
so
far
and
i
--
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
would
say
"yes,"
but
i
am
not
--
there
might
be
problems
with
that
rule
--
i
believe
it
is
called
wharton's
rule.
i
am
just
not
quite
sure
whether
there
could
be
a
conspiracy
indictment
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
the
reasons
that
we
think
that
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
ought
not
to
be
applied
to
criminal
cases
are
as
follows.
first
of
all,
unlike
the
civil
case,
extension
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
to
criminal
cases
would
frustrate
the
important
overriding
interest
in
prompt
and
complete
enforcement
of
federal
criminal
statutes.
it
would
do
this
in
at
least
two
ways.
one
of
the
premises
of
our
penal
system
is
that
each
person
who
commits
a
crime
will
be
held
individually
accountable
for
the
commission
of
that
crime.
in
a
sense,
that
was
the
whole
point
of
18
u.s.c.
2,
which
was
to
do
away
with
these
procedural
bars
and
to
allow
each
person
to
be
charged
as
principal.
if
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
were
introduced
into
the
criminal
courts,
then
when
a
jury
made
an
erroneous
decision
exercising
compassion
or
compromise
or
whatever,
the
effect
of
that
erroneous
acquittal
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
would
be
spread
to
all
of
the
participants
charged
with
a
common
fact
in
that
crime.
and
that
would
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
follow
you.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
unless
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that
is
right,
there
could
be
some
horrendous
results
if
no.
a
--
if
no.
1
defendant
was
acquitted
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
--
then
the
rest
of
them
--
at
least
if
there
were
a
common
factual
issue
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that
is
correct.
then
there
might
not
even
be
identical
inquiry
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
common
factual
issue.
an
example
along
those
lines
that
might
occur
would
be
something
like
this.
let
us
say
that
the
government
charged
a
so-called
underling
with
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense.
and
the
conspiracy
alleged
that
the
underling
had
conspired
with
say
someone
say
named
mr.
big,
one
of
the
higher-up's
in
an
operation.
and
the
jury
exercised
compassion
against
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence,
the
jury
decided
to
compromise
convict
on
the
substantive
offense,
acquit
on
the
conspiracy.
now,
under
the
petitioner's
theory
the
government
would
be
forever
barred
from
going
after
the
higher-up,
because
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
for
conspiracy.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
not
in
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
don't
believe
that
actually
even
--
there
are
courts
i
will
say,
there
are
courts
of
appeals
who
have
held
exactly
that.
but
you
could
not
regard
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
i
won't
dispute
that.
but
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
that
is
a
settled
rule
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
are
courts
of
appeals
who
have
held
that
but
this
court
has
certainly
never
held
that.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
we
don't.
actually,
this
court
has
not
handled
the
problem
that
way.
in
dotterweich
and
the
dunn
case
this
very
court
said
and
recognized
that
juries
often
exercise
compassion
or
compromise
or
inconsistency
and
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
what
i
was
saying
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
i
am
saying
because
the
court
has
recognized
that
kind
of
compromise
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
we
feel
some
obligation
to
make
all
the
arguments
we
feel
have
merit.
it
is
true
we
don't
need
that
particular
argument
to
win
this
case.
but,
you
know,
the
double
jeopardy
argument
is
really
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
justice,
would
you
feel
the
same
way
if
there
was
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt
in
that
case?
mr.
william
h.
alsup
our
point
is
that
we
don't
feel
that
way
when
there
is
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
to
us
the
logical
inference,
as
this
court
has
recognized
from
time
to
time,
is
that
juries
do
exercise
compassion.
now,
you
are
right,
in
the
ashe
case
the
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
fact
that
there
might
be
compassion,
in
that
passage
where
the
court
talks
about
we
will
assume
the
rational
verdict.
but
that
is
because
the
court
was
dealing
with
double
jeopardy
and
in
order
to
safeguard
the
constitutional
right
against
excessive
prosecutions
the
court
rightly
decided
we
will
not
indulge
or
recognize
the
fact
that
juries
indulge
in
compassion.
we
are
not
dealing
with
double
jeopardy
here.
this
is
solely
a
judge-made
rule
of
prudential
considerations
as
to
whether
or
not
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
ought
to
be
applied
to
criminal
cases.
and
just
as
the
judge
made
rule
concerning
inconsistent
verdicts,
takes
that
factor
into
account,
the
compassion
factor,
so
it
should
be
taken
into
account
here.
another
reason
why
civil
cases
are
different
is
because
in
criminal
cases
the
united
states
does
not
have
the
same
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
factual
determinations
that
are
available
in
civil
cases.
the
rule
of
this
problem
is
the
so-called
jury
nullification
which,
again,
the
court
has
recognized
that
that
goes
on
in
the
jury
room.
but
it
begins
even
before
that
point.
there
is
no
discovery
in
criminal
cases.
there
are
privileges
that
prohibit
the
government
from
taking
the
depositions
of
the
principals
to
the
primary
transactions
at
issue
in
a
trial.
there
is
no
directed
verdict
that
the
government
can
ask
for
when
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
overwhelming.
there
is
no
summary
judgment
motion.
and
when
the
jury
does
exercise
compassion,
we
can't
go
and
ask
for
a
judgment
nov
and
say
set
aside
that
jury
verdict
or
ask
for
a
new
trial
because
the
verdict
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
nor
can
we
even
appeal
the
jury's
factual
determinations.
and
the
sanabria
case,
in
fact
this
court
said
"no
matter
how
egregious
the
error
may
be
the
government
just
has
no
recourse
against
that."
now,
that
is
a
big
difference
between
the
criminal
case
and
the
civil
case.
and
in
the
criminal
case
the
government
typically
does
not
have
the
same
full
and
fair
opportunity
that
is
available
in
civil
cases.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
we
did.
we
intended
to
argue
it
and
i
think
we
had
a
long
footnote
in
which
we
refer
to
fourth
amendment
problem
that
you
just
mentioned.
and
that
would
mean
that,
for
example,
in
case
no.
1
certain
evidence
that
is
crucial
might
be
excluded
but
it
would
be
available
to
be
used
in
case
no.
2.
and
that
once
again
is
part
of
the
problem
that
the
government
faces
in
having
the
same
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
an
issue
that
is
available
in
civil
cases,
because
in
civil
cases
these
exclusionary
rules
just
aren't
problems.
but
they
are
big
problems
in
criminal
trials.
now,
it
is
footnote
29,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
our
brief
is
where
we
refer
to
that
problem.
i
see
my
time
is
running
out.
i
would
just
say
briefly
that
there
are
other
reasons
why
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
ought
not
to
be
applied
in
criminal
cases.
briefly,
one
is
that
the
inquiry
into
determining
whether
or
not
the
government
had
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
and
exactly
what
issue
was
previously
decided
might
be
an
exhaustive
inquiry
in
cases
and
given
the
fact
that
it
is
the
united
states
--
this
is
really
the
only
one
who
has
an
interest
here
--
the
united
states
often
takes
into
account
the
outcomes
of
prior
trials
and
is
not
like
an
ordinary
civil
litigant
and
may
not
repeat
litigation
except
where
in
the
interest
of
justice
we
think
it
is
necessary.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
theoretically
you
could
make
an
inquiry
into
exactly
what
evidence
was
excluded
at
the
first
trial,
what
evidence
wasn't
even
offered
because
they
knew
it
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
problems.
for
example,
in
this
case,
in
the
niederberger
case
we
couldn't
even
call
standefer
as
a
witness
in
the
first
case
and
we
didn't
even
try
because
we
knew
he
would
invoke
his
--
so
there
wasn't
any
exclusion
per
se
but
it
was
just
not
done
because
of
--but
you
are
right.
those
factors
could
all
be
listed,
the
judge
at
the
second
trial
could
try
to
take
all
those
into
account
and
then
the
judge
could
turn
to
the
issue
of
what
was
actually
decided
by
the
first
jury.
our
point
is
that
that
would
be
a
very
exhaustive
inquiry
in
each
case
and
most
of
the
time
the
judge
is
going
to
find
there
wasn't
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
and
it
is
just
not
worth
the
candle
to
make
that
inquiry
in
so
many
cases
where
it
would
undoubtedly
be
raised
repeatedly,
simply
in
the
very
small
number
of
cases
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
doctrine
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel.
if
the
whole
point,
or
if
one
of
the
major
points
is
to
save
time
of
the
courts,
we
think
this
would
waste
time
of
the
courts,
not
actually
save
it.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct
and
that
might
be
a
reason
why
in
most
cases
the
judges
in
the
second
case
would
rule
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
right.
we
could
call
him
to
the
stand
and
a
although
it
might
be
an
abuse
of
prosecutorial
discretion
to
call
someone
knowing
they
are
going
to
invoke
the
privilege.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
that
is
just
in
trial
courts
commonly
understood.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
our
argument
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it
would
or
would
not
be.
in
many
cases
even
if
the
potential
defendant
would
simply
invoke
the
privilege
and
no
evidence
would
come
in
at
the
first
trial.
thank
you
very
much.
