we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
standefer
against
the
united
states.
mr.
gondelman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

e.
burger
what
was
the
page,
76?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
mr.
niederberger
had
dropped
dead
even
before
he
was
indicted
do
you
think
that
would
preclude
indictment
and
conviction
of
standefer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
your
argument
mean
the
inconsistent
verdict
and
the
idea
of
a
compromise
verdict
would
be
washed
out.
isn't
it
possible
that
this
first
jury
for
niederberger
simply
reached
a
compromise
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
what
justice
holmes
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
in
dunn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make,
mr.
gondelman,
whether
you
paid
in
advance,
cash
on
delivery,
or
30
or
60
days
later,
which
is
the
way
doctors
and
lawyers
send
their
bills?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alsup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
show
in
the
way
of
a
pattern
of
conduct
in
terms
of
standefer's
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
some
state
supreme
courts
it
has
been
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
