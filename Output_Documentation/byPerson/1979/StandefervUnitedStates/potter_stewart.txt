they
indicted

and
tried

and

was

of

ashe

the
double

clause,

being

justice

stewart
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
trying
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
all
the
time.
with
reference
to
the
dunn
v.
united
states
and
inconsistent
verdicts
and
that
problem,
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
two
cases
had
been
tried
as
one,
it
had
been
a
joint
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
are
separate
trials?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
alsup,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
that
term
"nonmutual
collateral
estoppel"
used
once
in
the
other
brief,
the
opposing
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
collateral
estoppel
argument
is
fairly
embraced
by
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
you
are
willing
to
assume
it
is
here,
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
interrupt
to
clarify
one
thing
that
i
am
not
sure
about.
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
what
would
be
the
proper
disposition
if
the
two
cases
had
been
tried
together?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
rely
on
dunn
in
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
conspiracy
cases,
where
you
indict
mr.
a
for
conspiring
with
mr.
b
and
he
is
acquitted.
and
how
about
then
trying
mr.
b
for
conspiracy?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you
tried
them
both
in
one
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cases
that
your
colleague
relies
on,
morrison
v.
california,
you
don't
put
much
into
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
alsup,
before
you
get
into
this
argument,
i
just
want
to
raise
on
question.
in
our
earlier
argument
we
talked
about
this
is
a
brand
new
concept
with
blonder-tongue
and
the
like.
isn't
it
correct
that
the
concept
of
offensive
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
is
rather
new,
as
those
cases.
but
the
concept
of
defensive
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
is
something
that
has
been
around
quite
a
while?
justice
potter
stewart
as
defensive
collateral
estoppel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
first
case
it
applied
that
to?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
what,
1948?
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
at
the
same
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
an
interesting
question,
whether
to
a
try
a
defendant
separately.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
the
only
time
the
government
could
ever
convict
a,
they
would
have
to
convict
them
all
at
once
or
not
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
for
conspiracy.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
a
pretty
well
settled
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
did
so
when
i
was
a
member
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
rely
on
the
inability
to
call
standefer,
that
would
be
a
circumstance
always
present,
wouldn't
it?
you
would
never
be
able
to
call
the
second
defendant
as
a
potential
witness
in
a
joint
transaction.
he
would
assert
his
privilege.
