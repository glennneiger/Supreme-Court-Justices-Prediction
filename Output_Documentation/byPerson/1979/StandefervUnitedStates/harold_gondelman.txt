mr.
harold
gondelman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
opinion
in
u.s.
v.
standefer
appealed
from
is
now
reported
at
610
f.2d
1076.
it
had
not
been
when
we
prepared
our
briefs.
mr.
harold
gondelman
1076.
610
f.2d
1076.
in
this
case
mr.
standefer
was
indicted
on
a
9-count
indictment,
the
odd
counts
of
which
charged
him
with
violation
of
26
u.s.c.
7214(a)(2),
the
event
counts
of
which
charged
18
u.s.c.
201(f).
having
read
the
72-page
opinion,
majority
and
minority
opinions
of
the
court
en
banc
and
the
three-judge
panel,
the
circuit
court
withdrew
their
original
opinion
when
they
did
order
a
hearing
before
the
court
en
bank.
but
in
reviewing
that
and
in
reviewing
the
briefs
in
this
case,
it
sort
of
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
the
alice-in-wonderland
story
when
alice
says
to
the
big
rabbit,
"where
do
i
start?"
and
the
rabbit
said,
"you
start
at
the
beginning,
you
proceed
to
the
end
and
then
stop.
"now,
in
this
case
as
a
defense
lawyer
and
trial
counsel
in
the
court
below,
when
i
received
the
indictment
and
the
privilege
of
representing
mr.
standefer
i
didn't
start
with
the
legislative
history
in
1908,
which
was
five
years
before
the
16th
amendment,
which
allowed
income
tax
laws
to
be
passed
to
create
a
bureaucracy
that
they
now
want
to
apply
the
legislative
history
of
1908
to.
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
will
address
myself
directly
to
that,
because
in
order
to
start
in
this
case
you
must
start
by
leading
the
indictment
against
mr.
standefer
and,
unfortunately,
no
court
has
yet
got
to
the
indictment
that
i
thought
i
was
trying.
let
me
show
your
honor
why
i
think
and
did
not
discuss
justice
holmes'
case,
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
if
i
may
say
so.
the
indictment
in
this
case
says
that
mr.
standefer
did
on
or
about
--
and
i
won't
go
through
all
the
odd
counts,
but
each
start
with
a
date
--
did
aid
and
abet
cyril
j.
niederberger,
an
officer
and
employee
of
the
united
states,
acting
in
connection
with
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states,
namely
a
supervisory
internal
revenue
agent
--
skipping
dates
--
in
unlawfully
and
knowingly
receiving
a
fee,
compensation
and
reward
as
set
forth
below
which
was
not
prescribed
by
law
for
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
an
internal
revenue
service
agent.
now,
when
i
read
that
indictment
i
then
to
make
certain
that
all
courts
would
be
able
to
correlate
very
clearly
what
i
am
talking
about,
in
my
motion
to
dismiss
i
attached
the
count
1
indictment
against
standefer
with
the
count
2
indictment
against
niederberger
so
that
we
could
see
exactly
what
the
same
party
--
that
is
the
united
states
of
america
--
under
its
grand
jury
charged
mr.
niederberger
with
as
well
as
mr.
standefer
with.
and
at
pages
28-a
on,
you
will
see
that
the
grand
jury
indictment
against
mr.
niederberger
says
that
from
on
or
about
the
same
dates
that
standefer
is
charged
with
having
given
the
fee,
compensation
and
reward
to
an
officer
employee
niederberger
--
and
no
one
else,
niederberger
--
that
mr.
niederberger
did
receive
the
golf
trip
in
the
exact
amount
on
the
exact
date
to
the
same
place
at
the
same
time.
mr.
harold
gondelman
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
long
past
the
need
to
try
the
principal
or
convict
the
principal.
but
when
the
government
of
the
united
states
chooses
to
indict
the
principal,
and
they
are
supposed
to
know
the
law,
and
in
order
to
have
some
kind
of
semblance
of
uniformity
across
this
country
of
ours,
because
each
u.s.
attorney
may
act
differently
and
does,
if
niederberger
was
not
tried
there
would
not
be
a
mutual
collateral
estoppel,
there
would
not
be
a
finding
by
a
jury
that
he
did
not
in
fact
commit
the
crime,
and
that
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
harold
gondelman
and
he
was
found
not
guilty
on
three
counts.
mr.
harold
gondelman
but,
justice
rehnquist,
in
every
case
that
is
decided
and
every
circuit
that
is
reported,
and
interestingly
enough
you
ask
why
i
didn't
comment
on
u.s.
v.
dunn,
why
didn't
the
government
talk
about
one
case
cited
on
page
9
of
my
brief
where
if
you
try
the
principal
and
the
aider
and
abettor
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
understand
that.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in
every
case
that
has
been
passed
upon
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
there
are
cases
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
where
if
you
try
two
conspirators
and
only
two
conspirators
and
one
is
found
not
guilty,
there
can
be
no
conspiracy.
so
you
really
have
to
get
to
the
nub
of
whether
or
not
i
can
also
win
this
case
because
i
think
the
charge
is
incorrect,
and
that
is
raised
on
this
appeal,
and
that
the
judge
below
in
his
charge
said
you
don't
have
to
find
an
agreement.
now,
that
is
why
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
indictment.
what
does
the
indictment
say?
standefer
cannot
be
indicted,
as
we
all
know,
under
7214(a)(2).
it
only
applies
to
an
employee
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
he
can
only
be
indicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
now,
if
we
want
to
look
at
definitions
we
have
to
look
at
black's
law
dictionary
which
says
that
aiding
and
abetting,
as
cited
on
page
15
of
my
brief,
implies
knowledge.
it
comprehends
all
assistance
rendered
by
words,
acts
and
so
forth.
it
is
not
sufficient
that
there
is
a
mere
negative
acquiescence
not
in
any
way
made
known
to
the
principal
malefactor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
it
may
not.
but
you
see,
aiding
and
abetting
i
think
connotes
a
certain
action
on
the
part
of
an
aider
and
abettor.
you
cannot
aid
and
abet
nobody,
as
judge
aldisert
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
when
you
do
have
one
who
is
charged
that
he
did
aid
and
abet
niederberger
and
niederberger
must
have
received
a
fee
compensation
or
award
by
reason
of
official
acts
to
be
performed,
performed
or
to
be
performed
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
sir.
in
this
case
it
was
found
that
he
didn't.
it
was
found
that
niederberger
did
not
receive
a
fee
compensation
reward
in
counts
1,
3
and
5.
he
was
found
not
guilty.
but
even
as
to
the
counts
in
which
he
was
found
guilty
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
now,
when
the
aider
and
abettor
goes
to
trial,
justice
white,
i
suggest
to
you
that
contrary
to
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury
in
which
he
said
you
do
not
have
to
find
an
agreement
between
standefer
and
niederberger,
it
is
sufficient
if
he
received
as
the
large
case
auditor
of
gulf
oil
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
and
i
suggest
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
found
as
to
all
counts,
yes.
mr.
harold
gondelman
the
principal
was
found
guilty
at
a
retrial
by
the
same
government.
mr.
harold
gondelman
but
then
i
get
to
the
next
point,
mr.
justice
white,
and
that
is
that
under
the
instructions
this
jury
was
a
very
intelligent
jury.
after
three
hours
of
deliberation
they
sent
a
note
to
the
court
saying
is
intent
important
in
any
of
the
nine
counts
of
this
indictment.
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
answer
to
that
was
a
very
simple
"yes."
the
court
then
called
the
jury
back
and
not
only
said
"yes"
but
then
proceeded
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
did
not
have
to
find
an
agreement
between
the
principal
and
the
aider
and
abettor
and
in
fact
all
they
had
to
do
was
find
that
a
gratuity
was
paid
for
a
speedy
audit
of
which
there
was
everything
but
evidence
of
that.
these
cases
show
that
the
irs
was
auditing
1960
cases
in
1971.
but
he
said
if
you
find
that
it
was
by
reason
of
a
speedy
audit
or
a
favorable
result,
which
brings
me
to
the
third
point
of
my
argument.
if
you
find
that
it
is
a
favorable
result,
and
i
cited
bollenbach
to
show
that
the
last
ditch
instructions
of
a
judge
to
a
jury
is
the
one
that
carries
out
a
dictum
back
in
about
an
hour
after
those
instructions,
which
left
them
nothing
to
decide,
took
complete
defense
away
from
the
jury,
they
came
back
within
an
hour
of
a
verdict
of
guilty.
because
i
wanted
to
show
and
in
fact
did
show
that
gulf
oil
over
the
period
of
these
audits
have
paid
$150
million
in
additional
taxes.
i
showed
and
could
show
that
in
each
case
what
the
irs
did
here
and
the
government
did
here,
they
did
not
find
a
specific
act
for
which
these
golf
trips
were
taken.
they
found
that
an
audit
had
been
turned
in
by
the
audit
team
of
which
niederberger
was
a
part,
then
they
went
back
from
there
to
see
if
they
could
relate
a
golf
trip
to
the
audit.
and
if
they
took
place
2
or
3
months
after
the
audit
had
been
filed,
the
judge
then
told
the
jury
that
this
could
be
fee
compensation
or
reward.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
gondelman
no.
i
think
the
fact
that
a
jury
has
passed
upon
the
innocence
of
niederberger
precludes
when
a
judge
should
be
able
to
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that
into
the
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
would
hope
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes.
i
am
urging
this
court
to
say
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
its
u.s.
attorneys
you
are
no
different
than
any
other
litigant.
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
urge
in
my
brief.
your
honor,
that
non-mutual
collateral
estoppel,
ashe
v.
swenson,
should
be
applied
to
this
situation
where
the
government
--
and
this
is
where
i
suggest
respectfully
to
this
court
you
can
say
it
to
the
u.s.
attorneys
across
the
land,
do
not
indict
a
principal
and
then
if
he
is
acquitted
come
back
and
unfairly
then
try
on
the
same
facts.
it
is
a
narrow
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
not
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
would
say,
sir,
that
if
the
identical
facts
were
presented
to
a
jury
in
this
country
and
a
jury
has
found
against
one
government
of
the
united
states,
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
barred
just
like
any
other
litigant.
mr.
harold
gondelman
but
i
am
also
talking,
justice
rehnquist,
about
a
narrow
issue
that
does
not
--
was
not
presenting
dunn
and
is
not
present
in
all
the
hypothetical
cases
that
we
can
conjure
up
to
show
why
it
doesn't
apply.
for
example,
if
the
principal
is
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
there
can
only
be
one
recipient
and
guilty
principal
in
standefer,
and
that
is
mr.
niederberger.
and
it
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
a
suppression
of
evidence,
you
don't
have
entrapment,
you
don't
have
a
principal
who
wasn't
tried,
you
don't
have
all
the
things
that
has
to
be
found
in
order
to
avoid
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
only
main
principal,
the
only
main
principal
who
could
commit
the
principal
offense,
was
acquitted.
mr.
harold
gondelman
if
congress
ever
passes
the
new
penal
code,
it
will
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
argument.
but
it
also
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
right
now
i
am
making
a
statutory
construction
argument
because
the
model
penal
code
and
the
one
now
pending
before
congress
would
indicate
that
it
its
legislative
intent
when
it
passed
the
1951
and
1909
aiding
and
abetting
statutes
was
that
an
acquitted
principal
would
bar
the
trial
of
the
aider
and
abettor,
because
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
which,
sir?
mr.
harold
gondelman
congress
has
not
yet
passed
what
it
is
considering.
but
the
fact
that
you
now
have
legislation
pending
before
congress
indicating
that
they
want
to
pass
a
law
saying
that
the
acquittal
of
the
principal
will
not
bar
the
trial
of
the
aider
and
abettor,
in
my
understanding
of
statutory
construction,
would
indicate
that
when
mr.
standefer
went
to
trial
and
until
today
the
acquittal
of
the
principal
is
in
fact
a
bar
because
they
are
changing
the
law.
mr.
harold
gondelman
therefore,
having
indicated
they
would
like
to
do
it,
sir,
i
think
it
indicates
congressional
intent
was
to
the
contrary
in
1951
when
they
passed
the
aider
and
abettor
amendment.
mr.
harold
gondelman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
that
is
the
trouble
to
looking
to
legislative
intent
and
i
think,
your
honor,
in
u.s.
versus
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
think
in
this
country
it
has
to
be
that,
sir.
and
i
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
as
i
understand
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
and
also
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
of
course
then
he
couldn't
have
been
aided
and
abetted,
you
see.
but
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
they
did
find
that
he
was
not
guilty
and
i
understood
that
when
mr.
niederberger
went
to
trial
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
the
constitutional
rule
that
i
would
apply
is
the
application
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
that
was
discussed
in
ashe
v.
swenson.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
i
think
justice
stewart
went
through
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
as
a
principle
established
by
this
court,
applicable
to
criminal
cases
as
well
as
civil
cases.
mr.
harold
gondelman
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
this
is
why
i
call
it
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
you
see.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
of
course
anything
is
possible,
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
in
dunn
he
said
that.
but
i
might
also
cite
benton
v.
maryland
to
your
honors
in
answer
to
that
question,
because
your
honor
said
and
justice
harlan
stated
the
state
has
no
more
interest
in
compelling
petitioner
to
stand
trial
again,
recognizing
that
is
double
jeopardy,
for
larceny
of
which
he
had
been
acquitted
than
in
retrying
any
other
person
declared
innocent
after
an
error
free
trial.
now,
i
don't
know
why
the
ali
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
keep
saying
that
because
a
man
is
found
not
guilty
in
the
american
system
of
justice
that
it
is
somehow
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
the
fact
is
niederberger
had
a
trial,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
he
was
presumed
innocent,
he
was
acquitted
of
three
charges.
i
thought
in
america
that
meant
that
he
is
innocent.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
correct.
and
on
those
other
trials
i
then
get
to
the
argument
when
justice
white
took
me
back
to
the
question
of
the
constitution.
and
it
is
a
stronger
argument,
if
you
will,
and
that
is
that
if
a
principal
must
receive
a
fee,
compensation
or
reward,
there
must
necessarily
be
an
agreement
between
the
principal
and
the
aider
and
abettor
who
is
charged
as
an
aider
and
abettor
in
giving
him
a
fee,
compensation
or
reward,
because
if
he
doesn't
give
it
as
a
fee,
compensation
or
reward
and
if
it
isn't
received
as
fee,
compensation
or
reward,
there
is
no
substantive
offense
committed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
justice
marshall,
what
i
am
talking
about
now
is
a
factual
condition
to
be
presented
to
a
jury.
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
gondelman
in
this
case,
absolutely
not,
because
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
no.
the
judge
specifically
said
to
this
jury,
sir,
that
you
do
not
have
to
find
an
agreement
between
mr.
standefer
--
and
i
have
that
covered
in
my
brief,
i
can
point
it
out.
but
the
fact
is
that
at
page
87-a
of
the
appendix
judge
knox
charged
the
jury
specifically
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
find
intent.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
returns
were
correct
is
irrelevant
to
their
consideration.
mr.
harold
gondelman
he
is
charged
as
a
principal
but
you
still
have
to
have
a
substantive
offense.
he
can't
be
charged
as
a
principal
without
having
7214(a)(2)
violated
by
niederberger.
that
is
the
difference
between
dunn
and
bryan
and
the
cases
which
say
if
you
have
an
innocent
dupe,
standefer
could
not
be
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting
an
innocent
dupe.
and
that
is
the
difference
between
u.s.
v.
dunn
and
any
other
case
that
is
recorded.
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
it
concluded
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
but
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honor
that
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
that
the
jury
could
only
pass
upon
what
a
judge
charged
that
they
could
pass
upon.
and
in
this
case
the
judge
took
away
from
them
two
ingredients
that
are
crucial
to
the
defense.
one,
there
must
be
an
agreement
between
the
principal
in
this
kind
of
a
case
who
has
to
receive
a
fee
compensation
reward
and
an
aider
and
abettor
who
must
pay
the
fee
compensation
reward.
if
niederberger
had
received
it
differently
or
if
standefer
took
him
on
golf
trips
for
different
reasons
even
though
he
received
it
as
a
fee
compensation
reward,
the
intent
after
the
jury
came
back
and
asked
about
intent
the
judge
said
intent
is
unimportant.
if
he
did
it
for
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasons
without
specifying
any
particular
act.
so
i
am
challenging
and
i
took
exception
and
you
will
see
i
continue
to
take
exception
to
the
charge
where
judge
knox
said,
"you
don't
need
intent."
i
said,
"well,
what
is
this
malum
prohibitum
nonsense?
if
you
have
an
irs
agent
and
you
buy
him
a
cup
of
coffee,
you
take
him
to
lunch,
you
take
him
on
a
golf
trip
you
are
guilty
of
a
crime.
you
don't
need
intent."
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
am
saying
that
the
judge
did
not
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
he
was
not
properly
charged
as
a
principal
for
the
three
counts
of
which
niederberger
was
acquitted.
on
the
others,
yes.
but
in
order
to
have
a
jury
pass
upon
the
facts,
the
jury
must
have
had
an
opportunity
to
recognize
that
the
bahamas
actually
point
in
the
post-watergate
syndrome
we
have
in
this
country,
gulf
oil
was
supposed
to
have
given
political
contributions
through
a
corporation
called
bahamas
x.
i
still
say
it
is
nice
to
get
back
to
the
beginning,
it
is
the
indictment.
the
indictment
in
this
case,
8
and
9
charges
and,
again,
if
we
only
stick
to
what
i
am
suppose
to
be
defending
which
is
in
the
indictment,
much
of
what
your
honors
are
asking
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
this
indictment.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
correct
but
you
still
have
to
charge
a
jury
properly,
i
think,
so
that
they
might
consider.
in
bollenbach,
you
see,
after
going
through
all
of
that
this
court
said
the
charge
on
inference
at
the
last
ditch
charge
of
the
judge
was
wrong,
so
you
reversed.
and
that
is
where
i
am,
i
am
at
the
point
where
a
judge
charged
this
jury
and
took
my
defense
away
on
all
counts
of
the
indictment,
whether
you
want
us
to
go
to
trial
on
nine
counts
or
six
counts.
but
on
every
count,
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
and
i
have
covered
the
legislative
intent
on
201(f)
where
senator
keating
has
talked
about
this
is
not
a
malum
prohibitum
statute,
he
wanted
to
make
it
such
and
it
wasn't
passed
as
such.
but
in
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
your
honor,
and
every
case
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
sir.
in
fact
i
have
relied
on
the
fact
that
in
joint
trials
--
see,
what
i
object
to
is
the
government
being
able
to
pick
and
choose
and
have
a
different
result.
in
the
joint
trial
every
appellate
court
that
has
had
it,
every
circuit
court
that
has
had
it,
have
said
that
you
must
charge
a
jury
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
if
you
acquit
the
principal,
you
must
acquit
the
aider
and
abettor.
now,
why
should
you
let
a
u.s.
attorney
try
the
principal
and
then
come
back
and
say
now
we
don't
apply
that
principle
of
law.
that
is
the
law
in
this
country,
up
at
least
up
to
this
point.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
up
to
this
point
no
court
has
said
that.
but
i
might
also
say
in
connection
with
the
charge
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
in
dunn,
as
i
recall
it,
and
all
the
cases
that
i
have
read
in
connection
with
inconsistent
verdicts
say,
well,
one
jury
could
--
for
example,
the
conspiracy
cases.
if
you
charge
only
two
named
conspirators
and
one
is
acquitted,
every
court
has
said
there
is
no
conspiracy.
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
have
it
in
my
brief
and
i
do
have
it
cited.
if
i
can
have
a
moment,
i
will
catch
it
for
your
honor.
but
the
issue
--
i
have
the
conspiracy
cases
cited,
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
--
on
page
36
of
my
brief
morrison
v.
california,
which
held
conspiracy
imports
a
corrupt
agreement
between
not
less
than
two.
now,
in
those
cases
where
you
have
only
two
named
conspirators
or
alleged
conspirators,
one
is
found
not
guilty,
morrison
says
the
other
has
to
go
free.
and
there
are
lots
of
lower
court
cases
to
that
effect.
however,
if
you
have
the
conspiracy
between
two
and
other
persons
know
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
pardon
me?
mr.
harold
gondelman
morrison
v.
california,
291
u.s.
82,
92,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
i
do,
at
page
56
of
my
brief,
your
honor,
i
have
it.
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
291
u.s.
82
at
page
92.
hartzel
v.
united
states,
322
u.s.
680.
bates
v.
united
states,
323
u.s.
15.
u.s.
v.
fox,
130
f.2d
and
so
forth,
and
so
on.
i
have
a
myriad
of
cases
which
hold
that
as
the
principle
and
i
think
you
have
to
say
it.
to
me
it
is
as
logical
to
say
two
people
must
conspire
to
convict
two
and
you
can't
have
one
as
it
is
to
say
that
you
can't
convict
an
aider
and
abettor
of
an
innocent
principal.
and
it
does
not
make
sense
to
me
that
you
allow
the
united
states
attorneys
to
pick
and
choose
the
time
in
which
one
will
come
to
trial
or
the
other
will
come
to
trial
and
say
in
one
case
after
you
come
the
trial
together
you
must
charge
the
jury
that
if
a
principal
is
acquitted,
acquit
the
aider
and
abettor.
but
if
i
happen
to
choose
as
u.s.
attorney
to
try
the
principal
first,
and
then
the
aider
and
abettor,
a
different
result
obtains.
and
it
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
harold
gondelman
there
are
cases
on
that
too,
your
honor.
you
will
see
in
lower
court
cases
where
the
aider
and
abettor
is
tried
first
and
the
verdict
against
the
principal
has
been
reversed,
the
court
of
appeals
has
vacated
on
its
own
motion
the
aider
and
abettor
--
and
i
have
that
cited
in
my
brief
--
vacated
the
aider
and
abettor
conviction
because
they
say
it
is
nonsense
to
allow
the
principal
to
go
back
and
be
acquitted
and
the
aider
and
abettor
would
end
up
being
convicted.
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
harold
gondelman
but
again,
the
difference
between
them
is
there
are
cases
that
can
--
there
are
crimes
that
can
be
committed
by
innocent
dupes.
in
this
case
you
cannot
have
an
innocent
dupe
principal.
he
must
receive
a
fee
compensation
or
reward
for
his
job.
and
when
we
get
to
the
charge
in
this
case
i
wanted
to
show
you
that
under
count
8
of
the
indictment
we
are
charged
with
giving
cyril
niederberger
a
trip.
the
audit
of
the
'69
and
'70
tax
returns
and
an
investigation
conducted
of
gulf
oil
corporation's
political
contributions
and
a
submission
of
an
investigative
memorandum
of
march
28,
1974.
that
has
been
called
the
bahamas
x
report
throughout
the
proceedings.
i
wanted
to
show
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
had
a
special
post-watergate
investigative
body
with
a
special
prosecutor.
i
wanted
to
show
that
the
intelligence
branch
of
the
internal
revenue
service
investigated
that
report.
i
offered,
and
the
offer
is
in
my
brief,
and
cited
to
show
those,
to
show
that
the
niederberger
report
as
submitted
march
28,
1978
was
an
accurate
report.
the
irs
declined
criminal
prosecution
of
gulf
oil.
i
wanted
and
did
show
that
gulf
oil
had
paid
over
$150
million
in
additional
taxes
for
the
audits
of
which
niederberger
was
the
large
case
manager.
every
trip
of
which
the
golf
trip
was
taken
after
the
government
said
the
report
was
filed.
so
under
these
facts
you
have
to
go
to
the
fact
that
the
government
is
trying
to
prove
a
reward.
now,
if
they
are
trying
to
prove
a
reward,
why
would
or
at
least
can't
a
jury
and
shouldn't
a
jury
have
the
chance
to
decide
if
the
reports
take
proper,
if
gulf
paid
$150
million
in
taxes,
couldn't
a
jury
take
as
a
fact
that
in
the
consideration
in
deciding
the
factual
issue
of
whether
it
is
a
fee
compensation
or
reward
or
under
201(f)
it
is
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
duty
performed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
because
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
judge
said,
"oh,
you
mean
because
the
bribe
didn't
take."
all
through
this
trial
i
wasn't
trying
a
bribe
case,
you
understand,
because
then
it
would
have
been
admissible.
but
his
remark
to
me
was,
"well,
if
the
bribe
didn't
take
you
mean
the
man
isn't
guilty."
the
fact
is
in
this
case
the
jury
could
consider
since
the
golf
trips
took
place
after
the
report
was
filed,
months
after,
would
an
intelligent
person
offer
a
fee
compensation
or
reward
when
his
company
is
getting
socked
with
$150
million
worth
of
taxes,
or
at
least
isn't
it
a
jury
question?
that
is
the
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
