just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
in
your
separate
accounting
how
did
you
allocate
the
costs
of
your
central
office
to
operations
in
wisconsin?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
are
suggesting
the
other
side
shouldn't
say
a
word
because
you
are
saying
that
they
may
not
say
that
this
so-called
income
that
is
admittedly
earned
outside
the
state,
none
of
it
was
earned
in
wisconsin
and
yet
they
are
taxing
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
i
suppose
they
could
say
that
this
is
unitary
business
and
the
way
to
find
out
where
income
is
earned
is
to
apply
the
state
formula.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
your
approach
is
just
a
way
to
say
the
formula
is
inaccurate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
may
be
so
but
i
guess
in
this
case
it
is
just
by
the
accident
of
legal
entity
and
ownership
that
you
can
treat
it
altogether.
i
suppose
if
all
of
exxon's
production
was
owned
by
a
separate
company,
an
independent
company,
and
its
refining
was
owned
by
an
independent
company,
and
its
marketing
by
an
independent
company,
there
wasn't
common
ownership
but
they
did
business
in
the
same
way,
there
was
the
same
flow
of
oil
from
well
to
refinery
to
marketing,
it
would
be
--
economically
it
would
be
the
same
operation,
but
you
certainly
couldn't
treat
it
as
a
unitary
business.
