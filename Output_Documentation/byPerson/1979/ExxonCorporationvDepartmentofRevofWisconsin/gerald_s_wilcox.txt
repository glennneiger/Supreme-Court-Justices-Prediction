mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellees
here
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
what
has
been
already
said
in
butler
brothers.
exxon
in
the
instant
case
has
not
challenged
the
wisconsin
formula.
it
has
challenged
the
right
of
wisconsin
to
apply
its
three-factor
formula
to
some
of
its
business
income.
one
of
the
terms
used
is
situs
income.
now,
the
unitary
approach,
the
three-factor
unitary
method
takes
into
consideration
situs
income.
all
three
of
the
denominators
are
based
on
situs.
the
income
that
appellant
is
talking
about
as
situs
income
is
income
from
a
unitary
business.
now,
a
unitary
business
is
by
definition
a
single,
one
business.
income
from
such
businesses
cannot
be
attributed
to
it
in
part,
it
cannot
be
attributed
to
parts
or
to
part.
the
basis
of
the
unitary
concept
is
that
income
cannot
be
a
function
of
any
given
factor,
but
it
is
a
function
of
the
business.
situs
is
taken
into
consideration
by
wisconsin
and
by
40
other
states
who
have
adopted
a
similar
three-factor
formula.
the
basis
for
the
formula
essentially
is
an
attempt
by
the
states
to
find
a
reasonable
formula
in
which
to
tax
large
multi-state
unitary
businesses
in
a
uniform
and
equitable
manner.
i
believe
that
this
formula
that
wisconsin
has
adopted
and
that
several,
forty-some
other
states
have
adopted
does
just
that.
wisconsin
is
not
taxing
extraterritorial
income.
wisconsin
has
never
admitted
that
these
figures
shown
by
the
appellant
proves
that
it
is
taxing
extraterritorial
income.
we
are
not
disputing
a
separate
functional
accounting
or
whatever
they
want
to
call
it
for
their
own
business
purposes,
but
they
have
no
income
from
exploration
and
production
unless
this
court
is
going
to
go
back
to
the
imputed
income
theory.
the
income
is
the
income
from
their
total
unitary
business.
wisconsin
applied
its
formula,
it
taxed
1/500th
of
that
income.
i
do
not
believe
that
under
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
do
you
mean
could
we
adopt
a
system
where
we
tax
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
that
is
interesting,
if
the
states
took
that
approach
--
and
i
assume
that
some
will,
because
they
find
it
advantageous
--
that
could
result
if
the
corporation
has
a
net
loss
under
that
reasoning,
some
states
could
say
well,
you
may
have
had
a
total
loss
nationwide,
but
you
don't
have
a
loss
here,
you've
got
income
here
because
exploration
and
production
or
whatever
it
might
be,
refining,
produces
income,
what
we
would
have
is
we
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
think
some
states
may
have
tried
separate
accounting
themselves.
i
know
in
one
case
california
did
and
their
own
supreme
court
rejected
it.
so
i
can't
say
that
no
state
would
attempt
separate
accounting
if
that
might
prove
advantageous.
i
think
it
is
inconsistent,
but
i
can't
say
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
if
that
is
where
all
their
income
is,
i
think
it
is
in
other
states,
but
i
don't
believe
those
states
generally
do
tax
it.
but
yes,
you're
right,
they
might
prefer
to
tax
that
way.
i
don't
think
they
should.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
that
is
possible.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
think
one
of
the
basic
points
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
wisconsin
does
have
a
three-factor
formula.
now,
during
the
period
there
was
one
little
discrepancy
between
some
of
the
states.
we
had
the
cost
of
manufacturing
rather
than
payroll,
but
essentially
it
meant
the
same
thing
and
the
enumerator
in
that
case
was
zero,
so
exxon
only
came
out
ahead
if
anything
on
that.
but
essentially
it
is
uniform.
and
going
back
to
adams
express
and
going
through
butler
brothers,
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
difficult
to
tax
multi-state
unitary
businesses.
i
am
not
here
to
suggest
anything
else.
i
am
suggesting
there
has
been
an
approach
adopted
by
most
of
the
authorities,
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
approach.
it
has
been
adopted
by
wisconsin
and,
like
i
said,
forty-some
other
states.
that
alone
is
designed
to
prevent
duplicate
taxation.
it
is
also
designed
to
tax
if
we
have
the
perfect
formula
no
more
than
100
percent.
it
is
designed
to
tax
exactly
that
and
no
more.
unfortunately,
a
lot
of
the
states,
including
wisconsin,
exclude
certain
income,
so
i
don't
even
think
it
ever
would.
now,
you
can
constantly
attack
such
a
formula
by
stating,
well,
if
wisconsin
had
put
in
payroll
some
false
figures,
they
obviously
can
attack
that
formula
on
that
basis.
but
to
attack
the
three-factor
formula
in
a
unitary
approach
through
the
use
of
separate
accounting
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
a
lot
of
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
i
think
that
is
part
of
appellant's
argument.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
think
you
do
have
to
determine
what
is
included
in
a
unitary
business,
and
i
guess
in
one
of
the
briefs
filed
by
one
of
the
amicus
has
indicated
that
exxon
is
not
a
unitary
business
in
this
area.
i
don't
know
what
is.
it
has
been
said
that
a
unitary
business
involves
a
series
of
transactions,
and
i
think
in
this
case
you
have
the
typical
unitary
business
where
you
have
got
the
flow
of
goods,
you
start
at
exploration
and
production,
you
move
to
refining,
you
end
up
with
the
final
product
being
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
not
wisconsin,
not
under
wisconsin
law.
i
guess
i
would
dispute
the
economic
conclusion.
i
think
that
the
determination
to
be
a
corporate
structure,
under
one
corporate
structure
--
and
i
don't
know
why
exxon
decided
to
be
under
one
corporate
structure,
rather
than
three
or
more
--
i
think
that
is
a
very
basic
determination
from
a
business
standpoint.
i
assume
they
have
a
good
business
reason
for
doing
it.
obviously
you
can
share
costs,
administrative
costs,
you
can
share
supply
costs.
in
their
determination,
they
came
out
with
the
determination
that
the
supply
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
wisconsin
would
not
treat
as
a
unitary
business
if
there
is
more
than
one
corporate
structure.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
in
other
words,
we
stay
within
the
corporate
structure.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
constitutionally
we
have
to,
but
we
do
under
the
statute.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
we
didn't
force
them
to
incorporate
as
they
did,
no.
i
guess
as
i
have
indicated,
to
suggest
that
a
business
is
unitary
and
then
permit
the
corporation,
a
unitary
corporation
to
come
forth
and
assign
certain
of
its
income
to
particular
departments
is
a
contradiction.
what
you
have
is
saying
we've
got
a
single
business
--
that
is
what
unitary
means
--
and
now
we
come
back
and
say
well,
you
can
break
it
down
in
parts,
you
have
a
very
difficult
problem
of
attributing
income
and
that
is
where
the
unitary
business
concept
was
conceived.
i
submit
that
to
allow
separate
accounting
after
there
has
been
a
determination
as
to
unitary
business,
to
impeach
or
to
break
down
that
business
would
mean
that
the
states
would
literally
start
over
to
try
to
find
a
reasonable
way
to
tax
these
large
multistate
corporations.
i
don't
think
that
would
benefit
either
the
corporations
or
the
states.
the
finale
point
i
really
have
to
make
is
the
one
that
was
stressed
continually
and
apparently
the
one
that
the
reply
brief
and
the
appellant
has
finally
hung
its
hat
on,
is
the
concept
of
situs.
this
income,
the
separate
income
that
they
talk
about
--
which,
by
the
way,
under
their
figures
is
three-fourths
of
their
income
--
should
belong
in
a
particular
place,
and
the
appellee
does
not
agree
with
that.
the
comments
as
to
what
the
appellee
has
conceded,
i
will
not
get
into,
but
we
do
not
concede
that.
it
is
income
from
the
unitary
business.
the
situs
factor
is
in
all
formulas,
it
is
in
a
denominator.
its
situs
factor
deals
with
property,
you
can
determine
what
property
is,
you
can
determine
what
payroll
is,
and
you
can
determine
where
sales
is.
these
factors
are
considered,
they
are
then
used
to
apportion
the
income
which
you
cannot
place
in
a
particular
spot.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
we
are
not
a
member
of
the
multistate
tax
commission.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
i
can't
answer
that
for
sure.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
anything
present.
there
has
obviously
been
several
attempts
in
this
direction
with
limited
degree
of
success.
i
am
aware
of
that.
but
right
now
i
can't
tell
you
what
is
going
on.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
don't
think
the
statute
prevents
that.
i
think
that
would
be
inconsistent.
wisconsin
never
treated
the
market
separate.
initially,
what
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
what
initially
happened
is
exxon
filed
tax
returns
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
oh,
you
mean
the
tax
appeals
commission.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
okay.
the
department
of
revenue,
my
client,
did
not.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
initially,
yes,
they
did
divide
up
exxon
into
essentially
three
unitary
businesses.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
you
are
saying
that
we
might
not
have
appealed?
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
think
that
might
be
true.
i
don't
think
that
would
have
been
right,
but
that
might
have
been
true,
yes.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
here
to
suggest
that
all
states,
any
more
than
all
corporations,
act
consistently
when
they
see
that
another
approach
would
be
more
advantageous
from
a
financial
position.
i
think
they
should
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
the
fact
that
in
butler
brothers
--
and
i
think
really
in
moorman,
moorman
had
a
single
factor
formula
which
obviously
gave
the
court
difficulty.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
i
would
hope
that
we
would
not
have
to
wait
for
that,
frankly.
there
are
all
kinds
of
methods
one
can
pick,
all
kinds
of
approaches,
but
we
do
have
i
think
a
sense
of
uniformity
now,
more
than
we
have
had
before.
now,
it
is
not
perfect
but
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
again
i
haven't
dealt
too
in
depth
on
whether
exxon
is
a
unitary
business,
i
think
the
record
does
support
it.
i
have
dealt
in
depth
in
my
brief
on
that.
i
guess
the
reason
i
haven't
is
i
believe
the
appellant's
reply
brief
sort
of
suggests
that
that
is
not
the
approach
they
are
taking,
i
realize
they
still
leave
that
open.
but
i
believe
that
exxon
is
a
unitary
business.
there
may
be
a
business
under
one
corporate
veil
that,
you
know,
is
not
unitary.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
essentially,
yes,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
properly
applied.
i'm
not
saying,
as
suggested
by
the
appellant,
that
there
is
no
way
to
challenge
the
application
of
the
three-factor
formula.
there
are
i
mean
you
can
show
we
put
in
our
formula
things
we
should
not
have.
we
did
in
fact
not
include
the
right
property,
for
instance.
those
factors,
property,
sales
and
payroll,
can
be
essentially
fairly
easy
to
determine
on
a
situs
basis.
now,
there
is
difficulty.
there
is
no
perfection
there,
but
i
think
essentially
they
can
be
determined.
income
cannot
be.
i
think
that
has
been
recognized
and
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
conclusion.
income
cannot
be
assigned
to
a
particular
function.
big,
large
businesses,
and
even
small
businesses
--
income
--
and
the
court
has
said
this
in
other
cases
--
only
ends
up
from
the
final
product
sales,
but
you
cannot
attribute
it
only
to
sales.
it
results
not
just
from
the
three
factors
used,
although
those
are
the
three
income
producones.
it
results
from
the
total
business,
including
administrative
costs,
supply
costs,
what
have
you,
but
you
cannot
break
it
down.
if
you
could
or
if
we
say
you
can,
there
will
be
no
end
to
separate
accounting.
i
know
what
accounting
can
do
and
i
know
what
it
cannot
do.
there
were
value
judgments
in
this
accounting.
i
take
them
to
be
good
business
value
judgments,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
subject
or
you
can
tax
corporations
based
upon
their
separate
accounting
analysis
or
separate
functional
accounting.
financial
accounting
and
tax
accounting
do
not
coincide.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
not
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
we
can't
and
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
there
is
at
least
a
sale
there,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
but
you
do
have
separate
corporations,
you
have
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
they
said
they
have.
they
have
called
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
guess
i
wouldn't
use
the
term
nonsense,
but
i
would
answer
yes,
i
do
believe
it
better
allocates
income
because
of
the
judgments
--
and
i
think
they
may
be
reasonable
business
judgments
--
but
what
you
have,
just
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
let's
assume
that,
okay,
by
separate
accounting
this
is
possible.
well,
what
you
have
then
is
that
somehow
some
state
is
then
going
to
be
able
to
tax
supposedly
the
separate
business
called
exploration
and
production,
but
they
will
be
taking
it,
if
there
is
a
single
corporation,
on
computed
income.
i
can
imagine
exxon's
objection
to
that.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
they
said
it
is
based
upon
pratt's
oil
gram
and
they
claim
there
is
no
negotiation,
but
i
just
--
in
the
oil
industry,
to
suggest
that
this
type
of
price
is
one
that
tax
authorities
have
to
accept,
i
just
can't
conceive
of
how
it
would
work.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
think
the
statements
about
what
we
conceded,
right
from
the
beginning
those
figures
were
objected
to
as
irrelevant.
we
did
not
admit
to
the
validity
of
those
posted
fuel
prices
to
the
extent
that
they
compared
to
price
factors
sold
to
third
parties.
i
still
object
to
it
because
the
fact
is
the
oil
wasn't
sold.
if
all
that
oil
was
sold,
they
would
not
have
had
the
crude
oil
for
their
own
refineries.
now,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
reason
they
operated
as
a
single
corporate
structure
was
because
it
does
spread
the
risk,
they
have
supply
for
their
refineries.
they
were
able
to
have
enough
crude
oil
so
that
70
percent
of
their
refining
capacity
would
be
available
by
their
own
use
of
the
crude.
now,
had
they
sold
it
all
out,
the
price
would
have
obviously
been
different.
it
would
have
probably
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
no,
i
think
you've
analyzed
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
essentially
correct.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
they
did
find
on
separate
accounting,
i
will
be
honest.
it
is
clear
to
me
that
right
through
all
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
okay.
there
are
two
approaches.
now,
the
butlers
brothers
indicated
in
that
decision
that
separate
accounting
may
be
fine
for
business
purposes.
i
stick
with
that.
i
think
it
may
be
very
good.
it
may
be
absolutely
necessary.
but
this
is
a
tax
case.
now,
i
do
believe
separate
accounting
may
be
used
for
certain
purposes.
it
might
be
used
to
show
that
the
formula
over-extended.
that
would
then
mean
that
you
would
have
to
change
your
formula.
i
do
not
believe
it
can
ever
be
used
to
determine
how
a
state
is
going
to
tax,
but
i
think
if
you
have
a
valid
formula
to
start
with,
and
we
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
again,
integrity
in
accounting,
i'm
not
challenging
it
for
the
business
purpose
but
i
am
for
tax
purposes
and
i
think
you
have
--
that
is
the
question,
and
i
think
if
the
unitary
concept
has
meaning
then
you
don't
have
separate
accounting
to
start
over
again
and
break
apart
what
you've
put
together.
i
think
that
the
separate
accounting,
as
the
appellant
claims
it
proves,
does
not
prove
that
here
at
all.
it
does
not
prove
that
wisconsin
over-reached.
it
does
not
prove
that
wisconsin
is
taxing
things
out
of
all
rational
relationship.
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
i
don't
believe
i
accept
their
figures
would
be
the
same
if
they
were
three
independent
corporations.
i
certainly
don't,
because
it
would
--
mr.
gerald
s.
wilcox
but
i
don't
think
that
follows
that
they
said
they
would
be
the
same
if
they
were
three
independent
corporations,
because
i
don't
believe
they
would.
you
have
one
corporation
with
different
administrative
expenses
because
of
that,
i
would
assume.
but
no,
i
think
if
you
had
three
independent
corporations,
you
may
sell
to
each
other
but
there
are
different
restrictions
on
how
profit
is
divided
up.
i
don't
concede
that.
i
thank
you.
