mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
reversed
a
lower
court
decision
that
had
excluded
from
wisconsin
taxation
the
income
of
appellant's
expiration
and
production
department
earned
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
basic
issue
here,
as
asserted
by
the
appellee,
is
whether
a
vertically
integrated
multistate
corporation
can
be
automatically
characterized
as
unitary
and
automatically
required
thereby
to
subject
its
total
corporate
income
to
apportionment
even
though
the
taxpayer
can
conclusively
identify
and
accurately
measure
its
exploration
and
production
income
at
its
situs
origin
outside
the
state.
now,
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
appellant,
the
appellee
asserts
that
once
a
taxpayer
is
determined
to
be
unitary
and
engages
in
any
activities
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
then
virtually
all
its
corporate
income
is
subject
to
apportionment
by
wisconsin
and
the
taxpayer
is
not
permitted
to
prove
extraterritorial
taxation
by
establishing
either
that
the
income
was
derived
from
sources
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin
or
that
the
quantity
of
income
attributable
to
wisconsin
is
out
of
all
appropriate
proportion
to
the
activities
of
the
taxpayer
in
wisconsin.
now,
whether
or
not
appellant
is
found
to
be
unitary
is
not
the
basic
issue.
appellant
does
not
concede
that
it
is
a
single
unitary
business,
but
even
assuming
arguendo
that
it
is
unitary,
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution
permit
imposition
of
the
unitary
per
se
approach
with
full
apportionment,
regardless
of
unrefuted
proof
that
the
result
is
to
tax
situs
income
derived
and
accurately
measured
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin.
appellant's
position
here
involves
a
two-step
analysis.
first,
as
to
what
are
the
constitutional
principles
previously
defined
by
this
court
to
limit
state
taxation
of
extraterritorial
income
and,
second,
as
to
whether
the
appellant's
proof
in
the
record
here
satisfies
the
burden
of
proof
as
defined
by
this
court
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation.
the
leading
decisions
of
this
court
on
apportionment
are
the
hans
rees
case
decided
in
1931,
bass,
ratcliff
decided
in
1924,
butler
brothers
in
1942,
and
more
recently
moorman
manufacturing
company
decided
in
1978.
all
of
these
cases
are
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
a
taxpayer
does
have
and
in
fact
must
have
the
right
--
must
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
the
unconstitutionality
of
an
apportionment
assessment
by
establishing
a
taxation
of
extraterritorial
income.
in
hans
rees,
the
issue
was
not
whether
the
taxpayer
was
unitary,
which
was
assumed
by
this
court.
the
real
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
assessment
there
taxed
income
which
was
earned
outside
the
state
of
north
carolina.
this
court
found
a
due
process
violation
based
upon
the
taxpayer's
proof
that
the
income
attributable
to
north
carolina
was
out
of
all
appropriate
proportion
to
the
activities
of
the
taxpayer
in
that
state
thus
hans
rees
met
its
burden
of
proving
extraterritorial
taxation.
this
decision
was
consistent
with
the
prior
bass,
ratcliff
case,
only
there
the
taxpayer's
proof
did
not
establish
that
new
york
was
taxing
income
not
earned
in
that
state.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
was
found
to
be
a
so-called
unitary
business,
this
court
nevertheless
examined
the
record
for
proof
of
extraterritorial
taxation,
but
found
such
proof
to
be
lacking.
butler
brothers
involved
a
similar
analysis
as
to
a
unitary
business.
this
court
decision
notes
that
the
taxpayer
failed
to
prove
that
the
apportionment
formula
there
attributed
to
california
for
taxation
income
which
was
earned
elsewhere
by
not
showing
that
the
factors
responsible
for
the
income
were
present
in
other
states
but
were
not
present
in
california
thus,
butler
brothers
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof.
finally,
in
moorman,
this
court
only
commented
on
the
so-called
unitary
concept
in
a
footnote
but
did
analyze
the
record
and
found
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
show
that
a
significant
portion
of
its
income
being
taxed
by
iowa
was
in
fact
generated
outside
the
state.
the
majority
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stevens
notes
the
lack
of
"any
separate
accounting
analysis"
showing
what
portion
of
moorman's
profits
were
attributable
to
sales,
to
manufacturing,
or
to
other
portions
of
the
taxpayer's
operations,
and
the
opinion
expressly
suggests
that
it
should
not
be
impossible
for
a
unitary
corporation
to
prove
its
actual
income
from
activities
in
a
particular
state.
now,
we
should
note
parenthetically
here
that
neither
bass,
ratcliff,
butler
brothers
nor
moorman
involved
situs
income
which
was
geographically
located
and
accurately
measured
outside
the
taxing
state,
but
that
the
fact
situation
here
presents
such
a
record
for
perhaps
the
first
time
for
the
court
to
deal
with
tangible
situs
income
derived
from
natural
resources.
thus,
the
law
as
previously
decided
by
this
court
expressly
recognizes
that
a
taxpayer
contesting
an
assessment
under
an
apportionment
cormula
must
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
extraterritorial
taxation
even
though
deemed
to
be
a
unitary
business.
as
a
consequence,
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
consistently
treated
unitary
as
a
possible
condition
precedent
to
the
application
of
an
apportionment
formula,
but
has
simultaneously
made
clear
that
the
factual
issue
of
unitary
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
extraterritorial
taxation
and
to
the
proof
thereof.
moreover,
until
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
which
is
here
before
you
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
if
the
taxpayer
wasn't
unitary,
you
wouldn't
meet
the
condition
precedent
and
you
wouldn't
even
get
to
the
analysis
of
extraterritorial
taxation.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
we
would
be
here
as
we
are
now,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
we
would
be
saying
that
you
were
reaching
outside
the
state
to
tax
extraterritorial
income.
now,
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
--
until
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
here,
it
seemed
apparent
that
the
wisconsin
statute
involved
was
consistent
with
the
proof
prescription
contained
in
these
four
decisions
i
have
just
mentioned.
our
section
7107
specifies
that
a
corporation
engaged
in
business
within
and
without
the
state
shall
be
taxed
only
on
such
income
as
is
derived
from
business
transacted
or
property
located
within
the
state.
but
here
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
dismissed
appellant's
unrefuted
separate
functional
accounting
proof
of
income
earned
outside
the
state
by
labeling
as
dicta
this
court's
prescription
in
the
moorman
decision
for
proving
extraterritorial
taxation
by
separate
accounting
analysis.
thus,
the
wisconsin
court
refused
to
consider
our
proof
and
adopted
its
unitary
per
se
approach
which
clearly
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
under
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
there
are
two
types
of
separate
accounting
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
was
separate
geographical
wisconsin
accounting,
but
the
separate
accounting
that
we
are
really
relying
on
here
was
the
separate
functional
accounting
of
the
taxpayer's
three
main
functional
operating
departments,
exploration
and
production,
refining
and
marketing.
now,
only
the
marketing
department
engaged
in
any
activities
in
wisconsin,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
these
three
departments
were
organized
and
operated
as
separate
segments
and
separate
functional
operations
and
this
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
wisconsin
circuit
court
on
the
first
level
of
appeal.
now,
the
trial
court
also
found
that
the
taxpayer
used
internal
transfer
prices
between
its
functional
departments
that
were
the
equivalent
to
third-party
competitive
prices.
now,
that
finding
of
fact
was
not
even
appealed
by
the
state,
were
not
even
challenged
by
the
state
on
appeal.
the
trial
court
further
found
that
the
income
of
each
of
appellant's
functional
operating
departments
could
be
determined
from
its
books
and
records
without
resort
to
actual
third-party
sales.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
am
trying
to
get
to
that,
but
i
wanted
to
give
you
the
background
of
the
facts
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
finding
of
fact
that
the
accounting
for
the
functional
departments
could
be
determined
from
the
taxpayer's
books
and
records
also
was
not
appealed,
not
challenged
on
appeal.
now,
the
fact
that
these
two
findings
were
not
challenged
means
that
the
appellee
has
conceded
the
validity
and
the
accounting
integrity
of
the
determination
of
the
exploration
and
production
department
net
income.
now,
that
is
a
long
way
around
to
answer
your
question,
but
i
felt
the
background
was
necessary.
the
central
office
charges
were
allocated
on
the
basis
of
similar
to
a
cost
of
service
arrangement
with
the
various
functional
departments,
and
again
this
was
not
challenged
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
separate
functional
accounting
for
each
of
these
operating
departments,
including
particularly
the
exploration
and
production
department,
stands
unrefuted
and
unchallenged
in
the
record.
so
that
issue
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
perhaps
not
in
every
case,
but
certainly
where
a
factual
record
is
made
that
demonstrates
conclusively
that
the
income
being
taxed
by
a
state
is
extraterritorial,
then
whether
or
not
the
taxpayer
is
unitary
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
that
would
be
our
argument.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
that
is
what
the
trial
court
determined
and
we
are
well
satisfied
with
that
decision,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
didn't
agree
with
us
on
much
of
anything
and
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
the
position
of
the
appellee
would
be
--
and
perhaps
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
--
would
be
that
you
lock-step
yourself
into
and
if
you
have
any
activities
in
the
state,
then
your
total
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
to
be
very
honest,
mr.
justice
white,
i
can't
say
that
i
know
what
unitary
means
because
it
is
used
in
so
many
inconsistent
ways.
it
is
not
a
precise
term
certainly
in
the
cases
around
the
country.
it
is
not
a
form
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
that
is
the
position
of
the
appellee,
as
i
understand
it,
and
our
position
is
that
that
is
--
that
unitary
is
a
superfluous
concept
and
that
you
must
look
to
the
underlying
constitutional
principles
of
both
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause
to
determine
whether
a
particular
activity
can
be
apportioned.
the
test
applied
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
determine
what
is
unitary
begs
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
particular
activity
has
any
rational
relationship
to
the
activities
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
would
authorize
the
state
without
violating
due
process
to
tax
that
activity.
and
we
assert
here
that
the
exploration
and
production
income
which
was
generated
entirely
outside
the
state,
which
could
be
identified
at
its
geographical
location,
which
could
be
accurately
measured
there,
and
the
measurement
has
not
even
been
challenged,
that
this
demonstrates
that
that
exploration
and
production
income
is
extraterritorial,
it
has
no
relation
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
in
fact,
we
have
findings
of
fact
in
the
trial
court
that
--
those
that
i
have
already
cited
--
indicating
that
the
exploration
and
production
and
the
refining
net
income
had
no
integral
relationship
with
the
marketing
activities
that
were
carried
on
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
i
can't
speak
for
corporations
generally,
your
honor,
but
my
perception
and
my
understanding
is
that
each
of
those,
if
the
proof
is
proper,
can
be
identified
as
separate
unitary
businesses
and
only
those
businesses
who
have
material
activities
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
could
be
apportioned.
in
other
words
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
am
saying
that
one
of
our
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
--
due
process
arguments
is
that
each
functional
department
can
be
treated
as
a
separate
unitary
business.
but
whether
or
not
it
is
treated
as
unitary,
the
root
question
is
whether
the
constitutional
principles,
particularly
the
rational
relationship
principle
permits
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
reach
out
and
tax
income
that
the
record
conclusively
establishes
was
derived
outside
the
state.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
my
belief
is
all
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
not
if
every
state
had
identical
definitions
and
identical
formulas,
but
clearly
that
is
not
the
case.
while
something
like
44
states
have
three-factor
formulas,
wisconsin
being
one
of
them,
the
definitions
and
the
manner
of
application
may
differ
from
state
to
state
such
that
there
is
no
uniformity.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
guess
if
every
state
apportioned
in
an
identical
manner,
you
wouldn't
have
the
argument
perhaps
under
due
process,
but
you
would
still
have
the
argument
that
if
the
situs
state
where
the
oil
well
is
located
had
the
power
to
tax
all
of
the
income
from
that
oil
well,
and
other
states
in
addition
were
apportioning
that
income
from
the
oil
well,
that
you
would
still
have
a
commerce
clause
argument
because
of
the
burden
of
multiple
taxation.
so
i
don't
think
that
even
a
uniform,
entirely
uniform
apportionment
formula
resolves
the
commerce
clause
question
based
upon
the
situs
income
which
is
here
before
the
court
now,
the
situs
income
derived
from
natural
resources.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
my
position
is
that
it
does,
your
honor.
the
record
shows
that
the
wisconsin
assessment
here
in
issue
attributed
to
wisconsin
income
out
of
all
appropriate
proportion
to
the
taxpayer's
activities
in
wisconsin
which,
as
you
will
recall,
were
only
marketing.
one
of
the
exhibits
in
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
appellee
has
attributed
to
these
wisconsin
marketing
operations
income
at
a
rate
equal
to
approximately
two
and
a
half
times
the
rate
actually
earned
by
the
entire
marketing
function.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
record
does
not
show
the
actuality
of
multiple
taxation
in
actual
numbers.
the
record
does
show
the
geographical
locations
where
the
exploration
and
production
activities
are
conducted,
which
are
all
outside
wisconsin,
and
the
record
shows
the
wisconsin
income
with
and
without
the
inclusion
of
the
exploration
and
production
income,
apportionable
income
which
thereby
pinpoints
the
amount
of
approximately
$2.6
million
of
exploration
and
production
income
which
was
attributed
to
wisconsin
under
the
assessment
in
issue.
now
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
wisconsin
has
a
statute,
part
of
this
statute
in
issue
that
says
the
income
from
any
farm,
mine
or
quarry
shall
be
allocable
and
not
apportionable.
now,
the
appellee
conceded
on
the
record
that
oil
and
gas
extraction
is
mining
for
that
purpose.
in
fact,
the
appellee
conceded
that
the
principle
of
situs
income
by
allocating
the
sales
at
the
wellhead
to
third
parties
and
not
apportioning
it,
but
by
contending
that
all
the
rest
of
the
exploration
and
production
income
is
apportionable,
the
appellee
both
invokes
the
multiple
taxation
doctrine,
because
the
situs
income
is
subject
to
the
power
of
tax
outside
the
state,
and
it
also
provides
the
basis
for
a
due
process
violation
because
of
ignoring
the
rational
relationship
requirement
between
that
exploration
and
production
income
and
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
not,
although
they
were
excluded
by
something
the
record
calls
a
barrel
formula
which
is
an
extremely
complex
and
an
arbitrary
method
of
dividing
the
apportionable
property
from
the
non-apportionable
property
and
the
apportionable
payroll
from
the
non-apportionable
payroll.
the
record
will
show
admissions
by
the
witnesses
for
the
department
of
revenue
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
separation.
in
fact,
sales
percentages
were
used
to
make
part
of
the
adjustment
here
in
issue,
part
of
the
formula,
which
have
no
real
bearing
on
how
much
property
or
how
much
payroll
was
involved.
but
if
the
court
wants
to
slug
its
way
through
that
barrel
formula
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
there
was
an
issue
below
and
in
fact
part
of
that
issue
was
remanded,
but
that
is
not
before
the
court.
what
we
brought
here
is
the
basic
constitutional
questions
of
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause.
i
would
next
like
to
talk
about
the
line
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
identification
and
accurate
measurement
of
extraterritorial
income
subjected
to
apportionment
by
a
non-situs
state
shows
the
risk
or
burden
of
multiple
state
taxation
which
thereby
invokes
this
multiple
taxation
doctrine
because
the
situs
states
unquestionably
have
the
power
to
tax
that
income.
now,
the
appellee
asserts
that
the
moorman
decision
abandons
the
multiple
taxation
doctrine,
but
i
assert
that
decision
does
not
so
hold
and
that,
rather
than
having
abandoned
that
long-established
doctrine,
moorman
merely
found
the
taxpayer
there
unable
to
invoke
it
because
of
a
failure
to
prove
the
source
or
location
of
its
income.
i
believe
the
language
of
the
court
was
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
meet
the
factual
predicate.
well,
that
factual
predicate
i
understand
to
mean
that
proof
is
required
as
to
the
situs
where
the
income
was
derived
but
not
proof
that
it
had
actually
been
taxed
at
that
situs.
now,
if
the
doctrine
were
to
be
abandoned
by
requiring
the
actuality
of
multiple
taxation,
then
that
would
turn
state
taxation
into
a
foot
race
with
the
swiftest
state
to
tax
a
particular
activity
declared
the
winner,
and
i
can't
think
of
a
less
desirable
situation.
i
have
mentioned
several
of
the
items
in
the
factual
record
and,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
am
going
to
pass
on
with
those.
those
are
very
carefully
laid
out
in
our
brief.
i
want
to
mention
one,
however,
that
the
trial
court
did
find
as
a
fact
that
the
wisconsin
taxation
of
the
appellant's
exploration
and
production
and
its
refining
net
income
subjected
the
appellant
to
multiple
state
taxation
on
such
income.
and
on
appeal
at
the
first
level
in
the
wisconsin
circuit
court,
this
finding
of
multiple
state
taxation
was
affirmed.
however,
that
was
subsequently
reversed,
along
with
the
finding
of
three
unitary
businesses
when
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
took
its
unitary
per
se
approach.
now,
the
factual
basis
for
the
findings
of
fact
are
unrefuted
in
the
record,
particularly
those
findings
of
fact
that
were
reversed
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
finding
of
three
unitary
businesses
was
reversed
as
a
matter
of
law
without
consideration
of
the
facts.
but
the
factual
record
here
specifically
identifies
by
separate
functional
accounting
the
undisputed
income
of
the
exploration
and
production
function
which
was
earned
entirely
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
record
shows
the
geographical
locations
and
it
shows
the
$2.6
million
worth
of
exploration
and
production
income
which
is
included
in
the
wisconsin
assessment,
and
all
of
this
income
was
subject
to
being
taxed
in
the
states
of
its
origin.
now,
this
clearly
supports
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
that
the
assessment
at
issue
subjected
the
appellant
to
multiple
state
taxation.
now,
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
well,
the
years
in
issue
here
were
1965
through
1968,
so
i
am
not
aware
of
any
windfall
profits
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
anything
like
that.
my
personal
answer
to
the
question,
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
would
have
to
qualify
it
in
attempting
to
answer
your
question,
would
be
that
windfall
profits
might
--
if
that
is
an
appropriate
term,
and
i
guess
i
am
not
willing
to
accept
the
term
--
but
large
profits
might
be
measured
from
the
exploration
and
production
department,
where
the
exploration
and
production
was
done
in
the
1920's
at
the
1920
level
of
prices,
and
the
sales
of
the
oil
and
gas
are
done
at
today's
prices,
you
are
going
to
show
a
large
gross
profit
on
such
sales
which
somebody
might
call
a
windfall
profit.
but
when
you
consider
the
replacement
costs
of
those
reserves,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
think
of
that
as
a
windfall.
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
the
issue,
the
integrity
of
the
determination
of
the
exploration
and
production
income
is
not
at
issue
and
the
appellee
should
not
be
heard
to
dispute
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
the
correct
amount
of
the
exploration
and
production
income,
nor
should
the
appellee
be
allowed
to
dispute
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
that
income
was
earned
entirely
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin,
nor
the
fact
that
the
assessment
in
issue
includes
a
significant
portion
of
that
income.
thus,
based
upon
the
proof
from
the
court's
prescription
for
finding
extraterritorial
taxation,
i
respectfully
submit
that
these
facts
must
invalidate
the
assessment,
and
i
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
be
reversed
on
the
basis
that
section
7107
of
the
wisconsin
statutes
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
here
by
the
appellee
to
tax
the
exploration
and
production
net
income
earned
outside
the
state,
and
that
such
application
constitutes
a
violation
of
both
the
due
process
and
the
commerce
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
they
are
taxing
it,
your
honor,
and
they
have
not
even
challenged
on
appeal
the
determination
of
that
income.
and
having
established
in
the
record
where
that
income
was
earned
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
earned
in
wisconsin,
we
feel
that
we
have
established
the
extraterritorial
nature
of
that
income
and
established
that
the
assessment
here
constitutes
extraterritorial
taxation.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
but
the
unitary
approach
is
just
a
rationalization
then
for
the
state
to
tax
extraterritorial
income
and
it
doesn't
get
at
the
root
constitutional
issues
and
those
issues
are
whether
there
is
a
rational
relationship
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
formula
as
applied
here
results
in
the
taxation
of
extraterritorial
income,
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
believe
i
have
a
minute
or
two
left.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
perhaps
i
can
shed
a
little
further
light
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
wilcox
had,
but
first
i
would
point
out
that
as
i
understand
mr.
wilcox's
argument,
he
still
really
hasn't
reached
the
constitutional
principles.
he
is
dealing
with
this
illusive,
ill-defined
concept
of
unitary
and
saying
that
if
the
state
determines
that
a
taxpayer
is
unitary,
then
automatically
thereafter
the
income
is
subject
to
apportionment
and
don't
confuse
us
with
the
facts
from
a
separate
accounting
analysis
because
they
don't
count.
well,
you
can't
write
the
constitution
out
by
a
state
statute
adopting
an
apportionment
formula.
the
state
is
just
arguing
for
unitary
per
se
and
not
considering
the
constitutional
principles.
now,
mr.
wilcox
indicated
that
we
were
attacking
the
wisconsin
formula.
we
have
never
asserted
that.
we
are
not
attacking
the
formula.
we
are
attacking
what
the
formula
was
applied
to.
if
the
formula
is
applied
merely
to
the
marketing
income,
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
but
to
apply
it
to
the
extraterritorial
income
which
the
record
conclusively
proves
was
identified
and
accurately
measured
outside
the
state,
it
gets
us
right
square
into
both
the
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause
analysis.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
do
not
believe
that
was
my
answer,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
pointed
out
i
think
in
response
to
that
question
that
that
would
not
solve
the
commerce
clause
problem,
because
the
situs
states,
the
producing
states
have
the
power
to
tax
that
situs
income
there
and
for
another
state
to
apportionment,
even
if
all
the
apportionment
formulas
were
uniform,
does
not
remove
the
overlap
or
the
risk
of
overlap
there.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
long
line
of
cases
that
establish
the
multiple
taxation
doctrine
have
established
that
it
is
the
risk
or
burden
of
multiple
taxation,
not
the
actuality
of
multiple
taxation.
this
court
has
said
so
in
a
couple
of
cases
as
recent
as
1975.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
if
the
states
did
not
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
oh,
mathematically,
you
could
probably
come
out
with
100
percent
of
the
income
but
i
don't
believe
that
reaches
the
commerce
clause
question
or
the
situs
income
question
for
the
producing
states
have
the
right
to
tax
it.
in
response
to
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
if
it
is
taxing
the
same
activity
that
wisconsin
is
trying
to
tax,
then
it
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
but
if
that
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
if
that
gross
production
is
sitused
in
that
state
and
then
for
wisconsin
to
use
that
gross
production
in
computing
its
formula,
you
end
up
with
an
overlap.
there
are
at
least
six
of
the
producing
states
that
do
tax
income
at
situs.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
property
tax
i
don't
believe
is
analogous
to
the
situation
here
at
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
and
here
we
are
dealing
with
wisconsin's
statute
that
specifically
allocates
the
income
from
a
farm,
mine
or
quarry
to
situs.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i
contend
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
wisconsin
to
put
on
blinders
and
say
that
if
this
is
a
unitary
business
everything
from
there
on
can
be
apportioned.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
not
if
a
second
step
in
the
analysis
is
required
and
that
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
rational
relationship
between
the
income
--
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
four
cases
that
i
have
discussed
here,
i
believe
they
support
that
answer.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
thomas
g.
ragatz
the
application
of
the
wisconsin
statute
we
contend
is
unconstitutional
and
we
further
contend
that
if
the
proof
of
extraterritorial
taxation
that
is
contained
in
the
record
here
is
not
sufficient,
then
i
respectfully
submit
that
perhaps
such
proof
is
judicially
impossible.
