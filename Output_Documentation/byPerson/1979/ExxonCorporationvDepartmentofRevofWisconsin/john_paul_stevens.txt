mr.
wilcox,
before
you
sit
down,
is
there
anything
in
the
wisconsin
statute
that
would
prevent
wisconsin
--
let
me
give
you
a
--
assume
for
a
second
that
the
marketing
division
was
the
really
profitable
one
within
the
company,
that
their
accounting
showed
that,
and
it
might
therefore
be
in
wisconsin's
interests
to
treat
the
marketing
operation
as
a
separate
unitary
business,
as
i
think
the
department
of
revenue
did
at
one
stage
of
this
proceeding.
is
there
anything
in
the
statute,
the
wisconsin
statute
that
would
prevent
wisconsin
from
saying,
well,
we
have
decided
to
define
unitary
just
to
include
the
marketing
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
the
taxing
authority
treat
marketing
separate
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
just
wisconsin,
and
then
the
first
round
didn't
they
just
expand
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
somewhere
along
the
line
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
fairly
reasonable
to
assume
that
had
that
been
the
most
profitable
division
of
the
company,
that
that
might
have
stuck?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
equally
possible
that
--
i'm
just
thinking
of
the
possibilities
of
multiple
taxation
--
that
down
in
texas
they
might
regard
the
exploration
and
development
as
the
separate
unitary
business?
there
is
probably
nothing
in
their
statute
that
would
preclude
them
from
doing
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
make
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
white
did,
that
perhaps
the
best
answer
to
this
problem
would
be
to
get
congress
into
the
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
uniformity
that
you
describe
is
uniformity
in
the
prevailing
practices
to
use
three-factor
formulas,
but
is
there
uniformity
in
how
you
go
about
defining
unitary
businesses,
which
is
perhaps
equally
important
but
i'm
not
sure
there
is
the
same
degree
of
uniformity
on
that
problem,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
once
you
define
the
unitary
business
then
it
is
just
a
question
of
applying
the
formula
to
find
out
what
portion
is
reasonable
attributable
to
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
also
really
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
proper
to
treat
as
a
unitary
the
question
business
because
the
whole
reason
for
the
unitary
business
is
to
solve
the
problem
of
how
much
is
fair
to
attribute
to
wisconsin
in
some
big
business,
we
don't
know
how
much
business
was
done
here,
and
so
you
develop
the
unitary
business
concept
and
say
we
don't
know,
we
will
use
a
formula
and
that
will
give
us
a
rough
estimate.
but
if
they
can
come
up
with
real
precise
figures
that
you
would
accept,
then
i
suppose
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
you
need
or
is
it
permitted
to
use
a
unitary
business
approach.
i'm
not
suggesting
i
know
the
answer,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
integrity
of
their
accounting
may
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
proper
to
use
the
unitary
business
device
which
is
a
substitute
for
accurate
accounting
when
it
is
unavailable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ragatz,
do
you
contend
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
wisconsin
to
treat
this
as
a
unitary
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
do
you
contend
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
wisconsin
to
treat
this
business
before
us
as
a
unitary
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
then
is
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
yes
it
is
if
they
treat
at
as
a
unitary
business
for
purposes
of
applying
their
formula?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
that
wisconsin
says
it
is
unitary
and
therefore
our
formula
applies,
and
if
that
is
what
calling
a
unitary
business
necessarily
entails,
it
is
unconstitutional
to
treat
it
as
a
unitary
business.
