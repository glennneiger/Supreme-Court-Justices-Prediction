this

in
exxon
corporation
v.
wisconsin
department
of
revenue.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
states
in
the
country
does
exxon
do
business
in
at
the
present
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
every
state
in
the
union
had
the
same
apportionment
as
wisconsin,
you
might
be
taxed
more
than
100
percent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
i
understand
that.
i
was
putting
that
as
the
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
oppressive
multiple
taxation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wilcox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
