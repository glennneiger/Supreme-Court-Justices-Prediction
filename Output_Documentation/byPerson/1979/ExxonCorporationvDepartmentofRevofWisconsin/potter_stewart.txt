justice

stewart
may
i
ask
whether
the
asset
factors
and
the
payroll
factors
that
contributed
to
the
generation
of
the
sales
to
third
parties
at
situs
were
included
in
the
denominator
of
the
formula?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand,
there
is
no
real
issue
on
the
fairness
of
the
formula
if
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
the
formula.
justice

stewart
mr.
ragatz,
could
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
a
factual
question.
lately
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
windfall
profits
that
oil
companies
may
have
earned
or
may
be
earning
as
a
result
of
increase
in
the
value
of
oil.
if
there
are
such
things,
and
i
guess
they
cone
to
a
period
later
than
are
at
issue
here,
which
of
the
divisions
would
earn
such
profits?
do
you
have
any
idea?
