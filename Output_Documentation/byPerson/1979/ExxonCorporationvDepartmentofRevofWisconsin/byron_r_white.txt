justice
byron
r.
white
except
if
it
weren't
unitary,
it
would
be
rather
relevant,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
if
the
state
tried
to
tax
it,
why,
they
would
tell
them
it
couldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
saying
they
were
taxing
out
of
state
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sure
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
i
am,
is
waiting
for
your
answer
to
his
question
about
the
central
office
overhead.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
understand
that
part
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
that
wherever
a
company
claims
that
it
can
do
this,
that
it
is
also
claiming
that
it
shouldn't
be
treated
as
a
unitary
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
part
of
its
business
isn't
part
of
the
unit
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
here
that
the
only
unitary
business
there
was
in
wisconsin
was
the
marketing
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
a
unitary
business
finding
means?
doesn't
it
mean
it
is
sort
of
a
truism
for
saying
you
must
treat
it
as
a
ball
and
go
through
--
as
one
ball
of
wax
and
go
through
this
formula
as
the
fairest
way
of
allocating
income
source?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
books
and
in
talking
about
unitary
businesses
and
allocation
formulas,
doesn't
unitary
mean
that
it
is
so
unitary
that
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
an
allocation
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
way
it
is
used
in
this
case,
you
would
think
it
automatically
precludes
your
attempt
to
separately
account.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
of
companies
who
are
conglomerates,
even
if
they
are
not
separately
organized
as
corporations,
say
they
have
ten
divisions,
each
division
is
engaged
in
an
absolutely
separate
business,
one
in
making
clothes
and
something
else,
running
theatres,
another
manufacturing
trucks,
another
division
which
runs
banks,
do
they
treat
each
one
of
them
as
unitary
businesses
or
do
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
saying
that
your
company
should
be
treated
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
separate
enough,
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
asking
does
the
record
show
actual
multiple
taxation,
so
that
you
are
being
doubly
taxed?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
tell
us
wether
texas
uses
a
three-factor
formula
or
just
taxes
separately
as
you
would
have
wisconsin
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
hope
i
am
not
interrupting
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
as
i
remember
the
case,
the
situs
sales
to
third
parties
was
treated
as
situs
income
and
excluded.
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
theory
of
that
exclusion
that
those
sales
were
not
part
of
the
unitary
business
or
alternatively
that
even
if
they
were
part
of
the
unitary
business,
they
should
not
be
treated
as
part
of
the
taxable
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wilcox,
do
you
believe
that
wisconsin
could
constitutionally
adopt
a
system
that
your
colleague
has
suggested
that
you
must
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
say
all
the
companies
like
exxon
who
are
capable
of
doing
it
are
supposed
to
divide
up
their
so-called
unitary
business
and
do
a
cost
accounting
job
and
figure
out
the
income
from
their
various
divisions
and
if
there
is
income
from
outside
the
state
we
just
won't
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
state
that
you
know
of
allow
this
type
of
accounting
and
tax
returning
that
your
colleague
suggests?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
if
the
exploration
and
development
division
or
what
they
argue
is
a
separate
division
is
the
most
profitable
of
the
three,
is
it
not
likely
that
the
state
of
texas
might
prefer
using
exxon's
approach
and
tax
on
that
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
suppose
just
looking
at
the
state
statute,
you
couldn't
really
tell
what
that
state
would
regard
as
a
unitary
business
and
conceivably
they
could
say,
well,
a
unitary
business
down
in
texas
is
exploration
and
development,
just
as
exxon
argues
here
--
and
i
suppose
exxon
down
there
would
take
the
position
you
are
taking
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
certainly
raises
the
possibility
of
an
inconsistent
result
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
first
have
to
determine
what
the
unitary
business
includes?
i
suppose
there
will
be
some
out
of
state
income
from
some
unrelated
activities
that
you
just
don't
count
as
part
of
the
unitary
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
treat
it
as
a
unitary
business
even
if
there
is
a
holding
company
and
it
has
three
separate
subsidiaries,
one
production,
one
refining
and
one
marketing,
you
would
treat
it
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
connected
with
the
interstate
multistate
tax
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
know
whether
there
is
any
pending
effort
in
congress
to
address
establishing
some
uniform
system
in
taxing
interstate
businesses
around
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
just
parallel
to
exxon
there
is
another
operation
going
on
from
texas
to
refining
to
wisconsin
by
three
separate
corporations
all
independently
owned,
but
they
had
exactly
the
same
flow,
and
it
was
just
that
the
market
allocated
where
the
income,
who
was
going
to
earn
the
income.
somebody
sold
to
the
refiner
and
the
refiner
sold
to
the
distributor
and
the
distributor
sells
to
the
--
and
you
accept
that,
you
have
to
accept
that,
i
gather.
you
are
just
going
to
get
part
of
the
marketing
income
allocated
to
you
and
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
say,
well,
part
of
the
income
of
the
refiner
we
deserve.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
separate
sales,
you
have
--
but
it
turns
out,
when
you
compare
that
exxon
has
made
exactly
internally,
that
one
company
has
made
exactly
the
same
allocation
of
profits
to
its
refining,
to
its
exploration
and
to
its
marketing
as
these
separate
companies
end
up
doing,
just
at
arm's
length.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
they
have,
let's
assume
it
is
absolutely
identical.
you
would
still
say
that
that
is
just
a
lot
of
nonsense
--
not
a
lot
of
nonsense,
but
you
just
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
because
you
have
a
formula
that
you
just
know
better
allocates
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
same
guy
inevitably
in
this
kind
of
a
setup
is
setting
both
the
selling
price
and
the
buying
price.
i
mean
there
is
no
real
negotiation,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
pursue
that
for
a
second.
i
understood
that
the
prices
that
they
used
for
the
intra-corporate
transfers
were
the
same
prices
that
were
generated
when
they
sold
at
arm's
length
to
third
parties,
and
that
you
in
effect
assumed
that
their
accounting
had
produced
results
which
would
have
been
produced
had
the
company
divisions
been
independently
owned.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
nevertheless
you
still
had
the
right
to
treat
it
as
a
unitary
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
general
wilcox,
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
i
sort
of
thought
we
were
taking
the
case
as
though,
like
you
take
a
complaint
and
you
assume
what
they
have
alleged
is
true,
even
though
the
case
hasn't
been
tried,
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
more
or
less
took
the
exxon
accounting
as
though
it
--
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
decision,
everything
they
say
is
true,
that
this
is
good
sound
accounting
and
if
it
was
at
arm's
length
it
would
have
come
out
precisely
the
same
way,
and
nevertheless
we
reach
the
result
that
it
is
a
unitary
business
and
the
formula
is
appropriate.
and
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
one
way
or
another,
as
i
understand
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
must
take
the
case
that
way
because
if
you
want
to
challenge
the
accounting
then
the
rationale
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
would
be
quite
different
i
think,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
think
the
accounting
is
material,
we
ought
to
send
it
back
for
some
findings
of
fact.
if
we
accept
their
theory
and
say,
well,
that
may
be
true
but
nevertheless
if
wisconsin
(a)
is
correct
in
treating
it
as
a
unitary
business,
and
(b)
having
so
treated
it
has
the
right
simply
to
apply
its
formula
and
not
get
into
the
accounting,
then
we
can
accept
everything
they
say
about
the
accounting
and
still
affirm.
but
if
the
accounting
is
material,
we
have
to
take
quite
a
different
analysis,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
though,
with
your
colloquy
with
justice
stevens,
that
you
accept
the
fact
that
exxon's
figures
with
respect
to
its
three
departments
are
precisely
the
same
figures
that
they
would
be
if
they
were
three
independently
owned
corporations.
even
so,
you
may
apply
the
formula
and
come
out
with
quite
a
different
result
than
you
would
get
if
you
treated
the
marketing
division
as
a
separate
corporation,
as
you
would
if
it
were
independently
owned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
accepted
the
integrity
of
the
figures,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
justice
asked
you
if
all
the
states
operated
exactly
like
wisconsin
and
applied
their
formula
which
would
be
just
like
wisconsin
to
exxon,
just
like
wisconsin
had,
there
would
not
be
double
taxation.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
a
formula
and
that
is
all
they
do,
they
apply
their
formula.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
the
right
to
tax
it,
but
you
are
just
saying
if
in
the
producing
state
they
have
an
extraction
tax,
just
a
gross
tax
on
extraction,
would
you
say
that
is
the
kind
of
a
situs
tax
you
are
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
gross
tax,
it
is
a
gross
production
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
a
net
income
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
the
same
thing
if
the
producing
state
just
has
property
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
have
to
say
that.
