chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
forsham
against
harris.
mr.
sonnenreich,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
involvement,
beyond
finances
or
limited
to
finances
and
definition
of
the
project?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit.
is
this
fundamentally
a
statutory
construction
case
for
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
else
is
it
besides
a
statutory
construction
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
are
you
asking
us
to
do
anything
except
to
construe
a
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
tell
us
very
early
in
your
brief
that
in
this
case,
we
cannot
rely
on
the
statutory
language.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
government
has
access
to
a
great
many
things
independent
of
contract.
i
suppose
your
answer
must
be
taken
as
meaning
access
which
the
government
could
enforce
in
some
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
access
which
a
university
might
or
a
private
research
corporation
might
grant
them
as
a
matter
of
accommodation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
one
of
the
big
drug
companies
working
with
millions
of
dollars
in
research
should
invite
and
permit
government's
people
from
the
national
institutes
of
health
and
elsewhere,
food
and
drug
administration,
to
come
in
and
monitor
or
at
least
observe
all
that
they
were
doing.
would
that
create
a
right
of
access,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
keystone
to
a
right
of
access
the
fact
that
the
government
funded
the
enterprise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
then
go
in,
they
could
then
require
the
government
to
produce
the
wage
records
of
private
employers
and
make
them
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
government
had
not
funded
it,
if
the
ford
foundation
did
not
funded
it,
there
would
not
be
any
case
at
all,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
by
saying
the
request
would
be
made,
you
are
telling
us
that
you
think
the
freedom
of
information
act
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
covered
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
how
does
then
the
government
funding
is
not
a
major
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case
if
there
were
no
government
funding
at
all,
would
you
still
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
powers
would
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
have
in
the
hypothetical
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
an
employee
of
the
post
office
department
--
well,
that
is
private
now,
but
let
us
say
of
the
defense
department,
sells
a
truck
or
an
airplane
that
is
in
his
possession,
certainly
the
government
could
get
it
back.
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
just
went
out
and
sold
it
--
that
sometimes
happens,
as
we
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
government
have
made
copies
of
all
these
records,
under
their
right
of
access?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
have
already
conceded
that
if
the
government
made
copies
and
took
them
over
to
nih
or
fda
they
would
be
agency
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
it
were
stolen,
in
a
hypothetical,
by
a
foreign
agent
and
taken
off
to
a
foreign
country,
impossibility
of
performance
would
be
a
defense
to
any
demand,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
stand
on
possession
and
control?
why
is
it
not
the
answer
to
that
that
you
cannot
give
someone
something
that
you
do
not
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
have
you
reached
on
agency?
the
question
of
the
definition
of
an
agency
record,
if
the
answer
to
the
request
can
be,
"we
are
very
sorry,
but
we
have
not
got
what
you
are
asking
for."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
plank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
congress
make
all
of
these
records
public
records
by
definition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
agency
could
make
the
grant
on
virtually
any
terms
they
wanted,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
one
minute
left,
mr.
sonnenreich.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
