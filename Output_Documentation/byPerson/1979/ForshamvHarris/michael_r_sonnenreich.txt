mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court,
in
our
case,
is
whether
certain
scientific
records
that
are
presently
located
in
a
maryland
bank
vault
are
federal
records
and
are
disclosable
under
the
federal
freedom
of
information
act.
the
committee
for
the
care
of
the
diabetic,
of
which
petitioners
are
members,
initiated
a
formal
freedom
of
information
act
request
from
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
in
1974,
the
data
resulting
from
a
scientific
study
which
has
been
called
the
ugdp
study.
the
study
involves
the
treatment
and
evaluation
of
the
treatment
of
diabetes.
this
request
was
denied
administratively
and
we
filed
an
action
with
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
our
request
for
relief
was
denied
by
judge
corcoran
in
that
court
--
denied
essentially
on
the
grounds
that
the
federal
government
did
not
posses
the
data
and
therefore
the
request
for
ugdp
records
in
the
court’s
judgment
were
not
at
agency
records.
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals,
we
again
were
denied
in
a
2:1
decision
to
release
the
data,
but
all
three
judges
rejected
the
strict
possession
property
test
called
upon
by
the
lower
court.
judge
leventhal
in
the
majority
opinion
set
a
standard
where
he
defined
agency
records
to
include
records
created
or
obtained
by
an
agency
in
the
course
of
doing
its
work.
in
elaborating
on
this
test,
he
stated
that
agency
records
are
not
limited
to
the
physical
possession
of
an
agency
but
it
can
include
the
records
which
are
created
and
held
by
private
entities
where
the
agency
is
involved
in
the
core
planning
or
execution
of
the
program.
judge
mackinnon
in
his
concurrence
also
stated
that
agency
records
can
include
those
created
by
private
entities
and
said
that
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
agency
records
must
be
made
will
be
done
on
a
factual
basis.
judge
bazelon
dissented
and
stated
that
the
records
created
and
held
by
private
entities
are
agency
records
when
the
government
has
been
significantly
involved
in
the
study
in
its
records.
what
is
interesting
--
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
essentially
--
we
have
set
it
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
53
through
55,
but
essentially
there
are
four
major
factors
that
show
government
involvement.
the
first
is
a
question
of
funding.
we
have
demonstrated
in
the
brief,
and
we
are
going
to
discuss
this,
that
you
not
only
have
a
funding
over
a
period
of
more
than
15
years,
we
not
only
have
a
funding
where
the
exclusive
funding
agency
is
the
federal
government
and
the
amount
involved
was
in
excess
of
$15
million,
but
in
addition,
the
government
also
funded
the
planning
grants
--
a
two-year
planning
grant
to
initiate
the
study.
another
factor
that
was
extremely
important
in
terms
of
showing
involvement
is
the
fact
that
the
monitoring
and
the
supervision
by
the
national
institutes
of
health
in
the
project
itself,
or
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
case,
in
our
brief
that
some
of
that
involvement
is
instructive
to
the
court.
for
example,
they
established
a
policy
planning
board
and
they
put
members
of
the
national
institute
of
health
on
that
board,
one
of
the
senior
officials
being
the
chairman
of
the
board.
they
were
very
actively
involved
in
analyzing
and
evaluating
the
actual
planning
and
policy
of
the
study.
more
important
in
respect
to
that
second
factor
was
that
the
board
met
regularly
at
the
national
institute
of
health
to
review
the
actual
progress
of
the
study,
which
in
and
of
itself
was
unusual.
more
unusual
still
was
that
nih,
because
of
some
of
the
questions
that
had
been
raised,
went
outside
and
contracted
with
an
independent
group
of
statisticians
--
the
biometric
society
to
actually
go
in
and
evaluate
the
raw
data
of
the
study.
this
is
not
a
usual
activity
on
the
part
of
the
national
institute
of
health
or
of
hew.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
dr.
donald
whedon
in
his
memorandum,
in
his
affidavit
before
the
lower
court
so
stated
that
that
is,
in
fact,
a
very
rare
occurrence.
a
third
important
factor
to
show
the
substantial
government
involvement
was
the
action
--
by
the
action
of
the
government
in
terms
of
regulatory
action.
what
is
important
is
that
while
the
national
institutes
of
health
were
monitoring
and
supervising
the
study,
another
sub-agency
of
hew
--
the
food
and
drug
administration
--
began
to
take
a
series
of
very
significant
steps
in
reliance
on
this
study.
in
1970,
the
fda
sent
a
series
of
drug
bulletins
to
all
physicians
in
the
united
states
advising
them
of
the
findings
of
the
study
and
warning
them
about
its
implications
in
the
treatment
of
their
diabetic
patients.
these
bulletins
were
then
followed
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
making
a
proposed
rule
re-labeling
the
oral
hypoglycemics
by
inserting
a
warning
based
on
this
ugdp
study.
this
proposal
was
first
discussed
by
the
fda
in
1972
and
was
finally
proposed
in
1975.
in
1977,
in
direct
reliance,
the
secretary
of
hew
proposed
that
one
of
the
drugs
in
the
ugdp
study,
phenformin,
be
suspended
from
the
marketplace.
again,
the
secretary
relied
heavily
on
the
ugdp
data
and
the
ugdp
study.
from
all
of
these
regulatory
activities,
ranging
from
official
bulletins
of
the
fda
that
went
directly
to
physicians
to
proposed
rule-making
to
regulatory
proceedings,
the
government
relied
heavily
on
the
ugdp
as
the
justification
for
its
actions.
but
the
most
important
of
these
effects
is
the
fourth
and
final
factor
that
i
think
is
clear
showing
of
reliance
on
the
part
of
the
government,
and
that
is
when
the
government
itself
through
the
fda
decided
to
audit
the
raw
data.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
to
a
certain
extent,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
what
has
happened
is
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
evolving
a
series
of
standards
because
the
statutory
language
does
not
speak
directly
to
what
constitutes
agency
records.
and
what
is
before
this
court,
petitioners
contend,
is
trying
to
amalgamate
or
define
with
more
precision
what
it
is,
what
type
of
test
has
to
be
utilized
now
in
terms
of
determining
what
are
agency
records.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
your
honor.
we
are
asking
you
to
define
that
test
by
construing
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
the
statutory
language
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
is
silent
on
what
constitutes
agency
records.
what
has
happened
is
that
the
courts
have
had
to
evolve
a
series
of
tests
to
determine
what
those
actions
are.
the
statutory
intent
is
very
clear,
and
that
is
that
the
intent
of
the
statute
is
to
permit
disclosure,
and
is
to
make
the
government
accountable
for
the
activities
and
the
actions
that
it
performs.
the
problem
that
we
deal
with
now
and
the
reason
why
we
feel
this
case
is
so
important
is
that
in
defining
the
threshold
issue
of
what
constitutes
the
agency
records,
we
are
also
defining
what
is
the
accountability
of
the
government.
the
problem
that
we
have
in
defining,
it
is
the
only
way
you
can
examine
and
determine
what
are
those
agency
records
as
to
look
directly
at
the
involvement
of
the
government
and
then
interpret
what
that
action
of
the
government
is
in
the
determination
of
what
is
the
agency
record.
the
statute,
the
only
thin
light
or
light
that
we
get
is
the
attorney
general's
memorandum
opinion
of
1967
which
has
some
definition
of
what
constitutes
agency
records
in
the
sense
that
he
makes
two
separate
distinctions
and
they
talk
in
terms
of
possession
or
control.
the
problem
is
that
the
courts
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
trying
to
determine
possessory
standards
and
apply
possessory
standards
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
because
they
are
involved
in
this
balancing
and
this
weighing
of
what
it
is
that
the
act
really
intends
for
the
government
to
do
in
terms
of
making
it
accountable,
and
on
the
other
hand,
trying
to
make
certain
that
the
uncertainties
are
not
so
great
that
the
act
encompasses
everything.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
if
the
is
completely
privately
owned
and
there
is
no
access
by
the
government
and
there
is
no
reliance
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
it
would.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
because
what
happens
is
that
the
government
has
gone
beyond
that
statement
in
reaching
out
to
utilize
the
data,
has
reached
out
to
substantially
involve
itself
with
the
data
process.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
if
that
were
the
contract
and
there
was
no
right
to
the
data,
the
government
did
not
rely
on
it,
then
my
answer
would
be
yes,
it
would
settle
the
matter
for
me.
that
is
not,
of
course,
the
case
in
point,
nor
is
it
that
the
case
in
point,
in
fact
that
the
government
did
have
access,
did
exercise
access,
did
audit
the
data,
did
put
its
hands
on
the
data,
and
did
rely
on
the
data,
both
for
regulatory
action
and
for
regulatory
decision-making.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
or
exercise.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no.
the
question
becomes
that
if
they
can
have
it.
if
they
have
the
right
to
exercise
access
to
the
data,
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
points
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
government
involvement.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
i
do
not
think
that
creates
a
right
of
access,
your
honor.
the
question
would
follow,
"and
what
did
they
do
with
what
it
is
that
they
monitored,
sought,
and
examined?"
if
they
then
went
ahead
and
relied
on
it,
the
question
is
yes,
we
would
think
that
would
be
substantial
government
involvement
because
they
did
have
access
–-
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
and
that
they
had
the
right
to
it,
specifically.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
kind
of
data
is
a
different
type
of
data
than
the
type
of
data
we
are
looking
at.
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
examine
what
it
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
data.
the
data
that
i
believe
you
are
addressing
is
a
ministerial
kind
of
data
that
is
a
collation
and
function
of
collection.
what
we
are
involved
in
here
is
data
the
predicate
of
which
government
action
was
taken
because
it
forms
a
decision-making
basis
for
conclusions,
recommendations
and
findings,
which
is
far
different
from
the
type
of
data
that
you
are
addressing
in
the
fair
labor
–
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
if
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
government
does
then
do
rule-making
on
the
basis
of
that,
i
would
submit
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
unless
it
is
exempted,
yes.
the
point
that
i
did
want
to
make
in
turn
in
talking
about
the
fact
situation
in
showing
the
government
involvement
here
was
the
fact
that
the
audit
is
a
very
significant
factor
in
this
case
and
does
to
a
certain
extent
make
this
case
somewhat
unique.
the
reason,
as
i
stated,
was
for
that
audit
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
study
and
the
integrity
of
the
database.
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
biometric’s
audit
which
was
contracted
for
by
nih.
the
food
and
drug
administration
decided
to
audit
the
data
itself.
it
physically
went
out
to
the
coordinating
center
in
baltimore,
selected
data,
examined
the
data,
copied
some
parts
of
the
data,
and
then
took
back
limited
portions
of
the
data
that
they
had
seen
back
to
rockville,
maryland.
what
happened
was
that
after
completing
the
audit,
the
food
and
drug
administration
then
published
its
findings
as
final
findings
in
november
of
1978.
it
then
went
back
and
renewed
its
proposal
of
three
years
earlier,
which
was
to
require
a
warning
be
placed
on
all
oral
hypoglycemic
drugs.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
we
submit,
is
whether
the
raw
data
of
the
study
funded
by
the
government,
monitored
by
the
government,
relied
upon
by
the
government,
and
even
audited
by
the
government,
are
agency
records
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
looking
at
the
fact
basis
of
this
case,
petitioners
contend
that
these
are
agency
records.
now,
respondents
in
their
argument
to
date
have
raised
a
series
of
issues
which
tend
to
blur
what
we
perceive
to
be
the
central
issue
of
this
case.
i
would
like
to
just
take
a
moment
with
the
court
to
raise
some
of
the
issues
that
respondent
raises
and
answer
them.
they
are
in
basis
three.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
data
being
sought
involved
identifiable
patient
records.
petitioners
contend
that
this
is
not
so.
the
data
that
the
petitioners
are
seeing
or
wishing
to
see
and
examine
is
the
same
data
that
the
food
and
drug
administration,
or
for
that
matter
the
biometric
society,
saw
or
could
have
seen
when
they
undertook
their
data,
their
audit
of
the
data.
we
are
not
looking
to
reveal
patient
identity
and
there
is
not
a
confidentiality
issue,
petitioners
submit,
in
this
case.
it
was
also
suggested
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
the
ugdp
a
government
agency
in
order
to
find
the
raw
data
agency
records.
again,
we
submit
this
is
not
so.
the
agency
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
department
of
health
education,
and
welfare
and
its
sub-agencies.
we
are
not
contending
that
the
ugdp
is
a
government
agency.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
the
argument
that
they
advanced,
but
they
advanced
it
principally
on
the
issue
of
possession
rather
than
on
control.
because
in
this
particular
case
what
has
happened
is
that
the
government
has
gone
out
on
two
occasions
by
contracting
directly
put
their
hands
on
the
data,
so
the
control
issue
of
did
the
government
have
control
to
reach
out
and
examine
the
data
–-
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
yes,
but
that
is
–
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
and
what
we
submit
it
did
have
control
then
and
it
does
have
control
now.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
the
problem
with
this
kind
of
data
is
the
definition
of
ownership.
yes,
they
are
owned
by
the
ugdp
group.
the
fact
that
people
can
go
and
examine
the
data
and
take
the
data
away
and
still
have
ownership
remain
with
the
ugdp
is
that
we
are
transmitting
information
not
dealing
with
tangible
items,
so
what
happens
is
yes,
they
have
ownership
of
the
data,
but
also
yes,
the
government
has
a
right
of
access
to
walk
in,
take
the
data,
copy
the
data,
analyze
the
data,
and
go
back
to
rockville,
maryland
with
it,
leaving
it
in
their
possession,
in
their
ownership,
and
then
the
government
has
the
ownership
of
what
it
did
with
the
data.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
were
not
owned?
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
they
were
not
specifically
owned?
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
especially
with
respect
to
the
generation
of
data
and
the
transmission
of
scientific
data.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
because
what
is
involved
here
is,
we
have
to
step
back
a
moment,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
government
relied
on
a
conclusion,
and
in
order
for
the
government
to
deal
with
data,
the
government
has
to
analyze,
evaluate
it.
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
reading
data
and
copying
it
ministerially.
the
data
has
to
be
organized
in
a
way
to
prove
or
disprove
conclusions.
this
is
why
i
was
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
between
data
which
is
merely
collective,
for
example
in
sdc
versus
matthews,
which
is
put
in
the
medlar
survey
at
the
national
library
of
medicine.
and
it
is
there
and
you
can
retrieve
it
and
you
can
read
it,
as
opposed
to
data
which
is
action-oriented
data
in
the
sense
that
in
order
to
understand
it,
in
order
to
utilize
it,
you
have
to
evaluate
it,
you
have
to
analyze
it.
and
that
is
what
the
government
did,
because
the
only
way
that
you
can
test
the
conclusions
of
the
government
is
not
to
just
compile
a
series
of
pieces
of
information.
what
you
have
to
do
is
analyze
it
to
show
that
the
integrity
of
the
data,
the
veracity
of
the
data,
in
fact
meets
those
scientific
judgments.
so,
there
is
a
fundamental
problem
in
getting
at
that
kind
of
data.
it
is
more
than
simply
saying,
"well,
it
is
there,
and
can
i
retrieve
it
or
can
i
not
retrieve
it?"
i
have
to
do
more
than
retrieve
it.
i
have
to
use
it.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
government
did,
and
what
the
government's
argument
has
always
been
is
trying
to
separate
utilizing
in
reliance
on
the
study
and
utilizing
in
reliance
on
the
raw
data,
which
is
the
fundament
of
the
study.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
i
am
sorry;
i
did
not
hear
that.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
i
do
not.
my
feeling
is
that
the
definition
is
instructive,
but
it
is
not
dispositive.
my
feeling
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
federal
records
act
is
slightly
different
from
the
purpose
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
the
disclosure
requirements
and
the
goal
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
could
well
and
does
well
change
what
constitutes
an
agency
record.
i
do
want
to
point
out
one
other
point
that
the
government
contends,
and
that
is
that
the
government
contends
that
the
test
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
this
court
adopt
will
in
fact
blur
the
so-called
bright
line
of
law
defining
agency
records.
now,
this
is
not
before
the
court,
but
we
will
not
argue
and
we
do
not
argue
whether
or
not
the
test,
that
test
may
exist
as
to
who
gets
records
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
we
do
say
that
under
this
standard
and
the
standards
enunciated
in
the
courts
below,
it
does
not
have
applicability
here.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
what
we
are
involved
in
here
and
what
the
court
has
to
decide
here
is,
where
is
the
door
to
get
into
the
freedom
of
information
act?
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
correct;
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
what
we
are
stating
in
this
argument
that
respondents
made
is
that
we
do
direct
the
court
that
ciba-geigy
versus.
matthews,
forsham
versus
califano
below,
sdc
versus
matthew,
all
went
beyond
discussing
the
possessory
test
and
all
went
towards
trying
to
evaluate
federal
involvement,
government
involvement,
in
the
use
or
in
the
dealings
with
those
records,
and
they
are
all
talking
about
private
entities
which
are
possessing
the
records.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
all
are
cases
below.
but
the
cases
below
do
indicate,
your
honors,
that
the
concept
of
agency
records
do
not
lend
themselves
to
precise
definition,
and
they
are
moving
away
from
this
technical
property
test
toward
a
much
more
functional
approach
of
examining
the
factual
basis
of
the
area,
of
the
particular
case,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
involvement
is
such
that
would
render
those
agency
records.
all
agree
you
do
not
have
to
be
an
agency
in
order
to
have
agency
records.
the
question
is,
functionally,
what
triggers
the
test
and
makes
them
agency
records,
letting
people
in
the
freedom
of
information
door?
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
the
reason
that
the
petitioners
are
looking
for
the
records
is
because
of
this
enormous
scientific
controversy
that
has
now
raged
for
nine
years,
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
quite
honestly
is
evaluate
the
records
against
the
published
conclusions
of
the
ugdp
to
determine
whether
in
fact
they
are
true,
and
whether
or
not
they
are
not.
in
fact
the
data
supports
the
conclusions
made.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
but
that
is
true
with
any
--
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
--
freedom
of
information
situation.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
that.
i
do
want
to
raise
one
--
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
the
reason
we
are
here
is
very
simply
that
this
has
affected
the
impact
on
the
treatment
of
diabetes,
and
it
has
affected
five
million
diabetics.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
the
committee
of
the
care
of
the
diabetic
are
reputable
diabetologists
and
physicians
and
their
patients,
and
the
only
reason
that
this
committee
was
formed
was
because
of
the
scientific
controversy
surrounding
the
ugdp,
was
to
try
and
get
and
evaluate
this
data
to
determine
in
fact
whether
or
not
it
was
scientifically
correct.
one
unusual
factor
in
this
case
that
should
be
pointed
out
is
the
test
of
scientific
credibility
is
always
to
make
the
data
available
whenever
there
is
scientific
controversy.
the
peer
review
process
is
the
way
in
which
the
conclusions
are
tested
by
examining
the
data.
what
makes
this
case
unique
is
that
we
are
not
getting
the
data,
and
what
is
unique
is
that
researchers
that
were
involved
in
the
program
have
been
denied
the
data.
foreign
scientists
have
been
denied
the
data.
that
is
the
uniqueness
of
this
case.
for
reasons
that
we
cannot
understand,
the
normal
peer
process
is
not
working.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
no,
if
the
ford
foundation
had
funded
it
and
the
government
had
had
access
to
the
data,
and
the
government
had
substantially
involved
itself
in
that
process
and
relied
on
it,
the
request
would
be
made
under
freedom
of
information
for
that
data.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
would
apply.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
it
is
a
factor.
it
is
one
of
many
factors
that
the
that
courts
must
look
at
in
defining
what
is
significant
government
involvement
in
a
particular
fashion.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
if
we
had
the
right
of
access
and
the
government
relied
on
the
data,
yes,
your
honor,
we
would.
the
only
point
that
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
is
that
there
is
a
problem
that
the
court
must
address,
and
that
is,
if
the
test
is
very
narrowly
construed
from
the
possession
standpoint,
one
of
the
problems
that
arises
is
the
whole
question
of
government
accountability.
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
intended
to
grant
public
access
to
documents.
it
was
not
intended
to
be
used
tactically
to
circumvent
disclosure,
and
the
narrower
the
test,
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
disclosure.
we
also
concede
that
the
broader
the
test,
the
more
uncertainty
creeps
in,
in
trying
to
define
what
is
it
significant
government
involvement.
the
problem
before
this
court
on
a
larger
scale
is
to
define
that
test
so
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
itself
is
not
subverted,
and
that
there
is
not
a
withholding
by
using
various
means
to
get
around
definitions
of
agency
records
so
that
legitimate
reasons
where
the
public
has
a
right
to
access
to
that
data.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
sonnenreich
yes.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
few
things
to
the
court,
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
right
of
access.
the
right
of
access
is
clear
in
the
contract
made
between
the
government
and
the
ugdp,
and
the
regulations
of
hew,
section
74.23
clearly
allow
the
right
of
access
to
copy
the
records,
take
the
records,
analyze
the
records,
and
make
an
audit,
so
that
the
contract
between
the
parties
is
very
clearly
allowing
that.
in
addition,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
fda
which
stepped
in
to
do
the
audit
has
its
own
regulation,
21
cfr
20.105(d),
which
equally
makes
it,
all
the
raw
data,
available
to
any
research
that
had
been
conducted
by
the
fda.
the
only
question
i
posit
for
the
court
is
the
question
that
what
we
are
involved
with
here
is
two
agencies,
one
of
which
would
have
allowed
under
its
own
regulation
all
the
raw
data
given,
as
opposed
to
another
agency
that
does
not,
and
the
question
is,
we
are
in
a
question
of
agency
shopping.
thank
you.
