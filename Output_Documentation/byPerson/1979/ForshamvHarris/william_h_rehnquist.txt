justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
is
your
analogy
of
the
data,
of
the
use
by
the
government
here
any
different
than
reading
a
magazine
that
somebody
else
owns
or
reading
a
book
that
somebody
else
owns?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
those
are
cases
from
this
court,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me
again,
why
do
your
people
want
these
records?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
people
can
get
them
under
the
foia,
presumably
a
drunk
can
walk
in
off
the
street
and
get
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
united
states
attorney
in
baltimore
decides
that
there
has
been
fraud
against
the
government
committed
in
connection
with
some
of
these
grant
programs
and
subpoenas
and
copies
some
of
this
raw
data?
would
you
concede
that
those
were
federal
records?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
someone
who
accepts
a
large
grant
from
the
federal
government
complain
about
interference
with
its
privacy
or
its
goals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
purpose
of
the
federal
grant
is
what
congress
determines
it
to
be,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
forsham
case
is
a
companion
case
to
the
kissinger
case
arising
out
of
a
nationwide
group
of
private
physicians,
00:11
scientists
specializing
in
the
treatment
of
diabetes
forming
a
group
program
to
conduct
a
long
term
study
of
the
effectiveness
of
different
methods
for
treating
diabetes.
over
the
years,
this
study
has
received
approximately
$15
million
in
federal
grant
funding
from
the
department
of
hew.
it
has
generated
more
than
$55
million
records
documenting
the
treatment
of
more
than
1000
diabetic
patients.
in
the
last
decade,
this
group
has
published
findings
based
on
this
data
indicating
that
certain
known
methods
for
treating
adult
diabetes
increase
the
patient's
risk
there
from
cardiovascular
disease.
these
findings
have
generated
its
substantial
professional
debate.
another
group
of
physicians
involved
in
the
treatment
of
diabetic
patients
calling
themselves
as
the
committee
and
care
of
the
diabetic
known
as
the
ccd
have
been
among
those
critical
of
this
first
group's
findings.
the
ccd
determined
that
it
was
necessary
to
gain
access
to
the
university
group
data
in
order
to
effectively
scrutinize
these
studies
findings.
physicians
who
are
members
of
ccd
--
petitioners
in
this
court
sought
to
obtain
access
to
the
data
by
filing
an
foia
request
with
the
department
of
hew.
hew
denied
the
request
for
the
data
on
the
grounds
that
the
only
required
disclosure
of
agency
records
was
the
records
generated
by
the
university
group
and
that
these
were
not
agency
records.
the
ccd
for
physicians
then
filed
this
foia
suite
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
an
order
requiring
hew
to
make
all
of
the
raw
data
complied
by
the
university
group
available
to
them.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
upheld
hew's
determination
that
the
data
sought
were
not
discoverable
under
fioa.
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
enacting
the
freedom
of
information
act.
congress
granted
a
public
a
right
of
access
to
agency
records,
the
data
which
the
petitioners
requested
have
been
apprehended
solely
by
the
efforts
of
a
privately
controlled
organization
which
has
it
all
times
required
possession
--
retain
possession
of
the
data.
we
hold
that
when
federal
agency
has
neither
created
nor
obtained
records
generated
by
private
organization,
those
records
are
not
agency
records
and
therefore,
are
not
available
pursuant
to
request
under
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
