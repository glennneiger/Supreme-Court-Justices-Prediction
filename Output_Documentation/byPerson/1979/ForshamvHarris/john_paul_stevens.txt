you
would
win
the
lawsuit
i
would
propound
because
you
say,
"we
are
not
withholding
it.
they
stole
it."
justice

but
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
as
why
you
take
this
what
seems
to
me
rather
strange
position
that
that
stops
being
an
agency
record.

maybe
somebody
could
donate
the
documents
to
the
library
of
congress,
too.
