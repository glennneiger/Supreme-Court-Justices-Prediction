unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
is
it
your
position
that
if
a
research
contract
expressly
provided
that
the
raw
data
would
remain
the
property
of
the
researcher,
and
that
the
government
would
have
no
access
to
the
raw
data,
would
you
still
be
making
an
argument
that
that
data
--
unknown
speaker
let
us
just
say
you
had
exact
same
facts
in
this
case,
everything
happened
except
that
the
contract
said
that
the
data
remains
the
property
of
the
researcher
and
the
government
will
have
no
access.
that's
the
only
change
in
the
entire
case.
would
that
settle
the
matter,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
access
to
everything
that
the
researchers
have
reported
to
it,
and
it
can
take
action
based
on
what
the
researchers
report
to
it.
but
if
this
contract
said,
"you
keep
the
basic
data
and
we
do
not
want
to
look
at
it,
and
we
cannot
look
at
it."
would
that
not
settle
the
matter
for
you?
unknown
speaker
my
recollection
is
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
authorizes
the
government
to
inspect
the
wage
and
hour
records
of
private
employers
if
it
thinks
there
may
be
a
violation,
and
also
requires
the
keeping
of
those
records.
do
you
think
that
a
citizen
could
file
a
suit
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
requesting
a
private
employer's
wage
and
hour
records?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
information
that
my
brother
rehnquist
refers
to
might
turn
out
to
be
the
very
basis
for
a
regulation
or
a
rule-making.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
that
argument
of
the
government
is
just
corollary
to
the
basic
argument
that
agency
records,
whatever
else
they
are,
must
be
in
possession
or
control
of
a
governmental
agency.
and
since
ugdp
is
not
a
governmental
agency,
then
these
cannot
be
agency
records,
since
these
raw
data
are
concededly
in
the
possession
or
control
of
ugdp?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
now?
did
it
have
control
at
the
time
of
your
request,
that
is
the
issue,
i
think,
in
this.
unknown
speaker
not
that
it
did
ever
have
control.
unknown
speaker
leaving
that
control
to
one
side
for
just
a
moment,
in
the
statement,
the
question
presented
in
the
government's
brief,
they
recite
that
the
records
were
generated,
owned,
and
possessed
by
a
private
non-government
group.
now,
i
gather
you
agree
with
the
fact
that
it
is
a
non-governmental
group
and
that
they
are
possessed
and
generated
by
that
group.
what
about
ownership?
do
you
agree
that
the
records
were
owned
by
that
group?
unknown
speaker
could
just
this
one
thing,
if
i
may.
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
where
documents
that
were
not
owned
by
the
agency
involved
were
required
to
be
produced
unknown
speaker
that
not
owned
by
the
government,
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
your
point
is
that
common-law
notions,
property
notions
of
ownership
are
basically
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sonnenreich,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
technical
aspect.
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
not
define
agency
records?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
concede
that
the
applicable
definition
is
that
in
the
federal
records
act?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
the
applicable
definition
here
is
the
one
contained
in
the
federal
records
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
if
one
thing
was
clear,
it
was
that
if
anybody
gets
records
under
the
foia,
everybody
does.
anybody.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
abolished
the
normal
concepts
of
standing,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
or
any
showing
of
need,
or
–
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
right
under
the
foia,
then
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
can
equally
get
this
information?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
inquiry
as
to
why
your
people
want
them
is
totally
irrelevant
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
except
that
i
am
curious.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
your
claim
is
not
that
of
a
drunk
off
the
street.
you
claim
a
legitimate
scientific
reason
for
seeing
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
when
you
talk
about
possession
and
control,
you
concede
that
a
government
agency
could
not
avoid
its
obligation
under
this
statute
by
transferring
records
to
a
warehouse
or
something
like
that.
what
about
the
equivalent
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
where
in
fact
neither
had
possession
nor
control
because
it
had
legally
conveyed
possession
and
control
to
john
smith?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
had
absolutely
given
up
possession
and
control.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
mr.
geller,
that
where
the
records
were
generated
has
any
bearing
at
all
on
the
definition
of
what
are
agency
records?
in
this
case,
the
records,
the
alleged
records
were
not
generated
within
the
agency.
in
the
case
to
be
argued
next,
the
records,
if
they
were
records,
were
generated
within
the
agency.
do
you
suppose
that
has
any
effect
upon
the
definition?
unknown
speaker
possession
and
control
are
the
only
two
tests,
in
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that
but
is
it
not
foia
–
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
let
me
ask
the
question
i
asked
of
your
opponent.
do
you
accept
the
federal
records
definition
of
agency
records
as
applicable
to
the
foia?
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
the
contract
not
only
gave
the
government
the
right
to
access
for
some
limited
purposes,
but
also
said
that
if
the
government
chooses
to
make
public
the
underlying
data?
unknown
speaker
your
proposed
test
is
not
possession
or
control,
but
possession
and
control?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
whole
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
let
us
explore
your
test
with
one
another
example:
supposing
you
had
what
were
admittedly
agency
records
on
a
given
date
and
they
were
stolen
by
a
foreign
agent
or
a
private
party.
would
they
cease
to
be
agency
records?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
remained
the
property
of
the
government,
they
are
owned
by
the
government?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
you
do
mention
in
your
statement
of
the
question
presented,
you
point
out
the
fact
that
these
were
owned
by
a
private
organization.
unknown
speaker
well,
normally
if
you
talk
about
a
person's
records,
you
do
assume
you
are
talking
about
things
he
owns.
i
do
not
know
why
you
do
not
make
the
same
assumption
here?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
that
is
a
different
question.
now,
my
example,
there
would
presumably
be
no
withholding,
if
they
have
been
stolen,
because
you
are
not
withholding
something
you
do
not
have
possession
of.
would
it
stop
being
an
agency
record
simply
because
a
spy
emptied
the
files?
this
is
rather
a
strange
concept.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
matters
on
how
we
decide
the
case,
if
we
buy
your
example,
i
mean
your
definition.
unknown
speaker
and
very
frankly,
under
your
test,
if
the
records
had
been
stolen
by
somebody,
they
would
not
be
within
the
possession
and
control
of
the
agency
at
that
time
--
unknown
speaker
--at
the
time
of
the
request.
so,
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
is
very
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
under
your
test.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
say
that
the
documents
placed
in
a
private
warehouse
remain
agency
records.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
the
stolen
document
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
i
am
puzzled
that
you
use
the
definition,
because
you
would
win
that
lawsuit
because
there
is
no
withholding,
and
i
am
just
not
quite
clear
on
why
you
are
so
firm
on
the
notion
they
will
stop
being
agency
records.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
excuse
me
for
persisting
in
this
one
thought,
but
supposing
you
had
an
agency
proceeding,
like
a
lawsuit,
where
a
long
record
and
transcript
and
briefs
were
compiled
and
that
whole
record
was
stolen
by
lawyers,
would
you
say
that
would
cease
to
be
an
agency
record?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
they
stole
the
original.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
might
remand
an
agency
record
if
so
determined
under
the
federal
records
act,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
which
statute
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me
asking,
i
suppose
the
contract
may
determine
it?
