mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
definition
of
agency
records
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
in
the
government's
view,
agency
records
are
records
relating
to
the
affairs
of
a
federal
agency
that
are
in
the
possession
and
control
of
that
agency.
as
we
have
explained
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
this
definition
is
first
of
all
supported
by
the
language
of
the
foia
which
requires
all
federal
agencies
to
"make
available
agency
records,"
and
which
prohibits
agencies
from
"withholding"
such
records.
giving
this
language
its
ordinary
commonsense
meaning,
we
contend
that
an
agency
can
neither
make
available
nor
withhold
what
it
does
not
possess.
moreover,
this
definition
also
finds
support
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
legislative
debates
show
quite
clearly
that
what
congress
was
principally
concerned
about
in
passing
the
foia
and
what
was
thought
to
be
the
principal
defect
under
the
predecessor
of
the
foia,
section
3(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
was
that
federal
agencies
had
refused
to
divulge
public
documents
that
were
in
their
unquestioned
possession
and
control.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
voluminous
congressional
hearings
or
committee
reports
or
floor
debates
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
the
act
to
reach
documents
in
the
hands
of
private
parties
that
happened
to
do
business
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
to
begin
with,
we
construe
possession
to
mean
constructive
possession.
if
the
agency
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
foia
does
not
require
government
agencies
to
hold
on
to
any
particular
records.
there
are
other
federal
statutes
that
may
well
do
that,
such
as
the
federal
records
act
and
the
records
disposal
act,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
agency
or
the
attorney
general
could
force
to
return
those
records.
but
we
think
that
the
foia
only
requires
government
agencies
to
turn
over
to
the
public
on
request
records
agencies
that
are
in
their
possession
and
control
when
the
request
comes
in.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
so
far
as
the
foia
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
federal
agency
could
destroy
the
records,
if
they
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
federal
records
act
requires
the
government
agencies
to
maintain
record
systems
that
indicate
the
work
of
the
particular
agency.
if
something
falls
within
the
federal
records
act,
that
is,
if
an
agency
determines
that
something
is
a
federal
record,
then
that
agency
cannot
dispose
off
that
record
without
the
consent
of
the
administrator
of
gsa,
who
has
delegated
that
authority
to
the
archivist.
now,
if
the
agency
in
violation
of
the
federal
records
act
were
to
dispose,
transfer
certain
records,
then
the
records
disposal
act
would
allow
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
suit
for
the
return
of
the
records.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
if
he
did
not
have
authority
to
dispose
off
it.
i
assume
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
as
the
government
is
the
true
owner,
it
could
bring
a
replevin
action,
i
assume,
and
the
federal
records
act,
the
records
disposal
act
provide
a
similar
cause
of
action
for
the
government
when
federal
records
are
unlawfully
disposed
off.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
for
foia
purposes,
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
what
is
relevant
for
foia
purposes
is
whether
at
the
time
the
foia
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
although
for
other
purposes,
as
i
said,
federal
records
act
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
for
foia
purposes,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
believe
that
the
agency
records
definition
under
the
foia
includes
everything
that
is
a
federal
record
under
the
federal
records
act
if
it
is
in
the
government's
possession
and
control.
now,
there
is
a
question
whether
something
that
is
not
a
federal
record
under
the
federal
records
act
but
is
instead
non-record
materials
has
to
be
turned
over
under
the
foia
if
it's
in
the
government's
possession
and
control.
we
discussed
that
issue
in
footnote
38
of
our
brief
in
the
kissinger
case,
to
be
argued
next,
and
i
think
that
is
an
unsettled
question.
but
we
think
at
the
very
least
the
definition
of
agency
records
in
the
foia
includes
everything
that
is
a
federal
record
under
the
federal
records
act,
if
it
is
in
the
government's
possession
at
the
time
the
foia
request
comes
in.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
legislative
history
includes
nothing
to
support
petitioner's
theory
of
agency
records,
and
we
think
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
result
without
some
discussion
of
what
judge
leventhal
correctly
termed
the,
"awesome
implications"
that
such
a
result
would
have.
indeed,
it
seems
entirely
reasonable
to
conclude
that
in
referring
to
agency
records
when
enacting
the
foia,
congress
was
aware
of
and,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
just
mentioned,
meant
to
rely
at
least
in
part
on
the
definition
of
federal
records
in
the
federal
records
act
and
the
records
disposal
act.
this
definition
refers
to
documentary
materials
that
are
made
or
received
by
an
agency
in
connection
with
the
transaction
of
public
business,
and
that
are
preserved
or
appropriate
for
preservation
by
the
agency.
and
once
again,
we
think
that
this
definition
plainly
suggests
that
only
documents
in
an
agency's
possession
and
control
were
meant
to
be
included
within
the
disclosure
requirements
of
the
foia.
finally,
we
believe
that
the
test
we
have
proposed
which
focuses
on
actual
or
constructive
possession
has
the
benefit
of
being
easy
to
apply
in
the
various
different
and
unpredictable
situations
in
which
this
issue
is
likely
to
arise.
now,
as
applied
in
this
case,
this
definition
of
agency
records
yields
a
clear
result.
the
ugdp
raw
data
that
petitioners
have
sought
are
not
now
and
have
never
been
in
the
possession
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
or
any
other
federal
agency.
as
the
district
court
found,
the
data
had
at
all
times
since
their
creation
been
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
ugdp,
which
is
a
private
research
group.
in
light
of
these
undisputed
findings,
we
think
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
data
are
not
agency
records
within
552(a)3
and
(a)4
of
title
5,
and
that
they
need
not
be
produced
to
petitioners
under
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
as
to
the
right
of
access,
petitioners
make
it
seem
as
if
the
nih
or
the
fda
have
an
unlimited
and
unrestricted
right
of
access.
as
i
hope
to
discuss
a
little
later,
this
is
untrue.
the
right
of
access,
we
believe
and
in
the
affidavit
of
dr.
whedon
in
the
record
supports,
is
only
a
right
of
access
for
purposes
of
the
grant;
it
is
not
an
unlimited
right
of
access.
the
fda
has
exercised
that
right
of
access,
as
petitioners
pointed
out,
and
in
conducting
its
audit,
some
of
the
raw
data
of
the
ugdp
project
did
come
into
fda's
possession.
it
was
brought
back
from
baltimore
to
the
nih
headquarters
in
rockville.
all
of
that
data
has
been
turned
over
to
petitioners.
so,
we
are
not
talking
here
about
any
data
that
ever
came
into
the
government's
possession
and
control,
because
that's
all
been
made
available
to
the
petitioners.
so,
your
answer,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
yes,
if
the
grant
allowed
it
and
the
access
regulations
approved
of
it,
the
government
could
make
copies,
and
at
that
point
they
may
well
be
agency
records.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
because
every
document
of
that
sort
that
was
actually
copied
and
brought
back
into
the
nih's
possession
was
made
available
to
petitioners.
now,
the
problem
that
we
see
with
petitioner's
contrary
theory
of
the
agency
records
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
that
there
is
really
no
theory
at
all.
petitioner's
submission,
although
obviously
designed
to
convince
the
court
that
they
should
be
given
access
to
the
ugdp
data
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
based
on
no
principle
standards
for
determining
when
documents
in
general
are
agency
records.
therefore,
offers
this
court
virtually
no
guidance
in
deciding
when
any
of
the
literally
billions
of
documents
in
the
hands
of
private
groups
that
deal
with
or
receive
money
from
the
federal
government
should
be
considered
agency
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
let
me
explain
what
i
mean.
petitioners
have
never
claimed
that
the
ugdp
itself
is
a
federal
agency
under
the
foia
and
any
such
claim
would
be
totally
untenable.
agency
is
a
defined
term
under
the
act
and
the
ugdp,
which
is
an
organization
of
private
and
state
university
medical
research
groups
working
at
private
and
state
institutions
clearly
does
not
satisfy
the
statutory
definition
of
agency.
what
petitioners
have
instead
contended
in
this
litigation
is
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
is
the
relevant
agency
under
the
foia,
and
then
they
have
attempted
to
argue
that
the
raw
data
in
the
hands
of
the
ugdp
are
agency
records
of
hew
by
emphasizing
every
conceivable
connection
between
the
data
in
any
branch
or
agency
of
hew.
they
specifically
rely
on
three
main
factors.
first,
they
claim
that
the
national
institute
of
arthritis,
metabolism,
and
digestive
disorders,
which
is
a
part
of
the
public
health
service
within
hew
was
significantly
involved
in
the
design,
implementation
and
funding
of
the
ugdp
study
that
led
to
the
raw
data.
second,
they
claim
that
niamdd
enjoys
an
absolute
right
of
access
to
the
ugdp
data
under
its
grant
regulations.
and
third,
they
claim
that
the
food
and
drug
administration,
which
is
a
separate
agency
within
hew,
has
taken
the
ugdp
data
into
account
for
the
purposes
of
regulatory
decision-making.
according
to
petitioners,
it
is
the
combination
of
these
three
factors
that
somehow
turns
the
ugdp
data
which
unquestionably
are
owned,
they
concede,
possessed
and
controlled
by
a
private
organization,
into
hew
agency
records,
that
must
be
turned
over
to
any
person.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
to
our
main
theory,
which
is
that
only
documents
in
the
possession
and
control,
not
documents
that
they
may
have
a
right
to
go
out
and
get,
are
within
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
want
to
concede
that
if
it
were
to
happen
in
the
future
they
would
necessarily
be
agency
records,
because
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
a
federal
record
under
the
nih
record
management
plan,
but
i
have
said,
and
this
is
true,
that
every
part
of
the
ugdp
data
that
is
ever
come
into
niamdd's
or
fda's
possession
in
the
past
has
been
turned
over
to
petitioners,
or
presumably
any
other
foia
requester.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
would
not.
i
would
not
concede
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
in
that
case
you
have
possession
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government.
that
is
why
we
think
the
control
test
may
be
relevant.
it
is
not
relevant
in
this
case
because
the
government
has
never
had
possession
or
control
of
any
of
the
documents
at
issue.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
and
the
control
--
you
know,
this
case
raises
a
number
of
interesting
questions
about
what
is
an
agency
record,
and
we
presented
a
definition
of
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
this
is,
i
think,
a
very
easy
case
for
the
court
because
no
organ
of
the
government
has
ever
had
possession
or
control.
now,
there
may
be
more
difficult
questions
coming
along
in
which
the
government
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
they
were
not
in
government's
possession
at
the
time
the
foia
request
came
in,
we
would
think
they
would
not
be
agency
records,
because
we
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
do
not
think
that
property
concepts
had
much
of
a
role
to
play
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
ownership
--
i
think
the
only
bundle
of
the
rights
that
ownership
gives
you
that
is
relevant
in
this
case
is
whether
you
have
an
undisputed
right
to
divulge
it
to
somebody
else.
presumably
if
you
own
documents
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
think
that
the
words
"make
available"
and
"withhold,"
which
are
in
552(a)
–
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
really
would
not
matter
in
any
practical
sense,
because
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
all
the
court
need
to
say
is
that
if
an
agency
does
not
have
possession
at
the
time
of
the
foia
request
comes
in
then
the
document
that
is
being
asked
for
need
not
be
produced,
whether
you
say
it
is
an
agency
record
or
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
there
would
not
be
agency
records
for
purposes
of
the
foia.
for
other
purposes
they,
of
course,
would
be,
for
records
disposal
act
purposes
or
federal
records
act.
we
are
just
dealing
here,
of
course,
with
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
because
the
agency
warehouse
situation
is
a
case
where
the
government
does
have
possession.
it
is
a
constructive
possession.
you
can
go
and
get
it
any
time
it
wants.
there
is
no
one
else
with
a
claim
to
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
correct.
you
could
not
say
the
government
is
withholding
something
if
it
cannot
turn
it
over
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
is
important,
though,
to
realize
we
are
talking
about
agency
records
for
foia
purposes,
and
the
definition
exists
in
the
same
sentence
with
the
words
"withhold"
and
"make
available."
we
think
they
give
meaning
to
what
congress
meant
by
the
words
"agency
records."
we
believe
that
the
court
should
reject
the
essentially
standardless
approach
to
the
definition
of
"agency
records"
that
petitioners
offer.
as
i
have
already
mentioned,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
itself
or
in
its
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
it
to
reach
papers
or
other
materials
in
private
hands.
perhaps
more
importantly,
petitioner's
approach
would
lead
to
more
problems
than
it
could
possibly
solve,
because
unless
the
exception
carved
in
the
foia
at
petitioner's
behest
were
to
be
limited
to
the
ugdp
documents
alone
or
to
other
private
documents
that
were
produced
under
the
circumstances
virtually
identical
to
the
ugdp
data,
in
other
words
all
the
four
factors
they
rely
on
existed.
it
would
be
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
identify
limiting
criteria
in
order
to
prevent
literally
billions
of
other
private
documents
from
falling
within
the
disclosure
requirements
of
the
act.
now,
petitioners,
as
i
have
noted,
have
stressed
three,
or
now
they
say
four
particular
factors
that
they
believe
make
the
private
ugdp
records
in
this
case
sufficiently
federal
to
require
their
release
under
the
foia,
but
some
of
these
factors
would
apply
equally
to
almost
every
meaningful
document
in
the
hands
of
a
private
group
that
receives
federal
funding.
and
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
there
were
over
16,000
government
research
grants
in
existence
in
1978
and
that
all
federal
grants
of
one
sort
or
another
accounted
for
nearly
one-fifth
of
the
federal
government's
budget
outlays
that
year.
in
other
words,
by
making
the
producibility
of
a
document
in
private
hands
turn
on
a
balancing
of
an
unknown
number
of
variables,
including
such
subjective
considerations
as
the
substantiality
of
the
federal
agency's
funding
or
monitoring
of
the
private
project
that
produced
the
records,
or
the
scope
of
the
granting
agency's
access
rights
to
the
records,
or
the
degree
of
the
agency's
reliance
on
the
final
report
prepared
by
the
grantee
through
the
use
of
the
records
–
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
presumably
the
agency
has
no
other
copies?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
would
still
maintain
that
for
foia
purposes,
it
is
not
an
agency
record.
but
as
i
say,
the
same
result
would,
you
would
reach
the
same
result
you
could
not
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
the
way
we
would
think
congress
meant
by
using
the
words
"withhold"
and
"make
available"
agency
records.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
act
requires
federal
agencies
to
make
available
and
not
to
withhold
a
category
of
documents
called
agency
records,
and
i
think
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
is
something
you
cannot
turn
over,
then
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
am
certain
that
that
is
what
would
happen
in
practice,
but
i
was
attempting
to
address
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
that
in
fact
--
that
is
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
that
situation
would
ever
in
practice
to
arise,
the
chief
justice
is
right,
we
would
send
a
letter
saying
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
might
arise,
also.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
only
we
are
not
talking
about
agency
records
for
foia
purposes,
for
turning
it
over
to
the
public
at
large,
not
for
other
purposes.
thank
you.
