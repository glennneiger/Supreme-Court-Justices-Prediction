mr.
thomas
e.
plank
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
believe
that
congress
never
intended
the
federal
freedom
of
information
act
to
apply
to
the
records
of
private
citizens
and
private
and
state
institutions
that
receive
federal
grants,
and
also
why
the
act
should
not
be
extended
to
such
records.
first,
such
extension
of
the
federal
freedom
of
information
act
would
be
contrary
to
the
very
basic
premise
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
which
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
know
what
their
government
is
doing.
the
second
reason
is
that
such
an
extension
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
the
records
of
grant
recipients
would
significantly
alter
the
basic
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
grant
recipients.
third,
the
application
of
the
act
to
the
records
of
such
grant
recipients,
such
as
the
university
records
of
the
university
group
diabetes
program,
would
have
a
staggering
adverse
impact
upon
grant
recipients
whether
they
be
researchers
or
whether
they
be
state
and
local
governments.
before
i
discuss
these
points
further,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
some
of
the
points
that
were
made
earlier.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
record
is
very
clear
in
this
case
that
not
only
did
only
the
ugdp
have
possession
of
the
records,
but
they
had
control
of
the
records.
the
district
court
so
found,
and
dr.
whedon's
affidavit
at
page
147
of
the
appendix
clearly
sets
forth
that
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
university
group
was
in
the
hands
of
the
university
group
and
not
the
national
institutes
of
health
or
any
other
agency
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
also
helpful
to
remember
what
are
not
issues
in
this
case.
the
validity
of
the
findings
of
the
university
group
study
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
propriety
of
the
proposed
changes
in
the
labeling
of
oral
hypoglycemic
drugs
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
neither
is
the
propriety
of
the
reliance
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
upon
the
findings
of
the
university
group
study.
similarly,
the
issue
of
whether
the
university
group
records
ought
to
be
released
to
the
public
at
some
time
in
the
future
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
here
is
whether
individuals
and
private
and
state
institutions
that
receive
federal
grants
but
otherwise
retain
their
independence
and
autonomy,
or
in
the
case
of
a
state
or
local
government,
their
sovereignty,
the
right
of
those
individuals
to
determine
when,
to
what
extent,
and
under
what
circumstances
their
records
will
be
revealed
to
the
public.
mr.
thomas
e.
plank
yes,
your
honor.
let
us
say
if
the
federal
government
in
some
way
interferes
with
the
independence
of
the
that
may
be
relevant.
one
of
the
important
principles
that
is
recognized
in
our
society
is
the
right
of
individuals
and
private
and
state
entities
to
pursue
their
own
goals
with
a
minimum
of
interference
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
e.
plank
well,
i
think
the
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is,
there
is
of
course
a
certain
amount
of
interference
entailed
in
a
federal
grant,
but
the
purpose
of
the
federal
grant
is
not
to
interfere
with
or
to
direct
the
subject
matter
of
the
research.
mr.
thomas
e.
plank
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
and
in
the
cases
of
most
federal
grants,
the
purpose
is
to
support
and
to
assist
these
institutions
and
entities
as
they
pursue
their
own
goals.
mr.
thomas
e.
plank
i
believe
the
congress
perhaps
could,
if
it
wanted
to
define
agency
records
to
include
the
records
of
grantees.
i
think
they
could
make
that
definition.
in
this
case
they
have
not.
mr.
thomas
e.
plank
that
is
also
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
point
is
here
that
any
time
the
congress
has
circumscribed
the
freedom
of
a
grant
recipient
to
take
action.
grant
recipients
may
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
may
not
discriminate
against
the
handicapped.
congress
has
specifically
so
provided,
either
in
the
enabling
legislation
for
the
grant
or
in
another
act.
in
this
case,
congress
has
not
stated
that
the
records
of
grant
recipients
are
federal
agency
records,
and
i
think
that
that
fact
in
itself
is
conclusive.
in
addition,
the
fact
of
the
staggering
impact
that
the
extension
of
the
act
would
have
upon
conducting
research
and
the
federal
program
of
supporting
research
suggests
very
strongly
that
congress
would
not
and
did
not
intend
the
act
to
apply
to
these
records
simply
because
they
did
not
address
these
policy
issues.
these
policy
issues
are
substantial,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
and
congress
at
the
very
least,
if
they
had
wanted
to
do
this
and
had
intended
to
do
this,
would
have
discussed
those
policy
questions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
