if
we
should
agree
with
you
on
the
first
premise,
that
they
were
wrong
in
believing
that
federal
common
law
was
applicable,
i
suppose
the
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
this
court
would
then
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
pennsylvania
courts
for
them
to
decide
it
under
state
law,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
we
agree
with
the
pennsylvania
courts
that
federal
common
law
is
what
is
governing
here,
then
we
would
proceed
to
decide
whether
or
not
we
agree
with
them
as
to
what
the
federal
common
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be
no
remand,
would
there?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
there
would
be
a
remand
but
if
we
agree
with
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
that
federal
common
law
is
applicable
and
that
it
grants
the
kind
of
immunity
that
pennsylvania
believed
it
did,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
akin
to
this
case
in
that
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
done
what
with
that
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
not
decide
it.
justice
potter
stewart
where,
in
the
court
of
common
pleas?
or
has
it
gone
beyond
that?
justice
potter
stewart
on
some
sort
of
an
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
question
is
now
pending.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
was
an
appointed
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
a
public
defender
in
a
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
question
would
be
one
of
congressional
power,
under
the
constitution,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
under
which
one
of
this
constitutional
powers?
justice
potter
stewart
this
part
of
your
argument,
at
this
stage
in
your
argument,
you
are
assuming
that
you
lose
on
the
--
and
that
federal
common
law
is
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes,
yes.
but
now
you
are
assuming
that
your
first
argument,
that
federal
common
law
is
inapplicable,
has
been
rejected
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
now
you
are
arguing
that
the
federal
common
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
arness,
you
told
us
earlier
that
there
were
three
reasons
and
you
gave
one
and
then
we
hardly
gave
you
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
other
two.
have
you
now
given
them
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
the
2255
and
the
disciplinary.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
not
suggest
it?
you
would
not
suggest
there
would
be
absolute
immunity
there,
would
you?
