justice
william
h.
rehnquist
howard
against
lyons
was
a
diversity
action,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
it
was
in
the
federal
courts
but
they
were
required
to
apply
either
some
sort
of
federal
common
law
privilege
or
the
law
of
the
state
applicability.
it
was
not
brought
under
any
federal
basis
of
jurisdiction
other
than
publicity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
pennsylvania
rule,
if
it
is
a
state
law
rule,
would
not
be
binding,
i
suppose,
in
a
1983
action
against
this
lawyer
whom
you
refer
that
it
is
presently
pending
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
your
position,
then,
that
pennsylvania
could
go
either
way
as
to
immunity
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
a
case
from
this
court,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
arness
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
case
where
a
defendant
chooses
to
exercise
the
constitutional
right
that
the
feretta
case
accorded
him
and
decides
to
represent
himself
and
the
court
appoints
stand-by
counsel?
is
that
stand-by
counsel
immune
from
later
suit
by
the
defendant
who
elected
to
go
pro
se?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
think
that
he
is
performing
a
governmental
function?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
are
they
constitutionally
entitled
under
ferretta
to
have
stand-by
counsel?
