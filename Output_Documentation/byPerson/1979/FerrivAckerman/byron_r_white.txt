justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
this
involved
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
an
employee
as
a
public
defender?
in
some
districts
they
take
care
of
the
constitutional
right
of
defendants
by
having
a
public
defender's
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
a
public
defender?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
employee
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
case
let
us
assume
that
the
public
defender,
an
employee
of
the
united
state,
did
such
a
bad
job
of
representing
the
defendant
who
was
convicted
that
his
conviction
was
reversed
because
of
--
that
he
had
inadequate
counsel.
it
was
so
bad
that
a
conviction
was
reversed,
that
the
defendant
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
and
then
the
defendant
sued
the
counsel
who
had
been
representing
him
for
--
to
recover
under
a
bivens
type
of
action.
what
would
you
say
then?
would
not
that
be
a
federal
issue
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if
you
agree
that
federal
law
would
govern
the
public
defender,
do
you
think
that
the
rule
would
apply
to
his
colleague
who
was
just
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
could
change
that
a
little
bit,
could
congress
by
statute
grant
absolute
immunity
to
a
criminal
justice
act-appointed
counsel
and
public
defenders
and
do
so
consistently
with
the
constitution,
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
true
that
you
can
talk
that
way
about
congress
but
if
you
talk
about
the
united
states,
the
interest
of
the
united
states
is
broader.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
horizon
of
the
constitution.
it
is
doing
its
constitutional
duty
to
appoint
counsel
and
it
is
a
federal
--
it
certainly
is
a
federal
function
and
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
whether
or
not
the
counsel
has
performed
his
duty
in
the
federal
court
adequately
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
sure
it
would
be
if
the
defendant
appealed
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
such
inadequate
counsel
that
his
conviction
should
be
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
congress
could
not
prescribe
the
standards
for
lawyers
who
were
operating
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
including
those
who
were
appointed
to
represent
indigents.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
providing
for
liability
if
they
breach
those
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
understanding
about
the
obligation
of
an
attorney
in
your
state
or
in
your
district
to
respond
to
an
appointment?
is,
i
suppose
--
would
a
judge
hold
a
person
in
contempt
if
he
declined
to
represent
a
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyone
who
wants
out
can
get
out
in
your
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
so
he
is
voluntarily
walking
into
a
situation
that
--
well,
at
least
he
is
not
involuntary.
he
is
not
performing
some
involuntary
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
volunteers
he
then
at
least
purports
to
be
competent
to
accept
and
discharge
an
appointment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
it
is
not
a
situation
where
he
says,
"judge,
i
just
am
not
a
criminal
lawyer.
i
do
not
know
anything
about
it.
i
do
not
want
to
do
it."
he
is
not
forced
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
purports
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
eule,
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law,
what
sort
of
immunity
does
a
judge
and
a
prosecutor
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
supposing
you
are
counsel
for
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
in
a
federal
court
and
you
are
suing
the
lawyer
who
represented
him
in
the
federal
court
and
you
are
suing
him
under
state
law
just
like
in
this
action
and
he
raises
a
defense
of
immunity
under
state
law.
i
take
it
you
would
not
have
to
strike
that
defense
as
wholly
improper.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
not
be
the
federal
court.
you
are
suing
him
in
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
arness?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions
about
the
first
branch
of
your
adversary's
argument?
it
is
the
question
of
the
source
of
this
rule
and
why
it
is
a
federal
rule.
you
do
not
contend
the
rule
itself
is
constitutionally
required,
do
you?
the
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
contend
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
not
contend
that
it
sources
any
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a
federal
common
law
rule
on
which
you
rely.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
it
is
a
federal
common
law
rule
independent
of
statute,
would
it
have
applied
to
court-appointed
counsel
before
the
money
was
appropriated
to
pay
him,
you
know,
a
lot
of
us
used
to
do
this
sort
of
work
without
any
money.
would
immunity
have
been
available
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
criminal
justice
act
pays
these
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
rule,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
is
all
irrelevant
to
the
rule.
that
is
not
the
source
of
the
rule
that
you
advocate.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
the
same
right
to
immunity
if
you
were
appointed
by
a
local
bar
association
pursuant
to
some
committee
procedure
or
something
like
that
and
everybody
worked
free,
to
defend
defendants
in
criminal
cases
because
it
helped
the
system
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
but
supposing
instead
of
being
appointed
under
the
federal
criminal
justice
act
the
philadelphia
bar
association
where
they
had
a
committee
that
young
lawyers
did
this
on
a
volunteer
basis
and
they
appointed
such
a
lawyer
to
defend
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
would
such
a
lawyer
be
entitled
to
the
immunity
under
the
rule
that
you
are
advocating
that
we
should
recognize?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
all
you
have
got
going
for
you,
isn't
it?
there
are
no
statutes
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
arness,
i
take
it
from
the
briefs
that
neither
you
nor
your
opponents
think
that
barr
against
matteo
has
any
bearing
in
the
case.
am
i
correct
in
that
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
"superseded,"
you
mean
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
--
you
are
not
--
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
any
violation
of
constitutional
right.
it
is
just
a
state
negligence
action
and
i
don't
know
why
barr
would
not
--
if
the
federal
law
governs
this
i
would
not
know
why
barr
would
not
be
perfectly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
big
problem
is
that
federal
law
controls
and
that
pennsylvania
law
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
suppose
that
a
federal
defendant
is
convicted
and
he
claims
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated
by
the
inadequate
performance
of
his
counsel
and
his
conviction
is
affirmed,
his
claim
is
rejected
because
in
that
court
the
standard
for
performance
is
a
mockery
or
a
farce.
is
that
still
a
standard
in
the
third
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
the
standard
in
the
federal
courts
is
farce
or
mockery
and
that
the
lawyer's
performance
was
within
that.
then
the
defendant
who
was
convicted
turns
around
and
sues
under
state
law
and
he
says,
well,
it
may
be
that
you
satisfied
your
obligations
under
the
federal
constitution
but
the
state
is
entitled
to
require
you,
to
hold
you
to
a
higher
standard,
namely,
just
negligence.
and
you
were
negligent.
now,
you
are
saying
that
he
has
no
right
to
go
into
state
court
to
make
that
sort
of
a
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
saying
that
he
would
have
an
immunity
defense
to
any
state
law
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
state
is
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
possible
reason
--
what
are
the
reasons
for
affording
immunity?
absolute
or
qualified?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason
is
that
you
do
not
want
to
deter,
by
a
fear
of
liability,
any
of
the
performance
of
the
officer's
duty.
now,
a
prosecutor,
you
want
him
to
be
fearless.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
just
apply
that
to
a
defense
counsel.
now,
how
could
he
possibly
be
deferred
from
doing
anything
by
fear
of
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
involuntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wait
a
minute.
did
you
say
that
if
he
went
to
the
judge
and
said,
"i
just
can't
handle
this,"
he
could
not
get
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless
he
has
held
himself
out
as
being
a
competent
lawyer,
competent
enough
to
represent
defendants
in
criminal
cases
by
volunteering.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
well,
go
ahead,
tell
me
why
he
is
entitled
to
immunity,
what
would
he
be
deterred
from
doing
if
he
did
not
have
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
that
differ
from
hired
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
he
might
be
tempted
to
follow
his
client's
requests
and
orders
when,
if
he
were
hired
counsel,
he
would
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
follows
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
suppose
he
does
follow
his
client's
directions
where
otherwise
he
would
not?
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
actual
fear
of
liability,
damages
liability,
would
deter?
because
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
about,
as
brother
stevens
says,
these
complaints
before
bar
associations
and
surely
in
the
federal
court
itself
if
the
defendant
is
so-minded
he
can
claim
that
he
was
inadequately
represented
and
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed
and
i
suppose
that
he
could,
if
--
let's
assume
he
appealed
and
his
conviction
was
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
his
counsel
has
inadequately
represented
him
and
had
violated
his
constitutional
right.
i
suppose
the
defendant
could
turn
around
and
sue
him
in
the
federal
court
in
a
bivens-type
action
for
violating
his
right
to
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
do
away
with
his
lawsuit,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
do
away
with
his
damages
and
his
lawsuit,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
arness,
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
states
there's
a
rule
in
cases
like
this
that
the
criminal
defendant
in
order
to
recover
in
a
malpractice
action
has
to
prove
that
he
was
innocent?
i
think
that
some
states
require
that
to
show
actual
harm.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
pretty
large
proportion
of
these
cases
where
the
plaintiff
in
the
malpractice
action
could
never
carry
that
burden
of
proof,
as
a
practical
matter?
