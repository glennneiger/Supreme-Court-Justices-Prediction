mr.
john
p.
arness
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
immunity
would
best
serve
the
private
interests
of
an
indigent
defendant
or
whether
immunity
would
best
serve
the
private
interests
of
a
court-appointed
attorney
but
rather
whether
the
doctrine
of
immunity
would
best
serve
the
public
interest,
particularly
in
insuring
the
proper
function
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
we
contend
that
the
considerations
found
determinative
in
this
court's
prior
decisions
are
fully
applicable
to
this
case.
these
include
the
fact
that
the
threat
of
litigation
may
influence
the
manner
in
which
the
person
involved
performs
his
duty.
the
fact
of
litigation
will
inflict
harassment
upon
such
persons
so
as
to
deflect
their
energies
from
the
duties
which
they
are
obliged
to
perform
in
order
to
analyze
and
meet
the
charges
with
which
they
will
be
faced.
the
threat
of
litigation
would
make
service
in
an
already-burdened
system
less
attractive
and
make
it
more
difficult
to
encourage
well-motivated
and
competent
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
because
that
same
theory
or
same
set
of
situations
could
govern
almost
all
of
the
activity
of
the
appointed
attorney
and
if
he
had
to
guard
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
but
whether
or
not
to
plead
the
statute
of
limitations
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
what
this
case
is.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
correct
but
it
is
no
more
blatant,
your
honor,
than
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
no,
the
20
years,
your
honor,
was
for
putting
a
bomb
in
a
car
and
injuring
someone.
the
10
years
on
top
of
that
was
with
reference
to
the
internal
revenue
count.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes
and
he
has
now
filed
a
motion
under
2255,
as
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner
has
shown,
which
is
perfectly
capable
of
curing
that
error,
if,
indeed,
it
be
error.
you
know,
the
statute
of
limitations,
your
honor,
if
i
may
digress
for
just
a
moment,
is
not
just
the
responsibility
of
counsel.
but
the
united
states
attorney
indicted,
apparently.
the
judge
did
not
pick
it
up.
mr.
john
p.
arness
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
and
we
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes
and
your
honor,
you
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
in
that
context,
certainly,
your
honor,
it
is.
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
criminal
justice
act
and
the
system
is
not
well-served
by
permitting
just
anyone
to
sue
anyone
who
is
an
integral
performing
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process.
there
are
much
better
means
of
handling
that
situation,
both
for
the
indigent
defendant
involved
and
for
the
public.
now,
the
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
this
court
has
never
been
dissuaded
from
handling
the
policy
considerations
involved
by
the
particular
conduct.
if
it
were,
then
the
suppression
of
evidence
by
mr.
pachtman
would
not
have
been
tolerated
and
in
the
imbler
case
there
would
not
have
been
declared
absolute
immunity.
you
cannot,
we
respectfully
submit,
handle
cases
that
have
such
far-reaching
policy
considerations
behind
them
on
the
basis
of
the
particular
conduct
being
charged
in
a
particular
case
and
whether
or
not
this
conduct
was
reprehensible,
of
course,
would
be
decided
on
a
trial
of
the
merits
and
we
do
not
know
that
but
that
is
not
before
the
court.
the
problem
before
the
court
is
whether
public
policy
requires
the
doctrine
of
immunity
to
be
available
so
as
not
to
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
function
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
john
p.
arness
if
malpractice
suits
are
to
be
permitted,
any
grounds
which
would
smack
of
a
counsel
giving
improper
advice
would
be
grounds
for
that
action
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
you
would
have
to
prove
it,
of
course,
under
the
standards.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
difference
is
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
two
important
distinctions,
however;
the
paid
counsel
does
not
have
an
involuntary
relationship
where
the
threat
of
litigation
is
as
real
as
it
is
in
an
involuntary
relationship
such
as
court-appointed
counsel
has.
secondly,
the
private
attorney
is
not
performing
a
governmental
function.
now,
it
is
because
this
court
in
johnson
versus
serbst
and
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
then
congress
has
enacted
the
civil
criminal
justice
act
--
has
made
this
function
a
governmental
function.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
my
answer
would
be,
your
honor,
that
court
has
said
that
that
is
a
constitutional
right.
congress
could
have
said,
in
the
criminal
justice
act
that
all
people,
regardless
of
means,
are
entitled
to
free
appointed
counsel.
congress
did
not.
congress
chose
to
implement
the
decision
of
this
court
by
depriving
people
of
means
of
that
benefit
and
giving
it
only
to
people
who
can
show
that
they
cannot
afford
it.
that
is
a
legislative
decision.
mr.
john
p.
arness
it
does,
your
honor.
yes,
it
does
and
respondent
would
be
perfectly
happy
for
the
purpose
of
this
policy
argument
to
have
it
apply
across
the
board.
however,
we
maintain
that
it
is
the
performance
of
a
governmental
function
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
others
that
that
is
the
critical
area.
both
public
defenders
and
private
attorneys
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act
are
performing
a
governmental
function
as
the
criminal
justice
act
intended
they
perform
it.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
we
do
not.
mr.
john
p.
arness
we
contend
that
it
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
john
p.
arness
it
is
not
the
source
of
any
statute.
mr.
john
p.
arness
it
is
a
rule
based
upon
declared
public
policy,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
it
would.
once
this
court
declared
johnson
versus
zerbst--
mr.
john
p.
arness
--
that
that
be
a
function,
a
governmental
function,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
john
p.
arness
my
friend
has
argued
that
all
congress
did
was
provide
payment.
congress
did
not
do
that,
congress
implemented
a
system
or
designed
a
system
to
implement
this
court's
constitutional
ruling
of
providing
counsel.
now,
this
court
in
its
wisdom
left
to
congress
the
devising
of
the
means
to
accomplish
this
end.
congress
did
that.
congress
has
provided
for
a
mixed
system
of
public
defenders
and
private
lawyers
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act
to
perform
this
very
vital
public
service
and
we
are
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
--
that
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
the
federal
court
is
involved
because
this
attorney
was
appointed
under
the
federal
criminal
justice
act
in
performing
a
federal
governmental
function.
now,
i
would
think
the
public
policy
applicable
would
be
equally
applicable
to
a
state
lawyer.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
so,
on
the
basis
of
public
policy
but
i
believe
it
was
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
arness
we
have
going
for
us
the
public
policy
considerations
which
this
court
has
paid
attention
to
in
every
case
of
this
kind
that
has
been
before
the
court.
we
contend
that
they
are
identically
applicable
to
this
case
plus
we
have
this
court's
decision
in
the
criminal
justice
act
making
this
particular
function
a
federal
governmental
function
and
that
is
why
it
would
be
incongruous,
your
honors,
to
have
50
states
deciding,
on
their
own,
under
state
constitutions
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
--
whether
a
criminal
justice
act
attorney,
appointed
under
the
federal
act,
had
immunity
or
not.
there
has
to
be
a
federal
rule
on
that.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
john
p.
arness
we
think
barr
against
matteo
has
been
superseded
by
this
court's
decision
in
imbler
versus
pachtman
and
in
butz
versus
economou,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
no,
your
honor,
certain
parts
of
barr
versus
matteo,
we
contend,
are
still
good
law
in
problems
that
do
not
arise
to
the
dignity
of
constitutional
rights,
for
instance.
in
ordinary
questions
we
think
barr
versus
matteo
has
still
standing
under
the
constitution
and
there
should
be
absolute
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
the
two
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
yes.
your
honor,
that
certainly
is
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
here.
however,
we
think
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
applicability
of
federal
standards
because
it
is
the
administration
of
a
federal
statute
and
a
federal
governmental
function
that
is
involved
here.
mr.
john
p.
arness
if
he
is
performing
a
governmental
function
and
he
stays
within
the
scope
of
that
governmental
function,
your
honor,
we
respectfully
submit
that
he
has
absolute
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
arness
if
he
is
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act
to
perform
that
service
that
indigents
are
constitutionally
entitled
to,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
well,
i
think
the
reason
stand-by
counsel
is
appointed,
your
honor,
is
to
provide,
even
when
the
defendant
does
not
want
to
have
some
semblance
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
that
is
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
p.
arness
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
p.
arness
it
is
not,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
standing
is
everywhere.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
if
he
goes
into
a
state
court
and
it
is
shown
that
he
was
performing
a
federal
governmental
function,
his
rights
are
to
be
governed
by
the
public
policy
attendant
to
that
which
gives
him
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
john
p.
arness
because
he
--
the
liability
he
is
being
charged
with
arose
during
the
course
of
his
performance
of
a
federal
governmental
function.
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
other
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
ready
things
that
comes
to
mind
is,
if
his
involuntary
client
insists
that
he
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
he
voluntarily
becomes
a
criminal
justice
act
attorney
but
once
he
becomes
on
that
list
then
he
gets
an
appointment.
he
doesn't
choose
it
and
the
indigent
defendant
does
not
choose
him.
there
is
an
involuntary
relationship
created
by
the
very
essence
of
the
act.
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
the
standards
do
not
permit
him
to
get
out
just
because
he
does
not
like
the
situation.
that
is
correct.
and
the
standards
of
getting
out
or
substituting
or
withdrawing
are
very
difficult.
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
is
correct.
he
has
held
himself
out
to
be
competent.
any
lawyer
who
is
admitted
to
the
bar
and
practices
holds
himself
out
to
be
competent
in
the
things
he
undertakes
but
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
involuntary
relationship
created
so
as
to
distinguish
that
situation
from
the
situation
that
confronts
privately-retained
attorneys.
mr.
john
p.
arness
there
are
three
reasons.
his
judgment
would
necessarily
be
affected,
your
honor,
because
if
he
thought
that
a
certain
trial
tactic
was
in
the
best
interest
of
his
client
and
his
client
insisted
on
something
else,
then
he
is
put
in
an
untenable
position
of
either
acceding
to
the
client's
request
or
subjecting
himself
to
a
malpractice
action.
mr.
john
p.
arness
this
would
have
a
dampening
effect
on
his
representation.
mr.
john
p.
arness
hired
counsel,
because
of
the
voluntary
relationship
and
particularly
the
right
of
choice,
is
chosen
because
the
defendant
thinks
their
judgment
is
worth
having
and
they
are
paying
for
it
and
they
are
more
prone
to
follow
it
and
be
satisfied
with
it.
one
of
the
first
and
essential
requirements
of
handling
a
criminal
case
is
to
have
the
lawyer
in
charge
so
that
he
can
do
the
best
job
for
his
client.
now,
that
you
can
insist
on
in
a
private
relationship.
that
is
almost
impossible
in
an
involuntary
relationship
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
reasons
why
that
the
public
policy
demands
that
court-appointed
counsel
be
given
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
every
court
that
has
considered
this
problem,
that
we
know
of,
has
stated
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
john
p.
arness
what
follows
from
that
is
that
in
order
to
put
him
in
a
posture
where
he
can
effectively
represent
and
do
his
duty,
immunity
should
be
granted,
for
that
and
for
two
other
reasons.
mr.
john
p.
arness
if
he
follows
his
client's
directions,
that
is
the
path
of
the
easiest
way
out.
his
client
probably
is
not
well-served
but
he
maybe
dodges
a
malpractice
action
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
criminal
justice
act
should
not
do.
mr.
john
p.
arness
that
situation,
in
its
essence,
of
course
is
no
different,
your
honor.
but
it
is
almost
inevitable
that
it
will
occur
in
an
involuntary
relationship
where
it
should
not
occur
in
a
private
voluntary
relationship.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
because
the
privately-retained
attorney
can
say,
"if
you
do
not
want
my
advice,
then
here
is
your
money
and
you
can
get
another
lawyer."
mr.
john
p.
arness
well,
that
should
have
been
worked
out
long
before
the
middle
of
the
trial,
your
honor.
obviously,
there
can
occur
things
during
the
middle
of
a
trial
where
even
a
privately-retained
lawyer
could
have
a
disagreement
with
his
client.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
involuntary
relationship
increases
the
risk
and
hazard
of
litigation.
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
the
public
policy
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor
but
that
is
not
the
question.
the
public
policy
considerations
here
are
not
because
there
may
be
ultimate
liability
in
a
malpractice
suit.
we
would
presume
that
in
most
instances
a
malpractice
action,
because
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
it
is
not
well-calculated
to
serve
the
interests
--
would
not
be
availing.
the
public
interest
is
in
freeing
the
lawyer
from
having
to
go
through
and
prove
and
being
sued
and
spending
the
money
and
harassed
and
having
to
prove
that
his
judgment
was
correct
and
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
--
that
the
conviction
would
have
happened
anyway.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes
and
we
contend
respectfully
that
post-conviction
relief
procedures,
court
disciplinary
procedures,
bar
association
disciplinary
procedures
are
much
better-calculated
to
handle
the
situation
that
can
be
conjured
up.
malpractice,
because
of
the
burden
of
proof
requirements,
because
of
the
defenses
that
are
available
and
because
of
the
fact
that
2255
relief
is
a
concomitant
of
the
thing
where
you
could
well
have
a
court
rule
that
there
be
a
requirement
to
exhaust
judicial
remedies
and
then
you
would
have
collateral
estoppel
problems.
malpractice
is
really
not
well-designed
to
get
at
the
problem
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
which
is
the
competency
of
counsel.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
no.
those
are
important
considerations
but
the
other
two
are
these,
your
honor.
this
court
has
held
that
the
reason
for
immunity
of
the
public
policy
is
to
prevent
harassment
--
i
have
talked
about
that
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
and
secondly,
the
recruiting
problem.
it
is
absolutely
essential
for
the
proper
functioning
of
the
criminal
justice
system
to
draw
well-meaning
and
competent
counsel
into
this.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
such
as
it
is,
with
the
criminal
justice
act,
it
is
apparent
that
congress
wanted
the
participation
of
the
private
bar.
now,
that
participation
is
something
that
is
necessary
unless
we
are
going
to
have
a
system
where
all
defense
is
provided
of
public
defender
systems,
which
would
not
be
a
good
thing
and
this,
as
i
say,
the
recruiting
element
has
been
discussed
in
most
of
the
cases
that
have
considered
the
immunity
and
we
think
it
is
a
real
concern.
and
those
are
the
other
two.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor,
he
could
but
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
bivens
situation
is
applicable
here.
that
was
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
that
would
not
be
within
the
scope
of
the
duty
of
a
court-appointed
attorney.
your
honor,
the
2255
relief
which
this
very
petitioner
could
have
filed
more
than
two
years
ago
has
just
been
filed
in
the
month
of
september.
why?
the
record
is
silent.
but
that
relief
is
much
more
appropriate
and
that
will
do
away
completely
with
the
10-year
sentence
that
he
is
complaining
about
here
if,
indeed
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
pardon?
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
it
would
render
this
case
moot
and
probably
--
either
that
or
it
would
probably
grant
him
certiorari.
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
that
should
be
done
by
courts
and
by
bar
associations
disciplinary
procedures.
mr.
john
p.
arness
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
can
only
argue
immunity
on
the
basis
of
governmental
function,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
malpractice
is--as
a
form
of
civil
relief--is
fine
when
a
governmental
function
is
not
involved,
and
when
public
policy
does
not
contraindicate
it.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
do
not.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
hope
so,
your
honor.
i
hope
it's
ingrained
in
my
mind.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
do
not
know,
but
i
assume
it
would
be
high.
but
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
whether
lawyers
should
have
better
malpractice
coverage.
that--it
isn't
the
threat
of
ultimate
financial
liability.
it's
the
threat
of
the
harassment--
mr.
john
p.
arness
no,
and
i
don't
give
it
away
too
quickly,
your
honor.
all
i
say
is
that
malpractice
can
cover
that
threat.
mr.
john
p.
arness
if
you
can
afford
it,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
arness
yes.
and
it's
certainly
a
meaningful
factor.
but
far
more
meaningful
is
that
there
are
alternate
ways
to
get
at
this
problem
which
cannot
be
protected
against,
and
which
the
court
can
control.
mr.
john
p.
arness
your
honor,
i
think
the
substantial
weight
and
the
authority
requires
that
in
a
malpractice
action.
and
one
of
the
ills,
of
course,
is
the
thought
of
trying
a
criminal
action
over
again
in
a
civil
environment
with
a
lay
jury
is
something
public
policy
again
should
not
countenance.
mr.
john
p.
arness
i
think
it
would
be
very,
very
difficult,
your
honor.
i
see
my
white
light
is
on.
i'd
like
to
close,
your
honor,
by
stating
that
it's
respondent's
position
here
in
this
case,
that
the
public
policy
considerations
which
this
court
has
applied,
and
every
federal
court--we
do
not
know
of
a
single
federal
appellate
decision
that
has
ever
refused
to
grant
a
governmental
function
immunity.
thank
you.
