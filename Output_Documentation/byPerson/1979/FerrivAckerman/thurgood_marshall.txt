justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
government
does
not
give
medicaid
funds
pursuant
to
the
united
states
constitution,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yet
in
this
case,
all
this
case
tells
the
defense
counsel
is,
"be
sure
and
raise
your
defenses."
is
that
what
this
case
tells
us?
and
my
second
question,
if
so,
how
does
that
hurt
due
process
of
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know
how
many
appointed
attorneys
run
up
against
the
statute.
not
many,
i
am
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
this
case
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
cannot
read
that
out
of
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
man
is
serving
20
years
because
of
what
this
man
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
wrong
on
10
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
got
10
years.
that
is
a
long
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
cannot
sue
the
united
states
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
sue
the
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
you
can't
--
so
in
a
situation
where
the
judge
is
asleep,
the
u.s.
attorney
is
asleep
and
the
defense
counsel
is
asleep,
you
have
got
10
years
coming.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
this
case
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
not
that
true
today?
is
it
not
true
that
despite
this
case
that
if
it
is
paid
counsel
that
is
possible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
all
this
hypothetical,
if
it
is
paid
counsel,
you
can
try
them
for
malpractice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
away
from
50
states
to
one
state,
pennsylvania.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
two
defendants,
hypothetical.
one
is
paid
for
and
one
is
court-appointed
and
they
both
pay
no
attention
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
paid
one
gets
sued
and
the
appointed
one
cannot
be
sued.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
having
rendered
his
case
moot,
how
would
it
stop
the
man
from
having
done
the
wrong
that
he
allegedly
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
have
malpractice
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
malpractice
on
one
but
not
the
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
support
malpractice
for
private
attorneys?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
is
fine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
consider
a
private
attorney
as
performing
a
governmental
function?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ever
read
the
oath
that
you
took?
