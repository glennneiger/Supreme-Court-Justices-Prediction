is
it
your
position
--
you
do
not
really
contend
that
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
the
judge
owes
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
any
duty
at
all?
you
do
not
contend
that,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
are
some
constraints
on
counsel
representing
a
client,
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
arness,
i
question
the
basic
premise
on
which
you
are
arguing.
you
are
suggesting
a
situation
in
which
a
lawyer
in
his
professional
judgment
thinks
he
should
do
a
and
the
client
says,
"i
would
rather
have
you
do
b"
and
the
lawyer
thinks
it
would
be
stupid
to
do
b
so
he
does
b
anyway
to
protect
himself
form
a
suit.
i
submit
he
is
more
likely
to
be
guilty
of
malpractice
if
he
follows
the
stupid
request
of
his
client
and
does
not
follow
his
own
professional
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
a
defense
to
a
malpractice
suit
to
say
that
"my
client
asked
me
to
do
this
stupid
thing."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
arness,
one
of
the
costs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
the
costs
of
taking
on
cases
like
this
is
exposure
to
the
risks
of
complaints
before
the
ethics
committee,
the
bar
association,
malpractice
suits,
all
these
sorts
of
things.
there
are
these
complaints
that
are
going
to
be
filed
against
lawyers
who
take
no
this
litigation,
no
matter
what
the
rules
are.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
arness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show,
or
do
you
happen
to
know,
what
an
individual
officer
of
the
court
would
have
to
pay
as
a
premium
for
malpractice
insurance
now,
assuming
he
were
regularly
defending
criminal
defendants
pursuant
to
appointment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
give
that
point
away
so
quickly,
if
you
were
a
sole
practitioner,
didn't
have
a
law
firm
to
provide
malpractice
insurance,
would
you
rush
to
volunteer
to
defend
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
have
the
funds--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doctors,
i
understand,
are
paying,
$20-,
$25,000
a
year
premium.
