justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
federal
crime
and
thereafter
brought
a
suit
against
his
lawyer
claiming
that
the
lawyer
had
been
guilty
of
malpractice
in
defending
him
in
the
criminal
trial.
the
lawyer
who
had
been
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
from
tort
liability.
the
pennsylvania
courts
upheld
this
defense.
in
its
opinion,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
explained
that
it
believe
that
federal
law
required
it
to
a
court
absolute
immunity
to
defense
counsel
appointed
pursuant
to
the
federal
statute.
we
disagree.
we
hold
that
federal
law
is
not
controlling
and
that
pennsylvania
may
decide
for
itself
whether
the
defense
of
immunity
should
be
recognized
by
the
pennsylvania
courts
in
a
malpractice
action
founded
on
state
law.
accordingly,
for
reasons
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
remand
this
case
to
that
court
to
determine
the
immunity
question
as
the
matter
of
state
law.
