mr.
julian
n.
eule
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
should
never
have
come
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
at
its
inception,
it
involved
no
more
than
a
state
common-law
malpractice
action
commenced
in
a
state
court
involving
two
private
parties,
an
attorney
and
his
client.
because,
however,
the
attorney
received
compensation
for
his
services
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
the
pennsylvania
state
courts
concluded
that
federal
common
law
afforded
him
absolute
immunity
from
such
a
state
cause
of
action.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
this
erroneous
invocation
of
federal
law
is
all
that
has
necessitated
review
by
this
court.
two
obviously
related
and
often
intertwined
questions
are
presented
by
this
case.
first,
does
federal
common
law
have
any
rightful
place
in
a
state
law
action
for
malpractice
commenced
by
an
individual
against
a
private
attorney
in
a
state
court
who
was
appointed
to
represent
him
in
a
federal
criminal
proceedings
under
the
criminal
justice
act?
second,
if,
in
fact,
federal
common
law
is
applicable,
what
is
the
nature
of
that
federal
common
law?
is
the
immunity
that
this
court
has
afforded
to
judges
and
prosecutors
equally
applicable
to
the
office
of
court-appointed
counsel?
francis
rick
ferri,
petitioner
herein,
was
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
both
the
united
states
criminal
code
and
the
internal
revenue
code
but
because
he
was
an
indigent,
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
mr.
daniel
ackerman,
the
respondent
herein,
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
ferri
in
this
criminal
proceeding.
although
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
internal
revenue
code
counts
had
run
by
the
time
the
indictment
was
filed,
mr.
ackerman
at
no
time
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
nor
in
any
other
way
raised
the
statute
of
limitations
defense.
mr.
ferri
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
20
years
on
the
counts
under
the
criminal
code
and
10
years
to
run
consecutive
to
the
criminal
code
counts
on
the
internal
revenue
code
counts.
on
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
mr.
ferri,
who
was
by
this
time
represented
by
new
counsel,
did
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
issue.
the
third
circuit,
in
a
judgment
order,
concluded
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
been
waived
by
its
failure
to
have
been
raised
at
trial.
it
is
this
failure
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
that
constitutes
the
thrust
of
mr.
ferri's
present
malpractice
issue,
malpractice
common-law
action
that
he
instituted
in
the
pennsylvania
courts.
pennsylvania
courts
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
federal
common
law
provided
an
absolute
right
of
immunity
against
suits.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
concluded
first
of
all
that
they
were
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
howard
versus
lyons
to
apply
federal
law
to
the
question
of
potential
liability
here
and
second
of
all,
that
the
federal
common
law
rule
of
immunity
that
has
applied
to
judges,
federal
judges
under
bradley
versus
fisher
and
federal
prosecutors
under
yaselli
versus
goff
applied
with
equal
force
to
court-appointed
counsel.
petitioner
submits
that
they
were
wrong
on
both
aspects
of
this
case
on
their
decision
to
invoke
federal
common
law
and
second,
in
their
ascertaining
what,
in
fact,
that
federal
common
law
was.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
yes,
that
is
what
the
petitioner
seeks
and
i
think
that
is
what
--
even
if
the
court
decides
the
question
on
the
second
issue
and
concludes
that
there
is
federal
common
law
but
that
federal
common
law
does
not
afford
immunity,
i
think
that
the
question
of
state
law
and
whether
state
law
affords
immunity
will
be
open
nevertheless.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
if
this
court
concluded
that
federal
common
law
was
applicable
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
--
and
that
federal
common
law
afforded
no
immunity,
i
think
it
would
still
be
within
the
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
yes,
it
was.
it
was
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
it
was
purely
a
diversity,
a
state
common
law
action
for
defamation.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
except
that
that
was
instituted
in
the
federal
court
and
this
was
instituted
in
the
state
court
but
aside
from
that,
it
is
akin
to
this
case.
i
should
bring
to
your
honors'
attention
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
currently
has
before
it
a
case
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
immunity
under
state
law.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
it
has
that
case
currently
before
it
now.
the
case
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
the
case
is
reece
versus
danforth.
the
case
has
been
briefed.
the
case
has
been
argued
but
no
decision
has
been
rendered
on
that
particular
case.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
it
has
come
from
the
superior
court.
it
is
presently
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
choose
to
hear
the
decision
from
the
superior
court.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
an
absolute
immunity
under
state
law.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
and
that
question
is
currently
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
yes.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
a
state
public
defender.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
it
is
in
civil
commitment
action.
it
is
not
in
a
criminal
proceedings.
it
is
in
civil
commitment
proceedings
that
that
has
taken
place.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
there
was
immunity
and
both
sides
referred
to
that
case
in
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
it
has
subsequently
come
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
it
definitely
would
not.
indeed,
it
is
my
argument
that
the
decisions
in
the
1983
actions,
many
of
which
have
been
dismissed
for
want
of
color
of
law,
are
entirely
consistent
with
my
position
that
this
is
not
a
federal
office
and
therefore,
there
is
no
need
to
apply
federal
law
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
i
believe
that
every
district
has
a
mixed
plan.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
a
public
defender
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
a
public
defender
does
raise
different
situations,
a
different
problem.
i
do
think,
not
insofar
as
the
immunity
question
but
certainly
insofar
as
whether
that
person
constitutes
a
federal
officer.
more
of
an
argument
could
be
made
because
the
trapping
of
office
are
present
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
i
think
that
in
that
particular
type
of
case
if
it
was
under
bivens
or
if
it
was
against
the
united
states'
government
under
the
federal
court
claims
act,
certainly
more
of
an
argument
could
be
made
that
there
was
a
color
of
law
provision.
the
seventh
circuit,
in
robinson
versus
bergstrom,
for
example,
recently
distinguished
the
public
defender's
office
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
in
both
cases
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
immunity.
i
think
whether
or
not
there
ought
to
be
no
immunity
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law
is
different.
the
public
defender
is
potentially
--
may
be
potentially
the
subject
of
a
suit
against
the
united
states
government
under
the
federal
court
claims
act.
he
may
be
deemed
to
be
an
employee.
no
circuit
has
yet
decided
that
question.
it
has
been
decided,
however,
that
a
court-appointed
--
private
court-appointed
lawyer
is
not
an
employee
of
the
government
and
therefore
no
suit
lies
against
the
government.
i
think
that
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
your
honors,
i
think
that
what
took
place
in
this
particular
case
is
not
a
question
of
discretionary
judgment.
i
think
failure
to
know
the
statute
of
limitations
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
perhaps
there
would
be
no
liability
to
the
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
but
not,
i
think,
on
the
ground
that
that
individual
was
not
an
employee.
the
cases
dealing
with
private
court-appointed
attorneys
have
been
decided
on
the
ground
that
that
individual
is
not
even
an
employee
who
falls
within
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
1983
actions
similar
against
court-appointed
counsel
have
almost
uniformly
been
dismissed
for
want
of
color
of
law.
the
courts,
at
least
the
lower
courts,
have
treated
the
public
defenders
somewhat
differently.
my
contention
is
that
on
the
question
of
immunity,
while
there
are
different
considerations,
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
different
considerations
that
are
involved
is
that
a
public
defender
is
prohibited
from
the
private
practice
of
law.
that
is,
100
per
cent
of
all
his
cases
would
be
appointed
cases.
the
private
court-appointed
lawyer
appointed
under
the
criminal
justice
act
is
not
so
prohibited.
indeed,
most
of
them
do
have
a
substantial
portion
of
their
practice
in
the
private
retained
domain.
i
think
that
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
your
honors,
i
believe
that
it
might
be
possible.
in
that
particular
case
i
think
a
very
different
constitutional
problem
would
be
raised
that
is
raised
by
this
particular
case.
there
would
then
be
a
legislative
judgment,
an
empirical
finding
of
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
and
the
danger
that
it
posed
to
the
representation
of
indigents
to
have
potential
liability.
i
do
think
that
it
might
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
whether
congress
could
grant
that.
i
think,
however,
your
honor,
that
congress
would
be
able
to.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
probably
pursuant
--
perhaps
pursuant
to
the
spending
clause.
if,
in
fact,
they
were
allocating
money
they
might
be
able
to
put
limitations
on
the
receipt
of
that
money
under
the
spending
clause.
i
think,
however,
it
might
create
some
sixth
amendment
problems.
if,
in
fact,
the
source
of
the
individual's
right
to
be
represented
is
not
congress
but
is
the
constitution,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
then
all
congress
is
doing
is
compensating
and
if,
in
fact,
it
is
concluded
that
the
immunity
that
is
granted
provides
for
less-effective
representation
than
if
a
person
is
potentially
liable,
i
think
it
would
have
sixth
amendment
problems.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
your
honor,
not
entirely.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
perhaps
under
2255.
it
is,
however,
within
the
domain
of
all
the
state
supreme
courts
of
these
united
states
to
adjudge
the
quality
of
representation
and
take
disciplinary
action
against
lawyers,
even
if
that
representation
took
place
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding
and
in
those
cases
i
would
believe
that
the
state
laws,
disciplinary
laws
which
control
conduct
would
be
the
governing
rules
on
the
appropriate
discipline
to
be
taken
against
lawyers.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
i
would
have
no
difficulty
with
that
type
of
legislation.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
certainly
i
think
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
certainly
i
think
that
congress
could
do
that.
whether
congress
--
i
believe
that
congress
could
perhaps
even
grant
immunity
to
private
court-appointed
lawyers.
i
do
think
it
would
create
some
equal
protection
problems.
i
do
not
think
it
creates
anywhere
near
the
amount
of
equal
protection
problems
that
are
created
where
we
have
a
rule
that
is
not
subject
of
congressional
action
where
there
is
no
need
for
the
deference
to
the
wisdom
of
the
law
or
the
deference
to
the
legislative
judgment
or
the
majoritarian
will
or
the
empirical
fact-finding
that
has
been,
in
fact,
engaged
in
by
the
legislative
process.
i
think
the
scrutiny
of
a
common-law
action
ought
to
be
greater
than
that
when
we
deal
with
--
when
this
court
deals
with
congressional
legislation.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
i
think
he
would
have
absolute
immunity.
i
think
certainly
a
state
judge
under
stump
versus
sparkman,
pierson
versus
ray
and
the
federal
judges
as
well,
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
with
that
question;
as
well
with
the
prosecutor.
i
think
the
prosecutor
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
the
judge.
there
is
a
very
different
situation
presented
here,
not
only
because
an
individual
is
much
more
clearly
not
only
an
officer
of
the
government
but
indeed,
represents
the
government.
but
i
think
policy-wise
there
is
a
very
different
situation
that
the
judge
or
the
prosecutor
is
in
than
the
court-appointed
counsel.
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
owe
their
duty
to
the
public,
not
to
the
specific
individual.
their
overriding
duty
is
to
the
public
and
very
often
they
may
have
to
act
and
indeed,
do
act
in
ways
that
are
not
in
the
best
interest
of
that
particular
individual
because
their
duty
is
to
act
in
the
best
interest
of
the
public.
when
we
deal
with
court-appointed
counsel
we
deal
with
a
person
who
owes
his
primary
duty
to
the
client.
therefore,
the
creation
of
liability
at
the
hands
of
the
very
person
to
whom
if
not
the
sole,
certainly
the
primary
duty
is
owed
does
not
create
the
potential
conflict
that
subjecting
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor
would.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
because
the
present
procedures
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
do
not
utilize
that
type
of
involuntary
appointment.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
the
person
would
have
to
volunteer
to
be
put
on
the
list,
yes.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
he
is
being
compensated
and
he
has
also
volunteered.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
that
is
correct
except
that
the
district
does
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
standards,
standard-making
themselves
in
looking
into
the
qualifications
of
the
particular
individual
and
people
are,
in
fact
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct
and
i
believe
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
as
to
whether
a
person
could,
in
fact,
be
forced
to
and
whether
that,
in
fact,
would
create
some
constitutional
problems
as
has
been
suggested,
i
do
not
know.
it
has
not
come
up
in
that
district
because
there
is
no
such
procedure
that
exists
in
that
particular
district.
howard
versus
lyons
application
to
a
federal
officer
is
undisputed.
what
is
contended
by
petitioner
is
that
this
individual
is
simply
not
a
federal
officer.
his
source
of
authority
is
not
the
federal
government.
it
is
the
state
that
licenses
the
lawyers.
it
is
the
state
that
judges
standards
for
lawyers.
while
one
would
have
to
be
admitted
to
that
particular
district,
most
of
the
united
states
district
courts
have
almost
an
automatic
admission
policy
for
individuals
solely
upon
their
admission
to
that
state
bar.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
how
pennsylvania
will
go
in
that
particular
case
and
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
they
will
go
either
way.
i
should
like
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention,
although
it
is
certainly
not
binding
on
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
that
neither
counsel
in
that
case
has
argued
for
absolute
immunity.
they
have
only
argued
for
qualified
immunity
in
that
particular
case.
certainly
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
not
bound
by
that
decision
and
they
may
conclude
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
but
in
any
event,
it
is
somewhat
distinguishable
on
its
facts
from
this
particular
case
and
may
not
govern
in
any
event
in
that
that
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
not
a
criminal
proceeding
that
is
involved.
there
is
a
public
defender
who
has
represented
an
individual
in
a
civil
commitment
action.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
absolutely
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
you
deal
with
the
individual's
right,
the
individual
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
in
the
criminal
action
and
so
we
are
dealing
with
more
than
a
right
that
is
afforded
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
federal
right
but
it
also
applies
in
state
proceedings
as
well.
but
that
right
may
distinguish
a
civil
commitment
proceedings
in
that
the
problem
which
is
faced
when
one
deals
with
civil
proceedings
is
that
very
often
what
one
has
is
all
volunteers,
individuals
who
take
pro
bono
cases.
now,
that
would
not
be
the
case,
certainly,
in
a
federal
criminal
action
unless
that
individual
wished
to
take
it
without
the
compensation
offered
by
the
criminal
justice
act.
whether
volunteers
would
create
a
different
situation
or
not,
it
certainly
would
not
be
a
matter
of
federal
law
if
an
individual
volunteered
to
represent
a
person
in
a
particular
action.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
indeed,
i
would
think
that
under
erie
that
the
federal
court
would
be
bound
to
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
then
certainly
the
state
creating
immunity
to
a
cause
of
action
it
itself
has
create
no
problems
insofar
as
the
choice
of
law
problem.
the
individual
who
is
bringing
the
action
here,
is
bringing
an
action
against
an
individual
who
owes
him
a
duty,
owes
him
the
duty
of
effective
representation.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
this
distinguishes
the
judge.
it
distinguishes
the
prosecutor,
those
individuals.
this
court's
grant
of
immunity
to
those
individuals
has
been
precisely
because
the
court
did
not
wish
to
create
the
conflict
between
on
the
one
hand
the
duty
imposed
by
law,
the
duty
to
the
public
and
the
public
interest
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
duty
to
the
particular
individual
or
at
least
the
fear
that
the
particular
individual
before
him
will
subsequently
sue
him
for
malpractice
or
potential
liability.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
i
do
not
contend
that
but
i
do
contend
that
the
problem
is
that
there
is
a
conflicting
duty
there
and
that
the
judge's
public
duty
is
to
decide
in
the
best
interests
of
the
public.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
well,
there
certainly
are
with
regard
to
the
disciplinary
rules
that
govern
his
conduct.
incidentally,
one
of
those
disciplinary
rules
is
the
rule
that
an
attorney
may
not
contract
with
his
client
to
provide
immunity
from
suit.
in
any
event,
the
suit
against
the
counsel
would,
however,
be
with
regard
to
a
duty
that
was
primarily
owed
to
the
client
and
the
conflict
between
the
self-preservation
instinct
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
those
immunity
cases
and
the
duty
that
is
imposed
would
not
be
present
because
here
they
would
coalesce.
that
is,
the
self-preservation
instinct
would
be
protected
in
the
very
same
way
that
the
performance
of
the
duty
imposed
by
law
would
be
protected.
this
court,
i
think
that
it
is
the
case
that
i
find
most
clearly
on
point,
in
miree
versus
dekalb
county,
concluded
that
in
a
state
cause
of
action,
in
a
state
court,
between
two
private
parties,
even
where
the
federal
government
had
provided
compensation
which
had,
in
fact,
in
that
case
created
the
duty
--
the
duty
to
provide
for
safety
in
the
miree
case,
this
court
concluded
unanimously
that
there
was
no
need
for
federal
law
to
apply.
the
analogy,
i
think,
is
quite
clear.
we
have
a
contractual
arrangement.
the
government
is
providing
funds.
the
recipient
of
the
funds
has
not
performed
the
duty
imposed
upon
him
when
those
funds
were
granted
and
the
individual,
whether
he
is
suing
as
an
implied
beneficiary
of
that
contract
or
suing
instead
in
malpractice,
which
is
in
itself
a
combination
of
a
tort
action
and
a
malpractice
action,
the
potential
liability
of
that
individual,
even
though
they
are
a
recipient
of
federal
funds,
should
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
we
contend,
however,
not
only
that
it
should
be
a
matter
of
state
law
but
that,
in
fact,
if
federal
law
is
found
to
be
applicable,
that
that
federal
interest
here
would
not
be
an
interest
in
immunity
but
would
be
in
accountability.
in
butz,
this
court
indicated
that
an
individual
who
seeks
immunity
from
suit
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
is
a
need
for
such
immunity.
i
think
here
the
burden
has
not
been
sustained.
immunity
would
discourage
precisely
that
which
immunity
is
designed
to
encourage,
the
vigorous
performance
of
duty.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
correct.
as
i
indicated,
even
if
this
court
concludes
that
federal
common
law
is
applicable
and
that
federal
common
law
affords
no
immunity,
i
think
that
it
would
still
be
within
the
right
of
the
state
court
to
impose
immunity
itself,
even
if
the
federal
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
the
second
issue
is
not
necessarily
to
be
reached
if
the
first
is
decided.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
the
federal
government's
interest,
if
any
here,
is
in
a
standard
of
care
for
indigents.
the
purpose
of
the
criminal
justice
act
was
to
improve
those
standards.
immunity
is
a
logical
way
to
approve
those
standards.
not
only
are
the
policy
reasons
clearly
against
it
but
this
court
ought
to
be
concerned
with
the
appearance
of
justice
as
well,
the
appearance
of
treating
the
indigent,
who
is
unable
to
afford
his
attorney,
differently
than
it
treats
an
individual
who
can
retain
attorneys;
the
mistrust
that
exists
between
lawyers,
court-appointed
lawyers
and
the
indigent
is
hardly
likely
to
be
helped
by
the
absolute
grant
of
immunity
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government.
at
this
point
in
time,
it
seems
to
me,
an
unwise
thing
for
--
in
view
of
the
cynical
attitudes
that
have
developed
around
the
legal
profession
in
general
--
that
a
different
rule
should
be
established
with
regard
to
lawyers
than
has
been
established
with
regard
to
doctors.
physicians
are
liable
even
if
they
receive
medicaid
funds.
the
mere
receipt
of
medicaid
funds
does
not
distinguish
the
case
from
a
physician
who,
in
fact,
has
been
paid,
has
been
retained
by
--
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
that
is
correct.
in
this
case
it
would
be
even
stronger
but
in
that
case
where
it
is
weaker,
the
federal
government
interests
certainly
--
or
the
indigent's
interest
is
weaker.
nevertheless
the
legal
profession
has
treated
the
fully-paid
physician
the
same
as
it
has
treated
the
one
who
is
the
recipient
of
a
federal
funding
program.
mr.
julian
n.
eule
no,
that
is
certainly
not
a
case
from
this
court.
the
physicians
who
do
work
for
the
federal
government,
that
is,
veteran's
administration
physicians,
public
health
physicians
and
armed
forces
physicians,
congress
has
legislated
as
to
all
three
of
those
and
congress
has
created
an
exclusive
remedy
against
the
united
states
government
and
has
in
turn
afforded
immunity
of
sorts
to
those
physicians
in
return
for
creating
the
absolute
or
exclusive
right
of
action
under
the
federal
court
claims
act
and
connecticut
has
adopted
a
similar
approach
with
regard
to
public
defenders
and
court-appointed
attorneys.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
potential
liability
on
the
part
of
public
defenders
and
that
there
was
no
immunity
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
connecticut
legislature
has
subsequently
passed
the
statute
and
that
statute
has
created
an
exclusive
right
of
action
against
the
state
in
return
for
immunity.
