chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
ferri
against
ackerman.
mr.
eule,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
our
cases
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
is
it
not
reasonably
clear
that
if
it
is
a
federal
function,
it
is
a
discretionary
federal
function,
it
would
be
exempt
from
any
liability
on
the
government
as
distinguished
from
the
individual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
no,
no,
i
did
not
use
discretion
in
that
sense;
discretion
in
the
sense
that
it
is
used,
a
discretionary
governmental
function
in
the
sense
that
is
used
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
under
our
cases
relating
to
that
act
and
i
am
only
speaking
to
the
liability
of
the
government,
not
the
liability
of
the
individual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
back
that
up
with
another
hypothetical.
suppose
the
judge
who
made
the
appointment
was
guilty
of
such
gross
negligence
in
appointing
an
obviously
incompetent
person.
would
there
be
any
liability
on
the
judge?
or
would
he
have
absolute
immunity
under
our
holdings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
would
be
a
difference
between
the
responsibility
of
the
counsel
in
a
civil
case
and
a
criminal
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
federal
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
arness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
case,
if
liability
is
to
be
imposed
or
immunity
is
to
be
granted,
involves
a
great
deal
more
than
just
forgetting
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
involves
every
aspect
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
suppose
after
the
defendant
was
convicted
the
defendant
brought
suit
for
malpractice
saying
that
the
defense
counsel
told
him
there
was
no
chance
of
an
acquittal
unless
he
testified,
that
that
was
the
considered
judgment
of
defense
counsel.
and
so
the
defendant
decided
to
testify
and
then
was
exposed,
of
course,
to
the
usual
cross-examination
and
now
his
claim
is
on
one
thing
only,
namely,
that
that
was
bad
advice,
that
exposed
him
to
the
conviction
and
brought
about
the
conviction.
that
would
be
grounds
for
a
malpractice
suit,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
a
holding
of
liability.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
the
defense
counsel
decided
not
to
cross-examine
a
prosecution
witness,
that
might
be
a
basis
for
a
malpractice
suit,
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
not
the
privately-paid
counsel
performing
a
governmental
function?
he
is
performing
it
because
the
court
has
said
the
constitution
requires
that
there
be
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
root
of
the
matter,
the
root
of
the
matter,
that
is,
the
requirement
of
the
presence
of
counsel
stems
from
the
constitution
in
both
cases,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
put
it
on
a
concrete
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
there
not
been
occasions
where
a
defense
counsel,
paid,
now,
for
the
moment,
a
paid
defense
counsel
privately
retained,
has
informed
the
court
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
that
he
has
advised
the
defendant
not
to
take
the
stand
and
that
he
wants
the
court
to
know
that
he
has
given
that
advice
but
the
defendant
insists
on
taking
the
stand.
now,
taking
that
hypothetical,
is
the
situation
any
different
for
a
privately-retained
lawyer
or
a
public
defender
such
as
we
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
fearlessness
factor
any
different
in
the
two?
if
the
lawyer
is
skilled
enough
to
realize
that
that
is,
in
the
particular
situation
that
that
is
a
desirable
thing
to
do
for
his
own
protection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
that
is
not
very
easy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
ferri
against
ackerman
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
