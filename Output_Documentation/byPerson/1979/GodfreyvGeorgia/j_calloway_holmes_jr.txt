mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
death
penalty
case
out
of
the
state
of
georgia.
i
represent
mr.
robert
franklin
godfrey,
who
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
the
killings
of
his
wife
and
her
mother,
his
mother-in-law.
it
is
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
from
georgia
supreme
court.
the
issue,
as
framed
by
this
court
in
this
case,
is
whether
in
affirming
the
death
sentence
in
this
case,
has
the
georgia
supreme
court
adopted
such
a
broad
and
vague
construction
of
section
27-2534.1(b)(7)
as
to
violate
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
u.s.
constitution?
section
(b)(7)
is
one
of
ten
aggravating
circumstances
that
are
the
statutory
guides
to
jurors
in
posing
the
death
sentence,
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
georgia
proceedings.
before
getting
into
the
merits
of
the
construction
of
section
(b)(7)
by
the
georgia
court,
i
would
not
want
to
dwell
too
long,
but
i
think
it
would
be
important
to
cover
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
defendant,
mr.
godfrey,
and
his
wife,
the
record
shows,
had
had
a
stormy
marriage.
he
had
been
committed
by
her
on
three
previous
occasions
to
the
state
mental
hospital
in
milledgeville,
georgia.
they
had
had
a
violent
argument
early
in
september
of
1977,
and
she
had
left
the
house
after
he
had
threatened
her
in
a
drunken
rage.
after
about
a
week,
the
wife
had
filed
divorce
proceedings
and
had
moved
in
with
her
mother,
who
was
urging
her
to
go
ahead
and
finally
put
an
end
to
this
marriage.
the
defendant
had
worked
for
approximately
20
years
at
the
northwest
regional
hospital
as
a
surgical
nurse
and
a
post-operative
male
nurse.
he
had
been
to
work
that
day,
and
his
mother-in-law
had
called
him
out
of
the
hospital
to
tell
him
that
his
wife
wanted
to
speak
to
him
that
evening.
the
defendant
testified
that
that
led
him
to
expect
that
he
was--or
to
hope
that
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
reconcile
the
situation
as
he
had
been
able
to
do
in
the
past.
his
commitments
to
the
state
mental
hospital
in
the
past
had
been
voluntary,
part
of
which
was
the
condition
for
reconciliation
with
his
wife.
when
he
got
home,
his
wife
did
in
fact
call
him.
they
had
a
rather
violent
argument,
could
not
reach
any
kind
of
agreement
on
reconciliation
or
any
of
the
divorce
issues.
she
hung
up,
told
him
that
she
would
call
back
later
and
see
if
they
could
discuss
it
further.
he
testified
that
that
affected
him
deeply,
that
he
was
put
into
a
very
depressed
state.
after
the
second
phone
conversation,
which
was
even
more
heated
and
she
finally
hung
up
on
him,
he
testified
at
that
point
that
he
blanked
out.
he
had
had
some--whatever
history
that
is
in
the
record--blackouts
in
the
past.
the
record
substantiates
that
he
then
proceeded
to
get
a
shotgun,
go
down
the
hill
to
where
the
mother-in-law's
trailer
was,
about
a
hundred,
two
hundred
yards
away,
came
up
behind
the
trailer,
fired
one
shot
through
the
back
window,
killing
his
wife
instantly,
came
into
the
trailer,
hit
his
daughter
as
she
was
going
out,
on
the
head,
causing
several
stitches,
went
into
the
trailer,
reloading
his
shotgun,
and
shot
his
mother-in-law
in
the
head
as
well,
creating
a
very
gory
scene
inside
the
trailer,
which
the
prosecutor
in
the
case
portrayed
by
color
pictures
even
though
he
had
black
and
white
pictures
of
the
same
scenes
in
his
file.
the
petitioner
then
called
the
sheriff's
office,
told
them
what
he
had
done,
told
them
to
come
get
him.
they
asked
him
where
he
was.
he
explained
where
he
was.
he
then
goes
outside
the
trailer,
places
the
shotgun
in
the
branches
of
an
apple
tree,
and
then
sits
down
under
a
shade
tree
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
police.
when
the
police
get
there,
he
tells
them
that
they
are
dead,
it
is
all
over
with,
and
shows
one
officer
where
he
has
placed
the
gun.
he
is
taken
into
custody,
taken
downtown,
is
in
the
county
police
building.
in
the
presence
of
one
officer
he
has
allegedly
told
him
that
he
had
done
a
heinous
thing
and
had
thought
about
it
for
a
long
time
and
would
do
it
again.
at
the
trial
dr.
davis,
the
psychiatrist
from
atlanta
with
quite
impressive
credentials,
testified
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
he
had
seen
the
defendant
twice
pursuant
to
court
order,
had
also
treated
the
defendant
back
in
the
'60s
in
rome
where
the
defendant
worked
in
the
hospital
there.
the
second
session
with
dr.
davis
was
for
the
purpose
of
a
sodium
anatol
interview,
truth
serum,
to
aid
the
psychiatrist
in
his
diagnosis
of
the
mental
state
and
i
suppose
also
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
defendant's
story.
the
psychiatrist
concluded
that
at
the
time
of
the
second
phone
call
and
the
blackout
of
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant
had
been
impaled
by
the
immense
emotional
provocation
that
he
felt
about
the
breakup
of
his
marriage
into
what
he
described
as
a
dissociative
reaction
and
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
that
state
is
an
altered
state
of
consciousness
but
that
the
defendant
probably
would
have
known
right
from
wrong
but
would
not
have
been
able
to
consciously
control
his
actions.
there
is
a
type
of
psychiatric
condition
where
suppressed
feelings
are
played
out
in
sort
of
an
automatic
fashion
without
real
conscious
control
over
it.
the
state
had
psychiatric
testimony
from
milledgeville
hospital,
with
some--also
the
records
of
the
defendant's
previous
incarceration
down
there.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
they
did
not
accept
the
defense
of
temporary
insanity.
they
were
advanced
for
two
purposes,
to
try
to
establish
the
lack
of
criminal
intent
and
also
for
purposes
of
mitigation.
we
felt
that
we
were--this
was
a
case
that
ought
to
be--ought
to
get
a
light
sentence,
felt
that
the
prosecutor
should
not
have
requested
the
death
sentence.
but
that
testimony
was
really
going
more
to
the
mitigation.
our
psychiatric
witness
admitted
that
it
was
a
non-psychotic
condition,
and
they
equated
a
psychotic
condition
with
insanity.
so,
i
think
the
jury
by
that
concession
concluded
that
there
was
no
real
insanity
defense.
when
the
prosecutor
argued
during
the
sentencing
phase
to
the
jury,
under
section
(b)(7),
which
was
the
only
aggravating
circumstance
submitted
to
the
jury,
which
is
as
follows.
that
the
offense
of
murder
was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
or
inhuman
in
that
it
involves
torture,
depravity
of
mind,
or
an
aggravated
battery
to
the
victim--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
think
it
is
both,
your
honor.
depravity
of
mind
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
case
decided
at
the
same
time
as
godfrey,
holton
v.
state,
in
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
expressed
the
opinion
and
dicta
that
if
a
circumstance
was
only
composed
of
depravity
of
mind,
that
that
would
probably
be
insufficient
under
the
furman
decision.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
the
first
killing
was
in
the
presence
of
the
child.
she
ran
out.
the
second
killing
did--there
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
few
seconds.
there
was
anticipation.
there
was
anticipation
of
death
as
far
as
the
mother-in-law
was
concerned.
but
i
believe
that
if
you--i
think
what
you
are
getting
at
is
whether
or
not
that,
as
one
georgia
case
has
held,
is
sufficient
to
find
torture.
i
do
not
think
momentary
anticipation
of
death
is
what
is
contemplated
by
the
word
"torture."
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
not
specifically
held
that.
they
have
held
one
case
that
is
similar
to
that--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
that--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
they
are
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances
at
present
and
could
not
be
the
basis
for
a
death
sentence.
whether
or
not--if
there
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
number
eleven
that
said,
"if
you
commit
two
first
degree
murders
in
the
same
transaction,
then
that
permits
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence,
"
i
would
think,
without
a
chance
to
analyze
it,
that
that
would
probably
be
specific
enough.
it
would
certainly
be
as
specific
as
some
of
the
other--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
of
course
true.
the
goal
of
perfection
in
this
type
instance
would
be
very
difficult
to
reach.
but
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
told
the
jury
that
torture
was
not
involved
and
that
aggravated
battery
was
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
the
jury
only
found
a
partial
finding
of
(b)(7).
they
found
it
was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman.
those
terms--and
the
court
approved
that.
there
is
another
case
cited
in
the
brief
where
a
jury
found
under
section
(b)(7)
that
the
offense
was
both
horrible
and
inhuman.
so,
our
argument
is
that
the
authoritative
construction
of
section
(b)(7)
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
that
that
language,
standing
alone,
is
sufficient.
in
other
words,
they
have
construed
this
to
the
effect
that
(b)(7)
is
really
only
composed
of
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman.
and
we
feel
strongly
that
that
is
no
standard
at
all.
that
is
totally
subjective.
it
certainly
has
no
objective
component
in
it
to
make
review
rational.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
would
be
a
wholly
different
case,
your
honor.
but
if
they
chose
to
get
that
specific
and
they
described
a
particular
type
mother
and
the
facts
of
the
case
fit
that
description,
then
the
question
here
is
whether
the
aggravating
circumstance
can
provide
any
guidance
to
channel
the
discretion
of
jurors.
under
that
standard,
by
describing
the
crime
very
specifically
and
the
facts
meet
that
crime
very
specifically,
you
have
a
standard
that
can
be
reasonably
followed
by
a
jury.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
it
may
be,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
qualified
by
some
objective
portion.
if
you
take
this
section
(b)(7)
as
a
whole,
leaving
torture
and
aggravated
battery
in
it,
that
is
something
that
you
can
point
to
that
can
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
standard
in
the
sentencing
phase
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
it--under
the
georgia
statute,
an
aggravated
battery
is
the
depriving
of
a
member.
and
if
the
top
of
the
head
is
a
member
of
the
body,
then
that
just
fits
the
description.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor,
because
you
can
live
if
you
just
lost
an
arm.
but
that
gets
into
some
close
questions
of
definition.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
it
could
conceivably
embrace
it.
but
the
jury
did
not
find
it,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
upheld
the
partial
finding
and,
in
effect,
said
that
the
jury's
phraseology
in
finding
it
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman
only
was
not
objectionable.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
if
the
jury
had
made
the
same
partial
finding
and
under
the
entire
circumstances
and
yet
the
judge,
the
court,
had
held
that
that
was
a
sufficient
standard
or
that
was
a
sufficient
finding,
in
effect
saying
that
that
composes
the
standard,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
certainly
as
it
has
been
construed
in
this
case,
any
first
degree
murder
and
any
loss
of
life
under
the
common
definitions
is
going
to
be
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman.
it
encompasses
the
range
entirely
of
first
degree
murder.
i
do
not
know
how
it
could
not
be
found
to
be.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is
horrible
and
it
is
inhuman
as
well.
but
every
other
murder
is.
every
other
murder
is.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
think
that
was
the
intent
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
has
been
construed
in
a
totally
open-ended
fashion.
it
has
not
been
narrowed
by
definition
as
the--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
issue
is
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
section
(b)(7)
has
been
unconstitutionally
construed
on
its
face
as
well
as
the
issue
of
whether
it
just
simply
been
unconstitutionally
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
i
did
qualify
that
answer
by
saying
that
if
you
asked
me
that
question
about
any
murder,
i
would
agree.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
one
reason--one
problem
that
is
pointed
out
by
this
is
that
the
standard,
as
construed
by
the
georgia
court
here,
is
so
vague
and
over-broad
that
it
is
not
capable
of
rational
and
objective
review.
of
course,
it
could
fit
this
circumstance.
it
could
fit
any
number
of
other
circumstances
across
the
range
of
first
degree
murder.
and
factors
in
this
case
that
are
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances
cannot
under
the
statute
be
sufficient
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
that
were
raised
during
the
questioning
on
the
gregg
case.
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
take
the
position
very
strongly
that
the
gregg
case
did
not
hold
section
(b)(7)
constitutional.
there
was
a
limiting
footnote
in
that
case,
footnote
no.
51
that
referred
to
limited
grant
of
certiorari
in
that
case,
which
was
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
death
penalty
in
that
case
was
unconstitutional.
in
that
case,
even
though
section
(b)(7)
was
charged,
it
was
not
found.
the
court
in
responding
to
the
arguments
of
counsel
that
section
(b)(7)
could
apply
to
any
murder,
the
court
said
in
part
it
is
of
course
arguable
that
any
murder
involves
depravity
of
mind
or
an
aggravated
battery.
but
this
language
need
not
be
construed
in
this
way.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
will
adopt
such
an
open-ended
construction.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
is
96
supreme
court
2909
at
2938.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
it
is
recorded
in
page
21-22
of
the
brief.
footnote
51
i
think
indicates
that
section
(b)(7)
was
considered
in
that
case
only
to
the
extent
they
considered
the
attack
against
the
entire
system.
so,
i
do
not
believe
the
court
has
really
decided
that
question.
but
this
question
is
somewhat
somewhat
narrower
because
this
question
is
limited
to
how
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
has
construed
section
(b)(7).
they
have
construed
it,
as
conceded
by
the
state,
to
really
only
include
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman.
and
another
case,
i
think
the
blake
v.
state
case,
has
said
that
outrageously
and
wantonly
only
modify
vile,
and
they
do
not
modify
horrible
and
inhuman.
and
since
the
statute
is
couched
in
disjunctive
terms,
that
means
that
a
jury
would
be
authorized
to
find
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
on
a
finding
that
the
murder
was
horrible.
that
is
why
we
say
that
the
open-ended
construction
that
this
court
was
not
willing
to
assume
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
would
adopt
has
in
fact
been
adopted.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
with
reference
in
the
brief
to
the
42
to
45
other
domestic
murder
cases
in
georgia
that
have
been
appealed
where
life
sentences
were
granted,
of
those
there
has
been
no
death
penalty.
many
of
those
cases--they
are
indicated
in
the
brief--are
similar
on
the
facts
to
this
godfrey
case,
including
two
or
three
multiple
murders.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
is
what
the
jury
did.
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
no
case
has
found
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
warranted
on
the
facts,
particularly
under
section
(b)(7).
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
if
they
had
been,
i
believe
that
i
have
to
agree
that
that
is
included,
the
horrible
torture
murder
is
probably
or
necessarily
what
was
intended
to
be
reached.
but
because
if
you
assume
that
they
had
all
been
that
horrible
and
then
this
one
comes
along,
really
the
georgia
supreme
court
has,
under
that
hypothesis,
never
had
an
occasion
yet
to
demonstrate
how
they
did
construe
this
section.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
until
this
one.
this
one
shows
that
they
construe
it
to
indicate
any
first
degree
murder
where
the
jury
has
imposed
the
death
sentence.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
you
mean
categories--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
--of
vile,
horrible
or
inhuman
as
separate
categories?
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
if
it
fits
one,
it
would
fit
all
of
them.
and
in
blake
v.
state
that
is
really
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
held.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
in
theory,
yes.
under
this
case,
no.
for
one
thing,
i
do
not
know
how
it
could
meet
the
burden
of
proving
something--some
murder
was
horrible
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
completely
subjective,
you
know.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
assume
that
they
did.
the
course
of
the
sentence
review--in
this
case
the
state
has
characterized
this
domestic
murder
in
its
brief
as
an
execution
style
murder.
they
did
not
dream
up
that
separate
category
of
murder.
i
believe
not-for-profit
execution
style
murder
is
what
they
have
called
it.
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
mention
that
in
the
godfrey
case.
but
in
another
case
they
created
that
category
in
order
to
uphold
a
section
(b)(7).
so,
they
have
ignored
the
45
domestic
murder
cases,
although
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
even
sought
in
but
14
of
those.
and
the
jury
did
not
find
the
death
penalty
or
a
section
(b)(7).
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
could
not
say
that
it
could
not
fit
because
our
point
is
that
anything--any
characterization
of
a
first
degree
murder
could
fit
within
section
(b)(7).
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they
have
created
this
category.
our
point
is
to--in
order
to--under
the
statute--they
have
a
duty
under
the
statute
to
compare
these
death
sentence
cases
with
similar
cases,
and
they
have
in
the
past
said
that
that
will
be
determined
by
the--what
juries
have
done
in
similar
cases
in
georgia
before.
so,
they
have
ignored
the
category
to
which
this
properly
belongs,
domestic
murders
with
a
great
deal
of
emotional
and
psychological
diminished
capacity.
in
taking
it
and
putting
it
into
another
category
where
they
can
compare
with
15
cases
cited
in
the
appendix
and
say
that
that
is
similar,
they
are
using
the
similar
word
under
the
sentence
review
in
a
very
elastic
manner
in
order
to
uphold
these
section
(b)(7).
and
they
do
not
compare
section
(b)(7)
cases
with
only
other
section
(b)(7)
cases.
in
this
case
there
are
only
two
of
the
15
cited
as
similar
that
were
section
(b)(7)
only.
the
rest
of
them
were
(b)(2),
rape,
armed
robbery
murders.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
have
got
221.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
i
think
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
the
gregg
case
that
in
addition
to
the
aggravating
circumstance
guidelines,
there
was
the
additional
sentence
review
to
be
conducted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
which
would
be
an
additional
safeguard
against
capricious
and
arbitrary
infliction
of
the
death
sentence.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
they
have
construed
their
duty
under
that
to
compare
it--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
--with
all
other
cases,
life
sentence
cases,
appealed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
other
cases
where
the
death
sentence
had
been
imposed
and
compare
those
and
then
cite
which
cases
they
find
to
be
similar
in
order
to
uphold
the
death
sentence.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
is
why
i
think
those
cases
are
relevant
because
there
are
many
of
them
in
there
that
are
very
similar
to
godfrey
that
they
have
apparently
ignored.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
those
are
all
life
sentence
cases
that
were
appealed.
those
are
the
only
ones--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
the
only
ones
that
they
considered
are
the
ones
that
were
appealed.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
that
discounts
all
those
where
a
prosecutor
made
a
decision
to
allow
a
plea
for
a
life
sentence
or
for
voluntary
manslaughter.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
the
point
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
feel
that
the
construction
that
we
contend
is
open-ended
on
its
face--
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
--is
somehow
cured
by
the
fact
of
the
statutory
sentence
review,
then
this,
we
think,
demonstrates
that
the
statutory
sentence
review
is
not
anything
like
was
expected
by
this
court
in
gregg
and
that
they
are
not
performing
the
duty
that
they
are
supposed
to
perform.
mr.
j.
calloway
holmes,
jr.
none.
