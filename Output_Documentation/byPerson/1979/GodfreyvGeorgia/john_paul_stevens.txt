justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
this
were
listed
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
the
statute,
would
it
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dunsmore,
could
i
ask
two
questions,
one
on
the
deliberate
character
of
it?
that
is
essential
element
of
the
offense
itself,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
question
i
had
is
the
charge
of
the
court
directed
the
jury
to
designate
in
writing
the
aggravating
circumstances,
the
circumstances
which
you
found
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
next
page
of
the
record
shows
the
form
of
verdict
they
returned,
and
it
says
that
the
offense
of
murder
was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman,
and
does
not
go
on
and
say
it
involved
depravity
of
mind
and
the
like.
the
question
i
am
unclear
on
is,
is
this
the
jury's
language
or
is
this
a
form
that
the
judge
gave
to
them,
that
was
pretyped
and
they
just
signed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
proper
form?
i
wonder
why
it
did
not
track
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
language
of
the
instruction
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
given
orally,
but
the
instruction
did
not
go
to
the
jury
in
writing,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it?
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
question,
just
so
i
will
get
it
all
out
and
you
have
the
time
to
comment
on
it,
at
the
top
of
page
86,
which
is
the
part
of
the
judge's
form,
which
apparently
accompanies
the
record
on
appeal,
the
defense
of
murder--and
he
strikes--the
things
that
he
instructed
the
jury
on.
it
says,
"the
offense
of
murder"--
then
he
strikes
some
language
out--"was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible"--
and
he
changes
"or"
to
"and
inhuman
in
that
it
involved
torture"
and
so
forth.
so
you
see
that
first
one
under
the
"g"
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
there
are
brackets
around
the
first
part
of
it,
and
the
brackets
correspond
with
the
jury's
verdict,
and
the
remainder
corresponds
with
the
instruction.
is
it
fair
to
infer
that
those
brackets
were
inserted
by
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dunsmore,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
way
the
georgia
court
construes
the
statute?
are
the
words
"in
that
it
involved
torture,
depravity
of
mind,
and
aggravated
battery"
still
part
of
the
essential
definition
of
of
this
aggravated
circumstance,
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
read
that
out
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
regard
those
as
illustrative
words
rather
than
limiting
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course
when
the
court
in
the
gregg
case
considered
the
statute,
i
think
the
court
assumed
that
those
were
limiting
words.
would
that
not
be?
i
do
not
know
if
we
really
had
to
reach
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
then
construe
the
statute
just
as
though
those
words
were
not
in
it
at
all.
and,
if
that
is
true,
then
i
suppose
the
bloody
character
of
the
shotgun
killing
could
make
it
vile.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
would
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
shotgun
rather
than
a
rifle
to
justify
the
finding
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
the
constitutional
problem
is
whether
a
statute
which
just
in
broad
language
says
any
murder,
rape,
armed
robbery,
or
kidnapping
that
is
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
or
inhuman,
period,
is
enough
to
be
an
aggravated
circumstance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
know
how
they
put
him
on
notice
if
you
say
they
are
just
illustrative
and
you
say
anything
else
somewhat
similar
is
also
going
to
be
covered.
