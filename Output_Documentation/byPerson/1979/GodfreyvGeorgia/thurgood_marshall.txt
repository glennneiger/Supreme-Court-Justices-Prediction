is
not
this
always
in
first
degree
murder?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
give
me
a
motive
that
is
not
heinous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
first
degree
murder.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
looking
at
pages
80
and
81,
there
are
two
verdicts.
would
you
tell
me
whether
the
jury
found
that
the
conduct
was
outrageously
or
that
the
conduct
was
wantonly?
which
was
it
according
to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
was
it,
according
to
this?
they
found
it
was
one
or
the
other.
were
they
satisfied
that
something
is
one
or
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
say
outrageously
and
wantonly.
they
said
outrageously
or
want
only.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
the
normal
language
used
in
americus,
georgia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
cedartown.
is
that
normal,
that
something
is
outrageously
and
wantonly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
did
this
come
straight
from
the
judge's
charge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
finding
that
and/or
is
a
sufficient
finding
under
charge
of
law,
that
the
man
is
either
guilty
or
not
guilty
or
what?
where
do
you
have
a
finding
that
uses
"or"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
asked
you
whether
it
was
outrageously
or
wantonly,
and
you
cannot
answer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i
ask
you,
is
it
one
or
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
is
sufficient
to
take
a
man's
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
the
question
that
was
presented
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
would
wonder
why
we
grant
cert
in
this
case.
