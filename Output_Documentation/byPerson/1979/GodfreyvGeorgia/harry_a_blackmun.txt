justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that
option
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
this
case
under
your
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
can
say
about
the
same
thing
of
any
pre-meditated
murder,
can
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
just
interrupt
you
one
more--in
connection
with
mr.
justice
stevens'
inquiry,
certainly
on
pages
80
and
81
the
presence
of
the
alternative
at
the
top
on
each
page,
to
fix
the
punishment
at
life,
would
indicate
that
this
is
a
printed
form
of
some
kind
or
at
least
a
typed
form
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
what
is
your
georgia
law
when
he
instructs
that
they
shall
designate
in
writing
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
they
do
not
other
than
to
use
the
form?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
the
jury
in
returning
that
form
in
each
case
complied
with
the
instructions
that
you
shall
designate
in
writing
the
aggravating
circumstances
which
you
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
i
do
not
see
any
circumstances
designated
other
than
stating
that
the
offense
of
murder
was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
interrupt
you
again.
i
take
it
this
report
or
this
form
of
the
trial
judge,
is
this
made
out
and
it
goes
to
the
appellate
court
in
your
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
thing
that
is
of
interest
to
me,
and
i
have
not
noticed
it
before,
was
this--this
is
question,
i
think
it
was
21.
was
the
victim
physically
harmed
or
tortured?
answer
-
no.
and
if
yes,
state
extent
of
harm
or
torture.
and
he
answers
that
saying,
"excluding
the
actual
murdering
of
the
two
victims."
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
a
formal
finding,
which
would
exclude
your
argument--insinuation
anyway--of
torture
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
obviously
used
it
in
forming
his
charge
obviously
because
of
that
bracket
that
is
on
page
86.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
be
just
the
reverse.
you
did
not
petition
for
cert.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
be
here
because
we
think
it
is
not
as
horrible
as
others.
