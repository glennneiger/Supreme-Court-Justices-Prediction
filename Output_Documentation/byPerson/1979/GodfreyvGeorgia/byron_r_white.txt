justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
holmes,
you
are
back
to
the
statute.
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
to
get
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
are
the
soft
words
in
the
statute
that
you
feel
are
improper?
is
it
depravity
of
mind
or
is
it
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
or
inhuman,
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
some
factors
here,
were
there
not?
i
take
it
they
were
not
argued.
but
the
fact
that
the
killing
was
before
the
young
child,
the
fact
that
there
were
two
murders,
not
one,
two,
and
the
fact
that--at
least
i
think
it
is
a
fact--that
he
forced
the
second
victim
to
anticipate
being
killed.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
argued
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
these
are
not
specifically
in
the
statute,
this
kind
of
thing,
killing
somebody
in
front
of
a
young
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
this,
instead
of
being
a
shotgun
murder,
had
been
just
a
clean
single-shot
pistol
through
the
heart.
would
you
not
be
here
making
this
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
implication
of
my
inquiry
of
course
is
whether
any
first
degree
murder
under
the
georgia
theory
would
fit
(b)(7),
any
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor,
at
least
in
his
closing
argument,
said
that
this
does
not
involve
torture
or
an
aggravated
battery
within
the
definition
of
the
statute,
but
only
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile
in
that
it
displayed
some
depravity
of
mind.
that
was
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
prosecutor
gives
notice
to
the
defendant
as
to
the
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
just
says
like
seven?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
not
give
formal
notice
to
the
defendant
as
precisely
as
he
argued
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
is
what
the
prosecutor
said.
you
know
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
his
closing
argument
on
page
75
of
the
appendix
-
"of
course
you
cannot
find
there
was
torture.
there
wasn't
any
torture."
that
is
his
argument
to
the
jury.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
jury
nevertheless
thought
there
might
be
torture
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
in
a
case
of
the
so-called
clean
rifle
shot
to
the
heart,
just
bang,
and
the
prosecutor
nevertheless
relies
on
(7)
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
and
the
jury
comes
back
and
finds
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say--and
there
is
an
eighth
amendment
challenge
to
that
in
the
sense
that
if
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
can
cover
this,
it
can
cover
anything.
and
so
you
are
back
to
unruled
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
does
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
ground?
what
would
we
say?
what
would
we
say,
that
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
we
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
construction
of
this
section
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
it
reaches
this
far,
and
therefore
it
could
reach
that
far
in
any
case,
and
it
is
void
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
can
you
do
if
we
happen
to
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
this
is
way
out
of
line
with
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
done
in
other
cases?
let
us
just
suppose
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
accept
that
it
was
and
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
seventh
circumstance
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
have
to
say
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
this
does
fit
within
that
meaning.
and,
therefore,
what
should
we
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
accept
that
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
question.
that
is
the
question
for
eighth
amendment
purposes,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
cannot
say
that
they
misconstrued
their
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
cannot
say
that.
they
are
in
charge
of
construing
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
these
facts,
whatever
they
are,
we
have
to
accept
as
being
deemed
outrageously
wanton
and
vile
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
do
not,
but
that
is
the
question
that
was
posed
to
be
argued
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
look
back
over
the
history
of
the
oversight
of
the
sentencing
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
you
find
that
in
every
single
one,
up
until
this
one,
when
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
is
relied
on,
any
guy
in
his
right
mind
would
think
it
was
an
outrageous
crime
and
it
was
really
bad.
and
let
us
assume
that
you
would
agree
that
in
every
one
but
this
one,
until
this
one,
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
applied
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
in
that
way.
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting
they
have
until
this
one?
you
have
just
said
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
them
where
they
had
life
sentences
on
facts
like
these.
