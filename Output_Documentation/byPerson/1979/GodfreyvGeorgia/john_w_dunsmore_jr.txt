mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1973
the
general
assembly
of
georgia,
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman,
felt
that
the
states
could
still
inflict
a
death
penalty,
providing
the
manner
in
which
they
did
so
set
forth
certain
articulate
standards.
in
march
of
1978
a
jury
in
polk
county
found
that
one
of
these
standards
had
been
complied
with,
based
upon
the
state's
case,
and
imposed
the
death
penalty
under
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance.
this
is
a
case
of
premeditated
murder.
the
district
attorney
on
that
basis
sought
the
death
penalty.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
some
of
the
facts
in
light
of
counsel's
going
over
those
facts.
while
there
was
an
altercation
between
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
some
three
weeks
prior
to
the
fatal
shootings,
that
altercation
also
involved
violence,
and
it
also
involved
a
weapon
capable
of
producing
death,
a
knife.
on
two
occasions,
on
the
5th
of
september,
the
petitioner
drew
a
knife
on
his
wife
the
first
time
to
make
her
remain
seated
at
a
couch
in
their
house,
and
the
second
time,
actually
used
that
knife
on
his
wife
in
the
bathroom
in
which
he
cut
her
clothes
to
and
through
some
of
her
underclothing,
although
there
was
no
apparent
physical
injury
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
all
right,
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
issues
in
this
matter
in
that
it
shows
a
predisposition
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
in
view
of
his
later
statement,
following
the
shootings,
when
he
said,
"i've
done
a
hideous
crime.
i've
thought
about
it
for
eight
years.
and
i'd
do
it
again.
or
i
was
glad
that
i
did
it."
we
need
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
even
though
there
had
been
some
phone
conversations
between
the
petitioner
and
his
wife,
there
appears
to
be
a
sufficient
interval,
which
the
jury
considered,
where
there
would
have
been
a
cooling
off
of
any
passions.
the
killing
takes
place
at
night.
the
petitioner
is
able
to
lurk
in
the
back
of
this
trailer,
has
the
advantage
of
lights
on
so
that
he
can
silhouette,
pick
out
his
target.
he
used
what
was
called
an
over
and
under
shotgun
combination
rifle.
that
means
he
could
have
use
the
rifle,
but
he
chose
instead
to
use
the
shotgun.
and
it
is
pretty
hard
at
five
or
six
feet
to
miss
with
broad
pattern
of
a
shotgun.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
am
not
too
sure.
i
think
it
was
a
20
gauge.
i
believe
that
is
a
20
gauge
over
and
under.
but
he
had
that
option.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
no,
i
am
not
too
sure.
but
i
think
it
is
an
essential
fact
because
i
think
what
makes
this
case
outrageously
and
wantonly
vile
and
inhuman
is
the
cold-blooded,
calculated
course
of
action
which
the
petitioner
embarked
in
from
the
beginning
with
an
avowed
purpose
to
cause
death.
the
type
of
weapon
he
used
is
evidence
of
his
intention
of
inflicting
a
fatal
injury.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
yes,
but
the
statute,
the
seventh
aggravating
statute,
as
defined
by
our
court
in
harris,
looks
to,
as
they
said,
the
core--not
the
core,
but
the
core
cases
like
pitlis,
like
they
used
in
state
v.
dixon
in
florida.
we
are
not
looking
at
a
common
killing,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
suggested.
we
are
looking
at
a
killing
where
there
was
an
avowed,
a
conscientious
decision
made
some
time
even
before
he
arrived
at
the
trailer
to
inflict
grievous
bodily
harm.
now--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
this
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
looks
at
the
more
heinous
aspects
of
it.
now,
there
can
be
some
overlapping--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
that
they
are
all--the
taking
of
any
life
would
be--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no.
they
are
senseless
killings,
but
some
are
more
senseless
than
others,
particularly
when
there
is
no
avenue
of
escape;
that
is,
there
is
no
right
to
defend,
no
opportunity
to
defend
against
this
course
of
action
at
all.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
believe
that
goes
a
far
way
in
making
our
point,
sir.
i
really
do.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
is
what
makes
this
case
so
outrageously
and
wantonly
vile.
for
example,
the
outrageous
nature
of
the
case
is
the
fact
that
it
is
heinous
and
atrocious
and
it
offends
human
standards
on
the
basis
that
an
individual--these
individuals--
had
no
opportunity
to
defend
themselves.
we
have
the
wantonness,
that
is,
the
aspect
of
the
merciless
killing
where
he
comes
in
a
trailer,
a
small
area.
we
certainly
do
have
torture
in
the
terms
of
the
anticipation
of
death,
as
we
argued
in
our
brief,
which
is
a
mental
torture;
i
think
the
statute
could
include
that.
and
our
supreme
court
in
the
floyd
case,
involving
an
armed
robbery,
double
execution
style
killing,
where
the
mother
and
daughter
were
separated
for
the
purposes
of
determining
where
the
money
was
in
the
house,
paraded
the
individuals
around
the
house,
and
then
before
the
second
killing
the
daughter
witnesses
her
mother
being
killed,
knowing
that
she
is
next
on
the
list,
so
to
speak.
and
in
this
case
the
evidence
shows
that
when
the
wife
was
shot
in
the
head--and
i
think
that
is
another
point
that
shows
premeditation.
both
victims
were
shot
in
the
head,
not
like
trying
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
or
just
to
do
some
injury
to
them.
in
intent--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
believe
that
this
was
the
form
that
was
given
to
them
by
the--and
prepared
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
but
on
page
79
the
judge
instructs--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
of
the
appendix--instructed
the
complete
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
it
usually
does.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
and
that
is
the
proceeding
that
usually
goes
out
in
writing
because
they
must
designate.
and
it
is
a
possibility,
for
example,
in
some
cases
more
than
one
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
may
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
for
example,
it
is
conceivable
under
the
facts
in
this
case
that
they
could
have
found
in
the
course
of
one
of
the
murders.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
could
infer.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
the
only
significance
that--i
do
not
attach
any
significance
to
it
other
than
the
fact--and
i
cannot
explain
why
he
may
have
put
those
there--other
than
maybe
it
was
a
mental
exercise,
and
he
was
trying
to
parrot
the
jury's
finding,
as
appears
on
page
80
of
the
appendix.
in
examining
this
case
as
to
the--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
am
not
too
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
they
did
comply
with
it.
and
the
reason
i
say
they
complied
with
it,
in
that
they
found
or
the
instruction
was
submitted
to
them
in
this
form--i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
or
basically
one
reason
perhaps
why
they
should
designate
in
writing
and
why
the
court
also
submits
for
them,
for
their
guidance.
and
that
probably
is
that
when
jurors
are
given
instructions,
there
is
a
lot
that
they
have
to
remember.
in
a
death
case,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
jury's
discretion
is
channeled
and
that
they
find
within
the
terms
of
whatever
aggravating
circumstance
or
circumstances
are
are
given
to
them.
and
i
believe
that
is
generally
the
reason
why
the
prosecutors
prepare
the--a
form
ahead
of
time
for
the
juries.
it
is
to
assist
in
arriving
at
their--to
make
sure
they
use
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
would
be--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
tell
us
how
they
were
prepared;
that
is,
whether
they
were
typed
up
at
the
direction
of
the
judge,
the
state's
attorney,
or
by
the
jurors.
i
believe
that
if
they
are
in
writing--and
my
memory
escapes
because
i
have
been
reading
from
the
appendix--if
they
were
in
writing,
more
than
likely--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
longhand,
probably
by
the
jury.
and
if
they
were
typed
out
ahead
of
time,
most
likely
prepared
by
the
district
attorney
who
presided
over
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well,
they
found--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
they
found
all
of
all
of
it--i
know
it
is
used
in
the
word--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
believe
the
words
"outrageously"
or
"wantonly"
are
somewhat
synonymous.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
this
was
not
in
americus.
this
was
in
cedartown.
but--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
outrageous
or
wanton?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
the
judge's
charge
uses
those
words.
the
state
prosecutor
uses
those
words.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
am
not
too
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
it
is
all
of
them,
although
it
could
be
one
or
the
other.
but
i
think
it
is
all
of
them.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well,
it
is
sufficient
to
take
a
man's
life
when
the
facts
support
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
we
contend
they
do
support
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
i
were
called
in
the
opinion
and
the
court
said
we
find
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
applied
too
broadly
or
too
vague--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
per
se,
i
would
say,
because
the
jury
in
gregg
did
not
even
return
that
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
only
submits
those
aggravating
circumstances
which
the
prosecutor
has
put
the
defendant
on
notice
that
he
would
seek
the
death
penalty
on,
only
those.
it
may
be
one,
it
may
be
two.
and
i
suppose
in
some
instances
it
could
be
three.
but
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
was
what--those
are
the
words,
and
it
is
in
the
appendix.
that
is
what
he--that
is
what--that
is
how
he
phrased
it.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
generally
i
would
say--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
i
do
not
know.
but
i
would
not
say
he
would
have
to
set
out
word
for
word.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
put
him
on
notice
that
i
am
seeking
the
death
penalty
under
the
second
aggravating
circumstance,
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance.
and
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
incident
where
any
lawyer
appointed
would
not,
if
he
did
not
know
it,
number
two
or
number
seven,
would
not
go
and
look
at
the
statute
in
title
xxvii
to
see
just
exactly
what
it
was,
what
it
involved.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
would
because
i
think
this
is
the
judge's--how
he
puts
it
in
his
own
terms.
he
makes
a--it
is
sort
of
like
an
evaluation
to
go
along.
and
this
goes
with
the
record
for
the
georgia
supreme
court--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
there
may
be--and
there
probably
is
some
inconsistency
because
i
think
the
facts
would
show
that
there
is
some
torture,
at
least
the
anticipation
of
death
as
to
the
mother-in-law.
and
perhaps
the
judge
at
that
time--many
of
us
think
of
torture
in
the
terms
of
the
mccorquodale
sense
or
the
dix
sense
where
they
are
taking
a
knife
or
cutting
a
person.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
it
could
be
because
the
jury
the
law
not
from
the
district
attorney
and
his
argument,
but
from
the
judge.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
prior
to
the
noon
break,
there
was
reference
made
on
page
87
of
the
appendix
to--in
question
21
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
report
in
which
he
checked
"no"
after
the
phrase
"was
the
victim
physically
harmed
or
tortured?"
and
then
he
adds
on
"if
yes,
state
extent
of
harm
or
torture
-
excluding
the
actual
murdering
of
the
two
victims."
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
thought
in
his
mind.
it
is
his
reflection.
he
qualifies
it,
saying
there
is
definitely
physical
harm
to
the
victims.
and
i
think
the
record
more
than
adequately
establishes
that
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
wounds
to
these
two
victims.
we
have
argued
and
still
maintain,
consistently
maintain,
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
when
it
conducts
its
review,
as
mandated
by
our
general
assembly,
carefully
goes
over
the
facts
to
make
sure
that
they
are
supported
by
a
reasonable
doubt,
compares
them
with
similar
cases,
and
then
also
looks
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
any
arbitrariness
or
discrimination
or
prejudice
in
the
case.
we
have
had
the
argument
by
petitioner
that
(b)(7),
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance,
is
a
catch-all.
and
yet
we
have
had
language
by
our
court
in
harris
which
looked
for
guidance
from
the
dixon
case.
and
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
essential,
the
hardcore,
the
gruesome
type,
execution
type
slayings.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
all
right,
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
we
are,
justice
white.
and
this
is
why
i
say
we
are
not.
i
do
not
think
the
outcome
would
be
any
different
as
far
as
saying
unruly
discretion
because
if
that
individual
preplans
that
execution--and
let
us
say
that
he
does
it
with
a
single
shot
rifle
and
stands
on
the
top
of
a
building
and
waits
for
his
victim
to
come
to
look
and
pick
him
off--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
you
are
just
going
to
change
my
example.
i
will
posit
any
set
of
circumstances
that
you
require
to
say
that
section
7
should
not
reach
it.
but,
nevertheless,
it
is
relied
upon,
and
the
jury
finds
it.
and
it
is
affirmed.
what
could
we
do
about
it?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
when
you
say
it
is
affirmed,
you
are--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
facts
in
the
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
you
need
to
look
at
it,
does
it
fit
within
the
mold
of
the
other
cases,
similar
cases
which
have
arisen?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
if
it
does
not,
then
you
ought
to
reverse
it.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
would
say
that
is
probably
what
you
would
say
because
it
does
not
fit
in.
the
similarity--now,
the
similarity
goes
to--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
but
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
get
that
far
because
i
think
in
their
review
to
date,
they
have--all
of
the
cases
which
have
come
before
it
have
been
horrible
crimes.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
this
is
as
horrible
and
maybe
more
horrible
than
others
that
have.
but
the
only
reason
it
is
here
is
because
it
is
such
a
horrible
crime.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
all
right.
as
i
read
the
question
posed
in
this
case,
if
you
disagreed
that
this
case--the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
was
not
outrageously,
wantonly
and
vile,
then
what
you
would--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
if
you
say
it
does
fit
within
that
meaning?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
right.
and
if
it
fits
within
that
meaning,
then
you
should
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
presented
in
the
case.
if
i
understand
you--and
maybe
i
do
not
understand
your
question
correctly,
but
if
you
assume
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
correct,
the
facts
show
conduct
which
is
outrageously
and
wantonly
and
vile
and
that
they
have
not
too
broadly
construed
what
is
an
outrageous,
wanton,
and
vile
and
inhuman
killing--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think--i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
do
not
think
we
have
an
eighth
amendment
problem
because
i
think
the
facts
show--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
our
position
is
we
do
not
have
an
eighth
amendment
position
or
an
argument
against
it
in
this
aspect
because
this
is
a
crime
which
comes
down
in
a
well
defined
set
of
circumstances,
controlled
discretion
in
the
statute,
appellate
review
channeling,
making
sure
that
the
jury
does
not
go
off
on
some
tangent
within
the
state's
right
to
prescribe
the
death
penalty
for
certain
standards
of
conduct,
particularly
where
the
defendant
from
the
beginning
has
engaged
in
that
course
of
conduct
where
he
intends,
from
the
outset,
to
take
the
victim's
life,
different
from
the
fact
that
he
goes
in
and
he
robs
a
store
and
he
says,
"gee,
this
guy
might
be
able
to
identify
me."
so,
at
that
point.
here
we
have
before
he
even
gets
to
his
intended
victim
the
intent.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no,
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--in
harris
they
have--in
harris
they
said,
"we
view
the
words
'outrageously,
wantonly
vile'
as
applying
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
his
act"--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--"and
also
as
its
impact
upon
the
victim,"
which
is
illustrated
or
exemplified
by
either
torture,
aggravated
battery
or
depravity
of
mind.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
you
did
not
reach
it.
and
i
would
be
speculating
if
i--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no
question.
he
had
the
choice
between
the
weapons,
and
i
think
the
vileness
is
shown.
he
picked
the
weapon
which
would
do
the
greatest
damage
because
it
blew
both
their
heads
off
or
literally
reduced
them
to
a
pulp.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
and
i
say
that
it
would
because
those
words
are
sufficient
enough
to
put
a
defendant
on
notice
as
to
what
conduct
is
to
be
defended
against,
and
they
are
also
words--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
think
the
essential
words
of
the
statute
are
what
the
jury
found
and
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
said,
particularly
in
view
of
the
holton
case
where
they
just
had
depravity
of
mind.
thank
you.
