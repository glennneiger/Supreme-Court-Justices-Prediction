the
court
in
gregg
rejected
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
seventh
aggravating
circumstance
per
se,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
we
rejected
the
prosecutor's
whole
attack
upon
it.
justice
potter
stewart
per
se
on
its
language,
which
would
include
the--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
include
the
disjunctive
that
mr.
justice
marshall
has
just
called
to
your
attention--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
outrageously
or
wantonly.
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
find
that
in
gregg?
i
have
gregg
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart

the
text,

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
holmes,
you
filed
this
long
list
of
summaries
of
other
cases
in
which
the
death
sentence
was
not
imposed,
for
one
reason
or
another.
justice
potter
stewart
in
some
of
these
cases
i
notice
there
was
no
authorization
to
impose
the
death
sentence
at
the
time
of
these
convictions.
for
one
reason
or
another
the
death
sentence
was
not
imposed
in
these
cases,
summaries
of
which
you
filed,
and
there
are
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
two
hundred
and
some.
what
is
the
argumentative
purpose
of
this?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that
does
not
really
answer
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
with
other
cases
in
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
were
these
all
on-appeal
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
these
were
appealed,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
point
of
this
list,
the
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
these
was
a
death
sentence?
