chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
godfrey
against
georgia.
o
mr.
holmes,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
these
things
you
are
telling
us,
mr.
holmes,
were
advanced
to
persuade
the
jury
to
a
contrary
conclusion,
i
take
it.
the
jury
did
not
accept
this
defense,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
that
shooting
at
about
a
five
or
six
foot
range
with
a
shotgun,
blowing
the
head
off
of
a
victim
in
the
presence
of
two
other
potential
victims,
one
of
whom
became
a
victim,
is
not
an
aggravated
battery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
just
deprived
two
people
of
their
heads.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
certainly
is
at
least
as
bad
as
chopping
off
an
arm
or
a
leg,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
do
you
say
that
the
phrase
in
the
statute
"aggravated
battery"
does
not
embrace
what
took
place
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
we
not
assume
reasonably
that
a
jury
could
have
reasonably
thought
it
fit
these
adjectives
because
it
was
in
effect
an
execution
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
next
victim
and
even
a
possible
third
victim?
apart
from
the
manner,
whether
it
was
injection
of
some
drug
or
shooting
with
the
shotgun
or
a
clean
rifle
bullet,
the
very
nature
of
the
staging
of
it,
an
execution
style
murder--does
that
not
fall
within
the
language
"vile,
outrageous,
wanton"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
statute
apparently
reaches
out
for
something
that
is
a
little
more
than
just
an
ordinary
killing,
as
was
suggested
by
a
clean
bullet
shot
through
the
heart.
is
that
not
what
this
statute
is
trying
to
reach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
it
is
construed
somewhere
else
that
way
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
how
it
was
applied
in
this
case
is
all
we're
are
concerned
with,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
thought
you
had
just
agreed
that
this
was
outrageous,
vile,
horrible,
and
inhuman.
you
did
not
agree
on
the
aggravated
battery
part,
but
you
have
agreed
that
as
to
these
parts,
it
fits
the
statute,
the
events
of
this
case.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
we
agree
here.
it
is
a
question
of
what
a
jury
could
reasonably
conclude.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
holmes.
mr.
dunsmore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
bear
on
whether
he
should
have
been
acquitted
or
found
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
or
in
mitigation;
but
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
the
issues
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
make
your
point
when
you
say
he
planned
it
for
a
year
in
advance
and
after
the
event
said
that
he
would
do
it
again
if
he
had
the
chance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
murders
are
not
accompanied
by
that
kind
of
before
and
after
sequence,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
did
not
use
all
of
the
language
of
the
statute
though.
the
original
record
is
lodged
in
the
court
here,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
that
include
the
two
sheets
of
paper
that
were
signed
by
the
jury
foreman
and
to
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
referring?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
tell
us
whether
those
were
typed
up
at
the
direction
of
the
jurors,
the
foreman,
or
how
they
happened
to
be
prepared.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
longhand,
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
terms
"outrageously"
and
"wantonly,"
both
in
the
statute
and
in
that
form,
are
adjectives
to
the
terms,
the
words
"vile,"
"horrible,"
or
"inhuman,"
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
holmes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
prosecution
carried
its
burden
if
it
shows
that
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
the
particular
case
fit
in
any
one
of
these
categories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
facts
show
that
it
fits
any
one
of
them,
even
though
as
a
practical
matter
we
know--probably
i
do--if
it
fits
one,
it
is
likely
to
fit
more.
but
if
it
just
fits
one,
does
that
not
meet
the
prosecution's
burden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
fits
one,
has
the
prosecution
met
its
burden
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
may
be.
any
one
of
us
might
have
that
subjective
reaction.
but
12
presumably
representative
citizens
of
georgia
concluded
that
it
did
fit
under
at
least
one
of
these,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
