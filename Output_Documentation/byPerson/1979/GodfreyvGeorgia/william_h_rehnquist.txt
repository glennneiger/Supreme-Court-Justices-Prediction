justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
get
to
a
certain
point
where
you
have
to
use
general
language
just
because
of
the
instances
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
blackmun?
it
is
simply
impossible
to
foresee
all
the
manners
in
which
killings
can
take
place,
and
you
have
to
use
some
fairly
general
rubric
in
order
to
express
what
you
mean
over
and
above
murder
in
the
first
degree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
georgia
legislation,
instead
of
saying
vile,
wanton
and
inhuman,
had
said
committed
in
front
of
a
small
child
or
committed
on
a
second
person
ten
seconds
after
it
was
committed
on
the
first
person;
what
you
say,
would
not
comprise
torture.
would
that
satisfy
your
objections?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
point
is
that
just
the
range
of
human
experience
suggests
that
you
are
not
going
to
have
a
whole
catalog
before
you
of
the
circumstances
over
and
above
first
degree
murder,
which
may
lead
to
a
permissible
capital
offense
and
that
some
generalization
is
necessary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
gauge
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
seventy-nine
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
dunsmore,
i
take
it
that
the
typical
sentencing,
the
charging
form
in
a
capital
case
in
georgia
the
judge
is
not
obligated--in
fact,
it
would
probably
be
error
to
charge
on
all
of
the
ten
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
for
instance,
i
know
section
1
says
it
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
if
the
murder
was
committed
by
a
person
who
has
a
substantial
history
of
serious
assault,
of
criminal
convictions.
if
the
defendant
who
is
being
tried
did
not
have
such
a
history,
the
judge
would
not
submit
that
to
the
jury,
would
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if,
following
mr.
justice
white's
question,
all
of
the
cases
affirming
death
penalties
in
georgia
under
aggravating
circumstances,
number
seven,
had
been
like
mccorquodale
except
this
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
until
this
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
a
not-for-profit
death
by
execution
style
murder
could
not
fit
within
the
language
of
section
7?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
if
the
georgia
supreme
court
says
a
not-for-profit,
gangland,
execution
type
killing
fits,
any
first
degree
murder
fits
even
though
it
is
a
clean
rifle
shot?
