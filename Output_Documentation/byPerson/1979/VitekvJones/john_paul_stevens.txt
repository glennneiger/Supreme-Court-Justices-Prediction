justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
when
was
the
decision
made
on
mootness?
was
this
the
opinion
in
october
of
1978?
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
he
was
not
in
danville,
but
he
was
then
on
parole,
wasn't
he?
and
wasn't
the
theory
of
the
three-judge
court,
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
parole
was,
he
had
to
submit
himself
for
psychiatric
examination
upon
request;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
he'd
violated
his
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
was
on
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
on
parole.
and
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
said
larry
jones
is
now
on
parole,
but
he
is
subject
to
and
under
the
threat
of
transfer
to
the
state
mental
hospital
for
examination,
study
and
treatment.
apparently
--
and
that's
apparently
their
basis
for
being--saying
it
isn't
moot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
can't--you
won't
cure
the
collateral
consequence
that's
already
happened
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
have
a
live
controversy,
you
must
say
that
the
risk
of
his
being
transferred
again
is
real
enough
to
call
it
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kammerlohr
told
us
i
think
earlier
that
he
had
escaped,
was
it
from
illinois
to
arkansas,
and
has
now
been
returned
to
prison
in
nebraska.
was
either
the
escape
or
return
connected
with
any
aberrant
behavior?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
there
must
be
a
finding
that
he
has
a
mental
disease
or
defect
before
he
may
be
transferred
to
the
hospital;
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that;
i
understand
that.
but
you
may
not
be
the
--
the
prison
authorities
just
may
not
transfer
him
to
the
mental
hospital
without
making
this
kind
of
a
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wurtz,
will
you
identify
the
injunction
that
is
still
in
effect?
is
it
the
one
that's
on
page
19
of
the
appendix?
i
guess
it's
the
jurisdictional
statement;
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
may
be
in
the
appendix,
but
i'm
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
statement.
ended
october
27,
1978.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
still
in
effect,
your
client
can't
be
transferred
without
the
hearing
that's
described
in
that
injunction,
can
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
are
you
complaining?
aren't
you
satisfied
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
defending
that
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
i
should
think
you'd
be
happy
to
have
us
say
it
is
moot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
have
the
injunction,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
fact
is
you've
got
a
state
statute
that
puts
conditions--
that
imposes
preconditions
that
depends
on
the
ascertainment--that
depends
on
facts.
and
the
state
statute
says
there
must
be
some
events
occur
before
this
transfer
can
happen.
that
is
not
meachum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
three-judge
court
proceeded,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
want
to
make
that
argument?
