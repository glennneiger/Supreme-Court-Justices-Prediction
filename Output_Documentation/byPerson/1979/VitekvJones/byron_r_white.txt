justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true
of
any
prisoner.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that;
forget
the
injunction
for
a
moment.
you
think
that
--
i'll
ask
you
this
way.
except
for
the
injunction,
would
nebraska
now
transfer
him
to
the
mental
institution,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
his
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
the
three-judge
court
think
this
case
wasn't
moot?
we
remanded
to
see
if
it
was
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
plus
the
fact
that
the
state
asserted
the
right
to
transfer
him
to
a
hospital
on
short
notice,
didn't
it?
it
seeks
to
have
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
as
far
as
you
could
tell
or
any
doctor
could
tell,
your
client
was
completely
cured?
he
wouldn't
be
any
different
than
any
other
inmate.
and
just
any
inmate
couldn't
raise
an
issue
about
these
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
now,
tell
me
why
--
tell
me
what
substance
there
is
--
the
fact
that
it
happened
to
him
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
condition
hasn't
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
certainly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
narrowest
way
for
you
to
win.
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
climb
a
higher
hill
than
you
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
something
created
by
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wurtz,
i
realize--jones
was
convicted
of
robbery,
i
believe,
wasn't
it?
a
felony?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
applies
to
people
in
custody
of
the
department
of
corrections.
who
does
that
encompass?
does
that
encompass
people
convicted
of
misdemeanors,
by
any
chance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
a
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
entitle
the
judge
to
sentence
the
misdemeanant
to
the
custody
of
the
department
of
corrections?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
statutory
scheme
would
authorize
transfer
of
such
a
person
as
well
as
a
felon
to
a
mental
institution?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
as
i
understand,
the
case
was
originally
certified
as
a
class
action,
then
decertified,
and
now
it's
simply
an
individual
action
by
jones,
is
that
it?
why
was
it
decertified?
what
happened
on
the
class
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
enough
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
only
that,
but
that--you
must
concede
that
all
1,300
of
them
didn't
have
a
case
or
controversy
with
the
state
over
the
validity
of
that
statute.
not
just
anybody
could
have
walked
in
and
challenged
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
concede
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
concede
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wurtz,
i'd
like
to
follow
through
on
that
a
little
bit.
it's
your
position
that
going
to
a
hospital,
be
it
a
state
hospital--we
used
to
call
them
institutions
for
the
criminally
insane,
but
they
don't
anymore--is
worse
than
being
incarcerated
in
some
state
prisons
that
we
know
of
today?
isn't
this
an
old
notion
that
is
out
of
line
with
current
medical
attitudes?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
also
think
it
might
help
to
try
to
win
your
case
for
your
client
on
the
narrowest
possible
grounds,
which
we
usually
turn
to
if
they're
the
narrowest
grounds.
the
narrowest
constitutional
grounds
there
is.
and
you're
arguing
that
the
constitution
itself
requires
a
hearing,
even
aside
from
the
state
statute
is
a
very
broad
ground
that
this
court
hasn't
gotten
close
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
more
of
a
stigma
than
being
in
a
state
penitentiary?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
with
the
district
of
nebraska.
the
question
is
whether
a
state
prisoner
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
when
he
is
declared
to
be
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
or
defect
and
transferred
to
a
mental
hospital
for
a
treatment
that
is
not
available
in
the
prison.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
a
hearing
and
specified
the
procedures
to
be
included
in
--
in
the
hearing
including
a
holding
that
counsel
was
required.
because
of
the
question
of
mootness,
we
postponed
the
--
the
question
of
jurisdiction
to
the
merits
and
heard
oral
argument.
as
indicated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
a
majority
of
five
justices
holds
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
we
then
agree
with
the
district
court
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
a
prisoner
about
to
be
transferred
to
a
mental
hospital
is
entitled
to
notice
and
a
hearing,
to
be
present,
offer
testimony
and
cross-examined,
and
they'll
have
an
independent
maker
and
a
written
statement
of
the
evidence
and
the
reasons
for
the
transfer.
four
of
us,
justices
brennan,
marshall,
stevens,
and
i,
also
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
prisoner
is
entitled
with
the
help
of
counsel.
mr.
justice
powell,
however,
has
indicated
in
his
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
would
require
a
competent
help
for
the
prisoner
but
not
necessarily
a
licensed
attorney.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
accordingly
modified
in
this
respect
and
is
modified
that
it
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
filed
dissenting
opinions
on
the
jurisdictional
aspect
of
the
case.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined
mr.
justice
stewart.
