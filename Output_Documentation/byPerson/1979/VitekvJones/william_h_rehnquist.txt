justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
there
a
case
in
controversy
about
that
at
this
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
understand
that.
but
why
was
there
jurisdiction--why
is
there
any
longer
a
live
controversy?
i
know
he's
in
prison,
but
just
any
prisoner
in
a
nebraska
prison
wouldn't
have
a
case
or
controversy
with
the
state
of
nebraska
with
respect
to
the
provisions
to
transfer
to
a
mental
institution.
why
would
this
man?
because
he's
been
transferred
before,
and
is
he
about
to
be
again,
or
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
know,
but
if
there's
no
case
or
controversy
left,
if
the
case
is
mooted,
what
you
would
do
is,
you
would
vacate
the
district
court's
judgment,
and
dismiss
it,
dismiss
the
case.
i
just
want
to
know,
is
there
still
a--and
it's
a
jurisdictional
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
you
can't
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
you
can't
say,
you
don't
mean
it's
a
state
secret
that
you
can't
reveal,
but
just
that
you
simply
never
know
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
until
something
happens
whether
it'll
be
done
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
like
any
other
inmate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
like
any
other
inmate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
both
parties,
if
there
weren't
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
of
article
iii
would
like
a
ruling,
since
any
district
judge
sitting
in
nebraska
is
going
to
see
that
the
eighth
circuit,
when
it
does
have
an
actual
case
or
controversy,
will
probably
rule
the
way
the
three
--
judge
court
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
remove
the
article
iii
requirement
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
nor
so
far
as
it
is
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
just
assumed
that
because
he
was
on
parole
and
he
had
violated
his
parole,
that
the
case
wasn't
moot;
is
that
all
they
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
seeks
--
of
course
it's
always
sought
to
have
that
right,
long
before
the
injunctive
proceedings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
vacate
--
just
--
if
we
vacate
this
as
moot,
then
i
take
it
if
you
did
try
to
transfer
him,
he
could--his
lawyer
could
no
doubt
go
into
court
and
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
right
away
on
the
authority
of
this
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
true
or
any
other
prisoner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
you
have
a
new
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
a
new
district
court
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
unless
you
have
a
new
district
court
judge
in
nebraska
who
interprets
the
constitution
differently
than
this
three-judge
court
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
this
case
different
from
weinstein
against
bradford?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
the
case
where
there
had
been
an
injunction
entered
by,
i
think,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
against
certain
prison
practices
in
connection
with
parole,
and
meanwhile,
the
man's
parole
expired.
and
we
granted
certiorari
and
then
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot,
because
the
man
was
no
longer
under
the
same
threat
that
he
had
been
at
the
time
the
case
was
decided.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
hasn't
been
transferred
to
the
mental
hospital.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not
what
your
opponent
says.
your
opponent
says,
it
just
depends
on
what
happens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
could
be,
but
would
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
none
of
us
can.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
he's
a
sun
worshipper.
[laughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
didn't
say
it
was
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
requires
it.
the
statute
requires
it.
and
you're
suggesting
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
because
the
statute
requires
it,
there
should
be
a
hearing
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
state
provision
gives
you
a
state
right
to
have
some
sort
of
a
hearing
before
you're
transferred,
and
that
because
the
state
gives
you
that
much
of
a
right,
the
constitution
requires
you--the
state
to
go
further
and
to
have
more
amplified
hearing
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
the
district
court's
basis,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
even
though
the
state
of
nebraska
required
no
finding
by
a
physician,
and
simply
left
it
in
the
discretion
of
prison
officials
to
transfer
an
inmate
to
a
mental
hospital,
that
he
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
before
that
could
be
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
--
the
statutory
scheme
also
requires
the
physician's
review
in
the
case
of
a
transfer
to
a
mental
hospital,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
he's
already
been
sentenced
for
a
criminal
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've
held,
certain
in
meachum
v.
fano,
that
the
transfer
from
one
prison
to
another
doesn't
give
rise
to
any
constitutional
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
could
also
argue
that
the
two
million
people
who
live
in
nebraska
are
under
a
somewhat
more
attenuated
threat
of
committing
a
crime,
being
convicted
for
it,
being
confided
to
the
prison
system,
and
then
suffering
this
fate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
might
move
to
nebraska.
[laughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
won't
even
concede
that,
will
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wurtz,
my
recollection
is
that
your
client
has
a
sentence
that
runs
into
the
eighties,
what
is
it,
'82,
or--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
nebraska,
in
weinstein
against
bradford,
the
man
had
already
suffered
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
felt
was
unconstitutional
harm.
and
we
nonetheless
vacated
as
moot,
with
the
thought
i
believe
expressed
by
my
colleague
justice
white
that
you
can't
undo
collateral
consequences
in
the
past.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
just
disturbed
about
your
constant
reference
to
stigma,
because
i
think
stigma
in
1979
is
far
less
than
it
was
in
1900.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
a
narrower
--
a
much
narrower
ground
that
you
argue
in
your
brief.
the
three
--
judge
court
decided
on
that
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
defending
the
three
--
judge
court
opinion
or
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
stick
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
they
didn't
have
to?
the
--
i
suppose
the
notion
in
judging
constitutional
cases
is
that
you
do
decide
as
narrow
a
constitutional
question
as
you
can.
that's
the
characteristic
way.
or
don't
you
teach
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
apparently
you
don't.
you're
argument
is
that
it's
not
chic
to
have
a
psychiatrist
in
scott's
bluff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
i
meant
to
say
was
that
you
were
arguing
that
must
because
it
may
be
thought
chic
in
some
perhaps
metropolitan
areas
for
a
person
to
have
a
psychiatrist,
it
was
not
viewed
that
way
in
most
of
nebraska.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
constitution
vary
--
federal
constitutional
right
--
vary
from
state
to
state?
if
in
new
york
city
it's
thought
chic
to
have
a
psychiatrist,
so
there's
no
stigma,
but
in
southeastern
nebraska,
it's
not
thought
chic,
so
there
is
a
constitutional
right?
