chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
vitek
against
jones.
mr.
kammerlohr,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it's
clear
that
at
the
time
the
three-judge
court
acted,
he
was
still
in
the
va
hospital
in
illinois?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
soon
after--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't
object
to
that,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
it
a
live
case
at
this
point?
is
nebraska
threatening
to
transfer
him
again
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
if
he
developed
tuberculosis,
they
might
transfer
him
to
an
institution
where
they
could
treat
his
tuberculosis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
pure
speculation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
all
you
want
is
to
have
the
injunction
lifted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
can
get
a
rule
beyond
that,
so
much
the
better?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
the
time
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
clarify
the
question
i
put
to
you
at
the
outset.
at
the
time
the
three-judge
court
decision
came
down,
was
he
still
in
the
va
hospital
in
illinois,
or
had
he
violated
his
parole
and
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
situation
has
changed
significantly
since
then
by
reason
of
his
escape
and
then
his
apprehension?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he's
back
where
he
was
before
this
controversy
ever
arose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wurtz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
question
arise
until
they
try
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
now
in
a
penal
institution,
isn't
he,
a
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
what's
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
he's
still
under
a
threat
that
if
he
develops
tuberculosis
he
might
be
transferred
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
of
tuberculosis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
come
back
to
my
question,
which
i'm
not
sure
you
addressed
yet.
suppose
the
prison
doctors
concluded
that
he
had
developed
tuberculosis.
is
it
your
position
that
they
must
have
adversary
hearings
before
they
can
transfer
him
to
a
hospital
to
treat
the
tuberculosis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
being
a
christian
scientist
is
not
part
of
my
hypothetical.
just
this
man,
unless
you
tell
us
he's
a
christian
scientist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
is
must
there
be
a
hearing
before
he
is
moved
from
the
prison
to
the
hospital
for
the
treatment
of
his
tuberculosis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
constitution
does,
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
claim
here
is
that
the
nebraska
statutes
themselves
put
some
preconditions
on
a
transfer
to
a
mental
institution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know,
but
they
require
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
don't
want
to
have
to
go
back
in
court
if
they
move
him
over
to
lincoln,
nebraska
again.
if
they
move
him
from
where
he
is
to
lincoln,
nebraska,
you
don't
want
the
burden
of
going
in
to
get
another
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there's
no
state
remedy
in
this
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
do
you
think
there's
no
state
court
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don't
nebraska,
the
nebraska
state
courts,
entertain
a
challenge
on
the
federal
constitutional
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
state
statute
which,
i
take
it
from
these
papers,
that
it's
never
been
construed
by
the
state
courts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
might
construe
it
just
the
way
you
want
it
construed;
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
you
could
have
got
it
through
the
state
courts
in
18
months.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
the
state
courts
would
not
enforce
the
federal
constitution,
or
consider
your
constitutional
attack?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
worse
than
his
efforts
to
set
himself
on
fire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
obviously,
from
your
argument,
i'm
afraid
you
haven't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
lawyers
keep
coming
up
to
this
court
saying
it's
a
stigma,
they
probably
will
help
to
keep
it
a
stigma,
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
small
town?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
wurtz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
78-1155,
of
vitek,
correctional
director
against
jones
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
