mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
here
presented
for
review
is
whether
or
not
larry
jones
may
be
transferred
from
the
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex,
which
is
the
state
penitentiary
in
lincoln,
nebraska,
to
the
lincoln
regional
center,
which
is
the
state
mental
hospital,
which
is
also
located
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
it
arose--they
did
do
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
has
been
sent
back
to
the
penal
institution.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
our
contention
is,
your
honor,
this
is
still
a
very
viable
and
live
controversy,
for
the
reason
that
he
is
still
under
the
threat,
as
the
district
court
found
below,
of
being
transferred
back.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
might
be
true,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
precisely
the
issue
we
face
here
today
in
court.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
for
one,
larry
jones
is
not
on
parole.
so
therefore
his
parole
had
not
expired.
he
has
been
sent
back
from
the
limited
parole
that
he
did
have
at
the
mental
hospital
in
danville,
illinois,
back
to
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
would
be
transferred,
it
is
our
contention,
but
for
the
fact
that
a
three-judge
federal
panel
has
entered
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
if
this
injunction,
that
we
have
from
the
three-judge
federal
panel,
were
to
be
dissolved
by
this
court,
or
by
the
three-judge
federal
panel,
we
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
transferred
back,
he
could
be
transferred
back
to
the
mental
hospital.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
can't
see
into
the
future,
your
honor;
i
don't
have
a
crystal
ball.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
but
it
seems
to
be
one
of
those
cases
which
seems
to
be
capable
of
repetition,
yet
it
would
be
evading
review
if
this
court
would
not
decide
that
issue
here
today.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
he
isn't
just
any
other
inmate.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it's
happened
to
him
before.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
sat
over
there
--
that's
right,
he
sat
over
there
for
nine
months.
he
has
had
all
of
the
collateral
consequences
that
will
ensue
from
having
to
be
in
the
mental
institution
in
the
first
place.
and
he
still
has
a
threat
of
that
hanging
over
his
head.
now,
i
can't
get
into
his
mind
and
tell
you
exactly
how
he
feels
or
anything.
but
it's
just
that
type
of
collateral
consequence
that
is
still
existing.
and
for
that
reason,
we
feel
that
there's
still
a
spirit
of
controversy
here.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that's
true.
but
the
mere
fact
that
those
consequences
have
already
happened,
and
the
fact
that
they
might
happen
again,
and
i
think
coupled
with
the
fact
that
that
is
still
hanging
over
his
head,
makes
it
still
a
very
good
and
live
controversy.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
your
honor.
and
i
think
those
risks
are
real
enough
by
the
mere
fact
that
had
this
three
--
judge
court
not
entered
the
injunction,
he
would
still
be
incarcerated
in
the
state
mental
hospital.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
as
i
understand
the
factual
situation
--
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
somewhat
murky,
because
mr.
jones
was
having
some
mental
problems
at
the
time,
and
frankly,
he
cannot
really
remember
some
of
the
things
that
happened.
one
day
he
was
in
denver,
and
i
received
a
call
from
him.
and
i
said,
well,
you
know,
why
aren't
you
in
danville,
illinois.
the
next
time
i
heard
from
him,
he
was
in
arizona.
and
he
had
gotten
to
see
someone
in
denver
at
a
hospital,
talked
to
a
parole
officer.
but
then
he
ended
up
--
next
time
i
heard
from
him,
he
was
in
arizona.
then
the
next
time
i
heard
from
him,
he
had
been
extradited
from
arizona,
and
he
had
been
sent
back
to
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
don't
know;
he
might
be.
but
maybe
he
left
because
he
didn't
like
the
mental
hospital.
i
don't
know.
but
one
important
point
i
think
should
be
noted
here,
the
court
here,
it
was
my
understanding,
determined
it
was
moot
last
time,
because
he
was
accepting
psychiatric
services.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
--
excuse
me,
it
was
remanded
to
consider
mootness.
but
it
was
my
understanding
from
the
argument
last
time
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
did
that
was
because
he
was
accepting
voluntary
psychiatric
treatment
at
the
state
hospital
in
danville,
but
at
the
time
the
three
--
judge
panel
entered
the
order
reinstating
the
injunction
october
27,
1978,
mr.
jones
was
no
longer
accepting
voluntary
psychiatric
treatment
in
danville,
illinois.
he
was
on
a
work
--
it's
actually
a
work-release
program
from
that
limited
parole.
so
he
was
not
receiving
psychiatric
treatment
voluntarily
at
the
time
the
three
--
judge
panel
reinstated
that
injunction.
so
we
--
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
three
--
judge
panel
should
have
reinstated
the
injunction
because
the
circumstances
had
actually
changed
from
the
time
that
we
were
up
here
in
court
arguing
the
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
would
depend
on
two
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
if
he
wanted
to
be
treated.
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
treated,
it
would
be
--
probably
if
i
was
representing
him,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
he
could
refuse
the
medical
treatment.
i
think
--
in
the
cases
involving
christian
scientists
and
other
religious
groups,
i
think
we
have
held
that
one
has
that
right
to
refuse
medical
treatment.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
argue
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
refuse
that
medical
treatment.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
the
statute
in
nebraska
does
not
specifically
provide
for
that
now
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
don't
know
that
that
issue
has
really
been
addressed.
i
personally
think,
if
he
does
not
really
want
to
be
operated
on,
or
have
his
tuberculosis
treated,
i
think
he
ought
to
have
that
right.
and
perhaps,
yes,
a
hearing
ought
to
be
mandated,
or
given
to
him
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
there
are
conditions.
they
allow
a
physician
to
make
that
finding.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
they
require
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that's
correct.
but
it's
also
our
contention
that
there
ought
to
be
some
type
of
independent
fact-finding.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
we
would
hope
that
they
would
make
some
type
of
a
determination.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
we
need
a
further
safeguard,
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
the
statute
requires
it,
that
therefore
we
have
a
hearing.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
you
don't
have
a
hearing
but
they
can
be
transferred.
what
we
are
saying,
we're
challenging
the
sufficiency
of
that
statute.
we're
saying,
yes,
there
is
a
safeguard
there,
but
that
safeguard
isn't
good
enough.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
there
ought
to
be
a
better
hearing.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no.
i'm
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
and
we
contend,
that
you
have
that
right
in
and
of
itself.
under
the
constitution.
but
i
also
think
it's
also
a
good
argument
that
if
you
would
want
to
categorize
this
type
of
case
in
the
framework
of
the
meachum
and
montanye
decisions,
that
there
be,
there
is
an
expectation
that
he
won't
be
transferred.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
guess
i'm
on
that
hill,
your
honor,
because
it
may
appear
from
reading
that
opinion
that
that
is
why
the
district
court
found
in
our
favor,
that
they
said
that
there
was
an
expectation
that
he
did
have
this.
he
could
find
from
looking
at
the
statute
that
there
is
an
expectation
there,
and
he
should
be
transferred.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
think
he
has
the
right,
though,
independent
of
the
expectation
given
to
him
by
state
law.
the
court
also
made
a
finding,
though,
and
it
was
interesting
though,
it
said
in
the
opinion
that
this
was
clearly
a
transfer
from
a
state
penal
complex
to
a
state
mental
hospital.
and
therefore
it
is
distinguished
and
different
from
the
meachum-type,
montanye-type
cases.
i
would
agree
--
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
on
that
narrow
a
basis.
but
should
this
court
feel
that
this
case
would
somehow
fit
within
that
framework
of
the
meachum
and
montanye
decisions,
i
think
there
is
an
expectation
there,
rooted
in
nebraska
state
law.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
a
statute,
i
believe
it's
83-176,
which
empowers
the
department
of
corrections
to
place
any
inmate
wherever
he
wants
to
put
him.
and--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
in
83-180,
subsection
1,
which
the
lower
court
found
unconstitutional.
but
we
contend
that
even
if
83-180
didn't
exist,
and
all
there
was
was
83-176,
which
gave
the
department
of
corrections
officer
the
ability
to
just
transfer
him
anywhere
he
wanted
to,
as
long
as
it
was
within
the
department
of
corrections,
that
he
has
that
--
that
fundamental
right;
it's
protected--it's
a
protected
liberty
interest
that
the
constitution
should
afford
him.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
why
should
his
rights
be
any
different
just
because
he
happens
to
be
in
a
prison?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
is
the
precise
difference
between
meachum
and
this
case.
this
is
not
a
transfer
from
one
prison
to
another.
it's
a
transfer
from
one
prison
to
a
mental
hospital.
before
it
was
called
the
lincoln
regional
center
it
was
called
the
nebraska
state
home
and
the
nebraska
hospital
for
the
insane.
this
isn't
a
meachum-type
case,
in
that
sense.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
injunction
is
still
left.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
right.
i
didn't
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
no,
because
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
--
because
it's
my
understanding
of
the
mootness
rule
here
in
the
supreme
court,
that
if
a
supreme
court
found
a
case
moot,
it
would
be
--
vacated
the
lower
injunction.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
guess
that's
what
i
was
afraid
of
last
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
we're
happy
that
the
injunction
was
reinstated.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
that
is
correct.
we
would
gladly
do
it
again
if
we
would
have
to.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it's
one
of
those
cases
that
would
just
keep
evading
review.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
why
we
brought
it
in
federal
court.
i
don't
see
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
because
habeas
corpus,
which
we
thought
would
be
one
of
our
only
remedies,
which
we
talked
about
last
time,
did
not
appear
to
lie
in
this
type
of
case.
because
he
was
--
habeas
corpus
would
only
help
us
if
he
was
put
somewhere
illegally.
and
if
we
would
see
him
sitting
in
the
regional
center,
and
we
bring
the
habeas
corpus
and
we
have
the
writ,
it
would
be
dissolved.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
oh
--
if
the
question
is,
could
we
have
raised
this
in
state
court
as
opposed
to
bringing
it
in
a
three-judge
federal
court,
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
why
--
i
think
we
brought
it
in
the
three-judge
federal
panel.
i
think
we
saw
that
this
was
a
case
that
probably
was
going
to
probably
be
appealed.
and
it
would
have
taken
--
probably
five
years
already
going
through
the
federal
court
system,
and
it
probably
would
have
taken
seven
through
the
state
court
system.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
it
would
--
i
don't
know
if
we
could
have
or
we
couldn't
have,
your
honor.
but
it
would
have
been
my
opinion
that
we
couldn't
have.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
just
said
we
made
a
calculated
decision,
and
it
was
five
years
ago;
i
really
can't
remember
why;
to
bring
it
before
the
three-judge
federal
panel,
who--and
i--the
three-judge
federal
panel
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
type
of
case.
i
don'
t
think
there's
any
contention
there.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
would
depend
on
where
they're
placed.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
as
you
get
further
out
west,
there
are
a
lot
of
counties
who,
for
whatever
reason,
may
not
have
adequate
facilities
to
take
care
of
certain
types
of
prisoners.
many
times,
they'll
contract,
they'll
enter
into
contract
with
the
state
to
house
actual
prisoners
that
might
be
in
a
county
jail
at
the
nebraska
penal
correctional
complex.
so
then
they
are
clearly,
in
a
situation
like
that,
under
the
direction
of
the
department
of
corrections,
and
could
be
so
transferred
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
wish
i
knew.
and
i
really
don't.
and
there
is
nothing
in
any
opinion
or
order
of
the
court
which
really
gives
us
any
clue.
initially,
we
brought
this
case
just
up
on--before
the
three-judge
federal
panel
without
a
record.
we
were
trying
to
argue
the
merits,
and
we
wanted
a
temporary
injunction.
we
had
an
oral
hearing.
the
court
inquired
of
me
as
to
how
many
actual
people
were
involved
in
this
type
of
transfer,
and
i
said
that
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
there
were
probably
five
or
six
people
that
probably
were
under
a
threat
of
being
transferred
from
the
penal
complex
to
the
regional
center.
now,
the
court
had
previously
entered
the
order
making
it
a
class
action.
i--from
what
i
can
surmise,
i
think
based
on
what
i
told
them,
they
determined
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
--there
wasn't
enough
people.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
would
all
depend,
though,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
of
course,
it
depends
on
how
you
define
the
class.
now,
when
i
originally
got
the
three-judge
panel
to
call
it
a
class
action,
i
tried
to
define
the
class
as
all
those
people
that
were
confined
in
the
penal
complex
in
the
nebraska
state
reformatory,
which
was
about
1,300
people,
under
the
theory
that
these
people
are
all
under
a
threat
of
being
transferred.
and
maybe
when
the
three
judges
got
together,
they
just
didn't
like
my
definition
of
the
class.
and
they
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
understand
the
reasons
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
--going
to
concede
anything,
because
i
always
get
into
trouble
when
i
concede
things,
i
found
out,
particularly
in
this
court.
but
it
could
be
argued
that
1,300
people
are
under
the
threat
as
jones
is
of
now
being
transferred
just
by
the
mere
existence
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
maybe.
well,
that
would
certainly
be
a
tenuous
type
of
class.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
[laughter]
i'll
never
concede
anything
here
again.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
his
parole
is
set
for
1982.
and
it
does
not
appear
at
this
time
that
he
is
going
to
be
paroled
in
the
very
near
future.
i
just
wanted
to
mention
a
few
things
about
the
stigma
that
really
attaches
to
those
who
are
transferred
from
a
penal
complex
or
a
prison
to
a
state
hospital
as
happened
in
our
case.
even
if
a
prisoner
would
be
released,
and
let's
say
he
was
sent
over
for
evaluation
and
treatment
under
the
statute,
the
collateral
consequences
of
what
happens
to
him
really
stay
with
him
for
a
long
time.
and
that's
really
one
of
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
your
honor,
i
really
don't
concede
either--and
i'm
not
trying
to
be
smart
about
that--but
i
don't
concede
it,
because
i
don't
think
it's
on
the
record,
and
i
don't
think
the
state
really
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
did
set
himself
on
fire
and
tried
to
commit
suicide.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
think
there's
a
grave
difference,
though--there
may
be
a
fine
difference--between
the
types
of
collateral
consequences.
and
it
really
gets
into
this
stigma--or
call
it
whatever
you
want--and
i
think
it's
been
recognized
by
the
courts
that
it's
there--that
there's
a
difference
between
a
stigma
when
you
go
to
a
mental
institution.
it's
different.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
gist
of
psychiatric
medicine
right
now
is
trying
to
come
along
to
those
lines.
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
--
that
we've
really
come
that
far
today.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
don't--i
haven't
come
that
far.
i
suppose
in
some
cities
in
the
united
states
it
may
be
even
chic
to
have
a
psychiatrist,
or
to
be
having
--
to
having
psychiatric
problems.
it's
kind
of
a
thing
to
do
in
some
cities.
i
guess
in
nebraska,
which
is
basically
a
rural
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
think
if
this
court
would
feel
that
it
hasn't
gotten
close
to
that
ground,
it
perhaps
ought
to.
i
think
the
case--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
expectation
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
i'm
defending
that
opinion.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
because,
had
i
written
the
opinion,
i
felt
the
court
didn't
have
to
go
on
that
narrow
of
a
ground.
i
think
that
right,
that
liberty
interest,
is
so
fundamental
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
i
don't
teach
constitutional
law.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
that's
not
my
argument,
your
honor.
my
argument
is
that
i
don't
think
--
i
think
if
we
have
to
go
on
as
narrow
a
ground,
you
have
to
concede
that
this
is
a
meachum-type
case.
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
meachum-type
case.
i
think
clearly
it
does
not
fit
within
that
analytical
framework
at
all;
the
reason
being
that
they
talk
about
transfers
from
prison
to
prison,
this
was
clearly
a
transfer
from
a
prison
to
a
mental
hospital.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
that's
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
and
if
i
were
to
argue
in
support
of
that
base,
i
would
say
that
that
statute
gives
the
prisoner
an
expectation
rooted
in
state
law.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
i
was
going
to
get
to
it.
but
i
think
the
fundamental
--
the
argument
is
so
it's
so
fundamental.
i
think
he
ought
to
have
the
right
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
also
you
get
an
expectation
rooted
in
state
law
by
looking
to
nebraska
civil
commitment
statute
itself,
even
those
these
are
in
the
civil
context.
i
think
it's
clear
that
nebraska
does
have
commitment
procedure,
and
one
normally
would
not
have
the
expectation
that
he
would
end
up
in
a
mental
institution
without
a
hearing,
whether
or
not
he'd
be
walking
down
the
street
or
in
a
prison.
getting
back
to
the
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
was
the
question
about
chic
in
scott's
bluff?
i
--
it's
two
questions.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
right.
in
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
i
really
feel
that
because
nebraska
is
such
a
rural
state
--
my
wife
is
from
a
small
town
in
southeastern
nebraska.
and
i
know
that
if
someone
went
into
this
town
of
6,000,
everyone
knows
exactly
what
they're
doing.
and
it's
really
the
type
of
stigma
that
stays
with
you
in
a
small
town.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
clearly
not,
your
honor.
that
fundamental
right,
or
the
right
that
is
given
to
you
because
there's
an
expectation
given
to
you
by
state
law,
would
exist
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
stigma,
when
you
go
into
a
small
town,
might
be
more
felt
in
a
small
town
than
it
would
be
in
new
york
city.
because
in
a
town
of
5,000
people,
everyone
knows
you
came
from
the
nebraska
state
hospital.
and
it
would
affect
your
job
possibilities.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
think
in
mr.
jones
case,
the
plaintiff
here,
he
felt
that
it
had
--
he
didn't
want
to
be
there.
it
was
probably
much
more
of
a
stigma
to
him.
and
it
could
be
to
some
prisoners.
i'm
not
saying
that
might
not
be
a
stigma
to
everyone.
in
fact,
some
prisoners
may
in
fact
want
to
be
at
a
state
mental
hospital
as
opposed
to
the
penal
complex
for
certain
reasons,
for
security
or
for
whatever.
i
would
also
just
like
to
say
--
talk
a
moment
about
the
right
to
counsel
which
this
--
the
three
--
judge
court
found
should
exist,
if
in
fact
the
prisoner
is
given
some
type
of
hearing.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
we
do
find,
and
i
think
we
should
find,
that
the
prisoner
does
have
a
fundamental
right
to
a
hearing
before
he's
transferred
to
the
mental
hospital,
if
he
can't
afford
a
lawyer,
he
really
ought
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him.
it's
analogous
to
the
parens
patria
theory
that,
as
in
the
juvenile
proceedings,
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
take
this
person
under
their
wing
and
take
care
of
him
now
because
they
have
taken
away
some
of
his
liberties,
they
really
ought
to
take
care
of
him
and
insure
that
throughout
all
of
the
proceedings
that
he
is
afforded
counsel.
because
as
the
lower
court
found,
unless
the
prisoner
really
has
--
or
knows
his
rights,
what
good
are
the
rights?
they're
illusory.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
thank
you,
your
honor.
