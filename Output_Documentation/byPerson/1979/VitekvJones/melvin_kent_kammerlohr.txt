mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
this
case
was
here
and
extensively
argued
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
at
which
time
it
was
returned
back
to
a
three-judge
district
court
on
the
question
of
mootness,
because
the
--
mr.
jones
at
that
time
had
been
paroled
to
a
mental
--
va
mental
hospital
in
illinois.
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
his
parole
could
be
violated--revoked
at
any
time,
and
he
might
be
returned
back
to
the
penitentiary
at
nebraska,
where
he
would
be
subjected
to
the
same
possibility
of
being
transferred
to
a
state
mental
hospital.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
shortly
after
that,
about
three
months,
i
believe,
he
was
found
to
have
left--he
violated
it
some
way.
but
at
any
rate,
the
parole
board
violated
his
parole
and
put
out
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
and
he
was
subsequently
arrested
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
returned
to
the
penitentiary
in
nebraska,
where
he
now
is
incarcerated
in
the
regular
part
of
the
penitentiary,
as
of
this--as
of
monday.
so
they--we
still
have
the
same
basic
questions,
i
believe,
that
we
argued
here
before,
and
that's
really
whether
the
statute
in
nebraska
authorizing
transfer
is
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
because
the
three-judge
court,
your
honor,
enjoined
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
because
the
state
has
been
enjoined
from
transferring
him
to--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
i
wouldn't
object
to
that,
your
honor.
if
the
case
were
mooted,
and
we
were
no
longer
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
can't
say
that,
your
honor,
one
way
or
another.
i
--
if
he
should
--
as
you
know,
he
was
very
violent
before;
he
burned
himself
up.
and
if
he
should
do
something
like
that,
the
state
of
nebraska
would
transfer
him
immediately,
i'm
sure.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
but
we
don't
know
from
one
day
to
the
next.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
never
know,
and
i
am
sure
that
they
are
ready
to
transfer
him,
according
to
the
statute,
is
what
they
would
like
to
do,
at
any
time
if
he
should
suddenly
become
violent.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
except
that
we
aren't
subject
to
an
injunction
on
any
other
prisoner
except--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
might.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
it
would
depend
on,
i
support
on
his
conduct.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
on
his
conduct.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
and
this
gentleman
did
spend
five
months
in
a
civilian
hospital
in
lincoln
because
of
his
burns
before.
so,
they
do
this
everyday,
they
transfer
people
to
different
hospitals
for
medical
treatment.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
would
like
to
have
--
of
course
we
would
like
to
have
a
rule.
but
as
far
as
my
basic
legal
interests,
i
would
like
to
have
the
injunction
ended,
yes.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
are
--
we
only
have
three
district
judges
in
nebraska;
two
of
them
are
on
this
court.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
they
took
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
because
the
injunction
ran
for
as
long
as
he
was
subject
to
our
custody.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
was
still
in
the
three-judge--or
excuse
me,
he
was
still
in
the
illinois
hospital;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
except
that
he's
not
now
in
the
--
yes,
he's
back
where
he
was
before
it
ever
arose.
if
he
were
in
a
--
back
transferred
to
the
state
mental
hospital
we'd
be
exactly
where
we
were
when
he
brought
the
action.
i
think
the
officials
are
naturally
afraid
to
do
anything
because
of
the
injunction,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
two
of
the
three
judges
are
the
same
judges
they're
going
to
have
any
time
a
case
comes
up.
so
very
briefly,
then,
i
don't
want
to
go
over
all
of
the
ground
we've
gone
over
before.
i
appreciate
the
court's
time.
and
i
only
want
to
emphasize
a
couple
of
points.
and
that
is,
that
the
transfer,
according
to
statute,
is
not
just
for
treatment,
but
is
for
examination
and
study.
and
then
treatment,
if
necessary.
the
statute
provides
that
when
treatment
--
when
treatment
is
no
longer
necessary,
an
inmate
shall
be
transferred
back
to
the
penitentiary.
so
the
first
thing
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
it's
merely
a
question
of
sending
someone
over
to
a
private--or
to
a
mental
hospital,
the
same
as
civilians
go
to
for
examination
and
study.
the
second
thing
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
there
there's
no
issue
in
this
case
on
the
constitutional
quality
of
the
conditions
at
this
hospital.
this
has
never
been
raised
in
the
pleadings.
the
state
has
not
presented
any
evidence
on
whether
or
not
the
kind
of
treatment
is
adequate
or
not.
and
we
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
procedure
to
attack
this
place,
if
they
think
it's
bad,
on
the
constitutional
quality,
rather
than
on
the
method
of
getting
over
there.
and
these
are
points
which
we
went
into
quite
extensively
before,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
need
to
go
into
them
again,
your
honor.
so
with
that,
i'll
end.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
was
on
parole,
but
his
parole
was
a
limited
parole
to
danville.
and
at
the
time
the
three-judge
court--if
you
jibe
the
two
times
when
the
parole
violation
was
entered,
i
think
that
it
was
probably
about
the
time--the
three-judge
court
didn't
know
about
it.
it
was
not
before
the
three-judge
court
that
he
had
violated
it.
and
we
didn't
know
about
it
--
i
didn't
know
about
it
until
after
the
three-judge
decision
came
out.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
was
on
parole,
yes.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
as
far
as
the
three-judge
court
was
concerned.
i'm
sure
that's
true.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
but
they
just
thought
that
because
they'd
entered
this
injunction,
for
as
long
as
he
was
under
nebraska's
custody.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i'm
sure
he
could;
yes,
your
honor.
he
shouldn't
have
any
trouble
at
all.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
would
be
now.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
unless
we
have
some
new
rule.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we'll
be
fighting
this
thing
forever.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that's
right.
and
we
think
that
basically
this
gets
down
to,
has
the
legislature
of
nebraska,
the
legislative
body,
done
its
job
by
passing
a
proper
statute;
not
whether
the
administration
is
doing
anything
or
not
doing
anything.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
