burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
retail
store
employees
union.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
a
difference
--
mr.
come,
could
there
possibly
be
a
difference
between
the
branch
which
was
53%
owned
and
the
one
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
of
17%
owned?
oh
--
oh,
the
board
did
not
consider
that,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
did
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
did
it
address
itself
to
that
distinction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
title
company
could
--
safeco
could
control
the
five
or
six
retailers
as
it
were,
but
the
retailers
couldn't
control
safeco?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
mr.
gold,
the
language
that
the
customers
are
not
very
analytical
when
they
see
the
picket
sign
to
decide
whether
you're
picketing
particular
brand
of
oleomargarine
or
apples
or
whether
you're
--
they're
just
picketing
--
picketing
generally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
for
nearly
24
years,
almost
exactly
24
years,
i
have
heard
arguments
including
some
of
yours
mr.
gold
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
that
on
these
fine
shadings,
the
court
should
rely
on
the
board.
now,
the
board
has
engaged
in
all
that
process
here,
but
you're
telling
us
that
the
boards
--
i
don't
think
the
word,
“expertise”
appears
in
your
brief
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
think
it
would,
you
know.
what's
happened
at
the
board's
expertise
in
this
--
in
this
very
subtle
and
sophisticated
area
that
we've
been
told
for
so
long,
should
be
the
problems
of
the
board
and
not
the
judges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
i
hear
you
earlier
that
suggest
that
--
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
that
the
boards
construction
was
consistent
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
when
you're
dealing
with
the
catholic
bishop's
case
for
example,
you're
dealing
with
what
is
or
was
--
not
is
or
is
not
in
the
statute.
not
with
the
nuances
and
shadings
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
