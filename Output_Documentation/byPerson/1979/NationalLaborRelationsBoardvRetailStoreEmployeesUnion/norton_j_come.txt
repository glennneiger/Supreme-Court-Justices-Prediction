mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
here
--
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
sitting
en
banc
and
dividing
5-to-4,
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
against
the
union,
local
of
the
retail
clerks
international,
which
the
board
found
had
engaged
in
secondary
picketing
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
section
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
threat
and
coerce
or
restrain
any
person
for
an
object
of
forcing
him
to
cease
dealing
in
the
products
of
or
otherwise,
to
cease
dealing
of
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
a
proviso
to
this
section
accepts
publicity
other
than
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public
that
a
product
or
products
are
produced
by
an
employer
of
whom
the
union
has
a
primary
dispute
and
are
distributed
by
another
employer.
the
question
whether
the
picketing
here
violates
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
(b)
turns
on
an
application
of
the
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
tree
fruits
decision
in
1964.
the
relevant
facts
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
except
that
in
tree
fruits,
as
i
will
indicate,
the
court
did
interpret
that
language
as
applied
to
picketing
of
this
general
character.
but
at
bottom,
we
do
get
back
to
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
that
was
what
tree
fruits
attempted
to
do.
the
union
here
is
the
certified
bargaining
representative
of
certain
employees
of
safeco
title
insurance
company.
and
it
called
a
strike
following
an
impasse
in
negotiations
over
an
initial
contract.
in
addition
to
picketing
safeco's
office,
striking
employees
also
engaged
in
picketing
of
five
land
title
companies
that
sell
only
safeco
title
insurance
policies.
the
signs
carried
by
the
picket
stated
that
safeco
was
non-union
and
did
not
have
a
contract
with
the
union
and
the
handbills,
which
were
distributed
at
the
general
public,
requested
that
numbers
of
the
public
boycott
safeco
insurance.
the
union's
activities
at
the
land
title
companies
did
not
cause
any
work
stoppages
or
interference
with
deliveries.
from
90%
to
95%
of
the
income
of
the
land
title
companies
is
derived
from
the
issuance
of
safeco
title
insurance
policies.
the
remaining
5%
to
10%
comes
from
title
research
and
escrow
services.
each
land
title
company
operates
under
an
agency
contract
with
safeco
under
which
safeco
operate
--
underwrites
all
of
its
title
insurance.
and
the
land
title
company
agrees
not
to
act
as
an
agent
for
any
other
title
insurance
company.
safeco
owns
stock
in
all
of
the
land
title
companies,
53%
in
one
and
amounts
ranging
from
18%
to
38%
in
the
other
four.
the
remaining
stock
is
held
by
various
individuals.
an
officer
of
safeco
serves
as
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
--
of
each
land
title
company
and
two
served
on
the
board
of
the
company
in
which
safeco
owns
53%
of
the
stock.
however,
each
land
title
company
independently
establishes
its
own
wages
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
its
own
employees.
and
there
is
no
interchange
of
employees
between
the
land
title
companies
and
safeco.
based
upon
these
facts,
the
board
concluded
that
despite
the
land
title
company's
economic
dependents
on
--
on
safeco
for
the
underwriting
of
the
title
insurance,
each
land
title
company
retained
control
over
their
own
labor
relations
policies
and
their
day
to
day
operations
and
therefore,
they
were
independent
companies
and
not
allied
or
part
of
safeco.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
this
finding
and
the
union
does
not
challenge
it
here.
so,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
land
title
companies
are
neutral
employers
for
purposes
of
second
--
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
statute.
the
board
then
considered
the
application
of
tree
fruits,
whether
this
court
ruled
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
(b)
permits
an
--
union
to
engage
in
consumer
picketing
at
the
site
of
a
secondary
employer
directed
only
at
the
struck
product.
without
laws,
a
union
appeal
with
a
secondary
site
which
has
the
effect
of
causing
consumers
not
to
trade
at
all
with
the
secondary
employer.
and
the
board,
the
two
numbers
dissenting,
concluded
that
although
the
union's
secondary
site
picketing
was
limited
to
safeco's
products,
the
picketing
violated
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
(b)
because
it
was
reasonably
calculated
to
induce
customers
not
to
patronize
neutral
title
companies
at
all.
because
since
virtually
all
of
their
business
consisted
of
safeco
title
insurance,
the
picketing
of
successful,
would
necessarily
result
in
a
total
boycott
of
the
title
companies'
business.
because
of
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
which
i
eluded
to
earlier,
the
union's
hand
billing
was
--
of
the
title
companies
was
neither
alleged
nor
found
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
only
thing
that
was
interdicted
was
the
picket
line
in
front
of
the
title
companies.
now,
we
submit
that
the
board's
application
of
tree
fruits
is
a
reasonable
application
of
that
--
of
the
principles
articulated
in
--
in
that
decision.
the
union
in
tree
fruits
as
the
court
will
recall,
picketed
neutral
safeway
stores
to
persuade
safeway's
customers
to
boycott
washington
state
apples
in
support
of
a
dispute
that
the
union
had
with
the
packers
and
distributors
of
those
apples.
rejecting
the
board's
ruling
that
all
such
secondary
picketing
was
violative
of
the
statute,
the
court
determined
that
enacting
--
and
in
enacting
section
8
(b)
(4)
(bb)
--
(ii)
(b),
the
court
had
meant
to
outlaw
a
peaceful
consumer
picketing
employed
to
persuade
the
customers
of
the
secondary
employer
and
quoting
from
the
court,
“to
cease
trading
with
them
in
order
to
force
them
to
put
pressure
upon
the
primary
employer.”
but
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
outlaw
picketing
which
as
in
this
case
before
it,
only
persuades
the
neutral's
customers
not
to
buy
the
struck
product.
the
court
explained
that
when
consumer
picketing
is
employed
only
to
persuade,
customer
is
not
to
buy
the
struck
product,
the
union's
appeal
is
closely
confined
to
the
primary
dispute.
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
consumer
of
picketing
is
employed
to
persuade,
customer
is
not
to
trade
at
all,
but
the
secondary
employer.
the
union
does
more
than
merely
follow
the
struck
product.
it
creates
a
separate
dispute
with
the
secondary
employer.
now,
the
fact
of
tree
fruits,
permitted
a
clear
distinction
between
picketing
limited
to
persuading
customer
is
not
to
buy
this
struck
product
and
picketing
aimed
at
the
secondary's
patronage
generally,
because
apples
occupied,
but
a
small
portion
of
safeway's
retail
shelves
and
the
union
could
urge
safeway's
customers
from
refrain
from
buying
the
apples
without
asking
that
they
cease
trading
with
safeway
altogether.
here,
such
a
sharp
distinction
cannot
be
made,
because
although
the
picketing
is
directed
at
the
struck
product,
that
product
constitutes
virtually
all
of
the
neutral's
business.
and
in
these
circumstances,
the
picketing
necessarily
is
successful
with
result
in
a
boycott
of
the
neutral's
total
business.
and
in
that
kind
of
situation,
one
interest
must
yield.
either
the
union's
interest
in
maximizing
pressure
on
the
primary,
or
the
neutral's
interest
in
avoiding
a
boycott
of
its
total
business,
and
we
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1959
amendments
of
the
act,
which
has
set
forth
at
length
in
the
various
opinions
and
in
--
in
tree
fruits,
this
history
which
shows
a
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
protect
neutral
employers
from
secondary
picketing
at
least,
where
it
called
for
a
boycott
of
the
neutral's
total
business,
the
board
was
not
unreasonable
in
striking
the
balance
here
in
favor
of
the
neutral
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
on
the
finding
of
the
board
that
was
sustained
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
it
--
under
the
established
principles
that
are
applied
with
respect
to
determining
neutrality,
you'll
look
at
a
--
a
number
of
factors,
the
degree
of
common
ownership
and
control,
the
degree
of
economic
interdependence
and
also,
the
degree
of
control
over
labor
relations
in
the
day
to
day
operations
of
the
--
of
the
entity.
the
board
found
that
looking
at
a
--
all
of
these
factors,
they
predominated
the
--
in
favor
of
the
finding
of
--
of
neutrality,
because
although
there
was
some
common
ownership
and
some
representation
of
sharing
of
directors,
in
terms
of
the
actual
control
over
the
labor
relations,
safeco
had
no
control
over
that.
and
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
did
consider
that
one
as
well
as
the
other
as
in
found
that
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
it
found
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
found
that
despite
the
--
the
fact
that
there
was
more
ownership
in
that
case,
there
was
still
no
showing
that
there
was
any
--
that
that
additional
amount
of
stock
ownership
had
resulted
in
any
greater
interference
or
control
by
safeco
over
the
labor
relations
policies
of
the
land
title
companies.
and
therefore,
in
terms
of
the
finding
of
neutrality,
there
was
no
difference.
because
the
essence
of
what
makes
a
neutral
for
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
purposes,
is
whether
or
not,
the
neutral
is
powerless
to
resolve
the
underlying
dispute
with
the
primary
other
than
by
ceasing
to
do
business
with
the
primary.
and
the
board
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
its
finding,
that
that
was
the
situation
of
the
land
title
companies
here
even
the
one
with
the
53%
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
our
second
point
is
that
if
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
applying
to
--
as
interdicting
this
type,
picketing
is
upheld,
we
do
not
believe
that
as
the
union
urges,
that
a
substantial
constitutional
problem
is
presented.
the
union
has
devoted
a
substantial
portion
of
its
brief
to
this
contention,
but
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
phase
of
this
case
was
settled
by
this
court
many
years
ago
in
hughes
against
superior
court.
and
in
which
principles
have
been
followed
as
recently
as
several
months
ago
in
babbitt
against
farmers
workers.
the
nub
of
the
point
is
that
it's
--
as
we
read
the
cases,
it
is
settled
law
that
picketing
is
a
mode
of
communication
that
is
inseparably
--
that
while
picketing
is
a
mode
of
communication,
it's
inseparably
something
more
indifferent.
it's
more
than
free
speech,
since
it
involves
patrol
of
a
particular
locality
and
since
the
very
presence
of
a
picket
line,
may
induce
action
of
one
kind
or
another
quite
different
from
the
nature
of
the
ideas
which
are
being
disseminated.
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
it
--
it
does
--
thornhill
of
course,
held
that
a
point
had
been,
on
all
picketing,
would
be
unconstitutional
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
first
--
first,
certainly,
since
wohl,
which
came
on
a
year
or
two
after
thornhill
and
ritter's
café
which
followed
wohl
and
then
we
move
to
the
--
this
was
in
the
early
1940s
and
then
we
moved
up
to
the
early
1950s
with
--
with
hughes
and
gazzam
and
--
and
henke.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
giboney
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
that
is
the
ice
company.
now
it's
argued
here
that
giboney
is
distinguishable
because
in
giboney,
the
picketing
sought
an
action
which
was
itself
made
unlawful
under
a
state
law,
namely,
it
was
in
support
of
an
objective
that
would
violate
the
state
antitrust
laws.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it's
argued
here
that
the
objective
sought
by
this
picketing
is
not
unlawful
in
that
sense
because
there
is
nothing
unlawful
for
a
consumer
to
boycott
a
--
a
title
company
or
a
retail
store
for
reasons
of
his
own,
nor
by
virtue
of
the
publicity
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
would've
be
unlawful
for
a
union
by
publicity,
other
than
picketing
to
seek
to
induce
such
a
boycott.
we
submit
however
though,
that
hughes
shows
that
you
don't
have
to
have
an
objective
that
is
unlawful
in
that
sense
for
a
state
or
the
federal
government
to
restrict
its
attainment
by
a
form
of
coercion
such
as
is
represented
by
secondary
picketing.
in
the
langer
case,
the
court
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
ban
on
picketing
that
(i)
(b)
imposed
against
peaceful
picketing
that
induced
employees,
secondary
employees
to
strike
in
furtherance
of
a
secondary
boycott
objective.
the
court
held
that
congress
in
furtherance
of
its
legitimate
objective
of
avoiding
interferences
to
interstate
commerce
which
are
caused
by
bringing
coercive
pressures
on
neutrals
and
labor
disputes
that
they
are
powerless
to
--
to
resolve,
could
restrict
that
form
of
secondary
picketing
and
furtherance
of
that
legitimate
governmental
objective.
similarly,
we
submit
that
congress
could
likewise
proscribe
secondary
consumer
picketing
at
least.
whereas
here,
it
calls
for
a
total
boycott
of
the
neutral's
business
in
furtherance
of
its
objective
of
freeing
neutrals
from
these
pressures
and
indeed,
in
the
farm
workers
against
babbitt
case,
in
which
this
court
--
to
be
sure
was
interpreting
or
was
considering
a
state
statute,
the
arizona
farm
labor
statute
and
they
had
a
publicity
proviso
there
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
unconstitutional?
the
court
in
setting
aside
the
lower
court's
holding
of
unconstitutionality
indicated
that
publicity
stood
on
a
different
footing
than
picketing.
that
hughes
had
recognized
that
picketing
was
more
than
publicity
and
that
--
that
it
would
certainly
be
constitutional
to
prescribe
picketing
that
would
cut
off
the
entire
business
of
a
neutral
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
do.
the
board
has
lived
with
tree
fruits
for
16
years.
it
feels
that
it
can
continue
to
live
with
it,
but
it
feels
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
situation
in
tree
fruits
and
is
asking
for
affirmance
on
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
decision,
i
--
it
would
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
any
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
to
whether
the
dissent
accurately
interpreted
the
majority
opinion
of
course
is
--
is
the
question
that
we
have
now.
judge
friendly
once
put
it,
“dissents
often
are
more
accurately
reflect
cassandra's
gloom
than
her
--
than
her
accuracy.”
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
--
but
the
board
--
since
after
--
after
tree
fruits
was
not
faced
with
a
--
a
single
product
situation,
the
way
the
progression
developed
was
the
first
cases
that
we
got
--
the
board
got
involved
of
so-called,
merge
product
situations.
where
for
example,
you
had
a
dispute
with
a
bread
company
and
you'd
picket
a
restaurant
and
asked
the
patrons
not
to
use
the
bread
when
they
went
to
the
restaurant.
and
the
--
the
board
held
and
the
courts
uniformly
agreed
that
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you
couldn't
separate
out
the
struck
product
and
therefore,
you
necessarily
were
calling
for
a
total
boycott
of
the
business.
and
the
court
below
accepted
the
--
the
merged
product
distinction
in
an
earlier
case,
honolulu
typographical
union,
but
it
bought
that
carrying
what
we
feel
was
the
logical
progression
of
the
merged
product
cases
to
a
situation
such
as
we
here
where
the
struck
product
constitutes
the
neutral's
entire
business.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
wanted
to
make
one
point
and
that
is
that
the
distinction
between
signal
picketing
and
publicity
picketing
was
rejected
by
the
court
in
--
in
hughes.
there,
justice
frankfurter
speaking
for
the
court
and
talking
about
publicity
picketing
said
that
it
no
less
than
signal
picketing
was
speech
plus
and
it
was
because
of
the
plus
aspects
that
it
could
be
regulated
by
the
legislature
in
furtherance
of
a
legitimate
narrow
objective
and
certainly
eliminating
coercion
on
neutrals
in
labor
disputes
is
an
objective
within
the
prerogatives
of
congress
as
this
court
has
recognized.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
