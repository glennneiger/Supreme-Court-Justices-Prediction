mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
point
of
agreement
between
the
board
and
ourselves
is
that
this
case
raises
an
issue
which
is
a
variation
on
that
considered
in
the
tree
fruits
case.
and
that
in
deciding
tree
fruits,
the
court
construed
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
(b)
and
stated
its
construction
and
the
meaning
of
that
statutory
provision
at
377
u.s.
72.
we
have
--
mr.
laurence
gold
if
--
yes,
i
do
have
a
doubt
of
that
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
--
in
tree
fruits.
the
literal
language
says
that
you
can't
restrain
and
coerce.
tree
fruits
tells
us
that
at
least
some
picketing
designed
to
get
consumers
not
to
purchase
a
--
a
struck
good
is
not
restraint
in
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
those
words.
those
words
don't
have
one
meaning
and
the
court
accorded
them
the
meaning
that
it
believed
was
fairest
and
the
most
rational
given
--
mr.
laurence
gold
obviously,
the
argument
was
made
and
accepted
as
an
initial
proposition.
it
has
to
be
an
initial
proposition
at
some
state.
after
the
statute
was
passed,
the
argument
was
made
and
eventually,
it
was
accepted
that
those
words
don't
include
a
product
--
struck
product
picketing.
obviously,
i
believe
that
that
construction
is
both
rational
and
possible.
i'm
confirmed
on
that
as
i
stand
here
by
the
fact
that
a
majority
agreed
with
it,
but
before
that
was
true,
the
argument
had
to
be
made
based
on
the
language,
the
general
meaning
of
those
words,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
overall
approach
towards
construing
the
statute
and
that
was
done.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
the
words
restrain
and
coerced
are
not
self-defining
words
and
that
if
we
had
no
legislative
history,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
it's
possible
to
include
peaceful
picketing
by
a
single
person
asking
a
consumer
not
to
buy
a
product.
but
if
i
were
charged
with
interpreting
the
statute,
i
would
not
so
construe
it.
and
as
i
say,
the
court
did
not
so
construe.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
sir.
we
understand
the
statement
of
the
rule
in
the
case
to
be
that
the
--
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
was
intended
to
cover
picketing,
persuading
customers
of
the
secondary
employer
to
cease
all
trading
with
him.
that
is
the
statement
of
the
rule
--
mr.
laurence
gold
--
in
the
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
--
that
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
i
understand.
in
other
words
--
and
this
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
get
to
and
i
believe
it's
responsive
to
the
question
you're
asking
now.
both
--
in
our
brief
and
in
the
board's
brief,
we
set
out
in
full
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
and
17
are
the
ultimate
rationale
of
the
court
from
377
u.s.72.
we
start
at
the
same
place,
we
end
at
the
same
place
and
there
no
elisions
in
either
brief.
what
that
passage
says
we
believe,
is
not
simply
that
picketing
aimed
at
the
secondary's
patronage
generally
is
unlawful,
but
it
also
explains
why
it's
unlawful.
and
thereby
provides
a
basis
for
deciding
future
cases.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
can
imagine
a
path
of
a
decision,
very
much
like
the
common
law
which
would
distinguish
between
what
was
called,
“fair
persuasion
limited
to
the
goods.”
and
going
beyond
that,
now,
i've
--
for
the
reasons,
i'll
express,
we
will
suggest
that
such
a
line
is
unsound
on
a
constitutional
--
mr.
laurence
gold
--
basis.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
there
are
several
justifications.
first
of
all,
in
giboney,
the
union
was
seeking
two
unlawful
objects.
it
was
a
crime
under
the
law
of
--
of
the
state
under
the
law
of
missouri
for
the
picketed
employer
to
refuse
to
deal,
to
--
to
join
a
concerted
boycott.
in
addition,
it
was
a
crime
for
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
refusals
to
work.
but
there
is
just
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
always
true.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tail
wags
the
dog
if
you
don't
begin
that
way.
if
the
conduct
isn't
unlawful
to
ask
for
conduct,
would
seem
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
else,
it's
difficult
to
understand
what
the
first
amendment
is
about.
on
the
other
hand,
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
me
if
i
threaten
to
punch
somebody
in
the
nose
or
invite
somebody
to
engage
in
the
crime
of
murder.
and
that's
been
understood
ever
since
fox
versus
washington,
is
a
class
of
verbal
acts
which
are
unlawful,
but
it
is
a
very
strange
first
amendment,
i
would
suggest
to
you.
that
bars
a
--
a
request
to
a
member
of
the
general
public
to
do
something
which
under
state
law,
he
has
every
right
to
do.
and
indeed,
as
i
intent
to
argue,
under
virginia
pharmacy
board
and
cases
like
glenmark,
the
first
amendment
has
been
recognized
to
protect
the
right
of
individuals
to
truthfully
state
a
fact
which
is
relevant
to
a
buying
decision.
price
or
the
fact
that
it
was
made
on
the
struck
conditions,
at
least
so
long
as
the
recipient
of
that
message,
the
consumer
is
free
to
take
it
into
account
or
not
and
we
don't
understand
how
it
could
be
otherwise.
and
we
don't
understand
how
that
can
be
a
rational
distinction
in
terms
of
the
right
of
unions
to
state
such
a
message
and
the
right
of
pharmacists
to
state
the
price
at
which
they
sell
goods.
mr.
laurence
gold
well
--
mr.
laurence
gold
if
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
well,
if
--
if
they
have
a
right
not
to
work,
i
would
be
up
here
making
precisely
the
same
argument.
if
they
had
the
right
to
engage
in
a
concerted
refusal
to
work,
but
i
understand
that
congress
and
the
states
have
the
right
to
regulate
concerted
refusals
to
work.
that's
been
understood
for
a
very
long
time.
that's
certainly
regulating
conduct
and
i
would
not
argue
otherwise.
and
if
that
conduct
is
regulated
and
within
the
limits
of
the
imminent
danger
test
of
brandenburg,
if
you
--
inviting
those
employees
to
engage
in
an
illegal
act
or
as
the
cases
all
have
been
in
effect
ordering
them
to
do
so
at
the
pain
of
union
discipline
is
--
can
be
made
unlawful
compatible
with
the
first
amendment
just
the
way
conspiracy
can,
invitations
to
engage
in
a
murder
or
any
other
unlawful
activities.
so,
to
that
extent,
we
don't
believe
that
unions
or
anyone
else
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
what
we
find
and
which
--
what
we
suggest
to
be
the
novel
and
important
issue
here
is
whether
a
communication
to
members
of
the
general
public
under
--
at
least
under
non-coercive
circumstances
can
be
interdicted
even
though
the
request
made
contains
truthful
information
and
asked
for
an
entirely
lawful
response.
we
don't
understand
how
it
can
be
and
we
would
suggest
that
there
has
not
yet
been
a
case
in
this
court
which
says
that
it
can
be
or
that
it
should
be.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
were
all
on
public
thoroughfares
which
ever
since
hague
versus
cio
has
been
recognized
as
a
public
forum
in
business
areas
where
the
problems
of
privacy
and
so
on
which
you
were
discussing
in
this
morning's
case
are
--
are
not
present.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
but
--
mr.
laurence
gold
--
the
streets,
the
parks
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
to
return
if
i
could
to
the
--
the
statutory
argument
which
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out
is
far
narrower
than
the
constitutional
argument
that
we
make.
the
court
at
377
u.s.
72
which
is
i
have
noted
was
--
it's
set
out
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
not
only
stated
that
picketing
carried
out
at
the
--
picketing
aimed
at
the
secondary's
patronage
generally,
is
unlawful,
but
also,
stated
what
it
meant
by
that
term.
the
board
approach
in
this
case
assumes
that
that
phrase
was
uttered
and
that
the
court
did
not
explain
it
all
what
it
meant.
we
think
that
that's
an
unfair
reading
of
the
opinion.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
opinion
says
in
its
own
words
is,
“on
the
other
hand,
when
consumer
picketing
is
employed
to
persuade
customers
not
to
trade
at
all
with
the
secondary
employer,
the
latter
stops
buying
the
struck
product
not
because
of
the
falling
demand,
but
in
response
to
pressure
designed
to
inflict
injury
on
his
business
generally.”
in
other
words,
if
the
union
goes
beyond
the
product
and
asks
people
not
to
buy
other
products
sold
by
that
employer,
it
is
why
deemed
the
dispute.
and
in
that
sense,
it
has
acted
improperly
for
statutory
purposes.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
i
believe
on
the
next
page,
the
court
dealt
with
that
and
said
that
be
that
as
it
may,
if
the
union
is
meeting
its
obligation
namely,
to
fairly
advise
the
public
what
its
dispute
is
that
it
is
within
the
statute.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
situation
is
not
different
from
the
line
drawn
in
so-called
common
side
of
situations
where
union
does
or
does
not
violate
the
law
depending
on
whether
it
fairly
advises
the
limits
of
the
dispute
and
who
would
the
dispute
is
--
is
with.
i
think
the
theory
of
the
opinion
is
that
the
wrong
--
is
if
the
union
extends
the
dispute
not
of
people
choose
to
ignore
what
the
sign
says
and
go
beyond
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
it
won't
cross
my
lips
today.
mr.
laurence
gold
there
--
i
--
i
would
argue
that
what
has
happened
is
tree
fruits.
it
--
as
i
understand
the
--
the
nature
of
judicial
review
at
the
initial
stage,
the
court
gives
deference
to
the
agency's
expertise.
but
that
process
has
not
allowed
i
think,
the
term
is
to
slip
into
inertia.
and
once
the
court
has
acted,
the
agency's
obligation
is
to
fairly
read
the
opinion,
our
whole
first
point.
mr.
laurence
gold
no
more
or
less
than
it
was
in
tree
fruits.
mr.
laurence
gold
but
certainly,
whether
it
is
your
opinion
in
catholic
archbishop
of
chicago
or
the
more
recent
opinion
in
the
yeshiva
case,
the
board's
expertise
as
obviously
never
given
complete
sway.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
but
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
and
in
yeshiva,
we
were
dealing
with
the
nuances
of
--
of
a
term,
managerial
employees.
it
doesn't
even
appear
in
the
statute
and
the
brunt
of
the
opinion
as
i
understand
it
was
that
the
court
having
treated
with
that
issue.
in
--
in
prior
cases,
the
board
had
an
obligation
to
follow
with
deference
and
with
respect
--
what
the
court
has
said.
we
believe
quite
clearly
that
the
board
hasn't
fulfilled
that
most
central
function
to
an
orderly
system
of
--
of
federal
statutory
interpretation
and
elaboration.
as
i
say,
my
first
reason,
our
first
reason
for
that
is
the
fact
that
the
board
has
given
no
reference
to
the
context
in
which
the
critical
phrases
were
used
in
the
opinion
and
has
ignored
absolutely
the
example
we
set
out
from
the
court's
opinion
in
--
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
which
we
think
makes
its
intent
absolutely
lucid.
in
addition,
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
portion
of
the
case
that
the
board
has
indeed
adopted
the
very
theory
of
the
tree
fruits,
court
of
appeals
rejected
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
said
that
the
board
was
wrong,
but
said
also
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
determine
economic
impact,
possible
economic
impact
on
safeway.
the
heart
of
the
board's
theory
here
in
its
leading
case
is
that
tree
fruits
rest
on
the
minimal
impact
of
the
picketing
on
safeway
as
compared
to
the
predictable
economic
effect
of
the
picketing
here
which
would
cause
the
agencies
to
abandon
the
primary,
in
favor
of
a
new
source
of
supply.
that
is
precisely
the
test
we
would
suggest,
that
was
rejected
in
tree
fruits.
i
would
--
i
have
10
minutes
left.
i
would
like
to
discuss
both
of
the
constitutional
arguments
that
we
make.
interestingly
enough,
justice
black
concurred
in
tree
fruits
on
the
ground
not
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
that
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
opinion
as
set
out
at
page
33
of
our
brief,
“while
others
are
left
free
to
picket
for
other
reasons,
those
who
wished
to
picket
to
inform
safeway
customers
of
their
labor
dispute
with
the
primary
employer
are
barred
from
picketing,
solely
on
the
ground
of
the
lawful
information
they
want
to
impart
to
the
customers.”
the
--
the
court
of
course
eventually
in
mosley
and
then
erznoznik
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
city
of
madison
has
adopted
justice
black's
view
of
the
special
consideration
that
has
to
be
given
to
an
antidiscrimination
principle
in
the
first
amendment
area.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
i
would
consider
it
would
be
a
different
case.
in
other
words,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
in
regulating
signals
to
organized
employees
not
to
engage
--
excuse
me,
signals
to
organized
employees
to
engage
in
a
concerted
work
stoppage
need
adopt
an
intent
as
opposed
to
an
effects
test.
but,
we
do
argue
that
labor
unions
or
any
other
organization
in
this
society
unions
have
one
out
of
every
four
working
people
in
their
ranks.
there
are
many
who
aren't
even
organizable,
who
have
no
control
over
the
individuals
they're
appealing
to,
can
carry
a
placard
which
is
the
essence
of
picketing,
asking
members
of
the
general
public
to
do
something
they
have
a
right
to
do.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
i
would
argue
that
their
constitutionality
would
turn,
(a)
on
whether
the
conduct
that
they
stimulated
has
been
regulated
and
banned.
and
(2),
on
whether
the
message
can
be
fairly
whereas
addressed
to
create
a
consumer
--
i
mean,
to
create
a
concerted
work
stoppage.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
--
we
will
never
be
here
arguing
that
it
is
so
unfair
to
read
it,
if
we
won
this
case.
that
it's
so
unfair
to
read
our
sign
as
directed
to
employees
that
we
went
up
and
we
pleaded
with
them.
let's
take
that
case.
suppose
there's
a
case
where
the
union
officials
go
up
and
plead
and
the
district
judge
finds
in
good
faith
with
the
employees
not
to
engage
in
a
concerted
work
stoppage.
and
nonetheless,
the
picketing
is
enjoined
on
a
pure
effect
test.
i
think
that's
a
difficult
constitutional
case
if
it's
--
if
that
effect
is
used
to
ban
all
communication
to
everybody
in
the
area
of
both
--
on
many
steps
from
having
a
luxury
of
arguing
that
case
to
you
or
mr.
come
argues
that
we
can't
even
appeal
to
consumers,
if
we
don't
cause
a
single
illegal
consequence.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
--
i
don't
read
his
--
his
article
to
--
to
get
to
that
point.
his
--
he
--
that
portion
of
his
article
is
arguing
against
equating,
picketing
for
--
picketing
address
to
consumers
was
so-called
signal
picketing
addressed
to
--
to
workers.
in
other
portions
of
his
article,
he
questions
cases
like
henke
and
gazzam
and
so
on
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
which
seem
to
relax
the
giboney
standard
and
which
suggest
that
picketing
can
be
banned
even
though
it
causes
no
unlawful
end.
but
only
an
end
in
a
very
strange
sense
which
is
against
public
policy
even
though
the
public
policy
doesn't
ban
the
conduct
which
takes
place.
that
would
be
like
saying
that
you
can
ban
leafleting,
asking
people
to
do
something
lawful
because
you
disagree
with
the
ultimate
social
utility
of
the
message.
we
think
that's
an
entirely
wrong
and
terribly
dangerous
idea.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
hughes
case
--
can
be
read
as
being
close
to
that.
it
may
be
a
case
in
which
there
was
an
unlawful
ultimate
object
though
you
can
read
the
california
cases
differently.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that's
right.
and
at
that
point,
the
supposition
was
that
california
could
ban
affirmative
action
and
the
california
opinions
can
be
read
as
either
banning
it
or
not.
justice
frankfurter
says
two
different
things
in
two
different
passages.
we
do
believe
for
five
separate
reasons
that
hughes
has
been
passed
by,
that
its
analysis
is
unsound.
we
think
first
of
all
that
without
acknowledging
it,
it
expands
giboney
to
change
the
requirement
from
an
unlawful
object
to
one
which
is
against
public
policy
in
this
very
unusual
use
of
that
term.
that
secondly,
hughes
rest
on
a
proposition
that
speech
which
is
not
an
appeal
to
reason
can
be
banned
of
a
view
which
is
absolutely
incompatible,
we
would
suggest,
with
cases
such
as
cone
and
spence
versus
washington.
next,
hughes
rest
on
the
premise
which
we
think
is
absolutely
contrary
to
the
test
stated
in
united
states
versus
o'brien
that
picketing
can
be
banned
because
it
involves
conduct
and
without
regard
to
whether
the
ban
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prevent
wrongful
conduct
and
doesn't
cut
into
express
of
speech
anymore
than
is
necessary.
and
i
want
to
say
something
at
this
point
about
the
meaning
of
picketing
and
the
meaning
of
compulsion.
mr.
justice
marshall
in
its
opinion
in
--
in
the
mosley
case
noted
that
picketing
can
be
an
act
by
a
single
person
walking
back
and
forth
with
a
placard.
now,
there
can
be
statements
and
opinions
and
statements
by
the
board
that
that
is
inherently
compulsive
in
the
sense
that
it
would
frighten
away
somebody
from
crossing.
but
we
don't
think
that
there
is
an
iota
of
reality
to
that.
that
is
no
more
threatening
than
going
up
to
someone
and
asking
him
if
they'll
sign
a
petition.
it's
no
more
threatening
than
going
up
and
asking
him
if
he
will
take
a
leaflet.
we
ask
you
to
look
at
the
record
in
number
88,
1964
term,
“tree
fruits”
at
the
two
rather
dignified
ladies
picketing
in
tree
fruits
and
we
ask
you
if
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
were
engaged
in
compulsive
activity.
