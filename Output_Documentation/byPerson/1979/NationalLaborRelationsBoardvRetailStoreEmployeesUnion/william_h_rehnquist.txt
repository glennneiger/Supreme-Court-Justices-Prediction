justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
--
it
turns
basically
on
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
and
naturally,
any
cases
from
this
court
interpreting
the
statute
but
that
the
basic
criteria
is
the
statutory
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
thornhill
against
alabama
that
picketing
is
free
speech
plus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
also
recognized
that
picketing
wasn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
on
the
--
on
the
record
before
us,
the
union
in
this
case
violated
the
literal
language
of
the
prohibition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
--
what
if
tree
fruits
had
never
been
decided?
would
you
still
--
would
you
still
say
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
room
for
argument
that
the
union
did
not
violate
this
statute
as
written?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but,
what
i
was
asking
was
the
enacted
will
of
congress
as
holmes
put
it
at
one
time,
the
language
that
congress
actually
enacted
apart
from
legislative
history
or
anything
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
--
how
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
can
you
justify
your
answer
to
--
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
in
light
of
giboney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
just
makes
the
tail
follow
the
dog
and
i
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
believe
the
--
the
state
in
effect,
had
--
decides
what
is
protected
and
what
isn't
protected
on
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
were
--
where
were
this
picket
stationed?
were
they
all
on
--
on
some
sort
of
public
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
not
all
public
thorough
--
public
property
is
a
public
forum.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
you
say
here
--
here
all
--
all
the
pickets
were
stationed
at
places
which
were
would
be
public
forum
under
our
cases?
