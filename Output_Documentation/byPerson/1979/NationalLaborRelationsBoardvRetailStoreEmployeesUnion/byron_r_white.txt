what
about
the
--
the
question
i
asked
mr.

is
there

is
there
any
question
that
--
that
if
in

the
picketing
had
been
directed
at

saying

saying

yes,
but
--
justice

--
your
--
if
--
you
picket
--
you
picket
safeway,
you're
asking
consumers,
don't
deal
with
safeway.
and
--
and
then
you
say,
because
you
asked
the
consumers
generally,
don't
they
deal
with
safeway,
you'll
say
that's
enough
of
the
pressure
on
safeway
not
to
deal
with

is
that
it?
justice

are
you
saying
that
and
would
you
say
that
that
kind
of
an
application
of
the

if
it
--
that
i
just
proposed
would
be
constitutional?
justice

i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
byron

so,
so
your
constitutional
argument
says
that
even
you
picketed
safeway
generally
and
said,
don't
deal
with
safeway
generally
because
safeway
is
dealing
with
the
apple
--
you
say
that's
unconstitutional?
