mr.
gold,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
distinguished
the
hughes
case
in
your
brief
by
quoting
at
some
length
from
professor
cox's
article.
and
he
in
turn
draws
a
distinction
between
picketing
back
by
the
threat
of
economic
sanctions
and
picketing
which
appeals
only
the
reason.
in
this
case,
i
guess
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
interference
with
delivery
involved.
now,
had
you
had
a
situation
in
which
--
although
your
message
was
precisely
the
same,
the
teamsters
cut
off
delivery
because
they
have
crossed
the
picket
line.
would
that
be
a
different
case
or
would
it
be
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
is
it,
it
seem
to
me
you
might
have
two
cases
in
which
the
message
is
precisely
the
same
in
terms
as
addressed
just
a
consumers
who
are
around
the
stores,
one
of
them
might
produce
economic
consequences
that
the
other
one
did
not.
would
they
be
equally
lawful
or
whether
legality
turn
on
--
on
and
whether
there
were
economic
--
adverse
economic
consequence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
cox's
distinction
didn't
turn
on
the
legality
of
the
economic
sanction.
i
think,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
he
was
suggesting
that
picketing
would
be
unprotected
if
it
had
this
economic
consequences
even
though
it
were
perfectly
lawful
for
the
--
say,
the
teamsters
to
cut
off
deliveries
because
they
don't
want
to
cut.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
--
i
wonder
if
the
hughes
case
isn't
pretty
close
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
unlawful
ultimate
object
there
is
to
urge
affirmative
action
as
i
remember
it.
