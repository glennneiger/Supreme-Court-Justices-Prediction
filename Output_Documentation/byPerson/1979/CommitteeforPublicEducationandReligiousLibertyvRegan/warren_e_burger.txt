we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1369,
committee
for
public
education
against
regan.
mr.
pfeffer,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
statute
not
cover--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
statute
not
cover
schools
that
are
not
religiously
sponsored?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
pays
for
the
testing
in
the
public
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
testing
is
more
or
less
neutral
than
textbooks,
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
transportation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
it
was
constitutional
if
the
tests
were
sent
in
to
the
state
board
of
education,
let
them
do
all
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
isn't
very
important
where
they're
graded,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
emphasized
the
entangelement
aspect
a
few
minutes
ago,
mr.
pfeffer.
now,
the
states--all
of
the
states,
i
think,
reserve
the
right
to
inspect
and
call
for
reports
on
the
qualifications
of
the
teachers
in
private
schools
and
the
curriculum
and
the
other
conduct
to
see
that
it
meets
minimum
state
standards;
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
in
fact,
the
states
all
do
that,
do
they
not?
they
don't
just
assume
that
every
private
school
is
teaching
all
the
things
they
should
teach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
states
do
that
with
respect
to
all
the
pupils
in
all
the
religious
schools,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
but
they
do
come
into
the
schools
and
test
and
require
them
to
make
reports.
now,
that's
quite
a
bit
of
entanglement,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
audit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
pfeffer.
mrs.
siegel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
"compensated,"
that
non
public
schools
are
compensated,
are
you
referring
to
the--that
the
non-public
school
costs
of
the
examination
and
the
attendance
record
is
paid
for
by
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
truant
officers
come
into
these
private
schools,
church
schools--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
check
the
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
claim
that
that's
part
of
the
entanglement
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
cost
figure
for
that
particular
test
reflected
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
every
time
we
decide
one
of
these
church-state
cases,
some
group
of
people
think
it's
a
retreat,
and
others
think
it's
an
advance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
think
we'll
ask
you
to
fragment
your
argument.
we'll
let
you
go
on
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
nolan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nolan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
went
to
trial--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--whose
burden
would
it
be
to
show
exclusion
of--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
percentage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
an
optional
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
nolan.
mr.
pfeffer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
