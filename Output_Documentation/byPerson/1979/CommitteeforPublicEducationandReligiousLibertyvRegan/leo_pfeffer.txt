mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
another
chapter,
but
i'm
afraid,
not
the
last
chapter,
in
the
continuing
effort,
now
more
than
a
decade
old,
in
efforts
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
appropriate
moneys
raised
through
taxation
of
all
citizens,
irrespective
of
their
religion,
to
finance
schools
closed
to
many
for
no
reason
other
than
their
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
pardon?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
statute
covers
private
schools
that
are
not
religiously
sponsored,
but
i
have
no
idea
why
one
of
the
private
schools
which
are
not
religious,
horace
mann,
has
joined
in
this
suit
as
intervenor.
we
do
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
law;
this
was
decided
by
this
court
previously.
but
insofar
as
non-religious
schools
are
concerned,
there's
no
constitutional
barrier
to
the
type
of
statutes
here
involved.
the
challenge
here
is
exclusively
to
schools
which
exclude,
and
claim
the
right
to
exclude
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
persons
who
are
not
of
their
religion
to
which
the
school
is
dedicated.
the
question--specifically,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
establishment
clause
of
a
state
statute
providing
reimbursement
to
religious
schools
for
the
cause
of
mandated
record-keeping
and
testing.
i
think
there
is
the
prior
history
of
this
statute
is
significant
to
the
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
present
statute.
the
prior
statute
provided
for
financing
by
pupil
allotment
the
cost
of
tests
prepared
by
church
schools,
which
might
be
used
for
religious
instruction,
and
which
lacked
auditing
provisions.
the
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
levitt
v.
committee
for
public
education
and
religious
liberty.
then
a
new
statute,
providing
payment
for
teachers'
services,
and
conducting
state-prepared
tests,
and
in
pupil
attendance
reporting,
was
enacted.
this
was
to
be
on
an
actual
cost,
rather
than
a
per
pupil
allotment.
the
law
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
in
1976.
on
appeal,
this
court
vacated
the
judgment,
and
remanded
the
case
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
its
concurrent
decision
in
wolman
against
walter.
on
remand,
the
district
court
held
by
a
vote
of
2-1
that
while
the
original
decision
was
correct
on
the
basis
of
then-existing
law,
the
law
from
lemon
against
kurtzman
through
meek
against
pittenger,
wolman,
and
i
quote
to
you,
relaxed
some
of
meek's
constitutional
strictures
against
state
aid
to
sectarian
schools,
and
it
revived
the
more
flexible
concept
that
aid
to
a
sectarian'
school's
educational
activity
is
permissible
if
it
can
be
shown
with
a
high
degree
of
certainty
that
the
aid
will
only
have
a
secular
value
of
legitimate
interest
to
the
state,
and
does
not
present
any
appreciable
risk
of
being
used
to
aid
in
the
transmission
of
religious
views,
end
of
quotation.
in
its
original
decision,
the
court
had
held
that
the
statute
had
a
principal
and
primary
effect
which
advanced
religion.
and
therefore
the
court
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
unconstitutionally
fostered
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
on
remand,
the
majority
of
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
passed
muster
here,
too.
it
is
our
contention
that
wolman
does
not
mandate
either
a
more
flexible
concept
in
respect
to
the
establishment
clause,
nor
determination
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
statute.
specifically
as
to
the
latter,
we
urge
that
wolman
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
facts,
and
therefore
does
not
mandate
a
holding
of
constitutionality.
as
to
the
more
flexible
interpretation
of
the
establishment
clause,
we
urge
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
wolman
manifest
no
intention
to
overrule
sub
silentio
what
has
been
held
in
all
relevant
cases,
in
1971
through
meek
and
thereafter.
wolman,
we
submit,
is
clearly
distinguishable.
there
the
court
expressly
noted
that
the
ohio
statute
[illegible
words]
did
not
authorize
any
payment
to
non-public
school
personnel,
nor
did
the
non-public
school
personnel
participate
in
the
drafting
or
scoring
of
the
tests.
the
court
said
in
wolman,
and
i
should
like
to
quote
it,
"these
tests
are
used
to
measure
the
progress
of
students
in
secular
subjects.
non-public
school
personnel
are
not
involved
in
either
the
drafting
or
the
scoring
of
the
tests.
the
statute
does
not
authorize
any
payment
to
non-public
school
personnel
for
the
costs
of
administering
the
tests."
and
what
i
consider
a
very
significant
footnote,
footnote
7,
the
court
said,
and
again
i
quote,
"no
national
aid
is
involved
in
ohio.
the
tests
themselves
are
provided.
and
further,
it
does
not,"--the
statute,--"does
not
reimburse
schools
for
costs
incurred
in
tests.
no
money
flows
to
the
non-public
school
or
parent."
and
the
rest
of
the
quote
is
in
my
brief.
in
the
present
case,
religious
schools
are
involved
in
the
scoring
of
the
tests.
payment
for
the
services
is
made,
not
to
an
outside
secular
testing
corporation,
nor
even
to
the
religious
school's
teaching
personnel,
but
to
the
religious
school
itself,
which
we
suggest,
represents
an
even
more
flagrant
violation
to
the
establishment
clause.
nor
as
in
wolman
is
the
grading
done
by
an
outside
secular
corporation,
but
by
the
personnel
of
the
religious
school
itself.
testing,
i
suggest,
is
universally
recognized
by
educators
as
being
part
of
the
teaching
process.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
taxpayers
who
control
the
public
schools.
the
thesis
which
i
believe
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
predicated
upon
is
that
if
an
institution
is
supported
by
taxes
paid
by
all,
irrespective
of
their
religion,
the
money
so
raised
cannot
be
used
to
finance
educational
institutions--i
don't
go
beyond
that--educational
institutions
which
are
closed
to
some
of
the
taxpayers
for
no
reason
other
than
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
in
wolman
that
it
was
not
happy
with
the
decision
in
respect
to
textbooks,
but
it
felt
bound
by
the
fact
that
in
1968
the
majority
of
this
court
found
the
loaning
of
textbooks
to
be
constitutional.
but--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
let
me
finish
with
textbooks
first,
and
i'll
come
to
transportation.
but
the
court
made
it
quite
clear,
by
its
decision
in
that
case,
that
it
was
not
going
to
go
one
inch
beyond
what
it
was
mandated
to
do
under
the
basis
of
stare
decisis,
by
the
textbook
case.
in
respect
to
transportation,
i
think
a
better
case--although
i
personally
do
not
agree
with
the
decision,
nor
did
five
justices
who
dissented--transportion
i
think
can
be
justified--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
four
justices;
four
justices
dissented,
sorry;
it
was
a
5-4
decision.
that
in
the
everson
case,
the
bus
transportation
case,
i
think
a
reasonable
case
can
made
for
the
argument
that
this
is
like
medical
and
dental
lunches,
a
welfare
rather
than
an
educational
expenditure.
and
in
respect
to
welfare,
health,
and
so
on,
exclusion
of
pupils
in
parochial
schools
would
probably
violate
the
equal
protection
clause;
might--might
violate
it.
nor
as
in
wolman
is
the
grading
done
by
outside
secular
corporations,
but
the
personnel
of
the
religious
school
itself.
testing
is
universally
recognized
by
educators
as
being
part
of
the
teaching
process.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
is
it
not
very
important
whether--?
well,
from
my
viewpoint,
it
is
not.
but
it
has
at
least
some
defensibility.
i
think
why
it's
not
significant,
important,
is
because
it
is
a
educational
service.
i
think
the
case
is
more
grievous
where
this
educational
testing
is
done
by
religious
teachers,
and
you
cannot
even,
even
in
the
statute
here
which
provides
that
essay
questions
are
marked,
are
graded
initially--initially
by
the
parochial
school
personnel,
you
cannot
divorce
the
personal
religious
predilections
of
the
tester
from
the
grading
of
the
paper.
it
just--i
don't
think
a
person
committed
to
religion
can
divide
himself
into
two
parts
and
close
his
eyes
to
answers
which
violate
what
he
believes
to
be
god's
word.
in
respect
to
record-keeping,
i
come
to
this
now,
recall
the
court's
attention
to
walz
v.
tax
commission,
where
it
upheld
tax
exemption
for
churches
on
the
grounds
that
non-exemption
would
have
required
the
government
to
audit
and
examine
the
operations
and
records
of
churches,
and
thus
entangle
it
in
their
religious
affairs.
the
court
said,
obviously
a
direct
money
subsidy
would
be
a
relationship
pregnant
with
involvement,
and
as
with
most
governmental
grant
programs,
could
encompass
sustained,
detailed
administrative
relationships
for
enforcement
of
statutory
or
administrative
standards.
we
call
this
court's
attention
to
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
and
earley
v.
dicenso.
there,
the
court
struck
down
statutes
providing
financial
aid
to
church
schools
to
compensate
them
for
so-called
non-ideological
services.
the
full
quotation
is
on
page
15
of
my
brief.
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
italicized
sentences,
which
i
should
like
to
read
briefly.
there,
in
that
case,
the
court
said
-
the
program
requires
the
government
to
examine
the
school's
records,
in
order
to
determine
how
much
of
the
total
expenditure
is
attributable
to
secular
education
and
how
much
to
religious
activity.
the
present
statute
requires
that.
then,
later
on,
the
court
said
-
in
particular,
the
government's
post
audit
power
to
inspect
and
evaluate
the
church-related
school's
financial
records,
and
to
determine
which
expenditures
are
religious
and
which
are
secular
creates
an
intimate
and
continuing
relationship
between
church
and
state.
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
a
school
hands
in
a
record
saying,
we
spend
x
hours
for
taking
attendance,
and
no
more,
and
the
amount
there
indicated
for
taking
attendance
is
disproportionate
to
other,
public
schools,
time
spent
in
those
schools
for
record-keeping,
there
would
be
an
obligation
upon
the
state
to
inspect
and
examine
how
come
you
spent
three
times
as
much
time
on
attendance
taking
than
outside
schools?
that
very
question,
and
the
obligation
of
the
religious
schools
to
answer
that,
entangles
states
in
religion;
and
i
think
it's
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
quite
know
whether
the
racial
aspect
of
your
question
is
significant.
if
it
is,
then
i'd
say
that
the
tests
in
respect
to
entanglement
just
doesn't
apply
to
race.
on
the
contrary,
the
courts
are--governments
are
very
entangled
in
seeking
to
remedy
history
of
past
discrimination
with
respect
to
race.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
i
would
say
that
any
kind
of
testing,
any
kind
of
supervision,
any
kind
of
determination
as
to
expenditures
which
are
religious,
as
from
those
which
are
secular,
constitute
impermissible
entanglement.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
could
answer
that
by
suggesting
that
you
could
justify
even--i
would
not--but
you
could
justify
on
the
basis
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
expenditure
of
state
funds
for
purposes
related
to
the
health
of
the
pupils.
and
if
you
could
make
an
arguable
case--if
you
could
make
an
arguable
case,
that
football
is
so
related--i
do
not
agree
with
it--but
if
you
could
make
an
arguable
case
that
football
is
so
related
to
the
healthiness
of
the
students,
i
think
the
court
has
ruled
in
respect
to
gymnasiums
you
may
not,
but
in
respect--football
is
so
related
to
the
health
of
the
students
that
it
is
not
part
of
the
educational
process;
perhaps.
personally,
i
would
not
accept
that
argument;
but
the
court
might
very
well.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
does--well,
it
does
not
require
it
to.
i
think--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
my
answer
to
that
is--i
think
the
answer
is
no.
suppose
a
parent,
for
non-religious
reasons,
is
disgusted
with
our
whole
school
system,
public,
private,
parochial,
non-parochial,
and
says,
we
can
teach
the
child
better
ourselves
at
home.
i
think
that
parent
has
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
but
the
state
also
has
a
constitutional
right
under
its
police
power
to
impose
such
tests
upon
that
child
to
determine
whether
that
child
has,
in
effect,
been
given
the
equivalent
of
a
school
education,
and
the
parent
has
therefore
complied
with
the
statutory
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
a
child
receives
a
basic
primary
education.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
they
don't
finance
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
only
if--well,
if
there
is
no
alternative,
if
the
state
comes
in
and
determines
the
amount
to
be
paid
to
that
school
on
the
basis
of
how
many
school
children
are
present
and
how
many
are
not
present,
whether
how
many
are
excused
for
lawful
absence
and
how
many
not
excused,
i
think
that
constitutes
an
entitlement
which,
while--which
is
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause.
in
the
broadest
sense
the
other
critical
issue
now
before
the
court
is,
we
suggest,
as
a
majority
held
whether--rather
the
majority
held
this
court
has
relaxed
some
of
the
meeks
constitutional
strictures
against
state
aid
to
parochial
schools;
and
if
it
has,
were
the
relaxations
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
justify
the
decision
in
this
case.
and
it's
to
this
issue
that
i
will
devote
the
balance
of
my
initial
presentation.
we
suggest
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
assuming
that
this
court
has
retreated
from
its
prior--takes
this
position
in
respect
to
aid
to
parochial
schools.
the
error
of
this
assumption
is
manifested
in
the
court's
disposition
of
three
cases
which
came
to
it
after
wolman.
the
first
of
these
was
new
york
v.
cathedral
academy,
decided
in
the
same
term
as
wolman,
but
after
wolman.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
if
the
challenged
statutes
authorized
payments
for
the
identical
services,
that
ought
to
be
reimbursed
under
the
law
held
unconstitutional
in
levitt.
it
was
invalid
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
previous
law
was
held
invalid.
if
on
the
other
hand,
it
empowered
the
new
york
court
of
claims
to
make
an
independent
audit
on
the
basis
of
which
it
was
to
authorize
reimbursement
for
clearly--for
the
sake
of
the
services,
such
a
detailed
inquiry
would
itself
impel
impermissible
entanglement.
the
very
inquiry,
the
very
going
in
there
to
check
constitutes
entanglement.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
cathedral
academy;
it's
not
less
true
here.
the
court
there
said,
the
prospect
of
church
and
state
litigating
about
what
does
or
does
not
have
a
religious
meaning
touches
the
very
core
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
against
religious
establishment.
and
it
cannot
be
dismissed
by
saying
that
it
will
happen
only
once.
the
second
indication
that
the
court
in
wolman
did
not
intend
to
water
down
or
retreat
from
the
principles
announced
in
meek
v.
pittenger,
is
indicated
from
its
opinion
this
year
in
nlrb
v.
catholic
bishop
of
chicago.
there
the
court
said,
and
i
quote
again,
only
recently
we
again
noted
the
importance
of
the
teacher's
function
in
a
church
school,
whether
the
subject
is
remedial
reading,
advanced
reading,
or
simply
reading.
a
teacher
remains
a
teacher,
and
the
danger
that
religious
factors
will
become
entwined
with
secular
instruction
persists.
and
cites
meek
v.
pittenger
for
that
proposition.
it
is,
we
respectfully
submit,
not--most
unusual
for
the
court
to
base
its
determination
on
a
decision,
which
as
the
court
below
held,
it
had
so
recently
compromised.
finally,
we
should
also
like
to
call
the
court's
position
a
bare
six
months
ago
of
the
case
of
byrne
v.
public
funds
for
public
schools
of
new
jersey.
there
the
court
summarily
affirmed
a
court
of
appeals
decision
invalidating
a
provision
in
the
new
jersey
income
tax
law
granting
tax
benefits
to
parents
who
pay
tuition
for
children
attending
religious
schools.
that
decision
held
that
under
this
court's
1973
in
committee
for
public
education
and
religious
liberty
v.
nyquist,
the
challenged
new
jersey
law
could
not
stand.
the
affirmance
in
byrne,
we
suggest,
cannot
be
easily
reconciled
with
the
district
court's
assumption
in
the
present
case,
that
this
court
has
retreated
from
all
that
it
has
held,
and
it
has
said
through
the
many
cases
from
levitt
to
the
present
time.
may
i
conclude
with
this--conclude
with
this.
these
cases
are
based
on
the
implicit
categorical
imperative
that
it
is
morally
wrong,
and
constitutionally
impermissible,
to
compel
all
persons,
regardless
of
their
religion,
to
pay
taxes
used
to
finance
the
operations
of
schools
from
which
some
of
them
are
excluded
solely
because
of
their
religion.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
one
of
the
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is--deals
with
whether
these
schools--and
it
was
also
asked
by
mr.
nolan--whether
the
schools
which
have
intervened
in
this
case
do
discriminate
in
their
admissions
policy
in
respect
to
religion.
we
didn't
sue
these
intervenors.
they
voluntarily
intervened,
and
therefore,
those
who
intervened,
i
would
assume
were
intervened
because
they
reflected
the
best
possible
picture.
and
i
think
that's
really
the
issue.
i
think
that
avoids
the
issue.
it's
a
basic--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
the--i
must
say
that
evidence
is
irrelevant,
for
the
reason
which
i
will
state
in
a
moment.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
stating
it
right
now.
i
mean
right
now.
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
these
schools
or
other
schools
do
or
do
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion.
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
they
have
a
right,
a
constitutional
right,
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion.
whether
or
not--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
i
did
that,
i
apologize.
my
argument
is
that
they
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
under
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters,
and
others,
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion.
whether
they
exercised
that
right
or
not,
is
noted
in
the
factual--of
this
case.
they
should
not
constitutionally
be
allowed
to
receive
taxes
at
all,
irrespective
of
religion,
if
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
exclude.
this
is
the
foundation
of
our
case.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
because
they
have
a
right
to
exclude;
that's
what
i'm
saying.
because
they
have
the
right
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
their
religion,
then
i
say
you
cannot
tax
all
people
to
pay
for
the
maintenance
of
a
school
which
can
exclude
you
if
they
want.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
yes;
it
is
because
they're
religiously--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
there's
no
constitutional--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
methodists
is
an
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no
question
about
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pierce
involved
a
secular
school
as
well
as
a
religious
one.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
the
issue
in
pierce,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
member
of
this
court
would
say
that--or
should
say--that
a
school
which
is
constitutionally
permitted
to
exclude
persons
because
of
their
religion--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
they
have
a
constitutional
right?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
but
if
they
do
that--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
if
horace
mann
receives
money,
it
has
a
constitutional
right
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion.
but
it
has
no
reconstitutional
right
to
receive
public
funds
if
it
does
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
do
not
think--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
don't
believe
my
position--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
i
don't
think
so.
i'll
repeat
what
i
said
at
the
beginning.
i'll
repeat
it.
it's
been
our
position
all
along
that
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
exclude
because
of
religion,
you
cannot
constitutionally
use
funds
raised
by
compulsive
taxation
of
all
irrespective
of
their
religion.
this
is
the
categorical
imperative
which
i
believe
the
first
amendment
stands
upon.
now--i
suggest,
too,
that
independent
of
that,
surveillance
which
is
forbidden
in
respect
to
religion
is
necessary--state
surveillance--is
necessary
to
its--if
public
funds
are
used
for
that
school,
whether
it's
record-keeping,
whether
it's
instruction,
if
you
use
public
funds,
then
the
public,
the
state,
has
a
right
to
see
that
those
funds
are
used
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
state.
the
very
involvement,
entanglement,
of
the
state
to
check
whether--the
law
in
this
court
has
said
so;
i'm
not
inventing
this--to
check
whether
or
not
the
law's
complied
with,
that
very
surveillance
constitutes
impermissible
entanglement,
which
forbids
the
use
of
public
funds
in
that
case.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you
very
much.
