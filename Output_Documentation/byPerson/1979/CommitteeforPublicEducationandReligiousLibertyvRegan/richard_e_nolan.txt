mr.
richard
e.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
argue
here
on
behalf
of
the
intervenor
schools,
four
of
which
are
religiously
affiliated.
i'd
like
to
say
one
thing
in
the
beginning,
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
mr.
pfeffer
made
to
the
effect
that
these
schools
discriminate
in
admissions
against
persons
not
of
their
religious
faiths.
the
four
religiously
affiliated
schools
have
each
executed
answers
to
plaintiffs'
interrogatories,
answer
#
5,
denying
that
they
imposed
religious
restrictions
or
preferences
on
admissions.
i
think
that
that
is
borne
out
at
least
as
to
the
roman
catholic
schools,
by
the
fact
that
in
manhattan,
in
the
elementary
schools
conducted
by
the
archdiocese
of
new
york
in
manhattan,
16-1/2
percent
of
the
children
in
those
schools
are
non-catholic.
and
there
are
various
other
statistics
for
other
areas.
but
i
think
at
least
the
schools
in
new
york
take
great
pride
in
the
fact
that,
far
from
discriminating
against
non-catholics
inadmissions,
they
have
consciously
kept
open
schools
in
inner
city
core
areas,
where
the
population
of
catholics
has
declined.
they
have
kept
those
schools
open,
and
they
have
taken
care,
in
an
educational
sense,
of
significant
numbers
of
non-catholics.
and
i
think
that
is--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that.
there
are
the
answers
to
admissions.
but
i
checked
yesterday
as
to
what
the
percentages
were--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
don't
believe
so,
no,
sir.
but
there
is
no
evidence--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
any
claim
that
they
do
discriminate.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
and
there
is
affirmative
evidence
with
respect
to
the
four
religiously
affiliated
schools,
in
answers
to
interrogatories,
in
which
they
each
deny
that
they
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
it
did
not.
it
went
off
in
the
context
almost
of
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
not
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
no,
no;
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
point
was
never
raised,
to
my
knowledge,
either
in
the
first
or
second
phases
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
if
we
went
to
trial--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
plaintiffs'
burden,
but
i
think
we
would
put
in
statistical
evidence
with
respect
to
the
number
of
non-catholic
children
in
the
various
catholic,
jewish,
lutheran
and
other
schools
that
are
involved
in
the
program
under
review.
getting
back
to
this
program,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
over
again
what
mrs.
siegel
has
said,
but
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
talking
a
little
bit
about
just
what
this
program
is.
first
of
all,
it
involves
attendance-keeping
and
reporting.
this
is
required
by
the
state
of
new
york.
this
is
not
something
the
schools
do
on
a
voluntary
basis,
or
they
very
well
might.
but
it
is
required,
to
insure
compliance
with
the
compulsory
education
law
of
new
york.
the
people
who
keep
these
records,
or
compile
these
records--and
this
is
based
on
the
stipulation
of
fact
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix--the
people
who
compile
these
records
are
typically
secretaries
in
the
main
office
or
the
front
office
of
the
school.
they
are
not
people
who
have
anything
to
do
with
the
education
or
the
instructional
function.
they
are
simply
counting
heads
on
a
daily
basis
to
be
able
to
make
the
reports
that
are
required
by
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
fail
to
see
any
ideological
content
in
that
type
of
activity.
i
may
say
that,
as
the
district
court
found,
that
the
great
bulk--the
lion's
share,
i
think
they
said--of
the
money
that
is
paid,
85,
90
percent,
somewhere
through
there,
is
for
the
maintenance
of
attendance
records,
preparation
of
attendance
reports.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
85-95
i
think
was
the
phrase
used
in
the
district
court
opinion.
but
it's
the
great
bulk,
the
lion's
share,
as
judge
mansfield
said.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
as
i
understand
it,
they
are,
your
honor;
they
are
the
same
forms
that
are
used.
the
parochial
schools
are
required--and
it
may
also
be
that
the
public
schools
are
also
required--to
submit
various
reports
based
on
those
records;
and
also
to
submit
the
so-called
beds
report
which
goes
in
once
a
year,
the
basic
educational
data
system
report,
which
shows
on
a
yearly
basis
people's
faculty,
courses
given,
and
other
information
concerning
the
schools.
and
i
think
that
is
done
both
for
the
public
and
the
nonpublic
schools.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
horace
mann-barnard
school
was
initially
joined
because
of
the
attack
on
the
statute.
horace
mann
is
a
fairly
large
school
with
a
stake
in
the
financial
side
of
this.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
it
is
nondenominational.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
yes,
yes.
and
i
think
that
mr.
pfeffer,
for
the
first
time
in
the
proceedings,
oh,
before
the
court
on
the
second
phase
of
this
case,
agreed
that
he
really
sought
no
relief
against
horace
mann.
but
basically
what
i
am
here
talking
about--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
historic
vestige.
what
i'm
here
talking
about
are
the
religiously
affiliated
schools,
which
to
some
degree
conform,
and
to
some
degree
do
not
conform,
according
to
the
answers
to
interrogatories,
with
the
profile
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
the
past.
but
getting
back
to
what
this
statute
does,
apart
from
attendance,
it
provides
for
various
testing--standardized,
state-prepared
tests,
which
are
prepared
by
the
department
of
education
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
made
available
to
public
and
non
public
schools,
they
are
the
same
tests
but
are
made
available
used
in
the
public
schools.
these
basically
involve
several
types
of
tests.
the
regents
scholership
examinations
which
are
given
to
persons
seeking
new
york
state
regents
examination
at
the
end
of
high
school,
these
are
prepared
by
and
graded
by
the
personnel
of
the
new
york
state
education
department.
the
only
thing
that
the
schools
do,
the
non
public
schools
do
it
would
be
to
recieve
the
test
under
very
secure
circumstances
sealed
kept
in
under
lock
and
key
distribute
those
tests
at
the
place
of
testing,
pick
them
up
send
the
test
back
to
and
i
suppose
people
order
in
the
class
room.
we
also
have
the
people
evaluation
progragm,
the
pep,
and
that
is
the
test
that
is
given
i
think
in
third,
perhaps
sixth
and
ninth
grade
to
measure
confidence
in
reading
and
mathamatics
and
is
basic,
in
fact
its
completely
an
objective
multiple
choice
type
test.
it
is
given
again
to
children
in
non
public
and
public
schools,
it
is
graded
in
the
non
public
schools
either
by
machine
or
by
hand
by
the
personnel
of
school
but
basically
what
you
are
talking
about
is
simply
the
teacher
putting
at
overlay
and
i
am
reffering
now
to
exibit
11
to
the
stipulation
of
fact
which
is
the
one
of
the
new
york
state
test
in
reading
for
grade
nine,
simply
put
the
overlay
over
and
see
which
places
the
child
has
marked
properly.
there's
no
discretion
at
all
involved
in
this.
then
you
have
the
regents
examination,
which
are
the
end-of-course
examinations
that
are
given
in
a
number
of
secular
subjects
in
the
public
schools
and
in
the
private
schools.
and
these
are
the
ultimate
measures,
if
you
will,
of
educational
competence
in
secular
subjects
in
new
york.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
believe
all
students
take
it,
but
you
can
only
get
a
regents
degree
if
you
have
passed
the
regents
examination.
but
i
believe
it
is
required
for
all
children.
but
this
is,
again,
to
a
very
large
extent,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
an
objective,
multiple
choice
examination
type
of
test,
where
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
grading
process.
there
are
a
few,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
a
very
few,
essay
questions
on
various
topics
relevant
to
the
particular
examination.
those
are
graded
by
the
school
personnel.
but
the
state
provides,
along
with
the
examinations,
the
state
provides
rating
guidelines,
specific
rating
guidelines,
as
to
how
these
people
are
to
do
it.
and
in
addition,
the
schools
are
required
to
send
both
the
passing
and
failing
papers
to
albany,
where
they
are
checked
by
state
personnel
on
a
random
basis.
so
again,
there
is
minimal--minimal
opportunity
for
any
involvement.
there
certainly--at
that
stage
in
the
game,
these
tests
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
instructional
phase
of
education.
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
would
be
the
possibility
that
some
child
might
try
to
curry
favor
with
a
teacher
by
using
a
religiously
oriented
answer.
but
that
is
indoctrination,
if
you
will,
coming
back
the
other
way.
it
is
not
indoctrination
of
the
child.
i
think
that
this
statute
is,
in
all
respects,
constitutional
under
wolman,
as
i
think
it
is
is
modified
by
meek.
even
if
it
is
not
modified
by
meek,
i
think
it
is
constitutional
under
meek.
