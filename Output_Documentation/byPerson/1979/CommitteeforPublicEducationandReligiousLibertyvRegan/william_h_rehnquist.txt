justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pfeffer,
supposing
a
state
adopted
a
program
whereby
it
said
that
any
school
which
had
a
system
of
lights
for
its
stadium
would
be
reimbursed
for
athletic
events
conducted
in
the
stadium,
but
not
for
any
educational
event
conducted
in
the
stadium.
and
it
was
drawn
to
the
state's
attention
that
a
particular
parochial--this
was
state--this
was
public
schools
and
parochial
schools.
and
it
was
drawn
to
the
state's
attention
that
a
particular
parochial
school
was
sending
in
bills
that
were
twice
as
high
as
a
public
school,
and
the
answer
given
by
the
school
is,
we
conduct
twice
as
many
athletic
events?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
talking
about
race
here.
i
thought
it
was
religion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
then
answer
my
question
as
to
whether
a
state
program
and
provides
any
school,
parochial
or
public,
which
has
a
stadium
that
is
lighted
at
night
will
be
reimbursed
by
the
state
for
any
athletic
event
conducted
in
the
stadium,
but
not
for
any
scholastic
events
conducted.
and
a
particular
parochial
school
sends
in
a
bill
to
the
state
that's
twice
as
high
as
any
public
a
school.
and
there
answer,
when
the
state
questions
them
as
you
say
they
must,
is,
just
that
we
play
twice
as
many
football
games
as
the
public
schools.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
siegel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
true
that
the
private
schools
which
obtain
the
reimbursement
in
new
york
state
exclude
people
because
of
religion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
understood
mr.
pfeffer
to
say
categorically
that
they
simply
eliminated
them
on
the--excluded
them
on
the
basis
of
religion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
this
case
has
gone
to
trial,
i
take
it
a
trier
of
fact
would
have
been
at
liberty
to
disbelieve
the
statements
made.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
didn't
go
to
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
the
only
litigants
that
we
have
before
the
court
in
that
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
state
it
right
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
how
you
phrased
your
argument
on
your
original
submission,
during
your
direct.
you
stated
it--discrimination--as
a
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
pierce
was
decided
long
before
the
first
amendment
was
held
applicable
to
the
states.
it
was
on
the
constitutional
fourteenth
amendment
right,
you
have
a
right
to
send
your
child
to
a
private
school.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
changed
your
position.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
changed
your
position
completely.
which
is
all
right.
that's
the
way
lawyers
go.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
vacillated
all
over
the
lot.
