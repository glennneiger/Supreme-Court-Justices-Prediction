justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
fact
been
found
or
not
found
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
in
the
opinions
or
the
findings
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
should
we
judge
it?
that
they
do
discriminate,
or
that
they
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
argument
presented
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case
at
any
time
has
it
been
argued
that
because--because
these
schools--one
of
the
reasons
why
this
money
may
not
be
given
to
these
schools
is
that
they
discriminate?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
claim
ever
been
made
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
had,
and
the
court
didn't
decide,
you
would
think
the
court
had
said
-
well,
even
if
they
discriminate--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
whether
these
schools
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion
or
not,
these
payments
are
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
isn't
because
these
schools
are
religiously
connected
that
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
a
private
school
that
isn't
controlled
by
any
religion--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
just
decided
that
it
doesn't
like
methodists.
and
they--and
here's
a
private
school
that
just
excludes
methodists.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
horace
mann
in
this
case.
horace
mann
has
the
constitutional
right
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
religion
if
it
wants
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
say
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
other
case
i
have
for
announcement,
which
is
the
committee
for
public
education
against
regan,
the
comptroller
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
--
this
case
involves
a
new
york
statute
which
reimburses
non-public
schools
including
religiously
oriented
schools,
reimburses
these
schools
for
certain
testing,
record
keeping
and
reporting
expenses.
the
--
a
three-judge
district
court
upheld
this
statute
and
we
affirm
that
judgment
believing
that
the
case
is
controlled
by
our
recent
decision
in
wolman
against
walter.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
