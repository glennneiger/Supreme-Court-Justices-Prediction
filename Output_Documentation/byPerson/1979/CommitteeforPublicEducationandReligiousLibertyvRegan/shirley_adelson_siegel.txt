ms.
shirley
adelson

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
law
that
is
before
you
today
is
simply
incidental
to
an
historic
and
very
long-standing
state
function
and
responsibility
to
see
that
attendance
is
taken
in
the
schools
at
the
elementary
and
secondary
school
level
throughout
the
state,
and
to
see
that
certain
minimum
standards
of
educational
achievement
are
met
by
administering
state-prepared,
state-mandated
tests
at
certain
levels.
the
public
schools
which
abide
by
these
identical
requirements,
are
compensated
through
the
rather
generous--it's
currently
running
$3.6
billion
a
year--state
aid
to
the
local
school
districts,
and
the
non-public
schools
are
compensated
under
this
act.
now,
this
court,
as
my--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
by
this
act
which
is
before
you
today.
now,
the
prior
act,
which
had
a
similar
purpose,
which
was
held
to
be
a
proper
secular
purpose
by
the
court
which
it
decided
the
levitt
case,
was
invalidated
because
of
the
fact
that
that
act
has
included
reimbursement
for
teacher-prepared
tests
which
were
deemed
to
be
such
a
part
of
the
overall,
integrated
teaching
process
which
was
part
of
a
religious
mission
of
many
of
these
schools
that
it
permeated
and,
in
effect,
poisoned
the
well
for
the
entire
statute,
and
since
they
were
lump
sum
payments
being
made,
based
on
the
number
of
pupils
in
each
school
under
that
act,
it
is
impossible
for
the
court
to
disentangle
the
amount,
and
to
determine
just
how
much
of
it
would
go
for
proper
secular
purposes.
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
final
paragraph
of
the
court
there,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
statute
which
was
then
promptly
adopted
by
the
state
and
is
before
you
today.
since
chapter
138
provides
only
for
a
single
per-pupil
allotment
for
a
variety
of
specified
services,
some
secular
and
some
potentially
religious,
neither
this
court
nor
the
district
court
can
properly
reduce
that
allotment
to
an
amount
corresponding
to
the
actual
costs
incurred
in
performing
reimbursable
secular
services.
that
is
a
legislative,
not
a
judicial
function.
and
so
with
the
adoption
of
this
new
statute,
the
appropriations
dropped
by
from
$28
million
to
$8
million
a
year,
where
they're
now
constant.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
the
intervenor
schools
that
are
involved
in
this
proceeding
have
in
their
answers
to
interrogatories
indicated
that
they
do
not
exclude
students
on
the
basis
of
religion;
however,
under
new
york
law,
the
schools
do
have
the
privilege
of
filing
a
form,
which
is
in
the
record,
and
which
indicates
that
they
want
to
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
which
the
law
gives
religiously
affiliated
schools
of
limiting
their
student
bodies
to
children
of
a
certain
faith.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
while
the
schools,
many
of
them,
have
filed
such
forms,
it
is
my
understanding--and
mr.
nolan
will
be
able
to
address
himself
to
that
specifically,
since
he
represents
the
intervenor
independent
schools
here
today,
that
these
particular
schools
have
answered
interrogatories
that
they
do
not.
they
do
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
students
or
faculty.
and
in
fact
such
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
flatly
denied
by
the
intervenor-defendant.
now,
the
main
thrust
of
the
challenge
to
the
new
statute
is
that
it
does
not
give
substantial
direct
aid
to
the
sectarian
enterprise
as
a
whole.
yet
this
court
has
rejected
the
argument
in
several
cases
that
just
the
freeing
up
of
private
funds
to
make
some
money
available
for
sectarian
purposes
would
not
invalidate
a
statute
which
had
its
own
proper
secular
purpose,
and
which
was
not
otherwise
an
entanglement
or
did
not
have
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion.
the--actually
under
this
new
statute,
by
far
the
lion's
share
of
the
money
is
going
to
the
keeping
of
attendance
records;
86.5
percent
last
year,
which
seems
to
be
typical.
and
this
is
largely
going
for
the
salaries--an
allocated
portion
of
the
gross
salary
of
the
personnel
in
the
school
that
take
attendance.
the
dissent
has--and
also,
my
learned
adversary--has
belittled
the
state's
interest
in
attendance-keeping,
stating
that
after
all,
taking
pupil
attendance
is
also
essential
to
the
school's
sectarian
function.
but
this
is
not
a
function
of
the
state
which
is
to
be
belittled.
truancy
is
very
much
of
a
court
matter.
the
attendance
records
are
presumptive
evidence
in
court
proceedings.
they're
of
great
concern
to
parents
who
are
pulled
before
the
court
in
child
neglect
proceedings.
the
truancy
officers
are
employed
by
the
public
school
district,
and
they
haul
into
court
the
children
in
the
non-public
schools
the
same
as
if
they
were
in
the
public
schools.
it
makes
no
difference.
and
the
state
board
of
education
itself
scrutinizes
with
great
interest
the
date
that
comes
from
all
of
the
schools,
public
or
non-public,
for
trends
as
to
dropouts,
illegal
absences,
transfers,
and
so
on.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes,
they
do.
these
records
are
official
records
which
must
be
retained
for
quite
a
few
years.
and
the
truancy
officers
may
be
requested
by
the
non-public
school
to
come
in
from
the
public
school
district,
or
they
may
because
of
the
court's
direction
or
acting
on
other
complaints,
come
directly
into
the
school.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
that
has
not
been
claimed
in
this
action.
i
don't
know
whether
my
adversary
would
claim
that.
but
nothing's
been
said
about
it.
now,
of
course,
the
fact
that
there's
an
incidental
benefit
to
the
private
school
in
that
it
would
like
to
have
pupil
attendance
records
anyway
is
an
incidental
benefit
which
certainly
should
not
detract
from
the
secular
purpose
of
attendance-keeping
which
is
such
a
fundamental
child
welfare
service.
the
incidental
benefits
in
the
sunday
closing
laws
and
in
the
busing
case,
and
ever
since--and
in
other
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
held
to
be
there.
i
mean,
it
may
be
an
incentive
to
parents
to
send
their
children
to
parochial
schools,
or
it
may
certainly
confer
some
benefit
on
the
school,
but
it
is
not
in
and
of
itself
a
reason
for
invalidating
a
statute,
just
because
they
might
have
some
incidental
benefit
from
it.
the
attendance
records
are
so
much
like
child
welfare
records
that
one
tends
really
to
think
it's
reasonable
to
include
them
in
the
same
category
as
busing
or
school
lunches
or
providing
lights
for
athletic
fields,
services
which
are
so
totally
secular
and
non-ideological
in
character,
and
here,
very
much
part
of
a
welfare
system.
and
we
recall
that
in
the
everson
case,
when
busing
was
upheld,
the
analogy
there
was
made
to
the
service
of
having
a
policeman
available
to
the
schools,
and
streets
and
sidewalks
and
so
on.
and
keeping
attendance
and
providing
the
welfare
services
that
go
with
it
is
really
in
that
category.
now
in
the
wolman
case--and
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
before
the
court
today
turns
on
whether
in
wolman
it
has
retreated
from
meek.
to
us,
it's
all
quite
consistent.
and
we
find
that
the
case
that
we're
presenting
to
you
falls
neatly
within
the
parameters
that
have
been
set
within
these
rather
definite
adjudications,
which
have
been
very
helpful
guidelines
to
the
legislature.
in
wolman,
the
matter
of
secular,
non-ideological
tests
was
squarely
before
the
court,
paid
for
by
the
state.
and
it
was
held
that
this
was
perfectly
acceptable;
there
was
no
primary
effect
to
advance
religion.
the
school
had
had
no
control
over
the
tests,
just
as
here.
the
logical
basis
for
making
any
distinction
between
contributions
in
kind
and
in
cash
to
the
school
would
seem
to
falter
if
you
have,
as
here,
a
situation
where
it
is
possible
to
trace
the
dollars
with
such
precision.
it
is
indeed
so
ministerial
and
such
nonjudgmental
kind
of
audit
that
has
to
be
made,
once--in
fact,
an
exhibit
in
this
record
shows
a
typical
teacher's
time
record
showing
one-quarter
hour
for
taking
attendance.
there
are
normal
ranges
that
are
well
known
to
the
state
education
department
as
to
how
long
it
should
take
to
take
attendance.
if
someone
exceeds
that
range,
they
may
then
look
to
see
whether
this
is
a
particularly
large
school;
there
may
be
other
factors.
or
they
may
pick
up
a
phone.
the
answer
to
the
interrogatories
by
one
of
the
intervenor-defendants
indicates
that
there
had
been
a
phone
call.
and
in
fact,
i
noted
with
interest
that
as
to
that
intervenor-defendant,
the
amount
of
money
they
had
received
was
substantially
less
than
they
had
requested.
and
i
think
it
was
because
they
probably
had
included
the
time
of
their
own
attendance
officer,
which
is
not
something
for
which
the
state
reimburses.
the
state
reimburses
only
for
the
attendance
keeping.
now,
the
state
reimbursement
here
is
for
a
very
special
service,
aside
from
this
over
86
percent
of
this
money
which
goes
for
the
attendance
keeping,
child
welfare
service,
there
is
an
annual
statistics
report
on
pupil
enrollment,
facilities
that
are
available,
the
number
of
handicapped
children,
and
so
on,
and
that
is
the
same
information
that
comes
in
from
public
schools
throughout
the
state.
it
is
immediately
computerized
and
made
available
and
used
for
so
many
various
purposes
that
it's
really--it's
hard
to
identify.
but
it
is
the
basic
profile
of
the
schools
throughout
the
state.
the
balance
of
the
money
goes
for
administering--administering
is
a
very
good
word,
because
they're
really
administrative
tasks
almost
entirely.
the
state-prepared
and
state-required
tests.
and
these
can
very
briefly
be
described
to
you.
first,
there
are
the
reading
and
math
tests
which
are
totally
objective,
and
which
are
given
to
all
third
grade
and
sixth
grade
students
throughout
the
state,
whether
they're
in
public
or
non-public
schools.
this--it
happens
that
these
tests
developed
out
of
the
federal
act
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965,
and
the
results
of
the
test,
which
are
given
to
the
state,
target
the
schools
where
there
are
low-achieving
pupils,
who
will
then
be
made
available--made
eligible
for
the
resources
under
the
federal
act.
they
are
scored
by
the
teachers,
and
the
rating
guides
are
given
so
that
the
teachers
don't
even
have
to
make
any
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
two
and
two
is
four,
because
the
answers
are
all
set
down
for
them.
the
next
group
of
tests
for
which
reimbursement
is
provided
are
basic
competency
tests,
which
are
now
being
required.
in
june
of
this
year
for
the
first
time,
all
high
school
graduates
throughout
the
state,
in
order
to
get
their
diplomas,
have
to
pass
a
math
and
reading
test,
and
that
is
something
that
is
required
of
these
schools
as
well,
and--the
giving
of
such
a
tests,
which
is
marked--has
no
essay
questions
at
all,
marked
at
the
schools,
is
reimbursed.
and
finally,
in
the
more--in
the
example
to
which
i
believe
mr.
pfeffer
referred,
are
the
regents
examinations.
these,
again,
are
prepared
by
the
state,
and
they
are
marked
initially
by
the
teachers
of
the
schools.
these
are
examinations
which
are
given
for
college-bound
students;
not
all
secondary
school
students
take
these
tests.
the
satisfactory
completion
of
the
state-designed
courses
of
study
which
lead
to
the
regents
examination,
and
together
with
the
taking
of
those
courses
and
so
on,
may
make
a
student
eligible
for
a
regents
diploma,
which
is
a
special
diploma,
considered
meaningful
by
our
state
university,
for
example,
for
admission
purposes;
and
a
historic
tradition
that
goes
way
back.
now,
it's
since
1865
that
these
regents
examinations
have
been
given
statewide
to
secondary
school
students
who
were
eligible,
and
without
any
distinction
between
public
and
nonpublic
schools.
since
1904--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
the
amount
of
money,
according
to
the
answers
of
the
defendant-intervenors
here,
it
would
seem
that
perhaps
8-9
percent
of
the
money
that
they've
been
receiving
from
the
state
under
this
act
is
for
their
activity
in
connection
with
the
regents
examination.
the--preparing
for
the
examinations,
they
are
given
in
20
different
subjects.
they
are
all
wholly
non--wholly
objective,
except
that
there
are
some
essay
questions
in
english
and
in
social
studies.
the
questions
are
graded
below,
as
i
say,
since
1904,
and
reviewed
in
albany.
they
now
review
just
a
5
percent
sample
of
all
of
the
questions,
but
whether
they
come
from
a
nonpublic
school
or
a
public
school
makes
no
difference;
the
same
professional
unit
reviews
these.
and
for
the
essay
questions,
elaborate
rating
guides
are
provided,
giving
many
sample
answers,
and
indicating
how
they
should
be
handled.
and
in
fact,
the
head
of
the
unit
that
does
this
says
they
really
have
no
idea
when
they're
responding
to
the
questions,
when
they're
marking
them,
reviewing
them,
whether
the
questions
have
been
prepared
by
a
nonpublic
or
public
school
student.
they
have
not
detected
any
difference.
in
any
event,
this
certainly
would
not
be
a
primary
effect.
now,
the
question
that's
been
raised
here
about
diverting
some
of
the
money
to
religious
uses,
because
perhaps
there
would
be
inaccurate
records
has
been
answered
in
part
by
my
saying
that
it's
well
known
in
the
state
education
department
just
how
much
time
should
be
spent
on
taking
attendance,
and
they
can
multiply.
in
the
case
of
the
tests,
they
have
computer
printouts
which
indicate
just
at
what
schools
which
tests
have
been
given,
to
which
they
advert
in
making
their
audit.
and
they
also
have
parameters
by
which
they're
guided.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
the
regents
examinations,
which
are
a
three-hour
exam,
they
have
been
allowing
about
four
hours
for
the
preparing
and
even
the
grading
of
the
regents
exam.
if
these
parameters
seem
to
you
rather
tight,
i
might
mention
that
the
state
comptroller's
office
had
had
a
hand
in
approving
them;
and
in
fact,
every
application
which
has
been
audited
and
approved
for
payment
by
the
state
education
department
also
must
go
to
the
state
comptroller's
office
for
a
pre-audit
before
the
payment
is
made.
the
conclusion
of
our
argument
is
that
there
certainly
is
no
breach
here
in
the
neutrality
that
the
state
is
to
maintain.
it
has
historically
required
the
taking
of
attendance
of
giving
of
regents
examinations,
and
certain
other
standardized
tests.
and
it
obviously
is
in
need
of
the
essential
census
data
that
it
receives
every
year.
all
of
this
is
very
readily
auditable,
and
we
believe
that
we
have
carefully
framed
a
statute
in
response
to
the
injunctions
of
this
court
in
the
directions
that
it
gave
involving
the
mandated
services
act,
which
is
known
as
levitt
i,
and
consequently
the
decision
below
is
correct.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
i
just
passed
over
it,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
our
position
could
and
should
have
been
sustained
under
meek.
the
clarification
of
the
court's
position
in
wolman
has
been
helpful.
the
court,
in
wolman,
has
in
so
many
words
expressly
sanctioned
the
giving
of
standardized
tests
and
the
providing
of
scoring
services.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
in
meek?
what
were
involved
were
the
giving
of
instructional
materials
that
were
used
as
part
of
a
teaching
course.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
as
a
supplement
to
the
course.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
and
therefore,
they
were
part
of
the
teaching
process
in
the
very
real
sense
of
the
word.
and
also,
in
meek,
there
were
auxilliary
services,
which
involved
putting
remedial
teachers,
who
were
public
employees,
right
into
the
schools.
and
it
was
felt
that
because
of
the
pervasive
religious
environment
of
those
schools
that
it
would
require
a
great
deal
of
surveillance
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
infected
by
the
environment.
and
it
was
impossible
to
disentangle
this
from
the
rest.
now,
this
was
all
made
clear
in
wolman,
and
i
don't
find
that
that
was
really
inconsistent
with
meek,
myself.
and
in
our
case,
we
just
don't
come
near
to
abridging
any
of
the
adjudications
that
were
made
in
either
of
those.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
it's
a
matter
of
the
language.
we
think
the
reasoning
is
fine,
but
i
don't--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes,
should
have
reasoned
that
way
the
first
time,
and
also,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
issue
has
been
clarified
by
wolman,
that's
quite
correct.
but
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
that
was
an
inconsistent
ruling;
did
not
really
hold
differently.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
well,
i'm
telling
you
that
i
think
it
was
a
helpful
clarification
of
a
position
of
the
court.
thank
you.
