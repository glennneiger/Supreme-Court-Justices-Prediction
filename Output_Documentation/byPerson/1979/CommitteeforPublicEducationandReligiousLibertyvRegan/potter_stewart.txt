how
can
five
justices
dissent?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
the
district
court
seems
to
have
believed,
in
reversing
its
original
decision,
that
this
court
kind
of
relaxed
the
rules,
or
changed
the
criteria
somewhat,
in
wolman,
as
against
meek
v.
pittenger.
you
haven't
discussed
that.
that
point
was
relied
upon
a
good
deal
by--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
involved
in
meek,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
embrace
all
of
the
reasoning,
or
at
least,
all
the
language,
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
thought--you
submit
that
it
should
have
reasoned
that
way
the
first
time.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
nolan,
why
is
horace
mann-barnard
school
here
at
all,
when
the
plaintiffs,
through
mr.
pfeffer,
concede
the
validity
of
the
application
of
the
state
law
to
a
school--to
that
school
and
schools
like
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
non--non-religious?
justice
potter
stewart
concededly
so,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
just
here
as
a
historic
vestige?
