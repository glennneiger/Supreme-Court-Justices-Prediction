mr.
attorney
general,
what
was
the
reason
for
closing
the
trial
--
the
factual
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
this
have
been
prevented?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
have
the
same
jury
each
time,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
statute,
didn't
he?
he
relied
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
ruled
on
the
statute,
he
built
an
opinion
on
the
statute,
that
order
was
appealed,
and
you
say
the
statute
is
not
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
they
say
the
judge
should
be
reversed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
it
aimed
at
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
was
in
the
order.
they
didn't
mention
the
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
saying
the
statute
wasn't
mentioned
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
saying
it
wasn't
argued
or
mentioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
supreme
court
nobody
mentioned
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
language.
was
it
mentioned
parenthetically
by
anybody
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
anybody
else
mention
it
parenthetically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
commonwealth
attorney
and
the
appellant
did
not?
they
didn't
even
refer
to
it
tangentially,
in
passing
--
listen
to
me,
please.
they
never
mentioned
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
appellants.
justice
thurgood
marshall
never
mentioned
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
defendant
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
he
was
acquitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
the
state's
position
that
nobody
has
any
right
there
but
the
defendant
and
he
was
acquitted,
so
that's
the
end
of
the
ballgame.
