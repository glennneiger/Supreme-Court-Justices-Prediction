justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
court
had
to
decide.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
automatically
closed,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
defendant
asks
that
it
be
closed,
and
the
prosecutor
doesn't
object.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
mr.
tribe,
you
would
agree
i
suppose
that
the
statute
did
authorize
a
trial
judge
in
this
case
to
do
precisely
what
he
did?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
your
claim
is
that
the
statute,
at
least
as
applied
in
this
case,
is
--
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
it's
not
clear
to
me
in
what
you're
now
telling
us
just
what
provision
of
the
constitution
it
violates
as
applied
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sixth
amendment
was
--
claim
was
disposed
of
in
the
gannett
case,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sixth
amendment
talks
about
in
all
criminal
prosecutions.
justice
potter
stewart
insofar
as
there
was
reliance
by
the
petitioners
--
or
the
appellants,
whoever
they
were--in
the
gannett
case,
the
sixth
amendment
claim
was
disposed
of.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sixth
amendment
by
its
own
terms
talks
about
all
criminal
prosecution;
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
was
reliance
in
the
gannett
case
on
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
argument
was
rejected.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sixth
amendment
talks
about
all
criminal
prosecutions.
and
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
sixth
amendment
confers
certain
rights
upon
the
accused.
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial;
and
the
right
to
a
public
trial
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
the
accused.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
therefore,
as
the
gannett
case
i
thought
said,
just
--
that
the
sixth
amendment
self-evidently
applies
only
to
criminal
cases,
and
confers
rights
only
upon
the
accused.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
opinion
might
have
been
a
good
deal
shorter
had
there
not
been
a
dissenting
opinion,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
are
your
clients
the
general
public,
or
are
they
members
of
the
press?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
not
the
general
public
they're
specific
members
of
the
press,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
so
are
you,
so
am
i.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
might
not
have
the
same
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
you
distressed
about
the
first
amendment,
which
gives
separate
and
specific
protection
to
the
press?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
there
in
the
first
amendment,
whether
we
like
it
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
that,
too,
was
held
in
gannett,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
you
talk
about
the
first
amendment,
mr.
tribe.
but
i
don't
suppose
it's
just
a
crowbar.
is
there
some
--
could
there
be
some
showing
that
would
permit
the
closing
or
not?
under
your
first
amendment
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
true
about
a
jury
trial,
isn't
it?
do
you
think
that
the
public
or
the
--
has
any
right
at
all
to
insist
upon
a
jury
trial?
although
that's
certainly
a
fundamental
postulate
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
our
country.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
defendant
waives
it,
and
the
prosecutor
agrees.
justice
potter
stewart
which
members
of
the
press
might
like
to
do
so
some
times.
justice
potter
stewart
attorney
general
coleman,
what
arguments
were
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
only
federal
constitutional
arguments?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
maybe
state
law
arguments
might
have
been
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
this
long
tradition
you
have
told
us
about
in
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
were
oral
constitutional
arguments
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
justice
potter
stewart
only
those
arguments
and
no
state
common
law
arguments?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
i
am
just
trying
to
get
it
--
suggestions
to
the
answer
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
but
no
state
constitutional
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
or
state
common
law?
justice
potter
stewart
he
relied
on
it
and
said
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
do
you
suppose
the
statute
means
when
it
talks
about
the
right
of
the
accused
to
a
public
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
not
a
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
just
answered
my
question
that
there
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
criminal
or
civil
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
reason
you
say
the
first
amendment
provides
an
appropriate
home
for
that
concept
is
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
such
cases
as
saxby.
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
somebody
has
a
right
to
open
up
these
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
to
that
extent
that
you
look
to
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
limits
--
justice
potter
stewart
saxby,
pell
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
between
the
president
and
members
of
his
cabinet,
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
said
that
the
prosecutor
represents
the
public
interest,
and
he
consents.
what
would
be
the
constitutional
source
of
the
public
interest
that
he
represents?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
by
definition
the
public
trial
provisions
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
for
the
defendant's
protection,
and
yet
the
prosecutor
can
open
it
up.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that
argument
would
apply
to
both
civil
and
criminal
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
tradition
is
the
same.
