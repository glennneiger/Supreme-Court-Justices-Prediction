justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
it
wasn't
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
you
into
too
much
trouble,
but
what
about
gannett?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
was
close?
do
you
think
it
was
close?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tribe,
i
suppose
there
might
be
a
legitimate
or
at
least
arguable,
colorable
first
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
by
contrast
to
a
defendant
who
just
gets
up
there
and
says
one
sentence,
"i
plead
guilty,
your
honor"
and
that
deprives
the
press
and
the
public
of
all
the
information
about
all
the
otherwise
available
evidence
about
those
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
criminal
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
to
go
further
but
i
wouldn't
go
with
you
that
there
is
no
colorable
first
amendment
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
judge
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
said,
"this
is
just
one
of
those
cases
i
think
would
be
tried
better
without
the
public
here
or
the
press.
i
am
closing
the
courtroom.
do
you
have
any
objection,
mr.
defendant?
it's
immaterial
to
us."
and
the
press
and
the
public
then
want
a
hearing,
and
say,
"we
certainly
have
the
right
to
sit
in
here.
certainly
the
defendant
doesn't
want
to
keep
us
out;
it
is
you,
judge?"
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
you
couldn't
find
any
constitutional
provision
that
they
would
be
relying
on
to
get
them
in
the
courtroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
judge,
even
over
the
defendant's
objection
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wait
a
minute.
if
the
judge,
even
over
the
defendant's
objection,
closes
the
trial,
the
only
person
who
has
standing
to
raise
any
constitutional
argument
is
the
defendant
--
not
the
public,
not
the
press,
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
on
what
constitutional
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
i
know,
but
i
want
to
know
is
he
the
only
one
who
can
object
--
who
has
a
constitutional
ground
for
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
first
amendment
is
irrelevant
to
my
question
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
richmond
newspapers
rely
on
any
provision
of
the
state
constitution
to
invalidate
this
statute
and
this
closure?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
similar
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
require
a
public
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
claim
that
under
virginia's
constitution
this
closure
was
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
reliance
on
the
public
trial
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
virginia
law
is
like
gannett
--
that
public
trial
provision
is
available
only
to
the
accused?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tribe,
before
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
a
question?
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
saxby
and
hutchins
are
not
controlling
because
those
cases
did
not
involve
a
situation
in
which
there
was
the
right
on
behalf
of
someone
to
have
the
proceedings
opened
up.
here
is
the
sixth
amendment
right
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
to
open
them
up,
and
that
is
what
distinguishes
those
cases.
but
is
there
not,
did
we
not
decide
earlier
or
agree
earlier,
that
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
right
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
open
up
the
pretrial
proceeding?
if
that
is
the
case,
and
if
your
theory
is
correct,
your
theory
requires
us
to
overrule
gannett,
is
that
right?
if
your
thrust
is
right,
compelling
necessity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
test
is,
if
i
understand
you
right,
the
rule
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
access
applies
and
that
right
can
only
be
rejected
on
a
showing
of
compelling
need.
there
was
no
showing
of
compelling
need
in
gannett,
as
i
understand
it.
there
was
just
a
showing
of
sufficient
basis
for
closing
it
up.
