mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court.
your
honor,
the
appellants
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
the
bill
of
rights
is
for
the
public,
but
i
think
their
argument
ignores
the
one
person
at
whom
most
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
aimed,
john
paul
stevenson.
now,
there
are
two
broad
claims
that
can
be
made.
one
is
the
trial
court
could
never
be
closed
and
the
other
is
the
trial
courts
can
be
closed
without
a
hearing
and
without
a
hearing
or
without
any
reason
or
opportunity
for
the
public
to
protest
and
argue
against
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
that
the
second
argument
is
never
reached
because
this
is
the
first
case,
in
my
knowledge
in
virginia,
where
a
criminal
proceeding
has
been
closed
in
the
guise
of
a
full
trial.
there
is
a
tradition
that
exists
that
is
inviolate
and
as
long
as
i
am
attorney
general
i
am
sure
it
will
be
continued
that
the
judge
in
this
case
was
concerned
and
confronted
with
several
difficulties.
here
were
very
unusual
and
narrow
facts.
someone
who
had
been
tried
four
times.
on
the
first
occasion,
the
trial
had
gone
up
to
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
and
because
a
bloody
shirt
had
been
introduced
on
the
basis
of
hearsay
evidence,
the
case
was
sent
back
for
retrial.
there
was
a
second,
subsequent
mistrial
because
one
of
the
jurors
became
sick.
there
was
a
third
mistrial
because
the
jury
was
poisoned
by
finding
out
about
prejudicial
information
that
should
not
come
forward.
and
then,
in
this
fourth
occasion,
the
judge
was
confronted
with
the
defense
attorney,
with
the
agreement
of
the
prosecutor,
asking
that
trial
be
closed
so
his
rights
could
be
protected.
now,
if
difficulties
had
occurred
in
this
trial
and
if
the
motion
had
not
been
granted,
certainly,
difficulties
could
have
come
to
this
court.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
factual
reasons
were,
first
of
all
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
yes,
they
are.
they
was
a
hearing
that
was
conducted
that
was
asked
for
after
the
disclosure
was
made.
and
that
was
made
after
the
trial
on
the
first
day
had
been
concluded
and
the
jury
had
been
sent
home.
the
defense
attorney
and
the
judge
were
concerned
about
the
fact
that
on
one
occasion
this
prejudicial
information
had
come
to
the
jury
and
had
kept
them
from
trying
the
case.
they
had
to
try
another
case.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
at
the
time
this
hearing
was
requested
and
these
points
were
urged,
sequestration
and
change
of
venue,
the
jury
had
already
gone
home
that
day,
the
trial
had
begun.
it
is
obvious
that
sequestration
is
a
possibility
in
any
case
like
this
that
is
used.
but,
in
this
case,
they
had
had
four
trials.
they
had
had
some
concern
about
someone
in
the
jury,
in
the
gallery
or
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
we
didn't
but
someone
who
was
in
every
one
of
the
trials,
apparently,
was
in
the
courtroom.
and
the
jury
had
to,
on
each
occasion,
go
out
in
front
of
the
gallery
where
the
public
was
and
apparently
the
record
is
not
completely
clear
on
this,
i
think
because
these
people
tried
the
case
so
many
times,
it
was
kind
of
shorthand,
they
were
concerned
about
members
of
the
public
having
some
conversation
back
and
forth
with
the
jury.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
concede
that.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
that
is
true,
but
what
we
are
confronted
with
now
is
looking
back
on
a
judge
who
is
on
the
firing
line,
that
had
all
of
these
factors
and,
on
the
request
of
the
defendant,
decided
to
close
the
trial.
he
granted
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
when
it
was
made
later
that
afternoon.
and
these
parties
that
are
in
this
case
today
were
in
court
that
morning
and
made
no
objection
to
closure.
they
came
back
later
that
afternoon
and
read
from
some
briefs
and
presented
some
oral
argument
and
then
said,
"but
we
don't
know",
through
counsel,
"the
reason
why
this
case
was
closed."
and
then,
when
the
reasons
were
explained,
there
was
no
response
to
that.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
the
law
is
that
if
a
prosecutor
and
if
defense
attorney
and
the
defendant
and
the
judge,
two
of
whom
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
representing
the
public
interest,
say
they
want
the
trial
closed
--
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
or
any
law
shows
that
that
can
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
when
the
three
agree,
when
the
public
interest
is
represented,
and
i
think
the
basis
of
many
decisions
in
this
court
is
that
the
public
interest
is
represented
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge,
that
historically
you
cannot
blend
the
sixth
and
first
amendments
together.
the
sixth
amendment
i
think
arose
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
think
i
can
certainly
see
that
if
abuses
occur
in
which
there
was
case
after
case
after
case
of
closed
trial
it
might
be
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
will
not
concede
that
the
first
amendment
would.
that
would
be
the
obvious
one
that
would
be
advanced.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that
has
been
decided,
i
think.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
public
trials,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
think
it's
a
constitutional
interest.
i
don't
think
it
has
been
exalted
to
that
standing.
i
think
the
tradition
of
this
court
has
been
on
many
occasions
not
to
lay
down
a
broad
constitutional
rule
in
a
case
until
there
is
some
experience
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
problem
and
an
evil
that
needs
to
be
attacked
by
such
a
rule.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
is
one
that
is
personal
to
the
accused.
i
think
the
purpose
for
it
is
to
provide
a
fair
trial.
it
is
a
procedural
guarantee,
and
i
don't
think
that
someone
could
come
in
and
object
to
any
of
these
other
rights
he
had,
should
he
want
to
waive
them,
whether
it
is
a
jury,
a
speedy
trial,
or
a
question
of
having
counsel.
it
doesn't
mean
he
has
a
right
to
demand
one.
i
think
the
court
has
said
that.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
demand
a
private
trial
if
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
don't
agree.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
we
would
certainly
have
no
appeal.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
if
you
opened
the
first
amendment
application
to
the
sixth
amendment
it
becomes
an
unending
proposition.
how
do
you
cut
any
governmental
functioning
or
operation
off
from
the
public's
right
to
observe
it
once
you
enter
into
that
thicket.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
idea
of
a
right
to
know
being
founded
in
the
constitution
is
not
legally
or
historically
correct.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
congress
could
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
the
congress
could
so
long
as
it
did
not
enact
a
law
that
was
at
odds
with
the
procedural
guarantee
provided
for
the
defendants.
i
don't
think
that
the
public
--
that
we
could
throw
to
the
wolves
the
defendant
because
he
has
a
constitutional
protection
by
providing
some
sort
of
right
to
know
or
requirement
of
public
proceedings.
it's
a
common
law
tradition
it's
a
tradition
in
virginia.
it
has
remained
inviolate,
but
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case
you
are
confronted
with
a
very
limited,
narrowly
factually
drawn
case
that
ought
not
be
reversed
because
the
judge
on
the
firing
line
was
making
a
decision.
he
did
not
have
time
to
think
a
year
about
it.
he
had
time
to
think
about
it
only
that
evening
or
in
the
morning
when
it
was
first
made.
now,
the
appellants
didn't
make
a
motion
when
it
could
have
been
effective.
if
the
judge
had
had
this
motion
when
the
order
was
made,
there
would
have
been
some
time
to
consider
whether
there
might
be
more
effective
devices
to
protect
the
right
of
the
defendant
in
the
trial
without
having
a
private
trial.
but
this
was
not
a
case
where
it
was
not
possible
for
the
public
to
know
what
went
on.
tapes
were
available
as
soon
as
the
case
was
over.
it
was
only
a
two-day
trial.
the
defendant
was
acquitted.
those
tapes
were
available.
there
was
never
any
hint
or
suggestion
that
there
was
any
corruption,
that
there
was
anything
untoward,
or
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
cover
up
anything.
i
don't
think,
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
you
can
come
to
any
other
conclusion
but
that
the
judge
was
concerned
about
the
focus
the
bill
of
rights,
which
is
the
protection
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
who
was
on
trial
for
his
fourth
time.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
anything
wrong
with
him
providing
a
hearing.
but
it
strikes
me
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
have
a
problem
with
believing
that
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
expression
argument
transcends
the
political
arena
and
the
dialogue
in
ideas.
i
think
all
of
the
argument
about
a
public
forum
is
mis-directed
here.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
now
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
public
does.
the
prosecutor
is
there.
he
is
elected.
he
is
to
represent
the
public
interest.
i
think
he
could
object
to
it.
and
i
think
if
the
defendant
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
say
it
is
on
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
my
answer
to
that
is
i
think
the
defendant
would
come
back
into
court
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
would
prefer
not
to
be
pushed
on
that,
but
if
you
ask
me
to,
i
certainly
will
oblige
by
saying
i
think
the
first
amendment
talks
about
and
is
historically
concerned
about
the
expression
and
ideas
about
debate.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
it
is.
now,
the
point
in
this
case
is
that
to
craft
a
rule
that
would
presuppose,
as
i
think
the
appellant's
argument
does,
that
judges
must
not
do
their
duty,
that
they
will
not
try
to
abide
by
the
common
law,
the
traditions
in
our
state,
which
have
never
led
to
a
closed
trial
in
the
history
of
virginia
insofar
as
i
know,
is
the
kind
of
proposition
that
will
call
into
question
many,
many
other
rules
of
this
court.
i
think
we
can
assume
that.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
regularity.
and
i
think
in
this
case
when
you
consider
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
told
judges
to
use
strong
measures
to
protect
a
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial,
to
be
over-cautious,
to
prevent
even
the
possibility
of
unfairness,
that
it
was
incumbent
on
the
judge
to
consider
that
motion,
and
he
did
it
in
the
context
of
recognizing
that
more
error
and
more
mistake
in
this
case
could
ultimately
have
the
defendant
coming
back
and
saying,
"my
rights
were
not
protected."
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
things
there.
i
think,
first,
that
if,
when
the
supreme
court,
in
reviewing
what
incidentally
was
not
an
attack
on
the
statute,
and
we
have
made
the
point
in
our
brief
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
appeal
because
that
statute
was
never
even
mentioned
by
the
appellants
in
the
case,
it
was
not
cited
it
was
not
attacked,
we
cannot
say
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
we
cannot
say
whether
the
supreme
court
passed
on
the
statute
or
not.
but
it
strikes
me
that
the
supreme
court
can
be
said
to
have
viewed
this
as
within
the
gannett
exemption
and
that
being
when
the
prosecutor,
the
defense
attorney
and
the
judge
agree
that
it
is
necessary
for
a
fair
trial
and
when
it
is
cast
against
the
publicity,
the
problems
they
had
had
with
mistrials
in
the
past,
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
find
reversible
error.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
they
were
not
prepared
to
say
that
a
common
law
interest
and
a
tradition
in
open
trials
which
has
many
beneficial
effects,
and
this
court
has
agreed
with
that,
when
it
is
in
confrontation
with
the
right
to
have
a
fair
trial,
that
all
parties
of
interest
in
that
case,
representing
the
public
interest,
the
judge
and
the
defendant
felt
was
necessary,
that
the
supreme
court
was
not
going
to
again
say
that.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
maverick
orders
and
decisions
that
depart
from
that
can
be
corrected
by
state
court
rules
or
by
legislation
as
we
have
proposed
in
virginia.
but
i
don't
think
a
constitutional
rule
would
be
inflexibility
that
is
obviously
accompanied
with
laying
that
rule
down
as
something
that
is
needed
here.
it
would
raise
a
whole
host
of
questions.
first
of
all,
if
the
first
amendment
applies,
that
could
be
a
limitless
right
that
would
spill
over
into
many,
many
areas.
and
we
have
had
terrific
problems
with
freedom
of
information
legislation
and
trying
to
close
loopholes
and
to
determine
where
privacy
starts
and
when
the
interest
and
the
right
to
know
begins.
but
a
rule
of
court
or
statutory
law
can
be
changed,
it
can
be
altered
and
the
judgment
of
the
nation
and
the
diversity
of
responses
by
the
states
have
just
not
been
able
to
move
forward
and
occur
in
the
short
time
since
the
gannett
decision
was
handed
down.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
the
statute
itself
was
not
actually
attacked.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
and
the
constitutional
arguments.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
i
am
correct
on
that.
you
are
talking
about
the
other
side?
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
that.
i
didn't
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
no
statutory
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
there
may
be
federal
constitutional
questions.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
think
he
mentioned
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
am
saying
that
the
appellants
never
drew
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
into
question
in
the
trial.
they
did
not
mention
it.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
they
said
that
there
was
an
interest
in
the
public
to
have
the
trial
open
to
the
public.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
if
it
was,
they
didn't
mention
it.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
it
wasn't
in
the
order.
it
was
just
in
the
oral
record
in
which
the
judge
mentioned
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
my
position
is
that
the
question
was
not
ruled
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
it
was
mentioned
by
the
judge.
the
judge
mentioned
the
statute,
but
at
no
time
was
it
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
nowhere
mentioned.
it
was
not
even
mentioned.
now,
we
mentioned
in
our
response,
we
referred
to
the
statute
along
with
other
grounds.
the
other
side
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
state
mentioned
it.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
commonwealth
attorney.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
court?
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
never
mentioned
it.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
the
virginia
constitution
--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
it
doesn't.
but
it
has
a
first
amendment.
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
different
from
saying
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
public
trial.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
there
is
a
right
to
a
public
trial
in
virginia.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
yes,
there
is
a
constitutional.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
there
is.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
there
is.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
yes.
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
trial,
a
public
trial.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
it
was
only
the
federal
rights
that
were
invoked
in
this
case
by
the
appellants.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
no,
we
found
no
virginia
law,
and
it
was
not
raised
in
that
case.
the
matter
that
is
before
the
court
is
a
very
unusual
factual
case,
as
i
have
suggested
to
the
court,
that
involves
a
clear
concern
on
the
part
of
the
judge
about
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
it
is
the
fourth
time
the
case
had
been
tried.
there
were
very
unusual
circumstances
and
when
this
motion
was
made
by
the
appellant
to
open
it,
it
came
late.
it
came
without
the
ability
for
him,
really,
to
take
these
alternative
precautions
that
could
have
been
if
it
had
come
earlier.
and
the
judge,
in
view
of
all
of
that,
felt
that
he
would
go
ahead
and
close
the
trial.
he
certainly
gave
deference
to
any
interest
that
the
public
would
have
in
a
public
trial.
he
certainly
was
concerned
about
the
defendant's
position,
and
he
was
certainly
concerned
about
what
would
happen
in
the
future.
the
fact
is
that
the
case
ended
in
an
acquittal.
the
fact
also
is
that
tapes
were
available
to
the
public
and
to
everyone
else
to
find
out
what
had
happened
in
court,
and
how
it
had
happened.
but
it
is
simply
the
position
of
the
state
that
this
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
that
in
this
case
all
the
considerations
that
could
be
taken
into
account
were
taken
into
account
by
the
court,
and
that
it
does
not
reflect
a
policy
of
not
giving
due
respect
to
the
public
interest
in
a
public
trial.
and
for
that
reason,
we
urge
that
on
the
merits
the
case
should
not
be
reversed,
and
we
would
also
urge
that
from
a
procedural
standpoint,
since
we
do
not
know
what
construction
the
state
supreme
court
would
have
placed
on
this
statute
if
it
had
been
contested
by
the
appellants,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
case
to
come
on
appeal.
we
also
think,
since
the
jurisdictional
question
has
been
reserved
that
the
certiorari
ought
not
to
be
granted
in
this
case
because
there
needs
to
be
sufficient
time
for
the
state
to
respond
to
the
gannett
decision.
