justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
distinction
in
first
amendment
terms.
but
i'm
not
quite
sure,
if
you
followed
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion,
why
you
draw
a
distinction
between
pretrial
and
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
surely,
did
you
rely
--
i
know
you
rely
here,
and
i
assume
you
relied
in
the
virginia
courts,
on
the
first
amendment
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
hope
you
will.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
may
not,
because
you
may
think
you
have
a
good
enough
reason,
but
if
somebody
disagrees
with
you,
you
might
reach
it
and
say
whether,
regardless
of
reason,
you
could
close
the
trial.
do
you
think
there
is
some
constitutional
barrier
to
closing
trials
when
the
three
agree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
you
needed
to
say
at
the
hearing
where
the
press
and
the
people
is
that
three
people
have
agreed
and
we
don't
need
any
reason
to
close
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
what
constitutional
provision
would
be
implicated,
in
your
view,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
think
the
sixth
amendment
would,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
about
what
sounds
to
me
like
a
concession
to
mr.
justice
white
that
where
the
three
agree,
there
is
no
constitutional
provision
--

regarding
the
