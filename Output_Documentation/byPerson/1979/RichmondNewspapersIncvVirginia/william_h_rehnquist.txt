justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
hanover
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
some
--
that's
like,
most
places
are
some
miles
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
appellant
jurisdiction,
whether
the
statute
is
invalid
on
its
face
or
whether
it's
invalid
as
applied,
do
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
enough.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
most
of
the
opinion
was
dictum,
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
a
trial,
mr.
tribe,
i
take
it
you
exclude
side
bar
conferences,
chambers
discussion
as
to
suppression
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
arise
during
trial.
you're
talking
about
reception
of
testimony
from
witnesses
before
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
have
a
defendant
who
waives
the
right
to
a
public
trial
he
wants
a
closed
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
this
one
did.
then
what
happens
to
your
first
amendment
argument?
it's
really
just
a
kind
of
a
tailgate
kind
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
be
the
government's
decision
in
almost
every
case
that
closes
a
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
in
the
public
domain
if
the
defendant
seeks
--
waives
his
right
to
a
public
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant,
if
he
consents,
is
certainly
in
no
position
to
raise
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
particularly
if
he
is
acquitted
by
the
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
attorney
general
coleman,
if
you
are
right
that
there
has
been
such
a
long
tradition
of
open
trials
in
your
state,
and
that
the
trial
judge,
as
you
say,
was
on
the
firing
line,
had
to
make
a
quick
decision,
how
do
you
account
for
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
giving
such
short
shrift
to
the
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
in
the
briefs
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
all,
the
cite
of
gannett
v.
depasquale
as
i
would
read
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
settles
the
federal
constitutional
question,
but
if
the
state
has
this
long
tradition
of
open
trials,
is
there
any
other
reason
that
you
know
of
why
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
didn't
perhaps
write
a
little
more
on
the
subject?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
the
attorney
general
said
the
maverick
decision
can
be
corrected
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
not
that
this
was
a
maverick
decision.
