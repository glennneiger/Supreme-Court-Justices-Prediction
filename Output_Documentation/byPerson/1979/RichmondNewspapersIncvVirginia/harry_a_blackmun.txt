justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
tribe,
may
i
just
pursue
this
thought
for
a
little
bit
further
on.
the
sixth
amendment
issue
only
--
and
you
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
pretrial
and
trial
--
is
there
any
suggestion
in
any
of
our
cases
that
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing
should
be
closed
over
the
objection
of
the
accused?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
suggest
that
we
would
so
hold,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
one
word
in
the
majority
opinion
lends
support
to
that
notion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
a
single
word.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
why
did
the
judge
need
any
reason
to
close
the
trial?
i
am
talking
about
constitutional
reasons.
i
am
not
talking
about
virginia
law
or
any
traditions
of
yours.
did
you
think
there
was
some
constitutional
reason
suggesting
why
you
shouldn't
close
the
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
as
long
as
the
three
agree,
the
defendant,
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge,
you
would
close
any
criminal
trial
without
any
reason
whatsoever
insofar
as
the
constitution
is
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
--
your
basic
position,
i
gather,
is
you
don't
need
any
reason.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
may
be
so,
but
what
about
--
is
there
a
constitutional
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
a
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
public
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
was
that
provision
invoked
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
any
prior
virginia
cases
that
deal
with
the
right
to
public
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
also
not
prevail
by
applying
a
different
standard
than
compelling
need.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
right.
