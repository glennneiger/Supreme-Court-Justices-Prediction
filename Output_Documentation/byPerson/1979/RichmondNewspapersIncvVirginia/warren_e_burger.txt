chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
richmond
newspapers,
incorporated,
against
virginia.
mr.
tribe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
trial
held
in
the
same
courtroom
as
the
prior
trials?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
to
the
matter
of
breadth,
mr.
tribe,
tell
me
whether
i
correctly
gathered
from
what
you
said
before,
that
you're
not
arguing
that
never
under
any
circumstances
or
conditions
can
a
part
of
a
trial
be
closed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can
you
imagine
circumstances
in
which
a
total
public
audience
of
40
can
be
seated
and
a
hundred
others
want
to
get
in,
but
they
would
have
to
stand
around
the
edges.
and
the
trial
judge
says,
"those
who
can
be
seated,
be
seated
be
seated.
but
we're
not
going
to
have
standing."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
burden
is
heavier
on
the
trial
than
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
word.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tribe,
if
you
had
a
professor
at
the
law
school
nearby
who
wanted
to
come
to
listen
so
that
he
could
lecture
on
the
subject
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
not
this
one,
the
hanover
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
he
then
have
a
nexus
with
the
first
amendment
rights
about
speech,
if
he
was
going
to
make
this
lecture,
based
on
what
he
observed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
just
pursuing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
just
pursuing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
was
suggested,
is
there
any
difference
to
whether
the
man's
going
to
use
the
information
to
write
something
or
to
go
out
and
make
a
speech
about
it2?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he's
just
going
to
maintain
silence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
know
--
have
we
any
way
of
knowing
very
much
about
the
closeness
of
it
in
the
absence
of
any
findings
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
couldn't
the
judge
handle
that
by
simply
saying
that
all
spectators
must
remain
in
their
seats
while
the
jury
departs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
jury
is
to
remain
in
the
box
until
all
the
spectators
are
gone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
court
decided
that
this
hearing
today
was
to
be
closed,
no
one
except
counsel
and
the
court
and
the
necessary
attendants
be
present,
and
that
was
with
the
consent
of
both
of
you
gentlemen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
queno,
i
agree
with
you.
but
what
about
--
i
hadn't
quite
finished
my
question.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
explicitly
would
prevent
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can't
point
to
any.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
could,
if
that
step
had
been
taken
by
this
court
or
any
appellate
court,
congress
could
provide
a
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
say
it
must
be
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
two
moments
left,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
sit
down,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
did
the
court
draw
on
to
make
a
presumption
of
innocence
part
of
our
fabric?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
not
also
some
hints
that
this
was
the
tradition
in
1787,
'89,
'90
and
'91.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
