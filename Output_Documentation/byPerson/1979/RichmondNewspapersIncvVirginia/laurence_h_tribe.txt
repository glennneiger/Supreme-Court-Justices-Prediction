mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
richmond
newspapers,
and
two
of
its
reporters,
who
were
expelled,
along
with
all
other
members
of
the
public,
from
an
entire
murder
trial
in
september
of
1978.
it
was
the
fourth
time
that
the
defendant
had
been
brought
to
trial
for
the
murder
of
a
local
hotel
manager.
and
his
case
had
already
been
extensively
described
in
the
local
press.
on
motion
of
defense
counsel,
without
objections
by
the
prosecutor,
the
trial
judge
closed
the
entire
trial
on
the
authority
of
a
virginia
statute
which
gives
trial
courts
discretion
to
treat
all
observers
as,
and
i
quote
the
language
of
the
statute,
persons
whose
presence
would
impair
the
conduct
of
a
fair
trial.
at
the
end
of
a
two-day
secret
trial,
the
trial
judge
excused
the
jury,
declared
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
murder,
and
set
him
free.
on
petitions
for
appeal
--
mandamus
and
prohibition
--
appellants
sought
to
prevent
their
recurring
exclusion
from
complete
criminal
trials
by
urging
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
hold
such
closure
unconstitutional.
the
state,
in
a
memorandum
and
a
brief,
defended
the
closure
on
the
express
authority
of
the
virginia
statute
that
had
been
invoked
by
the
trial
judge.
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
summarily
upheld
the
closure,
citing
only
this
court's
one-week-old
decision
in
gannett.
although
the
virginia
statute
and
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
speak
in
terms
of
fair
trial
in
this
case,
there
was
no
specific
risk
of
unfairness
whatever,
either
demonstrated
or
found
below.
the
problems
that
were
noted,
either
by
defense
counsel
or
by
the
trial
court,
were
three
types.
first,
there
were
suggestions,
which
appellants
submit
are
incompatible
with
the
concept
of
public
trial.
for
example,
the
trial
judge's
comment
that
the
courtroom
layout
might
make
observers
distracting
since
jurors
could
see
them
a
courtroom
which
for
some
two
and
one-half
centuries
had
been
used
for
open
criminal
trials.
second,
there
were
suggested
difficulties
that
closing
the
trial
simply
could
not
have
solved.
i
have
in
mind
here
defense
counsel's
concern
that
one
or
more
of
the
prior
trials
had
in
some
way
been
spoiled
by
inadmissible
evidence,
or
by
jury
exposure
to
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
was,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
held
under
the
same
judge
as
the
second
and
third
trials,
but
a
different
judge
than
the
one
who
presided
over
the
first.
it
was
only
the
first
trial
that
went
to
judgment,
a
judgment
of
conviction
that
was
ultimately
reversed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
some
miles
from
richmond,
and
it's
a
rural
county.
one
of
the
points,
indeed,
made
by
the
attorney
general
is
that
because
it's
a
small
community
problems
of
prejudicial
publicity
might
be
greater.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
afraid
i
have
not
been
in
hanover
county,
mr.
justice.
finally,
there
were
suggestions
of
problems
that
could
obviously
have
been
solved
by
devices
that
were
far
less
restrictive
than
closure.
defense
counsel
expressed
particular
fear
that
jurors
might
receive
misleading
or
prejudicial
information
of
some
kind
between
trial
sessions.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
jurors
could
not
possibly
be
insulated
during
a
trial,
especially
of
this
brief
duration,
from
persons
who
might
give
them
prejudicial
or
misleading
information.
now,
if
this
record
justifies
the
closure
of
an
entire
murder
trial,
then
frankly,
it's
rather
hard
to
imagine
one
that
would
not.
the
basic
question
that
is
therefore
presented
is,
whether
complete
criminal
trials
can
be
held
in
secret,
simply
because
defense
counsel
has
moved
for
closure,
and
the
prosecution
has
not
objected.
that
is
what
the
statute
in
this
case
authorized.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
in
the
court's
discretion,
that's
right.
and
the
question
is
whether
that
discretion
can
be
conferred
upon
a
trial
court
to
close
the
trial
simply
for
that
reason,
on
a
record
like
this
which
shows
no
special
risk
of
unfairness.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
what
questions
are
not
involved
here
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
not
automatically
closed,
mr.
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no
the
trial
judge
still
has
discretion
to
decide.
but
indeed,
when
we
move
to
the
first
amendment,
i
think
that
will
be
an
important
part
of
the
argument.
but
it
is
a
discretionary
decision
by
an
agent
of
government
whether
there
shall
or
shall
not
be
public
awareness
of
what
goes
on
in
this
trial.
the
question,
then,
is
whether
the
whole
trial
can
be
closed
not
whether
disorderly
observers
can
be
expelled
not
whether
witnesses
can
be
asked
to
leave
while
other
witnesses
are
testifying
not
whether
a
particular
portion
of
the
trial
can
be
closed
not
whether
certain
members
of
the
public
can
be
excluded.
the
question
is
really
a
rather
wholesale
one,
and
it's
in
that
posture
that
the
case
reaches
this
court.
now,
because
the
court
postponed
consideration
of
jurisdiction
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
i
want
to
begin
by
addressing
this
question
of
whether
this
case
is
properly
here
under
1257(2).
as
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
the
blackbird
creek
case
in
1829,
it
might
have
been
safer,
it
might
have
avoided
any
question
respecting
jurisdiction,
to
have
stated
in
terms
that
the
act
was
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
surely
it
would
have
been
safer
here
not
to
have
omitted
that
statement.
it
is
true
that
the
appellants
below
never
said,
in
so
many
words,
this
statute
violates
the
constitution.
but
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
statute
was
drawn
in
question,
and
whether
the
decision
was
in
favor
of
its
validity.
and
we
submit
that
the
answer,
to
both
of
those
questions
is
yes.
the
trial
court
cited
only
this
statute
as
authority.
the
court
said
the
statute
specifically
authorizes
the
closure
of
a
trial.
so
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
merely
a
general
authorizing
statute,
like
one
conferring
jurisdiction
to
regulate,
or
jurisdiction
to
tax,
which
is
somehow
gratuitously
dragged
in
by
hindsight.
this
is
a
case
where
the
statute
by
its
terms
bears
the
infirmity
that
concerns
us
here.
nor
did
the
state
claim
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
the
action
of
the
trial
court
was
somehow
a
lawless
aberration.
in
the
court
below,
as
in
this
court,
the
state
says
that
the
closure
was
lawful.
and
indeed,
in
the
virginia
supreme
court,
in
defending
its
legality,
both
the
prosecution's
brief
opposing
appeal
and
the
attorney
general's
memorandum,
opposing
mandamus
and
prohibition,
defended
the
legality
of
closure
under
state
law
solely
as
an
exercise
of
authority
which
was
literally
conferred
by
the
statute.
it
defended
the
statute
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
in
this
case,
invalidity
as
construed
and
as
enforced,
is
all
that
we
claim,
mr.
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
certainly
enough.
and
we're
not
claiming
that
every
possible
interpretation
or
application
would
be
void.
but
the
statute
was
defended
in
the
trial
--
in
the
court
below
as
construing,
broadly
enough
to
uphold
this
closure,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
needed
limit
to
the
quote
public's
right
to
know,
unquote.
and
even
in
this
court,
the
attorney
general
is
not,
as
we
understand
it,
disavowing
this
broad
reading
of
the
statute,
or
his
defense
of
its
constitutional
validity
when
read
this
broadly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice;
a
part
of
a
trial.
we
are
arguing
that
at
least
thus
far
we
have
been
unable
to
imagine
any
circumstances
in
which
an
entire
criminal
trial
can
be
closed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly,
mr.
justice.
indeed,
one
of
the
earliest
proceedings
in
this
courtroom,
one
in
which
patrick
henry
delivered
an
impassioned
plea
against
the
tyranny
of
the
king,
was
rather
of
that
kind.
there
wasn't
room
for
all
the
people
who
wanted
to
attend
some
were
asked
to
leave.
but
those
who
could
be
seated,
and
could
remain
orderly,
were
allowed
to
remain.
in
this
case,
however
orderly
the
observers,
all
were
told
to
leave.
the
suggestion,
as
i
gather
it,
by
the
attorney
general
is,
it
would
have
been
nice
if
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
narrow
the
statute
down
somehow,
and
that
it
would
have
been
given
a
better
opportunity
to
do
that,
had
we
brought
it
into
question
instead
of
them.
but
it's
i
think
inconceivable
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference.
no
particular
narrow
reading
was
suggested
by
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general's
position
is
this
statute
authorized
this
closure.
and
it
would
have
been
a
rather
pointless
act
for
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
say
this
closure
was
okay,
but
the
statute
is
not
broad
enough
to
sustain
it.
we
sustain
it
under
some
other
kind
of
common
law
authority.
that
would
have
made
enactment
of
the
statute
a
pointless
legislative
exercise
on
the
part
of
the
virginia
legislature.
so
nothing
really
could
have
turned
in
this
case
on
the
form
in
which
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
read.
it
was
necessarily,
therefore,
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
when
the
court
denied
appeal,
mandamus
and
prohibition.
and
even
with
that
not
true,
the
case
would
clearly
be
here
on
certiorari.
so
let
me
then
turn
to
the
merits.
the
virginia
supreme
court
upheld
this
trial
closure
and
denied
relief
against
recurring
trial
closures,
citing
only
this
court's
decision
in
gannett.
i
must
say,
that
seems
a
baffling
conclusion.
because
of
course
gannett
involved
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing.
no
amount
of
dictum
about
trials
would
have
permitted
the
decision
in
gannett
to
resolve
an
issue
that
was
not
before
this
court.
the
majority
opinion
twice
described
the
question
presented
as
one
about
pretrial
suppression
proceedings
only.
and
the
concluding
statement
of
the
holding
was
equally
narrow.
as
the
chief
justice
obeyed
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
made
all
the
difference.
and
the
reason
that
i
would
submit
it
must
make
a
very
great
deal
of
difference
is,
implicit
in
the
purposes
and
the
character
and
the
available
alternatives
in
the
two
different
settings.
ultimately,
the
purposes
of
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing
are
to
keep
inadmissible
information
from
the
jury,
as
a
cross-section
of
the
public.
in
contrast,
the
purpose
of
the
trial
itself
is
to
expose
admissible
information
to
the
jury
as
a
cross-section
of
the
public.
as
a
result,
the
character
of
the
pre-trial
proceeding
is
almost
that
of
an
internal
governmental
mechanism,
whereas
the
character
of
the
trial
in
chief
is
the
very
opposite.
finally,
there
are
difficulties,
inescapably,
about,
minimizing
prejudice
arising
out
of
the
airing
of
potentially
inadmissible
information
at
a
pretrial
hearing.
there
are
devices
available
and
this
court
has
spoken
of
them
in
many
cases.
sequestration
is
not
available
because
the
jury
isn't
chosen
yet.
but
there
are
devices
available
changing
venue;
screening
jurors
through
questioning.
but
the
difficulty
is
that
they
are
of
uncertain
efficacy,
and
if
one
must
err
on
the
side
of
fair
trial,
it
seems
to
follow
for
some
that
the
public
may
be
excluded
as
a
mechanism.
but
the
tension
between
publicity
and
fairness
ceases
when
the
trial
begins.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
gannett
opinion,
a
panoply
of
devices
is
then
available,
including
sequestering
the
jury,
in
order
to
avoid
any
form
of
prejudicial
information
from
reaching
the
jury.
so
that
all
of
the
general
references
to
the
central
role
of
fairness
in
our
system
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
i
submit,
are
beside
the
point.
we're
devoted
to
fair
trial.
but
fair
trial
does
not
require
closed
trial,
given
the
devices
that
are
available.
now,
even
if
there
were
no
sharp
dichotomies,
no
basic
distinction
between
pretrial
suppression
hearings
on
the
one
hand
and
the
trial
on
the
other
even
if
one
viewed
them
all
as
part
of
the
same
proceeding,
i
think
it's
also
striking
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
this
court
in
gannett
agreed,
though
on
differing
theories,
agreed
at
least
that
there
must
be
a
substantial
showing
of
need
before
either
a
trial
or
a
pretrial
proceeding
can
be
closed.
and
on
this
record
there
was
no
substantial
showing
of
need.
so
without
even
drawing
a
distinction
between
pretrial
suppression
hearings
and
trials
in
chief,
this
court
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
should
think
it
would
be
very
much
heavier,
mr.
chief
justice.
because
at
trial,
presumptively,
the
purpose
is
public;
the
mechanisms
are
available;
the
tradition
is
more
clearly
fixed.
there's
really
no
reason
to
extend
the
reasoning
about
pretrial.
but
even
if
one
did,
i
think
the
conclusion
would
be
the
same
this
kind
of
closure
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
we
think
he
probably
did.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
that
it
violates
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
sixth
amendment
claim
as
to
pretrial
proceedings,
mr.
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
the
accused
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
not
yet
been
held
applicable
at
all
by
this
court
to
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
it
does.
but
i
don't
think
the
question
of
whether
in
the
trial
phase
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
persons
other
than
the
accused
may
have
standing
to
invoke
the
sixth
amendment,
was
disposed
of
in
gannett.
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
that
question
was
definitively
resolved
in
gannett
is
twofold
first,
inasmuch
as
this
court
has
not
yet
held
that
even
the
accused
has
a
right,
before
the
criminal
prosecution
begins,
to
insist
upon
publicity.
the
question
of
whether
the
prosecution
is
deemed
to
have
begun
at
the
pretrial
suppression
hearing
stage,
for
this
purpose,
really
hasn't
been
resolved.
so
perhaps
all
that's
been
held
in
that
respect
is
that
where
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
apply
at
all,
it
doesn't
confer
rights
on
the
public.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
afraid
a
good
bit
of
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as
to
pretrial
suppression
hearings.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
as
to
the
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
justice,
you
are
surely
the
authority
on
what
gannett
said
and
meant.
and
all
i
mean
to
be
suggesting,
as
a
reader
of
the
opinion,
all
i
mean
to
be
suggesting
is
that
some
question
in
my
mind
is
left
open
about
whether
in
the
context
of
a
complete
trial
this
court's
opinion
in
gannett
truly
disposed
of
the
issue.
the
literal
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
was
not
quite
enough.
the
court
surely
looked
to
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
--
the
opinion
would
have
been
a
good
bit
shorter
had
the
linguistics
been
dispositive.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i'm
sure
that's
so.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
found
no
suggestion
in
this
court's
cases
either
way
on
that
issue.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
dissent
suggested
that
that
was
what
he
inferred
from
the
majority
opinion.
a
number,
of
--
only
one
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
certainly
don't
press
it.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well
the
reason
i
would
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
understand.
the
reason
i
would,
briefly,
is
that
the
sixth
amendment's
central
purpose,
surely,
is
protecting
the
accused.
he
might
be
compromised
were
there
a
sixth
amendment
right
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
demand
access.
because
the
very
hearing
on
that
question
would
involve
the
ventilation
of
information
which
could
defeat
the
whole
point.
at
trial,
creating
an
analogous
enforceable
right
on
the
part
of
the
public
would
not
involve
the
inevitable
compromise
of
the
right
at
stake.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
reception
of
evidence
intended
to
be
received
by
the
jury.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
about
to
turn
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
i
think
it's
a
stronger
argument.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
first
amendment,
even
if
one
reads
the
sixth
amendment
as
completely
inapplicable
and
conferring
no
rights
whatever
on
the
public,
it
sheds
an
important
light
on
the
first
amendment
claim.
under
the
first
amendment,
it's
of
course
established
that
more
than
simply
speaking
and
protected
watching
and
listening
may
be
protected
as
well.
it
is
also,
i
think,
quite
clear
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
a
sunshine
law
that
material
in
the
unilateral
control
of
government,
generated
by
government,
internal
to
government
deliberation,
is
not
automatically
accessible
to
people
who
invoke
the
first
amendment
and
use
the
slogan
of
a
right
to
know.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
clients
are
two
reporters
and
a
newspaper.
they
were
expelled,
however,
as
an
indiscriminate
sweep
of
the
general
public.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
of
the
press,
and
at
the
same
time,
they
are
citizens
and
members
of
the
public.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
correct.
but
i
am
not
--
i'm
making
nothing
special
of
their
status
as
members
of
the
press.
that
is,
were
these
two
reporters
not
members
of
the
press
they
would
have
been
expelled
just
the
same,
and
we
would
still
be
here
arguing
that
the
closuren
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
we'd
have
the
same
first
amendment
argument.
the
first
amendment
argument
that
--
i
would
be
rather
distressed
about
a
principle
that
says
that
only
members
of
the
press
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
i
think
it's
important
that
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
i
think
it's
terrific.
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
even
without
relying
on
the
separate
institutional
status
of
the
press
--
and
without
making
any
claim
that
the
press
has
greater
rights,
the
first
amendment
is
violated
when
government
exercises
the
kind
of
power
that
was
exercised
here.
now
let
me
describe
that
power.
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
accused
did
not
have
a
right
to
a
private
proceeding
that
is,
the
accused
could
not
demand
that
it
be
private.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
since
that
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
into
this
court?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
ah-hah.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
that
inquiry
into
the
way
the
information
will
be
used
is
either
necessary
or
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
he
certainly
would.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
even
though
he's
not
a
member
of
the
press.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
or
if
he's
simply
going
to
educate
himself
with
it,
and
use
it
to
be
a
more
intelligent
voter
on
all
kinds
of
matters.
the
kind
of
power
that
was
exercised
here,
given
that
the
accused
doesn't
have
the
right
to
make
it
a
closed
proceeding,
but
only
the
option
to
request
that
it
be
closed,
is
a
governmental
power
to
decide.
within
the
class
of
cases
where
the
defense
requests
closure,
which
shall
be
available
to
public
knowledge,
and
which
shall
not?
now,
it's
at
that
stage
that
the
sixth
amendment
assumes
a
role
in
the
first
amendment
argument.
because
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
this
proceeding
cannot
be
described
as
an
in-total
governmental
proceeding.
neither
is
it
private,
nor
is
it
internal
government.
because
at
least
it
is
clear
that
the
accused
could
demand
that
it
be
open
to
the
public.
because
that
is
clear,
it
follows
that
asserting
a
first
amendment
right
of
access
here
in
no
way
commits
the
court
to
transforming
the
first
amendment
into
a
sunshine
law.
those
areas
of
documents,
deliberations,
buildings
that
are
not,
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
accessible
to
the
public
at
least
on
the
demand
of
someone
outside
of
government's
control
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
under
the
first
amendment
standards
that
i
think
appropriate
in
this
case,
a
showing
of
some
compelling
need,
which
could
be
served
only
by
the
closure
of
a
trial
and
without
which,
some
equally
transcendent
value
would
be
compromised
would
suffice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
one
isn't
even
close
to
the
line
here,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
attempting
to
articulate
the
precise
circumstances
on
a
record
of
this
kind
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
gannett
itself?
i
find
on
reflection
that
that
was
a
very
--
to
me
a
very
close
case
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
on
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
on
the
first
amendment
grounds,
i
think
i
would
have
to
think
that
gannett
ought
to
have
been
opened.
but
i
must
say
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it
was
close.
but
i
don't
think
this
case
is
close,
and
this
is
the
case
that
i'm
arguing
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it's
precisely
the
absence
of
findings
that
makes
it
--
that
aggravates
the
clarity
of
the
case.
one
of
the
obligations,
surely,
given
the
first
amendment
rights,
would
be
to
establish
some
basis
in
the
record
for
the
supposition
that
fairness
was
at
risk,
and
could
be
saved
only
by
closure.
under
this
court's
first
amendment
decisions
one
does
not
resolve
that
kind
of
doubt
on
a
silent
record
in
favor
of
suppressing
the
flow
of
information.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as
this
one
did.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
because
when
he
waves
it,
that
doesn't
transform
the
august
proceeding
of
a
criminal
trial
into
some
kind
of
internal
negotiation.
it's
not
plea
bargaining
with
here.
it's
the
formal
confrontation
of
the
state
with
the
accused.
the
fact
that
he
waived
it
then
puts
to
the
government
the
question,
does
the
government
want
the
people,
or
not,
to
see
what's
going
on?
and
it
was
the
government's
decision
ultimately
to
close
this
trial.
that
decision
was
triggered
by
the
accused's
request?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
if
you're
dealing
with
a
context
which
is
truly
internal
to
government,
in
which
government
has
unilateral
control
to
begin
with,
then
the
first
amendment
is
far
harder
to
apply.
because
at
that
point
you
don't
have
the
government
exercising
control
over
the
flow
of
information,
which
is
in
the
public
domain.
this
information
was
of
that
character
by
the
express
command
of
the
sixth
amendment,
even
if
you
read
the
sixth
amendment
narrowly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
guess
that
is
the
very
ultimate
issue
in
this
case.
how
do
you
characterize
it
when
the
defendant
has
waived
it?
we
would
characterize
it
as
still
public,
and
we
would
do
so,
partly
because
without
it
a
fundamental
cornerstone
of
the
constitution,
among
its
most
basic
tacit
postulates,
would
be
compromise.
and
we
think
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
it's
purpose
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
quite
true
that
the
public
can't
insist
that
there
be
a
jury
trial.
but
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
first
amendment
values
would
not
be
implicated
in
that
case.
that
is,
the
first
amendment
that
gives
members
of
the
public
who
want
to
know
what
is
going
on
a
special
kind
of
interest,
not
just
the
generalized
interest
that
everyone
might
have
in
seeing
some
of
the
constitutional
norms
uniformly
applied.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
i
think
to
transform
the
fact
that
there
is
less
information
around
into
a
first
amendment
claim
is
to
go
much
further
than
we
are
doing
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
it's
a
question
of
how
generous
one
is
with
the
word
"colorable".
let
me
reserve
a
small
amount
of
time,
if
i
might.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
initially
just
correct
a
couple
factual
things.
there
was
reliance
below
by
the
appellants
also
on
the
virginia
constitution's
due
process
provisions.
but
the
overwhelming
emphasis
was
on
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
there
was
not,
because
it
is
available
only
to
the
accused,
i
guess,
under
virginia
tradition,
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
was
right
there
was
no
case
law
to
rely
on.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
have
to
tell
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
certain,
but
that
was
my
impression.
the
first
amendment
argument
here
to
which
i
want
to
turn
is
perfectly
focused
on
mr.
justice
white's
question.
the
position
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
taking
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
the
accused
wanted
a
private
trial.
under
their
view,
even
if
the
accused
--
if
the
judge
simply
said,
"i
don't
want
anybody
to
know",
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
violation
because
they
think
the
first
amendment
really
protects
only
speech,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
otherwise,
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
in
lamont,
and
a
number
of
other
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
add
the
defendant's
request,
it
doesn't
change
anything.
it
is
just
a
request
by
a
private
individual
to
invoke
a
censorial
power
which,
by
this
court's
own
decisions
in
cases
like
lamont,
would
not
be
acceptable.
i
think
the
more
general
point
is
that
the
constitutional
philosophy
which
the
attorney
general
espouses
is
really
upside
down.
it
is
his
posture
that
this
court
should
be
a
problem
solver
and
wait
until
complicated
problems
arise
and
fashion
a
solution.
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
this
court's
role.
this
court
should
articulate
what
the
constitution
has
traditionally
meant,
and
it
has
traditionally
meant
what
was
perhaps
too
obvious
to
put
in
so
many
words
that
criminal
trials
are
to
be
public.
the
first
amendment
provides
a
perfect
textual
home
for
that
principle,
due
process
would
do
as
well.
and
a
violation
of
publicity
here
is
surely
not
rectified
by
the
existence
of
a
taperecording.
it
turns
out
to
be
garbled,
one
can't
hear
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
pell
and
even
hutchins.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
limits
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
hutchins.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
it
is
also
not
just
the
support
described
by
the
attorney
general.
the
suggestion
that
they
make
is
this
was
a
maverick
decision
by
the
trial
judge.
it
was
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
if,
on
the
firing
line,
people
are
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
closure
because
they
don't
want
to
get
reversed,
and
do
that
in
circumstances
like
this,
it
becomes
important
even
from
the
attorney
general's
perspective
--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
this
was
what
he
regards
as
an
acceptable
decision,
then
i
think
it
proves
the
need
for
this
court's
intervention
in
the
name
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amends.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
am
not
defending
the
defendant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
first
amendment
will
have
to
be
vindicated
somehow.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
have
no
idea
at
all.
the
prosecutor
is
elected,
i
suppose,
to
serve
a
certain
public
role.
but
surely
he
does
not
control
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
becomes
problematic.
it's
hard
to
see
i
imagine
under
any
state
constitution
how
a
prosecutor
could
explain
the
exercise
of
that
kind
of
power.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rinship
case
drawing
only
on
the
general
language
of
the
due
process
clause
is
a
perfect
parallel
because
in
rinship,
the
court
held
that
one
of
the
fundamental
reasons
that,
even
though
it
is
not
mentioned,
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
implicit
in
the
constitution
is
that
it
is
central
to
trust
in
the
system
of
justice
and
central
to
legitimacy.
certainly
no
less
central
is
the
right
of
public
trial.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
tradition
as
well,
both
in
rinship
and
here,
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases
provides
an
additional
basis
for
making
it
clear
that
the
court
is
not
fashioned
in
a
new
light,
that
this
is
the
oldest
and
best
established.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
would
be
much
broader
and
one
would
have
to
know
more
than
i
have
discovered
about
the
tradition
in
civil
cases
to
be
absolutely
sure,
but
the
court
needn't
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart's
majority
opinion
took
the
position
that
even
if
the
first
amendment
applied,
on
the
record
in
gannett,
it
was
adequately
served.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
will
be
nonetheless
one
way
to
resolve
that
question
without
overruling
gannett,
and
that
is
as
a
prophylactic
device
one
can
say
that
in
a
context
like
pretrial
suppression
hearings
where
the
requirement
of
showing
compelling
need
institutionally
would
be
impossible
to
meet
but
where,
nonetheless,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
indeed
there
is
a
compelling
need,
though
you
can't
prove
it.
that
the
requirements
of
the
first
amendment
can
be
somewhat
relaxed
because
of
the
powerful
conflict
of
the
right
of
a
fair
trial.
in
the
context
of
a
trial,
there
is
no
similar
reason
to
relax
the
meaning
of
compelling
necessity.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
one
might
justify
what
gannett
suggested
at
a
permissible
over
caution
in
the
interest
of
the
rights
of
the
accused.
but
it
would
not
distress
me
greatly
were
one
to
conclude
that
perhaps
a
tighter
standard
should
have
been
applied
in
gannett.
this
case
doesn't
require
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you
could
prevail
by
applying
any
standard
other
than
no
need
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
