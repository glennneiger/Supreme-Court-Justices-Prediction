justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
ordinance
also
requires
license
for
for-profit
solicitations,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
did
the
respondents
here
ever
apply
under
that
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you--has
it
ever
been
interpreted
by
the
illinois
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
either
party
request
the
district
court
to
abstain
so
that
the
state
courts
could
engage
in
some
of
these
constructions
of
the
ordinance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
there
are
constitutional
cases
from
this
court
saying
that
you
can't
lodge
total
discretion
in
the
power--in
the
chief
of
police
to
issue
ordinances,
and
things
like
that.
but
my
thought
was
that
the
constitutional
result
may
be
entwined
with
how
you
interpret
your
own
ordinance,
and
that
that
is
something
that
is
a
province
of
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shadur,
could
your
client
have
gotten
a
license
under
article
ii
rather
than
article
i?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say,
in
effect,
then,
there's
no
way
that
a
municipal
corporation
can
accomplish
the
result
that
they
want
to
accomplish
here.
they
can't
do
it
by
lodging
discretion
in
the
chief
of
police,
and
they
can't
do
it
by
the
objective
profile
that
they've
attempted
to
do
under
article
i.
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
people
can
come
around
and
solicit
money,
and
that
there's
simply
nothing
they
can
do
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
village
council
held
a
hearing
at
which
due
notice
was
given
and
said
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
cbe
has
engaged
in
fraudulent
representations
within
this
village,
and
we're
here
to
determine
that.
and
if
we
do
determine
it,
we're
going
to
bar
them
from
soliciting
in
this
town.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
suppose
that
only--that
they
allowed
them
to
solicit
until
the
hearing
was
over.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
solicitors
for
cbe
take
the
money
they've
raised
in
two
weeks
of
soliciting
and
just
take
it
to
the
caribbean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could
the
village
reverse
the
presumption
you're
talking
about
and
say
that
soliciting
is
prohibited
except
on
property
where
there
is
a
soliciting
permitted
sign?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
martin
ordinance
presumed
that
they
knew--that
they
had
to
know
the
law
that
they
would
have
to
post
a
no-soliciting
sign.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
ordinance
required
that
the--after
the
first
year
of
operation
that
the
solicitor
hand
out
a
card
saying
that
in
the
past
fiscal
year
x
percent
was
devoted
to
administrative
expense,
and
x
percent
was
devoted
to
the
ultimate
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
first
amendment
doesn't--refer
especially
to
charities,
does
it?
