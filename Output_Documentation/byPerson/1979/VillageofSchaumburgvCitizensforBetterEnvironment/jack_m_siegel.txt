mr.
jack
m.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
one
question,
the
question
of
whether
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
invalidates
the
provisions
of
section
20,
paren
g,
of
chapter
22
of
the
schaumburg
village
code.
these
sections
require
that
as
condition
to
receive
a
permit
for
charitable
solicitation
within
the
village
there
must
be
presented
a
certified
audit
or
other
comparable
evidence
that
75
percent
of
the
proceeds
will
be
used
directly
for
the
charitable
purposes
of
the
organization
seeking
to
solicit.
the
ordinance
covers
both
door-to-door
solicitation,
and
the
use
of
public
streets
and
public
ways
within
the
village.
the
district
court
held
that
specific
provision,
and
that
specific
provision
alone,
to
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
action
was
initiated
by
declaratory
judgment
action
brought
by
the
citizens
for
a
better
environment,
an
allegedly
environmental
group
that
sought
a
permit
and
complied
with
all
other
requirements
of
the
ordinance
except
the
75
percent
provision.
on
appeal
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
ordinance
was
not
necessarily
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
as
applied
to
what
the
court
said
was
the
more
traditional
forms
of
charitable
organizations;
but
nevertheless,
sustained
a
summary
judgment,
and
held
that
the
statute
in
question--the
ordinance
in
question
was
unconstitutional
when
applied
to
an
organization
which
allegedly
was
involved
in
the
dissemination
of
information
and
political
discussion.
our
position
here,
your
honors,
is
first,
that
the
ordinance
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face;
is
not
unconstitutional
as
applied.
at
the
very
least,
we
suggest--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
your
honor,
that's
a
question--that
remains
to
be--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
there
was
summary
judgment.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
the
court
acted
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
it's
alleged
in
the
pleadings,
your
honor,
and
it's
denied
in
our
answer.
we
allege
as
affirmative
defense
is
the
fact
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
funds
in
fact
go
to
the
solicitors
and
to
the
organizers
of
the
group;
and
we
suggest
that
a
summary
judgment
was
improperly
granted.
we
think
it's
apparent
from
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
great
problem
with
this
issue;
it
in
effect
held
that
this
ordinance
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
was
unconstitutional
as
applied.
and
yet
we
suggest
that
they--that
that
court
could
not
have
reached
that
conclusion
without
some
evidence.
the
only
affidavits
in
support
of
the
motion
were
the
very
skeleton
affidavits
which
appear
at
page
40
and
43
of
the
appendix.
these
affidavits,
in
essence,
say
that
this
organization
was
created
under
the
laws
of
illinois;
that
it's
a
not-for-profit
organization;
that
they
maintain
a
group
of
solicitors;
and
that
they
go
from
door
to
door;
and
that
they
give
out
environmental
information,
and
take
complaints.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
this
case
was
initiated
by
the
cbe
against
22
villages
and
cities
in
illinois.
judge
marshall
at
the
district
level
sustained
summary
judgments
on
a
number
of
ordinances,
most
of
which
simply
required
a
permit,
and
left
discretion
with
either
the
police
department
or
the
village
board.
our
ordinance,
we
believe,
is
substantially
different
from
the
other
ordinances
in
question,
because
it
does
not
vest
any
discretion
in
the
administrative
officers.
it
sets
forth
what
we
believe
to
be
definite
standards
guiding
the
issuance
of
a
permit.
and
if
the
applicant
meets
all
the
requirements
of
the
permit,
the
village
is
required
to
issue
a
permit.
and
that
is
uncontested.
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
ordinance
as,
in
fact,
a
mandatory
requirement
if
all
the
conditions
were
met.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
they
are.
and
i
indicated
in
my
reply
brief
the
substantial
number
of
national
organizations
that
have,
in
fact,
complied
with
this
ordinance.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
think
it's
a
question
of
reasonableness.
i
think
the
ft.
worth
case,
which
held
an
80
percent
requirement
valid,
indicates
that
it's
a
question
of
reasonableness.
we
view
this,
your
honor,
as
not
an
attack
on
freedom
of
speech
at
all,
but
as
a
police
power
regulation
in
which
the
local
community
has
made
a
determination
that
in
order
to
protect
its
citizens
both
from
physical
danger,
if
you
will,
from
annoyance,
from
disturbance
in
their
homes;
but
also
from
what
we've
loosely
referred
to
as
fraud;
that
we
have
the
right
to
require
that
when
a
terrible
organization
comes
into
town
and
says
that
it's
soliciting
for
charity,
that
in
fact
it
devotes
a
substantial
portion
of
their
funds
to
charity.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
sole
purpose
was
advertising--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
--then
the
ordinance
would
permit
solicitation.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
i
don't--i
think,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
it
does
say
so.
i
think
the
section
of
the--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
take
it
that
advertising
is
in
conjunction
with
the
solicitation.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
if
the
only
use
of
the
funds
was
for
public
education--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
--and
that
was
for
a
charitable
purpose,
whether
it
be
advertising--yes--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
--in
a
broad
sense,
certainly.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct.
but
the
advertising
expenses
go
to
the
operation
of
the
solicitation.
if
the
sole
objective
of
the
organization
was
advertising,
then
100
percent
of
the
proceeds
would
go
to
the
charitable
purpose
for
which
it
was
organized.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
we're
talking
about--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
absolutely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes.
that's
a
different
subsection
of
the
chapter
of
the
municipal
code.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
this
particular--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
it
hasn't.
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
case
of
scott
v.
police
hall
of
fame,
which
interpreted
or
at
least
passed
upon
the
illinois
charitable
solicitation
act,
statute.
in
that
act,
there
is
a
75
percent
requirement
in
which
the
charitable
organization
is
permitted
to
deduct
the
cost
of
solicitation
before
it
arrives
at
its
75
percent
figure.
that
statute
was
attacked
on
the
grounds
that
it
invaded
the
first
amendment;
the
75
percent
requirement,
regardless
of
how
you
calculated
it,
was
an
abridgement
of
the
first
amendment,
presumably
based
on
the
theory
that
anything
that
they
did
in
the
course
of
collections
was
immune,
because
of
the
first
amendment.
and
the
appellate
court,
which
is
not,
obviously,
the
supreme
court,
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
first
amendment
by
putting
that
75
percent--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
sir.
this
case
was
brought
by
the
cbe
in
the
federal
court.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
state
court
has
never
been
asked
to
pass
upon
this
kind
of
the
ordinance.
the
cbe
has
been
active,
as
they
say
in
their
brief,
in
a
number
of
federal
cases.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
this
is
a
matter
which
is
peculiarly
susceptible
to
local
determination.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
really
a
first
amendment
case;
this
is
a
police
power
case.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
would
suggest
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
i
did
not
suggest
that--they
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
the
same
day
they
filed
their
amended
complaint.
i
was
given
15
days
in
which
to
answer
both.
and
it
happened
very
rapidly.
there
was
no
discovery,
there
was
no
nothing
in
this
case.
i
think
the
record
is
very
bare,
as
i
suggest
in
my
argument
that
summary
judgment
is
totally
inappropriate
based
upon
this
record.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
absolutely--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
think
it
would
apply.
i
think
that
was
sort
of
what
hynes
v.
oradell
was--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
would
say
that
they
would
meet
the
requirement.
if
they
had
paid
solicitors,
which
is
admitted
in
this
case.
if
they
said,
we
want
to
elect
james
johnson;
give
us
$10;
we'll
keep
the
$5
for
ourselves
and
we'll
give
$5
to
james
johnson.
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
this
ordinance
is
intended
to
prevent.
because
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
very
serious
problem--at
least
there
was
in
schaumberg--of
people
knocking
on
the
doors
at
all
hours
of
day
and
night.
and
your
honor,
in
the
hynes
case
said,
that
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
knock
on
anybody's
door
on
private
premises.
we
feel
the
legislative
body
made
the
determination
that
when
all
the
funds
go
to
a
charitable
purpose,
we
are
willing,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
other
requirements,
to
permit
this
invasion
into
the
privacy
and
the
possible
threat
to
our
householders.
but
when
organizations
parade
themselves
in
the
mantle
of
charity,
and
in
fact
have
an
undisclosed
amount
going
directly
to
the
people
who
solicit
the
funds,
rather
than
for
the
charitable
purpose,
then
we
have
the
right,
as
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
i
think
going
back
to
cantwell,
going
back
to
martin,
certainly
in
hynes,
indicating
that
this
is--that
these
are
very
important
public
rights
that
the
municipal
government
has
full
power
to
preserve.
as
i
indicate
over
and
over
again
in
my
brief,
i
think
the
closest
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
one
was
that
ft.
worth
case
in
1969
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
court
of
appeals
there
said
that
a
municipality
can
deny
permission
to
solicit
if
the
cost
of
solicitation
is
excessive.
and
they,
relying
on
cases
that
predated
hynes,
actually
recognized
this
court's
view
that
this
was
an
important
municipal
interest.
so
our
position,
your
honors,
is
simply
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
prior
restraint.
it's
not
a
case
of
interference
with
freedom
of
speech.
we
have
no
desire
to
keep
cbe
or
anybody
else
from
spreading
the
message.
our
desire,
and
we
think
this
ordinance
is
a
carefully
drawn
and
a
clear
ordinance--our
desire
is
simply
to
protect
our
householders
from
the
problems
of
invasion
of
privacy,
from
fraud
if
you
will,
from
misrepresentation,
and
to
preserve
what
we
feel
is
very
important,
a
constitutional
right,
perhaps,
almost
as
important
as
the
first
amendment,
that
is
the
right
to
be
left
alone.
i
think
that
in
hynes
this
court
quoted
professor
chafee
writing
back
in
1945
where
he
indicated
that
this
was
the
least
likely
type
of
expression
to
receive
protection
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
it
might
be.
it
might
be
even
more
effective.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
issue.
i
think
the
issue
is
-
has
the
local
government,
which
has
made
this
decision,
infringed
upon
the
first
amendment?
i
can
think
of
perhaps
a
dozen--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
think,
frankly,
your
honor
that
this
is
probably
not
a
first
amendment
case.
i--in
reading
the
decisions,
i
find
no
decisions--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
the
cases,
your
honor,
that
we
have
to
contend
with--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
all
these--the
religious
cases,
your
honor--and
those
obviously,
the
schneider
v.
irvington
and
martin
v.
struthers,
beginning
with
the
jehovah's
witnesses
cases,
all
involved
door-to-door
solicitation
by
people
who
denote
themselves
as
evangelists
or
missionaries
to
whom--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
think
they
were
spreading
the
gospel.
they
felt
that
this
was
part
and
parcel
of
their
religious
function.
and
i
think
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
think
that
the
religion
cases,
although
they
certainly
give
us
guidance,
are
not
determinative
of
the
issue
here.
because
very,
very
frankly,
we
believe
that
we
are
engaged
much
more
in
the
question
of
limitations
on
commercial
speech.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
they
could
do
that
without
a
license.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
it's
the
question
of
collecting
the
money
that
brings
them
within
the
purview
of
our
ordinance.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
they
were
doing
both,
and
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
inquire
into
just
what
in
fact
they
were
doing.
i
trust
that
your
honors
will
look
at
the
affidavits
on
page
40
and
43,
and
perhaps
look
at
that
district
court
case,
the
smith
case,
where
they
say
the
major
constitutional
questions
should
not
be
decided
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
that
the
record
should
be
fleshed
out.
and
we
were
prepared
to
flesh
out
the
record.
we
were
prepared
to
show
a
substantial
number
of
organizations,
only
a
portion
of
which
i've
listed
in
my
reply
brief,
who
operate,
and
operate
very
efficiently,
under
our
ordinance.
i
think,
your
honors,
that
there
are
certain
basic
constitutional
propositions
which
are
dispositive
of
the
case
here.
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
hynes
v.
oradell
holds
there
is
no
right
under
the
constitution
to
knock
on
a
private
person's
door
for
any
purpose.
we
believe
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
make
public
solicitation
of
funds
for
charity.
i
cite
the
national
foundation
v.
city
of
ft.
worth.
we
believe,
both
under
the
national
foundation
case,
and
actually
implicit
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
a
municipality
can
deny
permission
to
solicit
if
the
cost
of
solicitation
is
excessive.
i
think
the
court
below
in
this
case
recognized
that.
in
this
court,
in
hynes
v.
oradell,
citing
martin
v.
struthers,
citing
cantwell,
said
that
there
are
important
municipal
interests
at
stake,
and
these
include
protection
of
fraud,
peaceful
enjoyment
of
one's
home,
and
prevention
of
crime.
also,
this
court
has
always
held
that
time,
place
and
manner,
even
assuming
the
exercise
of
a
first
amendment
right,
was
critical;
the
nature
of
the
form
is
important.
the
right
of
privacy
in
the
home
is
to
be
protected.
and
of
course
in
the
lehman
v.
city
of
shaker
heights,
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
are
heavily
weighted
toward
the
fact
that
no
one
should
be
subjected
to
unasked
for
bombardments
of
voices
or
conversation
or
music
or
anything
under
the
guise
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
your
honor,
we're
not
unmindful
of
the
first
amendment.
we
made
a
definite
choice.
we
perhaps
could
draft
an
ordinance,
although
we
made
no
attempt
to
do
so,
that
would
have
prevented
all
kinds
of
disturbances.
that
wasn't
the
intent.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
there
was
a
legislative
intent
here
to
limit
the
solicitations
in
a
manner
which
we
felt
did
not
impinge
upon
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
but
when
the,
if
you
will,
quasi-commercial
character
of
raising
money
became
involved,
then
we
felt
that
we
were
engaged
in
a
proper
exercise
of
police
power.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
exactly.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
i
think
there
are
two
or
three
different
bases
which
are
served
by
this
type
of
ordinance.
one--and
these
are
coupled
together
in
the
cases,
from
cantwell
on
down--fraud,
misrepresentation,
privacy,
crime;
the
litany
is
recited
in
all
of
these
cases,
because
these
are
fundamental
aspects
of
the
police
power
which
the
municipalities
have
always
held--been
held
to
have
the
power.
now
it
happens
in
illinois
that
towns
over
25,000
such
as
schaumburg
are
home
rule,
and
we
get
our
home
rule
police
power
directly
from
the
constitution.
so
we
didn't
have
to
go
through
the
intermediate
question
of
whether
there's
a
statute.
and
we
do
have
the
authority
to
regulate
and
to
enact
ordinances
in
any
area
where
the
general
assembly
has
the
authority;
and
there's
no
question
that
the
regulation
of
charity
is,
in
fact,
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
can
tell
you
how,
because
i
drafted
the
ordinance.
we
looked--we
looked
at
the
state
statute,
the
75
percent
restriction.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
it
is
not.
there's
a
75
percent
number
in
the
state
statute.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
but
the
formula
is
different.
they
are
allowed
to
deduct
the
cost
of
solicitation.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
our
ordinance
specifically
does
not
permit
that.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that's
correct.
and
we
do
it,
because
we
feel
that
the
state
statute,
while
a
step
in
the
right
direction,
permits
the
kind
of
solicitation
which
cbe
apparently
is
involved
in;
and
we
really
don't
know
because
we
never
tried
it.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
we
knew
that--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
first
of
all,
i
did
a
little
research
and
i
came
up
with
the
ft.
worth
case,
where
the
court
had
held
80
percent.
and
i
felt
at
that
time
that
was
the--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
we
didn't.
we
could
have
taken
80
percent;
we
took
75
percent.
based
on
ft.
worth,
we
could
have
taken
80
percent.
but
that,
to
my
mind,
that
opinion--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
perhaps
we
would
have.
i
think
if
ft.
worth
had
said
there
was
an
absolute
bar,
we
might
have
considered
that.
but
it
didn't
say
that,
and
this
court
denied
cert.
so
we
assumed
that
for--at
that
time
at
least
there
was
a
settled
federal
court
of
appeals
case,
the
only
one
were
able
to
find
on
this
particular
subject,
and
we
had
a
state
statute
which
recognized
that
the
75
percent
cutoff
was
a
reasonable
cutoff
as
between
what
is
administrative
and
what
is
otherwise.
that
would--none
of
that's
in
the
record.
but
this--this
is
the
kind
of
thinking
which
went
into
the
drafting
of
the
ordinance
and
the
legislative
discrimination
which
we
think
is
peculiarly
the
province
of
the
local
government
and
not
necessarily
for
the
federal
courts.
i
would--mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
remarks
of
my
opponents
that
they
think
the
charities
are
entitled
to
some
specific
protection,
which
i
do
not
read
in
the
first
amendment.
they
make
an
assumption
that
the
first
amendment
gives
an
unrestricted
right
to
solicit
funds.
i
read
nothing
in
the
first
amendment,
or
in
any
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
which
could
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
yarmolinski
complains
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid
as
to
traditional
charitable
organizations.
not
even
the
seventh
circuit,
whose
opinion
i
disagree
with
almost
110
percent,
was
willing
to
go
that
far,
and
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
yarmolinski
decries
the
possibility
of
a
patchwork
of
ordinances.
this
nation
is
a
patchwork
of
municipalities
and
states,
each
of
which
have
local
problems
and
local
needs
which
better
ought
to
be
addressed
by
those
governments
closest
to
them.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
your
honor,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
first
amendment
that
would
prohibit
that.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
decide
that
question
here.
but
i
think
that
what
counsel
is
really
seeking
is
an
unbridled
right
to
solicit,
because
these
are
quote,
good
causes.
they
may
be
fine
causes.
i
have
nothing
against
the
heart
fund,
the
cancer
group,
the
st.
judes,
the
dozens
who
solicit
in
schaumburg.
i
may
not
even
have
anything
against
the
cbe
if
i
find
out
what
it's
about.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
girl
scouts
are
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
they
do.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
they--they--they--they
serve--
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
we
don't
make
any
exceptions;
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
your
honor,
i
mean
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
was
concerned.
there
might
be
other
considerations.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well,
i
think
if
it
was
drafted
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
distinctions,
if
it
was
an
outright
prohibition,
i
suspect
it
would
probably
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
regard,
in
short,
solicitation
for
funds
alone
as
a
violation--a
prohibition
of
such
solicitation
as
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i
find
nothing
in
any
of
the
cases
that
would
indicate
that.
and
i
think
it's
quite
interesting--i've
got
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
briefs
from
the
various
amici,
as
well
as
mr.
shadur,
and
i
find
no
cases
in
any
one
of
them
that
goes
that
far.
it's
always,
solicitation
coupled
with
something
else.
our
ordinance
is
not
a
prior
restraint.
our
ordinance
doesn't
care
what
your
message
is.
god
bless
you
with
your
message.
but
when
you
start
asking
for
money,
then
we
say
that
the
community,
through
its
local
officials,
have
a
right
to
make
a
decision.
and
i
would
point
out,
because
i
know
your
honors
are
well
aware,
that
the
breard
case
said,
in
its
substance,
that
the
community
could
substitute
the
collective
judgment
for
that
of
the
individual.
and
the
mere
fact
that
you
post
a
sign
that
says,
no
solicitors,
doesn't
keep
solicitors
out.
we
had
that
no
soliciting
sign
for
four
years
in
our
ordinances
before
we
adopted
the
present
ordinance
which
is
here
in
contention.
because
unfortunately,
when
commissioners--when
solicitors
work
on
a
commission,
they
don't
always
pay
attention
to
such
signs,
and
unfortunately,
bewildered
housewives--and
i
don't
mean
to
paint
a
horrible
picture
here--but
it's
a
terrible
burden
on
an
individual
housewife
to
have
to
go
through
the
procedures,
in
illinois
at
least,
to
file
a
complaint
for
trespassing.
i
think
it's
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
traditional
remedies
against
fraud
and
trespass
are
sufficient
to
deal
with
this
problem.
in
the
case
of
pure
first
amendment
freedoms,
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion,
we
certainly
can
say
that
that
inconvenience
is
outweighed
by
the
social
benefits.
but
when
the
objective
is
to
raise
money,
and
most
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
money
does
not
go
to
the
charitable
purpose,
i
suggest
that
the
municipality
and
the
interests
of
the
public
safety
are
entitled
to
enact
the
kind
of
ordinances
we've
enacted
here
without
infringing
upon
the
first
amendment.
i
ask
that
the
seventh
circuit
be
reversed.
