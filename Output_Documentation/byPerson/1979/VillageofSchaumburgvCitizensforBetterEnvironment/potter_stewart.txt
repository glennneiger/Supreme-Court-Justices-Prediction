mr.
siegel,
how
would
this
ordinance
operate?
and
i'm
asking
just
as
a
bit
of
information.
if
the
sole
charitable
purpose
of
the
organization
were
to
advertise,
to
advertise
the
plight
of
the
american
indian,
or
to
buy
advertising
in
periodicals
lamenting
the
plight
of
the
vietnam
refugee
or
whatever,
and
that
was
its
sole
charitable
purpose,
and
that
a
100
percent
of
its
funds,
act
funds,
would
be
used
for
advertising.
and
yet
you
have
to
deduct
advertising
expenses
under
this
ordinance,
as
i
understand
it,
before
you
count
the
75
percent.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
say
so.
it
doesn't
seem
to
say
so.
justice
potter
stewart
it
says--it's
20(g)
of
chapter
22
of
the
village,
subsection
2,
requires
the
deduction
of
advertising
expenses
before
the
75
percent
figure.
justice
potter
stewart
for
advertising.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
is
advertising.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
what--advertising
expenses
is
what
the
ordinance
says.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
your
point.
you--your
submission
is
that
administrative
expenses
of
the
organization,
including
but
not
limited
to--
justice
potter
stewart
--advertising.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
administrative
expenses
of
the
organization
limits
the
term
"advertising"?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
citizens
for
a
better
environment
said
that
was
precisely
what
they
were
doing
here,
spreading
information
about
environmental
developments.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
were
doing
both,
as
were
the
jehovah's
witnesses--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except--except
this
ordinance
doesn't,
at
least
by
its
terms,
direct
itself
to
protecting
the
privacy
of
homeowners
and
leasees,
but
rather,
with
the
solicitation
of
funds.
it
doesn't
purport
to
prevent,
as
my
brother
white
suggested,
all
sorts
of
visitations
on
the--
justice
potter
stewart
--the
householders,
in
an
effort
to
propagandize
them
in
one
respect
or
another.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
its
purpose,
to
protect
the
citizenry
from
some
sort
of
species
of
fraud,
not
in
the
technical
sense,
but
of
being--paying
out
their
money
thinking
it
was
going
to
a
cause,
a
worthy
cause,
and--
justice
potter
stewart
--and
more
than
25
percent
of
it
was
not
going
to
the
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
different
from
protecting
the
privacy
of
households.
justice
potter
stewart
what,
mr.
shadur,
if
the
ordinance,
instead
of
requiring
satisfactory
proof
that
at
least
75
percent
of
the
proceeds
of
the
solicitations
would
be
used
for
the
charitable
purposes,
said
that
if--before
issuing
a
license
it
would
require
satisfactory
proof
that
at
least
some
of
the
proceeds
of
such
solicitations
would
be
used
for
the
charitable
purposes?
