mr.
milton
i.
shadur
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
told
us
that
he
drafted
the
ordinance
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
i
would
submit
with
respect
that
what
counsel
is
seeking
to
do
here
is
to
write
a
new
ordinance
and
to
make
a
new
record
from
the
one
that's
before
this
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
a
summary
judgment.
the
summary
judgment
is
not
based
on
pleadings;
the
summary
judgment
is
based,
as
is
quite
proper,
on
affidavits.
we
had
both
a
sworn
complaint
and
supporting
affidavits,
and
those
contained
very
specific
references
to
precisely
the
kind
of
activity
that
was
involved
here
with
citizens
for
a
better
environment.
what
citizens
for
a
better
environment
concededly
does,
on
this
record,
is
to
employ
canvassers
who
are
engaged
in
door-to-door
activity
in
the
metropolitan
area
who
distribute
literature
on
environmental
topics
and
answer
questions
of
an
environmental
nature
when
posed;
solicit
contributions
to
financial
support
the
organization
in
this
program;
like
traditional
charities,
this
organization
does
not
survive
on
air,
although
it
deals
with
air.
one
of
its
purposes,
if
it's
going
to
disseminate
literature,
is
that
it
has
to
have
funds
with
which
to
do
it.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
organizations
that
require
the
obtaining
of
funds
in
order
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
i
would--i
think
that
perhaps,
although
i
can't
read
the
mind
of
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
reference
to
the
traditional
form
of
charitable
organization,
as
distinct
from
the
kind
here
that
is
directly
involved
in
programmatic
activity,
is
the
possibility
that
fund
raising
for
charities
alone
may
not
carry
with
it--and
i
don't
perceive
the
specific
example--but
could
not
carry--necessarily
carry
with
it
the
desire
to
communicate
ideas.
i
would
think
that
the
traditional
charities
are
subject
to
the
same
provisions
that
the
american
cancer
society,
which
wants
to
educate
the
public
on
issues
of
cancer,
and
needs
funds
in
order
to
do
that,
would
also
be
in
a
position
to
attach
the
ordinance
that
your
honor
suggests
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
just
staying
away
from
my
door,
to
quote
the
old
song,
is
really
inappropriate,
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it's
been
true
for
at
least
40
years.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
is
that
that
places
the
judgment
exactly
where
this
court
says
that
it
should
be.
it
places
that
judgment
on
the
individual
householders,
not
in
the
community.
the
community
is
not
in
a
position
to
make
a
collective
judgment
for
everyone,
that
may
be
very
different
from
what
the
individual
judgement.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
not
raising
money
alone,
but
raising
money
for
purposes--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
your
honor--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
beginning
with
this
court's
decision
in
martin
v.
struthers,
for
example,
when
we're
dealing
with
the--when
we're
dealing
with
the
raising
of
money--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
your
honor,
if
the
organization
were
raising
money
for
the
sake
of
raising
money,
then
you
would
be
dealing
with
a
for-profit
organization.
the
for-profit
organization
that
may
not
be
engaged
in
communications
would
have
no
protection
by
the
first
amendment.
but
the
organization
that
raises
money
for
its
purposes,
for
its
purposes
being
the
charitable
purposes,
which
is
what
this
ordinance
talks
about.
and
those--and
after
all,
that's
precisely
what
the
ordinance
is
directed
at,
the
raising
of
money
for
charitable
purposes.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
the
magazine
sales
from
door
to
door,
which
are
strictly
commercial
speech--under
breard
v.
alexandria
we
had--we
had
a
case
that
dealt
with
that.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
that's
a
case
that's
not
before
this
court.
what
the
village
of
schaumburg
might
have
done
with
an
ordinance--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
am,
your
honor.
it
forbids
solicitation
for
money
by
charitable
organizations,
and
it's
being
attacked
by
an
organization
that
wants
to
solicit
those
funds
to
permit
it
to
engage
in
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
requirement
that
dealt
directly
with
the
question
of
bona
fide,
which
is
what
that
ordinance
would
deal
with,
that
is,
that
at
least
one
percent,
at
least
some
of
the
funds
are
used,
under
those
circumstances,
the
community
could
seek
to
justify
the
organization--could
seek
to
justify
the
ordinance
as
a
means
of
preventing
fraud.
but
i
would
call
your
honor's
attention
to
one--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
let
me,
however,
give
you
the
example--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
take
the
organization
that's
just
starting
up,
the
organization
that
by
definition
has
to
use
all
of
its
initial
funds
for
administrative
functions
to
permit
it
in
that
first
year--that's
an
example
that's
been
given
by
one
of
the
amicus
here,
the
organization
that's
in
its
first
year,
in
order
to
get
itself
started
on
what
is
concededly
a
charitable
purpose,
must
nevertheless
use
those
initial
funds
for
purposes
of
getting
itself
geared
up.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
as--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
on
over-breadth
grounds,
although
that's
not
the
problem
we
have--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--because
our
record
is--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
meant
by
over-breadth
grounds,
the
first
amendment.
let
me--let
me
return
to
what
we're
dealing
with
here
in
terms
of
the
organization,
and
what
this
ordinance
seeks
to
do.
this
ordinance
characterizes
charitable
purpose
in
a
sort
of
extraordinary
way.
because
it
doesn't
say
charitable
purpose
in
a
way
that,
for
example,
the
state's--the
state
statute
deals
with.
this
characterizes
charitable
purpose--and
nowhere
in
counsel's
reply
brief
or
anywhere
else
has
this
been
denied--as
applying
to
all
salaries
or
commissions
that
are
paid
to
cavassers,
even
though,
on
the
uncontradicted
record,
they're
people
who
in
addition
to
soliciting
funds
exercise
rights
that
are
first
amendment
rights.
it
excludes
all
other
salaries,
yet
this
is
an
organization,
an
environmental
organization,
that
has
on
its
staff--and
has
to
pay
for--an
in-house
research
staff,
an
expert
on
nuclear
power,
a
physicist,
a
biochemist,
a
geneticist.
all
those
funds
that
are
used
for
that
purpose
are
part
of
the
prohibited
25
percent,
and
not
part
of
the
permitted
75
percent.
lawyers'
fees
are
characterized
as
part
of
the
non-permitted
amount,
yet
the
organization
that's
involved
in
environmental
activities,
by
definition,
is
constantly
dealing
with
the
structure
of
the
environment;
that
means
dealing
with
the
government,
dealing
with
the
private
utilities;
and
it
has
to
engage
in
enforcement
activities.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
our
organization
is
not
a
for-profit
organization.
but,
in
response
to
your
question,
if
our--if
our
organization
had
to
cope
with
the
provisions
of
article
ii,
then
we
would
read
directly,
as
the
patent
lawyers
would
have
it,
on
the
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
early
in
these
areas,
and
that
is
saying
that
giving
discretion
to
the
public
officials
is
not
permitted.
because
the
second
portion
of
this
ordinance
requires--provides--and
i'm
reading
now
from
record
pages--page
19
in
the
appendix--when
the
chief
of
police
makes,
or
causes
to
be
made,
an
investigation
to
determine
the
character
and
reputation
of
the
applicant,
and
that
no
license
shall
be
issued
to
an
applicant
who
is
not
found
to
be
a
person
of
good
character
and
reputation,
or
to
any
firm,
corporation,
partnership
or
association.
under
those
circumstances,
what
happens
is
that
power
is
vested
in
the
municipal
official
to
make
that
kind
of
determination,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
say
that
that's
not
permitted.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
haven't
said
that
at
all.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
there
are
statutes
that
deal
with
fraud.
indeed,
other
sections
of
this
ordinance
deal
with
fraud.
there
are
sections--there
are
provisions
under
which
trespass
can
be
forbidden,
and
indeed
are.
if
the
purposes
that
are
sought
to
be
served
by
the
village
in
this
case
are
indeed,
as
they
proclaim,
the
prevention
of
fraud,
and
the
preservation
of
privacy,
there
are
adequate
legal
means
to
enable
them
to
do
that
without
creating
the
bed
of
procrustes
that--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--that's
set
up
by
this
75
percent
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
a
provision
in
the
ordinance
that
prohibits
trespass,
that
excludes
people
from
coming
onto
the
premises
of
homeowners
who
have
indicated
that
they
don't
want
to
be
bothered.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
by
posting
or
otherwise;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
as
a--as
a
precondition
to
permitting
cbe
to
solicit?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
and
then
we
had
a
hearing
as
to
fraud?
i
would
suggest
that
a
finding
of
fraud
in
that
kind
of
situation--it
would
be
permitted
to
preclude
fraudulent
activities.
that's
what
our
laws
about
fraud
deal
with.
but
what's
wrong
here
is
that
that's
very
different
from
this
case.
what
is
done
here
is
to
create
a
sort
of
conclusive
line
that
says
75.1
is
not
fraudulent;
74.9
is
fraudulent.
and
in
which
the
standards
that
are
employed
in
going
to
those
percentages
has
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
concept
of
fraud.
there's
nothing
in
the
activity
that
citizens
for
a
better
environment
is
engaged
in
as
established
by
the
record
in
this
case,
by
these
affidavits,
that
goes
into
the
prohibitive
side
of
it,
that
constitutes
fraudulent
activity.
all
of
these
things
serve
the
direct
first
amendment
rights,
and
serve
the
functions
of
the
public
as
well.
we're
dealing
with
both
sides
of
the
coin.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
are
statutes
that
permit
that;
indeed,
it
was
precisely
that
kind
of
activity
that
gave
rise
to
the
police
hall
of
fame
case
that
was
tried,
and
the
council
has
referred
to,
and
that
was
the
unfortunate
genesis
of
this
very
different
kind
of
ordinance.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
get
at
fraud?
your
honor--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
that's
how
fraud
has
historically
been
dealt
with
in
fundraising
activities,
as
well
as
anything
else.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
as
long
as
the
village
has
an
appropriate--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--kind
of
trespass
ordinance,
which
all
villages
that
i
know
of
do.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
oh,
yes.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
distinction
that
was
first
made
in
martin
v.
struthers,
and
that
i
believe
your
honor's
opinion,
in
hynes
v.
oradell,
adhered
to;
and
indeed,
in
between,
the
rowan
against
the
united
states
post
office,
in
which
this
court
upheld
a
restriction
of
just
that
kind--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--in
which
citizens
could
make
the
judgment.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
requiring
that
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
the
question
of
who
does
it
individually
and
who
does
it
collectively.
when
it's
done
individually,
no
matter
by
how
many
individuals,
the
individuals
are
making
a
judgment
for
themselves.
when
it's
done
collectively,
in
the
way
that
the
village
of
schaumburg
has
sought
to
do
it,
it's
a
sort
of
big
brother
activity
that
operates
whether
or
not
the
individual--individuals
who
also
have
first
amendment
rights.
the
individuals
have
first
amendment
rights
to
hear
messages.
they
also
have
first
amendment
rights
to
communicate
their
complaints.
that's,
as
i
say,
the
other
side
of
both
coins
that
citizens
for
a
better
environment
is
engaged
in.
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
standard.
and--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
think
that
would
present
very
serious
constitutional
problems.
and
the
reason
that
i
think
that
is
that--that
you
would
have
to
have
coupled
with
that
somehow
the
notion
that
all
people
are
presumed
to
know
the
law
in
a
very
literal
sense,
as
distinct
from
the
theoretical
sense
in
which
the
law
usually
treats
with
it.
unless
you
can
show
that--i
don't
like
to
get
back
into
the
preceding
case
which
dealt
with
intention--but
the
notion
that
somehow
people
are
presumed
to
know
that
an
ordinance
requires
that
if
they
want
to
be
informed,
they've
got
to
post--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor,
because
when
you
deal
with
first
amendment
rights,
you
have
to
have
a
narrowly
drawn
statutes.
i
would
suggest
that
a
presumption
that
flip-flops
in
the
manner
that
your
honor
has
suggested
would
be
a
serious
impediment.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
your
honor,
this
isn't--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
your
honor,
i
must
return
to
the
refrain
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
the
solicitation
of
funds
in
a
vacuum.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
solicitation
of
funds
that's
irrevocably
coupled
with
and
tied
to
the
exercise
of
speech
rights.
it's
not
that
they're--they're
not
raising
funds
to
go
to
the
carribean.
they
are
raising
funds
so
that
they
can
deliver
messages
dealing
with
the
environment;
so
that
they
can
engage
in
educational
activities
dealing
with
the
environment;
so
that
they
can
take
complaints
dealing
with
the
environment;
so
they
will
know
what
kind
of
positions
to
take
in
litigation,
in
connection
with
legislation.
all
those
things
are
not
simply
the
raising
of
funds.
they're
the
raising
of
funds
which
necessarily
carries
with
it
the
tie-in
with
the
exercise
of
first
amendment.
that's
a
notion
that
this
court
has
accepted
ever
since
the
jehovah's
witnesses
cases.
the
jehovah's
witnesses
cases
made
the
strong
point
that
the--that
it
is
the
poor
organization,
the
one
that
is
most
often
in
need
of
the
use
of
fund
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
to
whom
this
privilege
is
the
most
important.
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
that's--that's
a--what
i
think--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i'm
pleased
to
say
that
i
don't
have
to
confront
that
one.
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
one.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
it
is
not--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
it's
my
view,
and
this
is
how
i
tried
to
respond
to
chief
justice
burger's
question--it's
my
view
that
the
delivery
of
the
message
that
has
to
do
with
the
traditional
charity
itself
contains
the
ingredients
of
speech,
it
contains,
implicitly
at
least,
the--the
fact
that
you
contribute
to
the
american
heart
association
and
part
of
the
activity
that
they
engage
in,
or
the
boy
scouts
or
the
red
cross--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
think
that's
your--that's
your
freedom
of
speech.
whether
the--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes.
the
running
for
office
i
think
is
clearly--what
this
court's
teachings
have
been,
have
been
at
least,
at
a
minimum,
that
social,
political,
religious
activities--i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
to
confront
for
purposes
of
this
case
the
purely--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
would
not--i
would
not
necessarily
espouse
that
person's--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--on
a
first
amendment--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that--that
that
issue
deals
more
in
the
area
of
what
has
been
characterized
as
commercial
speech,
on
which
this
court
has
told
us
that
first
amendment
rights
extend,
but
not
necessarily
to
the
same
extent.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
i
don't
think
we
have
to
cope
with
it
at
this
point.
i
have,
by
leave
of
court,
agreed
to
give
a
portion
of
the
time
to
counsel
for
one
of
the
amici
curiae
that
had
filed
in
this
court.
and
therefore,
i'm
relinquishing
the
balance
of
my
time
for
that
purpose.
thank
you
very
much.
