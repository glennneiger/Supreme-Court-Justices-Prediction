chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1335,
village
of
schaumburg
against
citizens.
mr.
siegel,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
posture
of
the
case
now,
we
take
it
that
this--these
distributions
do
involve
the
dissemination
of
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
there
was
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
acted--the
court
acted
on
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
alleged
in
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
not
cover--are
you
suggesting
it
would
not
cover
advertising
if
it
were
directed
at
public
education?
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
door
to
door,
if
they
were
going
to
urge
people
to
vote
for
james
johnson
for
city
councilman
and
ask
for
a
contribution
to
his
campaign?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
measure
the
75
percent
then?
all
of
it--the
entire
solicitation
was
for
the
purpose
of
electing
james
johnson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shadur?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
ordinance
prohibited
all
solicitations
for
funds
entirely.
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
all--can
you
think
of
any
organization
that
would
not
require
funds
to
conduct--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
such
as?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
us--tell
us
what
some
of
those
methods
are.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
do
you
get
at
that?
how
does
a
municipality
get
at
that?
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prosecute
each
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
implied
before,
if
you
did
not
say,
that
i
could
put
up
a
sign--anyone
can
put
up
a
sign--saying
keep
out,
or
posted,
or
no
solicitors,
or
whatnot,
and
then--then
they
must
stay
out;
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
combination
of
the
ordinance,
the
action
of
the
municipality,
plus
the
sign?
now,
in
other
words,
i
can
deprive
you,
or
you
can
deprive
of
this
first
amendment
right
you
claim,
we
can
do
that
individually,
but
we
can't
do
it
collectively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--citizen
had
to
take
an
affirmative
step
there,
didn't
he?
just--he
had
to
notify
the
post
office
that
he
didn't
want
mail
from
the
acme
publishing
company,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
the
difference
in
the
constitutionality
of
doing
it
individually
and
collectively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
where
is
the
first
amendment
right
to
the
unregulated
solicitation
of
funds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unregulated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
yarmolinski?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
national?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
limit
to
national?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
a
statement
that
as
a
solicitor
of
cbe
i
receive
$8.50
an
hour
for
my
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
a
limitation
that
such
solicitations
could
be
made
only
between
7
p.m.
and
9
p.m.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
after
dark,
people
are
a
little
more
apprehensive
about--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
solicitation
would
be
only
between
those
two
hours
when
presumably
the
man
of
the
house
is
home
and
the
people
are
still
awake
and
it
isn't
too
late
to
call
for
help.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
just
two
hours
a
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
basic
first
amendment
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
there
is
an
underlying
first
amendment
argument
to
go
out
and
abroad
and
solicit
support
both
financial
and
all
other
areas
of
support
from
all
persons
except
those
who
forbid
it
in
some
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
way
they
do
it
at
the
airport,
where
the
solicitors
are
soliciting
largely
for
themselves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
yarmolinski.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
follow
from
your
position
that
an
ordinance
which
prohibited,
absolutely
and
totally,
all
door-to-door
solicitation
for
any
purpose
would
be
valid.
that
would
include
commercial,
which
you
said
everyone
agrees
has
somewhat
less
protection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
such
as?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
opinions
are
ready
for
announcement
by
mr.
justice
white,
the
village
of
schaumburg
against
citizens
for
a
better
environment
and
committee
for
public
education
and
religious
liberty
against
regan.
