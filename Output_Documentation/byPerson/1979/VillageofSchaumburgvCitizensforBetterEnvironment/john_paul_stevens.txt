john
paul

you
rely
heavily
on
the
connection--your
type
of
organization--between
the,
you
might
call
it,
propaganda
activity
and
the
solicitation
activity.
do
you,
in
effect,
concede
that
pure
solicitation
has
no
first
amendment
protection?
in
other
words,
say
if
the
american
red
cross
or
somebody
went
around,
all
it
wanted
to
say
was,
"please
give
some
money
to
the
red
cross."
is
there
any
first
amendment
protection
for
that
message?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that
there
is
none,
if
i
understand
your
argument.
because
you
rely
entirely
on
a
quite
different
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
you
may,
under
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical,
because
the
ordinance
could
possibly
have
been
written
to
say,
"you
can
say
anything
you
want
to,
but
don't
solicit
any
funds
at
all."
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you'd
say,
your
kind
of
organization
has
a
right
to
object
to
it,
but
maybe
the
red
cross
or
somebody
else
wouldn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you're
saying
that
you
have
two
first
amendment
interests
here,
in
effect,
one,
the
asking
for
funds
is
itself
first
amendment
protected;
and
secondly,
that
you
need
to
do
that
in
order
to
support
your
other
message.
