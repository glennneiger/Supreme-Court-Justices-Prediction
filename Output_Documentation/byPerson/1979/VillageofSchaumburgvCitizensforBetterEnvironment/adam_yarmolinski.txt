mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
propose
to
argue
briefly
two
points.
first,
the
ordinance
is
constitutionally
invalid
not
only
as
to
so-called
advocacy
organizations,
but
also
as
to
more
traditional
charitable
organizations.
second,
in
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance,
one
must
bear
in
mind
the
developing
patchwork
of
other
local
ordinances
not
addressed
to
interests
appropriate
for
local
government
to
protect,
and
having
a
particularly
chilling
effect
on
the
fundraising
efforts
of
national,
voluntary
charitable
organizations.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
national.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
don't
limit
it
to
national;
i'm
simply
speaking
on
behalf
of
a
number
of
major,
national
voluntary
charitable
organizations.
i
suppose
regional
organizations,
organizations
which
have
to
deal
with
large
numbers
of
local
regulations,
which
aren't
simply
soliciting
in
one
area,
and
therefore
can
adopt
their
solicitation
practices
to
the
needs
for
that
area
or
that
municipality.
now,
the
court
below
declined
to
decide
the
reasonableness
of
the
75
percent
requirement
as
applied
to
solicitation
by
traditional
charitable
organizations.
the
amici
for
whom
i'm
arguing
include
the
major
national
traditional
organizations,
and
the
arbitrary
percentage
limit
puts,
i
submit,
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
these
organizations.
solicitation,
including
door-to-door
solicitation,
is
essential
to
the
continuing
existence
of
these
organizations.
and
what
these
organizations
are
engaged
in
is
communicating
public
means,
whether
advocacy
or
more
traditional
means;
whether
they're
preaching
environmentalism
or
whether
they're
selling
girl
scout
cookies,
or
soliciting
money
for
the
heart
fund.
solicitation
involves
their
right
to
communicate,
and
it
involves
a
citizen's
right
to
receive
that
communication.
and
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
on
the
citizen's
side,
contribution
is
a
form
of
association.
there
have
been
several
references
to
martin
v.
struthers,
which
recognized
the
distinction
and
said
that
the
community
can't
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
householder,
the
judgment
in
this
case
of
spending
25
percent
of
contributions
on
what
the
village
authorities
deem
to
be
administrative
costs,
is
a
bar
to
solicitation.
i
do
think
one
has
to
distinguish
commercial
organizations.
that
distinction
was
recognized
in
schneider
and
other
cases.
one
has
to
distinguish
governmental
organizations
which
can
call
on
the
taxing
power.
the
amici
for
whom
i
speaking
in
many
cases
would
have
difficulty
surviving
under
the
regulations
governing
commercial
peddlers'
licenses.
now,
i
suggest
that
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
ordinance
is
an
unreasonable
restriction
as
applied
to
all
charitable
organizations,
not
just
to
advocacy
organizations.
the
proportion
of
contributions
that
goes
for
fundraising
is
largely
beyond
organizations'
control,
beyond
the
control
of
the
organization
that's
doing
the
fundraising.
for
example,
sometimes
causes
tend
to
attract
large
contributions
from
comparatively
well-off
people;
other
kinds
tend
to
attract
small
contributions
from
lower
income
people.
some
solicitation
goes
on
in
areas
where
population
is
concentration;
others
in
areas
where
it's
less
concentrated.
there
are
more
popular
causes;
less
popular.
better
established;
less
better
established.
and
there's
even
a
question
of
weather,
which
influences
the
ability
of
solicitors
to
cover
ground.
we
don't
suggest
that
the
charitable
organizations
for
whom
i'm
speaking
use
the
cloak
of
charity
to
mask
a
commercial
purpose;
quite
the
contrary.
they
need
the
cloak
of
charity
because
it's
the
only
cloak
they've
got.
now,
secondly,
ordinances
like
this
one
imply
judgment
about
the
means
by
which
the
organization
should
pursue
charitable
purposes,
a
judgment
which,
we
submit,
is
beyond
the
power
of
government,
and
certainly
beyond
the
power
of
local
government.
how
much
the
organizations
give
directly
to
beneficiaries;
how
much
they
spend
on
what
local
authorities
deem
to
be
administrative
purposes.
and
certainly
that
determination
involves
a
degree
of
discretion
which
seems
inconsistent
with
cases
in
which
the
court
has
been
concerned
about
the
degree
of
discretion
that's
accorded
to
local
authority.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
would
say
that
if
it
required
that
proof
for
an
initial
period,
it
would
certainly
be
invalid
because
we
all
know
of
cases
in
which
validly
charitable
organizations
must
spend
even
more
than
they
can
raise,
and
borrow
money,
in
order
to
survive
for
an
initial
period
which
may
run
more
than
a
fiscal
year.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
believe
that
that
would
almost
certainly
be
a
valid
constitutional
ordinance.
i
would
raise
a--at
least
a
question
as
to
the
appropriate
jurisdiction
to
enact
such
a
ordinance.
and
that
goes
to
my
patchwork
point,
which
i
had
mentioned
earlier.
because
there
is
a
good
deal
of
discretion
and
a
good
deal
of
flexibility
involved
in
defining
what
is
an
administrative
expense.
there's
an
extensive
footnote
in
our
brief
on
the
difference
between
the
1974
position
of
the
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants
and
the
1977
position,
which
happens
to
work
against
the
major
charitable
organizations
which
i
represent.
and
i
simply
suggest,
perhaps
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
if
you
told
me
that
such
a
provision
was
being
enacted
by
state--by
states,
or
by
the
congress,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
happy
solution
to
what
is
a
real
problem,
and
what
involves--as
any
case
reaching
this
court
does--a
balancing
of
interests.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
can't
see
any
constitutional
objection
to
that
requirement.
again,
unless
it
gets
into
the
patchwork
quilt.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
into
the
patchwork
problem,
the
problem
of
how
do
you
get
the
word
around
to
all
your
solicitors.
the
problem
of
door-to-door
solicitation--and
i'll
just
take
30
seconds
on
this
point
because
i
think
it
is
a
first
amendment
issue--it's
increasingly
difficult
for
even
the
largest
and
best
established
organizations
not
only
to
maintain
their
operations,
but
to
collect
the
money
they
need--part
of
the
money
they
need
to
collect
from
door-to-door
solicitations,
because
you
can't
get
solicitors,
because
people
are
unwilling
to
open
their
doors
at
night;
because
you
can't--because
they're
not
home,
because
the
members
of
the
household
are
not
home
during
the
day;
because
you
have
two
wage-earner
households.
so
that
what
we're
dealing
here
is
an
economic
problem
that,
i
suggest,
takes
on
first
amendment
dimensions.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
an
unreasonable
provision,
because
it
would
not
appear
to
be
related
to
safety
or
privacy.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
between
7
p.m.
and
9
p.m.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
thought
you
said,
could
be
made
only
between
7
and
9
p.m.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
well,
i
guess
i
was
thinking
of
it
the
other
way
around.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
that
it
was
more
dangerous
to
entertain
solicitors
after
dark
than
before
dark.
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
that
requirement,
and
it
would
be
a
close
question.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired--
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
yes,
but
only,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
behalf
of
charities;
not--
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
not
on
behalf
of--not
by
the
person
who's
putting
himself
through
college.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
well,
i
won't
comment
on
that.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
because--
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
now,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
is
again
one
of
those
balancing
questions.
we
do
not
permit
the--
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
i
suspect
that
you
would
balance
him
out.
mr.
adam
yarmolinsky
no,
but
the
first
amendment
has
been
restricted--has
been
interpreted
not
to
be
a
completely
unrestricted
opportunity.
after
all,
this
court
doesn't--this
court
permits
individuals
to
put
out
signs
saying,
"don't
talk
to
me.
don't
knock
on
my
door."
that
is
a
restriction
on
the
first
amendment
right,
but
it
is
regarded
as
a
reasonable
restriction.
it
might
be
argued
that
to
deny
tax
exemptions
to
the
contributions
to
an
individual,
as
congress
has
done
except
under
very
limited
circumstances,
is
a
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
don't
think
that
challenge
will
get
very
far.
