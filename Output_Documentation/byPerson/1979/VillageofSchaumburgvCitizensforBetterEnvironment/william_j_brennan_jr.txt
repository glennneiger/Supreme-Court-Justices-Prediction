so,
mr.
yarmolinski,
you
would
say
that
if
the
ordinance
requires
proof
that
some
of
the
money
went
to
the
purported
charitable
purposes,
it
would
still
be
invalid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
it
gets
into
the--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
you
say
about
an
ordinance
that
totally
prohibited
charitable
solicitation
in
the
village?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
think
that
ordinance
would
be
valid,
in
other
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
girl
scouts
cookies,
apparently.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
the
girl
scouts
can
solicit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
they
comply
with
the
ordinance,
though,
because
they've
got
to
pay
for
the
cookies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
would
be
administrative
expenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
you
make
an
exception
for
them?
