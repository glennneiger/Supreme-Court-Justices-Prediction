justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
siegel,
is
this
ordinance
typical
of
villages
in
northern
illinois?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
guys
by
national
organizations,
like
boy
scouts,
red
cross--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
like
-
are
they
subject
to
this
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
they
have
met
the
75
percent
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
your
argument
be
any
different
if
it
were
90
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it--i
take
it
from
reading
this
ordinance
that
it
wouldn't
apply
at
all
to
an
organization
that
came
in
and
said,
"we
want
to
go
door-to-door,
but
we
aren't
the
least
bit
interested
in
raising
any
money.
we
just
never
solicit
contributions."
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
go
door
to
door,
and
put
out
the
word
about
the
environment
or
anything
else
as
much
as
you
want
to
without
any
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
applies
only
to
the
act
of
raising
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
apply.
certainly,
i
suppose
it
would
apply.
because
that's
what
normally
happens.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
effective,
if
those
are
your
aims,
to
require
anybody
who
wants
to
raise
money
from
any
of
your
citizens
to
have
written
down
on
a
little
card
what
percentage
of
its
budget
it
spends
for
this,
that
or
the
other
thing?
and
let
the
householder
make
up
his
mind
whether
that
makes
any
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that--do
you
think
that
raising
money,
purely
raising
money,
is
in
any
case
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment?
do
you
think
there
are
any
first
amendment
considerations
here
at
all
if
all
you're
talking
about
is
the
pure
solicitation
of
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
had
some
opinions--cases
in
this
court
to
contend
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
people
going
around--how
about
religious
organizations
going
around
asking
for
contributions,
and
selling
a
piece
of
literature?
all
they
do
is
sell
and
raise
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
where
they
do--is
it
clear
in
those
cases
that
they
were
doing
something
besides
raising
money
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
spreading
the
gospel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
do
that
without
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
siegel,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
the
ordinance
itself
to
explain
how
the
village
fathers
came
up
with
the
figure,
75
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
same
restriction
as--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
your
ordinance
does
not
allow?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
keep
people
out
that
the
state
would
regard
as
proper
charities.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
did
you
know
at
the
time
you
fixed
the
75
percent?
that's
what
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
you
wouldn't
be
interfering
with
legitimate
solicitation
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
to
get
the
highest
figure
you
could
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
an
ordinance
says
that--a
city
doesn't
say
you
can't
canvass
and
spread
your
ideas;
you
can
spread
them
all
you
want
to.
but
it
says
you
just
can't
raise
money
door
to
door.
raise
it
any
other
way,
by
the
mail
or
by
meetings;
do
it
any
way
you
want
to.
but
just
stay
away
from
doors
in
raising
money.
now,
you
say
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional
to
say,
stay
away
from
all
the
doors
that
have
signs
on
them
"stay
away."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
any
cases
that
say
that
raising
money
is
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
you're
changing
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
thing
this
ordinance
applies
to
is
the
raising
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't--it
doesn't
prevent
spreading
the
word.
where
is
the
authority
for
the
fact
that
raising
money
is
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
anyone
of
those
cases
that
involved
only
solicitation.
in
those
cases,
if
you
wanted
to
go
around
and
canvass
or
solicit,
you
had
to
get
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
forbid
the
people
trying
to
sell
magazines
from
door
to
door?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you--can
you
prevent
the
selling
of
stocks
from
door
to
door?
securities?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
before
the
court
is
an
ordinance
that
forbids
only
solicitation
for
money;
talk
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
really
the
basis
on
which
the
ordinance
is
sought
to
be
justified
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
the
argument
about
the
75
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
short,
if
instead
of
75
percent
the
ordinance
said,
at
least
some,
it
would
be
equally
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
also
be
invalid,
in
any
event.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
thought
it's
violating
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
posting?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
say--if
i
went
around
and
said,
i'm--you
know,
i'm
the
boy
next
door,
i
want
to
go
to
college,
would
you
make
a
small
donation.
or,
you
know
me,
i
work
down
at
the
filling
station,
and
i've
got
a--i've
written
a
heck
of
a
book
and
i
want
to
publish
it.
how
about
helping
me
out.
i'm
just
raising
money
to
publish
my
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
answer's
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
there's--and
you'd
say
anybody
who
came--would
certainly
have
protection
if
he
came
and
said,
"by
the
way,
i
want
to
run
for
office.
how
about
five
dollars?"
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
fellow
who
says,
"i
want
to
run
for
office
or
i
want
to
go
to
college,
and
help
me
along;
i
have
a
few
magazines
i'm
selling."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
he's
trying
to
achieve
the
very
same
ends.
instead
of
asking
for
a
gift,
he's
asking
for
a--he's
going
to
give
you
something
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
matter
with
the
individual
who's
putting
himself
through
college?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
getting
money
to
publish
his
book.
he
thinks
he
will
really
educate
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
balance
him
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
schaumburg
case
which
has
comes
here
from
the
seventh
circuit
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
village
of
schaumburg
in
cook
county
forbids
door
to
door
solicitation
by
charitable
organizations
unless
the
organization
spends
at
least
75%
of
its
receipts
on
charitable
purposes
which
are
defined
to
exclude
salaries,
solicitation
expenses,
overhead
and
other
administrative
expenses.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
decided
that
both
held
that
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
unduly
interfered
with
the
communication
of
information
and
ideas
by
charitable
organizations.
we
agree
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
filed
an
opinion
stating
at
some
length
our
reasons
for
--
for
this
conclusion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
