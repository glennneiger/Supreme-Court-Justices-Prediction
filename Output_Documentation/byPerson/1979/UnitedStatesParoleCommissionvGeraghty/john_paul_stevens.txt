mr.
jones,
would
this
case
become
moot
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
paroled
before
the
certification
question
had
been
decided
in
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
it's
before
or
after
sort
of
--
either
--
either
before
certification
or
after
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
certified
be
the
same
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
are
you
saying
this,
so
i
get
your
point
that
if
in
this
case,
the
district
judge
had
ordered
the
man
paroled
and
the
government
had
acquiesced
in
the
order
and
said
we
won't
appeal
then
it
would
not
have
been
moot?
would
that
be
a
different
case?
did
someone
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
legally
--
is
it
different
in
any
significant
respect
and
if
not,
why
are
you
laboring
the
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice

opinion.
you
let
him
out
and
you
don't
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
--
wouldn't
then
the
case
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
roper
case
because
you're
distinguishing
roper
on
the
ground
that
here,
the
parole
came
without
a
court
order
and
i
say
well,
suppose
we
had
a
court
order,
what
--
why
would
it
be
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
the
bank
in
turn
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
wants
to
maintain
his
class
action
and
the
same
thing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
as
geraghty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
(voice

go
out
of
jail
by
making
the
litigation
going.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
neither
--
in
neither
case
are
they
settling
the
class
aspects
of
the
claim,
but
they're
settling
everything
else,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
either
roper
or
geraghty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
that
geraghty
is
modified
by
saying
he
gets
out
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
are
you
relying
on
the
nonexistence
of
a
court
order?
is
that
critically
your
case?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
correct
there
wasnâ€˜t
mr.
jones
that
the
parole
commission
test
has
no
weight
whatsoever,
to
the
sentence
given
by
the
trial
judge
and
its
not
a
factor
at
all
in
its
forms,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
--
only
to
the
extent
that
imposes
either
a
minimum
or
a
maximum
