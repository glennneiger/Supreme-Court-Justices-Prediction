justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
one
of
his
claims,
but
he
had
two
claims,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he's
claimed
class
action
too,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
a
claim?
justice
thurgood
marshall
less
--
less
in
argue,
you
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
personal
claim
for
himself
expired.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
his
claim
for
--
to
represent
the
class
didn't
expire,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
all
he
has
to
it
buy
more
one
at
a
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
--
they
considered
--
one
word,
they
didn't
accept
it,
but
he
and
the
man
did
accept
it
because
he
couldn't
[laughs]
accept
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
parole,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
i
just
couldn't
--
you
keep
relying
on
this
claim.
he
--
that
he
only
had
one
claim.
i
want
to
see
if
i'm
right
that
he
started
out
with
two
claims.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
started
with
two
alligations,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
in
any
class
action
case,
all
you
have
to
do
is
settle
with
the
individual
party
and
they'll
knock
out
the
class
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
(voice
overlap)
true,
if
not
the
end
of
class
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
ought
to
be
the
case
--
a
very
old
case
of
hansberry
against
lee
whereas
the
court
said,
"you
couldn't
do
that
way
back."
it
was
in
the
1940s.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
you
are
going
into
ancient
history.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
jones,
your
difference
is
not
--
that
if
they
had
rushed
up
the
period
for
parole
would
be
at
one
thing,
but
this
was
just
normal
parole.
isn't
that
what
your
point
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
--
the
point
is
it
wasn't
done
for
the
benefit
of
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he's
not
the
(inaudible)
between
that
and
roper
and
in
any
other
case.
he
didn't
do
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
now,
he
couldn't
file
any
kind
of
lawsuit,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
how
he
stands
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
that's
a
different
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
right
now,
he
can't
file
anything,
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
it
personally,
i
said
any
kind.
he
couldn't
file
a
class
action
either,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
couldn't
anywhere
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
but
he
can
--
he
can
argue
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
argue
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
argue
in
any
of
the
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
as
of
now,
how
could
he
argue
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
can
he
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
he
can't
file
any
now,
can't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
you
have
one
of
them
to
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why'd
you
have
another
one
to
intervene?
you
see
you've
got
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
--
did
you
ask
us
to
let
them
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
and
the
alternative,
i
missed
the
alternative.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
my
point
(inaudible)
