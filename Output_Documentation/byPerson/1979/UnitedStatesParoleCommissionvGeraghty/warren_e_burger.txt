mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed
when

ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
irrational
to
refer
back
to
the
roper?
would
it
be
irrational
for
roper
to
claim
that
he
does
have
a
continuing
economic
interest
--
economic
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
the
class
action
because
if
there
was
no
class
action
ever
allowed,
the
expensive
litigation
falls
on
him,
whereas
if
he
can
get
10,000
or
90,000
people
in,
the
expense
litigation
is
going
to
be
spread
and
he
won't
have
to
pay
so
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
relating
that
this
case,
would
geraghty's
situation
be
any
better
if
there
were
injunctive
relief
with
respect
to
the
class
action
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
either
out
or
he's
in.
chief
justice

court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

well,
mr.

mr.
flaxman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
can
the
judicial
branch
do
for
mr.
geraghty
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
my
question.
what
can
the
judicial
branch
do
for
mr.
geraghty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
where
do
--
where
do
we
find
this
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
an
offer
of
proof
to
this
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
i'm
--
i
don't
understand
why
we
should
consider
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
--
the

the
full
amount
of
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
the
traditional
way
people
become
parties
to
lawsuits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
in
--
you're
expressing
an
opinion
now,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jones,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
prisoners
who
in
this
setting,
sentenced
for
five
years
maximum,
who
maybe
kept
in
prison
for
longer
than
five
years
by
action
of
the
parole
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
fixing
the
sentence
is
the
absolute
maximum
of
confinement,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.

case

submitted.
