would
be
easier
for
you,
if
we
overrule
mcdonald?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
don't
want
to
go
on
record
with
that.
you
were
reluctant
to
express
something
about
roper
and
that
it
seems
to
me,
you've
been
talking
about
roper
under
the
court's
question
to
the
last
15
minutes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you're
--
you're
in
bet
with
roper
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
i'm
afraid.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case,
us
parole
commission
against
geraghty
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
geraghty
was
a
federal
prisoner
and
he
was
twice
denied
parole.
he
brought
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
challenging
the
validity
of
the
united
states
parole
commission's
parole
release
guidelines.
he
purported
to
represent
a
class
of
all
federal
prisoners
eligible
for
release.
the
trial
court
refused
to
certify
the
class
and
gave
judgment
for
the
defendants
on
the
merits.
geraghty
appealed
and
while
that
appeal
was
pending,
he
was
released
from
prison.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
his
did
not
render
the
case
moot.
it
went
on
to
hold
that
class
certification
would
not
be
inappropriate
and
it
therefore
reversed
the
denial
of
class
certification.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
a
purported
class
action
does
not
become
moot
upon
the
expiration
of
the
named
plaintiff's
substantive
claim
even
though
class
certification
has
been
denied.
and
this
is
because
the
representative
of
the
purported
class
retains
a
personal
stake
in
obtaining
a
class
certification
sufficient
to
assure
the
maintenance
of
the
case
or
controversy
standard
required
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
we
therefore
approve
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
except
for
its
ruling
that
the
burden
of
constructing
subclasses
was
on
the
district
court.
it
is
our
view
that
that
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk.
i'm
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
