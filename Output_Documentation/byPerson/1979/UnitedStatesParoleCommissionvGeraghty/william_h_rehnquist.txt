justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
an
allegation
of
$10,000
in
dispute
in
this
case
for
jurisdictional
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
the
plaintiff's
prayed
for
subclass
certification
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
raised
it
to
sua
sponte?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
roper,
mr.
jones,
the
plaintiff
had
written
a
letter
to
the
bank
before
suit
saying,
"i
claim
$15,000
and
if
you
don't
pay
me
off,
i'm
going
to
bring
a
class
action
for
myself
and
on
a
bunch
of
other
people"
and
the
bank
replied,
"here
is
a
check
for
$15,000."
and
the
plaintiff
nonetheless
went
in
to
district
court
and
filed
an
action
saying,
"i've
got
my
$15,000,"
but
the
class
action
hasn't
been
settled.
would
the
--
would
the
district
court
have
any
jurisdiction
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
class
action
aspect
had
existed
separate
and
apart
from
a
live
controversy
as
to
some
substantive
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps,
this
court
gave
you
no
choice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
that
analysis,
you
could
be
the
named
plaintiff
just
as
well
as
mr.
geraghty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
is
some
sort
of
a
bridge-crossing
at
some
stage
rather
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
class
which
he's
--
which
he
described
as
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
that
they
had
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
would
not
be
a
proper
class.
