justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
if
there
--
if
the
class
have
been
certified
and
then
it
--
it
had
become,
"moot"
that
the
case
would
have
gone
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
sosna
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
if
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
had
just
happened
to
break
up
its
decision
in
two
parts
and
as
the
very
--
and
as
the
very
--
and
as
the
very
first
opinion
that
wrote,
it
reversed
the
class
action.
this
is
before
--
before
there
had
been
a
parole
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
suppose
that
the
court
had
decided
that
the
class
action
decision
was
wrong
and
then
he
was
paroled,
then
it
would
be
franks,
i
suppose
or
sosna.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that's
what
the
--
what
the
result,
was.
how
about
--
how
about
your
position?
is
your
position
in
this
case
really
consistent
with
that?
wouldn't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
--
i
don't
understand
how
it
can
be
really.
this
one
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
feel
which
should
decide
roper?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
interest
of
--
what
interest
did
the
named
party
had
after
judgement?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
been
a
certified
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
did
--
he
didn't
have
any
interest
himself,
except
in
--
to
continue
the
class
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
just
--
tell
me
--
well,
just
tell
me
what
the
interest
was
in
mcdonald
or
in
roper
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
other
than
--
other
than
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
other
than
the
class
part
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
roper?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
--
but
his
only
interest
after
judgement,
was
the
class
aspect
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
so,
his
--
his
interest
was
measured
by
the
class
aspect
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
this
case,
how
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
still
had
a
very
solid
interest
in
maintaining
and
pushing
the
class
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
one
in
roper.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
claim,
his
own
claim
had
been
extinguished.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
question
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
before
you
leave
the
mootness,
i
take
that
your
position
would
be
the
same
here
if
--
if
this
case
didn't
involve
this
kind
of
a
claim,
but
involved
the
roper
kind
of
a
claim
that
the
--
that
the
roper
case
became
moot
on
appeal.
say
--
say
that
there
had
been
an
appeal,
a
proper
appeal
and
that
they
had
settled
with
him
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
roper
--
roper
just
took
his
money
and
--
and
that
--
that
the
order
denying
the
class
certification,
not
yet
been
reversed,
roper
is
just
paid
off
and
he
accepted
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
everybody
--
everybody
agrees
that
--
no
one
claims
that
the
roper
would
have
any
for
himself,
hasn't
anymore
claimed.
his
only
interest,
remaining
interest
is
in
the
class
aspect
of
the
suit.
would
you
say
that
that
case
might
not
be
moot
and
yet
yours
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
his
pocket
then,
might
be
an
example
to
you,
it's
in
his
pocket.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
they
settle
with
him
and
pay
him
and
--
and
he
says,
"yes,
that's
all
the
money
i'm
entitled
to."
but
now,
let's
just
remember,
we're
going
to
continue
the
class
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
pursue
the
class
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
you
think,
geraghty
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
worn-out.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
my
example
of
you
--
in
my
example
of
you,
there
was
nothing
left
to
adjudicate
on
roper's
claim
in
my
example
i
just
gave
you,
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
would
think
you
were
to
say
on
that
basis,
how
--
how
come
sosna
or
how
come
mcdonald,
the
class
aspect
of
the
case
survive?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
disappearance
of
the
name
that
was
claimed.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
party
left
in
roper
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
--
you
say,
they
can
do
for
him.
this
is
what
they
could
do
for
him,
if
the
class
had
been
certified
prior
to
his
parole?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
lose
this
case,
it
just
means
that
some
other
member
of
the
class
can
sue,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case
anyway,
you've
lost
a
filing
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
roper
type
case,
it
maybe
that
people
are
foreclosed
by
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
there's
no
problem
about
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
could
--
or
you
might
have
had
five
or
six
named
plaintiffs
to
start
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
wanted
--
as
you
wanted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
--
and
are
these
people
indigent?
you
didn't
file
--
pay
filing
fees
anyway,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
brought
the
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
