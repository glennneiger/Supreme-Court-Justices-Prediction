mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
being
argued
in
tandem
with
deposit
guaranty
national
bank
against
roper,
in
which
the
court
just
heard
argument.
in
this
case,
as
with
the
petitioners
in
roper,
we
contend
that
the
case
became
moot
upon
the
expiration
of
the
named
plaintiff's
claim
after
the
district
court
denied
the
request
for
class
certification,
but
the
facts
of
this
case
differ
from
those
of
roper.
respondent
geraghty
initiated
this
action
in
1976,
while
he
was
serving
a
two
and
one
half-year
criminal
sentence
in
federal
prison.
he
contended
that
the
parole
guidelines
that
are
used
by
the
united
states
parole
commission
in
determining
whether
and
when
the
release
of
prisoner
on
parole
are
invalid
under
the
parole
commission
and
reorganization
act
and
under
the
constitution.
he
moved
to
have
the
case
certified
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
federal
prisoners
who
have
been
or
will
become
eligible
for
parole.
the
district
court
denied
the
request
for
class
certification,
noting
that
the
proposed
class
was
too
broad
because
not
all
federal
prisoners
share
respondent's
claims
in
common.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
was
not
an
alligation
of
--
of
$10,000
in
controversy.
he
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
commission
under
28
u.s.c.
1331.
the
court
then
rejected
respondent's
legal
claims
on
the
merits
and
granted
summary
judgement
to
the
commission.
respondent
appealed,
but
while
his
appeal
was
pending,
he
was
released
from
federal
prison
at
the
expiration
of
his
criminal
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
although
respondent's
legal
claims
became
moot
upon
his
release
from
prison,
the
case
was
not
moot.
the
court
reasoned
that
if
the
proposed
class
was
certifiable
and
the
court
thought
that
it
was
because
of
a
possible
use
of
subclasses,
then
the
case
can
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
class
certification
and
then
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
class.
and
the
court
also
reversed
the
award
of
summary
judgement
for
the
commission
ruling
that
under
respondent's
alligations,
the
guidelines
may
conflict
with
statutory
parole
criteria
and
create
an
ex
post
facto
enhancement
of
punishment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
neither
in
the
district
court
nor
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
plaintiff
contended
that
the
proposed
class
was
not
too
broad.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
that
and
in
--
and
itself
constructed
the
subclass
theory.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it
sua
sponte.
now,
we
sought
certiorari
on
four
questions
and
i'll
discuss
two
of
those
at
this
time.
first,
whether
the
case
became
moot
upon
respondent's
release
from
prison.
second,
whether
the
parole
commission
and
guidelines
are
invalid
under
the
parole
commission
and
reorganization
act,
and
we
rely
on
our
briefs
on
the
remaining
issues.
this
court
has
ruled
on
several
occasions
that
there
is
no
constitutional
case
or
controversy,
unless
there
exists
at
each
stage
of
the
litigation,
an
actual
dispute
between
adverse
parties.
and
because
of
that,
in
jacobs,
pasadena
and
kremens,
the
court
has
held
that
a
case
becomes
moot
if
at
the
time
the
claim
of
the
named
litigant
becomes
moot,
there
is
no
properly
certified
class
that
can
succeed
as
a
party
to
the
adversary
position
in
the
litigation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
be
equally
moot.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
matters
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
what
matters
is
at
the
time
his
claim
became
moot,
there
was
no
properly
certified
class
that
could
come
into
the
case
as
a
party
to
the
adversary
position
in
the
litigation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
so
that
under
franks
against
bowman
transportation
company.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
also,
under
sosna.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
the
class
was
certified,
it
would
be
a
franks
or
a
sosna.
it's
--
this
court
hasn't
decided
whether
a
court
of
appeals
can
certify
a
class.
it
reserved
the
question
in
east
texas
motor
freight
against
rodriguez,
but
the
facts
of
this
case
wasn't
--
no
class
was
certified.
the
respondent
was
released
from
prison
while
the
appeal
was
pending
and
it
was
after
he
was
released
from
prison
that
the
court
of
appeals
entered
its
judgement.
well,
under
kremens,
jacobs
and
pasadena,
there
are
two
separate
inquiries
and
the
first
is
whether
at
any
time
in
this
litigation,
respondent's
claims
became
moot
and
there's
really
no
dispute
about
that
in
this
case.
this
court
has
already
decided
the
issue
in
weinstein
against
bradford.
it
held
that
a
prisoner's
claims
challenging
parole
procedures
become
moot
upon
his
release
from
prison,
but
the
situation
maybe
different
in
the
case
where
a
prevalent
plaintiff
is
seeking
review
of
the
judgement.
it
would
make
no
sense
to
say
that
a
--
a
plaintiff's
claim
is
made
moot
by
the
entry
of
judgement
in
the
district
court.
the
prevailing
plaintiff
has
standing
both
to
enforce
his
claim,
his
judgement
and
he
also
retains
standing
in
some
situations
to
seek
collateral
relief
that
was
denied
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
for
this
reason,
that
in
coopers
&
lybrand
and
united
airlines
against
mcdonald,
the
court
assumed
that
whether
a
plaintiff
wins
or
loses
in
district
court,
he
retains
standing
to
review
the
denial
of
class
certification.
it's
--
the
judgement
in
the
case
didn't
make
it
moot.
the
question
after
judgement
is
entered
is
whether
the
plaintiff
obtained
all
the
relief
he
requested
on
his
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
our
position
is
that
this
case
is
different
from
that.
our
case
is
different
because
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
let
me
illustrate
by
com
--
by
comparing
the
facts
of
roper.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
roper,
the
case
that
we're
just
arguing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
question
in
roper
would
seem
to
be
whether
in
the
context
of
that
case,
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
made
the
case
moot.
the
tender
didn't
make
the
case
moot.
it
was
simply
an
offer
to
settle.
it
was
not
accepted
by
the
--
by
the
respondent.
what
happened
after
the
tender
was
rejected
was
that
the
district
court
entered
an
order
saying
that
you're
entitled
to
these
damages.
and
that
--
and
then
the
question
that
--
that
remains
for
the
court
is
whether
that
judgement
--
is
whether
the
respondent
in
that
context
has
standing
to
appeal
the
judgment
to
raise
the
collateral
issues
on
which
he
was
denied
relief
in
the
district
court.
our
case
is
different
from
that.
the
respondent's
claim
in
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
would
--
i'm
reluctant
to
--
to
indicate
the
result,
but
i
think
the
question
there
in
roper
is
whether
--
is
whether
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
mooted
the
case,
but
the
question
in
--
that's
not
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
roper?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
he
had
--
he
had
the
same
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
had
the
same
interest
that
this
court
hypothesized,
would
exist
in
united
airlines
against
mcdonald
and
in
coopers
and
lybrand.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
some
context,
the
plaintiff
will
have
an
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
i
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
--
i'd
like
to
start
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
--
in
mcdonald,
the
--
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
the
class
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
thought
you're
giving
me
a
choice.
in
roper,
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
damages
that
would
(voice
overlap)
that
would
enhance
in
total
sum,
if
class
relief
is
available.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
the
benefit
that
he
would
obtain
from
having
a
class
claim
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
distinction
in
this
case
is
that
the
respondent's
claims
expired
without
the
benefit
of
any
district
court
decision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
may
have
had
an
interest
in
pushing
it,
but
he
didn't
have
a
live
claim.
his
claim
had
been
extinct
by
this
wholly
outside
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
the
question
in
roper,
is
whether
the
judgement
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
question
is
a
little
different
in
the
two
cases,
although
the
ultimate
question
is
the
same,
whether
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
moot.
in
our
--
in
geraghty,
we
contend
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
moot
because
it
was
extinguished
by
events
wholly
apart
from
the
litigation.
weinstein
and
jacobs,
pasadena,
these
are
all
those
types
of
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
--
it
would
be
different
from
the
case
we
have.
i'm
not
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
even
under
mancusi
against
stubbs,
it
depends
on
i
think,
in
part
on
how
we
acquiesce
in
the
claim.
if
we
simply
acquiesce
in
it,
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
complying
with
this
court's
order
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
we
don't
appeal,
then
the
--
you're
asking
whether
he
can
appeal?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
distinction
i
suppose
between
that
case
and
roper
is
that
after
the
order
was
entered,
the
government
by
your
hypothetical,
in
effect,
settled
its
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
--
but
the
bank
wants
to
settle
the
claim,
but
roper
never
accepted
the
tender.
the
money
is
still
in
the
district
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
the
different
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
difference
is
that
if
--
if
the
claim
is
in
fact
settled,
that
raises
a
whole
new
different
--
a
whole
different
question
of
mootness.
this
court
noted
in
indianapolis
employment
commission
against
burney
that
settlement
of
a
claim
often
moots
the
controversy.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by,
in
either
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
geraghty,
there
was
no
settlement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
maybe
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
question
really
is
--
is
what
--
in
roper,
the
question
is
what
the
bank's
relying
on.
we're
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
claim
expired
before
any
relief
was
entered.
so,
we
don't
have
to
decide
like
in
roper
whether
the
relief
was
all
that
was
sought.
here,
the
claim
expired
before
any
relief
could
be
given.
a
--
a
prisoner
whose
claim
has
expired
is
not
entitled
to
seek
coercive
relief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
he
--
the
claim
that
he
had
that
expired
was
--
was
his
claim
which
was
up
to
that
--
that
point,
the
only
claim
that
he
was
the
only
party
in
the
case
who
could
raise
any
claim.
when
his
personal
claim
expired
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
sought
his
class
certification.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
alright,
it's
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--
he
--
he
sought
that
additional
relief,
but
his
claim
expired
before
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
--
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
he
couldn't
service
the
class
representative.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
under
sosna
against
iowa,
the
court
noted
there
has
to
be
a
prisoner
and
--
not
a
prisoner,
there
has
to
be
a
plaintiff
with
a
live
claim
at
the
time
of
class
certification.
he
didn't
have
a
live
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
parole
commission
didn't
buy
anybody
off.
we
released
him
at
the
expiration
of
his
criminal
sentence.
i
don't
know
whether
the
bank
in
roper,
is
really
in
the
situation
where
they
were
buying
people
off.
i
--
as
i
understand
the
facts,
there,
the
bank
tendered
the
judgement
seven
months
after
class
certification
was
denied,
but
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
a
point
that
is
critical
that
you've
raised
is
that
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
he
may
have
stared
with
two
claims,
although
i
don't
know
if
i
would
phrase
it
that
way,
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
after
his
individual
claim
became
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
alright.
after
his
initial
--
after
his
original
claim
became
moot,
he
couldn't
service
the
class
representative.
this
court's
already
decided
that
in

against

requires
a
class
representative
with
a
live
claim
and
the
case
or
controversy
clause
requires
that
an
actual
dispute
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
--
it's
possible
we
noted
about
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
noted
in
our
brief
that
it's
possible
to
--
to
say
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--
that
if
a
--
if
a
defendant
undertakes
a
series
of
actions
in
which
he
immediately
pays
off
class
representatives'
claims
before
certification,
it's
possible
that
the
case
could
be
viewed
like
gerstein
against
pugh
that
entered
the
mootness
of
the
claim
was
inevitably
intervening
before
even
the
class
certification
order
could
be
ruled
on.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
--
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
well,
we
don't
dispute
that
in
any
event
because
here,
the
--
the
plaintiff's
claim
became
moot,
well,
after
the
judgment
--
the
class
certification
motion
was
ruled
on.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
also,
there
will
be
injunctive
situations
where
the
class
representative's
injunctive
relief
will
be
made
better,
if
other
members
of
his
class
also
obtain
injunctive
relief.
a
title

prospective

(voice

mr.
kent
l.
jones
his
relief
would
be
unaffected.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
the
nature
of
the
parole
relief
that
he
requests.
the
fact
relied
on
the
court
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
class
action
may
have
been
certifiable,
was
irrelevant
for
two
reasons.
one,
we've
already
discussed
the
action
wasn't
certifiable
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
respondent's
claim
was
moot.
he
couldn't
serve
as
the
class
representative.
there
was
no
other
litigant
in
the
court
who
could
have
served
as
the
class
representative,
the
class
who
thus
--
was
thus,
not
certifiable.
but
more
importantly,
there
has
to
be
an
actual
dispute
between
adverse
parties
at
each
stages
of
litigation,
the
fact
that
other
parties
could
have
been
added
by
intervention
or
class
certification
while
respondent
retained
his
live
claim,
doesn't
alter
the
fact
that
they
were
not.
it's
a
hypothetical
or
a
potential
controversy
that
doesn't
create
a
constitutional
case.
and
because
the
case
became
moot
when
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court
too,
has
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
a
motion
to
intervene
or
add
parties
by
class
certification.
federal
courts
have
no
power
to
exercise
in
moot
cases
other
than
to
remand
to
their
courts
below
for
the
judgements
to
be
vacated
and
we
submit
that's
the
appropriate
disposition
in
this
case.
but
if
the
case
is
not
moot,
we
think
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
should
have
been
affirmed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
they
had
settled
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
settlement
manifested
an
intention
to
--
for
all
claims
to
be
ended.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
that
that's
--
that
issue
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
mcdonald
in
its
footnote,
when
it
noted
that
a
settlement
is
not
necessarily
always
intended
to
extinguish
the
plaintiff's
right
to
appeal.
the
court
assumed
on
the
facts
of
mcdonald
that
that
settlement
didn't
have
that
effect.
it
emphasized
that
the
--
the
plaintiffs
who
settled
had
already
obtained
summary
judgement
on
their
claims.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
his
--
that
his
personal
claim
is
moot,
by
the
fact
that
he's
had
a
favorable
judgement.
this
court
--
he
retains
standing
to
enforce
the
judgement
for
one
thing.
he
also
retains
standing
under
the
court's
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
--
if
he
goes
to
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
and
i
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
under
mcdonald,
he
would
be
entitled
to
seek
such
a
settlement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
--
that's
in
effect,
what
happened
in
mcdonald.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
geraghty
is
different
because
he
hasn't
settled
his
claim.
we
--
we're
not
--
this
case
doesn't
turn
on
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
his
claim
expired.
it
hasn't
--
it
can't
be
adjudicated.
the
question
in
roper
is
whether
after
claim
is
adjudicated,
the
plaintiff
got
everything
he
wanted.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
this
case,
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
he
can
take
to
federal
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
i
wouldn't
agree
with
you
that
that
was
a
settlement
that
extinguished
all
the
claims
that
roper
had
left
to
raise.
all
i'm
saying
is
that,
that
would
then
be
the
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
was
normal
parole.
he
was
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly
not.
he
was
--
his
release
was
simply
when
his
criminal
sentence
expired.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
a
significant
difference
that
we
rely
on.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
he
would.
that
would
be
much
like
our
case
where
the
claim
was
simply
extinguished.
there
was
no
--
the
power
in
the
federal
court
to
adjudicate
his
claim
because
it
--
it
didn't
exist
at
that
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
under
the
rules
of
procedure,
it
can't.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
also
wanted
to
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
sosna,
the
reason
that
it
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--
survived
was
because
a
new
party
had
come
into
the
case.
under
the
court's
analysis,
it
was
the
class
who've
served
as
the
adverse
party.
there's
no
party
left
in
our
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
can't
deny
that
it
would
be
easier
for
us,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
go
on
record
as
saying
that
mcdonald
is
irreconcilable
with
our
position.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
then
let
me
go
on
to
the
merits
of
this
case
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
my
white
lie
hasn't
come
on,
but
should
it
have?
and
i
see
that
i'm
really
close
to
the
end
of
my
time
and
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
word
on
the
merits.
as
i
started
to
say,
the
guidelines
were
adopted
by
the
commission
in
1973.
respondent's
contention
that
the
guidelines
are
invalid
under
the
parole
commission
and
reorganization
act,
we
think,
neglects
the
fact
that
in
1976,
when
congress
enacted
the
legislation,
it
specifically
approved
and
incorporated
the
commission's
preexisting
guidelines
into
this
legislation.
the
conference
committee
report
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
it
states
that
the
act
incorporates
the
preexisting
guidelines
system
into
the
statute
and
makes
its
improvements
a
permanent
part
of
the
commission's
decision-making
process.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
--
i
wanted
to
point
out
again
that
the
respondents'
arguments
basically,
go
to
the
wisdom
and
reasonableness
of
the
parole
guidelines
system
and
senator
burdick
and
the
members
of
the
conference
committee
simply
disagree
on
whether
this
is
a
wise
system.
as
we
note
on
page
65
of
our
brief,
senator
burdick
explained
that
these
were
the
guidelines
that
he
wanted
to
have
promulgate
--
promulgated
under
this
legislation
and
the
conference
committee
reports
and
now
i'll
quote
it,
"the
promulgation
of
guidelines
to
make
parole
less
disparate
and
more
understandable,
has
met
with
such
success
that
this
legislation
incorporates
the
system
into
the
statute."
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals
both
said
that,
perhaps,
the
--
the
final
legislation
didn't
ratify
the
guidelines
because
representative
kastenmeier
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
the
final
legislation
was
a
compromise,
but
to
compromise
is
evidence
simply
by
comparing
4206
(a)
to
4206
(d).
the
house
had
proposed
a
presumptive
parole
provision
under
which
prisoners
would
be
released
after
one
third
of
their
sentence,
unless
there
were
good
reasons
not
to
release
him.
the
senate
on
the
other
hand,
wanted
the
guideline
provision.
the
senate
got
its
way
in
4206
(a)
and
the
house
got
most
of
what
it
wanted
in
4206
(d).
there
is
a
presumptive
release
provision
but
it
applies
after
a
prisoner
serves
two
thirds
of
his
term
and
that
was
the
compromise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
parole
commission
has
no
discretion
to
keep
a
prisoner
in
prison
after
his
sentence
is
expired,
even
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
the
parole
commission
only
exercises
discretion
within
a
period
that
he's
lawfully
held
under
the
sentence.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
not
a
factor
that
the
commission
considers
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
determines
the
eligibility
for
parole
but
it
doesn't
determine
the
commission's
exercise
of
discretion.
