mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mootness
question
in
this
case
is
from
a
practical
standpoint
not
very
significant.
if
the
court
holds
that
this
case
is
moot,
my
clients
who
are
before
this
court,
is
prospective
additional
respondents
or
petitioning
interveners
will
file
a
new
case.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
mr.
geraghty
is
here
on
behalf
of
these
unnamed
members
of
the
potential
class.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh!
he
can
obtain
absolutely
no
additional
personal
relief.
he's
here
representing
these
additional
people,
some
of
whom
have
come
forward
and
identified
themselves
and
authorized
the
attorneys,
mr.
geraghty,
to
proceed
on
their
behalf,
as
they
join
with
mr.
geraghty,
in
believing
that
the
present
system
is
unlawful
and
in
seeking
to
get
a
judicial
vindication
of
--
of
their
rights.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
the
only
relief
that
mr.
geraghty
sought
in
the
class
action
aspect
to
the
complaint,
was
declaratory
judgement
that
the
--
the
system
is
unlawful.
he
sought
individual
relief
to
have
them
enlarged
from
custody
to
preserve
his
claim,
so
that
there'd
be
no
question
of
mootness,
which
is
what
we
have
been
â€“
what's
been
debated
today.
the
--
the
relief
they
wanted
was
a
judgement
on
his
behalf
and
behalf
of
the
class
that
the
system
was
unlawful.
that's
precisely
the
same
relief
that
would
be
obtained
today
or
tomorrow
in
this
case
or
in
a
subsequent
case
challenging
the
same
system.
the
system
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
i've
discussed
with
him
the
possibility
of
returning
to
prison
to
retain
standing
and
he
suggested
that
would
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
his
personal
claim
has
--
hasn't
filed
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
not,
about
the
parole
system.
he's
not
presently
agreed.
he
can
file
--
he
could
not
file
a
new
case,
but
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
but
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
he
can't
continue
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
he
could
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
could
argue
in
the
district
court,
at
the
time
the
action
was
commenced
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
as
of
now,
he's
continuing
to
assert
the
standing
of
the
persons
who
are
presently
in
custody,
who
have
presently
aggrieved
by
the
system.
it's
not
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
he's
not
filing
a
lawsuit
now.
he's
filed
a
lawsuit
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct,
but
he
can
continue
to
defend
through
appeal
the
case
once
it
has
been
filed.
at
the
time
he
filed
a
lawsuit
in
19
--
september
of
1976,
mr.
geraghty
was
in
prison
and
he
had
standing
at
that
point.
at
that
point,
he
was
an
adequate
class
representative.
the
question
which
was
raised
is
to
whether
he
--
the
district
court
could
find
that
mr.
geraghty
could
still
be
an
adequate
representative
really
isn't
dispositive
or
isn't
even
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
this
case
is
moot.
there's
a
continuing
controversy
between
the
members
of
the
potential
class
and
the
parole
commission
about
the
legality
of
the
guidelines.
the
interest
of
those
persons
are
i
think,
adequately
and
vigorously
presented
in
this
court
as
they
were
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
behalf
of
mr.
geraghty.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
not
true.
i
was
never
personally
aggrieved
by
the
guidelines
and
i
did
not
have
standing
at
the
time
the
action
was
commenced
to
bring
the
action.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
think
the
rule
is
at
the
time
the
action
is
commenced,
the
class
representative
must
be
a
member
of
the
class
that
he
seeks
to
represent.
that's
consistent
with
rodriguez
and
that's
what
met
in
this
case
and
mr.
geraghty
was
in
custody,
had
been
denied
parole,
and
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
he
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
that's
--
i
have
been
saying
since
--
in
all
the
briefs
that
the
government
is
misreading
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
--
when
i
read
it,
it
says
that
we
are
not
convinced
--
it
is
not
clear
if
the
class
is
overbroad,
and
that's
question
for
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
says
it
is
overbroad
and
maybe
it
isn't,
then
the
district
court
should
consider
sub-classing,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
it
was
overboard.
it
said
that,
that
is
not
a
reason
to
per
se
deny
class
certification.
so,
i
think
that's
a
misreading
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
when
mr.
geraghty
filed
this
complaint
and
in
answer
to
a
question
posed
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
an
alligation
at
the
jurisdictional
amount,
which
have
been
satisfied
for
each
member
of
the
class,
which
became
unnecessary
on
statutes
meant.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
--
that's
correct.
this
is
actually
the
second
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct
that
we
--
this
actually
is
the
second
case
which
was
filed
to
present
the
same
theories
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
guidelines.
the
first
case
was
various
to
individual
action.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
and
that
became
moot
and
this
was
for
as
a
class
action
to
avoid
that
problem.
we
did
everything
possible
to
obtain
class
certification
which
the
commission
agrees
now,
although
it
disagreed
in
district
court,
but
have
avoided
the
mootness
problem.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
--
i
could've
had
as
many
as
--
the
number
of
our
prisoners.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
these
people
are
anxious
to
--
for
me
to
represent
their
rights
and
obtain
vindication
and
have
--
have
this
court
consider
whether
the
parole
commission
in
making
parole
release
decisions
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
did
have
one
to
intervene.
i
have
one
intervene
in
the
district
court
and
seek
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--
i
have
--
i
think,
13
potential
interveners
in
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
the
motion
that
was
filed
as
the
substitute
respondents
or
in
the
alternative
to
intervene.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
okay,
i've
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
--
and
there
are
--
those
people,
the
original
prospective,
additional
respondent's,
petitioning
interveners,
most
of
them
have
already
satisfied
their
sentences,
so
there
are
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
we're
the
respondent,
we
don't
pay
for
that.
most,
most
of
these
people
are
indigent.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
mr.
geraghty
paid
the
$15
filing
fee
in
the
beginning.
there
were
some
--
the
--
the
indecency
wasn't
raised
in
district
court
and
he
was
able
to
afford
$15
without
depriving
himself
of
the
necessities
of
everyday
life.
but
these
people
won't
believe
that
it's
wrong
to
the
parole
commission
to
resentence
them
once
they
get
to
prison.
i
think
it's
wrong,
for
example,
to
get
a
three-year
sentence
then
go
to
the
parole
board
four
months
after
you're
in
prison
and
to
be
told
that,
you're
never
going
to
be
paroled
because
we
think,
you
should
serve
70
to
85
months
in
prison.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
the
situation
presented
by
mr.
hayes,
as
one
of
the
additional
perspective
respondents.
there's
something
wrong
with
that
system
and
what's
wrong
with
that
system
is
that
it's
contrary
to
what
congress
said
the
parole
commission
should
be
doing,
when
congress
passed
the
1976
act.
the
--
just
to
--
to
backtrack
a
little
bit,
our
basic
claim
in
the
case
is
that
the
guideline
system
is
unlawful,
that
it's
contrary
to
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
the
case
from
the
grant
to
summary
judgment.
resolved,
look
at
the
facts
that
were
in
dispute,
in
the
light,
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
the
potential
class
and
found
that
there
were
several
facts
which
were
material
to
its
theory,
which
could
not
be
decided
on
the
present
record.
the
first
is
what
way
that's
given
to
institutional
behavior
in
parole
release
decisions.
we
allege
that
that
is
not
a
factor
in
parole
release
decisions.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
government
disputed
that
in
their
answer
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
question
can
only
be
disposed
off
on
a
full
record.
we
expect
to
show
in
the
district
court
that
as
the
parole
commission's
information
reveals
and
perhaps
3%
of
all
cases
is
a
decision
made
to
depart
from
its
guidelines
because
of
institutional
behavior.
what
the
parole
commission
guidelines
consist
of
is
a
chart
which
contains
customary
lines
from
prisoners
for
various
categories
of
offenses.
the
categories
are
unrelated
to
the
sentence
which
was
imposed
or
to
the
sentence
which
could
have
been
imposed.
it's
possible
to
be
sentenced
for
an
offense
which
is
punishable
by
not
more
than
five
years
in
prison,
but
come
up
on
the
parole
commission
with
an
offense
which
should've
--
which
requires
you
to
serve
70
to
85
months
in
prison.
the
--
the
table
of
the
--
of
the
guidelines
is
this
matrix,
which
consists
of
offense
severity
levels
and
salient
factor
scores.
the
--
our
allegations
and
we
expect
to
show
in
the
district
court,
the
way
in
which
a
parole
release
decision
is
made,
is
that
within
four
months
after
someone's
in
prison,
they
got
a
parole
hearing.
at
that
parole
hearing,
two
hearing
examiners
sit
down
and
look
at
these
guidelines
to
re-rate
the
severity
of
a
prisoner's
offense.
they
don't
look
at
the
sentence
which
was
imposed.
they
don't
look
at
the
sentence
which
could've
been
imposed.
they
look
at
how
this
prisoner
matches
up
on
their
score.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
we
were
entitled
to
summary
judgment
on
that
allegation
that
we
would
have
to
prove
it
and
i
think
we
can
prove
that
easily,
if
we
can
get
these
individual
decisions.
but
on
this
record,
i
think
the
court
has
to
view
the
record,
the
same
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
light
of
most
favorable
to
us,
as
if
we
had
proved
this.
once
the
parole
commission
has
re-rated
the
severity
of
the
prisoner's
offense,
they
compute
his
salient
factor
score.
the
salient
factor
score
goes
from
0
to
11
and
awards
points
for
various
things
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
statistically
significant
in
post-release
behavior
of
some
prisoners.
the
--
once
those
two
scales
are
computed,
the
hearing
examiners
look
at
the
chart
and
see
what
the
customary
length
of
imprisonment
could
be.
then
there's
a
judgment
made
as
to
whether
a
decision
should
be
made
to
depart
from
those
guidelines.
we
--
at
the
hearing,
we
had
in
the
district
court
following
remand,
we
discovered
that
the
parole
commission
has
meetings
periodically
of
its
hearing
examiners,
which
we
expect
the
evidence
to
show,
is
to
keep
them
in
line,
to
make
sure
that
they
depart
from
the
guidelines
as
in
frequently
as
possible.
what
they
do
is
to
keep
score,
keep
track
of
how
many
decisions
each
hearing
examiner
makes
outside
of
the
guidelines
and
then
to
hold
meetings
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
going
to
come
out
on
remand.
i'm
just
trying
to
explain
what
we
would
prove.
that
the
government
contends
that
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
there
was
a
hearing
held
following
remand
on
the
class
certification
question
and
that
came
out
of
that
hearing.
this
was
following
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
government's
petition,
writ
for
certiorari
was
--
was
filed.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
the
government
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--
represents
in
this
court
that
we
use
our
judgment
in
making
individual
parole
release
decisions
and
i'm
making
these
representations
to
make
it
clear
to
this
court
that
we
expect
the
evidence
to
show
exactly
the
opposite
in
a
district
court
and
that
the
court
should
not
accept
the
government's
representations
which
have
not
been
the
subject
of
a
reliable
fact-finding
in
the
district
court.
that's
the
--
the
statistics
which
are
in
the
record,
are
that
in,
i
think
1977,
6%
of
prisoners
who
were
released
before
they
had
served
the
customary
lengths
of
imprisonment.
the
customary
lengths
of
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
the
--
a
prisoner
gets
a
sentence
from
the
judge.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
let's
say,
the
judge
gives
him
a
five-year
sentence.
he
then
goes
to
the
parole
commission
and
they
say,
"we
think
you
should
do
70
to
85
months
in
prison.
we
see
no
reason
to
make
a
decision
outside
of
that
customary
range
of
imprisonment.
therefore,
parole
will
be
denied
and
you'll
be
continued
to
expiration,"
which
means,
generally
that
the
prisoner
will
serve
those
five
years
that
the
judge
gave
him,
less
time
off
for
good
behavior.
the
parole
commission
doesn't
consider
of
a
sentence
which
is
given.
for
i
think
25%
of
all
prisoners
that
customary
length
of
imprisonment,
the
new
sentence
to
get
from
the
parole
board
is
more
than
they've
got
from
the
judge.
and
for
another
25%
of
all
prisoners,
what
the
parole
board
wants
to
do
is
to
release
them
before
they
even
become
eligible
for
parole.
this
is
only
50%
of
all
prisoners
who
accidentally
fall
into
this
range
of
customary
lengths
of
imprisonment.
now,
congress
in
passing
the
1976
act
did
not
tell
the
parole
board
that
it
should
be
in
sentencing
business.
congress,
the
1976
act
was
the
result
of
a
compromise
between
the
house
bill
which
would've
created
the
presumption
of
parole
after
prisoner
has
served
the
third
of
his
sentence
and
the
senate
bill
which
would've
reenacted
the
old
parole
release
criteria
and
which
would
have
--
or
which
would
have
sought
to
ratify
the
guidelines
then
existing.
the
compromise
which
came
out
of
the
conference
committee
was
to
in
effect
reenact
the
same
--
the
preexisting
criteria
but
to
require
that
decisions
be
made
pursuant
to
guidelines.
now
from
this,
the
commission
says
that,
"well,
congress
is
authorizing
us
to
do
what
we've
been
doing
before,
which
was
to
use
those
kinds
of
guidelines."
that's
not
at
all
clear
and
that's
exactly
contrary
to
what's
in
the
conference
report
which
talks
about
how
in
promulgating
its
guidelines,
the
commission
shall
be
cognizant
to
past
criticisms
of
its
decision-making.
some
of
those
criticisms
which
are
in
the
house
hearings
was
that
the
guidelines
which
the
board
is
using
are
wrong.
you
serve
the
sentencing
function
and
are
just
improper.
the
board
should
not
be
in
the
sentencing
business.
the
--
something
else,
the
1976
act
did
was
to
make
permanent
some
changes
that
the
board
have
adopted
in
administrative
reorganization
in
1973.
the
commission
seeks
to
argue
that
by
making
those
improvements
permanent,
what
congress
is
doing,
was
saying,
the
guidelines
should
be
permanent.
but
if
we
go
back
and
look
at
the
senate
hearings,
we
see
that
the
controversy
about
those
improvements
was
about
the
delegation
of
authority
to
hearing
examiners,
that
there
were
some
questions
that
whether
that
could
lawfully
be
done
with
that
new
legislation
and
that's
what
congress
was
looking
at.
there's
absolutely
no
indication
that
congress
intended
that
parole
release
decision
to
be
a
resentencing
decision.
that
congress
intended
parole
to
be
made
without
consideration
of
what
the
prisoner
did
in
prison,
which
is
what
the
court
would
have
to
read
the
statute
is
being,
in
order
to
hold
that
these
guidelines
are
consistent
with
the
1976
act.
this
--
the
act
rather
than
saying
that
all
these
factors
could
not
be
considered,
the
act
reaffirmed
the
view
that
parole
is
dependent
upon
what
people
do
in
prison
and
that's
--
we
allege
and
expect
to
prove
in
the
district
court
is
not
a
factor
in
these
guidelines
or
what
these
guidelines
are
as
a
resentencing
tool.
one
question
which
i
think
has
been
answered
without
dispute
in
the
district
court
is
where
do
these
guidelines
come
from?
how
did
the
parole
commission
get
in
the
business
of
making
parole
release
decisions
without
considering
the
actual
length
of
sentence?
and
we've
documented
that
fairly
well
without
any
dispute,
that
what
happened
was
that
the
parole
commission
did
a
study
of
how
decisions
were
made
in
youth
correctional
cases,
where
there
was
no
sentence.
and
this
study
show
that
two
factors
or
three
factors
were
used
in
parole
release
decisions
and
the
people
who
did
the
study
decided
or
mistakenly
believed
that
all
release
decisions
were
made
the
same
way
as
youth
correctional
cases
and
created
guidelines
for
the
board
which
applied
those
two
or
three
factors.
the
fact
is
that
75%
of
all
adult
prisoners
have
to
serve
a
third
of
their
sentence
before
they
become
eligible
for
parole
and
it's
under
--
it's
wrong
to
say
that
the
parole
commission
was
making
--
was
--
was
using
the
same
policy
in
youth
act
cases
that
it
was
using
in
adult
cases.
but
that
--
that's
why
the
length
of
sentence
is
no
longer
a
factor
in
the
parole
release
decisions,
because
the
parole
board
entrusted
to
its
researchers
the
task
of
developing
guidelines
which
probably
weren't
understood
by
the
board
which
were
caved
to
it
as
having
been
scientifically
developed
and
which
should've
been
used
to
interfere
with
the
interest
that
the
members
of
this
potential
class
having
parole
release.
the
--
some
of
the
other
claims
which
were
presented
in
the
complaint,
which
were
not
brought
up
i
believe,
in
the
narrow
question
posed
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
include
--
if
these
guidelines
are
consistent
with
the
statute,
could
congress
have
lawfully
delegated
this
power
to
the
parole
commission?
could
congress
without
any
standards
at
all
say,
you
are
to
set
--
you,
the
parole
commissioner,
set
new
standards
for
how
long
people
should
do
in
prison.
could
congress
delegate
this
judicial
function
of
resentencing
to
an
administrative
agency?
and
then
there's
another
question
which
is
based
on
our
allegation
that
under
the
new
policies,
under
the
guidelines,
people
serve
more
time
in
prison
than
they
serve
formally.
that
with
the
heightened
emphasis
on
offense
severity,
someone
who
would've
been
released
after
he
or
she
had
served
the
third
of
their
sentence,
is
now
required
to
serve
their
entire
sentence
in
prison.
if
this
is
true,
and
we
expect
the
evidence
to
show
that,
then
there's
an
ex
post
facto
question,
which
the
government
seems
to
disagree
with
but
based
merely
upon
the
facts
rather
than
upon
the
applicability
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
parole
release
petition.
those
questions
i
think
weren't
brought
up
in
the
narrow
--
in
question
3
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
even
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
parole
commission
on
the
issue
it
brought
up,
there
should
still
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
and
if
the
district
court
concludes
that
geraghty
cannot
adequately
represent
the
class
because
he's
no
longer
in
prison,
as
we
told
the
district
court
in
august
of
1978,
that's
not
relevant.
there
are
other
people
who
have
communicated
with
the
attorneys
of
mr.
geraghty
who
said,
"we
want
to
be
in
your
case.
we
want
to
be
named
plaintiffs
because
we
think
the
system
is
wrong
and
it
should
be
changed."
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
the
--
if
--
i
think,
the
traditional
ways
parties
perceive
an
injury
and
then
seek
legal
assistance
and
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here.
people
--
that
the
question
that
your
honor
raised
in
roper,
how
many
of
these
90,000
people
in
roper
knows
about
the
case,
if
that
question
was
asked
here,
i
think
that
probably,
every
prisoner
who
can
read
or
who
can
converse
with
other
prisoner
knows
about
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh,
i
mean
expressing,
that
that's
correct.
i
think
that
was
the
same
kind
of
information
requested
from
the
attorney
in
roper.
that
--
and
these
people
have
come
forward
to
intervene
and
i
represent
five
people
who
feel
they've
aggrieved
to
want
to
get
redress.
thank
you.
