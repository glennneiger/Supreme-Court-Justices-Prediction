the
tax
statute
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
of
course
the
disclosure
of
information
is
required
in
order
to
decide
the
tax
liability
and
the
tax
consequences.
do
you
know
of
any
cases
like
this
in
which
the
disclosure
requirement
is
simply
for
the
purpose
of
existing
enforcement
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
was
the
claim
made
--
i
suppose
the
respondent
here
made
the
self-incrimination
claim
very
early
in
the
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
when
what?
when
he
was
asked
--
when
he
was
assigned
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
tax
laws
if
someone
wants
--
isn't
it
the
rule
that
if
you
want
to
claim
your
fifth
amendment
privilege
you
should
claim
it
in
connection
with
the
matter
that
you
don't
want
to
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
automatically
are
--
you
cannot
be
convicted
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
correct
however
that
even
if
the
oil
spill
were
entirely
cleaned
up
by
the
person
who
reported
it
be
nevertheless
might
have
a
penalty
assessed
against
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
the
legal
issue
is
concerned,
i
understand
the
amount
of
the
penalty
can
now
be
larger
than
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
matter
of
statutorial
or
constitutional
power
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
agency
thought
it
were
extremely
serious
and
they
wanted
to
deter
future
carelessness,
even
though
there
were
no
harm
in
the
particular
case,
they
could
assess
a
penalty
of
$150,000
and
we
would
have
exactly
the
same
legal
issue,
wouldn't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
punitive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
congress
to
pass
a
law
requiring
motorists
to
report
every
time
they
exceeded
the
55-mile
limit
and
to
pay
a
civil
penalty
of
$5
a
mile
for
the
excess
and
say
that
the
report
could
not
be
used
in
any
criminal
case
against
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
there
is
as
great
an
interest
in
preventing
death
on
the
highway,
i
suppose,
as
there
is
in
preventing
oil
spills.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
should
think
your
rationale
would
justify
such
a
statute.
