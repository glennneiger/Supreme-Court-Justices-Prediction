chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
united
states
v.
ward
and
others.
mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
cite
california
v.
byers?
i
don't
find
it
in
their
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
also
said
that
that
is
primarily
related
to
that
that
statute
in
california
v.
byers
is
related
to
the
civil
aspects.
isn't
it
something
more
than
that,
isn't
it
related
to
the
state's
overall
responsibility
for
safety
on
the
highway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
in
byers
is
that
the
citizens
of
california
rare
compelled
to
leave
their
name
and
address
if
they
had
an
automobile
accident,
and
then
that
could
be
used
against
them
in
either
civil
or
criminal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
now
whether
the
california
v.
byers
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
tenth
circuit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
assume
that
the
united
states
attorney
presenting
it
would
have
been
aware
of
that
case,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
cited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
filing
a
tax
return
it
is
not
unknown,
is
it,
that
certain
expenses
and
deductions
will
be
claimed,
have
been
claimed
but
the
detailed
explanation
is
reserved
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
of
course
might
arouse
the
interest
of
an
internal
revenue
agent
somewhat
but
that
is
the
way
to
go
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
again,
what
happens
if
you
don't
file
the
report
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
suppose
the
statute
provided
that
anyone
going
over
55
miles
an
hour
had
to
make
a
report
saying
exactly
what
his
speed
was
and
his
average
point
to
point
and
$50
or
$5
for
each
mile
over
55;
but
that
failure
to
file
a
report
at
all
would
be
a
$500
fine
--
not
criminal,
$500
civil
penalty.
do
you
think
that
would
pass
muster
under
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
the
civil
penalty
reach
dimensions
that
would
raise
fifth
amendment
issues.
suppose
it
was
$5,000
fine
for
not
filing
your
report
on
speeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
it
provided
that
forfeiture
of
the
truck
would
follow;
forfeiture
of
the
vehicle,
total
forfeiture
would
be
the
civil
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
registration
error.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
