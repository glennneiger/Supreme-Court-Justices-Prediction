mr.
stephen
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
respond
to
certain
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
kneedler
and
perhaps
give
an
answer
slightly
in
variance
with
that
given
by
him.
with
respect
to
the
facts
i
believe
that
the
government
left
out
two
important
considerations
that
the
court
should
bear
in
mind.
number
one,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
court
below
that
ward
or
any
of
his
employees
were
responsible
for
the
spill
that
occurred
in
this
case.
the
act
of
congress
makes
the
penalty
imposed
on
the
basis
of
strict
liability.
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
example,
asked
the
question
might
the
penalty
be
imposed.
there
is
no
"might"
about
it.
the
penalty
is
automatically
imposed
in
every
situation
regardless
of
fault,
regardless
of
clean-up,
when
there
is
an
oil
spill.
and
the
penalty
is
imposed
against
the
owner
or
the
operator,
not
against
the
person
responsible
for
the
spill.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes.
as
applied
in
this
case
it
is.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir,
under
the
statutory
scheme.
let
me
explain
why.
your
honor
raised
the
question
of
helvering
v.
mitchell.
there
is
a
critical
difference.
the
information
supplied
in
helvering
v.
mitchell,
which
was
not
a
self-incrimination
case
in
any
event,
was
essentially
neutral.
and
that
case
turned
on
another
question.
but
the
supreme
court
earlier
had
decided
in
sullivan
v.
united
states
that
the
filing
of
an
income
tax
return
did
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
clause
dealing
with
self-incrimination,
because
the
information
was
essentially
neutral.
but
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
opinion
pointed
out
that
if
the
information
called
for
by
filing
the
return
would
incriminate
the
taxpayer
he
need
not
provide
that
information.
mr.
stephen
jones
sir,
as
i
read
helvering
and
sullivan
and
the
other
income
tax
cases
and
also
byers
which
i
wanted
to
speak
to,
the
information
is
essentially
neutral.
there
is
in
reality
no
penalty
or
sanction
imposed
upon
someone
that
files
an
honest
income
tax
return.
all
he
has
to
do
is
pay
the
tax.
here,
though,
if
you
are
not
responsible
for
the
oil
spill
you
still
have
to
pay
the
penalty,
even
if
you
take
every
effort
to
avoid
an
oil
spill
as
general
motors
did
in
united
states
v.
general
motors.
the
coast
guard
still
assessed
them
a
fine
of
$1,200
which
the
district
court
cut
to
$1.
the
court
inquired
of
counsel
concerning
byers
v.
california
and
there
are
some
critical
differences
in
that
case
and
this
one.
as
i
read
the
court's
decision
in
byers
there
are
at
least.
this
court
in
finding
that
the
california
hit
and
run
statute,
so-called
hit
and
run
statute
did
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
it
found
first
of
all
that
the
mere
possibility
of
incrimination
was
insufficient
and
found
also
that
driving
a
vehicle
is
a
lawful
activity
and
found
that
even
if
incriminating
the
report
is
not
necessarily
testimonial.
now,
let
us
contrast
that
with
here.
here,
having
an
oil
spill
is
an
offense
and
that
is
the
word
used
by
congress.
it
is
an
offense
for
which
a
civil
penalty
is
imposed.
number
two,
the
report
is
clearly
incriminating
because
it
is
on
the
basis
of
the
report
that
the
fine
is
assessed.
and
number
three,
the
report
clearly
is
testimonial.
now,
this
court
in
california
--
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
which
i
was
going
to
address
but
if
i
could
just
say
the
court
in
california
v.
byers
pointed
out
that
there
are
many
accidents
where
there
is
no
liability
attached
and
certainly
no
criminal
liability.
now,
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
a
proceeding
to
collect
this
penalty,
even
though
denominated
civil,
is
in
reality
a
criminal
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
counsel
for
the
government
contracted
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
but
there
is
a
critical
difference.
the
sixth
amendment
speaks
of
criminal
prosecutions.
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
of
criminal
cases.
and
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
has
never
been
applied
in
an
action
to
collect
a
civil
penalty.
but
this
court
and
the
state
courts
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
going
back
to
the
english
system,
have
consistently
applied
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
in
actions
to
collect
civil
penalties.
and
that
was
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
boyd
v.
united
states
which
has
been
reaffirmed
either
implicitly
or
--
implicitly
in
lees
v.
united
states,
hepner
v.
united
states,
hogan
v.
united
states
and
in
footnote
3
of
helvering
v.
mitchell
and
u.s.
v.
u.s.
coin
and
currency
and
in
one
1958
plymouth
sedan
because
the
court
said
in
boyd
that
an
action
to
collect
a
civil
penalty
--
in
that
case
$1,000
--
and
the
statute
clearly
said
that
it
was
non-criminal,
this
court
nevertheless
found
that
the
penalty
was,
in
effect,
quasi-criminal.
and
it
required,
if
the
court
will
recall,
in
boyd
--
this
was
as
i
recall
a
statute
involving
an
alien
--
that
you
had
to
furnish
certain
reports
and
information
to
the
government;
and
if
you
did
not
furnish
them,
the
penalty
would
be
assessed.
and
the
court
said,
rightly
so,
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
even
though
it
was
denominated
non-criminal.
now,
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
has
taken
issue
with
our
history
and
i
would
just
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
very
briefly
that
each
of
the
authorities
cited
by
the
government,
beginning
with
dean
wigmore
at
section
2256
of
volume
8,
adopts
our
position
that
actions
to
collect
civil
penalties
can
violate
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
same
position
is
taken
in
greenleaf
on
evidence,
taylor
on
evidence
and
mr.
joseph
story's
commentary
on
equity
pleading.
what
the
government
says
is
that
this
rule
is
not
a
constitutional
rule,
it
is
a
rule
of
equity.
but
it
overlooks
the
fact,
as
discussed
in
some
length
in
leonard
levy's
classic
the
origin
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
in
fact
the
founding
fathers,
the
state
constitutional
conventions,
the
first
congress
when
it
passed
the
fifth
amendment
had
in
mind
these
civil
penalties
which
had
been
abused;
and
that
the
early
cases
make
it
clear
that
they
were
given
the
constitutional
protection
against
the
self-incrimination
clause.
and,
as
i
indicated,
that
has
been
the
position
of
this
court,
this
court
has
consistently
applied
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
actions
to
collect
fines,
penalties
and
forfeitures.
now,
in
this
case
even
if
this
court
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
if
there
had
never
been
boyd,
if
there
had
not
been
this
history
--
mr.
stephen
jones
no,
sir.
as
i
understand
the
cases,
they
explicitly
recognize
that
a
civil
collection
procedure
and
proceeding
was
at
issue.
but
they
--
mr.
stephen
jones
no,
sir.
mr.
stephen
jones
no,
sir.
what
this
court
has
said,
as
i
understand
the
decisions,
is
that
if
you
attempt
to
have
the
person
from
whom
you
are
extricating
the
fine,
if
you
compel
him
to
testify,
you
cannot
do
that
to
collect
a
penalty.
mr.
stephen
jones
that
was
specifically
the
issue
in
lees.
mr.
stephen
jones
well,
no,
sir.
in
lees
--
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
in
lees
v.
united
states
and
boyd
v.
united
states
the
court
paid
no
attention
and
did
not
discuss
at
all
that
mr.
boyd
and
mr.
lees'
answer
might
incriminate
them
in
some
other
proceeding.
it
was
that
they
had
to
pay
the
fine,
which
i
believe
was
$1,000
in
those
particular
cases.
but,
as
i
indicated,
even
if
the
court
did
not
have
that
history
before
it,
it
is
clear
that
this
particular
statutory
scheme
is
punitive
beyond
any
question.
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
referred
to
in
any
other
way
other
than
a
penalty.
and
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
u.s.
v.
lefranka,
u.s.
v.
tex-tow,
one
1956
plymouth
sedan
and
u.s.
v.
futura
that
penalties
are
imposed
for
punishment,
whether
they
are
criminal
penalties
or
civil
penalties.
number
two,
we
have
in
this
case
the
forced
reporting.
if
you
do
not
report
this
spill
you
can
go
to
jail.
if
you
do
report
this
spill
you
can
be
given
a
civil
penalty
of
up
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
in
this
particular
case
it
was
quite
small
$500
and
then
cut
to
$250.
but
the
statute
as
presently
written
authorizes
a
civil
penalty
of
up
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
number
three,
the
exact
same
conduct,
the
exact
same
conduct
in
this
case
is
also
a
crime.
the
refuse
act
does
not
require
scienter,
the
government
does
not
have
to
show
intent
to
violate
it;
it
is
a
strict
liability
statute
and
it
is
also
a
crime.
so
the
same
conduct
here
is
also
a
crime.
the
action
that
is
referred
to
here
is
called
an
offense,
congress
makes
it
an
offense
to
spill
oil
or
for
that
matter
be
an
owner
or
operator
where
oil
is
spilled,
again
showing
the
punitive
nature.
and
if
there
were
any
other
question
about
it
involved,
we
have
cited
on
page
60
of
our
brief
from
page
3
of
a
senate
report
that
the
whole
purpose
of
passing
this
bill,
or
the
original
bill,
the
1979
act,
was
to
punish
oil
spillers.
so
when
we
combine
in
a
statutory
network
such
phrases
as
penalty,
offense,
strict
liability,
and
punishment,
it
is
clear
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
punitive
and
not
a
remedial
statute
as
this
court
--
or
at
least
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
considered
in
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez.
mr.
stephen
jones
well,
your
honor,
you
can
go
to
jail
for
strict
liability
crimes
even
though
there
is
no
mons
re.
that
is
the
refuse
act.
mr.
stephen
jones
there
is
a
unique
feature
about
this.
the
government
at
attempts
to
have
it
both
ways
on
the
question
of
intent
or
scienter.
it
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
factor
but
yet
in
the
coast
guard
regulations
it
is
a
factor.
that
was
a
factor
troublesome
to
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
opinion
and
they
treated
that
at
some
length.
but
in
addition
to
the
factors
that
i
have
already
mentioned
that
i
think
clearly
show
it
is
punitive,
what
convinced
the
tenth
circuit
unanimously
that
this
was
a
proceeding
within
the
fifth
amendment
were
the
factors
that
the
coast
guard
used.
because
the
tenth
circuit
said,
"look,
if
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
assessing
this
penalty
are
for
non-punitive,
remedial
regulatory
purposes,
then
this
penalty
--
or
this
proceeding
may
not
be
a
criminal
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
"on
the
other
hand,
if
looking
at
these
factors
we
find
that
they
are
not
related
to
the
regulatory
goal
that
the
congress
has
put
forward
in
the
preamble
to
the
act,"
then
they
clearly
are
punitive."
and
the
court
went
down
and
looked
at
each
of
these
factors
and
pulled
out
from
the
coast
guard
regulations
themselves.
for
example,
the
coast
guard
considers
the
gravity
of
a
violation,
the
prior
history,
the
person
--
the
owner/operator.
it
considers
the
effect
of
the
fine
on
his
business.
it
considers
how
large
his
business
is.
but
at
the
time
it
expressly
would
not
under
any
circumstances
consider
the
clean-up
effort
of
the
operator
or
the
fact
that
all
of
the
oil
had
been
removed.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
when
you
look
at
that
it
is
clear
that
what
congress
intended
here
was
a
punitive
penalty
and
that
it
simply
was
attempting
to
have
the
hammer
to
beat
over
the
head
of
the
oil
spiller
in
an
attempt
to
clean
up
the
water.
now,
one
thing
that
i
think
the
court
might
wish
to
consider
is
that
the
tenth
circuit,
in
our
opinion
appropriately
so,
decision
does
not
adversely
affect
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
the
circuit
carved
out
a
use
immunity
provision
and
it
simply
said
this,
that
any
information
supplied
by
an
owner
or
operator
who
is
non-corporate
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
assessing
the
penalty.
mr.
stephen
jones
a
use
immunity
for
what
congress
called
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
jones
now,
the
way
we
feel
that
is
significant
here
is
that
it
meets
the
argument
of
the
government
that
if
this
court
would
uphold
the
tenth
circuit
it
would
severely
retard
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
it
would
not
retard
the
enforcement
of
this
act
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
does
not
apply
to
any
corporation,
as
is
obvious
because
corporations
have
no
fifth
amendment
protection
against
self-incrimination.
number
two,
--
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir,
it
would
be
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
jones
no,
sir.
this
court
has
--
mr.
stephen
jones
mr.
justice
white,
this
court
has
never
held
that
actions
to
collect
civil
penalties,
even
if
they
are
quasi-criminal,
involve
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
in
fact
the
federal
courts
have
specifically
ruled
otherwise.
mr.
stephen
jones
if
we
examine
the
cases
closely
what
emerges
to
us,
that
the
teaching
of
the
case
is
just
this
-
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
a
very
high
priority
in
our
scheme
of
ordered
liberty
and
that
we
are
going
--
i
mean
the
courts
are
going
to
protect
that
and
give
it
a
greater
breadth
than
we
would
otherwise
enumerate
in
first
ten
amendments.
and
in
fact
that
is
exactly
what
justice
brandeis
said
in
footnote
3
to
helvering
v.
mitchell.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
jones
yes,
sir.
in
this
particular
case,
incidentally,
there
was
a
jury
trial
simply
because
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
water
ever
reached
boggie
creek,
which
is
not
material
to
the
issue
here.
but
that
would
be
a
rare
instance.
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
a
moment
as
to
why
the
act
would
not
be
retarded,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
does
not
cover
and
by
"it"
i
mean
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
does
not
cover
corporations.
if
we
look
at
the
petition
for
the
certiorari
filed
in
this
case
by
--
mr.
stephen
jones
reason
number
one,
they
gave
come
interesting
statistics
concerning
oil
spills.
it
is
obvious
from
reading
those
statistics
prepared
by
the
coast
guard
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
oil
spills
occur
on
facilities
operated
by
corporate
owners
and
therefore
this
act
would
not
apply
to
this.
as
i
calculate
it
that
would
be
approximately
90
percent
of
the
spills.
thirdly,
this
would
not
apply
if
there
was
not
an
immediate
notification.
so
if
the
court
upheld
the
position
of
the
tenth
circuit
the
act
would
not
be
retarded
in
its
enforcement.
we
have
in
our
brief
at
some
length
discussed
the
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez
case.
quite
frankly
we
believe
that
the
factors
used
there
are
ambiguous
and
that
factors
1,
2
and
3
go
either
way.
we
say
however
that
factors
4,
5,
6
and
7
point
toward
this
being
a
punitive
statute
and
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
opinion.
in
the
final
analysis
we
bottom
our
position
upon
this
court's
ruling
in
boyd
and
that
a
reading
of
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez
and
the
statutory
history
and
the
statutory
construction
clearly
show
that
this
is
a
punitive
statute.
now,
the
argument
may
be
made
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
case
in
the
sense
that
mr.
ward
was
not
arrested,
he
wasn't
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
therefore,
as
the
government
says,
it
is
clear
by
stipulation
--
not
by
stipulation,
but
it
is
clear
from
reading
the
statute
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
doesn't
apply
here.
but
this
court
has
said
in
ullman
v.
united
states
that
the
clause
--
meaning
the
self-incrimination
clause
is
not
to
be
interpreted
literally.
that
is
found
at
page
438.
in
counselman
v.
hitchcock
at
page
562
this
court
said
it
is
impossible
that
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
provisions
involving
self-incrimination
can
only
be
that
a
person
shall
not
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
criminal
prosecutions
against
himself.
the
reason
for
that
of
course
is
that
until
the
post-civil
war
period
in
federal
criminal
cases
a
defendant
could
not
even
be
a
witness
in
a
criminal
case,
either
for
himself
or
for
the
government.
and
of
course
that
was
the
rule
in
most
state
prosecutions
at
the
time
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted.
if
we
go
down
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
this
court,
this
court
has
defined
the
words
"criminal
case"
which
after
all
are
the
most
important
words
in
this
case,
to
have
a
broader
meaning
than
simply
in
a
situation
where
an
individual
has
been
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
forced
to
stand
trial.
and
of
course
the
leading
came
in
that
respect
is
boyd
v.
united
states,
although
there
are
others.
in
the
final
analysis,
boyd
says
that
the
mischief
against
which
the
fifth
amendment
is
there
to
protect
appears
in
its
most
attractive
form
to
begin
with.
and
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
there
is
a
natural
concern
by
everyone
to
keep
the
waters
clean.
that
is
our
concern
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
mr.
ward
promptly
moved
to
clean
it
up.
the
government
says,
"but
this
will
inhibit
other
civil
penalties."
it
will
not
inhibit
any
other
civil
penalty
because
there
is
no
other
civil
penalty
currently
on
the
books
similar
to
this
one.
but
if
this
court
lets
down
the
guard
and
allows
this
type
of
compulsory
reporting
to
come
forward,
then
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
emasculated
and
that
it
will
be
a
stunted
right
against
self-incrimination.
