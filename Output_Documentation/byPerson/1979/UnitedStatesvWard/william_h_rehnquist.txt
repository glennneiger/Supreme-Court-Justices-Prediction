justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
any
effort
to
distinguish
helvering
v.
mitchell,
the
justice
brandeis
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
just
looking
through
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
it
did
not
really
mention
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
also
dealing
with
the
self-reporting
requirement
of
income
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
read
you
this
language
from
helvering
v.
mitchell
on
page
309
of
303
u.s.
"in
assessing
income
taxes
the
government
relies
primarily
upon
the
disclosure
by
the
taxpayer
of
the
relevant
facts.
this
disclosure
requires
him
to
make
in
his
annual
return
to
insure
full
and
honest
disclosure
to
discourage
fraudulent
attempts
to
evade
the
act
congress
imposes
sanctions.
such
sanctions
may
confessedly
be
either
criminal
or
civil."
doesn't
that
strike
you
as
somewhat
resembling
the
scheme
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
failure
to
file
an
income
tax
return?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
stricter
standard
than
the
law
that
requires
one
to
file
in
income
tax
return?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
generally
speaking.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
helvering,
justice
brandois
says
to
insure
full
and
honest
disclosure
to
discourage
fraudulent
attempts
to
evade
the
tax
congress
imposes
sanctions.
now,
that
certainly
doesn't
suggest
that
the
information
is
necessarily
neutral.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wouldn't
think,
counsel,
that
strict
liability
really
helped
you,
because
it
cuts
out
all
notion
of
mons
re
i
think
traditionally
associated
with
culpable
intent
that
are
also
associated
with
crime.
i
would
think
strict
liability
would
cut
in
favor
of
the
civil
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
whether
this
is
a
crime
or
a
civil
assessed
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
had
already
carved
out
a
quite
different
use
immunity
provision,
hadn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
