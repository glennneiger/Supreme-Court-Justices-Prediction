mr.
jones,
the

you
are
referring
to,
do
you
treat
the
collection
process
as
a
criminal
or

or
did
it
just
say
that
you
could
claim
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
it
wasn't
an
immunity
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
are
cases
saying
that
there
can
be
no
civil
fines?

justice
byron

i
know,
but
how

what
is
the
theory
of
saying
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
for
the
sixth?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
government
sues
to
collect
a
civil
fine
you
can
have
summary
