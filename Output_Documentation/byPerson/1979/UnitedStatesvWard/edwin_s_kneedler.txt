mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
proceeding
to
recover
a
civil
penalty
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
for
an
oil
spill
is
a
criminal
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
issue
arises
because
of
the
interplay
in
this
case
between
the
reporting
and
penalty
provisions
of
section
311
of
the
act,
which
i
shall
briefly
described.
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
which
is
now
commonly
known
as
the
clean
water
act
establishes
a
comprehensive
program
for
restoring
and
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
nation's
waters.
section
311
is
specifically
directed
to
the
problem
of
oil
spills
and
discharges
of
hazardous
substances.
this
provision
was
first
enacted
in
roughly
its
present
form
in
1970,
principally
in
response
to
the
widely
publicized
oil
spill
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
and
the
break-up
of
the
tanker
torrey
canyon
which
caused
extensive
damage
to
the
coast
of
england
and
cost
better
than
$8
million
to
clean
up.
section
311(b)(3)
states
the
basic
prohibition
which
is
against
the
discharge
of
harmful
quantities
of
oil
and
hazardous
substances
into
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
adjoining
shorelines
or
into
the
seas
contiguous
to
the
united
states.
the
act
provides
for
a
national
contingency
plan
to
deal
with
oil
spills
and
hazardous
substance
discharges
when
they
occur
and
it
also
authorizes
the
president
to
provide
for
the
clean
up
of
those
discharges
unless
the
president
is
satisfied
that
the
owner/operator
of
the
vessel
or
facility
where
the
discharge
occurs
will
adequately
clean
it
up.
in
order
that
the
federal
government
can
insure
that
these
clean
up
and
mitigation
measures
are
taken
promptly
and
thereby
limit
the
ensuing
damage,
section
311(b)(5),
one
of
the
sections
in
which
the
issue
in
this
case
centers,
requires
the
person
in
charge
of
the
vessel
or
facility
to
notify
the
appropriate
agency
of
the
federal
government
immediately
when
a
prohibitive
discharge
occurs.
the
failure
to
do
so
is
a
criminal
offense.
congress
was
sensitive
to
the
fifth
amendment
concerns
of
this
reporting
requirement,
however,
and
expressly
provided
in
it
that
the
notification
to
the
appropriate
agency
of
the
government
and
information
derived
from
exploitation
of
that
notice
may
not
be
used
in
any
criminal
case
except
in
a
prosecution
for
perjury
or
for
submitting
a
false
statement.
while
the
government
does
clean
up
the
discharge
rather
than
leaving
it
to
the
individual
owner/operator
to
do
the
government
can
in
return
recover
the
cost
of
the
clean-up
from
the
responsible
owner/operator,
except
that
the
owner/operator
has
statutory
defense
as
to
liability
in
certain
cases
such
as
where
the
discharge
was
caused
by
god
or
an
act
of
war,
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
united
states
or
the
third
party.
moneys
recovered
from
the
owners/operators
for
the
government's
clean-up
costs
are
then
in
turn
paid
into
a
special
statutory
revolving
fund
established
under
the
act
and
this
revolving
fund
is
then
used
to
clean
up
other
oil
spills
and
is
in
turn
replenished
when
the
owners
and
operators
pay
back
in.
the
owner/operator
may
also
be
liable
under
state
or
other
provisions
of
federal
law
for
damages
to
private
property
resulting
from
an
oil
spill,
and
aside
from
the
question
of
clean
up.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not
know
the
present
balance.
i
do
know
that
when
the
act
was
initially
passed
appropriated
funds
were
placed
into
it
and
the
authorization
at
the
original
time
was
$35
million.
i
would
also
point
out
that
based
on
the
1973
statistics
that
we
put
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
it
appeared
that
there
were
14,000
oil
spills
that
the
government
was
aware
of
under
this
act
and
something
like
8,000
of
those
cases
the
government
was
able
to
trace
the
spill
to
a
particular
source.
so
while
the
penalty
in
a
particular
case,
in
this
case
for
example
$250,
might
be
small
in
an
individual
case
those
penalties
would
accumulate
and
make
up
a
substantial
portion
of
the
funds
in
this
statutory
fund.
in
addition
to
the
liability
to
the
united
states
for
clean-up
and
possible
liability
to
third
parties
for
damages
to
property
section
311(b)(6),
the
other
provision
that
is
specifically
involved
here,
provides
that
the
owner
or
operator
or
the
person
in
charge
of
the
facility
--
anyone
of
these
--
shall
be
assessed
a
civil
penalty
in
an
amount
not
exceeding
$5,000
whenever
a
prohibited
discharge
occurs.
the
coast
guard
has
construed
this
statute
to
require
that
at
least
some
penalty
be
assessed
in
every
case
but
the
statute
itself
requires
that
the
amount
of
the
penalty
within
that
$5,000
range
be
tailored
according
to
the
gravity
of
the
particular
violation,
the
size
of
the
business
concerned
and
the
effect
of
the
penalty
on
the
ability
of
the
owner/operator
to
remain
in
business.
the
civil
penalty
case
now
before
the
court
resulted
from
an
oil
spill
at
respondent's
property
near
enid,
oklahoma
on
march
23,
1975.
at
that
time
about
20
barrels
of
combination
oil
and
mud
apparently
escaped
from
the
retention
pit
at
the
drilling
facility.
on
march
25
the
sanitarian
with
the
state
health
department
was
conducting
a
routine
inspection
for
other
purposes
nearby
and
noticed
that
oil
had
seeped
out
of
the
retention
pit,
had
run
down
a
gully
and
into
a
stream
by
the
name
of
boggie
creek.
respondent
does
not
contest
in
this
court
that
boggie
creek
is
a
navigable
water
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
or
that
the
amount
of
oil
discharged
in
this
case
is
harmful
for
purposes
of
the
act.
on
the
same
day
that
the
state
sanitarian
observed
the
spill
the
state
health
department
notified
respondent
of
the
spill,
respondent
notified
epa
of
the
spill
eight
days
later
as
he
was
required
to
do
order
section
311(b)(5).
on
june
25
respondent
submitted
a
more
complete
report
pursuant
to
an
epa
request
under
another
provision
of
the
clean
water
act
administered
by
epa.
epa
then
forwarded
these
reports
to
the
coast
guard
which
relied
upon
them
in
assessing
a
civil
penalty
against
respondent
in
the
amount
of
$500.
respondent
filed
an
administrative
appeal
from
this
assessment,
contending
that
the
use
of
the
required
reports
to
assess
the
civil
penalty
constituted
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
but
this
appeal
was
denied.
respondent
then
filed
an
action
in
district
court
seeking
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
these
provisions
and
enjoin
collection
of
the
civil
penalty.
the
government
soon
thereafter
filed
a
collection
action
to
recover
the
unpaid
civil
penalty.
the
district
court
consolidated
these
two
cases
and
denied
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
again
raising
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
the
court
then
determined
that
respondent
--
that
the
oil
spill
at
respondent's
property
had
violated
the
act
but
reduced
the
civil
penalty
that
had
been
assessed
in
the
amount
of
$500
by
the
coast
guard
to
$250,
for
two
reasons.
one,
what
the
court
believed
to
be
the
relatively
insubstantial
amount
of
oil
that
had
been
spilled,
although
it
was
still
a
violation
of
the
act.
and,
secondly,
taking
into
account
what
the
court
believed
was
respondent's
diligence
in
cleaning
up
the
discharge.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
award
of
the
civil
penalty
to
the
united
states.
despite
congress'
expressed
designation
of
the
penalty
as
civil
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
certain
punitive
aspects
to
it
and
therefore
determined
that
it
was
criminal.
the
court
did
not
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
civil
penalty
provision
or
the
required
notice
provision
of
the
act
but
simply
applied
immunity
providing
that
the
required
notice
and
information
derived
from
that
notice
could
not
be
used
in
assessing
either
the
liability
for
or
the
amount
of
the
civil
penalty.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
it
did
not
--
i
do
not
recall
if
it
was
mentioned.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
frankly
do
not
recall
if
it
was
specifically
mentioned.
it
did
mention
several
of
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
course
in
helvering
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
civil
penalty
of
50
percent
for
fraud
against
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
well,
no,
i
am
sorry,
the
helvering
--
right
--
i
suppose
that
could
have
been
indirectly
implicated.
but
in
helvering
the
question
was
whether
that
was
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
because
the
defendant
in
helvering
had
been
acquitted
of
criminal
fraud
against
the
united
states
and
then
the
question
came
whether
the
government
was
barred
by
double
jeopardy
from
--
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
from
recovering
the
penalty.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
in
that
sense
it
does.
i
guess
i
was
focusing
on
the
particular
constitutional
right
that
was
involved
there.
but
to
that
extent
it
certainly
does,
that
the
liability
was
based
on
the
information
in
the
tax
return
that
was
fraudulent.
and
in
fact
i
think
one
of
the
implications
of
the
court's
decision
here,
although
it
does
not
precisely
explain
what
the
scope
of
the
decision
was,
is
that
it
could
have
a
disturbing
impact
on
the
wide
number
of
both
federal
and
state
statutes
that
are
now
moving
more
and
more
toward
the
use
of
civil
penalties
as
an
integral
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
and
of
course
the
provision
for
assessment
of
civil
penalties
under
the
tax
statutes
is
one
of
the
longstanding
examples
of
that.
and
it
is
being
used
more
frequently
in
regulatory
statutes,
for
instance
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
with
safety
provisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
specifically.
the
case
of
california
v.
byers
comes
to
mind
as
being
somewhat
on
point.
in
that
case
the
purpose
of
the
reporting
requirement
was
to
identity
persons
involved
in
automobile
accidents
and
that
was
seen
primarily
in
aid
of
adjusting
private
liability.
it
was
not
for
instance
a
reporting
requirement
that
was
intended
solely
in
order
to
bring
an
action
against
someone.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
to
my
recollection.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
to
be
sure.
many
states,
for
example,
might
count
an
accident,
for
example
a
certain
number
of
points,
to
deprive
someone
of
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
there
were
really
two
separate
discussions
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
byers,
one
that
it
had
to
a
certain
extent
this
purpose
of
identifying
persons
involved
in
accidents
for
purposes
of
private
liability.
and
then,
secondly,
the
court
described
the
fact
that
the
information
was
not
in
some
respect
--
it
was
not
testimonial
in
nature.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
cited.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
as
i
mentioned,
the
government
is
somewhat
concerned
about
the
potential
implications
of
the
decision,
not
just
with
respect
to
the
self-incrimination
clause
but
if
it
were
to
be
given
a
broader
reading
as
it
may
affect
the
application
of
other
rights
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
that
normally
attach
in
criminal
proceedings.
and
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
which
disregards
the
congress'
clear
designation
of
this
particular
penalty
as
civil
and
substitutes
instead
a
judicially-fashioned
standard
of
when
a
penalty
is
sufficiently
punitive,
that
the
court
believes
it
should
be
regarded
as
criminal.
we
think
it
would
embark
the
courts
on
a
difficult
course
of
line
drawing
in
trying
to
distinguish
which
particular
statutes
might
carry
attributes
that
in
the
abstract
might
seem
punitive
even
though
the
statute
was
designated
by
congress
as
being
civil.
and
specifically
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
the
language
of
the
privileges
provides
that
no
person
should
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
and
the
debates
on
the
proposal
in
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
house
in
1789
indicate
that
the
limitation
to
criminal
cases
was
deliberately
inserted
in
the
bill
of
rights
at
that
time.
the
term
"criminal"
of
course
appears
in
the
sixth
amendment
as
well
in
identifying
those
prosecutions
in
which
sixth
amendment
rights
attach
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
first
congress
intends
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
and
the
recommendations
of
the
four
state
ratifying
conventions
that
proposed
the
conclusion
of
a
privilege
similar
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
bill
of
rights
also
were
limited
in
their
concerns
to
the
criminal
context.
and
while
this
court
has
over
the
years
repeatedly
held
that
the
privilege
may
be
asserted
in
proceedings
that
are
civil
it
has
done
so
in
the
context
where
the
testimony
or
evidence
given
in
the
civil
or
other
proceeding
would
expose
the
person
to
criminal
liability.
the
court
has
not
departed
from
the
text
of
the
amendment
referring
to
a
criminal
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
he
made
the
claim
before
the
coast
guard.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
the
procedure
is
that
the
coast
guard
assesses
--
looks
at
all
the
factors
and
assesses
what
it
believes
to
be
the
appropriate
standard,
the
administrative
appeal
from
that,
at
that
point
respondent
did
argue
that
the
required
reports
could
not
be
used
for
purposes
of
assessing
the
civil
penalty.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
this
particular
case
the
provision
requiring
a
report
under
section
311(b)(5)
contains
an
expressed
immunity
clause
similar
in
language
to
other
immunity
provisions
although
in
this
case
it
is
self-executing,
there
is
no
requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
says
it
shall
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
case.
and
then
the
question
becomes
what
is
a
criminal
case.
and
of
course
the
language
"criminal
case"
is
directly
parallel
to
the
language
in
the
fifth
amendment.
so
the
assumption
would
be
that
congress
intended
then
to
have
the
similar
scope.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
well,
in
this
case
there
is
a
report
form
in
the
appendix
indicating
the
information
given
by
respondent
in
the
course
of
a
telephone
conversation
with
a
person
at
epa.
and
in
this
case
he
did
indicate
that
the
u.s.
spill
had
occurred
on
his
premises.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
question
of
whether
a
given
sanction
of
his
criminal
or
civil
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
in
the
present
case
congress
could
not
have
been
clear
in
manifesting
its
intent
that
the
sanction
be
civil.
it
is
designated
as
civil
and
the
procedure
for
its
collection
is
civil,
a
factor
which
the
court
found
persuasive
in
helvering
v.
mitchell.
we
must
therefore
assume
that
congress
used
the
term
"civil"
advisedly
and
that
it
affirmatively
decided
the
attainment
of
a
monetary
penalty
under
the
clean
water
act
should
not
carry
with
it
the
usual
stigma
that
attaches
to
someone
who
is
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense.
indeed
the
administrative
conference
and
the
drafters
of
the
model
penal
code
and
others
have
suggested
that
civil
penalties
be
utilized
instead
of
criminal
provisions
in
regulatory
statutes
such
as
this
for
exactly
that
reason,
to
avoid
the
problem
of
exposing
persons
unnecessarily
to
the
the
use
of
the
criminal
process
and
to
avoid
stigmatizing
persons
who
are
exposed
to
the
criminal
process
to
the
fact
of
criminal
conviction
when
society
at
large
would
not
usually
regard
the
conduct
of
being
worthy
or
deserving
of
that
kind
of
punishment.
we
do
not
believe
in
the
present
case,
for
example,
that
the
oil
spill
on
respondent's
property
would
ordinarily
be
of
the
type
that
would
warrant
bringing
a
criminal
prosecution
under
some
other
statute
such
as
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
and
we
do
not
understand
that
respondent
would
suggest
otherwise.
the
civil
penalty
provision
in
section
311(b)(5)
can
be
contrasted
we
think
instructively
in
this
regard
with
the
--
excuse
me,
section
311(b)(6)
can
be
contrasted
with
the
criminal
sanctions
in
section
311(b)(5)
for
failing
to
report
an
oil
spill
to
the
government,
even
where
the
owner/operator
is
wholly
innocent
with
respect
to
the
spill
in
the
sense
of
not
having
been
negligent
or
wilfull.
congress
evidently
believed
that
even
where
the
person
in
charge
of
the
vessel
or
facility
had
not
been
negligent
in
causing
the
spill
that
the
public
interest
in
requiring
prompt
notification
was
sufficiently
strong
in
order
to
prevent
damages
to
third
parties
and
prevent
damage
to
the
environment
that
the
failure
to
report
should
carry
criminal
consequences.
the
civil
nature
of
this,
the
penalty
involved
here
is
further
underscored
by
the
fact
mentioned
earlier
that
the
civil
penalties
are
paid
along
with
the
recoveries
from
persons
responsible
for
spills
into
this
statutory
revolving
fund,
it
has
the
effect
of
paying
the
government's
clean-up
costs
for
those
particular
spills
in
which
the
cost
cannot
be
recovered
from
the
owner/operator
who
is
responsible
for
the
particular
spill.
the
penalty
can
also
be
viewed
as
compensation
to
the
government
acting
parens
patriae
for
the
people
of
the
nation
for
what
congress
"presumably
believed
was
the
damage
to
the
environment
in
the
waters
that
would
occur
even
when
an
oil
spill
was
cleaned
up
relatively
promptly.
it
would
be
a
transitory
damage
to
the
environment
and
in
some
cases
an
oil
spill
could
not
be
entirely
cleaned
up.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
indeed
--
excuse
me.
the
coast
guard
has
construed
the
statute
to
require
that
that
a
penalty
be
paid
in
all
cases.
but
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
is
the
gravity
of
violation.
respondent
does
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
subsequent
clean-up
cannot
be
taken
into
account
but
in
this
case
that
reliance
is
wholly
misplaced
because
the
district
court
in
fact
cut
the
penalty
in
half
because
of
what
the
district
court
believed
was
the
diligence
of
the
respondent
cleaning
up.
and
i
have
been
informed
that
the
coast
guard
has
acquiesced
in
that
position
of
the
district
court
now
and
others.
and
now
it
does
take
into
account
the
administrative
assessment,
the
clean-up.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
one
point
should
be
clarified.
the
epa
has
taken
--
it
is
the
epa
who
enforces
that
new
provision,
although
i
do
not
know
that
this
as
yet
has
become
final
--
the
epa
has
expressed
an
opinion
in
earlier
regulations
that
that
is
intended
principally
for
hazardous
substances,
not
for
oil,
hazardous
substances,
chemicals
and
other
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
think
--
it
is
essentially
the
same
legal
issue
although
several
of
this
court's
decisions,
i
think
most
recently
in
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones,
has
suggested
that
the
penalty
is
so
disproportionate
to
the
conduct
for
which
the
penalty
is
attached
that
at
that
point
it
might
be
regarded
as
criminal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
statutory
language
both
in
the
civil
penalty
provision
involved
here
and
also
in
the
new
one
enacted
in
1978
both
specifically
provide
that
the
penalty
should
be
tailored
to
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
so
if
that
standard
is
rigidly
applied,
then
there
should
not
be
an
occasion
where
the
penalty
would
end
up
being
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
there
would
be
no
constitutional
question
because
of
the
specific
language
of
the
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
am
trying
--
i
am
not
sure
what
the
constitutional
objection
would
be
outside
of
the
self-incrimination
clause.
i
mean
i
don't
know
whether
there
might
be
some
fourth
amendment
issue
at
some
point.
but
it
might
be
possible,
for
example,
with
sophisticated
technology,
i
suppose,
to
have
a
monitor
on
speedometers
in
automobiles
that
would
measure
that,
which
would
have
the
effect
of
recording
on
behalf
of
the
individual.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
at
this
point
is
that
the
respondent
relies
to
a
considerable
extent
on
one
of
the
factors
mentioned
in
this
court's
decision
in
mendoza-martinez.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
an
expatriation
provision
under
the
immigration
act
for
persons
who
departed
the
country
to
avoid
military
service
was
criminal
and
one
of
the
factors
mentioned
in
mendoza-martinez
that
could
be
looked
to
in
discerning
congressional
intent
is
to
whether
a
statute
is
criminal
is
whether
the
conduct
regulated
by
the
ostensibly
regulatory
or
civil
sanction
is
otherwise
made
criminal.
we
agree
that
this
can
be
a
relevant
factor
but
in
this
case
it
happens
to
cut
the
other
way,
because
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
the
congress
--
as
it
has
under
the
tax
laws
and
others
for
example
--
can
attach
both
criminal
and
civil
sanctions
to
the
same
conduct.
and
so
where
here
congress
in
the
refusa
act
of
1899
has
made
the
discharge
of
pollutants
criminal
and
then
in
this
particular
statute
designates
the
penalty
as
civil
i
think
the
inference
can
only
be
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
you
don't
file
the
report,
you
are
subject
to
criminal
liabilities
for
non-filing.
right,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
in
mendoza-martinez,
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
the
conduct
was
otherwise
made
in
criminal
and
in
fact
cut
the
other
way
because
mendoza-martinez,
the
statute
involved
there
was
concerned
with
people
who
had
violated
the
selective
service
laws
were
criminally
liable
but
had
left
the
country
and
were
beyond
the
reach
of
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
made
it
unmistakably
clear
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
fill
a
gap
in
the
criminal
punishments
under
that
statute
by
saying
any
citizen
has
left
the
country
and
we
cannot
prosecute
him,
then
we
will
do
the
alternative
of
taking
away
his
citizenship.
and
so
while
that
is
a
factor,
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
which
way
it
cuts
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
again,
i
don't
think
this
raises
self-incrimination
problem,
because
it
wouldn't
be
criminal.
but
i
think
the
limitation
as
to
where
one
would
probably
be
a
due
process
limitation
if
the
sanction
for
failure
to
report
at
some
point
was
so
disproportionate
to
the
offense
of
not
reporting.
i
can
imagine
a
situation
for
example
in
which
a
serious
oil
shortage,
it
was
imperative
that
no
one
go
over
a
certain
speed
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
strong
public
interest
in
insuring
that
all
citizens
obeyed
that
particular
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
$5,000
would
be
a
particular
cutoff
point.
but
again,
in
the
case
of
discussing
whether
a
case
is
criminal,
for
example,
they
have
suggested
that
a
penalty
that
is
so
disproportionate
to
the
underlying
offense
is
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
the
court's
decision
in
clara
toledo,
for
example,
the
court
upheld
the
forfeiture
of
a
yacht
that
was
based
on
essentially
non--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
of
course
in
those
situations
there
is
often
a
provision
for
remission
or
mitigation
of
penalties
which
helps
to
undercut
the
harshness
of
the
penalty.
thank
you.
