it
wouldn't
ban

if
the
advertising
said
turn
out
your
lights
when
there
is

do
you
suppose
the
state
legislature
of
new
york
would
pass
a
law
saying
that
no
company
engaged
in
the
oil
business
shall
engage
in
promotional
advertising
that
would
tend
to
increase
the
consumption
of
oil
or
of
any
kind
of
petroleum
product?
justice

what
is
really
involved
in
that
question
i
think
is
how
much
does
your
argument
depend
upon
the
fact
that
these
are
regulated
monopolies.

posited

the
difference
is
rather
obvious.

would
be
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
question.

justice

stewart
no,
but
you
could,
you
might
say,
and
therefore
we
can
certainly
do
this.

this
shift
by
its
terms
applies
to
"all
electric
corporations."
justice

stewart
how
many
of
those
are
there
in
the
state
of
new

justice

stewart
well,
this
applies
by
its
terms
to
all
electric
corporation
--
justice

stewart
--
and
my
question
was
how
many
are
there.
justice

only

has
jurisdiction?
