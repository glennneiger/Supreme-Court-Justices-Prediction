mr.
taylor,
supposing
that
a
drug
manufacturer
sent
out
a
letter
saying
ask
your
doctor
to
prescribe
morphine
for
your
pain
you
have,
now
the
prescription
of
morphine
is
perfectly
legal
in
most
states,
but
you
do
have
to
get
it
by
prescription.
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
hypothesis
simply
says
the
drug
company
sends
to
the
occupant
of
every
house
"ask
your
doctor
to
prescribe
morphine"
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
so
it
would
be
in
compliance
with
the
state
law
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
would
be
a
matter
of
showing
if
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
restriction
and,
of
course,
ordinarily
the
standards
of
review
on
that
are
very
relaxed.
if
this
were
a
prohibition
which
began
to
impinge
on
existing
service
to
customers
and
reduced
them
o
a
bad
circumstance
in
terms
of
heat
why,
then
you
might
well
have
a
stricter
standard
of
review
to
show
the
necessity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
get
to
ohralik?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
new
york
from
making
every
single
enterprise
conducted
in
the
state
a
regulated
monopoly,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
wait
a
minute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
new
york
simply
have
a
system
of
state
socialism
where
the
state
owns
all
the
means
of
production
and
so
forth?
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
utilities
is
just
a
descriptive
term
for
those
types
of
businesses
that
the
state
has
chosen
to
heavily
regulate
and
franchise,
isn't
it,
and
there
is
no
magic
boundary
between
a
utility
and
a
kind
of
semi-free
enterprise
type
of
business.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
because
of
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
is
an
oil
man
or
an
electricity
man,
it
might
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
reject
then
mr.
p.
t.
barnum's
oft-quoted
maxim
that
no
one
ever
lost
a
dime
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
public?
