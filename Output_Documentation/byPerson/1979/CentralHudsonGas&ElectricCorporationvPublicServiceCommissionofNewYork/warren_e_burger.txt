we
will
hear
argument
next
in
central
hudson
gas
&
electric
v.
public
service
commission
of
new
york.
mr.
taylor,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
bar,
mr.
taylor,
ads
in
the
form
of
essays,
as
is
sometimes
done,
promoting
the
more
efficient
use
of
electrical
energy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
narrow
that
a
little
bit,
mr.
taylor.
suppose
the
notice
was
no
utility
shall
here-after
take
on
any
new
customers
for
heating,
space
heating
by
electricity,
any
problem
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it
is
no
different
from
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
analogy,
mr.
taylor,
in
a
rationing
program,
rationing
gasoline,
for
example,
with
coupons?
is
this
not
an
effort
to
equalize
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
to
hold
down
consumption
so
there
will
be
enough
to
reach
everybody?
is
there
any
analogy
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schiff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you
can't
economically?
you
can't
economically,
but
you
could
constitutionally,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
municipal
or
public
owned,
roughly?
two
or
three
or
twenty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
you
yielded
your
time,
mr.
schiff?m
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
is
the
commission's
position,
mr.
taylor,
that
the
commission
has
not
found
any
of
these
things?
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or,
alternatively,
the
commission
is
without
authority,
even
assuming
the
accuracy
of
those
claims
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
