mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mentioned
before,
this
case
arises
from
the
same
order
as
the
previous
one,
although
with
a
somewhat
different
history.
certainly
mr.
taylor
has
explained
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
imposed
the
ban
on
the
promotion
of
electricity
by
utilities.
i
want
to
say
that
our
ban
has
been
on
all
promotion
of
electricity
by
the
electric
utilities.
our
order
did
consider
in
some
detail
the
requests
by
some
of
the
utilities
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
promote
off-peak
uses
for
particularly
space
heating
which
is
in
the
form
of
--
in
two
forms,
one
is
electric
resistance
heating
and
the
other
is
in
terms
of
the
heat
pumps.
now,
the
primary
reason
for
this
ban
is
that
new
york
is
terribly
oil
dependent
and
any
time
an
additional
kilowatt
hour
of
electricity
is
generated
in
new
york,
at
just
about
any
time,
day
or
night,
winter
or
summer,
additional
oil
is
burned.
oil
is
what
burned
at
the
margin
in
new
york
state.
ninety
percent
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
will
tell
you,
we
have
not
--
that
is
a
more
difficult
question,
in
light
of
this
court's
first
amendment
cases.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
depends
very
substantially
on
the
fact
that
these
are
regulated
monopolies.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
let
me,
if
i
may,
say
why
i
think
this
is
different
and
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
this
case
the
basic
information
in
commercial
speech
cases
that
the
court
has
protected
is
really
saying
that
there
is
a
need
to
provide
price
information
to
customers.
that
was
true
in
the
prescription
drug
case,
it
was
true
in
the
routine
legal
services
case.
in
terms
of
the
oil
jobbers
advertising
as
to
what
the
costs
are
for
the
individual
jobbers,
you
will
have
again
price
information
of
that
type
being
provided.
actually
the
oil
jobbers
in
this
case
told
the
commission
they
would
be
glad
to
have
their
speech
restricted,
but
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
different
and
i
am
not
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
don't
have
to
--
i
guess
i
have
to
argue
this
case
and
i
think
there
are
compelling
reasons
here.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
know
what
this
court
would
decide
on
that
case
in
order
for
you
to
affirm
us
here,
so
i
am
not
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
think
it
is
too
iffy
because
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
it
here.
i
think
the
interests
--
the
court
has
looked
at
what
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
there
is
competition
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
absolutely,
there
are
suppliers
who
are
free
to
advertise,
the
appliance
dealers,
there
are
the
manufacturers
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
i
mean
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they
can
advertise
their
relative
advantages
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
and
there
are
appliance
dealers
who
can
promote
and
say
why
electric
heat
is
better
than
oil
heat.
the
reason
for
banning
the
promotion
by
the
electric
utilities
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
fact
--
well,
primarily.
i
mean
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
have
to
be
judged
in
the
context
that
this
is
a
regulated
monopoly,
that
even
though
there
is
competition
on
a
small
portion
of
the
regulated
company's
business,
and
my
understanding
is
that
central
hudson,
perhaps
8
percent
of
its
sales
are
involved
in
electric
heating,
although
that
figure
is
not
too
easy
to
come
by,
a
much
smaller
amount
involves
how
much
is
added
at
any
one
time
since
these
are
not
thing
that
are
added
very
quickly.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
can't
very
well
make
something
a
regulated
monopoly
if
the
business
is
not
essentially
monopolistic.
electric
utilities
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
we
could
regulate
them
but
not
as
monopolies.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
state
ownership,
i
suppose
we
could
have
that.
i
think,
yes,
i
suppose
we
could
have
that
but
that
is
not
what
is
involved
here.
in
the
case
of
the
utilities,
as
i
indicated
before,
the
state
has
imposed
an
obligation
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
historically,
the
electric
utilities
became
regulated
because
it
is
a
matter
of
economics
and
as
a
matter
of
esthetics,
it
made
sense
only
to
have
one
company
serving
one
area.
and
there
was
no
competition
for
most
of
its
services
and
there
is
no
competition
for
most
people
getting
electric
service.
if
you
want
electric
service,
you
have
one
place
to
go.
that
is
not
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
no,
it
is
not
because
of
the
state.
it
is
--
well,
it
may
be
because
of
the
state,
but
as
a
practical
matter
you
can't
really
function,
you
can't
have
two
sets
of
distribution
lines,
two
sets
of
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
constitutionally,
sure.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
utilities,
monopoly
utilities,
the
reason
the
state
has
regulated
them
is
a
matter
of
historically
because
utilities
really
requested
the
regulation
in
order
to
be
protected
from
having
public
power,
which
is
true
in
so
many
other
countries,
but
they
are
different
in
terms
of
how
they
operate
and
the
competition
that
we
have
here
is
very
limited.
the
court
of
appeals
was
perfectly
correct
in
at
least
recognizing
that
the
dominant
aspect
of
electric
utilities
was
serving
as
a
monopoly.
now,
in
terms
of
the
conservation
here,
the
reason
that
this
is
important,
we
think
that
having
utilities
promote
--
now,
by
promoting
it
is
not
giving
price
information,
it
is
essentially
saying
to
the
public,
go
out
and
use
electricity
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
supposed
to
be
telling
the
public
to
save
electricity.
and
the
more
oil
that
we
use,
the
more
expensive
it
gets.
the
oil
in
new
york
is
the
most
expensive
in
the
country,
i
suppose
because
it
is
the
lowest
sulfur
oil.
ninety
percent
or
more
than
90
percent
of
our
oils
comes
from
foreign
sources
because
that
is
the
kind
of
oil,
residual
oil
that
is
burned
in
our
generators.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
a
rate
problem,
at
least
in
new
york,
where
the
rates
unfortunately
are
probably
the
highest
in
the
country.
i
looked
this
up.
i
say
with
regret
that
the
average
price
used
at
the
time
of
highest
consumption,
which
is
basically
in
the
summer
time
in
the
areas
served
by
central
hudson
as
well
as
lilco,
is
priced
below
what
the
real
cost
to
the
society
is
or
what
the
consumer
is,
but
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
develop
the
marginal
costs.
we
haven't
had
all
the
information
or
the
equipment
that
is
necessary
to
do
that.
in
the
meantime,
to
have
people
add
these
services
on
the
basis
of
the
prices
that
are
now
being
charged,
encouraging
to
do
that,
promoting
it,
which
is
not
just
plain
advertising,
it
is
asking
them
to
add
that
service,
is
really
inherently
misleading
as
we
explain
in
our
brief.
now,
we
realize,
of
course,
that
in
banning
we
are
intruding
on
the
commercial
speech
rights,
the
first
amendment
considerations
that
were
considered
by
the
commission,
but
this
case
is
different
from
the
other
case
in
that
there
was
the
problem
that
consumers
could
only
get
the
price
information
of
prescription
drugs
practically
through
advertising.
here
the
price
information,
there
is
one
price
for
electricity,
it
is
public
knowledge.
anybody
can
get
it.
you
can
call
the
utility
or
the
appliance
dealers
who
can
advertise
this
electricity,
can
provide
it
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
you
don't
have
any
choice,
there
is
one
price.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
this
isn't
the
routine
legal
services
that
we
are
involved
with,
this
is
talking
qualitative
kind
of
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
this
is
on
the
promotion
of
electricity,
this
isn't
on
whether
they
are
promoting
--
this
ban,
the
only
thing
that
is
involved
here
is
the
promotion
by
advertising
of
electric
usage.
that
is
all
that
is
involved
here.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
political
advertising,
which
apparently
george
jones
perhaps
can't
be
promoted
in
any
event,
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
particular
order
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
you
can
promote
the
usage
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
of
electricity,
right.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
because
that
was
my
next
point,
that
the
utilities
are
really
not
uniquely
qualified
to
speak
on
that.
they
don't
sell
this
equipment,
they
are
just
selling
the
electricity.
the
entities
that
are
uniquely
qualified,
the
ones
that
are
comparable
to
the
pharmacies
are
the
appliance
dealers
or
the
manufacturers.
it
is
not
the
utilities.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
certainly
couldn't.
your
question
relates
to
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
that
would
be
--
i
would
really
doubt
that
we
could
do
it
except
in
cases
of
extreme
emergency,
but
we
certainly
haven't
attempted
to
do
that.
the
problem
here
--
one
of
the
things
the
commission
did
point
out
is
that
there
were
other
alternatives
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
your
honor,
the
reason
that
the
monopoly
aspect
of
this
is
very
important
is
that,
for
example,
it
might
be
beneficial
for
a
customer,
an
individual
customer
to
take
on
an
electric
heat
pump,
the
electric
heat
pump
is
normally
--
central
hudson
says
there
are
some
without
air
conditioning,
but
at
least
they
have
never
advised
us
of
that
--
normally
carry
with
it
air
conditioning
in
the
summer,
and
the
commission
found
that
this
would
result
in
air
conditioning
that
would
not
otherwise
happen.
the
commission
found
that
the
consequence
of
this
would
be
to
increase
the
rates
of
all
the
other
customers.
what
we
have
is
a
problem
that
perhaps
the
individual
customer
who
can
get
information
elsewhere
might
be
benefited
by
taking
a
particular
appliance,
but
the
rest
of
the
customers
are
hurt
and
this
is
very
different,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
from
the
area
of
free
competition
of
the
pharmacist
or
others
who
aren't
going
to
engage
in
the
promotion
unless
they
think
it
is
going
to
be
overall
good
for
them.
the
company
may
think
it
is
overall
good
for
them,
but
you
have
to
remember
that
most
of
the
cost
of
this,
the
tab
will
be
picked
up
through
their
monopoly
rates.
there
is
no
way
of
really
separating
the
consequences
of
the
kind
of
promotion
they
do.
this
is
why
the
fact
that
this
is
a
monopoly
makes
this
case
very
different
from
any
other
case
that
you
have
previously
considered
in
this
free
speech
area.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
you
see,
the
resistance
heating
problem
is
that
it
uses
substantially
more
oil
and
there
really
is
not
much
argument
and
the
situation
in
new
york
may
be
different
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
when
we
have
conversions
to
coal,
but
we
don't
have
that
now.
it
is
competition
at
that
level,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
in
this
case
the
utility
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
problem
is
when
the
utility
does
this
advertising,
the
extra
costs
from
using
additional
oil
and
from
the
rate
structure
problems
which
the
utilities
can
equally
work
on
with
the
commission,
that
problem
is
one
that
is
going
to
be
to
the
detriment
of
the
rest
of
the
consumers,
so
you
really
have
to
say,
well,
we
can
let
them
advertise
to
a
fare-thee-well
and
the
other
consumers
be
damned,
we
can't
control
that
even
if
you
can't
control
it
by
putting
in
a
--
suppose
we
said,
well,
you
can
promote
but
put
in
a
label
that
this
is
dangerous
to
the
general
rates,
that
wouldn't
help
the
other
consumers
because
it
is
encouraging
that
use
which
in
itself
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
is
part
of
it
because
--
no,
we
want
to
save
oil.
we
are
also
troubled
that
any
promotion,
the
commission
found
that
any
promotion
that
is
done,
including
for
heat
pumps
--
and
this
is
mass
media
advertising
that
we
are
talking
about,
because
we
are
not
talking
about
one-to-one
promotion,
this
sort
of
doesn't
go
to
that
--
is
going
to
give
them
mixed
signals
that
electric
heating
is
going
to
be
advertised
primarily
in
the
summertime
when
it
would
be
installed
or
frequently
in
the
summertime,
and
the
consumers
say
how
do
the
utilities
tell
us
it
is
okay,
how
can
we
accept
the
fact
that
we
shouldn't
be
using
electricity
for
other
purposes.
this
is
one
ball
of
wax.
the
utility
is
one
entity
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
disaggregate
that
and
i
--
now,
there
is
an
argument
here
on
over-breadth
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
that
the
consumer
is
intelligent
and
we
think
that
an
intelligent
consumer
is
going
to
accept
the
fact
that
if
a
utility
is
promoting
generally,
that
it
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says
about
conservation.
i
mean
i
think
that
is
what
i
would
think
an
intelligent
consumer
would
be
doing.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
the
consumer
is
reasonably
intelligent.
i
think
that
we
point
out
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
really
compartmentalize
this,
but
that
is
why
the
fact
that
the
ban
is
being
--
it
does
not
apply
to
other
dealers,
to
appliance
dealers
where
you
do
not
have
mixed
signals.
we
think
that
it
does
provide
consumers
with
a
great
deal
of
information
and
that
they
are
not
really
being
deprived
of
essential
information.
i
would
like
to
get
to
an
important
point
i
think
and
that
is
the
position
that
central
hudson
has
taken
that,
regardless
of
how
good
the
reasons
are
that
we
have
for
banning
it,
we
can't
ban
promotional
advertising
because
we
haven't
banned
the
use
of
electricity
and
we
haven't
banned
electric
heat
pumps
or
resistance
heating.
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
that
kind
of
a
conclusion.
this
court
in
the
virginia
pharmacy
case
said
we
are
confident
that
people
will
not
--
that
doctors
will
not
over-prescribe,
but
you
did
also
say
in
the
texan
optometry
case
that
the
fact
that
the
state
wanted
to
limit
the
commercial
optometrist
or
had
not
cut
out
commercial
optometrists
did
not
mean
that
you
couldn't
put
reasonable
restrictions
on
that
in
terms
of
the
trade
name.
and
i
think
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
discouraging
or
not
encouraging
the
use
of
electricity.
it
may
be
one
way
of
permitting
people
to
use
that
electricity
without
excessively
pushing
up
the
rates
or
without
putting
an
undue
pressure
on
the
oil
requirements,
and
that
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
draconian
means
of
saying,
well,
some
people
can't
be
attached.
now,
i
would
be
terribly
troubled
with
saying
that
new
customers
couldn't
attach
or
new
people
couldn't
move,
and
i
think
it
is
just
plain
absurd
to
say
that
you
can't
put
some
limits
on
promotion
simply
because
you
have
not
banned
the
use
of
electricity
or
restricted
the
use
of
electricity.
i
think
this
court
has
certainly
used
a
common
sense
approach
in
these
cases
of
commercial
speech
and
frankly
i
am
appalled
to
say
that
we
have
to
be
so
draconian
that
the
utilities
can't
be
prevented
from
encouraging
their
usage.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
certainly
--
i
don't
think
the
facts
would
warrant
trying
to
be
that
draconian
at
this
time.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
certainly
did
that
back
in
'73,
when
the
oil
was
practically
running
out
in
the
con
ed
territory
and
some
other
places,
we
recognized
that
there
were
alternative
means
of
doing
it
and
that
restricting
promotion
was
a
better
means
of
doing
that
than
saying
you
simply
couldn't
--
that
you
close
down
the
electric
system
alternately
throughout
the
system.
there
are
common
sense
differences
in
the
commercial
speech
area
and
--
well,
regardless
of
commercial
speech,
i
think
--
but
especially
in
the
commercial
area,
where
you
may
have
to
take
other
alternative
means,
if
this
is
a
sensible
means,
more
sensible
than
saying
absolute
ban,
i
would
think
that
this
makes
very
good
sense
in
first
amendment
terms,
but
especially
because
of
the
minimal
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
there
are
seven
--
there
are
basically
seven
privately
owned
utilities
and
--
well,
this
applies
to
the
seven
electric
privately
owned
utility
companies
in
the
state.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they
are
all
the
ones
that
we
regulate.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
there
are
some
municipally
owned
which
provide
a
very
small
service
in
new
york
state.
there
are
seven
that
serve
virtually
the
whole
state,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
there
may
be
a
couple
of
very
small
ones,
but
basically
this
applies
to
the
seven.
there
are
seven
basic
companies
that
serve
new
york
state.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
throughout
the
state,
yes.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
more
in
the
nature
of
twenty.
it
is
a
peculiar
setup.
they
are
not
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
because
they
get
their
power
from
the
power
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
by
statute
we
do
not
regulate
them.
but
unlike
some
other
places,
there
is
very
little
electric
power
sold
by
the
municipals
in
new
york.
i
do
want
to
say
that
in
the
past
we
had
restrictions
on
the
promotion
of
telephone,
we
still
have
some
restriction
on
the
promotion
of
gas
service.
we
imposed
restrictions
on
telephone
promotion
in
the
early
seventies
when
service
in
down-state
new
york
was
just
incredibly
poor.
as
that
service
improved,
the
restrictions
got
lifted
and
the
commission
has
been
flexible
and
has
adjusted
to
the
exigencies
of
the
situation.
and
if
a
showing
can
be
made
that
promotion
in
fact
is
going
to
conserve
energy,
which
it
has
never
been
made
to
us,
the
commission's
order
says
we
are
ready
to
relax
our
ban,
we're
not
interested
in
banning
for
the
sake
of
banning
it.
we
think
that
is
basically
a
bad
idea,
if
we
can
avoid
it.
in
gas,
we
have
been
relaxing
it
as
more
gas
has
become
available.
and
i
think
in
viewing
the
commission's
experience
in
this,
i
think
that
is
something
also
to
keep
in
mind.
but
what
the
utilities
say,
let
us
go
ahead
and
do
what
we
ever
want
to
do,
and
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
what
effect
it
has
on
the
rate
payers,
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
competition
on
a
small
part
of
this
business
does
not
protect
the
consumers
generally,
it
is
an
important
reason
to
approve
the
ban
on
promotion
here.
the
utility
status
is
vital.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
am
finished
unless
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor.
