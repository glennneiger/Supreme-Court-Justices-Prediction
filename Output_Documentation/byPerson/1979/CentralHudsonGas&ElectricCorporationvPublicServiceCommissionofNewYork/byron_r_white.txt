justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
he
state
said
we
want
to
cut
down
the
use
of
energy
in
this
state
so
we
are
going
to
somehow
say
you
can't
sell
to
any
one
customer
more
than
a
certain
amount
or
you
can't
sell
any
more
that
you
sold
him
last
month
or
something
like
that.
i
suppose
you
would
accept
that
as
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
get
past
the
statutory
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
other
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
wouldn't
be
any
constitutional
problem,
would
there,
assuming
that
the
state
statute
clearly
authorized
it,
if
the
utilities
commission
could
say
no
electric
utility
in
this
state
shall
take
on
any
new
customers
for
the
next
twelve
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
no
constitutional
problem
of
any
kind,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
nevertheless
say
that
the
state
may
not
achieve
an
equivalent
or
roughly
the
same
end
by
telling
the
company
not
to
advertise
the
use
of
electricity.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
has
decided
that
they
have
a
very
good
reason
for
limiting
th
use
of
electricity.
they
considered
very
heavily
putting
a
quota
on
or
limit
or
a
ban
of
new
customers,
but
they
just
thought
they
would
limit
the
promotional
activities
of
the
company
if
for
no
other
reason
to
save
the
new
customers
money,
the
company
money
and
it
would
have
an
equivalent
effect.
but
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree,
mr.
taylor,
that
if
you
thought
the
state
was
giving
a
compelling
interest,
was
using
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
this
restriction,
that
it
would
be
all
right?
or
do
you
just
say
that
you
just
can't
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
suppose
the
state
just
out
and
out
says,
well,
we
offer
you
a
compelling
interest,
we
don't
know
of
any
more
compelling
interest
than
to
save
energy
and
we
think
this
is
an
effective
way
of
saving
energy,
is
that
--
of
course,
you
disagree
that
that
would
be
a
compelling
interest,
i
suppose,
or
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
didn't
think
your
advertising
was
effective,
you
wouldn't
really
be
worrying
very
much,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
it
is
effective
or
you
wouldn't
be
spending
your
money
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
would
be
unsatisfied
if
just
the
over-broad
portions
were
clipped
off
of
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
dissatisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
over-breadth
you
think
--
do
you
think
over-breadth
applies
right
across
the
board
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
be
our
rationale
if
we
said,
well,
we
think
the
state's
justification
is
saving
energy,
we
think
that
is
a
compelling
interest,
then
what
do
we
say?
we
say,
well
even
so,
this
is
invalid
because
is
isn't
effective?
the
state
thinks
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
state
does,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
must
we
disagree
with
them
to
side
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
you
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
within
that
broad
authorization
the
commission
perhaps
comes
up
with
a
much
narrower
justification
and
says
what
we
are
really
talking
about
is
saving
energy?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
state
suggested
any
other
reason
for
doing
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
this
is
just
in
the
terms
of
commercial
speech?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
ban
would
prevent
the
company
from
communicating
about
anything
that
is
controversial,
whether
it
has
anything
to
do
with
their
business
or
not
--
please
vote
for
george
jones
for
governor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
by
refusing
to
answer
earlier,
you
would
agree
that
you
could
not
prohibit
them
from
advertising
the
advantages
of
using
their
equipment?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
my
question
of
could
the
legislature
put
some
kind
of
an
oil
conservation
board
into
effect
that
would
censor
advertising
generally
that
tended
to
promote
the
usage
of
oil.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
have
two
different
cases,
one
in
which
you
say
you
can't
advertise
where
the
consumer
has
no
alternative
choice
such
as
providing
electricity
for
burning
lighting
or
something
like
that,
but
why
do
you
have
to
extend
the
ban
all
the
way
into
areas
in
which
there
is
a
legitimate
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
electricity
is
the
most
efficient
energy
source?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
arguing
that
because
you
could
be
so
draconian
you
can
have
this
much
narrower
but
effective
ban?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
urging
that
the
justification
they
submit
or
they
tender
is
insufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
hear
him
concede.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
your
point
is
that
even
if
it
is
costly,
this
restriction
is
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
to
disagree
with
the
commission
then.
