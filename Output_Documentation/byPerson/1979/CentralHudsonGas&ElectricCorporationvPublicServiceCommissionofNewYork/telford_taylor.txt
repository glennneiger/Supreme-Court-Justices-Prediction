mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
also
involves
an
order
of
the
public
service
commission,
it
is
in
our
brief
on
page
3,
and
is
mercifully
short
"all
electric
corporations
are
hereby
prohibited
from
promoting
the
use
of
electricity
through
the
use
of
advertising.
i
think
the
court
will
readily
see
that
the
constitutional
questions
raised
here
are
distinct
from
those
in
the
case
that
has
just
been
heard.
the
bill
insert
ban
closes
a
particular
channel
to
speech
on
public
issues
this
is
a
complete
ban
on
speech
described
as
promotional
advertising.
that,
of
course,
falls
within
the
general
category
of
speech.
that
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
has
been
called
commercial
speech,
but
i
think
it
will
appear
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
that
the
line
here
between
commercial
speech
and
other
speech
is
not
as
clear
as
it
has
been
in
some
of
the
other
cases
in
this
court.
now,
i
think
i
should
say
a
word
about
the
genesis
of
this
order
because
it
is
different
from
the
chronology
of
the
bill
insert
case.
the
ban
there
in
the
same
language
as
on
page
3
was
enunciated
by
the
commission
in
a
summary
emergency
fashion
in
december
of
1973
at
the
time
of
the
arab
oil
boycott
following
the
arab-israeli
war,
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
genuine
and
acknowledge
belief
of
a
shortage
of
oil
which
might
not
enable
the
utilities
to
continue
service,
and
it
was
put
in
on
that
basis
at
that
time,
together
with
an
order
for
voltage
reduction.
months
passed,
the
shortage
eased
and
the
voltage
restriction
was
restored,
but
the
promotional
ban
was
retained
in
effect.
in
1976,
the
commission
inaugurated
a
proceeding
to
review
whether
the
promotional
ban
should
be
continued.
central
hudson
and
other
companies
urged
that
it
should
be
lifted.
we
urged
that
unsuccessfully,
and
after
losing
before
the
commission
and
rehearing
denied,
this
litigation
was
commenced
in
the
new
york
state
courts
and,
of
course,
therefore
is
here
on
appeal
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
i
might
also
just
mention
to
the
court
that
a
brief
has
been
filed
here
in
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
long
island
lighting
company.
that
was
a
litigation
started
in
the
federal
courts,
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
in
which
judge
pratt
ruled
that
this
promotional
ban
was
indeed
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
but
upheld
the
bill
insert
ban.
that
case
is
pending
and
has
been
argued
in
the
second
circuit
but
has
not
been
decided.
now,
before
i
come
to
the
two
matters
that
i
think
are
very
basic
here,
i
would
like
to
mention
three
things
which
either
are
or
should
be
uncontroverted
and
which
i
think
may
clear
up
a
couple
of
things
and
avoid
the
necessity
for
colloquy.
in
the
first
place,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
about
who
pays
for
promotional
advertising.
there
is
federal
legislation
declaring
federal
standards
which
require
that
promotional
advertising
be
paid
for
by
the
shareholders
and
not
the
rate
payers.
the
commission's
own
view
is
to
the
same
effect
and
therefore
we
do
not
have
here
any
question
about
the
source
of
funds
for
promotional
advertising.
the
owners
of
the
company
bear
it.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
the
ban
is
phrased
in
terms
not
of
consumption
of
oil
or
energy
resource
but
the
amount
of
electricity
and
therefore
if
we
urge
by
the
use
of
an
appliance
or
in
any
other
way
something
which
will
increase
the
use
of
electricity,
even
though
it
might
be
a
net
saving
of
energy,
it
comes
within
the
ban.
i
will
be
coming
in
more
detail
to
that
point
in
a
few
moments.
mr.
telford
taylor
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
you're
quite
right.
if
the
use
reduces
the
amount
of
electricity
used,
it
is
not
within
the
ban.
the
promotional
ban
is
defined
as
anything
which
might
be
expected
to
increase
the
use
of
electricity.
in
the
second
place,
neither
the
commission
nor
any
other
authority,
state
or
federal,
has
done
anything
which
prohibits
the
underlying
activity
here,
that
is
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
distribution,
sale
and
use
of
electricity.
it
is
perfectly
lawful,
and
the
commission's
brief
said
that
they
haven't
even
tried
to
discourage
the
use
of
electricity
for
heating
and
therefore
it
is
beyond
argument
i
think
that
the
effect
of
this
ban
is
to
with-hold
from
the
public
information
about
an
activity
which
is
perfectly
lawful.
in
the
third
place,
although
this
ban
in
its
origin
in
december
of
1973
was
based
on
an
actual
shortage
of
oil,
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
commission's
decision
in
1977
which
continues
the
ban.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
there
is
nothing
in
my
opponent's
brief,
there
is
nothing
which
indicates
any
present
or
approximate
shortage
of
oil.
the
conservation
theory
which
has
been
invoked
in
support
of
the
order
is
rather
that
there
is
a
continued
dependence
on
foreign
oil.
that
is
the
conservation
factor
which
is
primarily
relied
on
in
the
commission's
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore,
of
course,
i
will
be
addressing
that
value
which
is
invoked
to
support
the
ban
i
hope
before
i
sit
down.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
if
it
was
encouraging
him
to
get
it
without
a
prescription,
it
would,
of
course,
be
advocating
unlawful
conduct
and
i
suppose
it
would
fall
within
the
traditional
category
of
speech
which
can
be
limited.
but
the
point
of
my
making
my
so-called
point
two
there
was
precisely
that
there
is
nothing
unlawful
about
the
use
of
the
electricity
the
sale
or
the
distribution
and
indeed
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
encouraging
the
use
of
what
are
called
controlled
substances,
well
known
to
be
dangerous.
it
is
very
much
like,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
take
it
the
tobacco
ban
on
advertising
tobacco
which
is
lawful
to
smoke,
which
your
honors
did
uphold
in
the
tobacco
case.
of
course,
the
nature
of
using
morphine
and
the
nature
of
using
electric
heating
is
different
as
night
from
day
in
terms
of
general
opinion
about
whether
this
is
good
or
bad.
may
i
come
to
the
two
points
which
seem
to
me
of
the
greatest
importance
here
and
which
i
think
go
further
than
anything
else
to
show
why
the
court
below
and
the
commission
have
fallen
into
constitutional
error
here.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
these
two
things
i
am
about
to
mention
led
the
court
to
say
that
general
hudson's
first
amendment
rights
are
in
this
case
at
the
"nadir"
and
having
them
put
them
in
that
low
a
state,
of
course,
it
was
unnecessary
to
scrutinize
very
carefully
the
value
factor
invoked
to
support
the
ban
because
so
low
a
category
is
placed
on
the
speech
itself.
now,
the
most
important
point
here
i
believe
is
in
our
brief
on
page
15.
we
have
quoted
the
governing
paragraph
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which,
as
your
honors
would
see,
treats
this
case
as
simply
one
where,
since
we
have
a
monopoly
in
the
distribution
of
electric
energy
and
since
the
price
is
controlled
by
the
--
the
rates
are
controlled
by
the
commission,
that
there
can
be
no
value
in
discussion
about
the
use
of
electricity.
consumers
have
no
choice
regarding
the
source
of
their
electric
power,
the
price
of
electricity
simply
may
not
be
reduced
by
competitive
shopping.
well,
your
honors,
we
say
that
that
demonstrates
a
very
fundamental
misconception
about
what
the
speech
involved
in
this
case
is.
of
course,
it
is
true
that
the
price
of
electric
energy
to
the
rate
payer
is
regulated.
of
course,
it
is
true
that,
as
a
substantial
matter,
our
company
is
the
only
source
of
it.
but
it
wholly
overlooks
the
fact
that
people
don't
take
electric
energy
for
its
own
sake
because
it
can
be
turned
into
heat
and
light
and
power
and
to
goods
of
that
kind,
and
that
in
terms
especially
of
temperature
control,
of
heating
and
cooling,
the
company's
share
of
this
is
not
only
not
a
monopoly,
it
is
very
much
a
minority
share.
there
is
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
that
question
can't
be
answered
fully
without
taking
account
both
of
statutory
matters
which
i
don't
think
are
relevant
here
and
constitutional
matters.
there
would
be
statutory
problems
about
the
commission's
authority
to
do
that.
what
you
suggest
has
been
specifically
authorized
by
statute
in
the
case
of
gas,
but
not
in
the
case
of
electricity.
now,
if
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
was
going
to
go
past
it
right
away.
if
the
statutory
question
is
resolved,
why,
then,
of
course,
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
problem.
there
would
still
be
--
mr.
telford
taylor
if
a
satisfactory
substance
showing
could
be
made
in
support
of
that
regulation,
the
answer
of
course
is
they
could
do
that,
assuming
the
statutory
questions
were
cleared
up,
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
telford
taylor
if
a
satisfactory
factual
basis,
there
are
none.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
right.
mr.
telford
taylor
no
different
problem,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
this
would
still
be
a
restriction
on
the
activity
itself
it
would
not
raise
a
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes
indeed
because
the
situation
we
have
now
is
that
the
public
or
the
consumer
is
entirely
free
to
use
electric
energy,
the
company
is
entirely
free
to
make
it
available,
there
are
many
alternative
ways
of
using
it,
some
of
which
are
more
effective
than
others,
and
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
don't
believe
they
can
do
that,
mr.
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
because
that
rests
on
achieving
this
consequence
by
keeping
the
public
in
ignorance
to
matters
they
are
entitled
to
know.
the
option
of
electric
energy
is
not
an
offensive
one
or
an
unlawful
one,
it
is
one
which
the
commission
has
deliberately
left
open,
it
has
not
found
a
basis
for
doing
the
rationing
restriction
that
you
suppose
and
under
those
circumstances
i
think
they
can't
say
to
speak
put
a
slow
brake
on
it
by
the
device
of
holding
this
information
from
the
public.
in
all
the
other
commercial
speech
cases
of
recent
vintage,
there
have
been
arguments
made
to
show
that
a
policy
might
be
furthered
but
in
those
cases
the
balances
had
to
be
weighed
and
the
policy
has
been
found
insufficient,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
case
here,
too.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
will.
yes,
mr,
justice
rehnquist.
well,
to
complete
my
point
there,
since
the
commission
--
the
court,
in
other
words,
in
this
passage
on
page
15,
wholly
mistook
the
nature
of
the
market
which
is
involved
here.
the
monopoly
and
the
supply
of
electric
energy
does
not
mean
at
all
that
the
company
is
not
in
sharp
competition
with
other
energy
sources.
now,
the
facts
and
circumstances
about
the
relative
merits
of
these
energy
sources
are
matters
of
public
interest.
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
i
said
that
in
this
case
the
line
between
the
commercial
speech
and
the
so-called
controversial
speech
is
a
thin
one
because
advertising
which
would
tell
the
consumer
what
the
benefit
of
heat
pumps
are,
what
the
benefits
and
detriments
of
electric
space
heating
are
is
information
or
public
interest
and
of
great
interest
to
the
consumer,
and
therefore
the
whole
approach
to
the
advertising
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken.
now,
the
other
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
would
seem
to
me
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place,
this
would
bring
me
to
the
fourth
point
in
my
brief,
that
if
this
were
regarded
as
an
equalizing
measure,
it
is
a
strange
one
indeed
because
75
percent
or
more
of
the
heating
is
by
home
oil
furnaces
and
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
advertising
and
promotion
of
heat
derived
from
that
source.
it
is
limited
to
the
distribution
of
electric
energy
and
therefore
far
from
it
being
an
equalizing
thing,
it
is
a
discriminatory
thing
because
only
this
one
relatively
small
side
of
the
energy
picture
is
covered.
the
other
matter
on
which
it
seems
to
us
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
commission
have
been
led
astray
is
because,
in
addition
to
the
point
i
have
just
discussed,
they
have
relied
here
heavily
on
the
thought
that
because
central
hudson
is
a
regulated
public
utility,
that
by
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
our
first
amendment
rights
are
less.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
belotti
case
had
laid
at
rest
that
point
of
view.
of
course,
i
am
aware
that
that
case
was
decided
by
a
closely
decided
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
area
of
disagreement
in
the
belotti
case
has
much
to
do
with
what
is
before
the
court
now.
in
the
belotti
case,
the
state
value
invoked
to
limit
the
corporate
speech
was
itself
in
the
nature
of
a
first
amendment
value,
the
idea
of
a
prophylactic
rule
that
would
prevent
public
discussion
from
being
dominated
by
corporate
resources,
and
the
court
had
to
strike
a
balance
between
those
and
they
disagreed
on
how
to
strike
the
balance.
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
what
is
being
invoked
on
the
other
side
here
is
not
of
the
same
character
or
stripe
at
all
and
therefore
the
considerations
in
the
belotti
case
that
led
to
the
division
in
the
court
don't
seem
to
be
of
bearing
here.
certainly
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
belotti
case
that
both
the
majority
and
minority
thought
that
corporate
entities
do
have
the
rights
of
commercial
speech
and
in
the
majority
opinion
the
standard
to
be
used
was
exacting
scrutiny,
both
of
the
dissents
recognized
the
same
thing,
and
indeed
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
strongly
suggested
that
corporate
rights
in
the
commercial
area
might
well
be
greater
than
the
political
area
because
of
the
closer
nexus
with
the
corporation's
own
business.
in
that
connection,
can
i
remark
in
conclusion
here
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
that
we
have
here
none
of
the
factors
which
the
court
has
referred
to
in
some
of
these
cases,
the
common
sense
differences
between
commercial
speech
and
other
speech.
we
have
none
of
the
factors
which
the
court
has
mentioned
as
reasons
for
giving
commercial
speech
a
lesser
degree
of
protection.
this
order
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
speech
is
deceptive
or
misleading
or
anything
of
that
kind.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
overreaching
solicitation,
as
in
ohralik.
there
are
several
cases,
including
friedman
v.
rogers,
in
which
the
court
has
tabulated
these
distinctive
features
of
commercial
speech
and
none
of
them
are
present
here
and
therefore
for
all
those
reasons
that
i
have
now
covered,
we
strongly
urge
that
the
speech
in
this
case
is
highly
akin
to
public
issue
discussion,
that
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case
why
the
same
standard
should
not
be
applied
to
speech
that
was
applied
in
the
belotti
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
of
course
not,
your
honor
--
excuse
me
for
putting
it
that
way.
but
i
would
suppose
that
in
any
case
if
you
come
forward
with
a
sufficiently
compelling
reason,
that
the
amendment
gives
way.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
do
not
at
all
dispute
the
idea
that
the
conservation
of
energy
is
a
great
value.
whether
the
means
you
used
here
display
a
means
calculated
to
serve
the
compelling
interest
is
another
matter.
the
point
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
make
so
far,
mr.
justice
white,
is
--
mr.
telford
taylor
of
course,
the
advertising
must
be
effective
--
mr.
telford
taylor
right.
the
advertising
which,
as
our
brief
indicates,
we
desire
to
do,
the
advertising
of
heat
pumps,
is
not
the
kind
of
advertising
which
will
increase
the
net
consumption
of
energy.
and
of
course,
one
of
our
complaints
against
the
order
is
that
in
that
sense
it
is
over-broad
and
it
is
indeed
the
over-broad
portion
which
most
directly
affects
us
because
there
are
electrical
devices,
including
the
heat
pump,
now
available
which
very
greatly
diminishes
the
use
of
electrical
energy
and
would
not
increase
the
use
of
foreign
oil.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
would
be
dissatisfied.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
would
be
dissatisfied,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
we
believe
the
over-breadth
doctrine
is
available
in
this
case
because
it
is
not
a
situation
where
we
would
come
within
the
legitimate
scope
of
the
statute
in
a
complaint
that
it
might
apply
to
someone
else.
indeed,
here
the
over-breadth
part
is
the
part
that
specially
and
immediately
affects
us.
but
frankly,
in
answer
to
your
question,
no,
we
would
not
be
satisfied
because
we
believe
that
the
order
is
invalid
insofar
as
it
applies
to
resistance
heating
or
other
uses
and
for
the
same
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no
other
state
does,
and
nether
does
the
federal
government.
this
is
not
based
on
shortage
of
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
but
i
take
it
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
you
must
find
that
assertion
that
this
would
measurably
further
conservation
is
not
so
here.
this
is
not
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
because
we
still
have
the
over-breadth
argument
and
we
still
have
another
argument
which
in
point
three
of
our
brief,
which
we
think
is
equally
compelling.
the
statute
here
is
the
orthodox
kind
of
public
utility
statute
with
only
the
standard
of
public
interest,
public
welfare
in
it.
it
can
be
not
seriously
contended
that
the
legislature
has
ever
intended
to
convey
on
the
commission
the
powers
to
regulate
speech.
of
course,
the
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
under
review
here,
but
the
fact
the
court
has
given
that
construction
that
the
commission
is
vested
with
powers
to
limit
speech
does
inevitably
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
standard
for
it
is
adequate,
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
not,
that
the
standard
for
regulating
speech
must
be
a
good
deal
more
precise
than
that
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
context
or
general
application
of
the
statute
which
gives
any
guide
here
sufficient
for
first
amendment
purposes.
so
that
is
another
reason
why
on
which
basis
you
would
not
have
--
mr.
telford
taylor
under
the
question
of
the
standard
though,
what
they
have
done
here
is
only
one
thing
that
they
might
do
for
lack
of
the
standard,
and
also
the
conservation
is
not
the
only
point
the
commission
is
making,
of
course.
they
are
also
asserting
the
right
to
control
promotional
advertising
because
of
its
effect
on
the
rate
structure,
an
area
in
which
they
have
full
powers
under
their
right
powers
to
deal
with
it
in
other
ways.
so
that
the
assertion
of
power
here
by
the
commission
is
pretty
open-ended,
mr.
justice
white,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
lack
of
the
standard
is
fatal.
may
i
come
back,
if
i
may,
in
conclusion,
to
the
matter
of
conservation
because
i
think
this
is
crucial.
since
the
matter
is
not
one
of
shortage
of
oil
but
of
continued
dependence
on
foreign
oil,
we
have
a
problem
which
is
primarily
a
national
problem.
the
federal
decision
is
a
considered
one,
the
matter
of
prohibiting
promotional
advertising
was
raised,
the
committee
report
quite
specifically
says
it
is
not
intended
to
accomplish
that.
no
other
state
except
oklahoma
has
attempted
this,
and
there
the
state
court
immediately
held
it
unconstitutional.
so
we
think
that
that
is
highly
relevant
in
determining
the
substantially
of
invoking
conservation.
of
course,
conservation
itself
is
a
compelling
interest
but
i
don't
think
it
all
follows
from
that
--
and
look
at
the
linmark
case,
where
the
state
objective
was
desegregated
housing,
admittedly
an
important
one
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
they
have,
even
more
inadequate
than
the
first,
mr.
justice
white.
if
i
may,
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
reply.
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
make
an
additional
comment
with
respect
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stevens
addressed
to
mr.
schiff,
suggesting
a
newly
developed
housing
area,
should
it
be
resistance
heating
or
some
other
form,
and
mr.
schiff's
reply
was
that
resistance
heating
would
take
more
oil.
that
of
course
may
be
true
if
the
energy
is
electrically
fired,
but
may
i
call
your
attention
to
mr.
schiff's
brief
which
says
on
page
18
that
the
commission
has
never
taken
the
position
that
electric
space
heating
should
be
discouraged,
and
also
says
that
there
is
no
sufficient
basis
for
any
action
banning
electric
heating.
that
is
certainly
true,
there
is
no
shortage
of
oil,
there
is
no
shortage
of
electric
capacity,
there
is
no
need
for
rationing.
these
circumstances
which
might
call
those
powers
into
play
are
not
here.
there
are
advantages
in
electric
space
heating
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
what
it
says,
yes,
sir.
the
advantages,
of
course,
of
electric
heating
are
that
it
is
clear,
its
use
in
the
home
is
pollution
free,
you
don't
have
gas
trucks
running
over
the
place
and
polluting
and
burning
up
gas,
and
we
say
that
under
these
circumstances
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
concededly
so.
it
is
concededly
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
read
it
though
at
page
18
of
his
brief
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
restrictions
on
electric
heating,
and
we
say
if
that
is
so
that
you
cannot
put
a
sort
of
slow
brake
on
it
by
forbidding
the
public
to
be
informed
about
the
advantages
that
are
there.
now,
one
other
thing
which
i
would
like
to
mention,
the
notion
that
if
we
promote
electric
energy
we
are
giving
the
public
misleading
signals
about
conservation.
you
will
find
in
our
reply
brief
an
example
of
what
has
been
done
here.
we
have
save
energy
programs
in
which
various
ways
of
saving
energy
are
indicated
to
the
public
and
by
display,
and
so
forth,
accompanied
however
by
information
about
the
heat
pump.
the
commission
has
questioned
our
doing
that
under
this
ban.
there
is
in
fact
a
vagueness
problem
with
this
ban,
too,
though
i
have
not
stressed
it
because
i
think
there
are
more
fundamental
arguments,
but
there
is
that
vagueness
argument
and
the
fact
is
that,
despite
his
adverse
comments
on
the
heat
pump,
the
new
york
legislature
has
recently
required
us
to
finance
their
installation
under
some
circumstances
and
have
specified
the
heat
pump
as
an
energy
saving
device.
so
i
think
the
gist
of
my
very
brief
reply
is
that
with
all
respect,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
is
over-simplified
to
say
that
any
promotion
is
going
to
be
energy
costly.
it
is
not.
some
of
it
is
going
to
be
energy
economical
and
the
order
ignores
that.
mr.
telford
taylor
my
point
is
that
the
additional
costliness
is
very
incorrect
and
difficult
to
quantify
and
neither
federal
nor
state-wise
has
any
other
authority
found
any
necessity
for
this
sort
of
limitation.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
urge
you
to
find
the
invocation
of
the
value
in
sufficient
because
it
will
not
accomplish
measurably
its
purpose.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
other
arguments
i
have
advanced.
