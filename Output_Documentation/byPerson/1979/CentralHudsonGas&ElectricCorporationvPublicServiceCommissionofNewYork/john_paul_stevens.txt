paul

i
understand
that
it
is
different.
i
am
just
curious
about
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
want
to
answer
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
competition
for
items
such
as
heat
pumps?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
their
suppliers
of
those
competing
items
that
are
not
regulated
by
your
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
people
can
advertise
oil
furnaces?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can
advertise
the
relative
advantages
over
electric
heating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
advertising
may
promote
the
consumption
of
oil,
i
assume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure.
i
take
it
the
reason
you
decline
to
answer
my
question
is
you
rest
exclusively
on
the
regulated
monopoly
character
of
this
industry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
your
point
that
the
information
is
generally
available
about
priced
and
the
like
and
there
is
no
choice,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out,
as
contrasted
with
other
commercial
speech
cases,
suppose
a
big
company
was
concerned
about
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
using
heat
pumps
and
using
electric
space
heating
rather
than
other
kinds
of
space
heating,
isn't
that
information
equally
inaccessible
except
from
the
company
itself
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
heat
pumps,
of
course,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
competition
for,
say,
a
new
subdivision
is
being
developed
by
a
huge
builder
or
a
new
100-story
office
building,
they
have
a
choice
as
to
what
kind
of
heating,
space
heating
it
shall
employ,
electric,
coal,
and
so
forth.
isn't
that
just
old-fashioned
competition
in
that
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
clearly
is
not
a
monopoly
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
place
they
need
the
advertising
the
most,
is
where
there
is
competition?
they
wouldn't
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
tell
people
about
rates
they
have
to
pay
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't
you
justify
it
on
grounds
of
protecting
other
consumers
rather
than
saving
oil?
