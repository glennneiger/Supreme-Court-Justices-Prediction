mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
a
single
judge
of
that
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
the
secretary
of
labor
from
enforcing
the
civil
penalty
provisions
of
the
child
labor
statute.
specifically,
judge
gasch
found
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated
by
the
last
sentence
of
section
16
(e)
of
the
child
labor
statute,
which
provides
that
the
sums
collected
by
the
secretary
as
civil
penalties
may
be
applied
towards
reimbursement
of
the
cost
of
determining
child
labor
violations.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated.
appellee
runs
a
chain
of
restaurants
in
the
southeastern
united
states.
in
1969,
1973
and
again
in
1974,
department
of
labor
compliance
officers
found
that
appellee
had
employed
a
number
of
busboys
and
waitresses
in
violation
of
the
federal
child
labor
laws.
when
two
more
such
instances
came
to
light
in
march
1975,
the
department
ordered
an
investigation
into
the
hiring
practices
in
all
of
appellee's
restaurants.
thereafter,
the
assistant
regional
administrator
of
the
employment
standards
administration,
which
is
the
part
of
the
department
of
labor
that
enforces
the
child
labor
laws,
cited
appellee
for
169
separate
child
labor
violations
and
assessed
the
civil
penalty
of
$103,000.
this
sum
represented
a
penalty
of
$300
each
for
unlawfully
implying
--
employing
seven
persons
under
the
age
of
14,
plus
a
penalty
of
$100
each
for
unlawfully
employing
162
persons
under
the
age
of
16.
in
addition,
the
assistant
regional
administrator
assessed
the
penalty
of
$500
for
each
of
the
169
children,
or
a
total
of
$84,500,
because
he
believed
that
the
history
of
child
labor
violations
in
appellee's
restaurants
stretching
back
to
1969,
showed
that
appellee
had
been
aware
of
the
child
labor
violations
but
had
done
nothing
to
correct
them.
now,
appellee
filed
an
exception
to
this
citation.
and
after
a
hearing,
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the
existence
of
the
child
labor
violations
was
clearly
established,
but
he
disagreed
with
the
assistant
regional
administrator
on
whether
these
violations
were
willful.
the
administrative
law
judge
therefore
struck
the
$84,500
assessment
and
reduced
the
civil
penalty
to
$18,500.
now,
appellee
did
not
seek
judicial
review
of
this
decision.
instead,
several
months
later,
it
began
these
lawsuits
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
section
16
(e)
is
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
prohibiting
its
enforcement.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
appellee
could,
we
believe,
have
sought
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
assessment
of
the
$18,500
and
raised
this
constitutional
objection
as
well
as
any
other
objections
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
--
it
was
raised
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
raised
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
although
the
administrative
law
judge
could
not
have
given
relief
on
that
ground,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that
precludes
raising
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
on
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
--
well,
that's
--
he
could've
raised
it
earlier,
but
i
think
the
first
time
he
could
have
had
--
it
could
have
had
any
expectation
of
relief
was
in
an
article
iii
court.
that's
--
that's
right.
now,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
district
court
agreed
with
appellee's
contentions,
relying
on
a
line
of
cases
beginning
with
tumey
against
ohio.
judge
gasch
held
that
the
reimbursement
provision
of
section
16
(e),
and
i
quote,
“creates
a
situation
in
which
bias
may
creep
into
the
decisions
of
the
regional
office
--
officials
who
impose
civil
penalties,
that
the
statute
is
therefore
invalid
under
the
due
process
clause.”
now,
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court
is
erroneous
for
three
separate
reasons.
first,
we
submit
that
the
due
process
standards
established
in
cases
such
as
tumey
and
ward
versus
village
of
monroeville,
are
applicable
with
full
force
only
to
officials
exercising
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
functions.
second,
even
assuming
that
those
standards
do
apply
to
the
situation
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
the
court
below
erred
in
concluding
that
the
child
labor
civil
penalty
scheme
creates
a
significant
risk
of
personal
or
institutional
bias.
and
finally,
even
if
the
reimbursement
provision
of
section
16
(e)
does
violate
due
process,
the
court
below
should
have
enjoined
only
the
enforcement
of
that
provision.
it
should've
left
the
remainder
of
the
civil
penalty
statute
enforced.
acceptance
of
any
of
these
three
arguments
would
require
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
our
broadest
contention,
which
is
that
the
principles
recognized
in
cases
such
as
tumey
and
ward
are
inapplicable
here
because
the
assistant
regional
administrator
in
citing
an
employer
for
violation
of
the
child
labor
laws
and
assessing
a
proposed
penalty
is
acting
as
a
plaintiff
for
a
prosecutor
and
not
as
a
judge.
the
basic
notion
that
underlies
tumey
and
ward
is
that
a
litigant
is
entitled
to
have
his
case
adjudicated
by
someone
who
is
free
of
any
substantial
likelihood
of
personal
or
institutional
bias.
the
court
in
those
cases
struck
down
statutory
schemes
that
in
the
court's
words,
“offered
a
possible
temptation
to
the
average
men
as
judge,
to
forget
the
burden
of
proof
required
to
convict
the
defendant,
or
which
might
lead
and
not
to
hold
the
balance
nice,
clear
and
true
between
the
state
and
the
accused.”
now,
we
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
these
principles.
but
they
cannot
be
easily
transferred,
we
think,
to
situations
such
as
this
one
involving
governmental
officials
exercising
prosecutor
of
rather
than
adjudicative
functions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
--
well,
there
is
a
case
in
fact,
because
tumey
against
ohio
and
there
was
another
aspect
of
tumey
which
involved
that
and
was
not
challenged
by
anyone.
in
fact,
this
court
had
language
in
its
opinion
which
i
hope
to
quote
to
the
court
which
said
that
that
would
be
all
right.
i
don't
see
any
due
process
from
there.
it
might
be
an
unwise
piece
of
legislation.
but
i
--
defendants
entitled
as
a
matter
of
due
process
to
a
fair
and
impartial
judge.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
holds
any
decision
of
this
court.
certainly,
that
holds
that
is
a
matter
of
due
process,
he's
entitled
to
a
neutral
and
impartial
prosecutor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
traditional
deference
which
courts
have
given
to
decisions
by
the
executive
branch
of
who
to
prosecute
and
what
to
prosecute
for,
that
there
would
--
there
would
not
be
a
prophylactic
or
pro
se
rule
--
per
se
rule
such
as
the
court
imposed
on
judges
in
cases
like
tumey.
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
an
individual
defendant,
if
he
wanted
to
get
the
charges
against
him
dismissed
to
show
that
his
particular
prosecution
was
somehow
motivated
by
some
improper
or
invidious
reason.
appellees
never
made
that
--
that
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
or
any
personal
property.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
--
one
of
the
unfortunate
aspects
of
this
case
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
explain
why
the
reimbursement
provision
worked
its
way
into
the
statute,
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
reasonable
speculation.
that's
correct.
we're
not
dealing
with
very
large
sums
of
moneys
here
as
i
tend
to
get
to
in
a
moment
in
terms
of
esa,
the
employment
standard
administration's
total
budget.
but
i
think
that
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
part,
it
was
a
desire
by
congress
to
place
some
of
the
costs
of
investigating
and
prosecuting
child
labor
violations
on
the
perpetuators
of
those
violations.
now,
in
our
view,
the
appropriate
standard
of
judicial
review
should
be
different
when
scrutinizing
factors
that
arguably
influence
the
institution,
rather
than
the
adjudication
of
civil
or
criminal
proceedings.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that's
treated
well
to
the
traditional
--
judicial
deference
to
prosecutorial
discretion
in
bringing
cases.
in
fact,
the
court
recognized
this
crucial
distinction
of
the
tumey
case
itself,
because
tumey
involved
an
ohio
liquor
control
ordinance
which
provided
that
the
town
mayor
who
sat
as
a
judge
in
prosecutions
under
the
ordinance,
would
receive
fees
in
addition
to
his
salary,
if
he
convicted
the
defendant,
but
not
if
he
acquitted
the
--
the
defendant.
the
court
found
this
provision
to
be
unconstitutional.
there
is
another
part
of
the
very
same
ordinance
that
was
involved
in
tumey
which
provided
that
50%
of
the
fines
collected
were
to
be
placed
in
a
so-called
secret
service
fund,
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
prohibition
laws
and
the
ordinance
specifically
provided
that
15%
of
any
fine
was
to
go
to
the
deputy
marshals,
10%
of
the
fine
was
to
go
to
the
prosecutor,
and
15%
was
to
go
to
the
town
detectives
as
compensation
for
their
services
in
enforcing
the
liquor
laws.
and
no
one
challenged
of
the
legitimacy
of
these
latter
provisions
of
the
ordinance
in
tumey,
involving
law
enforcement
officers
rather
than
adjudicative
officers.
the
fact
the
court
expressly
stated
at
the
ends
of
--
end
of
its
opinion
that
in
contrast
to
the
situation
with
judges,
the
legislature
and
i
quote,
“may
and
often
ought
to
stimulate
prosecutions
for
crime
by
offering
to
those
who
shall
initiate
and
carry
on
such
prosecutions
rewards
for
thus
acting
and
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
people.”
we
think
this
proposition
should
govern
the
case
here.
now,
appellee's
answer
to
this
argument
is
essentially
to
assert
that
esa
assistant
regional
administrators
function
much
like
judges.
but
there's
simply
nothing
in
the
child
labor
statute
or
the
accompanying
regulations
to
support
that
assertion.
regional
administrators
don't
preside
over
hearings
or
make
findings
of
fact
based
upon
evidence
presented
in
an
adversary
context.
in
issuing
a
notice
of
violation
or
assessing
a
proposed
penalty,
they
act
just
like
in
assistant
united
states
attorney,
in
determining
what
charges
to
bring
or
what
relief
to
seek
as
in
a
civil
complaint.
and
most
importantly,
perhaps,
if
the
employer
disagrees
with
the
assistant
regional
administrator's
determination,
either
of
that,
there
is
a
violation
or
what
the
penalty
should
be.
it
may
seek
review
and
it's
entitled
to
de
novo
review
before
the
administrative
law
judge
who's
unquestionably
neutral.
and
the
administrative
law
judge's
ruling
is
then
subject
to
judicial
review
in
an
article
iii
court.
it's
clear
then
that
an
assistant
regional
administrator
in
imposing
a
civil
--
a
child
labor
violation
and
assessing
a
proposed
penalty,
does
not
act
as
a
judge.
and
that
the
standards
developed
in
tumey
and
ward
for
assuring
the
neutrality
of
judges,
do
not
apply.
our
system
contains
a
number
of
incentives
both
direct
and
indirect,
to
motivate
executive
branch
officials
to
do
their
job
diligently.
and
section
16
(e)
is
one
such
incentive
because
it
stimulates
child
labor
enforcement
which
congress
prior
to
the
1974
amendments
thought
was
an
area
that
had
been
sort
of
neglected
it.
we
submit
that
congress's
efforts
to
achieve
this
beneficial
result,
and
as
i
said,
to
impose
some
of
the
causes
of
ferreting
out
child
labor
violations
on
those
who
perpetrate
the
violations,
it's
not
inconsistent
with
any
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause.
now,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
this
contention
and
holds
that
the
assistant
regional
administrator's
assessment
of
civil
penalties
for
child
labor
violations
is
subject
to
the
due
process
standards
of
tumey
and
ward,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
must
still
be
reversed
because
any
possibility
of
bias
resulting
from
the
reimbursement
provision
is
wholly
insubstantial
and
remote.
this
court
stated
in
tumey
and
indeed
judge
gasch
acknowledged
that
due
process
does
not
prohibit
the
exercise
even
of
judicial
power.
when
the
judicial
officer's
personal
interest
is
so
remote,
trifling
or
insignificant
that
it
may
fairly
be
--
supposed
to
be
incapable
of
affecting
his
judgment.
and
that
describes
the
situation
in
this
case.first,
as
i
said
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
unlike
in
tumey,
here,
no
labor
department
official
stands
to
benefit
even
by
$1
personally
from
any
civil
penalty
assessment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
can,
but
that
is
dependent
upon
a
number
of
other
things
happening
over
which
the
assistant
regional
administrator
has
no
control.
if
this
case
is
in
some
way
similar
to
ward,
i
assume,
because
in
ward,
the
mayor
there
also
had
no
personal
interest
in
the
fines,
but
the
fines
would
go
into
the
town
treasurers
and
the
mayor
was
dependent
upon
the
revenues
in
the
town
treasury.
but
--
but
here
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
that's
right.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
this
portion
of
our
argument
if
it
agrees
with
us
in
our
initial
assertion
which
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
relying
cases
on
cases
like
tumey
and
ward.
but
if
tumey
and
ward
are
applicable,
we
still
think
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
because
the
interest
here
is
so
insignificant
that
it
couldn't
possibly
have
affected
the
decision
making
of
the
assistant
regional
administrator.
unlike
in
ward,
where
the
moneys
went
right
to
the
town
treasury,
here,
all
the
moneys
go
to
esa's
national
office
which
may
or
may
not
decide
to
distribute
the
money
back
to
the
regional
officials.
it
doesn't
have
to.
and
the
statute
is
clear
that
even
when
esa's
national
office
decides
to
distribute
the
moneys
to
the
--
to
the
regional
officials,
it
does
it
on
the
basis
of
costs
actually
incurred
by
the
regional
official
and
not
in
amount
of
penalties
that
are
assessed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
think
we're
talking
of
fairly
large
sum
--
sums
in
comparison
to
esa's
total
budget.
in
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
in
tumey
and
ward,
the
fines
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
in
tumey
and
ward,
the
amounts
that
were
involved
represent
that
almost
half
of
the
town's
budget
is
quite
substantial
and
there
was
direct
evidence
in
each
of
those
cases
that
the
mayor
was
quite
concerned
about
the
possible
loss
of
that
revenue
source.
now,
here
by
contrast,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
sums
collected
as
civil
penalties
represent
less
than
1%
of
esa's
total
budget
and
that
far
from
being
fiscally
dependent
on
these
moneys,
esa
in
each
of
the
year
since
this
reimbursement
provision
was
enacted,
has
turned
back
to
the
treasury
as
unused
funds,
an
amount
far
greater
than
was
even
collected
as
civil
penalties.
so
it's
quite
difficult
to
imagine
how
any
assistant
regional
administrator
would
be
influenced
to
even
the
slightest
extent
by
the
possibility
that
some
of
the
moneys
collected
as
civil
penalties
which
child
labor
violations
might
be
returned
to
his
office
at
some
later
point.
we've
set
forth
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
the
series
of
increasingly
improbable
assumptions
that
the
court
would
have
to
indulge
in,
in
order
to
conclude
that
there's
any
real
possibility
of
prejudice
from
the
reimbursement
scheme.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
that
would
be
a
--
why,
i
don't
know
that
any
such
communication
would
--
would
go
out.
i
think
it
would
be
a
proper
communication
for
the
national
office
to
say
to
the
atlanta
regional
office,
“you
have
uncovered
x
percent
of
--
of
the
total
nation's
child
labor
violation.”
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
communication.
and
i
think
that
these
--
these
regional
offices
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
has
crossed
to
fair
it
out,
child
labor
violations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
because
the
amount
of
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
sure
it
wouldn't
happen,
but
even
if
it
did
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
it
wouldn't
have
the
influence
that
judge
gasch
attributed
to
it.
because
the
amounts
that
the
assistant
regional
administrator's
assess
are
really
irrelevant.
it's
the
amounts
that
are
collected
and
anyone
who
challenges
the
assessment
gets
de
novo
review
before
the
administrative
law
judge
who
can
reduce
the
amount
of
the
penalty
to
zero
or
any
figure
between
zero
and
the
amount
initially
assessed.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
in
--
few
minutes
remaining
to
an
issue
that
the
court
need
not
reach
unless
it
agrees
with
judge
gasch
that
the
reimbursement
provision,
section
16
(e)
renders
the
civil
penalty
statute
unconstitutional.
that's
the
question
of
the
proper
remedy.
district
court
struck
down
the
entire
civil
penalty
statute.
it's
our
position
that
that
remedy
is
overbroad
and
totally
unwarranted.
that
at
most,
the
district
court
should've
severed
the
last
sentence
of
section
16
(e)
providing
for
the
reimbursement
of
civil
penalty
funds
that
are
actually
collected.
question
of
severance,
of
course,
is
essentially
one
of
legislative
intent.
in
this
case,
there's
strong
proof
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
have
a
civil
penalty
statute
without
any
reimbursement
provision
rather
than
have
no
civil
penalty
remedy
for
child
labor
violations
at
all.
first,
the
statute
contains
a
broad
severability
clause.
and
second,
the
legislative
history
of
section
16
(e)
shows
that
congress'
overriding
concern
was
to
provide
the
department
of
labor
with
a
new
tool
to
strengthen
child
labor
enforcement,
because
the
injunctive
and
criminal
provisions
of
the
prior
law
were
found
to
be
totally
ineffective.
this
congressional
objective
would
obviously
be
frustrated
if
the
entire
civil
penalty
statute
were
struck
down.
the
last
and
best
piece
of
evidence
perhaps
that
congress
would
have
wanted
the
reimbursement
provision
severed,
if
it
were
found
unconstitutional,
is
that
in
a
number
of
similar
civil
penalty
statutes,
congress
has
provided
that
the
funds
collected
as
civil
penalty
shall
go
into
the
united
states
treasury.
and
that's
the
result
that
would
occur
here
if
the
last
sentence
of
section
16
(e)
were
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
so,
for
all
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
erred
in
declaring
the
civil
penalty
statute
under
the
child
labor
laws
unconstitutional
and
in
enjoining
its
enforcement.
and
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
just
a
few
short
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i'd
like
to
lie
to
rest
this
notion
that
administrative
law
judges
might
be
entitled
to
reimbursement
under
section
16
(e).
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
to
backup
that
statement.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
never
construed
the
statute
that
way
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
noted,
judge
gasch
rejected
that
argument.
section
16
(e)
allows
reimbursement
only
to
those
officers
that
have
supervised
the
work
of
assessing
and
collecting
civil
penalties.
the
office
in
the
department
of
labor
that
supervises
the
enforcement
of
the
child
labor
laws
is
the
employment
standards
administration.
the
administrative
law
judges
are
not
part
of
the
employment
standards
administration.
moreover,
it
would
raise
problems,
i
think,
not
only
under
the
fifth
amendment,
but
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
construe
the
statutes
so
that
any
moneys
went
to
the
administrative
law
judges.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
sort
of
bizarre
form
of
statutory
construction
to
construe
a
statute
so
as
to
make
it
unconstitutional.
now,
as
to
this
notion
that
the
secretary
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
get
set
salaries
set
by
law,
can't
be
varied.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
but
they
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
they
do
just
--
and
once
they
hit
the
ceiling,
they
may
not
be
able
to
get
any
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me.
article
iii
judges,
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
maybe
up
in
this
court
soon.
the
sec
--
the
secretary
or
the
assistant
regional
administrator
cannot
put
the
money
in
his
pocket.
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
the
sums
collected
must
be
applied
towards
reimbursement
of
the
costs
of
determining
child
labor
violations.
and
finally,
as
to
appellee's
point
that
de
novo
review
is
not
available
before
the
administrative
law
judge
solely
on
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
penalty,
this
very
case
shows
that
that's
false
because
appellee
never
challenged
the
violations
in
this
case,
conceded
that
it
had
violated
the
child
labor
laws
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
the
administrative
law
judge
still
reduced
the
penalty
from
$103,000
to
$18,500.
thank
you
very
much.
