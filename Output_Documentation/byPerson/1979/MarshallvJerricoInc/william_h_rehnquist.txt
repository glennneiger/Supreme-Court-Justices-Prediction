mr.
--
mr.
power,
don't
--
don't
you
concede
that
there's
a
good
deal
of
attenuation
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
--
don't
you
concede
that
there's
a
good
deal
of
attenuation
here
between
what
in
fact
happens
and
what
might
be
a
genuinely
undesirable
and
perhaps
unconstitutional
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
admittedly,
it's
unique,
but
a
--
an
entire
series
of
steps
would
have
to
occur
before
the
actual
bias
could
be
reached,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
each
administrative
law
judge
assigned
to
the
labor
department
has
a
line
item
appropriation
for
his
salary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
power,
are
you
suggesting
that

that
$39,000,
the
regional
administrator
in
atlanta
could
simply
decide
to
put
it
in
his
own
private
bank
account?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
--
the
secretary
of
labor
could
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
so
the
regional
administrator
in
atlanta.
you
have
collected
so
many
fines
this
year
that
i'm
going
to
give
all
of
them
to
you.
