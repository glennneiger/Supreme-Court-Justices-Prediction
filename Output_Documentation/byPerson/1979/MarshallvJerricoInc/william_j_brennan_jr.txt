jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
provision
of
9
(a),
i
guess
it's
9
(a),
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
you
--
but
which
is
it
that
covers
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
says,
“for
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
agency
and
or
to
secure
the
special
services
of
persons
who
are
neither
officers
nor
employees
of
the
united
states.”
but
i
don't
see
--
what
is
the
language
that
covers
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'll
read
in
16
(e),
“sums
collected
shall
be
applied
toward
reimbursement
of
the
cost
of
determining
in
violations
--
violations
in
assessing,
collecting
such
penalties.”
that's
not
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
29
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
the
administrative
law
judge
says
within
that
language
“bureau,
service,
office,
division
or
other
agencies.”
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
must
be
saying
mr.
power
that
this
authorizes
something
in
the
way
of
a
--
of
a
bonus
to
the
administrative
law
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
suggest
the
secretary
has
ever
given
at
that
interpretation,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
just
suggesting
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that
might
happen
under
this
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
you
suggest
he
could
put
it
in
his
own
pocket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
