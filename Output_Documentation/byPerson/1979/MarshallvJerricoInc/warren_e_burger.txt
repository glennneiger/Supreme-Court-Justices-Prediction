we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
79-253,
marshall,
the
secretary
of
labor
against
jerrico,
incorporated.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
raise
that
on
a
--
at
an
earlier
stage
in
--
within
the
framework
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
having
raised
it
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
first
time,
he
could've
raised,
it
would've
been
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
review
in
an
article
iii
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case,
could
any
individual
anywhere
in
the
chain
of
command
in
the
labor
departments
have
profited
personally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
--
this
apparently,
is
a
means
of
--
of
getting
some
funds
without
having
them
appropriated
by
congress
directly.
is
that
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
the
particular
individuals
aren't
going
to
get
more
money
because
they
levy
more
funds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they'll
get
a
raise
--
you
mean
they'll
get
a
raise
in
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
secretary
exercising
this
discretion
could
provide
that
annually,
he
would
give
awards
of
$1000
each
to
every
administrative
law
judge
that
sustained
a
fine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
could.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wait
a
minute.
an
administrative
law
judge
has
an
appropriation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
administrative
law
judge
doesn't
have
an
appropriation
anymore
than
a
law
clerk
that
this
court
has.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
have
a
150
administrative
law
judges,
there's
a
lump
sum
in
the
budget
which
is
a
line
item
compensation,
but
no
administrative
law
judge
has
any
budget
or
any
part
of
any
budget
allocated
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
than
any
other
branch
of
the
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
the
same
--
is
this
the
same
pattern
of
assessing
fines
as
under
the
mine
safety
act,
if
--
if
you
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
the
secretary
of
labor
could
take
all
the
furniture
out
of
his
office
and
take
it
home
and
--
and
try
to
keep
it,
but
he
might
run
into
some
other
problems
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
power.
mr.
geller,
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
