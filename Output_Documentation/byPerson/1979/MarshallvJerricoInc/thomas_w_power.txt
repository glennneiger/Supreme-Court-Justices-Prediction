mr.
thomas
w.
power
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
differences
with
the
arguments
of
the
solicitor
general
can
be
summarized
in,
i
believe,
four
very
brief
statements.
first,
the
most
significant
issue
here
in
our
judgment,
is
not
actual
bias,
but
rather
and
far
more
importantly,
the
potential
for
bias
and
the
appearance
of
bias.
it
does
not
matter
how
much
money
was
actually
collected
or
how
much
money
was
distributed
to
a
given
regional
office.
the
potential
is
here
for
these
moneys
to
be
used
to
increase
salaries
and
to
substantially
increase
the
appropriation
of
the
various
offices
involved.
secondly,
the
administrator
and
his
assistant
acting
under
section
16
(e),
are
judges
under
the
clear
statutory
language
under
section
16
(e)
and
they
cannot
be
likened
to
prosecutors.
third,
potential
for
bias
and
actual
bias
under
section
16
(e)
is
very
substantial
and
not
remote.
and
finally,
severance
of
the
reimbursement
provisions
will
not
cure
the
potential
for
bias
or
the
appearance
of
bias.i've
made
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i'm
sorry
justice,
i
dont
think
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
in
fact
actually
happened
was
an
unconstitutional
situation
and
in
fact,
you
had
actual
bias
in
this
particular
case.
but
nevertheless,
i
see
the
potential
as
the
far
greater
evil
in
here
in
this
particular
section
16
(e)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
is
entirely
unique
in
any
civil
money
penalty
section
now
in
united
states,
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
in
the
country.
i
cannot
find
anything
anywhere
near
a
life
is
in
--
in
any
statute.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
the
statute
provides
for
example,
your
honor,
that
the
fund
shall
be
used
to
reimburse
the
assessor
of
the
fines.
and
those
funds
go
directly
to
the
salary
and
expense
budget
of
the
various
offices
involved.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
think
that
that's
entirely
possible,
if
not
likely.
if
you
read
the
statutory
language,
that
is
precisely
what
is
provided.i
think
that's
discretionary
with
the
secretary
of
labor.and
maybe
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
think
that's
entirely
possible.
i
think
it's
discretionary
to
the
secretary
of
labor
to
give
them
that
money,
but
why
not?
the
act
provides
that
they
get
the
money
and
that
it
shall
be
used
in
the
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
reimburse
them
for
the
ordinary
expenses.
it
further
provides
that
the
funds
maybe
used
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
law
to
hire
individuals
as
cited
in
united
states
government,
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
--
of
this
act.
so
i
think
moreover,
the
funds
can
be
quite
substantial
as
related
to
an
individual
office
of
--
of
the
assessor.
and
frankly,
i
see
no
prohibition
in
the
statutory
language
from
the
funds
going
directly
to
the
so-called
administrative
law
judge.
that
is
in
the
office
of
the
department
of
labor.
and
although
it's
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
that
we're
entitled
to
a
fair
and
impartial
judgment
at
that
level,
we
do
not
see
it
because
we
think
that
the
alj
or
the
administrative
law
judge,
rightly
under
the
statute,
not
only
could
have,
but
the
secretary
of
labor
was
required
and
mandated
under
the
statute
to
reimburse
the
administrative
law
judge
for
his
expenses
as
well.
now,
i
don't
think
they
ever
got
around
to
it,
because
we
raised
the
issue
right
at
the
outset
at
the
administrative
level
and
i
guess
this
was
really
the
first
case
that
came
up
on
the
civil
money
penalties.
this
was
adopted
in
1974
and
regulations
were
issued
more
like
1975
and
this
was
the
first
case
that
really
become
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
and
he
never
really
did
any
works
that
would
gain
him
a
share
of
the
split
on
the
moneys
that
had
been
raised
earlier.
but
the
statute
provides
that
he
shall
receive
the
funds
that
he
got.
he's
responsible
for
determining
the
funds,
he's
part
of
the
process
and
he
should
have
got
a
proportionate
share.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
pardon,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
did
you
say
could
or
he
would?
mr.
thomas
w.
power
could.
i
--
because
--
yes,
i
think
he
clearly
could.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
to
prevent
him
and
the
statutory
language
says,
“notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
law.”
so
unless
there's
some
subsequent
law
that
would
prohibit
that
kind
of
action
from,
i
don't
see
why
not
and
i
believe
he'd
violate
the
constitution.
but
i
think
even
the
potential
for
that
violates
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
would
say
that
by
virtue
of
section
6
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that
the
--
the
secretary
of
labor
could
be
fined.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
justice
marshall
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
it
--
it
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
although
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
sufficient
to
hold
that
he
couldn't
do
it,
if
he
was
going
to
be
subject
to
a
fine.
but
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
w.
power
oh,
he
could
be
fired.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
said,
fine
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes,
he
could
but
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
political
consideration.
he
could
be
--
he
could
be
fired
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
would
do
it,
but
in
this
country
we
have
had
men
in
position
that
could
take
that
kind
of
action.
it
could
be
a
very
lucrative
rewarding
proposition.
several
millions
of
dollars
could
be
raised.
in
the
instant
case,
the
--
the
respondent,
the
appellee
had
some
8000
minors
in
his
employer
over
a
period
of
two
years
and
they
found
169
to
be
in
violation
and
assessed
a
fine
of
$103,000.
now,
you
could
multiply
that
into
the
billions
in
--
in
united
states.
so
the
potential
is
there.
we
believe
that
the
greatest
issue
of
16
(e)
mandates
that
kind
of
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes,
justice.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
think
both
in
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
the
administrative
law
judge?
mr.
thomas
w.
power
the
--
the
section
16
(e)
of
which
9
(a)
is
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
--
a
part.
and
it
provides
that
the
funds
shall
be
used
to
be
--
to
reimburse.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
the
language
that
says
that
the
money
shall
be
credited
to
the
appropriation
of
the
office,
let
me
see,
this
one
of
(inaudible).
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no,
justice,
i
--
i'm
referring
to
the
--
the
language
that
says
on
this
--
under
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
--
29
u.s.
9
(a),
“all
moneys
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
--
here
and
after
received
by
the
department
of
labor
in
payment
of
the
cost
of
such
work
and
this
would
be
the
work
of
collecting
the
--
determining
and
assessing
the
fines
shall,
not
may,
shall
be
deposited
to
the
credit
of
the
appropriation
of
that
bureau,
service,
office
division
or
the
agency
of
the
department
of
labor.”
of
course,
the
administrative
law
judge
is
an
office
of
the
department
of
labor,
which
supervise
such
work.
and
then
it
goes
on
further
and
says,
“maybe
used
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
for
the
ordinary
expenses
of
such
agency.”
and
as
judge
gasch
found,
those
expenses
including
salary
and
include
the
other
overhead
items.
the
ordinary
expenses
of
such
agency
or
to
secure
the
special
services
of
persons
who
are
neither
officers
nor
employees
of
the
united
states,
so
the
secretary
of
labor
could
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
he
would
increase
--
he
would
be
reimbursed
--
he
would
be
reimbursed
from
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
again,
he
--
his
salary
and
the
amount
of
work
or
the
expenses
of
his
office
are
definitely
restricted
by
the
budgets
under
which
he
operates
both
as
recommended
by
the
president
and
as
approved
by
congress.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
now,
he
could
substantially
increase
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
am
not
certain
with
that,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
when
you
--
when
you
get
it
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
i
think
he
expands
his
overall
operation.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
it
gets
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
he
gets
an
increased
appropriation,
if
you
will.
let's
assume
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
i
am
suggesting
that
it's
entirely
potential
with
a
knowing
what
is
section
16
(e),
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
if
he
went
into
the
treasury,
i
would
not
dispute.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that's
only
a
potential.
maybe
they
will
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
but
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes.
it
permits
a
bonus.
in
other
words,
it
permits
the
--
let's
assume
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
am
suggesting
very
definite
of
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
mandated
that
his
income
or
at
least
his
budget
authorization
is
increased
for
that
year
and
it
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know
how
the
secretary
of
labor
would
handle
it
or
--
but
in
the
discretion,
i
think
that's
entirely
permissible,
because
it
says
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
but
i
am
--
but
i
am
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
--
i
--
again,
with
the
language,
this
is
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
on
discretion
of
the
secretary,
can
use
it
for
--
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses,
i
think
perhaps
he
could.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well,
again,
that's
a
--
that's
a
political
consideration,
but
i
don't
know
whether
he'd
be
in
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
i
think
--
i
think
congress
has
a
bill
pending
right
now
to
change
the
proposition.
but
i
don't
think
congress
really
intended
it
at
all.
i
think
it
--
it
--
because
of
the
way
the
language
was
drafted,
congress
never
realized
what
the
impact
was.
i
know
myself
i
was
working
on
the
legislation
at
the
time
and
i
had
no
idea
of
the
significance
of
it.
it
comes
from
a
very
unique
provision
in
the
law
where
they
--
the
department
of
labor
has
a
--
a
division
that
gathers
statistics
called
the
bureau
of
employment
or
statistics
i
believe
and
labor
statistics.
and
under
that
--
under
that
provision
of
the
law,
it
is
permissible
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
have
outside
sources
fund
statistical
research
work.
in
other
words,
while
they're
conducting
one
survey,
they
might
pick
up
certain
amount
of
money
from
a
company
to
gather
additional
information
that
they're
more
efficient
at
gathering
and
can
do
more
economically.
and
in
the
process,
they
add
to
their
appropriation.
but
in
this
instance,
as
for
example
with
respect
to
administrative
law
judge,
let's
assume
that
administrative
law
judge
has
an
appropriation
of
one
million
dollars.
if
he
spends
enough
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
the
office
of
the
administrative
law
judge.
well
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i'm
sorry.
he
has
--
he
has
a
budget
within
the
department
of
labor
though.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
he
has
a
line
item.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
think
that
judge
gasch
was
responding
to
a
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
well
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
again,
i
--
i
agree
with
you
although
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary
for
judge
gasch
in
that
proceeding
to
consider
that
question.
he
reached
--
he
reached
his
decision
based
on
the
potential
for
bias
at
the
lower
level.
and
he
reached
it
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that
--
that
is
correct.
and
the
argument
has
been
made
that
he
--
that
--
that
it's
clear
that
he
did
--
that
he
is
not
potential
for
bias
and
i
do
not
believe
that
issue
was
addressed
by
the
solicitor
general
so
that
is
conceded
and
i
do
not
agree
that
it
was
conceded
at
the
lower
level.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
not
for
his
individual
salary.
i
believe
it's
to
the
entire
office.
i
believe
the
salaries
are
--
are
set.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
that
--
that,
i
understand.
again,
on
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
actual
right
to
appeal
to
administrative
law
judge,
the
argument
being
made
that
a
--
a
--
the
administrator
or
the
assistant
regional
administrator
can
be
likened
to
a
prosecutor
rather
than
--
than
to
a
judge.
we
disagree
with
this
contention.
first,
the
argument
is
made
that
we're
entitled
to
de
novo
review
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
we
do
not
believe
the
statutory
language
permits
the
administrative
law
judge
to
give
us
a
--
a
judicial
review
or
de
novo
review.
the
language
of
the
statute
permits
a
party
who
is
--
has
been
assessed
to
fine
--
an
employer
assessed
to
fine
with
the
right
to
a
hearing
only
under
very
limited
conditions,
expressly
limited
to
an
objection
by
the
employer
to
the
determination
that
the
violations
actually
occurred.
so
for
example,
if
an
employer
was
charged
with
169
violations
of
the
child
labor
laws
and
in
fact
those
violations
occurred,
he
could
not
obtain
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
penalty.
and
this
--
that
is
the
clear
and
unequivocal
reading
of
the
language.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
--
as
was
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
department
of
labor
in
this
particular
case
before
judge
gasch,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
was
made
in
other
cases
by
--
by
the
department
of
labor.
and
there
is
one
specific
administrative
law
judge
that
did
in
fact,
hold
that
in
light
of
the
fact
of
the
employer
only
objected
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
penalties
assessed,
rather
than
the
fact
that
the
violations
actually
occurred,
that
he
could
not
give
him
an
administrative
hearing.
and
consequently,
we
--
we
assert
that
we
--
that
the
administrative
--
the
administrator
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
assistant
administrator
is
in
fact
a
judge
and
under
section
16
(e)
and
not
can
--
not
be
likened
to
a
prosecutor.
also,
i'd
like
to
make
the
point
that
in
the
instance
of
--
unlike
a
prosecutor
in
this
instance,
the
assistant
regional
administrator
sets
the
penalties.
he
has
the
discretion
and
the
mandate
on
the
congress
to
determine
what
--
how
much
of
this
$1000
fine
should
be
set.
the
prosecutor
doesn't
set
the
penalty.
the
prosecutor
moreover,
doesn't
get
to
keep
the
penalty.
the
penalty
goes
to
the
treasury
of
united
states.
it
doesn't
go
back
to
the
office
to
reimburse
the
prosecutor
for
his
expenses.
again,
as
we
see
no
reason
why
the
prosecutor
--
the
prosecutor
(inaudible)
could
get
the
increase
of
salary.
i
also
like
to
make
the
point
that
--
that
in
--
in
truth
in
fact,
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
assistant
regional
administrator
who
assesses
these
fines,
who
raise
the
first
charge
in
the
first
instance.
it
really
is
the
employment
standards
administration
of
washington
d.c.
they
approve
all
of
these
individual
fines.
they
negotiate
or
approve
individual
settlements
and
they
get
the
benefits
of
the
penalties
that
are
actually
assessed.
the
argument
was
made
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no.
i
--
i
know
not,
your
honor,
because
on
--
for
example,
the
osha
act
with
which
i
am
familiar,
the
--
the
fines
assessed
go
directly
to
the
treasury
of
united
states.
this
is
the
only
area
where
the
fines
go
back
to
the
assessor
or
the
fines
to
reimburse
him
for
his
cost
of
assessment.
so
this
is
unique.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
civil
money
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
if
it's
an
antipollution,
i
don't
--
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
went
back
to
the
assessor
of
the
fines.
i
believe
that
act
provides
that
the
fine
--
and
i
question
the
constitutionality
of
--
myself,
but
i
think
this
is
far
more
serious
in
this
case.
those
--
those
fines
i
believe
were
used
to
--
to
provide
a
fund
to
clean
up
waters.but
they
didn't
go
back
to
reimburse
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
--
the
assessor
of
the
fines.
that's
about
the
closest
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
see.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
question
the
constitutionality
even
of
that
provision.
oh,
i
think
this
is
far
more
serious,
because
i
think
assessor
of
fines
in
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
probably
highly
motivated
for
assuring
adequate
funds
to
clean
waters
and
i
think
he
could
be
readily
biased
by
--
by
his
desire
to
increase
the
coffers
to
clean
waters
and
i
think
that's
properly
a
function
of
congress.
but
nevertheless,
the
fines
in
that
instance
do
not
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
party
assessing
the
fines.
the
argument
was
made
that
--
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
potential
for
bias
and
actual
bias
is
not
substantial
and
it's
too
remote.
we
believe
that
this
argument
cannot
be
properly
made.
the
reimbursement
of
the
actual
cost
including
salaries
and
expenses
go
directly
to
the
assessor,
to
the
administrator,
to
the
assistant
regional
administrator.
and
i
emphasize
that
this
was
the
finding
of
judge
gasch
in
his
opinion.
whether
the
fines
were
in
fact
used
to
increase
salaries
or
not,
they
can
be
used
under
the
clear
statutory
language.
in
the
instant
case,
$39,200
went
to
the
atlanta
office.
that
was
two
and
a
half
times,
what
any
other
office
got
from
fines
collected
that
year.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
no,
i
am
not,
justice
rehnquist.
i
--
i
think
that
he
would
not
have
the
discretion,
but
i
do
think
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
that
kind
of
discretion
under
the
act.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
could
use
the
money.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
--
it
--
it
appears
to
me,
unless
--
since
the
act
has
such
broad
language
and
says
notwithstanding
any
other
provisional
law
that
he
has
this
kind
of
discretion.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
the
secretary
of
labor
could
--
mr.
thomas
w.
power
--
put
it
in
his
own
pocket?
mr.
thomas
w.
power
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
permissible
either
directly
or
indirectly,
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
power
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
in
violation.
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
relay
any
enumeration
to
himself,
to
reimbursement
for
the
cost
of
doing
work
in
connection
with
child
labor
enforcement.
but,
i
think
the
--
the
more
significant
thing
is
for
example
in
the
atlanta
regional
office,
if
--
is
the
question
--
is
the
administrator
or
the
assistant
regional
administrator
potential
--
is
or
potential
bias
here.
and
if
the
man
has
a
budget
--
let's
assume
of
a
$100,000
a
year,
to
operate
his
office
to
employ
his
secretaries
for
travel
and
expense
budget,
and
he
can
increase
that
budget
by
really
slapping
at
two
employers
in
--
by
way
of
civil
money
penalty
fines
and
increase
that
budget
from
$100,000
a
year
to
operate
it
and
get
to
$200,000,
then
i
think
he's
got
real
potential
for
bias,
without
even
looking
into
the
question
whether
or
not
he
can
increase
his
salary.
finally,
the
--
the
question
of
severance,
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
in
my
remaining
couple
of
minutes.
actual
--
if
--
if
you
were
to
sever
--
if
this
court
were
to
sever
the
reimbursement
provision
of
section
16
(e)
alone,
we
do
not
believe
we
would
cure
the
potential
for
bias
or
appearance
for
bias.
because
severance
of
an
unconstitutional
section
of
or
the
language
of
16
(e)
would
not,
in
fact,
give
actual
notice
to
investigators
of
the
department
of
labor
or
to
assistant
regional
administrators
or
to
administrators
or
for
that
matter
of
administrator
law
judges
or
employers,
the
language
would
still
read
as
it
--
as
it
presently
reads
that
the
moneys
shall
be
used
to
reimburse
the
assessor
of
the
fine.
also,
severance
who
ignores
the
fact
that
all
regulations
currently
adopted
and
schedule
of
fines
and
instructions
to
assistants
at
the
department
of
labor
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
fines,
are
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
home
office,
the
washington
office,
will
get
its
share.
so
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
even
the
--
that
we'd
be
back
here
in
the
supreme
court,
if
you
severed
the
--
the
reimbursement
provision
because
we
would
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
regular
--
regulations
themselves
because
they
were
based
on
assumption
that
the
department
of
labor
was
going
to
get
its
share
of
the
funds.
and
that
they
did
not
need
the
responsibility
to
set
fines
on
the
basis
of
the
gravity
of
the
offenses
instructed
by
congress.
and
finally,
we
do
not
believe
that
severance
would
accomplish
congressional
intent.
congress
directed
these
moneys
should
be
use
to
reimburse
the
department
of
labor
and
be
used
for
child
enforcement
purposes.
if
a
speculation
is
going
to
be
made
that
they'd
be
just
as
satisfied
to
have
the
moneys
go
into
the
treasury
of
united
states,
we
question
that.
we
think
they
might
well
have
not
intended
that
the
existing
child
labor
regulations
be
enforced.
they
might
well
have
intended
that
these
funds
be
used
to
revise
what
we
consider
to
be
an
unequated
and
--
and
grossly
inadequate
set
of
child
labor
laws
which
are
the
primary
responsibility
in
our
judgment
for
the
teenage
and
minor
unemployment
we
have
in
united
states
today.
and
it's
our
feeling
that
those
--
that
congress
as
is
actually
the
case,
there
is
a
bill
pending
in
congress
right
now
that
--
that
would
not
only
require
that
the
civil
money
penalty
is
set
and
go
to
the
treasury
of
united
states,
but
in
--
in
addition
to
and
as
part
of
the
same
piece
of
legislation,
would
require
the
secretary
of
labor
to
completely
review
existing
child
labor
regulations
so
as
to
assure
justice
in
--
in
enforcement
of
this
particular
statute
by
having
a
--
a
logical
and
reasonable
set
of
child
labor
regulations.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
