mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
railroad
today
has
asked
this
court
to
consider
two
issues.
the
first
is
to
impose
a
net
wage
standard
as
the
measure
of
damages
in
all
fela
claims.
this
proposition
has
never
been
followed
by
any
state
or
federal
appellate
court
decision
in
this
country.
the
second
issue
asks
this
court
to
today
reverse
a
jury
award
in
this
case,
as
a
cautionary
instruction
telling
the
jury
that
this
award
was
tax-free
was
not
given
by
the
trial
judge.
again,
no
state
or
federal
appellate
court
has
ever
reversed
a
verdict
for
the
failure
to
give
such
a
cautionary
instruction.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
feel
the
judge
could
not
have
answered
that
question,
as
there
was
no
evidence
before
this
jury
as
to
the
effects
of
taxes
on
the
man's
gross
earnings.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
the
instruction
that
was
offered
was
not
the
instruction
that
your
honor
has
just
presented
to
me.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
there
was
an
effort,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
admit
a
cautionary
instruction,
stating
that
the
award
was
not
subject
to
taxes.
that,
in
itself,
was
the
only
cautionary
instruction
that
was
tendered
before
the
trial
judge,
and
that
was
properly
refused.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was
done
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
by
an
offer
of
proof
in
chambers,
so
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
to
this
jury
where
they
would
possibly
raise
that
question.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
that's
correct,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
that
case;
since
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
as
to
the
effect
of
gross
versus
net,
there
could
be
no
instruction.
as
we
all
are
aware,
instructions
are
based
on
evidence
that
is
presented
before
the
jury
in
open
court.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
would
have
been
an
improper
cautionary
instruction.
also,
there
are
only
four
decisions
--
if
i
may
explain,
justice
white.
the
petitioner
railroad
cites
four
cases
in
the
united
states,
state
and
appellate,
discussing
the
possibility
of
a
proper
cautionary
tax-free
award
instruction.
tenore
is
a
state
decision
out
of
new
jersey.
in
tenore
the
cautionary
instruction
was
given,
therefore
it
is
not
applicable.
new
jersey
is
a
minority
state.
the
second
case
they
cite
is
dempsey.
in
dempsey,
the
cautionary
instruction
was
given,
was
tendered.
it
was
refused,
under
missouri
state
law.
on
appeal,
the
missouri
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
not
reversible
error
to
not
give
the
cautionary,
but
possibly
it
should
be
given.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
this
is
point
two,
but
--
you
have
jumped
me
to
point
two
and
i
am
going
to
point
two.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
computing
the
award,
if
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no.
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
a
proper
instruction,
just
as
i
do
not
feel
the
other
is,
depending
on
the
evidence
that
is
presented
to
the
jury
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
this
instant
case,
no,
your
honor,
because
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
improper
offer
of
proof
by
the
railroad
counsel
was
that
the
taxes
were
so
negligible
that
under
the
mcweeney
minority
rule
they
would
not
have
any
substantial
or
significant
impact
on
the
man's
gross
earnings.
the
taxes
were
based
on
from
the
years
1973
to
the
year
2000,
or
a
total
of
27
years,
the
taxes
would
be
$
54,000,
approximately
only
$2,000
a
year
in
taxes.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
my
complaint,
your
honor,
was
based
on
the
law
in
illinois,
the
instruction
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief
as
to
the
evidence
of
damages
for
wrongful
debt
in
illinois.
contrary
to
what
mr.
trienens
stated,
you
are
not
limited
merely
to
your
wages,
under
illinois
law,
for
a
wrongful
death
action
under
the
fela,
or
in
any
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
you
cannot
recover
pain
and
suffering.
however,
in
the
case
of
minor
children,
of
which
decedent
had
four,
the
youngest
being
approximately
four
months
of
age,
the
illinois
instruction
allows
you
to
recover
damages
for
the
loss
of
care,
attention,
instruction,
training,
advice
and
guidance
to
each
of
those
children.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
that
is
the
law
in
illinois.
that
is
the
illinois
pattern
instruction.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
matter,
under
federal
law,
for
damages
in
the
fela,
you
are
entitled
to
the
same
basic
elements
that
i
just
stated
to
your
honor.
that
is
undisputed.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
if
you
are
asking
for
a
specific
case
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
--
from
this
court,
i
can
only
refer
back
to
the
history
of
the
fela
from
this
court,
as
to
the
liberal
recovery,
as
to
the
full
and
proper
intent
for
complete
damages
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
i
do
not
dispute,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
you
say.
i
can
only
assert
to
the
court
that
the
proper
element
of
damages
under
an
fela
is
not
strictly
limited
to
wage
laws.
it
never
has
been
in
any
federal
court
decision.
it
never
has
been
by
any
federal
district
court,
by
any
court
of
appeals,
or
by
this
court.
in
the
petition,
the
railroad
has
asserted
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
courts,
as
to
the
method
of
computing
future
loss
of
earnings
in
an
fela
claim.
it
implies,
as
mr.
treinens
said
today,
that
this
is
conflict
of
gross
versus
net.
that
is
simply
not
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
the
instruction,
your
honor,
is
a
cautionary
instruction.
it
is
procedural.
it
is
discretionary
with
a
trial
court.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
instruction
that
has
ever
been
tendered
that
has
been
reversed
by
way
of
a
cautionary
instruction.
the
boxberger
case,
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
familiar
with,
coming
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
allowed
a
cautionary
instruction
to
be
given,
which
stated
complete
language.
the
language
in
boxberger
was
that
the
jury
was
told
that
the
award
was
not
taxable,
and
that
therefore
the
jury
should
neither
add
to
nor
subtract
from
the
award,
because
of
this
consequence.
that
instruction
is
totally
different
from
the
instruction
tendered
in
the
lepelt
case.
the
liepelt
instruction
as
tendered
by
the
railroad
merely
asked
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
award
was
not
subject
to
taxes.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
regard
to
cautionary,
your
honor,
or
in
regard
to
modified
gross
wages?
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
cautionary
instruction
mandated
by
this
court,
in
regard
to
instructing
a
jury
on
the
taxability
of
an
award.
i
think
it
is
procedural.
i
think
it
is
discretionary.
i
think
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
individual
trial
judges,
as
all
cautionary
instructions
are.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
if
this
court
feels
that
a
cautionary
instruction,
under
the
fela,
should
be
given,
then
the
boxberger
instruction
would
be
a
proper
instruction,
as
was
the
domeracki
instruction
stating
the
same
thing.
but
it
must
be
a
complete,
whole
instruction.
it
must
not
be
a
part
instruction.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
as
to
a
cautionary
instruction,
and
that
has
been
the
law
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
your
honor,
that
is
an
entirely
different
issue.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
cautionary
instruction,
as
has
always
been
--
and
there
is
no
federal
appellate
court
decision
changing
that
--
has
always
left
cautionary
instructions
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
for
good
reason.
if,
in
fact,
this
court
feels
that
a
cautionary
instruction
should
be
given,
then
it
should
be
a
complete
cautionary
instruction,
as
that
given
in
boxberger
or
domeracki,
advising
both
sides
of
the
coin
to
the
jury,
that
the
award
should
neither
be
increased
nor
decreased
because
of
taxes.
that
was
not
the
instruction
given
in
liepelt.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
true.
and
if,
in
fact,
this
court
feels
there
should
be
a
cautionary,
it
should
be
prospective
only,
because
no
case
has
ever
been
reversed,
state
or
federal,
where
that
type
of
cautionary
instruction
was
not
tendered.
it
should
have
prospective
effect
only.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
the
doctrine
in
law
as
to
cautionary
instructions,
justice
rehnquist,
have
always
been
interpreted
as
being
discretionary
with
the
trial
court.
it
is
a
caution
to
a
jury
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
the
judge
was
hampered,
or
did
not
properly
present
the
law,
since
there
are
no
federal
or
appellate
courts
that
have
ever
reversed
the
failure
to
give
this
type
of
cautionary
instruction.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
is
the
question
-
if
you
reverse
it,
is
that
proper?
are
you
asking
me?
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
i
am
merely
saying
that
cautionary
instructions
regarding
the
question
of
taxation
have
never
in
this
country,
ever
been
reversed
for
the
failure
to
give.
they
have
been
made
prospective,
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
court
feels
that
this
is
an
improper
cautionary
instruction
that
it
should
be
made
prospective
and
follow
the
language
in
boxberger
or
in
domeracki.
that,
of
course,
is
the
court's
discretion.
however,
that
should
have
prospective
application.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
that
the
court
or
the
jury
assumed
that
the
award
was
or
was
not
taxable.
we
are
giving
a
cautionary
instruction,
going
into
the
state
of
mind
of
jurors.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
two
respects.
the
appendix
and
our
brief
show
that
there
were
co-plaintiffs
in
this
matter,
that
the
plaintiff
lepelt
received
the
verdict
of
$775,000.
liepelt
was
the
fireman
on
this
operating
crew.
a
co-plaintiff
whose
name
is
in
the
record
received
a
verdict
--
by
the
name
of
maynard
--
of
$16,500.
he
was
the
brakeman.
that
man,
in
the
evidence
of
the
case,
was
permanently
injured
and
unable
to
ever
return
to
railroad
work
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
so,
for
counsel
to
come
here
today
and
assert
to
the
court
what
he
feels
the
jury
did
in
a
runaway
verdict,
certainly
would
have
no
application.
because
here
is
a
co-plaintiff,
represented
by
different
counsel
than
myself,
who
received
a
substantially
lower
verdict
than
was
asked
for
by
the
jury.
in
addition
to
that,
mr.
justice
stevens
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
your
honor,
i
can
merely
reiterate
that
lost
wages
is
only
one
element
of
damages
under
the
construction
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
clearly,
your
honor.
clearly.
four
minor
children,
ranging
in
ages
from
four
months
to
age
16,
leaving
a
wife
and
these
four
children.
i
presented
days
of
testimony
of
superior
employers
of
this
man
from
the
railroad.
i
presented
testimony
of
co-employees,
of
neighbors
and
friends,
as
to
this
man's
characteristics,
this
man's
ability,
this
man's
worth
to
his
family,
under
the
applicable
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury.
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
trial
counsel
that
that
verdict
was
substantiated
by
the
evidence
of
these
witnesses.
this
case
was
tried
primarily
on
damages,
your
honor,
not
on
liability.
liability
wasn't
the
major
issue
in
this
case.
there
are
five
federal
circuits
that
follow
a
gross
wage
rule.
there
are
not
twenty
states,
your
honors,
there
are
thirty-five
states
that
follow
a
straight
gross
wage
rule.
those
states
are
listed
in
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
those
thirty-five
state
bar
associations.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
number.
if
we
are
talking
about
gross
wages,
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
in
all
types
of
litigation
gross
should
be
used,
modified
gross
should
be
used,
or
net
should
be
used.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
your
honor,
kelly
was
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1916.
and
what
kelly
merely
stated
was
that
all
lump
sum
awards,
under
the
fela,
were
to
be
discounted
to
a
present
cash
value.
our
gross
wages
were,
in
fact,
discounted
to
a
present
cash
value.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
feel
that
kelly
is
certainly
not
appropriate
in
this
matter.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
that
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
logic,
your
honor,
revolves
around
the
fact
that,
as
we
know
the
law
today
in
the
vast
majority
of
federal
and
state
jurisdictions,
gross
wages
is
the
proper
and
fair
measure
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
several,
your
honor.
the
first
and
most
prominent
would
be
that
of
the
double
tax
being
imposed
upon
the
injured
or
deceased
party.
the
award,
if
it
is
to
be
reduced,
as
your
honor
suggests,
by
estimated
future
taxes,
brings
it
down
then
to
a
net
award.
that
net
award
will
be
subject
to
taxes
on
the
interest
on
the
award
that
the
injured
party
will
receive.
so,
in
effect,
we
are
twice
taxing
the
injured
party.
it
is
double
taxation.
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
well,
then
in
effect
the
court
is
suggesting
that
you
include
the
speculative
nature,
the
conjecture
of
taxes,
the
prolonging
of
trial
by
taxes,
come
down
to
a
net
award,
then
refuse
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
interest
on
the
award
is
taxable,
taxable
as
unearned
income,
as
opposed
to
earned
income,
can
be
taxable
as
high
as
a
70%
tax
bracket,
depending
on
the
interest
on
the
award
for
the
individual.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
evidence
that
is
presented
at
a
trial
is
in
order
to
get
a
proper
award
you
must
in
fact
reduce
that
to
a
present
cash
value,
then
you
must
invest
that
money
at
a
reasonable
return,
so
at
the
end
of
the
work
expectancy
of
the
decedent
there
is
nothing
left.
otherwise,
it
is
an
unjust
enrichment
to
the
injured
party.
it
must
be
invested
and
at
the
end
of
the
investment
period,
in
this
case
twenty-seven
years,
the
testimony
of
the
economist
is
there
is
zero
left.
that's
why
it
is
not
an
excessive
award.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
exactly
the
issue,
and
that
has
been
cited
by
cases
repeatedly,
that
the
candle
is
not
worth
the
light,
the
effort.
they
do
cancel
each
other
out.
that's
why
gross
wages
has
been
the
standard
of
damages
in
the
great
majority
of
federal
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
with
the
exception
if
we
follow
the
minority
gross
wages
rule,
as
enunciated
in
mcweeney,
and
the
fourth
circuit
said
follow
mcweeney.
because
we
then
come
into
a
situation
where
our
wages
are
--
or
taxes
on
the
wages
--
are
so
insignificant
we
have
done
nothing
but
prolong
the
jury
trial,
we
have
increased
cost
to
each
side,
we
have
gone
into
conflicts
and
complicated
calculations
to,
as
your
honor
says,
merely
end
up
approximately
the
same.
the
current
law,
as
we
have
it
now
from
the
federal
courts,
is
yes
there
is
division,
five
circuits.
the
first,
third,
fourth,
fifth
and
eight
follow
gross
wages
only.
the
remaining
five
follow
mcweeney.
there
is
no
circuit
that
has
ever
followed
a
net
wage
loss.
there
is
no
case
reported
in
the
country
that
has
ever
said
that
net
wages
are
the
measure
of
damages
in
all
fela
cases.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
not
even
the
middle,
your
honor.
to
cite
mcweeney
verbatim,
"income
tax
matters
should
not
be
taken
into
consideration
unless
and
until
a
decedent's
earnings
are
beyond
the
lower
or
middle
range
of
the
income
scale."
obviously,
in
a
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
when
it
gets
there,
then
the
jury
has
the
right
to
hear
the
type
of
impact,
or
the
dollar
amount
that
these
taxes
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
exactly,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
certainly,
when
they
exceed
the
mcweeney
threshold
level.
the
reason
being
that
if
you
are
in
the
lower
or
middle
range
the
taxes
will
be
insignificant.
here
the
taxes
on
this
man
for
twenty-seven
years
were
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
it
does
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
are
contending
that
the
earnings
and
the
taxes
--
here
is
the
railroad
laborer
who
would
always
be
at
the
lower
end
of
a
wage
scale.
at
the
time
he
was
killed
in
'73,
he
was
earning
right
under
$12,000
a
year.
in
the
year
2000,
he
would
earn
only
approximately
$40,000.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes.
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
mcweeney
are
all
cases
in
which
income
has
been
far
more
substantial,
from
years
back.
the
leroy
case,
where
they
talked
about
$16,000,
was
a
decade
ago.
we
are
talking
about
a
wage
earner
who
earned
in
'73,
twelve
years
later,
substantially
less.
so
that
it
has
no
effect.
it
has
no
bearing.
mcweeney,
in
fact,
would
allow
--
even
if
mcweeney
was
followed,
it
would
allow
federal
courts
throughout
the
country
to
set
out
what
is
substantial
by
way
of
wages,
and
what
is
significant
by
way
of
taxes.
it
would
lead
to
a
total
hodgepodge
for
individual
judges
around
the
country,
to
say
that,
for
instance,
$20,000
in
a
city
like
washington
could
be
considered
not
substantial
because
of
the
cost
of
living
here.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
your
honor,
i
can
only
reiterate
that
the
$300,000
is
more
than
guidance.
it
is
care,
attention,
instruction,
training
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
before
this
court
regarding
the
excessiveness
of
the
verdict.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
just
like
court
costs,
witness
expenses,
attorneys'
fees,
are
extraneous
issues
and
matters
that
are
not
considered
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
taxes?
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
your
honor,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
taxes,
where
they
are
not
significant,
do
not
have
any
emphasis
or
bearing
on
an
award
in
regard
to
loss
of
wages.
the
other
elements
of
damages
have
not
been
raised
in
this
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
excessive.
it
is
almost
an
impossible
situation
for
me,
in
a
limited
period
of
time,
to
express
to
the
court
the
witnesses
who
testified
as
to
the
type
of
care,
training,
guidance,
advice,
instruction,
that
this
man
gave
to
four
children
in
raising
them.
and
to
sit
here
now
as
a
reviewing
court
and
ask
whether
or
not
that
is
a
hodgepodge,
or
that
is
excessive,
without
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
i
used
it
merely
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
modified
wages,
under
mcweeney,
that
if
we
abolish
the
five
circuits
who
followed
the
gross
wages,
and
have
only
modified,
we
will
have
different
decisions
throughout
as
to
what
is
reasonable
or
what
is
substantial
by
way
of
taxes.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
and
that
also
invades
the
province
of
a
jury,
your
honor.
they
can
only
listen
to
the
evidence
that
is
presented
on
that
issue,
then
deliberate
as
to
that
amount.
that
amount
should
not
be
in
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
wages
should
be
gross
wages,
modified
gross
wages,
or
net
wages.
we
claim
that
gross
and
modified
gross
--
we
fall
under
either
category
because
they
were
not
significant
and
the
taxes
were
not
substantial.
in
conclusion,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
her
husband,
the
decedent,
at
a
time
of
his
tragic
death,
was
a
railroad
laborer
at
the
low
end
of
the
wage
and
tax
scale
in
the
united
states
in
1973.
therefore,
the
effects
of
future
taxes
on
future
wages
would
have
been
nominal
under,
again,
majority
gross
wages
or
minority
modified
gross
wages.
also,
there
has
never
been
a
cautionary
instruction
that
has
ever
reversed
on
this
issue.
and,
therefore,
the
failure
to
give
such
a
cautionary
instruction
would
not
constitute
reversible
error.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
if
i
may
answer
a
question
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
that
is
a
half
measure,
your
honor.
the
award
is
not
taxable.
finish
the
instruction,
mr.
justice
white,
"therefore,
neither
add
nor
subtract
to
your
verdict."
that
was
not
the
cautionary
that
was
given
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
object
to
a
full
cautionary
instruction.
the
award
should
neither
be
added
to
nor
subtracted
from
on
account
of
taxes.
an
instruction
must
be
a
fair
and
proper
instruction
to
both
sides.
this
was
a
half
instruction
in
lepelt.
no
instruction
that
was
given
on
that
basis
has
ever
been
sustained
by
any
federal
court
in
this
country.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
this
case,
that
would
become
prospective
law.
the
cautionary
instruction
should
not,
and
never
has
been,
grounds
for
reversible
error.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
that
judgment
was
reversed,
your
honor,
because
in
boxberger
they
followed
gross
wages,
and
boxberger
followed
mcweeney
and
reversed
to
go
to
modified
gross
wages.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
in
future
cases,
the
footnote
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
again,
your
honor,
the
boxberger
opinion
is
some
twenty
pages
long.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
it
reversed
the
judgment
specifically,
because
gross
wages
were
not
used
as
a
measure
of
damages
and
they
followed
mcweeney.
it
was
a
secondary
issue
which
was
ruled
prospectively,
that
from
that
time
on
--
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
certainly.
mr.
richard
s.
fleisher
well,
again,
my
reading
of
boxberger
is
that
it
was
reversed
for
the
failure
to
allow
gross
wages,
that
in
regard
to
the
cautionary
instruction
neither
add
nor
subtract,
that
was
given
and
affirmed
and
given
prospective
application
to
that
case
forward
or
any
others
in
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
