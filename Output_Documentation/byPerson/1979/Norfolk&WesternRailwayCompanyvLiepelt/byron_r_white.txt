justice
byron
r.

putting
it
just
a
little
differently,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
what
you
are
saying
is
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
it
is
relevant
and
a
state
rule
that
says
it
is
irrelevant
is
preempted
by
the
federal
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
the
akron
case
and
all
the
cases,
ohio
can't
apply
its
rule
as
to
releases.
texas
can't
apply
a
procedural
rule,
we
are
pretty
far
down
the
federal
law
track
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
doing
that
when
you
estimate
wages
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
rather
strange
to
hear
you
talk
--
why
it
is
that
your
suggested
rule
is
in
such
a
decided
minority
around
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
illinois
has
been
--
a
lot
of
the
states
have
--
this
is
an
old
issue
in
negligence
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
state
courts
of
last
resort
agree
with
you
on
both
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
three
or
four?
two
or
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
disagree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
should
have
been
settled
your
way,
you
say?
it
was
settled
one
way
or
the
other,
for
heaven's
sake.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
want
the
instruction
on
the
award,
to
keep
the
jury
from
thinking
that
it
is
subject
to
taxation
and
doubling
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
his
income
that
much
couldn't
have
been
a
tax
mistake.
you
said
14%
is
what
you
wanted;
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
jury
thought
the
award
would
be
taxable?
and
it
will
be
taxable
at
more
than
50%?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
amount
of
the
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
amount
requested
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
jury
is
going
to
think
about
taxes
in
connection
with
the
award,
why
wouldn't
they
think
about
taxes
in
connection
with
measuring
damages,
without
an
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
knew
what
his
wages
were
supposed
to
be.
i
guess
each
one
of
them
is
paying
some
taxes.
they
might
talk
about
how
much
he
was
really
going
to
take
home,
how
much
was
really
going
to
be
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
would
think
you
would
--
if
the
jury
is
going
to
think
about
taxes
in
one
context,
it
would
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
before
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
you
are
not
making
any
point
of
the
distinction
between
the
amount
requested
and
the
amount
of
the
verdict,
under
illinois
practice?
i
find
nothing
in
the
appendix
which
indicates
an
amendment
to
the
pleading.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
follows
from
that,
i
take
it,
that
you
would
submit
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
to
the
jury,
"don't
consider
the
matter
of
taxation
in
computing
the
award"?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you?
i
take
it
you
--
if
no
evidence,
the
jury
might
think
about
taxes.
you
don't
want
them
to
think
about
taxes.
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
what
if
the
judge
had
instructed
the
jury
here
on
his
own,
would
that
have
been
error?
on
his
own,
"do
not
take
taxes
into
consideration,"
would
that
have
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sorry,
but
i
was
asking
about
in
computing
the
award
would
you
be
entitled
to
instruction,
"do
not
consider
taxes"?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
opponent
says
he
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
to
the
jury
to
consider
the
impact
of
taxes,
and
reduce
the
award,
just
consider
take-home
pay.
and
i
want
to
know
whether
you
think
you
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
to
the
jury,
"do
not
consider
taxes
at
all
when
computing
the
award"?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
it
gets
there,
what
happens,
in
a
mcweeney
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
when
it
reaches
that
level,
then
they
are
entitled
to
calculate
what
the
net
--
the
take-home
pay
after
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
are
some
jurisdictions
that
on
certain
facts
calculate
net
earnings.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
doesn't
sound
like
very
supportive
of
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
five
circuits
say
that
whenever
it
is
worth
talking
about,
"why,
of
course,
we
calculate
net
earnings."
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
a
practicality
argument
more
than
a
principle.
on
principle,
these
five
circuits,
following
the
mcweeney
rule,
if
it
were
worth
the
candle,
as
you
say,
they
would
calculate
net
wages
in
every
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
why
you
--
have
you
said
all
you
want
to
say
about
the
refusal
--
about
the
cautionary
instruction
on
the
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
nutshell,
why
is
that
so
damaging
to
plaintiff's
case,
to
have
the
jury
told
that
your
award
--
the
award
is
not
taxable?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
object
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume,
though,
that
we
agreed
with
you
--
suppose
we
thought
that
the
federal
law
required
that
sort
of
an
instruction,
a
complete
instruction.
what
would
we
do
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
come
out
under
mcweeney?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
if
someone
had
made
an
assignment
of
25%
of
his
wages
in
advance
to
some
creditor?
and
the
employer
had
been
notified
and
he
just
sent
him
a
check
every
month,
that
employer
did.
would
you
be
claiming
that
the
damage
--
certainly
his
survivors
couldn't
benefit
from
that
25%.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
answer
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
the
assignee
then
would
be
one
of
the
plaintiffs
for
that
25%.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
united
states
ought
to
join
in
this
suit
if
you
win.
they
are
losing
their
tax.
