mr.
howard
j.
trienens
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
here.
in
both
respects,
the
illinois
courts
have
a
rigid,
unwaivering
rule
which
forbids
a
jury
being
informed
of
two
federal
tax
consequences,
income
tax
consequences,
that
profoundly
affect
the
amount
of
awards
in
fela
cases.
one
of
them
is
whether
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
a
decedent
would
have
paid
on
his
income
may
be
considered
in
deciding
how
much
the
beneficiary
--
how
much
contribution
the
beneficiary
has
lost.
and
the
second
is
to
inform
this
jury
of
the
tax-free
character
of
the
award,
however
measured.
now,
the
point
of
fela
is
not
to
punish
rareties.
it
is
to
be
sure
that
beneficiaries
get
damages
measured
by
their
financial
loss,
and
for
that
only.
the
fela
cases
can
be
tried
in
state
or
federal
courts,
but
the
proper
measure
of
damages,
to
quote
from
an
early
decision
in
chesapeake
&
ohio
v.
kelly,
"proper
measure
of
damages
is
inseparably
connected
to
the
right
of
action,
and
therefore
must
be
settled
according
to
uniform
standards
under
the
fela."
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
to
that
issue
on
the
instruction,
the
answer
is
we
would
not
be
here
for
failure
to
give
the
instruction.
it
might
well
have
been
that
the
state
court
would
have
granted
a
remittitur
in
this
case,
but
no,
we
wouldn't
have
been
here
if
the
instruction
had
been
given
on
that
aspect.
the
other
aspect
is
income
tax
effect
on
the
amount
of
contribution.
that's
a
separate
question.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
that
issue,
but
we
would
still
be
here
on
the
issue
we
briefed
first,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
in
measuring
the
damages
actually
incurred
by
the
beneficiaries
they
should
have
reflected
the
fact
that
the
amount
the
decedent
paid
in
taxes
would
never
have
been
available
to
the
beneficiary.
and
that's
a
quite
different
question.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir,
but
perhaps
the
reason
i
fell
off
the
sled
was
this.
it
is
more
than
the
instruction
on
this
question
of
the
taxation
of
the
decedent
and
how
much
would
have
been
available
for
contribution,
because
that
was
a
question
of
no
evidence,
no
cross-examination,
a
lot
of
other
things.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
thank
you.
if
cross-examination
had
been
permitted
in
this
case
on
the
matter
of
federal
income
tax
effects,
if
the
offer
of
proof
had
been
received
in
evidence,
and
the
jury
had
been
properly
instructed,
we
think
the
award
would
have
been
very,
very
different.
the
errors
here
were
clearly
prejudicial.
the
lower
court
never
found
--
they
weren't
prejudicial,
they
just
found
that
they
weren't
errors.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
in
the
first
place,
in
a
death
case,
like
this,
it
is
clear
that
the
losses
are
limited
to
financial
losses
incurred
by
the
beneficiaries
by
reason
of
the
death.
that's
not
involved
here,
but
it
certainly
is
not
true
that
a
factor
such
as
federal
income
tax,
which
is
after
all
money
that
could
never
have
gotten
to
these
beneficiaries
if
the
man
had
lived
--
but
that's
not
something
to
be
considered.
it
is
no
more
trivial
than
the
other
things
that
go
on.
in
fact,
it
is
far
more
important
than
the
other
things
that
go
on
in
the
trials
of
these
cases.
for
example,
the
expert
witness
gets
on,
for
the
plaintiff.
he
goes
through
what
you
would
regard
as
just
a
rigamaroll,
but
in
fact
he
very
precisely
says,
"here
are
the
gross
wages,
$13,000
when
he
died,
$17,000
by
the
time
of
trial,
so
many
percent
a
year
to
reflect
inflation"
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
tried
to
and
were
blocked
from
doing
it.
in
fact,
plaintiff
counsel
came
and
said,
"judge,
these
people
may
ask
him
questions
like
that.
we
want
you
to
instruct
these
lawyers
before
the
witness
ever
gets
on
he
can't
talk
about
that."
we
had
an
argument
before
the
witness
went
on,
we
had
an
argument
afterward,
about
our
right
to
cross-examine
on
this
question.
as
far
as
adding
to
the
complexity
here,
if
this
expert
witness
who,
as
i
say,
came
on
with
the
wages
projected,
then
he
discounted
those
wages
--
excuse
me,
not
discounted
--
he
deducted
from
those
wages
the
personal
expenditures
of
the
decedent,
clothing,
food,
entertainment,
10%
this
year,
25%
later,
50%
later,
31%,
calculates
all
that.
he
says,
"oh,
and
what
would
he
have
contributed
in
terms
of
household
chores,
9%?"
calculates
that.
one
more
sentence
of
that
testimony
--
he
could
have
said,
"of
course,
he
would
have
to
pay
income
taxes,
about
14%."
one
more
sentence,
that's
the
complexity
this
would
have
added
to
that
calculation.
they
say
the
jury
can
run
rampant.
i
don't
think
they
can.
i
don't
think
that
the
problem
here
is
--
all
the
courts
who
dealt
with
this
have
said
it
is
a
question
of
balance.
certainly
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
deal
with
matters
that
are
clearly
relevant
under
the
standards
of
the
act.
why
have
any
standards
under
the
act,
if
that's
the
approach?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
illinois
law
prohibits
it.
it
is
our
position
that
in
cases
where
it
is
substantial,
at
least,
the
state
should
not
prohibit
us
from
asking
the
plaintiff's
witness
did
he
consider
taxes.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
federal
law
should
require
that
subject
matter
be
relevant
to
these
cases,
because
federal
law
is
that
the
measure
is
the
financial
loss
to
the
beneficiaries.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
boxberger
rule.
i
think
judge
ely's
opinion
is
one
of
the
best
on
the
books
on
this
subject.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
he
said
in
every
case
where
it
is
substantial,
and
it
is
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
illinois
rule
absolutely
prohibits
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
that's
what
we
are
here
talking.
but
as
to
the
question
--
and
this
gets
complicated
by
the
question
of
prejudicial
error.
i
am
not
here
saying
that
the
result
reached
by
the
second
circuit
in
mcweeney,
for
example,
was
wrong.
after
all,
the
trial
had
happened,
they
knew
what
the
judgment
was,
they
knew
what
the
evidence
was,
and
it
clearly
was
within
the
range
of
the
evidence,
and
that
this
was
a
fairly
de
minimis
factor,
at
a
man
earning
$4800
a
year
at
that
time.
the
second
circuit
later,
using
the
mcweeney
approach,
came
along
in
a
case
about
subpoena,
where
the
man
had
$16
to
$20,000,
whatever
it
was,
$16
to
$40
--
$25,000
in
that
case,
that
was
substantial,
and
they
should
have
considered
it.
i
am
not
here
saying
that
every
case
in
which
a
trial
judge
doesn't
receive
the
evidence,
and
in
which
appellate
court
says,
"that's
all
right,
but
it
wasn't
prejudicial
in
that
case."
i
am
not
saying
that
you
have
to
knock
out
every
case.
i
am
just
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
that
it
is
relevant.
the
rule
should
be
that
if
we
want
to
cross-examine
on
a
relevant
matter,
just
like
personal
expenditures,
household
chores,
you
ought
to
ask
about
this.
and
if
it
doesn't
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
precisely.
and
the
whole
point
of
the
fela,
both
as
to
defenses
and
as
to
damages
was
to
supplant
state
law.
"it
was
in
order
to
create
uniformity
throughout
the
union"
--
i
am
reading
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
fela.
and,
of
course,
it
supplants
state
law.
when
there
is
a
relevant
matter
that
is
relevant
under
fela,
it
supplants
state
law,
and
state
law
is
knocked
down
when
it
says
that
this
matter
cannot
be
considered
by
the
jury.
it's
wrong.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
sure.
now
take
this
complexity
argument
and
forget
about
taxes.
talk
about
how
far
you
are
down
the
track
and
go
back
to
chesepeake
and
ohio
v.
kelly.
the
state
court
of
kentucky
says,
"here
is
an
fela
case.
it
is
too
complicated
for
juries
to
discount
the
future
earnings
to
a
present
cash
value.
that's
too
complicated
for
juries.
we
in
kentucky
aren't
going
to
require
that."
this
court
said
it
may
be
complicated
but
the
federal
standard
is
it
is
the
contribution
they
lost
and
you
are
overcompensating
them
if
you
don't
discount
the
future
to
present
value.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
would
say
either
of
those.
either
the
discounting
process
or
fixing
the
screen
door
are
far
more
speculative
and
far
more
complex
than
the
question
of
-
does
a
fellow
who
at
this
wage
level
pays
14%
of
his
wages
in
income
taxes.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
sure.
for
example,
in
addition
to
asking
to
cross
on
this
and
being
denied
we
offered
to
prove
through
an
expert
that
over
the
lifetime
$57,000
of
decedent's
gross
income
would
have
gone
to
taxes,
and
therefore
would
never
have
been
available
to
his
beneficiaries.
it's
at
page
75
of
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
world
is
full
of
estimates,
but
as
estimates
go
and
as
you
read
this
case
that's
one
of
the
least
of
the
problems
of
estimating,
one
of
the
least
of
the
problems.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
is
far
more
complicated
than
that.
if
you
really
want
to
prolong
one
of
these
trials
and
really
get
complicated,
you
go
into
that.
now
in
the
first
place,
does
that
represent
today's
interest
rate
or
the
interest
rate
you
are
projecting
over
each
of
the
twenty
years
of
his
life?
does
it
reflect
a
taxable
return
on
equity
or
corporate
bonds?
is
it
influenced
by
municipal
bonds,
as
kelly
suggested
it
should
be?
if
the
latter,
there
is
none
of
this
tax
on
tax
problem.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
but
you
are
also
projecting
the
rate
of
inflation.
plaintiff
put
on
a
witness
to
tell
what
the
rate
of
inflation
would
be
over
the
next
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
exactly
my
point.
in
estimating
his
future
wages,
they
estimate
not
only
the
future
inflation
rate
but
the
future
rate
of
rate
of
increase
in
real
wages
which
railroad
employees
had
incurred.
in
other
words,
beyond
the
inflation.
and
that's
all
relevant,
and
talks
about
practicalities.
the
trial,
as
i
say,
would
have
lasted
another
five
minutes
longer
if
they
had
simply
had
an
income
tax
effect.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
know
that
it
is
such
a
decided
minority.
i
must
say
that
the
law,
as
laid
out
in
these
cases,
is
in
amazing
disarray.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
it
is
the
responsibility
of
this
court,
under
fela,
to
have
a
uniform
standard
for
the
union
to
decide
what
is
right,
what's
the
relevant
standard,
and
that
will
be
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
a
very
old
issue
and
the
courts
are
here
and
there,
throughout
the
country,
on
various
sides,
but
illinois,
i
must
say,
is
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
spectrum
on
both
aspects
of
this
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
let's
see,
new
jersey,
iowa
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
three
or
four
or
five,
yes.
some
of
them
on
one
issue
and
not
the
other.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
flatly?
maybe
twenty,
something
like
that.
of
course,
the
reason
for
this
is
that
there
has
been
an
evolution
here.
what
are
we
doing
in
the
1980s,
almost,
worrying
about
something
like
this,
when
it
should
have
been
settled
back
in
1908?
well,
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
federal
tax
when
the
fela
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
federal
taxes
had
been
a
significant
item
at
the
time
of
the
vreeland
case,
the
kelly
case,
all
the
cases
that
decided
the
standards
of
the
fela
--
if
that
had
been
a
substantial
item,
or
even
thought
about,
there
is
no
doubt
on
the
logic
it
would
have
come
out
the
same.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no.
we
are
talking
only
about
fela
cases
which
have
a
federal
standard.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
get
that
far
because
there
is
an
inherent,
internal
inconsistency
in
the
instructions
that
are
given
under
the
illinois
pattern,
and
generally,
in
fela
cases.
the
inconsistency
is
this.
you
are,
in
the
first
place,
telling
the
jury
to
make
these
beneficiaries
whole,
make
them
whole
as
if
the
man
hadn't
died,
so
his
contributions
would
have
continued.
fine.
but
that
to
a
juror
who
isn't
told
about
the
tax
laws
and
who
is
living
in
a
tax-conscious
society
where,
as
one
of
the
courts
said,
irish
lottery
winnings
are
taxed,
everything
is
taxed
--
when
they
get
that
they
say,
"well,
if
i
am
going
to
make
him
whole
and
evidence
shows
financial
loss
of
$300,000,
i
had
better
see
that
they
get
$600,000."
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
different,
quite
different.
it
is
different
because
in
alyeska
and
elsewhere
the
american
system,
and
under
fela
cases,
is
that
the
defendant
does
not
pay
the
attorney
fees.
congress
could
change
that,
but
they
didn't.
and
to
give
an
instruction
like
that
would
just
"backdoor"
the
attorney
fees
question.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to
pay
taxes.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
separate
question
of
the
award,
however
measured.
whatever
that
measurement
is,
they
don't
pay
any
taxes
on
that.
it
is
just
a
question
of
telling
the
jury
the
facts
of
life.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
the
fact
of
life
also
is
that
congress
has
not
provided
that
the
railroad
should
pay
their
lawyers'
fees
and
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
they
are
of
quite
different
character
than
this.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
exactly,
and
doing
just
what
we
think
they
did
here.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
they
are
so
separate,
and
as
to
the
inherent
logic
of
fela
damages,
no
doubt
the
first
point
which
we
brief
is
the
one
that
fits
right
in
with
that.
as
to
this
instruction
point,
i
think
it
is
important,
and
just
to
paraphrase
judge
ely,
he
says,
"the
benefits
of
informing
the
jury
of
the
true
tax
consequences
are
so
clear,
and
the
burden
so
minimal,
that
the
balance
is
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
giving
instruction."
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
how
could
they
do
us
in?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right,
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law
we
urge
that
there
ought
to
be
a
remittiitur
here.
we
thought
it
was
clear
what
happened,
but
the
illinois
court
said,
"well,
we
are
not
going
to
mess
around
with
these
damages,
with
these
income
tax
instructions."
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
sir.
the
evidence
of
the
economic
witness
who
put
on
the
calculation
of
financial
loss
was
$302,000.
there
was
also
some
talk
about
the
loss
of
guidance
to
the
children.
this
is
loss
of
what
you
would
have
to
pay
somebody
to
give
them
guidance,
as
to
which
the
economic
man
couldn't
put
any
dollar
figure.
so
they
come
in
not
with
$300,000,
to
remotely
resemble
this
guidance,
they
come
up
with
$775,000.
more
than
double.
plenty
of
room
for
all
the
guidance
talk
and
then
doubled
it.
you
see,
that's
the
difference
between
this
and
mcweeney.
if
we
had
come
in
here
and
said,
"all
right,
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
theory
and
just
good
practice"
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
would
have
been
something
in
that
range,
yes,
sir.
no,
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
quite
separate
question
now
of
the
failure
to
give
the
instruction
that
the
award,
however
measured
--
you
see,
the
14%
goes
into
--
however
measured,
you
don't
have
to
pay
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
when
you
throw
in
something
for
guidance
and
double
it,
i
think
that's
the
best
explanation
you
can
of
the
award
of
this
level.
and,
as
i
say,
it
is
unlike
mcweeney
where
they
said,
"well,
judge
weinfeld
didn't
give
the
instruction."
but,
after
all,
the
clear
damages
evidence
showed
about
$120,000.
the
jury
gave
$85,000.
so
how
can
we
say
prejudice?
here
we've
got
the
case
where
the
prejudice
is
clear
from
the
absence
of
the
instruction.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
$775,000.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
$500,000.
and
i
think
before
the
jury,
mr.
fleisher
said
he
would
like
$1
million.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
of
course,
they
couldn't.
there
wasn't
any
record,
because
we
were
blocked
from
that,
too.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
why
not
tell
them?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
why
have
records?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
he
testified
as
to
take-home
pay
in
the
sense
that
he
deducted
the
personal
expenditures
of
the
decedent.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
before
taxes,
so
it
is
something
you
can't
logically
defend,
doing
both
those
things.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
all
cases
--
talking
about
these
fela
cases
--
of
all
cases
in
which
the
railroad
is
saying,
"you
ought
to
let
the
jury
have
these
facts
and
do
the
right
thing,"
and
the
plaintiffs
are
saying,
"you
ought
to
keep
these
things
from
the
jury,"
you
would
think
in
fela
cases
where
the
faith
in
juries
is
supposed
to
be
the
greatest,
this
would
be
one
of
the
ironies
of
all
time.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
my,
yes.
as
to
the
point
about
how
much
of
his
income
would
have
gone
to
the
government
instead
of
his
beneficiaries,
it
would
have
been
much
greater.
but,
of
course,
we
are
in
area
where
it
is
clearly
substantial
under
all
the
cases.
and
also
as
to
the
amount
of
the
award,
$775,000,
or
what
they
thought
they
had
to
double,
that's
pretty
big
money
itself.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
am
not
making
that
point
here
because
the
sole
point
i
am
making
is
the
effect
of
income
taxes
on
the
fela
standards.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
just
one
item,
catch
22.
of
course,
you
can't
seek
an
instruction
on
a
matter
as
to
which
there
is
no
evidence.
i
am
talking
now
about
the
matter
of
the
take-home
pay
of
the
decedent,
where
we
weren't
allowed
to
show
what
his
tax
burden
was.
and
we
weren't
allowed
to
show
it
not
because
--
i
don't
know
what
all
this
chatter
was
about
discretion
and
trial
judge
--
the
reason
this
trial
judge
didn't
do
it
is
the
illinois
courts
won't
let
you
talk
about
taxes
at
all,
balanced,
half
way,
part
way,
all
the
way,
at
all.
and
that's
wrong.
it
is
contrary
to
the
standards
of
fela.
now,
we
asked
about
the
cautionary
instructions.
we
asked
to
talk
to
this
witness
about
the
taxes
the
man
would
have
paid.
we
asked
to
put
in
evidence.
the
judge
says
--
and
i
cite
a74
and
75,
and
again
back
to
a62,
the
judge
says
the
illinois
courts
won't
let
us
talk
about
that.
and
it
was
decided
on
that
basis.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
on
mcweeney
and
boxberger,
which
i
think
accepts
it,
we
would
say
that
whatever
the
situation
was
with
a
man
who
earned
$4800
a
year,
and
after
a
trial
it
was
regarded
as
really
de
minimus
and
not
worth
it
--
in
boxberger
the
man,
a
fireman
in
the
70s
earning
from
$18,000
to
$40,000
projected,
our
man
$17,000
at
time
of
trial
to
$50,000
projected,
exactly
the
same.
and
in
the
second
circuit,
which
follows
mcweeney,
after
all,
in
the
sabena
case,
it
was
$15,000
to
$25,000
projected.
so
we
say
the
mcweeney
rule
fits
this
like
a
glove
in
this
case.
it
would
require
that
this
kind
of
evidence
be
received,
and
if
it
isn't
received
require
that
the
judgment
be
reversed,
which
is
what
we
ask.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right,
and
that's
the
way
these
folks
tried
the
case,
exactly
on
that
method.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
my
answer
is
that
if
the
wife
and
the
children
weren't
getting
any
of
the
money,
if
they
lost
no
contribution,
or
they
lost
contribution
that
was
measured
by
a
smaller
than
you
might
expect
proportion
of
his
wages,
that's
the
contribution
they
lost.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
for
the
fact
that
congress
in
putting
in
the
fela
act
for
people
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
no,
they
are
not,
because
one
of
the
ideas
of
a
windfall
to
railroads
has
that
concept
which
is
wrong,
because
the
railroad
still
has
to
run
the
trains.
it
still
has
to
hire
a
fireman,
and
the
fireman
is
paying
taxes.
in
addition
to
that,
we
then
have
to
pay
this
award,
which
all
we
say
ought
to
be
properly
measured,
to
do
just
what
congress
said,
which
is
to
compensate
these
people
for
the
loss.
now,
the
one
other
item
which
complicates
this,
or
the
parties
try
to
complicate
it,
is
this
double
tax,
tax
on
the
tax,
tax
on
interest
idea.
that
is
a
totally,
totally
separate
concept,
and
would
arise
if
the
decedent
had
had
no
taxable
income,
no
income
subject
to
tax.
and
that's
because
it
relates
to
the
use
of
the
award.
it
goes
to
the
whole
concept
of
single
sum
damages.
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
if
it
goes
to
children
and
their
tax
bracket
is
such
they
don't
pay
it.
and
it
goes,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
to
on
what
basis
do
these
folks
calculate
the
discount
rate?
what
they
love
to
do
is
use
a
low
rate
because
that
produces
a
high
award.
they
use
a
low
rate
and
they
mix
in
some
municipal
bond
interest,
which
if
you
actually
invest
in
that
way
wouldn't
be
taxable.
but
now
they
want
it
both
ways.
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
this
tax
on
tax,
and
what
you
do
with
the
award
after
you
get
it
and
what
you
want
to
assume
about
it,
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
question
we
brought
before
this
court.
it
would
arise
in
any
case.
it
is
a
totally
separate
issue,
as
judge
friendly
recognized
in
mcweeney,
because
he
never
said
it
was
a
totally
offset.
otherwise,
he
said,
if
a
fellow
earns
enough
you
ought
to
consider
his
taxes.
that's
all
we
are
saying.
in
this
day
and
age,
people
earn
enough,
it
is
substantial,
and
you
ought
to
consider
it,
under
traditional
rules
of
the
fela
damages.
thank
you,
sir.
