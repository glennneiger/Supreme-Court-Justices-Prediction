justice
potter
stewart
mr.
trienens,
you've
made
the
point
that
an
fela
case
can
be
brought
in
either
federal
or
state
court,
but
that
federal
law
controls.
is
it
your
basic
submission
here
--
and
the
further
point
that
illinois
forbids
the
introduction
of
any
evidence
in
either
aspect
of
your
federal
income
tax.
first,
that
his
wages
would
have
been
subject
to
federal
income
tax,
and
secondly
that
the
award
is
not
subject
to
any
tax.
is
it
your
submission
that
federal
law
requires
that
this
be
submitted
to
the
jury
or
simply
permits
it?
justice
potter
stewart
illinois
law
prohibits
it.
justice
potter
stewart
federal
law
should
permit
it
or
because
federal
law
requires
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
didn't
say
federal
law
requires
it
in
every
case,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
if
it
is
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
it
is
not
required,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that
could,
at
best,
be
an
estimate.
nobody
knows
what
the
future
tax
laws
are
going
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
in
discounting
the
present
value
--
to
get
the
present
value
of
future
earnings
you
use
more
or
less
an
arbitrary
interest
rate
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
back
in
the
early
1950s
we
used
to
use
4%
assumed
interest
rate,
and
how
wrong
we
would
have
been
--
we
were.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
boxberger
case?
that
judgment
was
reversed.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
the
question
my
brother
white
has
just
asked
you,
it
was
reversed
also
on
that
issue.
and
judge
ely
for
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
final
footnote,
specified
the
precise
instruction
that
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case.
well,
in
future
cases,
that
footnote
said,
but
that
judgment
was
reversed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
reversed
the
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
dont'
you
think
in
that
very
case
the
jury
--
the
district
court
was
instructed
to
tell
the
jury
in
assessing
damages
in
that
very
case
it
was
to
use
that
instruction?
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
future
cases,
in
that
very
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
judgment
was
reversed,
so
you
are
a
little
bit
misleading
when
you
say
no
judgment
has
ever
been
reversed.
