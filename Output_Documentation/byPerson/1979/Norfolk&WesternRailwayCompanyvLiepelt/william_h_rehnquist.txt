justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trienens,
does
it
make
much
sense
to
fine
tune
the
lost
earnings
part
of
the
award
this
way,
when
the
jury
is
virtually
permitted
to
throw
darts
at
the
wall
on
pain
and
suffering?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
settle
for
the
boxberger
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
you
are
saying
would
require
any
rule
that
forbad
illinois
in
a
non-fela
case
from
using
whatever
jury
instruction
or
consideration
of
taxation
it
wanted
to
as
a
matter
of
state
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
if
you
could
instruct
that
you
can't
consider
the
attorneys'
fees
or
you
can,
then
you
could
also
get
to
expert
witness
fees
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
do
you
regard
as
the
strongest
of
your
two
points?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
expert
witness
testify
as
to
take-home
pay
or
as
to
gross?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
jury
during
its
deliberations
had
come
back
and
said
they
wanted
to
ask
the
judge
a
question,
and
the
question
was,
"should
we
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
wages
projected
should
be
take-home
pay,
after
you
deduct
federal
taxes,
in
computing
the
present
value
of
the
award,"
do
you
think
the
judge
should
have
answered
it,
could
have
answered
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
had
been
offered
and
refused,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
there
had
been
an
effort
to
cross-examine
the
expert.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
there
an
effort
to
cross-examine
your
expert
as
to
the
effect
of
withholding
on
the
man's
future
income?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
jury
couldn't
get
the
answer
to
that
question,
regardless
of
whether
the
judge's
preliminary
ruling
was
right
or
wrong.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
now
point
two
in
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
the
evidence
is
first
presented,
supposing
the
railroad
offers
evidence
that
the
man's
take-home
pay
was
such
and
such,
although
your
expert
has
testified
only
as
to
gross
pay,
ought
that
evidence
to
be
admitted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
10%
of
which
you
pay
for
in
your
complaint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
recover
pain
and
suffering?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
case
from
this
court
that
provides
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
illinois
law
is
totally
superseded
by
federal
law
in
fela
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
there
had
been
no
case
from
this
court,
saying
you
are
entitled
to
recover
for
loss
of
guidance
to
minor
children.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sorry.
what
case
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
am.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
face
it,
this
court
was
pro-railroad
from
1908
to
1939,
and
pro-plaintiff
from
1939
until
some
--
perhaps
still
is.
it
has
not
been
an
unwavering
line.
so
to
act
as
if
the
construction
of
the
fela
has
been
kind
of
a
straight
line
thing
since
1908,
just
isn't
accurate
in
the
light
of
the
decisions.
they
have
bent
one
way
sometimes
and
bent
the
other
way
other
times.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
boxberger
is
a
correct
statement
of
fela
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
procedural
is
concerned,
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
relief
in
the
akron
and
canton
railroad
company
was
a
procedural
ohio
rule.
and
this
court
said,
"you
can't
have
it.
it
is
a
federal
rule
and
we
are
going
to
impose
a
different
burden
of
proof."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
trial
judge
in
liepelt
felt
bound
by
illinois
law
that
you
simply
couldn't
say
anything,
in
the
exercise
of
your
discretion
or
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
doctrine
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
find
that
it
was
--
that
the
judge
was
hampered
by
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law
in
deciding
whether
to
give
a
cautionary
instruction,
you
reverse
and
remand
for
a
new
trial,
if
you
find
there
was
prejudice,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
reverse
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
you
take
it
to
the
world
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are,
those
all
fela
cases?
that
the
thirty-five
states
represent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
kelly,
perhaps,
a
different
standard
may
be
required
under
fela
cases
than
might
be
required
in
the
ordinary
tort
action,
under
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
assumes
you
would
invest
--
that
the
award
would
be
invested
and
bring
interest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
more
of
a
hodgepodge
is
it
than
$300,000
bucks
for
guidance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
totally
subjective
in
value.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
you
are
talking
about
income
taxes
is
going
to
make
the
jury
worry
about
things
that
are
difficult
and
hard
to
figure
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
these
are
extraneous.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
reducing
the
award
to
present
value.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
used
the
word
"hodgepodge."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
you
get
widely
differing
results
as
to
what
the
value
of
guidance
is,
too,
don't
you?
