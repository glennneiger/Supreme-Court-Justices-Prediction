justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
if
he
is
right
or
not,
but
if
mr.
trienens
is
right
in
suggesting
that
the
jury
gave
$700,000
on
evidence
and
only
would
support
$350,000,
whatever
the
figures
are,
isn't
this
a
perfect
case
for
applying
the
rule
in
this
very
case?
if
it
was
done
because
of
the
failure
to
give
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
--
i
must
confess
i
fail
to
see
the
relevance.
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
evidence
pertaining
to
that
person,
how
his
recovery
was,
or
how
good
his
lawyer
was.
but,
obviously,
he
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial.
i
still
don't
understand
how
that
responds
to
the
point
that
if
there
was
error
in
giving
the
instruction,
and
if
the
award
was
for
that
reason
or
arguably
for
that
reason
twice
as
large
as
it
might
have
been
otherwise,
isn't
this
a
proper
case
for
--
as
to
this
particular
litigant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
the
other
$300,000
represents
this
loss
of
guidance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
really
is
not
correct
to
talk
about
double
taxation,
is
it?
the
evidence
they
want
in
would
tend
to
reduce
the
award.
if
you
include
the
tax,
it
would
say
the
net
earnings
were
less
than
the
gross
earnings.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
put
in
the
fact
that
the
interest
on
the
award
would
be
subject
to
taxes,
that
would
tend
to
increase
the
award,
because
they
tend
to
cancel
one
and
other
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
tend
to
cancel
each
other
out,
but
they
do
not
necessarily
meet
exactly,
but
they
are
offsetting
factors.
what
you
are
saying
is
you
come
out
about
the
same
if
you
let
both
sides
in.
that
would
be
somewhat
more
accurate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1973,
a
fireman
employed
by
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
suffered
fatal
injuries
in
a
collision.
his
widow
brought
suit
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
illinois
against
the
railroad
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
and
recovered
damages
of
$775,000.
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
the
railroad
argued
that
the
jury
may
have
overestimated
the
monetary
law
suffered
by
the
fireman's
survivors
for
two
reasons.
first,
when
the
plaintiff's
expert
testified,
his
calculations
were
based
on
the
decendents
before
tax
earnings
and
the
judge
would
not
allow
the
railroad's
lawyer
to
offer
any
evidence
concerning
the
amount
of
income
taxes
paid
by
the
employee.
second,
the
judge
refused
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
plaintiff's
recovery
would
not
be
subject
to
federal
income
taxes.
the
illinois
appellate
court
affirmed
the
trial
judge
because
his
rulings
were
consistent
with
the
prevailing
practice
of
refusing
to
allow
juries
to
receive
evidence
or
instruction
concerning
the
impact
of
federal
income
taxes
on
damage
awards
in
cases
under
the
statute.
because
the
prevailing
practice
developed
at
a
time
when
federal
taxes
were
relatively
insignificant
and
because
some
courts
are
now
following
a
different
practice,
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
reverse
and
hold
that
the
wage
earner's
federal
income
taxes
are
one
of
the
factors
relevant
in
measuring
the
monetary
law
as
occasioned
by
his
death
and
further,
that
it
was
error
to
refuse
to
instruct
the
jury
that
no
taxes
would
be
--
would
be
assessed
against
this
recovery.
accordingly,
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
with
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
joins
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
