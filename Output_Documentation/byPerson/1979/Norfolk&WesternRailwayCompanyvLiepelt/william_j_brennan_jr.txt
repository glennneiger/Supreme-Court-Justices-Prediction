the
nontaxability
of
the
award.
wouldn't
that
have
general
significance
throughout
federal
law?
for
example,
the
antitrust
laws
and
every
place
else
where
you
have
federal
judgments.
is
it
your
position
that
in
all
those
cases
the
tax
consequence
of
the
award
should
be
explained
to
the
jury?
justice
william

how
could
the
jury
really
do
you
in
in
the
death
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
this
fear
really
become
real?
wouldn't
it
be
perfectly
obvious
to
an
appellate
court
that
the
jury

the
damages,
or
not?

may
not
be
in
a
pain
and
suffering
case,
but
that
isn't
so
here.
you
just
told
us
that
this
depends
on

in
these
mcweeney

when
does
the
tax
impact
on
the
future
earnings
become
important?
when
it
passes
the
middle?
