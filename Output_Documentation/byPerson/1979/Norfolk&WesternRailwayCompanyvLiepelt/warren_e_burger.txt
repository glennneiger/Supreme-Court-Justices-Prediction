chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1323,
norfolk
and
western
railway
against
liepelt.
mr.
trienens,
we
will
let
you
get
started.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
instruction
you
requested
had
been
given,
would
you
be
here
--
and
the
same
verdict
had
come
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
a
combination
of
the
tax
instruction,
in
other
words.
if
that
had
been
given,
you
indicate
you
would
not
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
i
meant
the
whole
tax
aspect.
if
you
had
gotten
the
instruction
you
wanted
on
both
aspects
of
the
tax
problem,
and
had
the
same
verdict,
then
all
you
would
have
left
was
a
claim
of
an
excessive
verdict,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
cross-examine
him
about
what
the
figures
would
be
if
he
took
income
taxes
out
--
i
say
you,
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
it
is
more
or
less
complicated
or
speculative
than
measuring
the
value
of
his
services
fixing
the
screen
windows
and
painting
the
trim
on
the
house,
and
what
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
your
clients
have
an
offer
of
proof
showing
what
these
figures
would
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
can
look
at
it
and
see
its
significance
here
now,
can't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
trying
to
get
it
out
of
that
rut?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
an
fela
coverage
of
someone
with
a
salary
of
the
president
of
general
motors,
but
you
had
someone
up
in
the
$500,000
a
year
bracket
this
would
become
an
enormous
element.
of
course,
we
are
getting
out
of
the
range
of
this
case.
say,
just
an
ordinary
common
law
death
case,
statutory
death
case.
you
couldn't
show
that
more
than
half
of
$500,000
taxes
are
going
to
come
out
of
this
man's
income.
you
would
have
greater
distortion
than
you
have
here,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fleisher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
say
the
instruction
would
be
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
permit
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
which
was
excluded
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory,
each
individual
judge
in
the
country
is
to
make
his
own
way
on
what
he
thinks
is
the
best
way
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
on
net
take-home
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wondered
whether
you
are
bracketing
them
both.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
isn't
a
discount
for
the
issue
we
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
have
been
talking
about
all
these
other
states
and
what
they
have
done,
sometimes
cases
get
here
because
a
rule
which
has
extant
for
quite
a
while
is
in
need
of
reexamination
and
the
rule
gets
changed;
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
logic
supports
the
exclusion
of
evidence
about
taxes,
logic
now,
not
precedent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
excluded
precedent.
i
said
never
mind
what
the
states
are
doing
or
what
other
federal
courts
do,
what
is
the
logic
that
supports
the
exclusion
of
this
very
relevant
evidence
in
ordinary
matters
of
common
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
couldn't
the
instruction
be
tailored
to
eliminate
that
risk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
trienens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
1323,
norfolk
and
western
railway
company
against
liepelt
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren

you,
mr.
justice
stevens.
