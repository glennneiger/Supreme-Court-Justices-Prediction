mr.
bruno,
was
there
some
--
title
vii
was
already
on
the
books?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
there
some
comparison
with
title
vii
as
to
what
the
standard
was?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
in
the
passage
of
this
act.
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
in
your
own
time.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bruno,
is
it
your
submission
that
just
standing
alone
the
phrase
"practice
discrimination"
implies
intent?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
unlawful
to
practice
discrimination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
do
you
say,
without
reference
to
anything
else
in
the
statute,
that
that
implies
intentional?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
just
a
matter
of
meaning
of
words?
justice
potter
stewart
the
practice
of
discrimination
would
imply
intent.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
and
we
would
agree
with
you,
but
maybe
congress
didn't.
that
is
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
demotion.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
say,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
word
"discriminate"
or
"engage
in
discrimination,"
to
use
the
statutory
language,
standing
alone
implies
some
kind
of
an
intention?
i
mean,
if
you
had
discriminatory
effect,
then
that
would
have
its
own
meaning,
but
"engage
in
discrimination,"
doesn't
that
imply
intent?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
a
consciousness
and
awareness.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
aware
of
the
second
circuit
judgment
in
this
case,
because
that
hadn't
occurred
yet.
