mr.
wade
h.
mccree
may
it
please
the
court.
we
understand
that
petitioners
do
not
contest
the
substantial
disproportions
in
the
assignment
of
full-time
minority
teachers;
further,
they
do
not
deny
that
the
schools
were
statistically
racially
identifiable
as
a
result
of
the
disparities
in
staff
assignments.
they
argue
that
the
statute
and
regulations
must
be
construed
to
require
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
establish
that
the
disparities
resulted
from
purposeful
or
intentional
discrimination
in
the
constitutional
sense.
although
on
remand,
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
found
the
petitioners'
teacher
assignment
policies
were
unconstitutional,
and
the
district
court
affirmed,
we
do
not
have
to
decide
we
submit
whether
the
administrative
record
supports
that
finding
because
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
declined
to
address
that
question.
also
we
need
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals'
dictum
about
the
sufficiency
of
an
objective
test
for
a
violation
of
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
is
present.
the
regulation,
45
code
of
federal
regulations
185.43
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
we
submit
that
it
does
not
incorporate
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
think
if
this
court
agrees
with
him,
then
its
course
would
be
to
remand
this
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
address
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
shown
on
the
administrative
record.
and
we
think
it
does
but
we
don't
propose
to
argue
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
we
don't
understand
the
petitioner
to
make
that
contention.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
i
think
it
rests
certainly
on
the
spending
power.
it
might
rest
on
the
implementation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
decide
that
either.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
there
might
be
a
problem
there.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
if
congress,
for
example,
thought
that
it
would
be
good
to
promote
foreign
language
instruction
in
public
schools,
it
could
appropriate
special
funds
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
public
schools
to
inaugurate
or
strengthen
existing
foreign
language
programs
and
it
could
provide
for
certain
qualifications
and
for
certain
disqualifying
features.
for
example,
it
might
say
that
a
teacher
to
whom
the
language
to
be
taught
is
not
a
native
tongue
may
not
participate
in
this
program,
and
i
suppose
then
we
would
just
look
to
see
whether
the
statute
was
followed
in
the
particular
case
and
whether
the
regulations
promulgated
to
enforce
it
were
authorized
by
the
statute.
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
as
we
see
this,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
congress
is
not
directing
the
states
to
participate
in
this
program;
as
my
brother,
mr.
bruno,
has
suggested,
this
is
a
carrot
on
the
stick.
if
the
state
wishes
to
do
so,
it
may
do
so,
but
if
it
does
it
may
not
be
disqualified
as
provided
for
in
1605(d)
as
we
urge.
the
regulation
clearly
makes
the
school
board
ineligible
if
it
has
assigned
its
teachers
"in
such
a
manner
as
to
identify
any
of
such
schools
as
intended
for
students
of
a
particular
race,
color
or
national
origin."
we
do
not
understand
the
petitioners
to
challenge
at
all
the
determination
that
these
schools
are
so
identifiable,
so
we
are
right
at
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
congress
showed
that
it
knew
how
to
require
unconstitutional
or
purposeful
discrimination
when
it
wanted
to,
and
we
refer
to
section
1605(d)
where
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court,
my
brother
sought
to
make
the
point
that
discrimination
there
was
purposeful
and
indeed
it
is
because
it
says
in
order
to
avoid
the
participation
of
minority
group
children.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
concessions
that
petitioner
makes
in
his
brief
and
those
my
brother
mr.
bruno
made
in
his
argument
yesterday
affirm
the
accuracy
of
the
government's
statement
of
the
question
in
its
brief.
we
stated
the
question
to
be
whether
the
emergency
school
aid
act
authorizes
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
withhold
the
special
funds
provided
under
that
statutory
program
from
a
school
district
whose
faculty
assignment
policies
have
a
disparate
racial
impact
most
justified
by
educational
needs,
without
a
showing
that
they
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
argued
yesterday
that
section
1605(d)(1)(b)
which
is
the
statutory
provision
providing
for
disqualification
of
certain
school
districts,
establishes
a
result
test
for
the
disproportionate
demotion
or
dismissal
of
faculty
or
other
personnel,
and
this
of
course
requires
us
to
focus
on
the
second
clause
which
provides
"or
otherwise
engaged
in
discrimination
based
upon
race,
color
or
national
origin
in
the
hiring,
promotion
or
assignment
of
employees."
and
of
course,
the
construction
that
the
court
accords
to
this
clause
will
determine
the
validity
of
the
regulation
which
petitioner
admits
has
not
been
adhered
to
by
its
school
board.
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
reason
why
racially
disparate
hiring,
promotion
or
assignment
should
produce
a
result
different
from
disproportionate
demotion
or
dismissal
to
justify
the
requirement
of
a
motive
for
one
and
not
for
the
other.
and
we
have
endeavored
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
indeed
the
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i
have
tried
to
surmise
why
the
congress
used
different
language
in
these
two
instances.
and
i
think
the
best
argument
that
occurs
to
me
at
this
time
is
as
follows.
the
attention
of
the
congress
was
focused
upon
what
had
been
de
jure
separate
school
systems
in
the
south
which,
of
course,
were
dual
school
systems
and
were
duplicative
in
so
many
respects.
there
was
the
white
school
and
there
were,
as
were
known
in
those
days,
the
"colored
schools,"
and
there
were
principles
for
each,
administrative
personnel
for
each,
as
well
as
instructional
personnel
or
faculty,
and
the
congress
was
concerned
that
in
the
dismantlement
of
dual
systems
that
black
employees
or
minority
employees
would
be
disproportionately
fired.
for
example,
if
the
system
had
40
white
principals
and
10
black
principals
for
a
total
of
50,
and
it
ended
up
that
it
just
needed
40
once
the
separate
system
was
to
be
dismantled,
the
congress
focused
its
attention
to
the
situation
which
might
result
in
the
firing
of
all
10
black
principals,
and
therefore
the
language
"disproportionate
dismissal."
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
seems
appropriate.
however,
one
has
difficulty
with
a
concept
such
as
disproportionate
hiring.
what
does
disproportionate
hiring
mean?
i
have
difficulty
with
that.
does
this
mean
that
if
5
candidates
present
themselves,
4
of
one
race
and
1
of
another,
that
to
hire
any
other
than
a
4-to-1
ratio
would
be
disproportionate?
this
does
not
make
sense
to
me
in
terms
of
whether
the
candidates
had
the
skills
that
were
needed
at
the
time
--
one
might
be
a
latin
teacher,
an
english
teacher,
a
french
teacher,
and
so
on.
i
have
even
more
trouble
with
the
notion
of
disproportionate
assignment
if
it
means
in
proportion
to
what?
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
people
in
the
school
system?
and
i
don't
think
the
congress
wanted
to
establish
a
quota
in
the
establishment
of
schools
and
the
hiring
and
promotion
and
assignment
of
course
looks
towards
establishment
and
not
disestablishment.
and
for
that
reason
it
would
seem
to
used
the
phrase
"otherwise
discriminate"
allows
more
latitude
in
the
establishment
and
ongoing
conduct
of
a
school
district.
and
that
satisfies
me
as
a
sufficient
reason
for
using
different
language,
but
still
having
a
results
test,
and
as
the
regulation
provides,
the
results
test
is
met
if
the
discrimination
in
hiring
or
assignment
results
in
the
school
being
identified
as
a
school
for
children
or
for
students
of
a
particular
race,
color,
or
national
origin.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
think
that
is
what
it
means;
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
it
means.
but
that
doesn't
mean
discriminate
in
the
sense
of
a
constitutionally
impermissible
discernment
of
who
the
persons
were,
because
obviously
they
have
to
discern
who
they
are
to
avoid
the
disproportionate
dismissal
or
demotion.
so
discrimination
occurs
in
that
process,
too.
and
yet
it
is
conceded
that
that
is
a
results
test.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
i
think
it
certainly
implies
awareness
or
discernment.
discrimination
means
to
be
aware
of
a
difference,
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
to
implement.
i
can
discriminate
between
colors
or
among
colors.
that
doesn't
mean
i
am
going
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
just
have
a
capacity
to
know,
it's
an
awareness.
and
again
we're
talking
about
a
results
test
and
it
would
just
appear
that
the
congress
used
that
phrase,
"otherwise
discriminate,"
to
mean
otherwise
produce
a
result
that
would
show
that
the
statutory
purpose
which
of
course
was
to
eliminate
the
distinction
between
de
jure
and
de
facto
and
to
protect
the
children
from
the
harmful
result
from
racial
isolation,
as
was
stated
in
the
congressional
statement
of
purpose.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it
is
quite
the
latter,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
school
board
may
apply
for
a
waiver
of
the
condition
of
eligibility,
and
if
the
waiver
is
granted,
the
school
aid
monies
are
paid
forthwith.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
to
correct
the
situation
would
render
them
ineligible
but
for
the
waiver
system.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
three
and
a
half
million
dollars.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
exactly
my
understanding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
companion
case
called
polfield
which
involves
an
ongoing
dialogue
between
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
the
school
board.
there
is
also
another
case
that
involves
a
request
for
a
waiver
and
the
rejection
of
the
request
of
the
waiver
because
of
the
department's
determination
that
the
ineligibility
demonstrated
in
this
case
had
not
been
successfully
removed.
and
in
all
of
these
cases
the
funds
that
had
been
preliminarily
set
aside
are
still
there.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
the
consequence
is
that
the
school
board
then
does
not
receive
the
funds
requested,
but
the
school
board
may
request
a
waiver
of
eligibility.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
the
regulation
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
the
waiver
procedure
is
available.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
it
could
be
if
it
were
the
policy
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
punish,
but
it
isn't
at
all.
these
are
funds
in
addition
to
funds
that
the
school
board
would
otherwise
have,
and
the
funds
are
made
available
to
assist
the
school
in
achieving
the
congressional
goals
here,
which
are
to
eliminate
what
in
the
north
was
called
de
facto
segregation
because
of
the
congressional
finding
that
it
was
harmful
to
the
children
who
were
in
that
kind
of
situation.
we
mention
in
our
brief
a
quotation
from
senator
stennis
which
--
i
would
like
to
read
this.
this
is
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
i
beg
your
pardon;
i
said
senator
stennis,
it
was
senator
eastland
who
says,
"i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
a
10-year-old
colored
student
in
a
public
school
in
(inaudible)
watts,
or
south
chicago
is
expected
to
look
around
and
see
nothing
but
black
faces
in
his
classroom
and
say
to
himself,
'this
kind
of
racial
separation
does
not
hurt
me
because
the
state
of
illinois
does
not
have
a
law
requiring
me
to
attend
all
black
schools.
i
should
not
feel
hurt
by
this
racial
separation
because
it
is
a
result
of
housing
patterns
that
just
accidentally
happened.'"
so
this
legislation
was
intended
to
relieve
that
situation
as
well
as
one
where
a
state
statute
mandated
it,
and
we
submit
that
a
school
board
that
wishes
to
participate
in
doing
that,
even
if
the
courts
could
not
compel
him
to
do
it
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
oh,
yes,
i
would
think
so.
but
the
economic
reality
is
that
all
school
boards
are
desperately
in
need
of
funds
and
these
funds
are
available
and
they
can
be
obtained,
and
the
waiver
process
is
there.
as
part
of
the
history
of
this
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
oh,
yes,
for
several
different
kinds
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it
might
happen
that
way,
except
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
monitors
it
and
endeavors
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
oh,
no,
the
school
raises
its
own
money
from
its
own
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
i
think
title
vi
might
come
into
play
at
that
point.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
if
the
school
board
is
guilty
of
constitutionally
prohibited
discrimination
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
not
to
be
in
violation
of
esaa.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
then
one
would
have
to
look
to
the
authorizing
provisions
and
provision
for
ineligibility
if
any
in
that
other
statutory
scheme.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
funds
under
this
statute
would,
as
i
understand
it,
but
not
necessarily
under
other
statutory
--
i
don't
read
it
to
say
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
if
i
understand
the
court
to
use
discrimination
to
mean
de
facto
as
well
as
de
jure.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it's
to,
if
i
might
--
yes,
my
answer
is
yes,
and
1601(b)(1),
or
1601(a)
and
(b),
where
the
congressional
purpose
is
set
out,
in
(a)
it
says,
"congress
finds
that
the
process
of
eliminating
or
preventing
minority
group
isolation
and
improving
the
quality
of
education
for
all
children
requires
additional
funds,"
and
in
(b),
"to
meet
the
special
needs
incident
to
the
elimination
of
minority
group
segregation
and
discrimination
among
students,"
so
it's
corrective
and
goes
beyond,
as
we
understand
it.
as
we
argued
yesterday,
we
believe
that
we
have
here
just
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
it
makes
sense
to
apply
a
results
test
to
the
second
clause
of
1605(d)(1)(b),
as
well
as
to
the
first
clause,
where
concededly
a
results
test
is
required.
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
by
making
a
reference
to
the
amicus
brief.
we
think
this,
at
the
very
last
part
of
the
amicus
brief,
it
is
pointed
out
that
in
1977,
i
believe
it
is,
under
the
educational
amendment
act,
this
esaa
statute
was
reenacted,
and
at
the
time
it
was
reenacted,
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
regulation
that
is
under
attack
here,
and
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
regulation
and
of
its
effect,
and
nonetheless
the
statutory
language
was
not
changed,
which
at
least
would
give
us
some
indication
that
this
was
not
contrary
to
congressional
intent
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
not
aware
of
that.
but
it
was
aware
of
the
regulation.
on
page
42
of
the
amicus
brief,
i
believe
there's
a
discussion
of
it
and
there's
a
reference
to
senator
javits
who,
of
course,
represents
the
state
in
which
the
school
district
here
is
involved,
and
he
was
aware
of
this
at
that
time.
and
so,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
is
appropriately
interpreting
the
statutory
authority
for
his
regulations
and
that
the
regulations
are
reasonably
calculated
to
carry
out
the
congressional
intent
and
purpose
and
for
these
reasons
and
the
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
