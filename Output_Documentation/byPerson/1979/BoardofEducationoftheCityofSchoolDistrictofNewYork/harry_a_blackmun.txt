justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
presents
a
narrow
but
we
think
important
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
concerns
a
school
district's
eligibility
for
federal
financial
assistance
under
the
1972
emergency
school
aid
act.
and
because
the
federal
funds
available
under
that
act
are
limited,
educational
agencies
compete
for
the
funds.
the
act
has
its
--
its
purpose
the
provision
of
federal
financial
assistance
to
meet
special
needs
incident
to
the
elimination
of
minority
group
segregation
in
elementary
and
secondary
schools
to
encourage
the
voluntary
elimination
of
minority
group
by
isolation
and
to
aid
children
in
overcoming
the
educational
disadvantages
of
minority
group
isolation.
a
section
of
the
act
pronounces
as
federal
policy
that
guidelines
and
criteria
established
under
the
act
should
be
applied
uniformly
to
all
regions
of
the
united
states.
another
section,
the
one
that
is
critical
here
declares
an
agency
ineligible
for
financial
assistance
if
after
the
date
of
the
act,
it
had
any
practice
which
results
in
the
disproportionate
demotion
or
dismissal
of
personnel
from
minority
groups
or
otherwise
engages
in
discrimination
in
the
hiring,
promotion
or
assignment
of
employees.
the
new
york
city
board,
the
petitioner
here,
applied
for
assistance
under
the
act
but
it
was
denied
because
a
compliance
investigation
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
showed
a
pattern
of
racially
disproportionate
assignments
of
minority
teachers
in
the
system.
the
board
did
not
contest
the
statistical
disparities
but
it
claimed
that
the
disproportionate
assignments
resulted
from
provisions
of
state
law
from
collective
bargaining
agreements
from
licensing
requirements
from
a
bilingual
instruction
consent
decree
and
from
demographic
changes
in
student
population.
the
district
court
in
this
litigation
concluded
that
hew
should
have
considered
these
proffered
justifications.
it
therefore
remanded
to
the
agency
for
further
consideration.
on
that
remand,
hew
determined
that
the
justifications
did
not
adequately
rebut
the
prima
facie
evidence
of
discrimination.
then
back
in
the
district
court,
the
hew
upheld
the
finding
of
ineligibility
and
denied
relief.
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
discriminatory
impact
is
the
standard
by
which
ineligibility
under
the
act
is
to
be
measured
and
that
this
is
so
irrespective
of
whether
the
discrimination
relates
to
demotion
or
dismissal
of
personnel
or
to
the
hiring,
promotion,
or
assignment
of
employees.
to
treat
as
ineligible
only
an
applicant
with
a
past
or
a
conscious
present
intent
to
perpetuate
racial
isolation
would
defeat
the
stated
objective
of
ending
de
facto
as
well
as
de
jure
segregation.
and
we
thus
reject
the
board's
argument
that
disparate
impact
was
applicable
to
demotions
and
dismissals
but
that
intent
to
discriminate
was
essential
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
relating
to
assignment
of
employees.
we
further
hold
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
discriminatory
impact
may
be
made
by
proper
statistical
study
that
such
a
case
was
established
here
and
that
the
burden
of
rebutting
it
is
on
the
applicant.
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
and
i'm
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
