will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-873,
board
of
education

new

v.
harris,
the
secretary
of
hew.
mr.
bruno,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
language
"which
results"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
pick
up
there
at
10:00
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
resume
where
you
left
off
yesterday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
turn,
if
you
will,
to
the
consequences
of
the
department's
determination
that
there
is
a
violation;
the
consequence
is
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
under
regulations,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
any
event
it's
available,
the
waiver
procedure
is
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
the
next
step
in
my
inquiry.
if
the
consequence
is
to
take
this
money
away
from
the
board
of
education,
the
next
consequence
is
that
what
is
regarded
as
a
bad
situation
may
become
worse,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
adverse
consequences,
to
some
extent,
falls
on
the
very
people
congress
intended
to
benefit;
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
bruno,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
likely
that
in
a
situation
where
the
possible
violation
is
in
a
gray
zone,
is
uncertain,
that
an
adjustment
is
negotiated
and
a
waiver
of
any
claims
of
the
secretary
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
board
of
education
against
harris
--
secretary
harris
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
