mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
bruno,
and
i
am
assistant
corporation
counsel
of
the
city
of
new
york.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
school
district
of
the
city
of
new
york.
this
case
presents
this
court
the
issue
of
the
proper
test
of
discrimination
under
a
federal
grant
statute
known
as
the
emergency
school
aid
act
as
well
as
the
proper
test
of
discrimination
under
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
as
well
as
interrelationship
between
esaa
and
title
vi.
it
is
the
position
of
hew
and
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
test
of
discrimination
under
both
esaa
and
title
vi
is
a
disparate
impact
test.
the
board's
position
is
that
under
esaa
and
title
vi,
the
test
of
discrimination
is
a
constitutional
intent
test.
a
bit
about
the
facts.
the
esaa
statute
sets
up
a
competition
in
this
country
among
school
districts
who
seek
to
apply
for
a
limited
pool
of
esaa
funds
of
approximately
$1.5
billion.
proposals
are
submitted
to
hew
for
grading
on
programmatic
merits
and
a
program
would
be
funded
if
it
came
within
the
range
of
programmatic
merits
except
if
it
was
found
to
be
ineligible
under
the
provisions
of
section
1605(d)(1)
of
the
esaa
statute.
suffice
to
say
that
the
board
of
education
submitted
a
proposal,
was
found
to
have
sufficient
programmatic
merit,
was
denied
funding
under
section
1605(d)(1)(b)
when
hew
found
that
certain
of
the
new
york
city
high
schools
were
racially
identifiable
based
upon
staff
assignments.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
it
involves
the
existing
practice.
it
was
a
basis
for
finding
ineligibility.
that
is
the
ineligibility
section
of
the
esaa
statute.
it
does
not
relate
to
the
individual
proposals.
the
proposals
are
apart
from
it.
this
is
a
basis
upon
ineligibility.
it
talks
about
current
practices
or
activities.
the
finding
of
ineligibility
was
based
essentially
on
a
statistical
report
done
by
hew
in
relation
to
a
1976
ocr
non-compliance
letter.
the
validity
of
that
determination
of
ineligibility
was
the
subject
of
at
least
two
reviews
at
hew,
was
conceded
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
before
judge
jack
b.
weinstein,
and
appealed
to
the
second
circuit.
now,
the
circuit
held
that
esaa
itself
requires
application
of
an
impact
test
in
determining
eligibility
for
funding
on
the
issue
of
staff
assignments.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
title
vi
incorporates
an
impact
test
and
therefore
that
the
staff
assignment
policy
of
the
board
also
violated
title
vi.
let
me
deal
first
with
the
esaa
statute.
the
subdivision
i
have
indicated
is
section
1605(d)(1)(b).
it
states
"no
educational
agency
shall
be
eligible
for
assistance
under
this
chapter
if
it
has
as
of
june
23,
1972,
it
has
had
or
maintained
in
effect
any
other
practice,
policy,
or
procedure
which
results
in
district
apportion
the
demotion
or
dismissal
of
instructional
or
other
staff,
minority
staff
in
conjunction
with
a
desegregation
plan"
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
we
do
not,
and
we
concede
with
respect
to
demotions
and
dismissal--the
issue
in
this
case
is
assignment
of
staff
--
with
respect
to
demotions
and
dismissals,
we
concede
that
is
a
disparate
impact
test
for
a
very
clear
rationale.
with
respect
to
the
assignment
of
staff,
however,
the
language
is
"otherwise
engage
in
discrimination."
based
on
race
color
and
national
origin
in
the
assignment
of
staff
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case
we
can
see
that
the
motion
to
dismissals
to
is
in
despaired
impact
test
for
a
very
clear
rational
and
congress
so
stated,
i
will
get
to
a
virtue
of
it
with
respect
to
assignment
of
staff
however
the
languages
are
otherwise
in
case
of
discrimination.
hew
contends
that
this
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
obvious
that
the
test
applicable,
which
we
concede
is
the
disparate
impact
to
the
motion
to
dismissal,
is
the
same
test
that
should
be
applicable
to
the
assignment
of
staff.
i
would
submit
that
the
congress
used
very
different
terms
when
it
dealt
with
demotions
and
dismissals
as
opposed
to
assignment
of
staff.
i
would
also
note
that
in
this
section
1605(d)(1)
which
is
the
entire
ineligibility
section
here,
five
activities
that
render
a
board
ineligible,
within
this
section
it
uses
discrimination
twice.
it
uses
it
in
subdivision
(d)
which
deals
with
avoidance
of
minority
group
participation
in
curricular
or
extracurricular
activities
so
as
to
discriminate
against
them
--
that
is
the
other
place
that
it
is
used.
hew
concedes
that
there
that
is
an
intent
test.
we
say
that
if
congress
knew
what
it
was
talking
about
with
subdivision
(d)
it
certainly
knew
what
it
was
talking
about
with
respect
to
subdivision
(b)
dealing
with
staff
assignments.
hew
could
do
nothing
with
that.
i
would
note
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
what
did
congress
intend
when
it
used
the
word
"discrimination."
hew
contends
that
the
legislative
history
is
extremely
relevant,
yet
they
totally
ignore
perhaps
the
most
relevant
legislative
history
in
dealing
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
"discrimination."
they
say
not
one
word
in
their
brief
about
senate
committee
report
92-61
which
states
in
essence
that
one
and
only
one
practice
in
subdivision
6105
(d)(1)(b)
is
presumed
to
be
discriminatory
if
disparate
impact
exists.
that
speaks
directly
to
subdivision
(b).
subdivision
(b)
has
two
types
of
activities,
demotions
and
dismissals
and
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
assignment
of
staff.
they
are
two
very
distinct
clauses
in
it.
that
committee
report
makes
it
clear
that
one
and
only
one
is
presumed
to
be
discriminatory.
hew
ignores
the
language
later
on
in
that
same
senate
committee
report
where
it
states,
"the
phrase
disproportionate
to
demotions
or
dismissals
is
not
modified
nor
in
any
way
diminished
by
the
substantive
phrase
or
otherwise
engaged
in
discrimination
in
the
assignment
of
staff."
these
are
two
separate
and
distinct
clauses.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
oh,
no,
they
are
bound
to
follow
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
the
statute.
we
say
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
this
is
to
require
an
intentional
discrimination
test
for
assignment
of
staff.
let
me
tell
you
why.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
my
last
argument
was
the
reliance
on
the
senate
committee
report
indicating
what
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
in
passing
this
particular
statute
and
this
particular
section.
let
me
say
further,
beyond
that,
there
is
other
ample
proof
of
what
the
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
used
the
word
"discrimination."
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
absolutely
not,
i
am
not
saying
that,
but
i
am
saying
that
that
language
in
that
committee
report
taken
with
the
legislative
history,
indicates
the
intent
of
the
discrimination
test
for
this
section
of
the
statute
which
is
the
eligibility
section
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
1972,
the
language
of
the
section
was
enacted,
the
meaning
of
the
word
"discrimination"
as
discussed
by
congress,
it
was
very
clear
what
they
were
talking
about.
they
were
talking
about
swann,
they
were
talking
about
brown,
they
were
talking
about
intentional
segregation,
de
jure
segregation,
and
they
were
enacting
this
section.
in
fact,
rep.
dellenback
said
esaa
does
not
alter
in
any
way
the
legal
aspects
of
desegregation,
its
purpose
is
to
help
school
districts
see
that
existing
law
is
enforced.
senator
mondale,
in
discussing
this,
talked
about
swann
and
said
the
only
actual
discrimination
we
have
is
de
jure
intentional
segregation.
hew
argues
that
it
is
equally
plausible
that
discrimination
can
mean
disparate
impact
and
they
allude
to
title
vii.
they
ignore,
for
one,
the
discussion
of
desegregation
and
the
cases
that
we
were
talking
about,
of
swann
and
brown.
they
ignore
that
briggs
had
come
down
in
march
of
1971
and
not
one
statement
about
briggs
in
the
title
vii
case.
they
ignore
that
in
the
third
section,
1605(d)(1),
discrimination
is
mentioned
twice.
they
can
see
in
subdivision
(d)
that
it
is
an
intent
test,
and
now
they
wish
to
ignore
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
oh,
yes,
1964.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
are
you
talking
about
hew?
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
oh,
yes,
absolutely,
and
i
will
get
to
that
if
you
would
like.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
all
right.
let
me
just
go
into
the
rationale
for
the
demotion
and
dismissals
test.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
your
honor,
they
use
the
word
"discrimination"
and
we
think
that
it
is
extremely
important
that
we
use
that.
let
me
talk
a
bit
about
the
language
of
that
subdivision
(d)
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
yes,
we
agree
that
that
is
an
intent
standard.
we
also
feel
that
the
(b)
section
is
also.
they
rely
essentially
on
the
word
"otherwise,"
if
you
look
at
their
brief.
they
rely
on
the
use
of
the
word
"otherwise"
to
indicate
that
the
test
used
for
demotions
and
dismissals
should
be
the
same
test
used
for
staff
assignments
and
they
say
"otherwise"
denotes
commonality
or
similarity.
they
say
it
is
obvious
from
using
the
word.
well,
i
just
did
very
little
research
on
that
and
looked
in
the
dictionary
and
the
word
"otherwise"
does
not
mean
commonality
or
similarity,
it
means
contrast.
now,
it
could
mean
that
and
i
would
not
say
that
it
could
not
mean
that
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
but
i
think
if
we
look
at
how
it
was
used
here
and
if
we
consider
--
if
congress
wanted
to
say
demotions
and
dismissals,
the
same
test
applied
to
demotions
and
dismissals
and
used
the
same
test,
all
they
would
have
to
say
is
disproportionate
to
demotions,
dismissals,
assignment
of
staff,
hiring
and
promotions.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
broke
this
up
in
the
legislative
history.
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
why
i
cite
senate
committee
report
92-61,
because
i
think
that
points
out
that
they
were
talking
about
two
separate
clauses.
the
rationale
for
the
disparate
impact
test
for
demotions
and
dismissals
is
very
clear.
hew
ignores
what
we
say
about
this
in
their
brief.
senate
committee
report
92-61
points
out
that
congress
was
concerned
that
the
districts
at
this
time
that
had
desegregation
orders
against
them
were
demoting
and
dismissing
black
principals
and
staff
in
the
south,
and
what
senator
mondale
said
during
the
debates
was
that
there
have
been
wholesale
firing
of
black
teachers
and
principals
in
the
south
in
conjunction
with
desegregation
orders.
so
when
they
passed
this
section
dealing
with
demotions
and
dismissals,
a
disproportionate
demotions
and
dismissals
in
conjunction
with
desegregation
order,
so
the
rationale
is
very
clear.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
the
word
"discrimination"
as
it
was
used
there,
which
we
indicate
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
in
that
statute
we
believe
it
does.
we
believe
it
does.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
and
i
would
say
not
only
the
meaning
of
the
words
but
the
juxtaposition
in
that
statute,
the
way
they
use
them.
when
they
want
to
talk
about
disproportionate
disparate
impact
test,
they
use
the
term
disproportionate.
they
changed
the
term
and
they
could
very
easily
have
kept
that
term
to
deal
with
the
remaining
elements.
hew
would
have
us
believe
that
all
they
are
really
doing
there
is
saying
disproportionate
demotions
or
dismissals
and
all
the
rest
follow
that
test.
for
one,
it
doesn't
read
that
way
and
i
say
it
is
illogical.
it
is
not
what
they
ware
doing.
they
use
discrimination
twice.
hew
relies
on
another
section,
and
so
does
the
court
of
appeals
in
finding
that
a
disparate
impact
that
applies
to
esaa
eligibility,
they
rely
on
section
1602(a)
of
the
esaa
statute.
at
the
time
that
esaa
was
introduced,
there
was
considerable
discussion
in
congress
about
doing
something
about
de
facto
segregation.
they
wanted
to
do
something
but
they
realized
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
elsewhere
were
prohibiting
them
from
doing
something
about
de
facto
segregation.
so
what
they
did
was
they
passed
esaa.
they
said
if
you
want
esaa
money,
in
order
to
be
eligible
you
must
establish
that
you
are
implementing
a
court
ordered
desegregation
order
or
you
are
going
to
do
it
voluntarily.
what
were
they
trying
to
do?
they
were
trying
to
do
away
with
de
facto
segregation
by
offering
a
carrot
to
districts
they
could
not
get
after
the
courts,
but
saying
do
away
with
de
facto
segregation
and
we
will
offer
you
this
esaa
funding.
section
1602(a)
states
--
and
so
much
is
placed
on
this
section,
there
is
so
much
discussion
in
hew's
brief
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
it
states
essentially,
"that
guidelines
and
criteria
of
esaa
be
applied
uniformally
without
regards
to
the
origin
of
cause
of
segregation."
what
that
means
is
that
esaa
money
be
made
available
to
districts
regardless
of
whether
it
is
de
jure
or
de
facto
segregation,
go
out
and
do
something,
it
was
broadening
these
eligibilities.
they
would
have
us
believe
that
1602(a)
meant
a
disparate
impact
test
for
esaa
eligibility.
well,
if
they
had
meant
that,
that
at
least
one
element
of
ineligibility
in
subdivision
(b)
knocks
that
logic
out
totally.
i
would
like
now
to
get
to
the
title
vi
discussion.
perhaps
the
most
--
we
feel
that
perhaps
the
most
important
and
significant
error
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
its
failure
to
assess
the
impact
of
the
bakke
decision
on
the
standards
of
discrimination
applicable
under
title
vi.
the
court
cited
bakke
in
its
title
vii
language
but
at
least
i
think
in
our
petition
for
cert
inexplicably
they
said
nothing
about
the
bakke
case
with
respect
to
title
vi.
instead,
they
cited
lau
v.
nichols.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
title
vi
as
an
additional
basis
for
finding
that
the
disparate
impact
test
applies
to
esaa
eligibility.
hew
has
determined
that
title
vi
is
not
an
issue.
i
say
it
is
a
rather
cavalier
determination
because
in
our
petition
for
cert,
perhaps
the
most
important
and
perhaps
our
strongest
point
was
the
court
of
appeals
failure
to
even
note
the
bakke
decision
in
discussing
title
vi.
title
vi,
whether
it
is
the
standard
for
esaa
or
title
vi
is
the
standard
establishing
what
is
discrimination
we
say
in
this
context,
but
whether
it
provides
the
actual
standard
for
esaa
eligibility
or
not
is
certainly
interrelated,
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was.
their
language
says
that
it
is.
the
statistics
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
hew
relied
in
finding
the
board
ineligible
was
in
title
vi
non-compliance
letters.
title
vi
is
a
major
enforcement
now
for
all
federal
funding.
esaa
is
incorporated
through
a
series
of
amendments
to
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1964.
title
vi
enforces
that
act
and
the
procedural
aspect
of
enforcement
is
codified
in
title
vi.
secretary
finch
during
the
esaa
debates
said,
when
asked
whether
a
district
would
be
eligible
for
esaa
funding
and
it
was
discriminating
in
the
assignment
of
teachers,
he
stated
that
such
a
district
would
not
be
eligible
because
it
would
be
violating
title
vi.
the
second
circuit
in
a
later
decision
cited
in
our
main
brief,
parents
association
of
andrew
jackson,
has
now
said
--
i
will
read
it
"we
think
that
title
vi
does
not
authorize
federal
judges
to
impose
a
school
desegregation
remedy
where
there
is
no
constitutional
transgression
--
i.e.,
where
a
racial
imbalance
is
merely
de
facto."
so
even
the
second
circuit
in
issuing
this
decision
was
wondering
if
they
did
the
right
thing.
they
say
the
continued
viability
of
lau
is
suspect
and
they
are
waiting
this
court's
consideration
perhaps
in
this
case
or
another
case.
the
second
circuit
in
the
jackson
decision
went
into
a
bifurcated
view
of
title
vi.
it
is
in
our
brief
and
i
really
don't
think
i
should
go
over
it
in
any
great
detail.
but
what
it
did
was
it
went
through
such
a
tortured
reasoning
of
title
vi
to
find
that
in
this
context,
in
this
very
case
that
a
disparate
impact
test
could
apply
and
likened
it
to
title
vii
which
is
not.
it
did
that
because
it
felt
that
title
vi
was
extremely
relevant,
the
test
was
extremely
relevant
to
what
the
test
for
esaa
eligibility
is.
this
is
a
desegregation
case.
even
under
the
jackson
decision
of
the
circuit,
we
would
fall
within
the
intent
test
that
they
have
indicated.
the
appropriate
test
we
say
for
finding
discriminatory
intent
was
set
out
in
the
arlington
heights
case.
hew
relied
on
two
elements.
they
used
a
foreseeability
test,
citing
to
the
hart
case
in
the
second
circuit,
and
on
swann
they
relied,
some
language
in
swann.
as
this
court
has
recently
held
in
the
feeney
case
and
in
columbus
board
of
education,
foreseeability
is
one
element
in
establishing
intent.
it
is
not
in
and
of
itself
sufficient
to
establish
intent.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
note
that
even
the
circuit,
the
second
circuit
in
the
jackson
case
has
some
doubts
about
the
viability
of
the
hart
case
that
it
relied
on.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
swann
case
relied
on
by
hew
in
its
finding
of
ineligibility
for
the
board
of
education
cites
this
language
"disparate
racial
composition
of
staff
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
equal
protection
of
violation."
well,
i
would
say
that
is
somewhat
disingenuous
to
us
that
clause
because
in
swann
you
have
a
situation
where
you
had
de
jure
segregation
and,
yes,
once
you
had
a
prior
finding
of
de
jure
segregation,
then
you
could
use
such
a
test
to
perhaps
imply
intent
at
a
later
time.
keyes
makes
that
eminently
clear.
in
new
york
city
we
had
no
finding
of
intentional
discrimination.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
have
an
understanding
of
the
esaa
statute,
that
esaa
was
intended
to
make
money
available
to
districts
that
were
experiencing
de
facto
segregation.
what
else
would
it
be
for?
it
was
to
assist
in
doing
that,
in
eliminating
de
facto
segregation.
hew
argues
in
their
brief
that
the
solution
adopted
in
esaa
was
to
employ
the
carrot
approach
to
encourage
the
voluntary
elimination,
reduction
or
prevention
of
minority
group
isolation.
they
then
continue
"it
seems
evident
that
with
such
a
starting
point,
it
would
make
no
sense
to
grant
funds
to
school
districts
that,
although
not
violating
the
constitution,
were
maintaining
a
segregated
system."
the
logic
is
incredible
to
me.
that
is
what
this
is
all
about.
i
thought
the
money
was
to
be
made
available
to
districts
that
had
de
facto
segregation.
that
is
what
the
intent
is
all
about.
they
would
deny
it
to
the
very
districts
that
have
the
type
of
segregation
that
this
money
is
intended
to
work
on.
we
have
an
extensive
program
in
new
york.
we
are
ready
to
go
ahead
with
that
program.
hew
has
taken
a
course
that
we
are
not
eligible
here,
we
are
not
eligible
under
the
following
year.
i
say
that
what
they
are
doing
is
frustrating
the
legislative
purpose,
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislature.
their
brief
doesn't
deal
with
this.
their
brief
deals
with
virtually
nothing
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history.
it
talks
a
bit
about
1602,
it
cites
no
cases
except
for
the
aspira
case,
and
i
think
they
think
that
--
if
in
fact
they
think
it
is
all
right
and
they
want
to
interpret
the
legislative
intent
their
way,
that
is
sufficient.
i
think
they
have
to
look
a
little
more
closely
to
what
congress
intended.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
1602(b)
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
right.
that
is
the
stennis
amendment.
that
is
part
of
--
we
have
an
argument
in
our
brief
about
this
stennis
amendment.
senator
stennis
put
an
amendment
on
the
floor
of
congress
which
was
later
adopted
and
became
section
1602(a)
and
1602(b).
what
senator
stennis
was
attempting
to
do
was
to
make
a
police
statement
to
perhaps
the
nation,
to
perhaps
the
congress,
perhaps
this
court.
he
wanted
to
see
something
done
about
de
facto
segregation.
he
was
saying
essentially
that
the
south
was
being
burdened.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
don't
think
it
was
saying
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
understand
that.
but
what
he
was
saying
was
this
is
simply
a
policy
statement.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
from
his
own
language
--
he
said
why
should
not
congress
light
one
little
lamp
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
i
think
it
is
no
more
than
a
policy
statement
and
i
don't
believe
it
had
any
other
action-ability.
i
don't
believe
that
congress
intended
it
to
do
anything
other
than
--
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
get
that
and
you
get
it
very
clear
from
the
discussions
of
senator
javits.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
yes,
and
i
say
that
that
portion
of
the
esaa
statute
is
no
more
than
a
policy
statement,
as
is
section
1602(a).
if
1602(a)
means
anything,
it
means
to
broaden
esaa
eligibility.
in
the
end,
i
would
ask
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
oh,
yes
--
actually
the
other
way,
i
would
say,
clearly
for
de
jure
but
certainly
to
broaden
it
to
do
something
about
de
facto
segregation.
i
think
that
was
the
clear
intent
of
congress.
i
don't
think
there
could
have
been
any
other
intent.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
well,
senator
stennis'
remarks
are
very
clear.
he
was
attempting
to
light
one
little
candle.
he
wanted
to
go
on
record
--
to
be
honest,
i
think
he
wanted
to
go
on
record
in
an
enactment
of
congress
to
say
something
about
doing
something
about
de
facto
segregation.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
you
see,
when
he
initially
submitted
the
stennis
amendment,
he
included
esaa,
title
vi
and
section
182
together.
i
think
he
was
attempting
to
sensitize
the
congress
and
the
nation
and
i
would
say
this
court
to
do
something
in
the
future
about
de
facto
segregation.
i
think
he
was
clearly
just
attempting
to
make
a
policy
statement.
i
do
not
know
what
else
he
could
have
been
attempting
to
do.
i
think
he
may
also
have
been
trying
to
frustrate
--
the
way
he
presented
it,
i
think
he
was
trying
to
frustrate
the
use
of
title
vi
because
he
realized
what
the
law
was
and
he
was
attempting
to
put
title
vi
in
the
same
box
with
esaa.
esaa
could
he
used
against
de
facto
and
de
jure
segregation,
but
the
way
he
presented
it,
it
included
esaa,
title
vi
and
section
182
altogether.
they
used
the
same
language.
congress
in
the
conference
committee
broke
that
out
--
i
think
they
broke
it
out
because
clearly
esaa
could
be
used
against
de
facto
and
de
jure,
but
title
vi
could
not.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
just
three
or
four
points.
it
is
our
position
in
considering
the
solicitor's
construction
of
section
1605(d)(1)(b)
that
we
look
at
the
congressional
history
and
we
look
specifically
at
senate
report
92-61
which
provides
us
with
great
insight
into
what
congress
intended.
again,
the
solicitor
in
discussing
why
or
perhaps
why
congress
would
have
a
different
standard
for
demotions
and
dismissals
as
opposed
to
assignment
of
staff,
the
solicitor
ignores
the
clear
legislative
history
stated
in
92-61
and
by
senator
mondale,
which
i
read
yesterday,
which
it
makes
it
very
clear
this
is
a
particular
concern
they
had
that
the
motion
in
conjunction
with
desegregation
orders.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
waiver,
the
waiver
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
because
we
contend
we
are
eligible
unless
they
find
intentional
discrimination.
i
will
also
note
that
they
withhold
waiver
unfairly,
and
i
will
just
--
the
esaa
2
case,
the
case
that
is
pending
on
this
issue,
it's
in
the
second
circuit
and
is
awaiting
decision.
mr.
joseph
f.
bruno
let
me
tell
you
how
they
construe
it.
we
--
and
the
esaa
2
case
deals
with
next
year's
funding
which
we
were
also
held
to
be
ineligible
for
--
the
position
of
hew
is
--
we
negotiated
an
agreement
with
hew,
a
memorandum
of
understanding
which
was
the
subject
of
the
cawfield
case
that
general
mccree
indicated
which
was
upheld.
we
negotiated
that
agreement,
that
is
a
phased
program
that
will
take
several
years
to
implement
the
changes
that
hew
would
like
us
to
implement,
and
we
have
agreed
to
that.
however,
they
withhold
funding
to
us
under
the
esaa
statute,
under
the
waiver
because
they
contend
that
a
waiver
is
not
available
to
you
until
you
have
eliminated
all
of
these
defects,
not
that
you
have
reached
agreement
and
you
are
eliminating
them,
until
you
have
reached
that
elimination.
so
we
are
now
out
of
esaa
funding
under
their
eligibility
and
under
their
waiver
for
several
years
down
the
road
until
we
have
concluded
this
agreement
which
they
have
approved
with
us.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
note
that
the
key
word
is
discrimination
in
subdivision
(d),
it
is
the
key
word
in
subdivision
(b).
both
subdivision
(d),
hew
concedes,
is
an
intent
test.
we
argue
that
it
is
an
intent
test
in
subdivision
(b).
the
language
around
discrimination,
we
contend,
is
simply
in
one
way
it
is
used
engaged
in
discrimination,
another
it
is
in
order
to
avoid
participation
so
as
to
discriminate.
that
is
clarification
language,
we
believe,
of
congress,
maybe
somewhat
unartfully
drawn,
but
the
word
"discrimination"
having
very
definite
meaning,
and
congress
said
so
during
the
debates.
thank
you
very
much.
