justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
basic
question
about
the
statute
so
i
can
have
it
a
little,
a
little
better
understanding
of
the
whole
scheme.
literally
it
seems
to
provide
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
any
one
of
these
subparagraphs,
the
educational
agency
shall
never
be
eligible
for
assistance.
it
says,
"no
educational
agency
shall
be
eligible
for
assistance
under
this
chapter
if
it
has
after
the
set
date
engaged
in
any
of
these
practices"
--
is
that
the
way
the
agency
reads
it,
or
is
a
school
board
permitted
to
correct
violations
and
then
become
eligible,
even
though
it
was
in
fact
in
violation
for
a
period
after
june
23,
19--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
basis
for
a
waiver
is
that
the
situation
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
the
case
before
us,
we've
had
a
stay
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
for
some
years
on
the
disbursement
of
the
funds
that
they're
trying
to
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whatever.
but
if
in
the
years
that
have
gone
by
since
this
case
started
they
had
corrected
the
situation
in
the
teacher
assignments,
then
presumably
they
could
become
eligible
in
the
future,
is
that
right?
so
they
may
still
get
their
money,
even
if
they
lose
this
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
can
get
money
under
this
program
for
more
than
one
thing,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
might
be
using
some
of
it
for
--
discriminatorily,
and
another
part
of
it
not?
if
you
had
several
programs
going,
some
of
it
might
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
find
that
certain
money
is
being
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
they
cut
it
off,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
cut
off
any
other
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean,
what
if
federal
money
is
being
used
for
two
or
three
different
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
school
board,
then,
is
completely
ineligible
for
any
funds;
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
you
don't
suggest
that
it
has
to
be
to
be
in
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
it
is
in
violation
of
this
statute
in
a
certain
way,
in
using
certain
funds,
but
it's
getting
other
funds
for
other
programs
under
this
same
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under
this
statute
--
would
all
funds
under
this
statute
have
to
cease
if
a
certain
use
of
some
of
the
funds
is
in
a
discriminatory
manner?
