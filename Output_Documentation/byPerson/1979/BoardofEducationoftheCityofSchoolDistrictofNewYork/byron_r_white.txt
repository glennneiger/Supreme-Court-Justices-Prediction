that
this
statute
incorporates
the
constitutional
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do,
but
what
if
we
agreed
with
him?
what
if
we
agreed
with
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
then
also
--
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
what
if
we
agreed
with
you,
is
there
any
claim
in
this
case
that
as
construed
to
cover
merely
impact,
this
particular
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
statute
rest
on
the
spending
power
or
does
it
--
is
it
commerce
or
fourteenth
amendment
or
does
anybody
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
did
it
is
running
against
the

and
then
you
may
have
a
little
problem
on
it.
