justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
is
1605(d)(1)(b),
the
statute
you
question,
does
that
involve
the
proposal
submitted
for
funds
or
does
it
involve
the
practice,
the
existing
practices
of
the
school
board
submitting
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
wouldn't
contend,
would
you,
that
the
rulemaking
authority
of
the
agency
charged
with
carrying
out
the
act
is
necessarily
bound
to
follow
the
committee
reports
of
one
of
the
houses
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reasoning
of
your
last
argument,
as
i
understood
it,
was
your
reliance
on
the
senate
committee
report.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
doubt
that
it
is
a
factor,
but
i
got
the
impression
that
you
were
saying
that
the
agency
charged
with
making
the
rule
can
never
go
against
the
language
in
a
committee
report.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
to
broaden
esaa
eligibility,
you
mean
to
broaden
it
not
only
to
cases
where
there
was
de
facto
segregation
but
where
there
was
de
jure
segregation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
would
senator
stennis
be
putting
it
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
think
that
a
senator
coming
from
a
state
where
there
had
been
a
history
of
segregation
by
law
and
clearly
de
jure
segregation
would
be
urging
that
schools
guilty
of
de
jure
segregation
be
eligible
for
this
aid,
not
only
schools
just
guilty
of
de
facto
segregation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
your
hypothesis
that
congress
is
not
directing
the
state
or
the
school
to
have
foreign
language
instruction,
it
is
simply
offering
financial
aid
if
the
state
chooses
to
have
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
would
you
say
that
the
word
"discriminate"
means
treat
differently?
