justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
petition
is
designed
to
get
somebody
else
other
than
those
35
to
do
something
about
the
lousy
food.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
capable
are
judges
deciding
that
as
opposed
to
base
commanders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
more
neutral,
certainly
but
as
a
factual
matter
how
capable
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
there
is
a
tendency
in
a
case
like
that
for
the
military
complement
on
the
ship
to
be
less
willing
to
obey
orders
if
they
just
had
a
petition
circulated
to
them
saying
let's
cut
out
this
business
of
sailing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
petition
had
simply
been
not
to
congress
but
to
other
servicemen
into
the
base
or
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
ship
saying,
we
think
it
is
a
terrible
idea
to
sail
tonight
and
we
want
you
to
call
the
thing
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
participate
in
the
maneuver
which
had
been
ordered.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how?
by
trial
after
it
was
circulated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
if
the
military
mission
would
still
be
interfered
with.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
just
said
that
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
punish
after
the
petition
is
circulated
and
you
conceded
that
that
is
all
that
can
be
done,
as
i
understand,
even
with
an
inflammatory
petition
that
could
impair
the
willingness
to
obey
orders.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
be
better
assurance
of
the
security
of
the
nation
in
its
performance
to
require
advance
clearance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
is
kind
of
an
outlet
for
throwing
monkey
wrenches
into
the
machinery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
one
really
doubts
that
orderly
expression
serves
those
purposes
in
a
public
place
by
civilians.
the
question
is
much
narrower
than
that
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
judge
peckham
know
about
an
aircraft
carrier?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
he
know
as
much
as
a
commanding
officer
of
an
aircraft
carrier?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
judge
peckham
knows
a
little
bit
more
about
constitutional
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
and
i
certainly
agree
with
my
brother
stewart
that
judge
peckham
undoubtedly
knows
more
about
constitutional
law
than
the
commanding
officer
of
the
ship
and
i
take
it
that
my
brother
stewart
probably
agrees
with
me
that
the
commanding
officer
of
the
ship
knows
more
about
the
ship
than
judge
peckham
does.
isn't
this
basically
a
factual
inquiry
where
would
petitioning
be
appropriate
on
this
particular
ship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
judge
orrick
decide
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
orrick
i
think
does
know
something
about
the
navy,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cobin,
do
you
think
there
is
a
material
distinction
between
circulating
a
petition
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
orally
soliciting
support
for
a
position
and
suggesting
that
others
write
letters
in
a
form
that
you
hand
out
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
is
there
any
doubt
in
mind
--
i
am
reminded
simply
because
of
the
play
julius
caesar
was
on
television
i
think
sunday
night
and
first
brutus
speaks
to
the
crowd
and
the
crowd
is
very
sympathetic
to
brutus
in
justifying
his
slaying
of
caesar.
and
then
mark
anthony
speaks
and
completely
turns
the
crowd
around.
is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
large
groups
of
people
confined
in
close
quarters
can
have
their
moods
altered
rather
quickly
by
communications?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
enlisted
man
is
much
more
in
fear
of
the
top
sergeant
than
he
is
of
the
commander.
take
it
from
one
who
served
as
an
enlisted
man.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
regulation
on
page
3-a
of
the
government's
petition
says
members
of
the
air
force.
now,
certainly
that
includes
base
commanders
as
well
as
privates,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
base
commander
the
chief
executive
officer
and
all
the
privates
and
sergeants
all
within
the
definition
of
the
words
"members
of
the
air
force"
as
used
in
that
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
