justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
challenge
the
right
of
the
particular
respondent
in
this
case
to
make
the
petitioning
that
he
did
do?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
challenge
his
right
to
be
reinstated?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wonder
if
that
is
universally
true.
here
you
had
a
petition
with
eight
people
and
my
example
was
35.
you
are
drawing
a
constitutional
distinction
now.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
terms
of
potential
disruption
to
discipline?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
only
difference
is
that
one
is
more
effective
than
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
maybe
the
right
test
should
be
based
on
the
content
of
the
communication
rather
than
the
form
in
which
the
time,
place
and
manner
kind
of
--
which
the
appeal
takes?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
for
example
a
petition
by
say
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
who
happens
to
be
in
the
navy
saying
that
no
white
should
serve
under
black
officers,
or
something
like
that,
might
be
disruptive?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cobin,
you
have
talked
about
several
decisions,
particularly
parker
v.
levy.
i
don't
know
that
you
have
mentioned
the
case
upon
which
the
government
primarily
relies,
greer
v.
spock,
have
you,
which
did
involve
of
course
a
prior
restraint?
justice
potter
stewart
does
he
have
the
same
right
to
circulate
petitions
an
enlisted
man
would
have?
justice
potter
stewart
the
gentleman
could
have
circulated
petitions
saying,
"please
nominate
me
for
president."
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he
wants
to
be
president.
can
you
understand
my
example?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
part
of
the
difficulty
with
this
case.
i
mean,
what
are
the
implications
of
giving
a
constitutional
protection
to
the
right
to
circulate
petitions?
i
suppose
you
may
give
the
military
leader
the
same
right
and
it
may
give
him
a
political
weapon
of
some
consequence.
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
brennan
in
dissenting
in
greer
v.
spock
said
there
is
no
longer
room
under
any
circumstance
for
the
unapproved
exercise
of
public
expression
on
a
military
base.
if
he
is
right
in
so
characterizing
the
decision
in
greer
v.
spock,
i
guess
you
lose,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
wrote
it
literally,
i
suppose.
that
is
what
he
understood
the
decision
in
greer
v.
spock,
so
he
said,
there
is
no
longer
room
under
any
circumstance
for
the
unapproved
exercise
of
public
expression
on
a
military
base.
that
is
the
way
he
described
the
decision
in
greer
v.
spock.
