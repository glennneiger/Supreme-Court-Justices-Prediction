chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
hear
arguments
next
in
brown
againts
glines.
mr.
jones,
you
may
roceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
isn't
an
order
outstanding
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
these
regulations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
distribution
was
on
the
base.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
violation
of
the
statutes
--
the
provision
of
the
air
force.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
question
remaining
is
whether
that
violates
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
gave
this
appraisal
of
the
quality
of
the
food
to
an
entire
platoon;
is
that
a
private
communication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
a
private
communication,
you
meant
a
couple
of
g.i.'s
grousing
in
the
barracks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
cobin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
congress
really
make
a
declaration
--
if
i
understood
your
language
correctly
--
that
these
episodes
lead
to
or
--
or
that
on
the
basis
they
have
a
tendency
to
lead
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
didn't
say
that
every
action
in
violation
of
this
statute
leads
to
breakdown
in
morale
and
loyalty
in
a
military
organization.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
regulation
that
separates.
when
congress
acted
after
congressman
byrnes
introduced
this
provision
and
what
he
said
in
both
the
introduction
and
chairman
of
the
military
affairs
committee
carl
vinson
said,
was
this
was
intended
to
make
sure
that
every
service
person
could
sit
down
with
his
pencil
and
write
a
letter
to
his
congressman.
now,
the
congress
was
saying
there
that
they
were
preserving
that
right;
congress
didn't
think
that
was
going
to
bring
any
breakdown.
but
the
regulations
are
cast
in
terms
of
the
general
tendency
and
propensity
of
public
activities,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
quite
different
from
sitting
down
with
your
pencil.
as
congressman
carl
vinson
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
need
a
petition
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
they
have
got
to
do
is
ask
for
leave
to
speak
to
the
commanding
officer,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
this
as
someone
suggested,
perhaps
in
briefs
or
argument
that
preceded,
that
this
is
a
matter
of
line
drawing
and
this
court
has
said
and
many
courts
have
said
whenever
you
draw
the
line
you
can
always
have
a
hypothetical
case
which
is
on
one
side
of
the
line
when
it
really
ought
to
be
on
the
other.
that
works
both
ways.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
are
against
prior
restraint,
then
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
how
inflammatory
an
utterance
was.
that
is
the
only
test.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
greer
v.
spock
was
argued,
and
i
think
the
briefs
reflect
that
during
the
civil
war
--
toward
the
end
of
the
civil
war
when
an
election
was
coming
up
there
was
great
activity
on
the
part
of
officers
and
others
--
junior
officers
--
lining
up
votes
for
mr.
lincoln.
now,
do
you
think
that
is
less
a
problem
when
a
member
of
the
military
personnel
does
it
than
when
a
stranger
from
off
the
base
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
leaves,
then
that
is
prior
restraint,
isn't
it,
if
he
forces
the
civilian
to
leave?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
colonels
and
majors
and
captains
that
were
lining
up
votes
for
president
lincoln
among
the
union
soldiers
were
certainly
more
effective
than
dr.
spock
coming
on
the
base,
wouldn't
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
top
sergeants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
wouldn't
be
effective
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
rights
are
based
on
rank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
mr.
cobin,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left,
i
understand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
jones?
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
on
behalf
of
mr.
justice
powell
who
is
unavoidably
absent
today,
an
opinion
written
and
signed
by
him
in
78-1006,
brown,
the
secretary
of
defense
against
glines.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
this
case.
