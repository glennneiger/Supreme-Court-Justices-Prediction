mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
three
years
ago
when
greer
v.
spock
this
court
upheld
an
army
regulation
that
required
the
approval
of
the
base
commander
before
written
materials
could
be
distributed
on
base.
the
court
held
that
the
regulation
was
facially
valid
and
valid
as
applied
to
the
distribution
of
political
leaflets
by
civilians
on
base.
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
essentially
identical
air
force
regulations
are
invalid
when
applied
to
the
distribution
of
petitions
by
servicemen
upon
base.
the
case
arose
in
1974
when
respondent
was
on
active
duty
in
the
air
force
reserves.
he
prepared
petitions
addressed
to
members
of
congress
and
to
the
secretary
of
defense
opposing
military
hair
length
standards.
he
was
informed
by
a
military
attorney
at
travis
air
force
base
in
california
where
he
was
stationed
that
on
base
distribution
of
petitions
required
prior
approval
but
the
off
base
distribution
did
not.
respondent
decided
simply
to
distribute
the
petitions
off
base
in
locations
near
the
base.
but
one
week
later
he
took
a
training
plane
to
guam
and
while
he
was
at
the
base
in
guam
he
distributed
copies
of
his
petitions
to
personnel
at
the
guam
air
force
base
without
seeking
command
approval.
because
of
this
violation
of
the
regulation
he
was
transferred
by
the
air
force
from
active
to
inactive
reserve
status.
respondent
then
brought
this
suit
and
the
courts
below
declared
the
air
force
regulations
to
be
invalid
and
ordered
respondent's
reinstatement
to
active
duty.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
regulations
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
distribution
of
petitions
in
general
and
are
also
invalid
under
10
u.s.c.
1034
as
applied
to
petitions
to
members
of
congress.
we
seek
reversal
of
these
two
rulings
and
i
will
address
the
constitutional
issue
first.
the
district
court
in
this
case
entered
declaratory
relief.
we
haven't
sought
a
stay
of
that.
they
also
ordered
reinstatement
but
that
judgment
presumably
is
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
review
in
this
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
precisely
in
this
case.
in
the
case
that
follows,
huff
v.
secretary
of
the
navy,
there
is
an
injunction.
in
this
case
what
the
court
of
appeals
enjoined
the
navy
from
doing
was
when
respondent
is
returned
to
active
duty
the
navy
cannot
--
i
don't
mean
the
navy
--
the
air
force
cannot
apply
its
regulations
to
restrain
distribution
of
the
particular
petition
to
restrain
distribution
of
the
particular
petition
that
was
involved
in
this
incident.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
we
don't.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
haven't
sought
review
of
that
issue.
if
we
are
correct
that
the
regulations
are
lawful,
then
he
would
not
be
reinstated.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
based
upon
the
theory
that
the
regulations
were
unlawful.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
that
is
the
other
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
this
case
he
directly
violated
the
prior
approval
requirement
by
distributing
without
seeking
approval.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was
on
the
base.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
it
was.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
or
u.s.c.
1034.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
that
captain
glines
violated
the
regulation
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
affidavit
that
was
filed
by
the
serviceman
in
connection
with
the
complaint,
attached
to
the
complaint
you
will
see
that
what
he
said
happened
is
that
captain
glines
approached
him
in
a
service
bay
area,
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
petition
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
gave
sergeant
wolf
a
copy
of
the
petition,
told
him
he
ought
to
sign
it
and
get
other
people
to
sign
it
and
after
it
is
signed
to
send
it
to
an
address
in
california.
there
hasn't
been
any
dispute
that
if
the
regulations
are
lawful
he
violated
the
regulations.
he
may
have
been
in
dispute
at
the
complaint
stage
but
it
is
not
in
dispute
at
this
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
reasons
come
very
close
together
and
i
think
that
that
will
be
more
evident
as
i
get
into
my
argument.
the
regulations
in
this
case
concern
only
the
public
solicitation
of
signatures
and
the
distribution
of
petitions
on
military
bases.
under
these
regulations
any
servicemen
they
privately
solicit
and
may
distribute
petitions
off
base
as
respondent
glines
did
in
this
case
without
seeking
or
requiring
or
needing
command
approval.
but
when
solicitation
or
distribution
occurs
on
base
the
approval
of
the
base
commander
must
be
sought
and
here
as
in
greer
v.
spock
the
commander
must
approve
on
base
distribution
unless
it
would
clearly
endanger
military
discipline,
loyalty
or
morale
or
materially
interfere
with
a
military
mission.
now,
we
submit
that
the
regulations
challenged
in
this
case
are
constitutional
for
the
same
reasons
stated
by
the
court
in
greer
v.
spock.
the
court
held
in
greer
that
military
bases
such
as
the
guam
air
base
and
travis
air
base
are
not
public
forums,
that
is
unlike
parks
and
city
streets,
military
bases
should
not
traditionally
serve
as
places
for
public
assembly
and
expression.
their
traditional
function,
as
the
court
stated
in
greer
is
to
train
soldiers
to
fight
or
to
be
prepared
to
fight
and
not
to
provide
a
forum
for
public
speech
activities.
because
of
this,
as
the
court
held
in
greer,
there
is
no
historical
or
constitutional
basis
for
right
of
access
or
use
of
military
bases
for
public
speech
purposes.
and
military
regulations
that
conditionally
authorize
public
solicitation
and
distribution
of
petitions
on
bases
thus
do
not
entrench
upon,
abridge
or
deny
any
preexisting
constitutional
right.
to
the
contrary,
they
establish
a
conditional
regulatory
right
that
previously
did
not
exist
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
the
court
rejected
in
greer
without
comment
the
claim
that
the
regulations
are
an
over-broad
or
a
prior
restraint
on
speech.
the
regulation's
don't
interfere
with
preexisting
right.
as
the
court
indicated
in
the
lehman
case,
when
a
non-public
forum
is
opened
on
a
conditional
basis
for
public
speech,
it
is
the
equal
protection
clause
that
determines
whether
the
conditions
of
access
or
use
are
constitutional.
and
here
as
in
lehman,
it
isn't
arbitrary,
capricious
or
invidious
for
the
military
to
choose
to
authorize
on
base
petitioning
activities.
only
when
they
do
not
clearly
endanger
military
loyalty,
discipline
and
morale
and
will
not
materially
interfere
with
assigned
military
missions.
the
limitation,
to
use
the
court's
language
in
the
police
department
v.
mosley
is
tailed
to
serve
a
substantial
government
interest.
it
focuses
precisely
on
the
abuse
to
be
controlled.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
this
case
was
distinct
from
greer
because
this
case
involves
servicemen
who
want
to
exercise
speech
rights
on
military
bases,
while
greer
concerns
civilians.
but
for
servicemen,
as
for
civilians,
military
bases
have
not
served
traditionally
as
forums
for
public
expression
and
certainly
not
as
forums
for
the
distribution
of
leaflets
and
petitions.
these
and
other
forms
of
on
base
public
expressive
activities
such
as
demonstrations
and
picketing
have
always
been
subject
to
command
approval
and
indeed
are
subject
to
similar
regulatory
restrictions
as
those
involved
in
this
case.
the
fact
that
servicemen
rather
than
civilians
are
involved
in
this
case
supports
the
regulation.
the
military's
authority
over
the
speech
and
conduct
of
servicemen
is
necessarily
far
broader
than
its
authority
over
similar
conduct
by
civilians
on
military
bases.
for
one
thing,
servicemen
are
government
employees
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
government
may
reasonably
limit
speech
and
various
forms
of
political
activity
by
its
employees
when
necessary
to
achieve
effective
government.
and,
in
particular,
in
the
context
of
soldiers
the
court
has
held
in
parker
v.
levy
that
military
may
properly
prohibit
speech
by
servicemen
that
undermines
discipline
and
order.
it
would
be
incongruous
to
conclude
that
servicemen
have
a
greater
right
of
public
expression
on
military
bases
than
do
civilians.
the
court
was
of
course
aware
in
greer
v.
spock
that
servicemen
were
subject
to
the
army
regulation
as
well
as
civilians
and
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
this
case
from
greer
on
the
ground
that
servicemen
as
well
as
civilians
are
involved
here.
well,
even
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
and
even
if
greer
is
wrong,
that
military
bases
should
be
or
are
open
to
public
speech
activities,
the
challenge
regulations
would
not
be
unconstitutional
even
under
the
principles
applicable
to
public
forums.
the
substantive
goal
advanced
by
the
regulations
is
undeniably
of
great
importance.
the
prohibition
of
on
base
distributions
that
clearly
endanger
effective
military
performance
is
obviously
related
to
a
fundamental
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
our
submission
is
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
create
a
right
of
use
of
public
speech
on
military
bases.
now,
the
private
speech
of
servicemen
would
be
subject
to
regulation
under
the
parker
v.
levy
standard.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
private
individual
communications
between
servicemen
would
certainly
we
think
be
constitutionally
protected
except
to
the
extent
that
parker
v.
levy
allowed
the
military
a
broader
scope
to
regulate
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it
would
be;
yes.
even
in
a
civilian
context
the
government
could
refuse
any
use
of
a
public
facility
that
would
create
a
clear
danger
of
disorder
and
the
regulation
is
quite
narrow
in
its
effect.
servicemen
are
free
to
discuss
political
ideas
both
on
and
off
bases.
they
are
free
to
petition
as
individuals
while
they
are
on
bases;
when
they
are
off
duty
under
current
military
procedures
they
can
leave,
they
don't
need
a
pass;
like
civilians,
they
can
go
off
the
base
and
engage
in
public
petitioning
activities.
as
mr.
justice
powell
stated
in
his
concurrence
in
greer,
in
view
of
the
availability
of
those
other
avenues
of
expression
the
military
prior
approval
requirement
is
justified
in
this
narrow
context
by
the
unique
need
of
the
military
to
insist
upon
a
respect
for
duty
and
discipline
that
has
no
counterpart
in
civilian
life.
we
think
this
need
is
equally
important
at
the
advance
strategic
air
base
in
guam
where
this
case
arose
and
at
the
combat
ready
marine
facility
in
japan
where
the
secretary
of
the
navy
v.
huff
arose
as
at
the
basic
training
facility
in
new
jersey
involving
greer
v.
spock.
the
regulations
are
thus
constitutional
even
if
military
bases
were
a
public
forum.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
air
force
regulations
are
invalid
as
applied
to
petitions
addressed
to
members
of
congress
under
10
u.s.c.
1034.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you
are
referring
just
to
the
second
part
of
our
submission.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
not
sure
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
petition
should
be
prohibited
under
the
regulation.
i
think
that
it
would
almost
certainly
be
allowed
for
distribution.
so
under
the
second
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you
are
referring
to
what
is
the
inherent
distinction
then
between
petitioning
and
simply
private
communication
and
the
distinction
is
obviously
we
think
that
the
petition
has
an
immediate
capacity
to
reach
a
far
broader
audience,
to
create
a
far
more
disruptive
effect
within
the
military
and
more
directly
impact
upon
the
military's
interest
in
discipline
and
morale
and
achieving
its
missions.
it
is
a
difference
in
quantity,
if
not
in
quality,
and
i
think
it
is
a
difference
in
both.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
you
did
it,
they
were
all
standing
together
in
a
public
area
of
the
base,
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
public
communication.
it
would
be
hard
to
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
be
a
typical
example
of
that.
captain
levy's
statements
in
parker
v.
levy,
were
made
in
a
private
context.
he
spoke
to
several
troops
but
i
don't
think
that
he
massed
people
together
and
was
attempting
to
have
a
demonstration.
if
he
had
done
that
it
would
have
been
easily
sanctionable
under
some
other
provision
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
problem
in
parker
was
that
he
did
speak
privately
in
a
manner
that
was
sanctionable
under
the
constitution.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
our
distinction
is
a
practical
one.
as
a
practical
matter
--
i
mean
i
think
you
are
talking
about
a
line
drawing
problem
and
i
don't
dispute
that
there
are
going
to
be
occasions
when
private
communications
can
have
just
as
disruptive
effect
on
base
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
petition
is
inherently
public
because
it
is
designed
to
be
sent
somewhere.
well,
the
statement
to
the
35
people
is
also
designed
to
get
them
to
do
something
about
the
lousy
food.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
certainly
one
characteristic
that
makes
the
petition
inherently
more
public.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
right
and
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
those
are
the
distinctions
that
are
involved.
i
do
think
that
it
is
not
easy
on
the
margin
to
know
which
where
the
effect
is
going
to
be
greatest.
but
certainly
in
--
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
regulations
on
their
face
and
as
a
practical
matter
the
regulatory
restriction
of
petitioning
is
response
to
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
certainly
think
the
petitioning
is
more
disruptive.
as
i
mentioned
before,
if
it
is
designed
to
be
circulated
the
regulation
prohibits
the
distribution
of
petitions.
if
it
is
designed
to
be
distributed
through
the
facility,
then
obviously
it
is
going
to
reach
a
far
broader
audience
than
any
group
of
people
sitting
around
having
lunch
might
talk
about
a
problem.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
military
is
drawing
a
distinction
based
on
the
evil
that
it
has
designed
its
regulation
to
prevent
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
on
an
aggregate
basis
its
distinction
is
defensible.
i
think
that
it
would
be
harder
to
defend
a
regulation
that
simply
said
any
form
of
public
expression
is
subject
to
regulation.
by
focusing
on
petition
they
focused
on
a
concrete
type
of
expression
that
is
traditionally
and
i
think
inherently
public
in
nature.
the
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
--
based
its
ruling
on
concerning
petitions
to
members
of
congress
is
10
u.s.c.
1034.
that
statute
is
brief,
and
i
will
quote
it.
"no
person
may
restrict
any
member
of
an
armed
force
in
communicating
with
a
member
of
congress
unless
the
communication
is
unlawful
or
violates
a
regulation
necessary
to
the
security
of
the
united
states."
well,
from
1951
when
this
statute
was
enacted
until
1978,
the
consistent
administrative
and
judicial
construction
of
the
statute
was
that
it
applies
to
individual
communications
such
as
letters
but
is
inapplicable
to
group
petitioning
activity.
indeed,
in
carlson
v.
schlesinger,
decided
three
years
before
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
court
construed
the
statute
to
apply
only
to
individual
correspondence.
the
language
and
the
history
of
the
statute
support
that
interpretation.
there
is
no
question
whatever
why
this
statute
was
enacted.
in
1951
a
sailor
had
been
threatened
with
a
courts
martial
if
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
congressman
without
sending
it
through
the
navy
chain
of
command
as
navy
regulations
then
required.
congressman
byrnes
learned
of
the
incident
and
canvassed
the
services
and
determined
that
only
the
navy
imposed
such
a
restriction
on
individual
correspondence.
the
air
force
for
example
informed
congressman
byrnes,
and
i
quote."
any

congressman
byrnes
proposed
this
statute
to
make
the
navy's
practice
uniform
with
that
of
the
army
and
the
air
force
by
overturning
the
navy's
restriction
on
individual
communications.
congressmen
byrnes
and

thus
stated
twice
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
what
this
statute
does
is,
and

permit
any
serviceman
to
sit
down
and
take
a

and
write
to
his
congressman

the
sponsors
could
not
have
been
more
clear
in
stating
the
limited
objective
of
this
legislation.
the
court
of
appeals
discarded
the
statements
of
legislative
intent
on
the
theory
that
the
word
"communication"
employed
in
the
statute
necessarily
include
petitions
as
well
as
correspondence.
but
we
don't
dispute
that
any
individual
letter
stating
a
grievance
can
be
characterized
as
a
petition.
but
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
was
the
individual's
private
communications
to
congress,
not
public,
on

group
activity.
nothing
in
the
regulations
in
this
case
interferes
with
any
serviceman's
individual
communications,
however
they
are
described.
the
regulation
encompasses
only
what
the
statute
doesn't
public
activities,
distribution
of
petitions
on
base
rather
than
the
communication
of
the
petition,
the
private
communication,

when
congress
is
legislated
with
respect
to
group
petitioning
activity
in
other
contexts,
it
is
done
so
expressly.

years

this

"congress
had
a
model
if
it
wanted
to
reach
collective
group
petitioning
activities.
but
in
10
u.s.c.
1034,
the
language
is
limited
to
individual
communications
because
the
evil
the
congress
had
before
it
was
interference
with
the
privacy
of
those
communications.
assuming
that
the
statute
applies
to
group
petitioning,
the
challenge
regulations
are
nonetheless
valid
because
they
don't
restrict
the
communication
of
the
petition.
the
kind
of
restriction
that
congress
was
it
enacted
the
statute
was
on
the
communication
itself
on
the
requirement
that
the
navy
then
had
that
private
letters
be
sent
through
the
chain
of
command.
well,
the
regulations
don't
restrict
communications
in
that
sense.
any
letter
or
petition
may
be
sent
to
congress
wholly
without
military
review.
what
the
regulations
restrict
is
the
use
of
military
bases,
ships
and
aircraft
as
forms
for
solicitation
and
distribution.
it
is
the
military's
unwillingness
to
provide
a
forum
for
this
conduct
in
limited
circumstances.
a
restriction
on
the
communication
of
the
petition
to
congress.
it
is
only
if
the
statute
intended
to
impose
affirmative
obligations
on
the
services
to
open
military
facilities
to
conduct
traditionally
prohibited.
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
we
agree
with
judge
tamm
in
his
dissent
in
the
huff
case
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
in
1951
in
the
middle
of
the
korean
war
intended
to
create
a
public
forum
right
for
group
petitioning
activities
on
military
bases.
group
action
as
in
the
distribution
of
petitions
on
military
facilities
is
not
mentioned
even
briefly
in
the
legislative
history.
and
because
the
regulations
don't
restrict
communications
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
they
are
not
invalid
under
10
u.s.c.
1034.
there
are
additional
points
to
be
made
on
this
issue.
the
next
case
to
be
argued
also
raises
the
statutory
issue.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
in
this
case.
