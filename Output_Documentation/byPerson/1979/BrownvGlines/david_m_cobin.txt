mr.
david
m.
cobin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
does
military
security
require
the
abridgement
of
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
petition
the
government
to
redress
grievances
by
means
of
a
prior
restraining,
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
remedies
known
to
a
jurisprudence?
the
government
has
never
demonstrated
that
it
does,
not
in
the
district
court
and
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
in
this
court.
the
government's
position
is
that
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
circulating
petitions
by
its
nature
somehow
leads
to
a
breakdown
of
military
capacity.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
judges
are
in
many
ways
in
a
better
position
to
decide
on
a
constitutional
basis.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
the
military
commanders
could
separate
themselves
from
their
positions,
desiring
only
that
activities
they
desire
to
take
place
continue,
if
they
do
not
have
the
respect
for
the
right
to
petition
as
the
commanders
involved
in
these
cases
have,
then
they
would
be
in
a
good
position,
your
honor.
but,
they
are
not
able
to
separate
themselves.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
you
mean
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
mr.
chief
justice,
you
used
the
term
"congress."
do
you
mean
the
military
commanders
in
this
case
or
the
secretaries
who
drafted
the
regulations
that
were
enforced?
mr.
david
m.
cobin
they
are
directed
specifically
--
the
air
force
regulation
of
course
is
directed
specifically
at
the
circulation
of
petitions.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
in
terms
of
the
acts
involved
it
is
certainly
different,
but
in
terms
of
the
effect
it
has
on
military
security
i
believe
that
is
not
true.
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
i
believe
contains
several
fundamental
errors.
and
one
of
those
errors
is
that
somehow
petitions
lead
to
grievances
rather
than
grievances
leading
to
petitions.
those
who
circulate
petitions
have
a
grievance
and
the
question
is
whether
the
traditional
means
of
expressing
a
grievance
to
the
government
by
petitioning
including
the
peaceful
circulation
of
petitions
is
an
option.
i
would
like
to
give
an
illustration
which
i
think
at
least
demonstrates
in
these
cases
that
the
right
to
circulate
a
petition
is
a
less
of
a
danger
to
military
security
than
the
abridgement
of
it,
or
it
could
be.
the
uss
hancock
and
the
uss
ranger
in
the
years
1972
and
1973
were
berthed
next
to
each
other
at
alameda
naval
air
station
when
they
were
not
at
sea.
in
fact
the
trial
of
allen
v.
monger
partially
took
place
on
board
the
uss
ranger.
both
ships
contained
military
personnel
who
didn't
want
the
ships
to
go
to
sea.
in
the
case
of
the
uss
hancock,
one
member
of
the
crew
requested
permission
to
circulate
a
petition,
it
was
denied,
he
circulated
it
any
way,
and
he
was
punished
for
it.
five
other
members
of
the
ship
filed
a
suit
asserting
their
right
to
circulate
that
petition.
that
ship
did
sail
and
it
sailed
with
all
five
of
the
servicemen
aboard.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor.
the
petition
in
the
particular
case
was
asking
congress
to
look
into
the
necessity
of
making
a
cruise.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
the
question
is
whether
that
would
have
a
tendency
to
make
the
members
of
the
ship
less
mindful
of
orders?
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
would
suggest
that
the
trained
members
of
the
service
would
not
have
that
tendency.
however,
if
there
were
a
petition
it
is
certainly
possible
for
a
petition
to
be
inflammatory
as
any
statement
could
be
inflammatory,
but
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
would
permit
stopping
of
that
petition
if
it
had
such
a
tendency
in
the
punishment
of
the
petitioner
without
the
regulations
that
are
challenged
here.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
trial
after
the
initiation
of
circulation.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true.
this
court
in
parker
v.
levy
and
in
middendorf
v.
henry
insured
the
power,
the
ability
of
a
military
commander
to
bring
--
to
swiftly
control
any
disturbance.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
article
134
authorizes
punishment
and
i
am
quoting,
of
"all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline."
i
do
not
believe
that
an
extensive
circulation
would
be
required
for
a
commanding
officer
to
act
under
that
provision.
at
the
first
sign
of
danger,
that
through
the
authority
given
commanders
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
by
means
of
non-judicial
punishment
or
summary
court
martial
with
informal
procedures
or
a
special
or
general
court
martial
with
formal
procedures
that
the
person
causing
the
problem
could
be
punished
and
the
acts
could
be
stopped.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor,
and
that
is
because
the
--
since
grievances
do
not
go
away
the
person
who
would
circulate
a
petition
peacefully
may
choose
some
other
means
of
expressing
the
grievance.
and
the
illustration
that
i
want
to
give
is
on
the
uss
ranger
the
serviceman
who
did
not
want
the
ship
to
leave
didn't
circulate
a
petition
but
dropped
a
wrench
in
the
gears,
and
that
ship
didn't
go
out
for
four
months
and
it
cost
the
government
$800,000
to
repair
the
damage.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
it
is
the
outlet
that
was
selected
by
history
and
by
the
constitution
and
remains
to
be
the
legitimate
outlet
for
the
expression
of
grievances.
the
distinction
that
was
made
by
professor
calvin
in
the
law
review
article
that
was
cited
by
both
the
government's
brief
and
in
my
own.
it
distinguishes
between
three
ways
of
expressing
grievances.
one
professor
calvin
calls
a
revolutionary
act,
and
captain
levy
in
parker
v.
levy
did
such
a
revolutionary
act.
another
is
civil
disobedience.
and
the
third
is
peaceful
protest.
professor
calvin
calls
peaceful
protest
the
purest
exercise
of
first
amendment
freedoms.
and
the
peaceful
circulation
of
a
written
petition
is
the
most
--
is
the
purest
form
of
exercising
peaceful
protest.
referring
to
the
speech
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
quoted
in
my
brief,
i
understood
two
points
relevant
to
this
case
to
be
made
in
that
speech.
one
of
those
points
was
that
orderly
expression
serves
constitutional
goals.
and
the
other
is
that
everyone
must
recognize
that
that
right
of
orderly
expression
belongs
to
all.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
but
mr.
chief
justice,
for
a
serviceman
the
place
where
the
serviceman
lives
and
works
and
does
day
to
day
activities
is
on
a
military
base.
in
the
case
of
allen
v.
monger
for
instance
the
place
where
circulation
was
attempted
was
a
ship.
that
ship
was
at
sea
eight
months
of
the
year.
the
only
place
that
the
expression
of
grievances
could
take
place
during
that
eight
months
is
on
board
a
ship.
for
servicemen
the
ship
is
--
the
public
place
is
on
board
the
ship,
is
the
public
forum.
i
do
not
believe
a
public
forum
must
be
found
to
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
petition.
however,
for
the
serviceman
this
is
the
public
forum.
the
government
has
made
the
distinction
between
public
acts
and
public
speech
and
private
speech.
but
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
indicate
how
circulation
of
petitions
can
very
well
be
a
private
speech
and
how
the
particular
regulation
completely
eliminates
the
ability
to
engage
in
that
speech.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
on
an
overnight
stop-over
in
guam.
he
was
on
guam
only
for
eight
hours,
from
midnight
until
8:00
in
the
morning.
the
ground
crew
came
aboard
the
plane
to
clean
the
plane
and
one
of
them
was
handed
a
copy
of
the
petition.
he
took
it
back
to
his
barracks
and
eight
signed
it.
this
is
the
normal
kind
of
speech
activity
that
the
constitution
was
designed
to
protect.
it
was
done
peacefully,
it
was
done
privately,
it
created
no
disorder
until
the
commanding
officer
reacted
to
the
exercise.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
role
of
commanding
officer
should
not
be
to
restrain
peaceful
petitioning
but
to
encourage
it.
the
respondent
does
not
dispute
the
authority
of
commanding
officers
to
make
appropriate
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
peckham
in
the
lower
court
decision
in
allen
v.
monger
specifically
listed
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
that
would
be
appropriate
for
an
aircraft
carrier.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
well,
judge
peckham
toured
the
uss
ranger
to
assist
him
in
making
that
determination,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor,
i
am
sure
that
he
does
not.
however,
what
judge
peckham
did
conclude
was
that
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
sir,
a
good
deal
more
about
constitutional
law.
and
judge
peckham
concluded
that
there
were
places
on
board
that
ship
that
peaceful
petitioning
without
face
to
face
proselytizing
could
take
place
peacefully
without
disrupting
the
ship.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
the
regulations
would
be
effected
by
the
commanding
officers
of
the
ship.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes.
judge
peckham
decided
the
allen
v.
monger
case
which
is
pending
before
the
court.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
your
honor,
one
of
the
--
the
basic
problem
with
the
regulations
as
urged
by
respondent
is
that
they
enable
a
prior
restraint
to
take
place.
at
each
of
the
times
a
request
has
been
made
to
circulate
a
petition
that
that
restraint
has
been
exercised
and
that
no
circulation
was
allowed
to
take
place.
it
is
not
the
role
of
the
commanding
officer
to
determine
the
bounds
of
the
constitution
and
in
an
individual
case
the
commanding
officer
because
of
his
role
is
bound
to
deny
petitions.
and
in
the
huff
case
which
will
be
argued
this
afternoon
the
government
has
conceded
that
those
denials
were
wrongful.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
circulation
of
a
written
petition
is
more
effective.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
as
a
general
basis,
that
is
true.
i
believe
that
captain
levy's
statements
to
the
troops
under
his
command
before
him
which
was
punished
after
the
fact
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
much
more
disruptive
than
any
of
the
petitions
that
had
been
brought.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
believe
that
the
proper
standard
would
be
a
time,
place
and
manner
--
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
being
allowed
and
the
provisions
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
enable
a
commanding
officer
to
stop
petitioning
and
to
punish
disruption
if
it
occurs.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no
more
than
a
speech
to
the
same
effect,
your
honor.
the
role
of
the
commanding
officer
rather
than
restraining
a
petitioning
--
restraining
a
petitioning
will
not
eliminate
racist
attitudes.
nor
will
it
eliminate
anger
or
belief
in
oppression
or
any
other
kind
of
feeling
that
brings
forth
the
grievance.
if
a
commanding
officer
used
his
authority
to
encourage
peaceful
petitioning,
to
encourage
a
proper
respectful
attitude
towards
the
first
amendment
and
a
recognition
of
the
importance
of
civility,
if
i
may
use
the
word,
for
expression
of
speech,
then
that
would
maximize
-the
ability
of
both
satisfying
the
constitutional
protections
and
protecting
military
security.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
i
have
no
doubt
of
it,
your
honor.
however,
you
will
note
that
that
change
occurred
because
of
oral
expression
and
not
the
circulation
of
a
petition.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
and
also
that
the
limitations
of
the
numbers
of
the
persons
gathering
is
a
part
of
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
and
that
a
commanding
officer
at
the
first
sign
of
that
kind
of
problem
can
stop
it.
if
i
may
refer
you
to
the
case
of
parker
v.
levy
again,
captain
levy
engaged
in
a
number
of
speeches
that
were
highly
prejudicial
to
the
military.
nonetheless,
the
commanding
officer
there
appeared
not
to
have
any
problem
in
taking
care
of
the
matter.
at
first
the
thought
was
to
give
non-judicial
punishment
after
captain
levy
was
cautioned.
later
it
was
determined
that
a
court
martial
was
appropriate.
if
that
case
didn't
cause
problems
to
the
command,
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
petition
that
could
cause
greater
problems.
unlike
the
civilian
life
there
is
an
obligation
of
members
of
the
military
service
to
inform
a
commanding
officer
of
a
danger
to
military
security.
in
addition
to
the
abilities
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
that
would
depend
on
the
grievance,
your
honor.
in
this
case
and
in
all
of
the
cases
that
are
brought
to
federal
courts
the
grievances
have
been
directed
to
members
of
congress
or
in
this
case
also
in
addition
to
the
secretary
of
defense.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
the
line
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
draw
is
a
line
between
a
prior
restraint
and
time,
place
and
manner
regulations
with
a
power
of
punishment.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
permits
the
commanding
officer
to
intervene
whenever
there
appears
to
the
commanding
officer
a
danger
to
military
order.
and
whether
that
be
inflammatory
or
be
through
some
other
kind
of
problem,
the
commanding
officer
can
take
authority
to
prevent
the
disorder
from
occurring.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
have
not.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
respondent's
position
is
that
that
case
obviously
does
not
apply
to
this
case
because
it
involves
--
both
the
speech
interest
involved
and
the
policies
involved
were
entirely
different,
that
that
decision
permitted
a
commanding
officer
to
keep
civilians
off
of
a
military
base.
and
it
is
that
primary
ability
plus
the
policy
of
maintaining
a
neutral
political
--
politically
neutral
military
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
basis
of
that
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
the
right
of
persons
already
on
a
military
base
with
a
right
and
an
obligation
to
be
on
a
military
base
to
engage
in
speech
activities
that
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
think
that
the
problem
of
--
i
believe
that
is
not
so
much
the
problem
that
that
would
be
different
but
the
ability
of
the
commanding
officer
to
take
charge
without
a
prior
restraint
that
is
different.
a
commanding
officer
has
very
limited
authority
over
a
political
candidate
who
is
on
the
base.
the
only
authority
is
to
make
a
candidate
leave
and
perhaps
initiate
civilian
prosecution.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
not
if
the
basis
for
ordering
the
civilian
to
leave
is
the
improper
activities
commenced
on
the
base.
but
the
power
of
a
commanding
officer
over
a
member
under
his
command
is
greater
than
the
authority
of
anyone
else
in
this
country.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
would
hope
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
think
there
may
well
be
other
provisions
that
restrict
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
would
believe
that
you
would
have
the
constitutional
right
to
circulate
a
petition.
if
that
petition
involves
something
that
interfered
with
another
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
understand
the
example,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
all
the
implications
of
it.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
a
specific
limitation
upon
commanding
officers
might
be
appropriate
because
of
a
particular
problem
that
their
circulation
of
petitions
might
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
i
don't
see
that
top
sergeants
circulating
petitions
peacefully,
that
by
their
nature
do
not
cause
a
problem
--
present
any
constitutional
problem
as
suggested
by
the
example.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
no,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
certainly
haven't
thought
out
the
problem
of
a
commanding
officer
seeking
to
be
president
and
using
his
authority
to
do
so
through
the
use
of
a
petition.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
pardon
me?
mr.
david
m.
cobin
only
on
occasion.
the
essential
position
of
respondent
is
that
military
security
is
adequately
and
indeed
better
served
by
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
on
peaceful
petitioning.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
question
of
a
base
commander,
a
general
macarthur
or
base
commander
or
even
a
top
sergeant
circulating
a
petition
that
would
influence
their
election
to
a
political
office.
these
regulations
that
are
challenged
here
are
not
designed
to
deal
with
that
problem.
they
are
not
designed
to
deal
with
command
influence
and
they
do
not
speak
about
such
questions.
but
articles
133
and
134,
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman,
the
general
article,
and
other
laws
that
were
enacted
such
as
the
hatch
act,
are
designed
to
deal
with
that.
and
that
we
are
not
asking
that
this
court
rule
there
are
no
limitations
that
can
be
placed
upon
the
right
to
petition,
only
that
a
prior
restraint
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
the
regulation
says
that
solicitation
of
signatures
shall
not
take
place
on
an
air
force
facility
without
the
approval
of
the
base
commander.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
but
a
base
commander
has
a
commander
himself.
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
commanding
officer
over
a
base
commander
from
taking
charge
and
punishing
or
stopping
an
illegal,
improper
solicitation
of
signatures
by
a
base
commander,
just
as
general
macarthur
was
removed
from
the
army
by
the
chief
executive
of
the
armed
forces,
the
president.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
however,
who
is
chief
executive.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
there
is
the
power
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
by
commanding
officers
to
deal
with
persons
under
their
command
who
prejudice
good
order
and
military
discipline,
or
who
perform
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
not
that
would
be
altered
by
the
decision
of
this
court
as
respondent
requests.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
there
may
be
other
issues
that
were
involved,
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
david
m.
cobin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
it
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
that
would
be
"yes,"
except,
your
honor,
that
that
could
not
be
taken
literally.
mr.
david
m.
cobin
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
definition
of
"public
expression."
