justice
byron
r.
white
i
may
have
the
two
cases
confused,
but
the
government
had
in
effect
conceded
that
the
regulations
were
improperly
applied
to
the
particular
litigants
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
other;
not
this
case.
i
am
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
distribution
as
well
by
sergeant
wolf
as
well
as
captain
glines.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
him,
sergeant
wolf?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again,
his
violation
was
handing
the
piece
of
paper,
not
the
oral
statements;
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
make
the
oral
statements.
if
he
didn't
have
the
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
wanting
people
to
sign
this,
he
could
have
said
to
the
man,
"i
would
like
you
to
draft
a
letter
saying
the
same
thing
my
letter
said"?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
the
reason
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
regulation
or
that
it
is
protected
by
the
constitution
or
the
statute?
which
is
your
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
may
be
dense
here,
but
i
still
am
still
a
little
unclear
on
the
distinction.
say
you
have
got
a
group
of
men
that
are
sitting
around
having
dinner
in
the
barracks
somewhere.
it
is
a
non-work
area,
it
is
not
a
public
speech
or
anything.
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
asking
permission
to
criticize
in
a
loud
voice
at
the
table
what
is
being
served
on
the
one
hand;
and
on
the
other
hand,
supplementing
that
with
a
written
piece
of
paper
saying,
let's
all
sign
and
send
it
to
the
commander?
and
why
is
one
more
disruptive
than
the
other?
that
is
your
distinction,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
word
"private"
is
a
little
misleading
because
both
communications
are
equally
either
private
or
public,
whichever
way
you
characterize
it.
there
are
35
people
there
and
one
time
it
is
totally
orally
and
the
other
time
it
is
supplemented.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
also
the
petition
serves
to
put
in
some
sort
of
distributable
form
the
opinion
of
those
35
people
if
they
all
sign
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
orally
be
able
to
walk
away
and
say
all
35
agreed
with
me
but
if
they
have
signed
a
piece
of
paper,
it
is
something
else
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
understand
petitioning
is
more
likely
to
be
effective
for
the
reasons
that
my
brother
white
identifies.
but
the
question
is,
which
is
more
disruptive
i
suppose;
and
therefore
justifies
prohibition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
prime
reliance
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
read
beatle
bailey?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
read
beatle
bailey?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
depending
upon
the
nature
of
that
alleged
conduct
might
not
they
have
first
amendment
defenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
sure
that
is
right.
you
are
saying
that
the
regulation
is
unconstitutional
as
a
prior
restraint.
say
the
military
redrafted
the
regulation
and
said
commanding
officers
cannot
circulate
any
petitions
without
getting
approval
of
some
committee
or
something
like
that
or
approval
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
wouldn't
the
commanding
officer
there
be
able
to
make
precisely
the
same
constitutional
argument
that
you
are
making
on
behalf
of
a
lower-ranking
military
personnel?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
another
justification
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
would
justify
a
prior
restraint?
