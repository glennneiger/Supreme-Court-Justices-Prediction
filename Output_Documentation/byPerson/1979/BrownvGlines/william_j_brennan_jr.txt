justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
leave
entirely
your
first
submission,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
first
submission
is
that
the
first
amendment
simply
has
no
application
to
military
bases
and
therefore
even
oral
statements
back
and
forth
between
servicemen
may
be
prohibited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
it
is
speech
that
does
not
create
any
clear
and
present
danger
or
interference
of
discipline
or
anything
else,
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected
on
the
base?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
anything
as
in
parker
v.
levy
where
it
is
in
effect
you
might
say
almost
treasonable
or
at
least
advocating
a
course
of
action.
somewhere
you
said
something
you
said,
i
think
we
ought
to
do
something
about
the
lousy
food
here.
you
say
that
that
is
a
constitutionally
protected
comment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again,
before
you
leave
your
second
submission
if
i
may
to
be
sure
i
understand
it,
why
would
you
concede
that
you
can
say
orally
that
the
food
is
lousy
and
we
ought
to
do
something
about
it,
and
disagree
with
the
motion
"let's
all
sign
a
petition
to
the
commanding
officer
asking
him
to
give
better
food"?
why
is
one
more
disruptive
than
the
other
in
terms
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
or
whatever
your
standard
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
does
he
have
to
ask
permission
to
do
something
in
writing
he
need
not
ask
permission
to
do
orally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
necessarily
the
congress
when
it
put
in
those
conditions
required
the
judiciary
to
apply
them,
didn't
they?
--
in
case
of
controversy.
