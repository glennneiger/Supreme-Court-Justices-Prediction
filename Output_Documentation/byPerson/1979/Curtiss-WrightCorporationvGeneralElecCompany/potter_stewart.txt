it's

an

justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
district
court,
as
i
read
its
latter
opinion
on
page
--
the
last
paragraph
of
it
on
page
13
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
your
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
did
say
and
presumably
consider
the
presence
of
the
counterclaim
as
a
factor
weighing
against
certification,
but
he
thought
that
factor
was
overbalanced
by
the
other
factors
weighing
in
favor
of
certification
under
54
(b).
and,
you
would
--
you
would
--
would
you
--
you
would
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
was
correct
in
weighing
that
as
one
of
the
factors.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
he
decided
it
in
your
favor
and
you're
not
going
to
quarrel
with
him
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
question
but
--
that
54
(b)
is
an
exception
to
that
rule
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
breathe
of
that
exception,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
concede
that
54
(b)
is
--
whatever
--
whatever
its
scope
is
an
exception
to
that
rule,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
mine
run
plain-vanilla
case
doesn't
lend
--
lend
itself
to
a
54
(b)
disposition,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ordinary
case
doesn't
--
isn't
amenable
to
the
54
(b).
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
involve
separate
issues.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
comparatively
few
compared
to
most
civil
cases
in
the
federal
district
courts,
there
are
not
many
cases
comparatively,
where
54
(b)
would
be
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
you
earlier
said
everything
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
relative,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

interest.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
your
submission
is
that,
mr.
groner,
that
it's
impermissible
for
a
district
judge
to
consider,
in
any
way,
the
difference
between
the
going
economic
rate
of
interest
and
the
statutory
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
anything
like
that?
