mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
third
circuit
was
in
error
when
it
vacated
the
entry
of
final
judgment
by
the
district
court
pursuant
to
rule
54
(b)
after
it
had
entered
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
curtiss-wright
in
the
amount
of
$19
million.
the
--
this
--
the
third
circuit
based
its
opinion
in
the
main
on
the
existence
of
counterclaims
which
it
said,
presented
a
possibility
of
setoff
and
barred
the
entry
of
the
final
judgments.
this
is
a
classic
example
of
complex
multi-claim
litigation.
there
are
21
contracts
involved.
there
are
16
counts
in
the
curtiss-wright's
complaint
ranging
from
fraud
and
misrepresentation
on
down
the
line.
the
general
electric
counterclaims
allege
extraordinary
assistance
and
an
unjust
enrichment
claim
which
they
base
on
a
fact
that
they
helped
curtiss-wright
which
prevented
curtiss-wright
from
going
into
default
and,
therefore,
general
electric
is
somehow
entitled
to
the
money
that
curtiss-wright
would
have
lost
had
it
been
in
default.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
--
they
are
unliquidated
and,
you
know,
obviously,
the
proofs
are
difficult.
the
amended
complaint
is
the
one
on
which
summary
judgment
has
been
granted
in
this
case,
and
that
dealt
with
the
balances
due
on
the
contracts
for
the
nuclear
components
that
were
delivered
and
accepted
by
general
electric
and
its
customer,
and
are
now
in
use
by
them.
the
basis
for
summary
judgment
is
really
not
at
issue
here.
there
were
no
factual
issues
in
the
summary
judgment
case
and
the
sole
legal
issue
was
the
existence
of
a
release
clause
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
5
(c).
that
clause
was
that
--
the
interpretation
of
it
was
determined
in
favor
of
curtiss-wright
and
the
summary
judgment
was
granted
to
them.
in
the
balance
of
the
case,
that
release
clause
has
no
part.
there
is,
therefore,
no
interrelation,
factually
or
legally,
between
the
claims
on
which
summary
judgment
has
been
granted
and
the
claims
in
the
unadjudicated
claims
in
the
balance
of
the
complaint
or
in
the
counterclaims.
now,
the
appellate
court
really
doesn't
question
the
qualification
for
finality
here.
they'd
have
not
contested
the
district
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
--
no
separate
--
that
there
was
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
here,
that
it
could
be
decided
separately,
that
there
was
no
question
of
mootness
or
delay
or
duplicate
of
appeal
or
any
of
those
things.
they
didn't
deal
with
that
at
all.
they
--
they
said
that
the
presence
of
a
counterclaim
posing
a
possibility
is
--
of
a
setoff
was
a
bar
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment,
absent
harsh
and
unusual
circumstances.
and
they
applied
the
standard
of
harsh
unusual
circumstances
which
is
really
akin
to
--
an
irreparable
harm
standard
because
they
talked
about
insolvency
and
economic
duress.
they
--
they
admit
that
the
result
is
harsh
insofar
as
curtiss-wright
is
concerned,
but
they
--
they
somehow
dismiss
that
injustice
and
say
that
it
has
to
be
almost
an
irreparable
harm,
you
have
to
have
insolvency.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
i
--
i
certainly
agree,
your
honor
that
the
sears
case
--
i
--
i
emphasize
that
the
primary
discretion
was
in
the
district
court.
and
any
matter
in
which
a
--
a
court
has
discretion
is
obviously
always
subject
to
review
by
a
--
by
a
higher
court.
i
think
that
in
the
sears
case,
though,
your
honor,
what
we
had
was
this,
the
court
enunciated
three
things
that
were
important
for
a
--
a
rule
54
(b)
entry
of
judgment.
one
was,
they
said
that
it
had
to
be
a
--
a
single
claim
for
relief.
then,
they
said
that
claim
had
to
be
adjudicated
finally.
and
then
they
directed
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
should
then
see
that
it
was
independent,
factually
and
legally,
from
the
balance
of
the
claims
in
the
suit.
and
that
brings
into
it
the
attendant
questions
of
--
of
mootness,
duplicate
of
appeals,
and
so
forth.
and
on
page
436
and
351
of
the
sears
case,
and
i'll
paraphrase
to
some
extent
and
quote
to
some.
they
said
it
cannot
well
be
argued
that
the
claims
stated
in
--
well,
they
talk
about
the
claims
here,
it
cannot
well
be
argued
that
the
district
court
has
abused
its
discretion
in
certifying
that
there
exist
no
just
reason
for
delay.
and
then,
referring
to
the
claims
in
that
case,
they
said,
“they
certainly
can
be
decided
independently
of
each
other.”
so,
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
--
is
a
final
judgment
and
the
district
court,
exercising
its
discretion
under
rule
54
(b)
to
enter
that
judgment
to
where
there's
no
just
reason
for
delay.
and
the
sears
case
emphasizes
the
broad
discretion
that
the
district
court
has.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
it
focused
on
the
discretion.
this
is
entirely
different
than
manners
involving
appeals
from
interlocutory
orders
because
this
is
not
an
interlocutory
order.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
you
mean
in
--
in
the
present
case?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
i
think
that
insofar
as
the
standards
are
concerned,
we
did,
pursuant
to
sears,
have
a
separate
claim
for
relief
and
that
claim
was
finally
disposed
of.
and
in
--
within
the
framework
of
the
sears
decision,
we
have
a
final
decision
under
--
under
section
1291
of
28
u.s.c.
now,
where
the
court
of
--
where
the
third
circuit
has
gotten
impaled
here,
i
think
is
on
this
question
of
a
counterclaim
because
they
have
not
applied
--
excuse
me,
they
have
not
applied
universally
this
standard
of
harsh
unusual
circumstances
to
cases
where
there
is
no
counterclaim.
but,
where
they
become
impaled
is
where
the
counterclaim.of
course,
the
cold
metal
case
disposes
of
the
matter
of
the
counterclaim
being
a
barrier
because
that
was
decided
right
after
sears
and
said,
“you
could
have
a
counterclaim,
even
a
compulsory
counterclaim.”
the
third
circuit,
in
my
view,
is,
number
one,
treating
it
as
an
interlocutory
order.
and
in
their
allis-chalmers
case
inn
which
they
rely,
they
use
the
specific
words
“interlocutory
order.”
they
say
since
final
certification
of
an
interlocutory
order
should
occur
only
in
the
infrequent
harsh
case.
the
dissent
in
that
case
picked
that
up
and
said
the
majority
has
blurred
the
distinction
between
appeals
from
final
decisions,
disposing
of
separate
claims
and
those
from
interlocutory
orders
on
appeals
of
ninth
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
but
now,
i
want
to
get--
pardon?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
that's
--
that's
interlocut
--
interlocutory,
yes.
they
confused
that,
they
thought
that
54
(b)
was
some
type
of
interlocutory
and
the
district
court
can't
make
final
that
which
is
not
final.
so,
he
can't
certify
under
54
(b)
in
the
first
place,
unless
--
he
can't
enter
that
judgment
unless
it's
--
unless
it's
a
final
judgment.
now,
as
far
as
the
counterclaims
are
concerned,
the
--
the
third
circuit
is
--
is
worried
about
enforcement,
and
that
is
not
a
question
of
finality.
they're
worried
about
who
shall
hold
the
money.
in
their
--
in
their
decision,
they
--
they
said
the
practical
effect
here,
the
practical
thing
that
we're
being
asked
to
decide
is
who
shall
hold
the
money
until
the
case
is
finally
decided.
and
--
and
that
really
is
not
a
rule
54
(b)
--
primarily
a
rule
54
(b)
consideration.
as
early
as
reeves
versus
beardall
which
was
prior
to
the
change
in
the
rule
from
single
transaction
over
to
its
present
state,
this
--
this
court
held
that
the
stay
provisions
of
rule
54
(b)
governed
who
should
hold
the
money.
now,
what's
happened
now
is
that
the
54
(b)
stay
provisions
have
been
split
off
into
62
(h)
which
is
now
where
you
stay
a
54
(b)
judgment.
so
that,
if
you
apply
reeves
versus
beardall,
you
say,
after
the
judgment
has
been
entered,
if
you
want
to
stay
because
you
want
us
to
determine
who
shall
hold
the
money,
then
you
go
under
rule
62
(h).
i
think
the
fact
that
they
--
they
split
that
into
a
separate
rule
may
well
have
been
to
avoid
having
the
confusion
of
the
processes
under
the
stay
provisions
being
confused
in
the
processes
under
finality.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
it
could
have
--
if
--
if
the
district
court
had
so
determined,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
to
this
effect,
54
(b)
certification
can
be
entered
at
--
judgments
can
be
entered
and
--
and
a
motion
made
to
stay
them
under
62
(h)
and
because
of
a
counterclaim
or
whatever
reason
and
they
can
either
be
stayed
or
not,
not
only
pending
appeal
but
pending
a
final
determination
of
all
the
issues.
the
district
court
certainly
has
that
power,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
to
--
that
goes
to
finality.
that
--
that
goes
to
the
enforcement
of
the
--
of
the
judgment.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
for
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
think
that
harsh
unusual
circumstances
has
never
been
articulated
by
this
court
in
describing
rule
54
(b).
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
the
--
the
district
court
considered
the
fact
that
curtiss-wright
was
being
deprived
of
its
property,
its
monetary
property
and
would
be
so
deprived
for
a
long
time
and
would
suffer
financial
loss
because
of
it
while
the
unadjudicated
claims
of
both
parties
went
through
a
long
process
and
while
the
defendants
in
this
case
had
the
full
use
of
the
property.
but
i--
the
rule
does
not
say
unusual
harsh
circumstances
to
the
extent
of
having
to
prove
some
type
of
irreparable
harm.
the
rule
speaks
in
terms
of,
in
my
view,
what
justice
and
fairness
dictate
and
the
provision
in
the
rule
is
no
just
reason
for
delay.
and,
there's
no
showing
in
this
case
of
a
just
reason
for
delay
other
than
--
other
than
the
fact
that
there
exist
a
counterclaim.
and
they
--
you
cannot
really
accuse
a
district
court
judge
of
having
abused
his
discretion
by
not
incorporating
rule
62
(h)
considerations
in
the
54
(b)
determinative
process
with
respect
to
finality.
the
--
i
think
that
to
sustain
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
policy
of
judicial
economy
and
justice
to
the
litigants,
and
it's
not
--
it
usurps
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
and
i
think
also,
it
--
it
will
put
a
chill
on
attorneys
using
the
joinder
provisions
of
the
rule
enjoining
all
their
claims
were
possible
in
one
case.
i
think
it
would
rather
encourage
them
to
start
a
--
a
number
of
lawsuits
rather
than
do
what
is
judicially
economical
and
--
and
put
them
in
the
one
case.
also,
i
think
that
if
--
if
you
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
of
the
dangers
of
the
third
circuit's
position
in
this
case
is
with
respect
to
counterclaims
that
it
will
encourage
imaginative
counterclaims
certainly,
and
it
will
also
encourage
litigants
to
prolong
litigation
because
we're
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
i
--
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
that
may
well
be.
i
haven't
addressed
myself
to
that
thought,
frankly,
but
i'd
--
i
know
of
very
few
cases
where
imaginative
counsel,
and
i'm
not
accusing
my
opponent
of
being
imaginative,
certainly,
but
i
know
a
very
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
what?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
i
--
excuse
me.
[laughs]
anyway,
i
--
i
know
of
very
few
cases
where
somebody
can't
think
up
a
counterclaim
if
they're
pressed
to
it
and
one
good
enough
to
get
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
and
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
that
was
made
here
on
the
counterclaims,
it's
referred
to
in
our
opponent's
brief.
it
was
by
no
ways
any
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
that
is
a
financial
injustice.
if
you
just
calculate
that,
if
you
just
calculate
by
figuring
the
prejudgment
interest
rate
and
apply
it
against
the
present
rates,
it's
not
$1
million
anymore.
i
think
the
last
time
i
figured
it
out,
your
honor,
it
was
$1,000,008
a
year.
and
of
course,
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
even
get
into
what
--
the
use
of
them,
the
value
or
the
use
of
that
money
in
the
market
place
might
be.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
of
course,
your
honor.
that's
--
that
really
a
62
(h)
consideration.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
even
--
in
this
case,
even
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
right.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
that
i
don't
think
is
a
54--
with
due
respect
to,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
come
under
62
(h)
with
a
stay
on
terms
and
that,
i
suppose,
could
be
one
of
the
terms.
even
normal
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
really
is
that
it
is
not
a
consideration
under
54
(b).
i
feel
that
the
district
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
on
the
finality
issue
and
it's
not
a
--
a
consideration
on
his
--
on
the
question
of
bu--
of
abuse
of
discretion
because
he
--
he
has
the
discretion
under
this
rule
and
he
has
not
abused
it.
and
the
--
there
is
no
standard
of
harsh
unusual
circumstances
that
goes
to
irreparable
harm
here.
we
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
the
motion
that
i
made
was
under
54
(b)
and
i
--
i
think
the
decision
he
made
was
a
correct
one.
the
question
here
is
a
--
a
deprivation
of
property,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
--
as
far
as
injustice
is
concerned,
to
exercise
discretion.
i
don't
know
what
more
injustice
you
could
have
if
what
you're
suggesting
is
--
is
almost
a
settlement
type
of
thing
where
the
court
might
say,
well,
the
money
be
placed
in
--
put
up
and
placed
in
high
yield
securities.
but,
i
think
there,
without
--
i
--
i
don't
know,
the
defendant
might
object
to
that
without
a
final
judgment.
i
think,
really,
that
--
that
62
(h)
is
the
place
to
consider
whether
the
money
should
be
paid
and
who
should
hold
the
money.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
they
--
they
did
not
quarrel
with
that.
their
--
their
dispute
with
the
decisions
was
really
on
the
question
of
harsh
of
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
--
of
the
existence
of
the
counterclaim
and
who
should
hold
the
money.
it
didn't
bother
them,
apparently,
that
--
that
we're
not
holding
our
equipment
anymore
and
that
the
general
electric
counterclaims
are
unadjudicated,
and
that
the
balance
of
our
claims
which
are
substantial
are
also
unadjudicated.
and
that
this
claim
that
we
have
here
is
adjudicated.
it's
a
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
it's
final
judgment.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
to
the
extent
then
that
they
are
saying
that
the
existence
of
a
counterclaim
is
a
just
reason
for
delay,
they
are
in
clear
conflict
with
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
cold
metal
case
which
held
exactly
to
the
contrary.
and
with
the
terminology
of
the
rule
which
envisions
that
any
--
any
claim
for
relief,
whether
it's
in
a
counterclaim
or
in
the
main
action,
can
be
subject
to
entry
of
final
judgment
here.
now,
by
the
fact
that
you
--
for
instance,
you
can
get
a
judgment
on
a
counterclaim,
chances
are,
there's
going
to
be
in
existence
a
complaint.
and
the
mere
existence
of
a
competing
claim
is
not
a
barrier
to
54
(b)
certification
and
entry
of
judgment.
and,
that's
exactly
what
the
third
circuit
is
holding
in
the
--
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
by
dicta
and
in
this
case
straight
out,
and
it's
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
the
third
circuit,
to
the
extent
they
laid
down
any
standard
at
all,
said
that
you
were
--
had
to
deal
with
situations
like
insolvency
and
economic
duress.
they
dealt
with
almost
irreparable
harm
type
situations,
but
they
have
this
rule
confused
with
interlocutory
orders.
and
that's
why
they're
getting
into
that
type
of
consideration.
they're
--
they're
not
treating
it
as
a
final
order,
as
a
final
judgment.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
no.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
no.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
that's
correct.
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
--
the
discretion
that
the
--
that
the
court
is
to
look
to
is
to
see
whether,
as
in
cold
metal,
the
claims
are
separate.
whether
there's
an
interrelation
between
those
claims,
it
poses
problems
of
mootness,
duplicate
of
appeal
and
so
forth,
that
would
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes.
to
admit
it,
that
was
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
none
was
applied
for,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
no,
we
--
the
third
circuit
revert
--
vacated
the
district
court's
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
the
--
the
judge
in
the
district
court
granted
a
stay
pending
appeal.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
it
--
it
then
--
then,
they
would
go
to
the
merits
of
the
original
appeal
which
is
the
5
(c)
release
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
--
clause
in
the
contract.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
think
--
i
think
he's
correct
certainly
in
weighing
it
insofar
as
the
interrelationship
of
the
claims
and
the
counterclaim
and
the
main
case,
applying
the
cold
metal
standard
and
the
sears
standard
as
to
the
fact
that
you
look
to
the
interrelationship
of
those
claims.
insofar
as
the
balance
of
it,
i
--
whether
he
--
whether
or
not
he
weighed
it
on
any
other
basis,
i
--
i,
you
know,
i
--
i
can't
tell
you
what
all
of
his
mental
processes
were
but
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
the
difference
between
prejudgment
interest
rate
and
the
interest
which
we
would
get
even
if
this
judgment
were
final
and
stayed
is
considerable
because
the
new
york
prejudgment
interest
rate
is
significantly
lower
than
the
interest
rate
applicable
to
judgments,
so
the
last
statement
that
was
made
that
the
--
this
has
the
same
effect
as
a
stay
under
62
(h)
is
inaccurate.
the
--
we
would
still
lose
half
a
million
dollar
--
we
would
--
there's
a
half
a
million
dollar
differential
a
year
just
in
the
difference
of
prejudgment
postjudgment
interest
rates.
besides,
prejudgment
interest
rates
are
meant
to
apply
before
a
claim
is
finalized
and
adjudicated.
our
--
our
claim
is
final,
it
has
been
adjudicated.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
i
--
i
think
also,
the
deprivation
of
property,
in
and
of
itself,
it's
--
the
--
the
difference
in
the
interest
rate
makes
--
shows
you
how
much
the
loss
is.
the
loss
of
the
use
of
the
property
is
significant,
not
being
able
to
have
it,
to
use
it
in
--
in
their
operations.
and
i
assure
you,
if
there's
any
misconception
here,
i
want
to
resolve
it.
$20
million
is
a
lot
of
money
to
curtiss-wright.
it's
--
it's
not
an
insignificant
amount
if--
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
but
i'd
like
to
read
from
this
advisory
committee
note
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
i
don't
think
you
--
i
--
i
think
this
is
what
the
rule
was
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
the
--
this
is
quite
within
the
rule.
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
i
--
we
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
your
honor,
the
purpose
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
pardon?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
i
think
you
have
to
take
in
all
the
facts
in
the
--
in
the
case.
in
this
case
for
instance,
judge
coolahan's
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
say,
in
this
case
if
you
permit
me
to
answer
your
question
was
that
judge
coolahan
also
noted
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
lengthy
proceeding.
so
it's
--
it's
not
just
the
loss
of
that
much
money.
it's
the
loss
of
that
much
money
over
a
long
period
of
time.
the
--
that
much
--
a
smaller
amount
might
be
de
minimis
to
one
litigant.
i
think
this
is
why
the
--
the
--
this
is
why
the
discretion
is
given
to
the
district
court
judge.
the
money
that
we're
losing
on
the
interest
rates,
for
instance,
can
never
be
recouped.
if
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
general
electric
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
--
counterclaims
are
dismissed.
pardon?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
well,
if
at
the
--
well,
your
honor,
we'll
always
get
the
--
we'll
always
get
the
$20
million,
but
we'll
never
recoup
the
difference
in
the
interest
at
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
i
read
from
this
advisory
committee
note
that
was
referred
to.
it
says,
“rule
54
(b)
was
originally
adopted
in
view
of
the
wide
scope
and
possible
content
of
the
newly
created
civil
action
in
order
to
avoid
the
possible
injustice
of
a
delay
in
judgment
on
distinctly
separate
claim
to
await
adjudication
of
the
entire
case.”
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
injustice
resulting
from
the
delay
of
our
claim.
we
--
the
third
circuit
wishes
to
equate
the
kind
of
injustice
we
have
to
show
over
and
above
the
obvious
injustice
to
something
relating
to
insolvency
and
economic
duress.
but
if
we
were
insolvent,
my
opponent
would
be
here
saying
that
--
that
we
shouldn't
get
the
money
because
we
would
go
broke
and
lose
it
if
we
had
to
pay
it
back.
so,
that's
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
pardon?
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
which,
if
we
were
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
--
insolvent
we
couldn't
afford,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
thank
--
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
in
--
in
similar
cases,
which
this
court
has
had
in
liberty
mutual
and
tilden,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit
has
permitted
such
cases
to
come
to
be
certified.
in
fact,
they
did
it
erroneously.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
yes,
they've
never
used
harsh
unusual
circumstances
in
cases
without
counterclaims
that
--
that
i
know
of.
mr.
ralph
n.
del
deo
it's
the
only
reason
that
they've
articulated
and
it's
the
one
i
see,
your
honors.
thank
you.
