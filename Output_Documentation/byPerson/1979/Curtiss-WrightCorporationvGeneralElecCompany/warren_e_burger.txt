chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
curtiss-wright
corporation
against
general
electric
corporation.
mr.
del
deo,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
haven't
heard
you
describe
the
harsh
and
extraordinary
circumstances
that
are
postulated
as
the
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
did
the
district
courts
consider
was
the
circumstances
that
justified
his
certification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
haven't
pinpointed
what
i
thought
i
read
in
your
brief
that
the
--
one
of
the
harsh
circumstances
here
is
that
they're
going
to
be
deprived
specifically
of
about
$1
million
a
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
served
your
purposes,
your
client's
purposes
if
the
judge
had
ordered
that
the
judgment
be
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
courts
and
invested
in
high
yield
government
obligations
pending
the
outcome
of
the
suits,
so
that
there
might
be
11%
or
12%
return,
instead
of
6%
return?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know
you
--
you'd
--
you'd
gotten
into
the
subject,
or
at
least
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
on
the
edge
of
the
subject
of
imaginative
or
innovative
remedies.
and
that's
why
i
--
i
raised
this
question,
wondering
whether
that
would
solve
the
problem
--
would
have
solved
the
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
saying
that
that
would
be
within
the
equity
powers
of
--
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
on
the
finality
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
--
i
submit
to
you
only
that
if
you
agreed
that
this
would
be
a
reasonable
solution,
the
hypothetical
solution
i
suggested,
then
would
that
not
have
some
bearing
on
the
arguments
you're
making
about
the
correctness
of
the
district
judge's
ruling?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
have
to
--
he
had
alternative
remedies,
this
hypothetical
one
being
possibly
one
and
the
one
he
adopted
based
on
finality
being
another
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
del
deo.
mr.
groner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
--
before
you
go
into
that,
mr.
groner,
that
the
district
court
wasn't
aware
of
all
these
factors
when
he
did
this
weighing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
--
at
what
--
at
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
--
it
would
help
me
if
you'd
indicate
it
what
date
the
revisers'
notes,
if
you
have
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
have
just
tell
us
--
and
what
i
take
it
you're
telling
us
and
about
to
enlarge
on
is
that
the
loss
of
$1,000,008
a
year
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
judge
to
say,
to
believe,
that
the
loss
of
$1,000,008
per
year
on
this
interest
problem
was
an
--
was
simply
not
founded,
that
that
didn't
bring
it
within
the
infrequent
exception
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
it
has
to
be
a
situation
almost
like
chrysler
motor
company
that
it's
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
if
it
doesn't
get
some
cash
right
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
--
is
the
judgment
of
this
size
on
--
does
that
fall
in
the
category
of
an
ordinary
money
--
money
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
this
about,
$20
million,
the
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not
very
ordinary,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
very
ordinary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
accept
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
accept
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
speaking
of
relativity,
mr.
groner,
i
suppose
if
the
advisory
committee
in
the
rulemaking
process
was
trying
to
have
some
firm
rules
that
would
be
applicable
forever,
$20
million
in
1946
isn't
the
same
as
$20
million
in
1980,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
groner,
if
you
know,
has
there
been
any
great
rush
of
certifications
under
rule
54?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
--
i
must
say
that
there's
some
observation
of
that
in
a
general
way
up
here
and
i
have
never
heard
that
there
has
been
any
great
use
of
the
rule
of
exceptions,
such
as
judge
coolahan
made
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
district
judge
here
obviously
placed
his
emphasis
on
the
extraordinary
aspect
of
this
case,
that
is
the
large
amounts
involved
and
on
the
fact
that
these
issues
could
be
treated
separately
and
on
the
fact
that
if
he
was
in
error
in
his
exercise
of
discretion,
there
could
be
a
judgment,
a
collectible
judgment
the
other
way.
those
three
factors
were
all
in
his
--
his
finding,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
cuts
down
the
scope
of
rule
54
quite
a
bit,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
well,
you
--
you
would
take
that
out
of
--
you
would
say
that's
not
a
factor
the
district
judge
may
consider.
you
have
just
said
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
who
--
who
tells
us
--
where
do
we
find
out
that
he
never
was
able
to
consider
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
del
deo,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
equate
that
to
a
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
you
put
up
a
bond.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
you
put
up
a
bond
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
roberts
against
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
--
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
79-105,
curtiss-wright
corporation
against
general
electric
company.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion
filed
today.
