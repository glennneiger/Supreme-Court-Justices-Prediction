william
h.
rehnquist
could
those
counterclaims
be
fairly
characterized
as
unliquidated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
del
deo,
you
--
i
take
it,
you
don't
question
either
this
--
of
the
statements
in
sears,
roebuck
versus
mackey
that
the
district
--
the
primary
discretion
to
certify
under
rule
54
is
vested
in
the
district
court
or
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
review
that
certification
for
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
437,
let
me
quote
you
this
language
from
sears,
roebuck.
the
--
the
court
says,
“the
district
court
cannot,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
treat
as
final
that
which
is
not
final
within
the
meaning
of
section
1210
--
1291.
but
the
district
court
may,
by
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
in
the
interest
of
sound
judicial
administration,
release
for
appeal
final
decisions
upon
one
or
more,
but
less
than
all,
claims
in
multiple
claims
actions.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
--
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
“primary
--
primary
discretion
in
the
district
court
--
the
abuse
of
discretion
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.”
now,
how
do
you
articulate
the
standard
by
which
you
feel
should
have
been
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
wasn't
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
129
could
be
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
1292
(b),
where
the
district
court
certifies
them,
the
court
of
appeals
can
accept
or
reject.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
that
this
appeal
could
have
proceeded
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits
and
then
the
judgment
nonetheless,
be
--
have
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
the
third
circuit
ruling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
third
circuit
here
conceded
that
these
decisions
are
final
under
1291,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
just
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
it
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
in
the
--
it's
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
third
--
third
circuit,
and
i
think
analytically,
would
have
to
make
its
reversal
of
the
district
court
turn
on
the
no
just
reason
for
delay
standard
in
rule
54.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
didn't
--
did
--
did
you
feel
they
laid
--
laid
down
a
flat
rule
that
any
time
there's
a
counterclaim,
the
--
the
district
court
is
not
entitled
to
certify
under
rule
54?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
an
even
more
effective
way
to
prevent
piecemeal
appeals
would
have
been
avoid
--
to
avoid
adopting
rule
54
(b)
at
all,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
us,
you're
not
referring
to
general
electric,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
--
among
--
a
$1,000,008
being
to
cur
--
curtiss-wright
like
a
few
$100
would
be
to
general
electric?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
if
the
third
circuit,
mr.
groner,
had
said
in
this
case,
considering
rule
54
(b)
and
the
--
its
relationship
to
the
tradition
against
piecemeal
appeals,
that
in
any
case
in
which
there
is
a
pending
plausible
counterclaim,
a
district
court
in
this
circuit
shall
not
certify
for
appeal
a
--
a
final
decision
on
person
to
rule
54
(b).
do
you
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
sears,
roebuck
versus
mackey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
--
the
--
but
i'm
--
my
mind
is
a
hypothetical
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
it's
not
a
proper
ruling
--
reading
of
rule
54
(b)
but
is
what
the
third
circuit
did,
then
it
ought
to
be
reversed.
