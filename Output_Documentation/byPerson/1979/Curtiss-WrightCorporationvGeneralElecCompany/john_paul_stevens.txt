mr.
del
deo,
that
really
wouldn't
be
up
to
you
in
this
case,
would
it?
because
your
opponent
always
has
at
least
a
permissive
counterclaim
and
if
he
wants
the
benefit
of
delay
as
a
result
of
a
counterclaim,
he
can
always
file
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting,
i
just
want
to
make
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
my
point
more
narrow.
you
were
suggesting
--
you
have
a
--
a
group
of
claims
on
--
for
--
for
--
on
the
contract
and
you
also
have
some
claims
for
additional
moneys
because
of
alleged
fraud
and
the
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
were
suggesting
that
you
would
be
discouraged
from
joining
those
in
the
same
action
by
this
--
by
a
contrary
rule,
but
it
seems
to
me,
even
if
you
had
separate
actions
for
your
two
groups
of
claims,
general
electric
could
still
counterclaim
in
which
ever
one
they
chose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
del
deo,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
i
--
did
you
answer
justice
rehnquist's
question?
is
it
your
position
that
whenever
there's
a
counterclaim,
you
are
--
you
--
the
--
the
prevailing
party
on
the
original
complaint
is
always
entitled
to
a
54
(b)
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
take
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
do
you
take
this
--
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
no
just
reason
for
delay
language
only
goes
to
the
question,
whether
the
case
is
appropriate
for
appeal
and
that
the
questions
of
financial
solvency
and
collectability
nor
other
questions
that
are
appropriately
raised
under
62
(h)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
piecemeal
appeal
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
stay
under
62
(h)
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
judgment
been
collected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
there
was
a
period
before
it
was
argued
in
the
third
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
there
was
a
--
but
now,
if
you
win
here,
is
it
correct
that
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
third
circuit
for
them
to
pass
on
this
contract
defense,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
groner,
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing.
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
the
judgment
was
final?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
--
do
you
then
question
his
power
to
enter
54
(b)
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
question
his
power
to
enter
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
no
just
reason
for
delay,
then
it
would
be
a
--
the
kind
of
order
which
could
be
made
final
by
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
groner,
can
i
suggest
another
approach
to
the
case?
that
perhaps
one
could
read
62
(h)
as
being
primarily
directed
at
questions
of
solvency
and
collectability
and
things
like
that,
and
that
54
(b)
is
primarily
directed
at
the
--
the
problems
related
to
piecemeal
appeals
and
total
conclusion
of
litigation.
and,
if
in
the
judge's
discretion,
he
thought
it
might
expedite
winding
up
the
whole
case
to
get
a
part
of
it
settled
finally,
but
then
the
rest
of
it
might
be
settled
by
--
by
adjustment
between
the
parties.
would
that
be
a
proper
consideration
for
the
judge
to
take
into
account?
that
there's
a
better
chance
of
settling
this
monstrous
litigation
if
we
get
this
$18
million
item
out
of
the
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
thinking
in
terms
of
getting
the
whole
case
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
a
district
judge
who
isn't
constantly
thinking
about
ways
to
get
a
case
of
this
magnitude
settled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
on
this
record,
he
didn't
articulate
any
such
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
groner,
in
--
in
one
sense,
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
he
abused
his
discretion
in
finding
no
just
reason
for
delay.
does
anything
in
the
revisers'
notes
or
the
history
of
the
rule
tell
us
on
whom
the
burden
falls
on
the
just
reason
for
delay
issue?
is
it
upon
the
proponent
of
the
finding
to
say
--
had
to
say
at
the
burden
of
showing,
there
is
no
just
reason
or
is
it
on
the
one
who
says
there
is
a
just
reason
to
point
out
the
reason?
