mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
jus
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
ground
upon
which
respondent
relies
is
that
rule
54
(b)
was
a
rule
in
the
service
of,
and
not
contrary
to,
the
fundamental
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
and
that
the
third
circuit
was
correct
when
it
vacated
the
district
court's
entry
of
the
judgment
as
final
which
made
it
appealable
under
section
1291
for
the
reason
that
there
--
the
--
the
grounds
upon
which
the
district
court
relied
did
not
comport
with
the
tests
which
were
established
at
the
beginning
in
the
adoption
of
rule
54
(b)
and
were
consistent
with
the
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
that
that
is
correct
and
it
was
a
very
serious
question
to
the
--
to
the
advisory
committee
on
the
rules
and
to
the
court
presumably
in
adopting
them,
as
to
precisely
what
scope
should
be
allowed.
deviation
from
the
previous
rules
that
there
could
no
--
could
be
no
piecemeal
appeals
and
there
is
no
question
that
what
was
intended
and
what
was
provided
was
only
a
very,
very
narrow
exception
and
that
the
burden
was
to
be
upon
someone
who
was
claiming
that
exception.
let
me
read
to
you,
if
i
may,
the
concluding
sentences
of
the
advisory
committee
report
and
then
refer
to
the
initial
sentence.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
--
i
could
not
say
that
he
was
not
aware
of
it.
there
is
no
reference,
your
honor,
to
the
advisor's
notes.
there
is
reference
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
allis-chalmers
which
--
and
to
other
cases
of
the
third
--
third
circuit
which
show
recognition
of
the
revisers'
notes
and
the
very
narrow
standard.
the
judge
certainly
sought
to
apply
that
standard
in
good
faith.
in
our
view,
as
in
the
view
of
the
third
circuit,
he
abused
the
discretion
by
exceeding
the
narrow
bounds
and,
indeed,
relying
upon
grounds
which
are
improper
to
be
relied
upon.
first,
to
show
how
narrow
the
exception
to
the
rule
against
piecemeal
appeals
was
intended
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
i
take
it
that
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
--
the
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh,
no,
no.
no,
no,
your
honor.
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
judgment
is
not
to
be
considered
final
in
a
case
in
which
there
are
a
multitude
of
--
of
claims,
unless
and
until
the
district
judge
validly
enters
a
certification.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there's
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
that
in
that
sense,
we
don't
--
we
don't
question
his
jurisdiction
at
all.
to
turn
to
the
revisers'
notes
which
this
court,
in
other
context,
has
held
do
indeed
give
guidance
as
to
what
the
intention
of
the
revisers'
were
and
what
the
intention
embodied
in
the
amendments
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are.
after
extended
consideration,
the
advisory
committee
said
“it,”
meaning
itself,
“concluded
that
a
retention
of
the
older
federal
rule
was
desirable
and
that
older
federal
rule,”
as
i
shall
make
clear
beyond
doubt,
“was
the
rule
against
piecemeal
appeals.”
returning
to
the
revisers',
“and
that
this
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
these
were,
i
believe,
in
1946,
your
honor.
for
the
1946,
the
amendment
adopted
in
1946,
effective
in
1948,
which
put
the
pertinent
words
of
the
--
of
rule
54
(b)
as
they
are
today,
although
there
was
a
later
amendment
that
had
to
do
with
multiple
parties
and
not
with
any
issue
that
i'm
aware
of
that
we're
talking
about
this
afternoon.
after
extended
consideration,
it
concluded
that
a
retention
of
the
older
federal
rule
was
desirable
and
that
this
rule
needed
only
the
exercise
of
a
discretionary
power
to
afford
a
remedy
in
the
infrequent
harsh
case
to
provide
a
simple
definite
workable
rule.
this
is
afforded
by
amended
rule
54
(b).
it
reestablishes
an
ancient
policy
with
clarity
and
precision
and
the
initial
sentence
in
the
revisers'
note
is
the
historic
rule
in
the
federal
courts
has
always
prohibited
piecemeal
disposal
of
litigation
and
permitted
appeals
only
from
final
judgments
except
in
those
instances
--
except
in
those
special
instances
covered
by
statute.
now,
this
ancient
rule,
as
it
existed
and
was
consistently
applied
by
this
court
prior
to
the
1946
amendment,
was
that
there
should
be
no
appeal
and
that
there
could
be
no
appeal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed.
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
and
--
and
the
question
as
we
would
see
before
this
court
is
whether
that
exception
is
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
narrowly
as
was
intended
by
the
revisers,
so
that
there
will
be
fundamental
adherence
to
the
rule
against
piecemeal
appeals
or
whether
there
shall
be
deviation
from
that
rule
spreading
the
exception
so
wide
as
to
embrace
virtually
every
money
judgment
case.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
precisely
our
position,
your
honor.
and
it
is
precisely
our
position
that
if
there
is
to
be
an
exception
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
money
judgment
and
that
the
market
rate
of
interest,
that
is
to
say,
the
rate
charged
to
borrowers
of
funds,
exceeds
the
statutory
interest
rate.
those
grounds
would
apply
to
every
money
judgment.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
would
be
the
type
of
case
that
we
would
think
the
framers
of
--
of
the
rule
intended
and
would
be
an
infrequent
harsh
case
because
that
would
be
a
case
that
would
present
special
circumstances.
to
say
that
the
ordinary
money
judgment
presents
special
circumstances
could
not
--
if
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
it
--
it
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it's
almost
$20
million,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
would
not
say
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
--
it
depends,
your
honor
on
whether
we're
adopting
an
absolute
standard
or
a
relative
standard.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
to
me,
that
is
huge.
on
the
other
hand,
there
may
be
corporations,
curtiss-wright
may
be
included,
to
whom
this
would
be
the
same
kind
of
relative
money
judgment
as
perhaps
a
few
$100
would
be
to
us.
in
any
event,
it
was
not
so
large
a
sum
that
curtiss-wright
even
tried
to
present
to
the
district
court
any
specific
grounds
for
saying
that
this
is
an
infrequent
harsh
case.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
was
really
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
was
really
only
trying
to
apply
a
relative
test
that
in
all
candor,
i
would
not
know
how
the
relative
test
would
come
out
for
any
individual
or
for
any
corporation.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
would
suppose
not,
your
honor,
but
i
--
again
i
repeat
that
it
is
a
large
sum
of
money.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
two
grounds
that
we
respectfully
urge,
is
not
a
proper
ground
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
account.
the
district
court
said
this
is
a
large
sum
of
money
and
it
will
earn
a
large
sum
of
money
in
interest
in
terms
of
the
difference
between
the
statutory
interest
and
the
market
interest
rate.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
considerations
in
rule
54
(b)
are
whether
there
ought
to
be
an
appeal
at
this
particular
court.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
thinking
in
terms
of
--
of,
perhaps,
of
getting
the
whole
case
over
but
weighing
that
in
terms
of
the
historic
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals,
which
has
well-grounded
public
policy
considerations
for
it.
the
effect
upon
the
litigation
of
the
other
claims
would
be
a
proper
consideration.
there's
no
indication
here
in
any
way
that
the
judge
thought
that
the
disposition
of
the
litigation
would
be
expedited
or
facilitated
by
resolution
of
this
issue.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
your
honor,
there
--
there
is
no
indication
of
that.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--
and
there's
a
--
there
is
--
if
that
was
a
consideration,
that
sort
of
consideration
may
well
be
the
kind
of
consideration
that
ought
to
be
weighed
in
terms
of
its
significance
as
against
the
historic
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
and
to
say
that
a
judge
may
certify
as
final
under
rule
54
(b)
and
require
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on
the
appeal,
a
piecemeal
disposition
of
a
particular
claim
because
he
may
have
an
unarticulated
opinion
that
it
may
expedite
settlement,
does
not
fall,
we
believe,
within
the
purposes
or
the
effects
of
the
rule.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
we
do
--
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
did.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
they
had
done
so,
if
they
had
established
a
rule
which
actually
barred
the
district
judge
from
certifying
any
case
in
which
you
--
there
was
a
counterclaim,
we
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
certainly,
the
framers
of
rule
54
(b)
intended
that
there
be
discretion,
we
are
talking
about
the
standards
for
the
exercise
of
discretion.
and
to
provide
that
kind
of
absolute
rule,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
regard
it
as
proper
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
so.
and,
although
petitioner
does
attempt
to
frame
the
question
at
some
point
and
even
at
some
point
this
afternoon
stated
that
the
question
was
whether
the
certification
should
be
barred
when
there
are
counterclaims.
that
is
not
what
the
third
circuit
did
and
in
any
event,
that
is
not
a
proper
reading
of
rule
54
(b).
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
not
what
the
third
circuit
did,
your
honor.
the
third
circuit
said
that
in
the
absence
of
harsh
and
unusual
circumstances,
the
existence
of
a
counterclaim
is
a
factor
that
weighs
heavily
against
the
certification
of
a
judgment
as
final.
in
other
words,
what
they
were
saying
is
--
is
two
things.
one,
that
this
is
a
factor
which
we
think
should
be
given
importance
and,
secondly,
precisely
by
wording
it
as
a
factor,
they
were
saying,
“this
is
an
issue
where
discretion
should
be
allowed.
we
are
not
barring,
we
are
not
putting
forth
any
absolute
rules.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
a
matter
of
particular
facts.”
and
under
these
particular
facts
on
this
record,
that
is
a
factor
to
which
we,
the
court
of
appeals,
ascribe
potent
weight.
no
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
we
do
not
know,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
we
--
we
have
--
we
have
not
made
such
a
study,
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
would
encourage
more
rule
54
(b)
certifications
and
more
rule
54
(b)
disputes.
we
would
not
necessarily
describe
it
as
a
rush
because
in
all
candor,
we
would
have
no
way
of
predicting
it.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
the
ordinary
--
the
ordinary
case
may
or
may
not
involve
separate
issues,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
are
many
--
there
are
many
cases
in
which
there
are
--
there
are
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
apply
rule
54
(b).
the
annotations
of
course
do
contain
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
is
relative,
yes.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
compared
to
other
issues,
compared
to
rule
56
issues,
for
example.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
certainly,
they
--
they
are
small
in
number.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
large
amount
of
money
was
critical,
it
appears
to
us,
not
so
much
for
its
own
sake
but
for
the
difference
in
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--
interest
rate
which
it
represented.
we'd
like
to
say,
first
of
all,
as
to
the
amount
of
money,
what
you
have
as
a
district
judge
who
in
effect
is
saying,
“i
am
reaching
a
different
decision
because
a
claim
is
large
in
effect
because
there's
a
large
corporation
making
that
claim,
then
i
would
make
if
the
claim
were
scall
--
small.
and,
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
type
of
determination
for
a
system
which
grants
equal
justice
under
law.
perhaps
more
significantly,
for
a
district
judge
to
be
concerned
with
the
difference
in
interest
rate
between
what
state
law
has
provided
and
this
in
a
diversity
case,
and
what
he
regards
as
the
market
rate
of
interest
is
for
him
to
be
concerned
with
something
which
ought
not
to
concern
him.
the
state
of
new
york
which
was
a
governing
law
with
respect
to
this
issue,
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
a
particular
percentage
rate
of
interest
on
judgments.
the
legislature
and
the
governor
and
the
entire
later
--
legislative
process
of
the
state
of
new
york
must
have
been
well
aware
of
the
competing
considerations,
the
desire
for
definiteness
for
a
set
rate
in
all
cases
as
against
the
factors
on
the
other
side,
namely
that
there
would
be
market
variances
and
that
there
might
be
the
possibility
in
a
commercial
sense
of
obtaining
a
higher
interest
rate.
now,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
decided
that
it
would
provide
a
set
rate,
not
a
flexible
rate
depending
on
a
market
rate,
and
it
made
that
applicable
to
the
kinds
--
kind
of
judgment
that
is
involved
here.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
believe
1970
or
1971,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
about
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york,
your
honor,
but,
in
any
event,
if
they
do,
they
would
know
that
and
it
is
precisely
that
the
legislature
would
take
into
account,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
what
would
happen
in
the
future
that
this
is
a
matter
of
legislative
policy.
certainly,
the
legislature
understood
that
in
the
future,
there
might
be
all
kinds
of
economic
situations,
there
might
be
inflation,
there
might
be
elevations
in
the
interest
rate.
they
had
the
possibility
of
making
a
flexible
rate,
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
now
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
a
senate
bill
passed
by
the
senate
is
now
before
the
house
which
would
make
applicable
the
judgments
in
federal
cases
a
variable
interest
rate.
it
would
make
applicable
to
judgments
the
interest
rate
provided
in
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
tied
to
the
market
rate.
now,
what
is
involved
here
is
a
judge,
in
effect
saying
what
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
provided
is
improper,
is
unjust.
in
my
judgment,
in
this
case,
if
i
applied
the
new
york
--
the
--
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
the
legislature
has
adopted
it
and
specified
it,
then
curtiss-wright
will
lose
more
money
than
i'd
like
to
see
a
litigant
lose.
and
in
a
diversity
case,
we
say
to
your
honors
that
that
is
an
improper
judgment
for
a
federal
district
judge
to
make.
we
say,
further,
that
the
matter
of
interest
rates
on
judgments
is
clearly
a
legislative
matter.
as
i've
indicated,
there
is
a
senate
bill
which
seeks
to
change
that.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
many
different
provisions
with
respect
to
interest
in
different
statutes.
in
some
cases,
they
have
provide
--
provided
for
no
interest
with
respect
to
the
united
states.
in
other
cases,
they
provided
different
rates,
but
the
congress
has
been
the
one
which
has
regulated
that
subject
matter.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
we
do
not
think
so,
your
honor,
because,
in
our
view
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
is
a
factor
which
he
never
was
enable
to
consider
under
rule
54
(b).
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
so,
we
are
not
reducing
the
scope.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
you
find
that,
your
honor,
from
two
different
sources.
one
is
the
provision
or
--
or
the
guidance
provided
by
the
advisers.
if
they
had
thought
when
they
specified
the
infrequent
harsh
case,
we
submit
that
we
are
talking
about
factors
that
are
applicable
uniquely
to
particular
litigants.
we
are
not
talking
about
factors
that
are
applicable
to
groups
of
cases.
that
is
one
source
of
our
submission
that
it
was
improper
for
the
district
judge
to
take
the
rate
of
interest
into
account.
the
second
source
is
the
very
concept
of
whether
establishing
and
enforcing
a
rate
of
interest
for
judgment
lies
within
the
judicial
province
at
all,
whether
it
does
now
or
whether
it
did
when
the
rule
was
adopted
or
amended.
we
--
we
submit
to
your
honors,
it
clearly
is
not
within
the
judicial
province
that
congress,
for
federal
judgments
and
state
legislatures
for
state
judgments
have
provided
that
the
--
have
provided
what
the
rule
should
be.
and
we
cite
the
funkhouser
case
as
a
holding
of
this
court
which
says
that
the
establishment
of
a
rate
of
interest
on
judgments
is
a
matter
for
the
legislative
province.
so,
we
say
to
your
honor
that
when
a
judge
takes
a
factor
into
account
which
is
within
the
legislative
purview,
he
is
not
acting
in
a
way
which
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
sustain
as
a
proper
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
in
our
view,
it
quite
clearly
falls
upon
the
one
who
is
proposing
that
the
judgment
be
final.
and
this
is
a
reflection,
in
our
view,
again
of
the
bedrock
consideration
that
the
general
rule
is
that
there
shall
be
no
piecemeal
appeals.
so
that
it
is
the
supplicant
for
the
exception
to
the
rule
who
has
that
burden
and
we
say,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
effort
to
meet
that
burden.
there
was
no
effort
to
show
that
there
was
anything
unique
about
curtiss-wright
which
distinguished
it
from
any
other
holder
of
a
money
judgment
which
would
justify
holding
this
to
be
the
infrequent
harsh
case.
the
fact
that
the
--
the
extent
to
which
the
claims
and
counterclaims
may
be
independent
or
the
prospective
mootness
of
the
issues,
in
our
view,
set
the
stage.
they
do
not
deal
with
the
question
which
is
whether
or
not
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
parties
should
be
taken
up
with
an
appeal
at
this
particular
time.
i
note,
for
example,
that
the
judge
found
that
granting
this
certification
would
not
prevent
the
rest
of
the
case
from
coming
to
trial.
he
did
not
say
that
it
would
eat
it
and,
quite
clearly,
any
time
there
is
an
appeal,
there
is
some
diversion
of
the
attention
in
the
scope
of
resources
in
the
litigation
from
the
trial
process
to
the
appellate
process,
and
this
is
part
of
the
public
policy
which
is
involved
in
the
rule
against
piecemeal
appeals.
and
this
is
the
general
rue
which
is
involved,
in
our
view,
in
this
case.
now,
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
the
funds
that
are
of
concern
here
are
not
funds
that
have
been
available
to
the
use
of
the
general
electric
company.
they
are
funds,
if
you
want
to
look
for
them,
they
are
in
a
public
fist.
general
electric,
under
its
prime
contract,
receives
the
funds
only
as
reimbursement
after
it
pays
them
out,
so
that
there
is
--
the
actual
funds
are
funds
in
the
treasury,
rather
than
with
general
electric
and
that's
where
they
have
been
during
this
time.
in
our
view,
to
say
that
because
considerations
are
appropriate
under
one
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
they
may
not
be
applied
under
another
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
is
plainly
inaccurate.
whether
or
not
any
of
these
considerations
are
appropriate
to
an
application
under
rule
62
(h)
is
beside
the
point,
in
our
view,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
proper
under
rule
54
(b).
each
of
these
rules
has
different
functions,
and
the
function
of
rule
54
(b)
is
related
to
the
traffic
to
the
appellate
process
and
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
is
a
narrow
one.
whether
or
not
there
ought
to
be
a
stay,
pending
an
appeal
or
pending
some
other
time,
is
not
the
province
of
rule
54
(b).
in
effect,
the
disposition
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
right
now
has
led
to
the
same
practical
result
as
a
grant
of
the
62
(h)
stay
because,
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
there
will
be
no
execution
of
the
judgment
and
there
will
be
no
appeal
decision
until
after
there
has
been
trial
of
the
other
claims.
thank
you,
your
honors.
