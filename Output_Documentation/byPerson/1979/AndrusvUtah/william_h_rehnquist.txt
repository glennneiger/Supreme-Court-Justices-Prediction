justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
has
it
taken
the
secretary
so
long
to
pass
on
any
of
these
selections?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
where
there
could
be
a
delay
of
several
years,
and
i
can
see
why
there
could
be
delays
on
particular
sections,
but
to
just
have
a
complete
blockage
for
a
period
of
more
than
ten
years
strikes
me
as
quite
unusual.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
has
also
been
a
change
in
policy
in
the
department
of
the
interior,
hasn't
there?
a
change
in
position
as
to
the
secretary's
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
there
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
it
had
not
been
the
--
the
department
did
not
follow
that
policy
at
an
earlier
date?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buscemi,
you
referred
to
secretary
udall's
approval
of
the
memorandum
on
pages
43
through
45
of
the
appendix.
do
you
think
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
that
memorandum
and
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
of
the
department
on
page
41
of
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
department
has,
then,
changed
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
that
extent
the
present
policy
does
not
stand
on
quite
the
same
footing
as
if
it
had
been
contemporaneous
and
consistently
followed
under
the
traditional
rules
we've
applied
in
giving
validity
to
administrative
interpretation
of
congressional
acts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
to
that
extent
the
policy,
one
way
or
another,
would
predate
the
statute
permitting
mineral
lands
to
be
selected?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
first
time
the
disparate
value
issue
might
have
come
up,
wouldn't
be
when
the
mineral
lands
were
approved
as
open
to
selection?
it's
older
than
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
the
length
of
congressman
aspinall's
tenure
as
chairman
of
this
house
interior
subcommittee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
shouldn't
be
blamed
for
not
remembering
that
long.
i
am
sure
it
began
well
before
your
birth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
he
had
complete
control,
you
don't
mean
that
he
could
simply
flatly
refuse
to
allow
a
newly
admitted
state
any
sections?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
secretary
is
under
any
duty
to
act
within
any
time
limit
or
reasonable
time
on
a
state's
request
for
lieu
lands
or
state
selection
of
lieu
lands,
assuming
that
he
does
have
discretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
its
basic
thrust
was
to
open
up
more
public
lands,
wasn't
it?
to
private
development?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
grazing
districts
themselves
would
then
be
subject
to
taylor
grazing
act
leases
to
private
individuals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
don't
have
a
grazing
districts,
and
the
idea
wasn't
the
government
was
going
to
graze
cattle
on
those
grazing
districts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
1947
case
distinguish
between
the
various
four
nouns,
settlement,
location,
entry,
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
you
don't
call
a
taylor
grazing
act
lease
an
entry,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
took
an
act
of
congress
in
the
1960's
in
order
to
prevent
mineral
usage
from
being
allowed
on
areas
in
some
of
the
western
states
where
homes
had
been
built,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
reference
in
the
act,
do
you
mean
in
the
text
of
the
act
enacted
by
congress
or
in
the
legislative
discussion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buscemi,
i
have
a
question
or
two
i'd
like
to
ask
you.
do
you
think
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
impliedly
repealed
any
earlier
federal
statutes
relating
to
federal
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
provisions
relating
to
allocation
of
lieu
lands
to
the
states,
the
western
states,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
after
the
enactment
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
do
you
think
the
president
could,
or
the
secretary
acting
for
the
president,
could
have
withdrawn
all
public
land
in
any
state
for
the
purposes
of
classification,
even
against
a
request
by
the
state
for
lieu
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
remedy
did
the
state
have
in
a
case
where
the
secretary
for
15
years
has
refused
to
approve
a
request
for
lieu
land?
