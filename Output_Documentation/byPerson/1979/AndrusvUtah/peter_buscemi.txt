mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
presents
a
question
concerning
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
reviewing
state
applications
for
public
lands
to
replace
lost
school
lands
and
the
roots
of
this
controversy
go
back
a
long
way.
as
new
states
were
created
out
of
federal
territories
throughout
the
19th
century,
congress
granted
the
states
one
or
more
enumerated
sections
in
each
township
for
school
purposes.
when
ohio
joined
the
union
in
1803,
it
became
the
first
state
to
receive
such
a
grant.
throughout
the
first
half
of
the
19th
century,
most
states
received
one
section
per
township,
section
16,
and
then
beginning
with
california
in
1853
the
general
rule
was
two
sections
of
township,
and
utah,
arizona,
and
new
mexico
were
the
only
states
that
upon
joining
the
union
received
four
school
sections
in
every
township
throughout
the
state.
now,
the
problem
presented
in
this
case
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
designated
numbered
sections
specifically
granted
to
the
states
by
congress
were
sometimes
unavailable
for
any
one
of
a
variety
of
reasons.
sometimes
a
given
section
was
homesteaded
or
it
had
been
placed
in
a
national
park
or
a
national
forest,
or
perhaps
an
indian
reservation,
and
most
obviously,
sometimes
a
township
was
fractional
and
the
enumerated
section
simply
didn't
exist.
so
recognizing
that
possibility,
congress
provided
for
it
and
said
that
states
that
receive
school
lands
could,
if
any
of
the
specifically
enumerated
sections
were
unavailable,
select
other
unappropriated
public
lands
as
replacements
for
the
lost
sections.
the
selections
authorized
by
congress
are
called
indemnity
selections
or
in
lieu
selections.
now,
this
case
concerns
a
series
of
194
such
selections
filed
by
the
state
of
utah
between
1965
and
1971.
the
selections
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
36.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
the
utah
selections
cover
about
194,
157,000
acres
in
the
northeast
portion
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
which
we've
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
brief.
in
addition
to
the
controversy
over
the
grossly
disparate
value
policy
before
the
court
today,
there
has
also
been
a
delay
associated
with
the
actual
appraisal
in
estimating
the
value
of
the
base
lands
and
the
selective
lands.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
mean,
for
one
thing
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
now
for
five
years,
so
that
takes
it
back
to
1974.
now,
that's
about
nine
years
from
the
date
of
the
beginning
selection.
but
there
was
an
intervening
event,
the
passage
of
the
national
environment
policy
act
in
1969
which
raised
the
question
about
the
applicability
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
to
a
state
indemnity
selection.
now,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
today.
to
some
extent
the
resolution
of
the
question
may
depend
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
if
the
secretary
has
the
discretion
that
he
contends
he
has,
then
his
decision
to
approve
or
disapprove
selection
may
involve
a
major
federal
action
that
would
require
an
environmental
impact
statement.
but
that
all
is
not
here
now
because
of
the
way
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
resolved
this
litigation.
so
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
the
district
value
policy
is
still
the
policy
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
you
have
to
understand
the
chronology
here.
i
mean,
in
1958,
congress
for
the
first
time
provided
that
states
could
select
mineral
land
as
a
replacement
for
lost
school
land.
that
provoked
a
ferment
within
the
department
and
the
question
arose
as
to
what,
if
any,
discretion
the
secretary
had
when
a
state
selected
lands
that
were
much
more
valuable
than
the
lands
that
they
lost.
now,
in
1963,
the
attorney
general
rendered
an
opinion
at
the
request
of
the
department
of
the
interior
stating
that
he
believed
the
secretary
had
discretion,
for
which
he
now
argues,
and
then
in
1965
the
secretary
did
support
proposed
legislation
that
would
have
added
the
equal
value
concept
to
governing
indemnity
selection
statutes.
so
it
has
been
the
department's
policy
for
at
least
14
years
now,
perhaps
15
or
16.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
first
statement
signed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
dated
january
16,
i
believe,
1967,
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
when
i
said
he
had
been
following
it
since
'63,
i
was
basing
it
on
the
fact
that
there
was
this
series
of
communications
between
representative
aspinall,
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
the
interior,
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
which
discussed
the
general
question
of
his
discretion
under
section
7
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
and
the
applicability
or
the
availability
of
that
discretion
as
a
means
of
importing
this
evaluation
policy
into
the
process
of
ruling
on
indemnity
selections.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
approximately
10,000
of
the
157,000
acres
at
issue
in
this
case
are
the
subject
of
two
prototype
oil
shale
leases
right
now,
but
those
aren't
really
involved
in
any
direct
sense
in
this
case
because
utah
has
agreed
that
it
did
not
object
to
the
leasing
program,
and
it
will
regardless
of
the
disposition
in
this
case,
it
will
honor
the
leases
in
the
event
that
it
prevails.
now,
utah
filed
this
suit
in
march
1974,
challenging
the
propriety
of
the
secretary's
grossly
disparate
value
policy,
and
that
policy
appears
in
the
memo
signed
by
secretary
udall
to
which
i
just
referred
in
the
appendix
at
pages
43
to
45.
briefly
stated,
the
secretary's
policy
is
that
in
most
cases
he'll
refuse
to
approve
state
selections
of
public
lands
that
are
substantially
more
valuable
than
the
lost
school
sections
they
are
intended
to
replace.
now,
the
policy
doesn't
come
into
play
at
all
unless
the
estimated
value
of
the
selected
lands
is
more
than
$100
per
acre.
if
it
is,
and
if
the
selected
lands
have
an
estimated
value
per
acre
higher
than
the
lost
sections,
the
secretary
will
routinely
approve
otherwise
acceptable
selections
only
where
the
difference
in
value
is
$100
per
acre
or
25
percent
of
the
value
of
the
base,
the
lost
lands,
whichever
is
greater.
so
for
example,
if
the
lost
lands
are
worth
$100
an
acre,
the
secretary
would
routinely
approve
an
otherwise
acceptable
selection
where
the
value
was
up
to
$200
an
acre.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
lost
lands
were
particularly
valuable,
say
$1,000
an
acre,
the
secretary
would
then
routinely
approve
anything
up
to
$1,250.
now,
utah
contends
that
the
secretary
simply
lacks
the
authority
to
apply
this
grossly
disparate
value
standard
to
state
indemnity
selections.
in
the
state's
view,
the
only
legitimate
criteria
for
evaluating
a
proposed
selection
are
found
in
the
statute
generally
authorizing
such
selections.
now,
that
statute
traces
its
origin
to
two
laws
enacted
in
1826
and
1859.
the
laws
were
revised
and
consolidated
in
sections
2275
and
2276
of
the
revised
statutes
in
1874,
and
then
amended
again
in
1891
and
again
in
1958.
they
are
now
in
43
usc
851
and
852.
the
secretary's
position
is
that
in
addition
to
those
provisions,
another
statute
is
highly
relevant
to
his
action
on
state
applications.
that
statute
is
the
taylor
grazing
act
of
1934,
and
in
particular
section
1
of
the
act
and
section
7,
as
amended
two
years
later
in
1936.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
at
least
that's
part
of
his
position.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
date
of
the
solicitor's
opinion
is
september
1962.
now,
that
was
a
date
earlier
than
any
i
discussed
before
in
answer
to
your
question.
it
may
have
been
that
there
were
some
lower
officials
in
the
interior
department
who
thought
in
1962
that
the
equal
value
concept
was
simply
inapplicable.
i
don't
deny
that.
we
discussed
that
memorandum
briefly
in
note
26
of
our
brief
on
page
61.
if
that
ever
did
represent
the
policy
of
the
secretary
and
the
department
as
a
whole,
it
no
longer
does.
and
to
that
extent
there
has
been
a
change.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
is
right
to
a
limited
extent.
you
have
to
talk
about
it
in
two
parts,
i
think.
the
secretary's
assertion
of
discretion
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
has
been
a
consistent
policy
since
1935,
and
that
is
the
main
and
the
broad
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today.
the
subsidiary
question,
and
the
one
on
which
there
may
have
been
this
change,
is
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
grossly
disparate
value
policy
as
an
exercise
of
that
discretion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
grossly
disparate
value
policy
as
it
is
stated
in
that
memorandum
applies
to
all
lands,
and
there
is
no
limitation
to
mineral
lands.
now,
it
is
of
course
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
possibility
for
it
is
older
than
that,
certainly,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
likelihood
that
such
a
problem
would
arise
was
substantially
increased
in
1958
with
the
congressional
decision
to
allow
states
to
select
mineral
lands.
now,
whether
in
the
period
between
1936
and
1958
the
secretary
approved
a
lot
of
selections
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
white,
my
point
is
that
between
'36
and
1958,
i
don't
know
what
every
approval
of
indemnity
selection
involved.
there
may
have
been
some
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
cannot
point
to
any
statement
of
a
grossly
disparate
value
policy
between
'36
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
as
far
as
i
know.
i
think
that
the
solicitor's
opinion
in
1962
reflected
the
general
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
that
that's
basically
true.
i
don't
think
that
there
had
ever
been
an
active
consideration
of
this
equal
value
question
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
department
had
to
act
on
individual
state
selections,
they
obviously
had
a
method
of
determining
whether
to
approve
or
disapprove.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
simply
don't
know,
because
in
the
indemnity
selection
rulings,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
discussion
of
the
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
values.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
certainly
provided
the
major
impetus,
but
i
can't
deny
that
there
may
have
been
some
indemnity
selection
before
1958
that
for
timber
or
other
reasons
involved
lands
that
were
substantially
more
valuable
than
the
lost
land.
mr.
peter
buscemi
precisely.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
i
don't.
mr.
peter
buscemi
now,
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
i
think,
as
we
have
seen,
is
the
relationship
between
the
indemnity
selection
statute
and
the
taylor
grazing
act.
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
why
we
think
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
about
that,
but
i
would
like
to
just
make
a
few
quick
preliminary
points
to
eliminate
some
extraneous
possible
questions
and
issues
in
the
case.
first
of
all,
the
utah
enabling
act
is
not
directly
involved
here
any
more
because
in
1902
congress
provided
that
the
indemnity
selections
should
take
place
under
the
general
indemnity
selection
statute,
notwithstanding
the
--
anything
to
the
contrary
that
may
have
been
in
the
enabling
act.
except
of
course
for
the
grant
of
the
original
school
sections,
the
utah
enabling
act
really
isn't
a
problem
here.
now,
secondly
i'd
like
to
say
that
under
the
original
indemnity
selection
statutes
in
1926
and
1859,
there
is
very
little
question
from
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
secretary,
originally
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
then
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
had
complete
control
over
the
indemnity
selection
process.
i
am
not
saying
that
those
old
statutes
are
dispositive
now.
a
lot
has
happened
since
then.
but
i
just
think
that
it
is
important
to
keep
that
in
mind
in
interpreting
the
subsequent
congressional
action.
now,
third,
there
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
buscemi
what
i
mean
to
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
1826
statute
said
in
i
think
so
many
words,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
because
there
was
no
secretary
of
the
interior
then,
"shall
select
the
lands
for
the
state."
now,
the
third
point
that
i
want
to
make
as
a
preliminary
matter
is
that
when
utah
joined
the
union
in
1896,
the
selection
statute
on
which
the
state
now
relies
provided
that
no
mineral
lands
could
be
selected.
for
62
years
after
utah
joined
the
union
they
simply
had
no
right
to
select
any
mineral
lands
and
indeed,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
sweet
in
1918,
even
the
original
grants
in
place
that
may
have
contained
mineral
lands
did
not
go
to
the
state
--
that
may
have
contained
minerals
did
not
go
to
the
state
if
they
did.
because
the
court
ruled
in
sweet
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
give
the
states
mineral
lands
even
if
they
fell
within
the
numbered
sections.
so
the
state's
discussion
of
the
bilateral
compact
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state,
as
if
that's
some
sort
of
binding
contract
that
gives
the
state
a
right
to
mineral
lands,
is
simply
inaccurate
on
the
historical
records.
there
was
no
right
to
mineral
lands
when
utah
joined
the
union.
now,
finally,
i
just
want
to
repeat
once
more
that
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
the
secretary's
discretion.
even
if
for
some
reason
the
mostly
disparate
value
policy
is
deemed
to
be
an
abuse
of
that
discretion,
which
we
think
it's
not,
the
major
issue
of
importance
here
is
that
the
secretary
does
have
some
discretion
under
section
7
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
to
manage
the
public
lands
that
have
been
placed
in
grazing
districts,
and
that
we
think
is
the
most
important
point.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
true
that
the
secretary
should
act
as
expeditiously
as
possible.
i
think
that
in
the
past
few
years
there
have
been
a
number
of
developments
that
have
prevented
him
from
acting
quickly.
in
the
past,
i
think
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
older
indemnity
selection
decisions
by
the
interior
department
that
were
cited,
you'll
see
that
the
selections
were
approved
more
quickly,
but
there
have
been
some
special
problems
in
the
recent
years.
now,
as
the
indemnity
selection
statute
stood
after
the
1891
amendment,
it
authorized
the
states
to
select
lands
from
any
unappropriated
surveyed
public
lands
not
mineral
in
character
within
the
state
where
the
loss
of
school
sections
had
occurred.
now,
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
role,
but
it
certainly
didn't
purport
to
change
that
role
in
any
way.
now,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
from
looking
back
at
the
old
interior
department
decisions
what
the
prevailing
assumption
was
about
the
extent
of
the
secretary's
control
over
selections
around
the
turn
of
the
century,
but
the
court
settled
that
matter
in
payne
v.
new
mexico
and
wyoming
v.
united
states.
those
cases
held
that
once
that
indemnity
selection
had
been
filed,
the
secretary
could
not
refuse
to
approve
it
because
he
had
returned
the
base
lands
to
the
public
domain,
and
thereby
given
them
back
to
the
state,
or
because
in
the
interim
while
the
selection
was
pending,
the
president
decided
he
wanted
to
withdraw
the
selected
lands.
payne
and
wyoming
said
that
the
secretary
could
not
do
that.
now,
it
is
not
necessary,
we
think,
to
reconsider
payne
or
wyoming.
we
can
accept
them
as
correctly
decided,
and
we
don't
have
to
argue
about
whether
there
was
an
error
there
because
the
court
did
not
consider
the
meaning
of
the
1826
and
1859
predecessors
to
the
1891
statute,
not
to
mention
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
well,
we
could
argue
that
they
were
incorrectly
decided
and
they
should
be,
the
court
should
not
follow
them
now,
but
we
don't
need
to
because
of
the
intervening
act,
or
the
passage
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
in
section
7.
mr.
peter
buscemi
you
mean
to
say
the
debates
in
the
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
no.
but
i
do
not
want
to
point
out,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
that
the
act
was
designed
to
create
a
new
system
for
controlling
the
public
lands
and
to
insure
the
orderly
improvement
and
development
of
those
lands
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
don't
believe
that's
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
see
any
evidence
of
that
in
the
taylor
grazing
act.
the
point
was
that
congress
was
concerned
that
this
land
not
be
let
alone
out
there
without
any
person
looking
after
it
and
watching
out
for
what
kind
of
entries
were
made
on
it.
so
it
authorized
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
to
establish
grazing
districts
and
thereby
to
withdraw
the
federal
land
included,
placed
in
those
grazing
districts,
from
all
forms
of
entry
or
settlement.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
that's
not
what
i
mean
to
say.
all
i
mean
to
say
is
the
secretary,
the
placement
of
the
land
in
the
grazing
district
was
designed
to
enable
the
secretary
to
supervise
and
watch
over
the
usage
of
that
land,
and
to
allow
entries
of
a
private
nature
or
the
state
indemnity
selection
statutes
or
state
indemnity
selection
applications
or
anything
else,
only
when
he
deemed
it
proper.
now,
section
1
of
the
act
makes
it
absolutely
plain
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
without
any
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
said
that
the
creation
of
the
districts
withdrew
all
the
affected
lands
from
all
forms
of
entry
or
settlement.
now,
utah
contends
that
state
indemnity
selection
is
not
a
form
of
entry
or
settlement.
but
that
can't
be,
because
we
know
from
this
court's
decisions
in
wyoming
v.
united
states
and
the
later
case,
united
states
v.
wyoming,
that
a
pickett
act
withdrawal
by
the
president,
which
withdraws
public
lands
from,
quote,
"settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry,"
can
defeat
a
state
indemnity
selection.
the
pickett
act
says
nothing
about
indemnity
selection,
nor
do
most
executive
orders
withdrawing
public
lands
under
the
authority
of
the
act.
but
nonetheless,
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
state
indemnity
selection,
indeed
even
the
original
grant
which
was
involved
in
united
states
v.
wyoming,
the
1947
case,
is
defeated
if
the
pickett
act
withdrawal
occurs
before
the
selection
or,
in
the
case
of
the
original
section,
before
it
has
been
surveyed.
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
that
i
remember,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
now,
utah
complains
that
we
haven't
cited
any
legislative
history
of
the
kind
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggests,
that
placement
of
public
lands
in
a
grazing
district
specifically
renders
them
unavailable
for
school
selection.
but
in
light
of
the
structure
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
its
wording,
it
should
be
incumbent
on
the
state
to
demonstrate
that
a
particular
form
of
entry
was
deliberately
exempted
from
the
withdrawal
effected
by
the
creation
of
a
grazing
district.
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
when
congress
said
"all
forms
of
entry
or
settlement,"
it
didn't
stop
to
specify
each
kind
of
entry
that
was
covered.
they
are
all
covered.
now,
moreover
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
understood
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
to
concern
the
legislative
history
of
the
'34
act
at
the
time
it
was
adopted.
the
1958
report
to
which
you
refer
on
page
55
comes
considerably
thereafter,
although
we
definitely
argue
and
think
that
it
reflects
congressional
approval
of
the
secretary's
discretion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
that's
true.
now,
this
brings
us
to
section
7
of
the
act,
which
i
just
want
to
address
briefly
before
reserving
the
remainder
of
my
time.
now,
we
say
that
when
congress
saw
what
it
had
done
in
1934
and
realized
that
all
of
the
land
placed
in
a
grazing
district
had
been
withdrawn
from
all
forms
of
entry
or
settlement,
when
it
looked
at
that
in
combination
with
the
executive
order
of
november
1934,
withdrawing
all
public
lands
in
12
of
the
western
states
from
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
under
the
pickett
act,
it
realized
that
this
public
land
was
simply
unavailable.
now,
the
senate
hearings
on
the
amendment
of
section
7
in
1936
make
this
absolutely
plain
that
this
is
what
they
were
concerned
about.
they
knew
that
they
had
simply
precluded
all
forms
of
entry,
and
that's
why
they
amended
section
7.
and
in
the
amendment
--
before,
in
the
original
statute,
section
7
had
allowed
the
secretary
to
open
grazing
district
lands
to
homesteading.
so
in
the
amendment,
congress
simply
expanded
the
secretary's
discretion
and
said,
"now
you
can
open
them
to
any
form
of
entry
if
you
find
that
the
particular
land
is
proper
for
acquisition
in
satisfaction
of
an
outstanding
lieu
right
or
land
grant
or
any
one
of
a
number
of
other
things
that
are
listed
in
section
7."
now,
section
7
as
it
stands
today
makes
it
absolutely
clear.
it
says
that
the
grazing
district
lands
should
not
be
subject
to
disposition,
settlement,
or
occupation
until
classified
and
open
to
entry.
and
it
authorizes
the
secretary
to
make
those
classifications.
now,
we
have
canvassed
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it
here,
but
it
demonstrates
that
this
sort
of
entry
is
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
the
1958
amendment
didn't
do
anything
to
change
that.
it
simply
said
that
mineral
lands
are
now
available
on
the
same
terms
that
other
lands
would
have
been
available,
and
that
meant
that
congress
had
to
classify
them
for
entry,
excuse
me,
that
the
secretary
had
to
classify
them
under
section
7.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
two
quick
points.
the
first
is
that
the
state
of
utah
relies
heavily
on
the
language
of
section
1
of
the
act
to
demonstrate,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
before
in
the
question
he
asked
me,
that
the
act
is
simply
not
applicable
to
school
indemnity
selections.
that
language
is
reprinted
on
page
35
of
our
brief.
it
says
that
the
secretary's
establishment
of
grazing
districts
shall
not
affect
any
land
heretofore
or
hereafter
surveyed
which
except
for
the
provisions
of
this
act
would
be
a
part
of
any
grant
to
any
state.
mr.
dewsnup
has
suggested
that
the
school
indemnity
selection
would
be
a
part
of
the
grant
to
a
state
and
therefore
this
act
does
not
apply,
but
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
that
provision
in
section
1
was
added
to
indicate
that
utah
would
retain
its
unsurveyed
but
enumerated
school
sections,
notwithstanding
the
creation
of
a
grazing
district.
senator
wagner
said
to
the
assistant
solicitor
of
the
department,
"mr.
poole,
we'd
like
to
have
to
give
us
a
detailed
explanation
of
the
bill,"
and
then
mr.
poole
started
going
through
the
bill,
and
he
said,
"now,
on
page
2,
referring
to
this
provision,
protection
is
given
to
prior
valid
rights
of
private
individuals
or
entries
such
as
grants
to
railroads,
unperfected
homestead
entries,
and
settlement
rights,
and
also
unsurveyed
school
sections."
that
is
stated
generally.
and
the
land
commissioner
of
arizona
who
testified
later
in
the
same
senate
hearing
said
the
same
thing.
"in
the
state
of
arizona
we
have
approximately
six
and
a
half
million
acres
of
unsurveyed
land
and
750,000
acres
of
those
are
school
sections
which
under
the
terms
of
the
enabling
act
should,
when
and
if
surveyed,
become
the
property
of
the
state
of
arizona."
"i
notice
that
the
house
bill
has
been
amended
in
an
attempt
to
safeguard
and
to
finally
bring
to
the
state
those
particular
sections."
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"but
i
think
the
amendment
has
been
inadequate,"
because
he
wants
to
be
protected
for
the
school
indemnity
selections
as
well.
but
no
further
change
was
made.
the
only
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honors,
is
that
section
8
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
which
counsel
has
relied
on,
as
just
purely
a
point
of
information
for
the
court,
has
now
been
repealed
by
the
federal
land
policy
and
management
act
of
1976.
that's
found
at
90
stat
2792.
for
the
reasons
i've
stated
here
and
in
the
brief,
we
think
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
your
honor's
question
is
leading
to.
mr.
peter
buscemi
oh.
there
is,
as
we
have
said
in
the
reply
brief,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
of
the
secretary
trying
to
extinguish
the
state's
rights
to
indemnity
selections.
i
mean,
that
is
purely
a
red
herring.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
withdrawal
has
occurred.
but
the
question
is,
could
the
secretary
refuse
to
classify
any
lands
and
thereby
defeat
all
of
the
indemnity
selection
rights
and
we
have
never
argued
that
he
could.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
mean,
i've
stated
before,
and
i
think
that
delay
is
a
bit
overstated
here,
but
in
any
event,
the
state,
if
the
secretary
simply
refused
to
act
on
an
application,
which
is
not
the
allegation
in
this
case
and
the
state
is
not
complaining
about
the
secretary's
refusal
to
act,
it's
complaining
about
the
basis,
the
stated
basis
for
the
secretary's
action
when
it
comes.
but
if
there
is
a
problem
with
unnecessary
delay,
i
presume
that
there
could
be
a
lawsuit
to
mandamus
the
secretary
to
perform
his
classification
duty,
in
the
same
way
that
there
had
been
a
series
of
lawsuits
under
the
social
security
act,
for
example,
to
compel
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
act
on
social
security
applications.
thank
you.
