justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
didn't
get
the
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then,
how
long
has
he
been
following
formally
the
equal
value
concept?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
mineral
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
there
ever
was
a
policy
the
other
way,
that's
contrary
to
what
you're
now
pushing,
it
was
only
between
'58
and
'62?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
then,
because
that's
when
they
first
began
hassling
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
a
policy
during
that
time
that
you
can
point
to,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
solicitor
in
1962
stated
a
position
that
you
don't
now
agree
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
had
that
been
a
policy
of
the
department?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
first
time
that
anybody
in
the
department
had
really
said
anything
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
wasn't
any
policy
in
the
department
prior
to
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
a
policy
to
be
formulated
until
1958
when
mineral
lands
could
first
be
used
in
the
in
lieu
of
selection.
justice
byron
r.
white
should
be
the
fertility
of
the
land;
i
mean
desert
land
against
very
fertile
farmland.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
never
formalized,
whatever
the
policy
was,
if
there
was
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
with
the
house
report
you
cite
on
page
55
and
56
of
your
brief?
is
that
not
in
point,
or
not?
you
certainly
think
that
there
is
congressional
affirmation
of
the
secretary's
role
in
selecting
lieu
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
in
connection
with
amendments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
describe
utah
as
though
it
were
like
some
other
states
i
can
think
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
house
interior
committee
knew
what
the
secretary
was
doing,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
staff
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
for
example,
knew
how
this
was
being
administered?
