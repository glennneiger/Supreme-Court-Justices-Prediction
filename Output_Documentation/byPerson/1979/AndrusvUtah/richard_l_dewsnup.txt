mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
or
two
responses
i
would
like
to
make
briefly
to
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised,
before
i
move
into
my
argument.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
whether
wyoming
v.
united
states
in
1921
or
united
states
v.
wyoming
in
1947
had
made
any
distinction
between
the
type
of
reservation
withdrawal.
the
court
didn't,
but
the
court
had
before
it
withdrawal
for
federal
purpose
in
putting
it
in
federal
forest
reserve
for
use
as
a
federal
purpose.
while
the
government
consistently
states
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
any
withdrawal
will
be
sufficient
to
defeat
a
state
indemnity
selection,
that
is
not
true.
there
is
not
one
word
anywhere
in
any
decided
case
that
we're
aware
of
or
any
implication
or
suggestion
that
lands
not
withdrawn
for
federal
use,
that
is
land
simply
withdrawn
for
classification
without
any
determination
as
to
what
uses
they
would
be
put
to,
because
the
1930
withdrawal
order,
executive
order
1532,
i
believe
it
was,
in
1930,
withdrew
every
inch
of
the
land
in
seven
or
eight
western
states,
including
all
of
utah,
for
classification.
i
am
sorry,
that
was
the
oil
shale
withdrawal.
but
in
1935
withdrew
every
acre
for
classification
and
since
1935,
that
executive
order
has
continuously
been
in
effect,
and
today
every
inch
of
the
state
of
utah
is
in
a
taylor
grazing
district.
my
house
is
in
a
taylor
grazing
district.
the
utah
state
capitol
is
in
a
taylor
grazing
district.
so
that
about
one-half
of
utah
is
unreserved
public
domain
for
no
particular
public
use,
whereas
the
forests,
the
parks,
and
areas
reserved
for
public
use,
we
admit
we
can't
select
that.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
utah
had
a
particular
problem
in
that
utah
was
settled
50
years
before
statehood
was
granted
because
of
polygamy
and
other
problems
that
delayed
it.
the
practical
effect
of
this
is
that
the
homestead
laws
and
other
laws
caused
the
farms
to
be
established
where
water
was
available,
forests
were
reserved.
the
only
things
that
were
left
by
1896
basically
were
the
wastelands
where
water
wasn't
available,
the
alpine
forests
weren't
there,
and
that
meant
we
not
only
didn't
get
our
original
grants
in
place,
these
more
desirable
areas,
but
the
lands
from
which
we
could
select
were
likewise
limited
to
the
wastelands.
now,
it
happens
that
we
believe
that
there
are
oil
shale
deposits
in
part
of
the
barren
desert
out
in
uwinah
county
and
we've
made
filings
on
those.
but
i
simply
want
to
repeat
that
despite
the
government's
claims,
and
maybe
mr.
buscemi
will
come
up
with
something
he
hasn't
done
yet,
there
is
no
indication
that
federal
lands,
the
unreserved
public
domain
withdrawn
simply
for
classification
will
defeat
school
indemnity
selection.
then,
in
response
to
a
question
or
comment
from
mr.
justice
white
about
congressional
acquiescence,
my
comment
is,
to
the
extent
there
was
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
secretary's
classification
procedure,
it
was
a
perfunctory
thing.
there
wasn't
a
word
of
debate
during
the
amendments
of
43
usc
852.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
i
doubt
it.
there
was
no
amplification
within
the
secretary's
report.
roger
ernst
from
arizona
wrote
one
of
those
reports.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
with
respect
to
school
indemnity
selection,
there
is
not
any
kind
of
explanation
or
amplification
at
all,
and
if
they
did,
there
is
no
indication,
not
one
word
of
debate
or
discussion
that
congress
focused
on
that
issue,
that
was
not
an
issue
of
the
legislation.
but
more
importantly,
classification
was
not
controversial.
despite
what's
been
said,
it
was
always
on
acre
for
acre
basis,
and
there
has
not
to
this
day
--
and
we
repeatedly
for
the
last
five
years
have
asked
interior
--
has
there
ever
been
an
instance
where
there's
been
an
equal
value
criterion
applied
to
school
indemnity
selection,
and
there
has
not.
in
fact,
on
february
14,
1974,
when
secretary
morton
wrote
to
governor
ramp
and
he
said,
"one
of
my
main
problems
in
that
i
haven't
acted
on
these
indemnity
selections
is
that
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
i
can
use
the
equal
value
criterion,
but
that
was
a
policy
established
by
secretary
udall
in
1967,
and
when
i
got
around
to
doing
something
about
your
school
indemnity
selection,
i
intend
to
apply
that
policy."
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
the
equal
value
policy.
that's
why
i
think
its
highly
misleading
for
this
40
years
of
continuous
administrative
practice.
it
was
relatively
noncontroversial
because
whatever
classification
might
have
consisted
of,
it
was
essentially
applying
the
criteria
of
section
852
of
title
43,
which
is
the
applicable
public
land
for
school
indemnity
selections.
so
if
there
has
been
any
congressional
acquiescence
that's
relevant,
it
is
acquiescence
in
a
classification
process
which
utilized
the
criteria
of
section
852.
now,
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
mention
that
the
11
western
states,
continental
western
states,
are
all
before
the
court.
utah,
of
course,
the
primary
party;
the
state
of
idaho
filed
a
separate
amicus
brief;
the
state
of
california
with
eight
other
states
also
filed
an
amicus
brief
jointly.
all
11
states
present
a
uniform
position
before
this
court
in
accordance
with
the
position
of
the
state
of
utah
and
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
10th
circuit
below.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
that
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
of
the
united
states
gives
too
short
a
shrift
of
the
purpose
of
the
school
indemnity
land
grants.
in
the
western
states,
and
the
state
of
utah
is
still
67
percent
owned
by
the
united
states,
the
property
tax
is
a
basic
tax
for
supporting
fundamental
governmental
purposes
and
the
most
important,
dollar-wise,
is
support
of
the
public
schools.
the
state
of
virginia
or
maryland
as
original
states
could
tax
virtually
100
percent
of
the
property.
the
state
of
utah
couldn't.
it
had
to
forego
as
a
condition
of
statehood
any
taxation
of
federal
or
indian
lands.
as
a
quid
pro
quo
created
by
bilateral
compact,
the
united
states
agreed
to
grant
to
the
state
of
utah
for
the
support
of
the
common
schools
certain
lands
in
consideration
for
the
state
not
taxing
federal
and
indian
lands.
and
so
this
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
governmental
purposes.
the
state
is
to
derive
from
this
school
land
grant
revenues
to
compensate
it
for
the
tax
it
otherwise
would
have
received
from
the
general
property
taxing
power
over
federal
and
indian
lands.
and
that's
why
in
section
6
of
the
utah
enabling
act,
congress
says,
"whenever
you
don't
get
these
original
sections
in
place"
--
and
the
reason
utah
and
arizona
and
new
mexico
got
for
section
is
because
they're
desert
states
and
so
much
of
the
area
was
marginal
or
wasteland
--
"other
lands
equivalent
thereto
to
the
original
sections
in
place
could
be
selected,"
and
said,
"other
lands
appointed
thereto
are
hereby
appropriated
for
the
state
to
select
in
such
manner
as
the
state
legislature
may
direct,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary."
and
as
the
wyoming
and
new
mexico
cases
pointed
out,
that
approval
is
a
ministerial
function
to
see
whether
or
not
the
statutory
criteria
that
congress
set
up
in
section
852
of
title
43
have
been
satisfied.
that
is,
have
you
identified
appropriate
base
lands?
if
you're
selecting
mineral
lands,
the
base
land
is
mineral
in
character.
if
you're
selecting
lands
on
a
producing
oil
and
gas
field,
were
your
lands
in
place
similarly
producing
oil
and
gas.
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
observe
that
with
respect
to
this
equal
value,
congress
has
made
the
determination
as
to
what
is
fair
and
what
is
not
fair.
congress
in
about
two
pages
that
we
have
cited,
section
852,
has
carefully
laid
out
the
balances
of
what
it
considered
to
be
a
fair
compensation
in
school
indemnity
selections,
and
there
is
no
way
that
utah,
speaking
of
fairness,
it's
unlikely
that
utah
will
ever
get
a
true
cross
section
of
land
within
its
borders
as
was
originally
envisioned.
nor
will
this
case
have
any
great
substantial
adverse
impact
in
any
way
upon
federal
lands
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
management;
if
all
seven
states
still
having
indemnity
selection
rights
left
exercise
those
rights,
a
totality
combined
acreage
of
all
seven
states
would
amount
to
less
than
one
percent
of
the
federal
land
in
utah
alone.
and
even
on
the
oil
shale
resources
we
pointed
out,
the
land
that
utah's
applied
for
here
are
only
a
fraction
of
one
percent
of
that
resource,
so
it's
not
as
though
utah
would
in
any
event
obtain
some
lion's
share
or
even
significant
part
of
that
resource.
with
respect
to
the
equal
value
concept
further,
i
have
said
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
never
to
our
knowledge,
or
he
has
not
disclosed
at
any
time
despite
requests,
that
this
equal
value
concept
has
ever
been
applied
in
any
particular
case
or
instance.
i
mention
briefly
the
utah
enabling
act
said
other
lands
of
equal
acreage,
title
43
usc
section
851,
making
the
general
appropriation
of
lands
for
indemnity
selection
says
that
lands
of
equal
acreage
are
hereby
appropriated.
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
the
discussion
of
equal
acreage
is
not
equal
value,
and
it
was
not
until
1967
this
doctrine
or
policy
of
secretary
udall
finally
was
formulated
and
even
then,
it
was
very
strange
that
it
was
never
really
promulgated.
it
wasn't
published
anywhere.
it
wasn't
in
the
federal
register.
it
wasn't
sent
out
by
way
of
instruction
sheets,
and
in
1976
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
decided
new
mexico
decision
and
some
reference
to
that
udall
memorandum
had
been
made
and
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
said
that
this
so-called
memorandum
we've
never
heard
of
and
we
haven't
even
been
able
to
find
it.
so
it
wasn't
very
well
known
in
the
interior
department
itself.
we've
cited
that
case
in
our
brief.
now,
i
think
that
new
mexico
and
wyoming
decisions
which
came
along
in
1921
are
so
clear
and
so
dispositive,
i'm
sure
the
court
through
reading
of
the
brief
and
reading
of
the
10th
circuit
court
opinion
below
are
just
absolutely
on
point,
and
the
government
concedes
that
but
claims
that
somehow
this
taylor
grazing
act
enacted
in
1934
and
invented
in
1936,
without
saying
one
word
about
it,
emasculated
this
whole
school
indemnity
land
grant,
this
sole
and
bilateral
compact,
as
this
court
has
said
and
the
10th
circuit
court
has
said,
between
two
sovereigns
to
permit
the
public
land
states
to
carry
on
fundamental
and
essential
governmental
purposes.
i
would
like
briefly
to
run
through,
simply
by
identification,
a
few
of
the
arguments
that
we
made
in
a
brief
that
the
government
has
criticized
as
being
too
long.
we
don't
think
any
parts
of
the
brief
are
unnecessary.
we
think
there
is
just
so
much
evidence
in
support
of
our
position
that
it
took
100
pages
to
say
it.
first
of
all,
section
1
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
contains
an
express
exemption
that
the
act
will
not
apply
to
any
part
of
any
grant
to
any
state.
the
government's
response
to
that
is
that
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
the
original
grants
in
place
of
the
school
land
grant,
section
216
32
and
36
in
the
case
of
utah,
but
not
to
indemnity
selection.
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
justify
any
such
intent
to
make
such
a
limited
exception,
and
besides
the
land
grant,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
unity,
it's
indivisible.
if
utah
is
granted
section
2,
and
that's
a
land
grant
to
the
state,
and
we
don't
get
a
part
of
that
grant
as
our
indemnity
selection,
we
get
section
2
or
we
get
to
select
land
and
that
satisfies
our
section
2
school
land
grant.
and
i
think
that
is
a
fanciful
argument.
in
fact,
i
admire
the
way
the
government
at
this
juncture,
and
their
theory
has
evolved
during
the
five
years
we've
been
litigating,
they
have
now
sutured
together
a
rather
plausible
superficial
case
of
what
might
have
happened
in
the
past.
but
i
submit
that
the
arguments
are
constructed
after
the
fact
and
ignore
the
basic
nature
and
purpose
and
importance
of
the
school
land
grants.
second,
when
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
amended
in
1936,
the
discussion
in
the
senate
committee
report
clearly
said
that
we're
doing
this
to
facilitate
private
entries,
classification
for
disposition
of
the
public
domain
through
private
entries.
this
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
exemption
in
section
1
that
any
part
of
any
grant
to
any
state
is
not
included,
and
the
amendment
in
1936
was
identified
as
applying
to
private
entries.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
a
taylor
grazing
lease
an
entry?
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
no.
i
think
that
would
not
be
an
entry.
a
typical
entry
i
think
would
be
under
homestead
laws,
under
mining
laws,
those
kinds
of
--
i
am
not
sure
i
fully
appreciate
the
question.
the
administration
of
the
act
and
the
granting
of
grazing
allotments,
they
are
tantamount
to
leasing,
if
you're
talking
about
the
grazing
uses
as
certain
allotments
are
made
to
certain
users
within
a
particular
grazing
district
to
graze
so
many
cattle
during
so
many
periods
of
time.
i
would
not
refer
to
that
as
an
entry,
because
these
entries
were
to
be
compared
with
the
alternative
entry
use.
if
someone
made
an
entry
and
that
entry
was
more
valuable
for
the
purpose
of
the
entry
than
for
grazing
native
forage,
then
the
secretary
would
dispose,
or
was
authorized
to
dispose
of
the
land
for
purposes
of
the
entry,
to
classify
that
for
disposition.
i
would
like
to
mention
at
this
juncture
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
sets
forth
specific
criteria
for
a
particular
type
of
entry.
if
you
make
a
homestead
entry,
you're
entitled
to
complete
the
entry,
if
you
can
prove
that
the
agricultural
use
of
the
land
is
more
valuable
than
the
grazing.
if
someone
wants
to
make
a
private
trade
of
land,
even
if
there's
to
be
a
state
trade
as
distinguished
from
indemnity
selection
--
i'm
going
to
elaborate
on
that
a
little
bit
more
in
just
a
second
--
then
there
are
elaborate
criteria.
but
if
school
indemnity
selection
were
to
be
included,
they're
exempt
from
the
act,
there
is
no
indication
they're
included,
there's
not
one
word
about
it.
this
would
be
the
only
kind
of
classification
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
where
the
secretary
would
be
free
of
any
guiding
criteria.
the
most
fundamental
important
use
of
the
land,
the
exercise
by
the
state
of
that
indemnity
right,
the
secretary
would
be
totally
free.
we've
said
that
there
would
be
no
judicial
review
because
that
would
be
under
the
secretary
view
agency
discretion
committed
by
law
to
the
agency,
which
under
overton
park
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
solicitor
responded
in
a
reply
brief
we
just
got
last
night,
delivered
to
our
hotel
--
we're
thankful
for
that
--
saying
yes,
there
would,
but
he
cites
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
i
think
that's
highly
unlikely.
very
briefly,
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
that
come
anywhere
near
having
relevance
are
discussed
beginning
on
page
93
of
our
brief,
and
i
think
the
significant
thing
is,
in
every
case
they
have
distinguished
the
wyoming
and
payne
cases,
because
none
of
the
cases
decided
have
dealt
with
school
indemnity
selections,
as
having
been
decided
under
other
statutes.
there
is
not
the
slightest
word
or
suggestion
in
any
of
these
cases
that
payne
and
wyoming
are
no
longer
good
law,
and
while
these
are
lower
court
decisions,
none
of
those
cases
were
decided
by
this
court,
none
of
the
cases
subsequent
to
payne
and
wyoming.
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
comparison
to
exchanges.
now,
an
exchange
of
course
is
when
the
state
simply
wants
to
make
a
trade.
it
has
a
right
of
selection
when
it
doesn't
get
its
original
grants
in
place.
but
if
it
does
get
its
original
grants
in
place,
it
can
still
ask
the
federal
government
to
trade,
and
those
trades
are
covered
under
section
8
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
and
they
are
discussed
separately,
and
there
the
secretary
is
given
authority
to
approve
an
exchange
either
on
the
basis
of
equal
acreage
or
equal
value.
now,
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
for
just
land
trades
to
be
exempt
from
classification,
and
under
the
secretary's
own
regulation,
exchanges
are
clearly
exempt.
he
does
not
classify
under
section
7,
and
yet
to
draw
a
school
indemnity
selection
in
by
the
heels
and
claim
that
they
have
to
be
classified
and
under
the
guise
of
the
classification,
the
secretary
can
reject
the
selection
for
whatever
reason
he
might
think
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
another
interesting
thing
about
exchanges
is,
section
8(c)
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
makes
it
mandatory.
the
secretary
is
told
when
the
state
selects
land
for
an
exchange,
the
secretary
will
proceed
forthwith
and
accomplish
the
exchange.
the
school
indemnity
selection
which
the
secretary
again
tries
to
drag
in
by
the
heels
in
the
classification
process,
he
says
he
not
only
doesn't
have
to
approve
the
exchange,
he
doesn't
have
to
proceed
with
all
reasonable
dispatch.
the
whole
thing
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
exchanges
somehow
would
receive
such
careful
treatment
and
consideration
by
congress
while
indemnity
selection
wouldn't.
and
the
reason
for
that,
of
course,
is
indemnity
selections
were
exempt,
exchanges
were
not,
because
they're
not
a
part
of
a
grant
to
any
state.
they
are
simply
a
request
by
a
state
for
a
trade,
and
even
there,
the
1935
act
which
received
a
pocket
veto,
and
the
legislative
history
of
which
is
discussed
at
some
length,
because
the
government
brought
it
up
--
the
only
legislative
history
they
could
find
is
in
an
act
that
didn't
become
law
--
we
responded
to
it
that
states
were
really
upset
because
under
the
1934
act,
while
there
was
an
exemption
for
any
grant
to
any
state,
it
did
not
appear
to
exempt
exchanges
or
trades
that
the
state
wanted
to
make,
so
in
1936
congress
did
that.
it
made
exchanges
exempt,
told
the
secretary
to
get
off
his
tail
and
accomplish
the
exchanges,
and
let
him
do
it
either
on
the
basis
of
equal
acreage
or
equal
value.
briefly,
we've
said
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
avoid
doubt
as
to
its
constitutionality
because
of
the
implication
of
this
bilateral
compact.
in
the
brief
we
received
last
night
the
secretary
said
that's
not
so
because
at
the
time
of
the
bilateral
compact,
the
state
was
not
entitled
to
mineral
lands,
but
it
has
been
brought
out
in
this
discussion,
this
udall
memorandum
policy
is
not
limited
to
mineral
lands.
what
he
is
trying
to
do
on
the
basis
of
equal
value
would
apply
whether
or
not
the
selections
were
mineral
or
non-mineral
lands.
so
that
doesn't
make
much
sense.
and
another
significant
and
telling
point,
and
i
think
almost
as
conclusive
as
the
other
arguments,
is
under
the
taylor
taylor
grazing
act
the
secretary
has
no
authority
at
all
to
classify
the
mineral
estate
for
disposition.
and
i
would
like
to
hear
an
argument
to
that.
we
can
make
the
argument;
we
never
get
a
response
to
it.
that's
limited
exclusively
to
surface
uses,
and
the
mineral
estate,
except
for
private
entries
under
the
hard
rock
minerals,
the
hydrocarbons,
were
reserved
from
any
kind
of
disposition
in
1920
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
are
subject
to
mineral
leases.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes.
and
the
executive
order
of
1930
which
withdrew
oil
shale
from
leasing,
that's
the
only
way
it
could
be
disposed
of,
in
1958
was
lifted
and
congress
specifically
said
that
the
states
can
now
select
lands
containing
oil
shale,
and
the
united
states
has
contrived
a
fantastically
sophisticated
argument
here
that
i
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
identify,
but
the
gist
of
it
would
be
that
congress
was
so
perceptive
that
it
decided
to
say
that
the
states
could
select
oil
shale
lands
but
congress
really
didn't
mean
that
because
in
removing,
eliminating
the
effect
of
the
1930
executive
order,
congress
without
saying
so
intended
to
leave
two
other
barriers,
and
one
was
the
withdrawal
of
executive
order
6910
in
1934,
which
withdrew
all
the
lands
for
classification,
but
then
that
was
amended
so
that
any
land
within
a
grazing
district,
so
long
as
it
remained
within
a
grazing
district,
would
be
exempt
from
that
withdrawal,
so
the
only
hurdle
we
have
left
is
section
7
requiring
classification,
and
so
the
secretary
first
can
decide
whether
or
not
he
classifies,
and
if
he
doesn't
classify
for
school
indemnity
selection,
the
express
mandate
of
congress
is
cut
off
at
the
pass.
congress
didn't
say
a
word
about
it,
but
the
government
has
sutured
together
this
theory
that
congress
really
intended
exactly
the
reverse
of
what
it
said.
a
final
point
we
make,
well,
a
final
point
i'm
going
to
comment
on
for
this
brief,
as
the
court
said
in
wyoming
v.
united
states,
ordinarily
public
land
grant
statutes
are
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
government.
you
don't
grant
anything,
you
don't
approve
anything
that
congress
didn't
specifically
declare,
but
in
the
case
of
school
indemnity
selection
grants,
the
reverse
is
true.
this
is
such
a
fundamental
trust
program
created
by
bilateral
compact
that
the
intent
is
to
do
everything
you
can
to
give
reasonable
substance
and
support
and
effect
to
the
creation
of
the
public
trust,
and
therefore
you
construe
the
grant
liberally,
construe
any
question,
statutes
questions
of
grants
liberally
for
the
purpose
of
fulfilling
the
public
trust.
now,
as
i
say,
last
night
i
got
a
12-page
brief.
we
filed
our
hundred
page
brief,
which
we
hope
is
not
too
repetitious,
about
two
months
ago.
last
night
we
got
a
12-page
response
--
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
october
9.
maybe
this
is
on
december
first,
we
received
it
yesterday;
it's
undated.
but
it
raises
seven
--
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
oh,
fine;
i
appreciate
that
for
clarification
and
identification.
but
the
thing
that
pleases
me
is
that
the
government
hasn't
laid
a
glove
on
us,
in
my
judgment,
in
the
seven
points
that
they
have
picked
and
choose
to
respond
to
in
the
60-day
interim
since
we
filed
our
brief.
i
have
about
four
minutes
left.
i
have
a
white
light
here.
i
have
a
timekeeper
here.
i
want
to
mention
these
seven
points
that
are
shots
at
what
are
presumed
to
be
the
vulnerable
points
of
our
position.
number
one,
the
government
says
that
utah
argues
that
the
exemption
of
section
1
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
applies
only
to
grants
in
place,
and
i
have
already
--
but
there
is
no
discussion
at
all
as
to
how
you
can
sever
or
distinguish
the
indemnity
right
to
replace
the
lost
land
with
indemnity
selection,
nor
is
there
any
legislative
history
purporting
to
make
that
distinction.
number
two,
the
government
criticizes
utah
for
discussing
the
legislative
history
of
the
1935
statute
that
passed
but
did
not
become
law
because
it
had
a
pocket
veto.
we
admit
that
that
had
marginal
or
no
relevance,
but
we
responded
only
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
raised
that
for
the
first
time
ever
in
this
litigation
in
their
appellant's
brief.
the
third
argument,
the
government
argues
that
the
use
of
the
word
"private
entries"
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1936
amendment
really
can
be
construed
to
include
state
indemnity
selections
as
well.
and
there
is
a
reference
to
the
word
"selected"
or
school
selection
by
senatory
hayden
in
the
1935
act.
but
a
careful
reading
of
that
indicates
that
the
probability
that
he
was
talking
about
a
selection
for
exchange,
when
the
state
decides
it
wants
to
trade
this
piece
for
that,
it's
selecting
the
piece
it
wants
to
trade
for.
you've
got
to
be
careful
in
selection
we
mean
either
a
selection
for
a
trade
or
a
selection
for
school
indemnity.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
i
am
referring
here
simply
to
a
response
by
senator
hayden
to
attorney
richard
page
in
the
june
35
19
hearings,
to
a
statute
that
received
a
pocket
veto
and
never
became
law.
that's
pretty
far
out,
but
it's
as
close
as
the
government's
been
able
to
come
on
any
legislative
history.
point
four,
and
this
is
a
very
important
point
that
i
should
have
emphasized
in
my
argument;
i
didn't.
if
there
is
to
be
classification,
then
it
should
be
limited
to
the
kind
of
classification
the
secretaries
always
perform,
and
that
is
the
criterion,
section
852.
now,
in
response
to
that
argument
the
government
simply
says
utah
ignores
the
secretary's
independent
classification
authority
under
section
7.
that
just
simply
begs
the
question
that
he's
got
independent
classification
authority,
and
even
if
he
does,
there
is
no
response
here
as
to
why
that,
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
is
not
limited
to
the
criteria
congress
has
set
forth
in
section
853.
number
five,
and
i
mentioned
this
before,
the
secretary,
or
the
government,
argues
that
there
would
in
fact
be
judicial
review
of
classification
decisions
if
it
were
arbitrary,
unreasonable.
we've
said
overton
park
--
that's
just
inconsistent
with
overton
park.
i
see
the
red
and
i'm
in
the
process
of
sitting
down.
number
six
says
there's
no
constitutional
issue
because
we
did
not
get
minerals
at
the
time
of
the
bilateral
compact,
but
the
government's
new
value
policy
is
not
limited
to
mineral
exchanges.
and
section
7
simply
attempts
to
rehabilitate
the
origin
of
the
comparative
value
criterion.
and
i
think
we
have
shown
that
that
is
a
very
murky
strange
legislative
history.
i
thank
you
very
much.
i
am
sorry
for
the
extra
15
seconds.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
that's
an
adequate
quid
pro
quo.
thank
you.
