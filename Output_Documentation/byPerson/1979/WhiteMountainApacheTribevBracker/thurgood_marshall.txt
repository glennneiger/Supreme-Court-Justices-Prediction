justice

take
a
big
farm.
could
you
tax
the
transportation
of
the
farm
material
from
one
end
of
the
farm
to
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
theory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
thoroughly
confused,
because
you
said
that
some
state
roads
are
used,
some
local
roads
are
used,
and
i
guess
some
are
hybrid.
i
didn't
get
it
from
either
one
the
two,
so
why
don't
you
tell
me
what
roads
are
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
bia
roads
and
farmer
brown's
roads,
in
my
hypothetical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
if
farmer
brown
says
anybody
wants
to
use
those
roads,
if
he
used
it
he
would
be
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wake,
you
can
accept
that,
but
i,
for
one,
can't
accept
what
that
man
there
told
you
at
lunch.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
we
have
before
us
that
i
can
cite
myself
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
they
are
public
roads.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
they
are
public
roads.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
says
it
is
public
because
bia
made
it
public.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
is
a
public
road
in
the
state
of
arizona
not
subject
to
public
taxation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
it
is
a
state
highway,
that
is
land
that
has
been
ceded
and
it
no
longer
belongs
to
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
the
difference.
