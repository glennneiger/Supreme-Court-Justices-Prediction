justice
john
paul
stevens
you
then
would
just
draw
the
empirical
line
i
take
it
that
if
--
between
a
tribal
transportation
operation
and
a
non-tribal
transportation
operation.
i
suppose
if
you
win
this
case
and
then
the
tribe
liquidates
pinetop
and
operates
itself,
the
transportation
owns
the
trucks
and
operates,
that
you
wouldn't
tax
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
interrupting
at
a
good
time.
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
everything,
your
entire
response
to
justice
marshall.
you
said
there
were
different
kinds
of
roads
on
the
reservation.
one
was
the
state
roads,
and
everybody
agrees
taxes
are
paid
on
the
use
of
those.
the
other
was
the
bia
roads.
are
there
also
roads
that
are
not
public
highways
at
all
that
are
involved,
such
as
roads
going
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
asserting
the
right
to
tax
on
those
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you
again,
if
i
may.
the
fight
is
over
the
use
of
tribal
roads.
that
is
where
you
are
really
in
dispute,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
bia
roads
--
i
mean
bia
roads.
i
am
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
are
public
roads
but
under
the
arizona
supreme
court's
opinion
it
is
broad
enough
to
cover
those
roads
even
if
they
weren't
public
roads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
you
don't
defend
that
position.
i
thought
reading
the
opinion,
i
thought
it
would
apply
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
defend
that
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
meant
to
say
is
your
real
fight
is
over
the
right
to
tax
on
bia
roads.
does
the
record
tell
us
much
about
those
roads,
for
example
does
it
tell
us
whether
the
state
police
are
on
those
roads
or
whether
they
have
speed
limits
or
things
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
however,
it
presents
us
with
a
hypothetical
case
quite
different
from
the
one
you
asked
us
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
does
that
tell
us
whether
the
state
spends
any
money
in
their
maintenance
and
protection
and
policing,
and
so
forth?
you
know,
the
case
would
be
different
depending
on
what
the
facts
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
the
bia
roads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
these
people
are
not
indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
what
we
are
supposed
to
decide
here,
frankly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
macpherson,
quite
apart
from
the
question
in
this
case
which
involves
indian
tribes,
what
about
a
private
owner
of
land
--
whether
it
is
the
weyerhauseur
company
or
a
rancher
who
owns
many
square
miles
of
ranch
land,
does
arizona
impose
a
tax
upon
his
fuel
if
the
vehicle
that
he
owns
is
used
exclusively
on
his
own
private
property
365
days
a
year,
or
this
year
366,
and
never
on
the
public
roads
of
arizona?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
arizona
also
allow
a
taxpayer
to
allocate
on
the
basis
of
mileage
driven
in
say
new
mexico
and
subtract
that
in
some
way
from
the
amount
of
the
tax
due
to
arizona?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
same
privilege
accorded
to
a
taxpayer
with
respect
to
mileage
driven
on
indian
reservation
roads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
has
some
importance.
i
wonder
if
my
understanding
is
coincided
with
yours
as
to
the
concession
made
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
say,
that
is
of
some
importance,
at
least
to
me,
whether
there
is
an
issue
to
taxes,
either
fuel
or
gross
receipts
taxes
imposed
on
vehicles
insofar
as
their
use
was
confined
to
tribal
roads.
is
there,
or
is
there
not
a
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
now
you
submit
there
isn't.
and
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
macpherson
cannot
concede
away
the
judgment
of
the
--
may
for
purposes
of
collecting
taxes
but
you
are
interested
in
having
the
judgment
off
the
arizona
supreme
court
modified
or
reversed.
