mr.
neil
vincent
wake
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
deals
with
the
permissibility
of
certain
state
taxation
concerning
use
of
tribal
and
bureau
of
indian
affairs
roads
on
the
reservation
when
use
is
made
by
a
non-indian
logger
as
a
part
of
a
tribal
forestry
enterprise.
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
and
its
logger
pinetop
logging
company,
actually
one
of
its
loggers,
submits
that
the
state
taxes
are
barred
by
two
separate
principles
of
federal
law.
the
first
ground
for
a
claim
of
defense
to
these
taxes
is
that
they
are
preempted
by
comprehensive
federal
regulation
of
the
fields
of
managing
and
harvesting
indian
reservation
timber.
our
second
defense
is
the
doctrine
that
state
laws
may
not
be
applied
even
to
non-indians
with
respect
to
their
dealings
with
indians
on
the
reservation
where
to
do
so
would
infringe
on
the
tribal
self-government.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
considered
either
option
available,
and
was
not
entirely
sure,
and
filed
to
serve
petition.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
my
co-counsel
mr.
michael
brown
will
address
himself
to
the
claim
of
infringement
of
tribal
self-government.
the
facts
upon
which
this
case
arised
can
be
stated
summarily
as
follows.
over
a
hundred
years
ago
president
grant
set
aside
a
reservation
for
the
white
mountain
apaches
in
a
remote
and
mountainous
part
of
arizona.
virtually
the
only
significant
resource
on
that
reservation
is
the
timber
that
grows
in
the
mountains.
fortunately
for
this
tribe,
that
resource
holds
out
the
potential
for
a
perpetually
renewable
resource
if
wisely
managed.
and,
indeed,
the
tribal
timber
enterprise
is
the
principal
financial
support
for
the
entire
tribal
government
in
all
other
tribal
programs.
in
addition,
the
tribal
timber
enterprise
is
a
major
on-reservation
employer
of
members
of
the
tribe.
obviously
an
essential
part
of
the
program
of
harvesting
this
timber
is
getting
the
trees
from
off
the
mountain
down
to
the
tribal
mill
in
white
river,
arizona.
that
process
requires
the
building
and
the
maintenance
of
an
extensive
road
system
throughout
the
reservation
and,
indeed,
there
are
literally
thousands
of
miles
of
roads
throughout
this
reservation.
most
of
these
roads,
almost
all
of
these
roads
are
built
and
maintained
by
the
tribe
itself
either
directly
or
through
its
loggers.
i
have
brought
with
me
and
intend
to
submit
to
the
clerk's
office
for
illustrative
purposes
only,
the
most
recent
u.s.
geological
survey
map
of
the
reservation
which
gives
some
indication
of
the
extent
of
the
road
system
that
is
to
be
found
thereon.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
the
loggers
have
occasion
to
cross
the
state
roads
and
to
use
them
from
time
to
time
and,
indeed,
the
pinetop
logging
company
keeps
precise
records
of
all
of
its
use
of
state
roads
and
it
pays
taxes
with
respect
to
those
uses.
this
lawsuit
does
not
involve
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
arizona
to
obtain
tax
payments
with
respect
to
the
use
of
its
own
roads
that
it
owns
or
builds
or
maintains
or
polices.
rather,
this
lawsuit
has
to
do
with
intent
by
the
state
of
arizona
to
derive
windfall
profits
for
the
benefit
of
its
state
road
system,
not
from
the
use
of
those
roads
but
from
the
use
of
wholly
different
roads
which
are
built
and
maintained
and
owned
solely
by
the
tribe
and
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
we
certainly
do
not
make
that
contention
and
the
principles
to
which
you
refer
are
general
principles
of
municipal
and
public
law
with
respect
to
taxing
authorities
of
various
taxing
entities.
what
we
are
discussing
in
this
case
is
a
different
body
of
law
which
is
a
body
of
federal
law
which
has
to
do
with
when
a
specific
congressional
regulatory
scheme
dealing
with
specific
subject
matters
preempts
interfering
state
laws.
so
the
answer
to
your
question
is
"no,"
but
i
submit
that
does
not
answer
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple.
first,
our
client
as
a
practical
matter
thought
it
fair
to
pay
those
taxes,
and
as
a
practical
matter
we
choose
not
to
bring
that
lawsuit.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
we
do
not
choose
to
challenge
the
state's
collection
of
taxes
with
respect
to
the
use
of
its
own
roads.
we
do
not
admit
liability,
we
simply
have
no
case
or
controversy
before
the
court
with
respect
to
that
question.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
the
trucks
are
licensed,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
believe
that
those
license
fees
are
paid
and
i
would
point
out
that
they
are
de
minimis
in
amount
so
far
as
my
understanding.
that
again
is
another
lawsuit
not
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
slightly
different
case.
i
submit
that
the
answer
would
probably
be
the
same.
and
let
me
elaborate
on
that
answer
for
a
moment.
again,
the
fundamental
concern
which
we
submit
the
court
must
address
itself
to
is
what
the
subject
matter
and
the
purposes
of
the
federal
regulation
is
and
whether
those
purposes
require
the
exclusion
of
these
state
taxes.
now,
in
this
case
the
federal
government
has
regulated
the
entire
field,
we
submit,
of
managing
and
harvesting
indian
timber.
these
particular
state
taxes
are
offensive
not
because
of
what
they
are
used
for
but
because
of
how
they
bear
upon
the
federal
scheme.
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
these
state
taxes
are
used
for
the
building
of
unrelated
state
roads
is
part
of
what
makes
these
taxes
worse,
it
is
not
necessarily
what
makes
them
bad.
what
makes
them
bad
is
the
fact
that
the
attempt
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
derive
tax
revenues
out
of
the
tribal
forestry
program
runs
at
cross
purposes
to
the
specifically
identified
and
articulated
federal
purposes
of
the
management
and
harvesting
of
tribal
timber.
therefore,
whether
the
state
uses
these
taxes
for
other
purposes
or
not,
is
not
necessarily
controlling.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
in
order
to
draw
the
boundaries
of
the
reach
of
the
preemptive
force
which
we
submit
must
be
recognized
here,
one
would
have
to
look
to
a
number
of
considerations.
and
there
is
no
bright
line
test
but
there
are
a
number
of
overlapping
considerations
that
are
adequate
for
purposes
of
identifying
the
specific
needs
to
protect
against
specific
state
instructions
into
the
regulatory
scheme.
i
may
list
a
few
of
them.
one
is
the
nexus
of
the
state
assertion
of
jurisdiction
with
the
direct
subject
matter
of
the
federal
regulation.
here
federal
regulation
deals
specifically
and
directly
with
the
process
of
getting
the
trees
off
the
mountain
down
to
the
mill.
that
is
the
core
of
the
entire
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme.
and
these
taxes
are
an
attempt
to
derive
revenues
off
of
that
very
subject
matter.
now
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
the
tax
is
imposed
under
state
law
on
the
conjunction
of
two
incidents.
one
is
the
burning
of
fuel
to
move
a
motor
vehicle;
and
the
other
is
the
moving
of
it
on
a
highway
or
road,
as
it
is
defined.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
our
client
pinetop
logging
company
purchases
its
diesel
fuel
in.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
--
in
interstate
commerce
and
does
not
pay
taxes
to
its
seller
in
interstate
commerce.
it
brings
the
fuel
on
the
reservation
where
it
is
stored
and
ultimately
used.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
off
of
an
indian
reservation?
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
in
that
particular
situation
i
believe
the
state
tax
would
be
properly
collectible
because
there
are
no
implications
of
federal
indian
laws
or
policies
in
that
situation.
there
would
be
no
due
process
objection
to
the
state's
right
to
tax
that.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
well
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
precisely.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
do
anticipate
the
need
for
some
rebuttal
today
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
yield
to
my
co-counsel,
mr.
brown.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
good
friend,
mr.
macpherson,
has
just
said
some
remarkable
things.
i
think
i
hear
him
saying
that
the
state
is
no
longer
interested
in
collecting
taxes
from
tribal
roads
on
the
reservation
which
are
not
bureau
of
indian
affairs
roads.
if
that
is
what
he
has
said,
then
i
am
delighted
to
accept
his
accept
his
concession.
but
i
must
also
correct
some
of
the
suggestions
he
has
made.
his
predecessor,
the
attorney
for
the
state
of
arizona,
argued
in
the
state
appellate
courts
that
the
state
was
claiming
the
right
to
tax
tribal
roads.
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
gives
the
state
the
right
to
tax
tribal
roads.
and
that
is
the
judgment
we
are
burdened
with
and
that
is
the
judgment
which
we
bring
to
this
court.
our
opening
briefs
state
that
is
the
issue.
their
briefs
acknowledge
that
is
the
issue,
and
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court.
now,
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
no,
your
honor,
what
we
have
discovered
recently
in
the
last
few
days
is
that
the
amounts
of
taxes
that
were
paid
under
protest
by
virtue
of
an
administrative
agreement
did
not
include
all
the
taxes
that
might
be
allocable
to
all
the
use
of
all
tribal
and
bia
roads.
trial
counsel,
mr.
beus
who
is
here,
informs
me
over
the
lunch
period
that
his
understanding
was
that
administrative
agreement
included
the
payment
of
certain
taxes
allocable
to
tribal
roads.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
submit
there
was
until
mr.
macpherson
spoke.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
submit
there
isn't
because
has
conceded
the
issue
or
withdrawing
the
issue.
and
perhaps
he
can
clarify
his
remarks.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
accept
it
gladly
but
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
i
would
point,
out
that
that
being
the
concession
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
be
appropriate
in
any
event
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
to
be
correct
in
that
regard
since
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
and
by
the
same
token
i
can't
accept
what
mr.
macpherson
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
complaint
for
declaratory
relief
and
refund
of
taxes.
the
issues
that
were
briefed
below
were
taxation
of
all
the
roads.
the
state
in
its
briefs
below
claimed
the
right
to
tax
all
the
roads.
they
resisted
the
refund
and
they
resisted
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
to
the
extent
that
the
judgment
on
its
terms
gives
him
the
right
to
now
disclaim
wanting
to
have.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
have
the
judgment
corrected.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
well,
there
is
--
there
still
remains
an
adversary
dispute
with
respect
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
roads,
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
--
which
i
hear
him
maintaining
his
position
with
regard
to
that.
i
hope
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
pardon?
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
those
roads,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
contrary
to
mr.
macpherson's
recollections,
are
described
in
the
record
and,
in
fact,
in
the
appendix
at
page
13
it
is
stated
in
the
affidavit
of
the
head
forester
in
charge
of
this
reservation
whose
business
it
is
to
know
about
the
roads,
that
the
state
of
arizona
contributes
absolutely
nothing
to
the
maintenance
or
repair
of
tribal
or
bia
roads.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
the
roads
are
public
in
two
senses.
they
are
public
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
regulations
require
them
to
be
open
to
the
public.
they
are
also
public
within
the
definition
of
the
arizona
tax
statutes
at
issue.
those
tax
statutes
merely
require
that
the
roads
be
in
fact
used
by
the
public.
and
that
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
tribal
roads,
as
well.
i
heard
mr.
macpherson
make
a
remark
about,
well,
perhaps
the
tribal
roads
don't
come
within
the
statutory
definition
of
where
we
can
tax.
i
will
accept
that
concession,
too.
that
wasn't
the
way
we
had
ever
read
the
statute.
his
own
in
stand
brief
filed
in
this
court
at
page
23,
footnote
35,
says
it
is
the
state's
position
of
course
that
the
roads
in
question
herein
are
public
highways
within
the
meaning
of
citing
the
statute.
now,
i
gladly
accept
his
concessions.
i
am
a
little
disturbed
at
the
implication
that
perhaps
there
is
something
here
that
we
have
proffered
to
the
court
for
decision
without
having
fully
made
the
record
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
--
on
the
issues.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
there
are
a
number
of
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
reason
is
that
you
must
go
back
to
the
regulations
which
speak
to
bureau
of
indian
affairs
roads.
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
construct
roads
on
indian
reservations
for
the
benefit
of
indians.
now,
the
regulations
require
that
they
be
open
to
the
free
use
of
the
public.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
tribal
roads
are
open
in
that
regard
also.
but
the
point
of
that
provision
of
the
secretary's
responsibilities
to
indians
is
to
benefit
indians.
it
is
not
to
excuse
state
taxation
that
otherwise
would
be
impermissible
because
of
the
requirements
of
preemptive
federal
regulatory
schemes.
now,
the
fact
is
it
is
a
public
road
in
a
factual
matter.
we
can
see
that,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
i
think
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
bia
roads
are
trust
lands.
they
are
not
publicly
owned,
they
are
trust
lands.
so
that
they
are
part
of
the
trust
administration
responsibility
of
the
secretary
and,
although
i
have
not
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
that
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
that
is
precisely
the
distinction.
the
state
of
arizona
does
nothing,
the
secretary
operates
these
roads
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
now,
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor,
i
do
not
concede
there
is
any
difference
whatsoever.
again
we
must
come
back
to
the
principal
task
at
hand
which
is
understanding
and
applying
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
in
a
way
to
promote
the
congressional
objectives
and
with
respect
to
those
federal
purposes
it
does
not
matter
whether
these
roads
are
tribal
roads
or
bia
roads.
they
are
not
state
roads.
they
are
up
there
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians,
the
state
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
them.
it
doesn't
police
them,
it
doesn't
regulate
them,
it
won't
write
an
accident
report
on
them
if
you
have
an
accident
there.
now,
again,
--
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
your
honor
this
comes
back
to
one
of
the
first
questions
asked
this
morning.
mr.
neil
vincent
wake
it
might,
your
honor.
i
can
see
equities
in
the
other
side.
our
client
chose
not
to
finance
that
lawsuit,
is
the
truth
of
it.
and
their
intention
is
to
continue
to
pay
taxes
allocable
to
the
use
of
state
roads.
and
i
might
add
that
was
done
before
getting
the
benefit
of
counsel.
they
thought
that
was
fair
and
that
is
the
way
they
want
to
do
things.
and,
in
any
event,
the
funds
allocable
to
the
state
road
i
don't
think
are
significant
enough
for
us
to
trouble
at
this
point.
thank
you.
