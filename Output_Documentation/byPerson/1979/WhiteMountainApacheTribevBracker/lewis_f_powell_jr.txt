justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wake,
can
i
ask
you
another
question.
with
respect
to
the
8-cent-per-gallon
fuel
tax,
the
statute
says
"for
the
purpose
of
partially
compensating
the
state
for
the
use
of
its
highways,"
and
so
forth,
the
8-cent
tax
is
imposed.
supposing
the
statute
said
in
order
to
generate
general
revenues
for
the
state,
the
tax
in
this
amount
is
imposed
and
went
into
the
general
funds.
would
your
case
be
the
same?
