mr.
michael
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
taxation
which
the
state
seeks
to
reimpose
in
this
case
is
an
infringement
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
and
its
right
of
tribal
self-government.
it
interferes
with
a
fundamental
purpose,
as
well
as
the
basic
nature
of
the
reservation.
one
of
the
most
basic
principles
of
indian
law
is
that
those
powers
vested
in
an
indian
tribe
are
not
delegated
but
are
rather
inherent
powers
of
limited
sovereignty.
they
are
inherent
in
that
that
sovereignty
preexisted
both
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
arizona
as
well
as
united
states
of
america
itself.
williams
v.
lee
has
said
that
the
test
of
sovereignty
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
affairs
of
non-indians
on
reservations
is
that
the
tribe
and
the
state
law,
that
each
have
legitimate
interests
but
that
the
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
laws
and
be
ruled
by
them
shall
remain
inviolate.
congress
has
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
sir,
congress
has
the
power
of
defeasance
to
take
away
the
sovereignty
which
the
indian
tribes
retain,
but
it
has
not
yet
done
so.
and
the
indications
from
congress
of
course
are
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
congress
has
given,
for
example,
in
1953
five
states
the
right
to
extend
both
their
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
to
indian
reservations,
and
to
allow
those
states
to
accept
the
benefits
of
that
as
well
as
the
responsibilities
for
the
tribes
in
public
law
280.
arizona,
while
not
one
of
the
five
delegated
states,
had
the
right
and
the
power
by
several
means
to
ascribe
to
public
law
280
and
accept
the
responsibilities
for
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
and
the
other
tribes
with
reservations
within
the
state
of
arizona
and
refused
to
do
so.
this
lawsuit
is
essentially
about
roads
and
trees.
the
state
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
about
taxes.
but
it
is
about
the
fact
that
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe's
reservation,
which
is
the
fort
apache
reservation,
--
it
is
in
northeastern
arizona
and
it
is
1,600,000
acres,
it
is
rural
and
it
is
mountainous
and
it
is
widespread
and
with
people
all
over
that
reservation.
it
is
not
an
urban
area
and
the
major
rural
or
urban
area
is
white
river
and
it
has
maybe
1,000
to
1,500
people
living
in
it.
one
of
the
designed
secondary
purposes
of
the
tribal
timber
industry
is
the
creation
of
roads.
the
timber
industry
must
in
fact
create
roads
to
get
to
the
trees
so
that
they
can
be
logged,
the
forests
can
be
logged.
but
also
it
is
necessary
to
create
adequate
roads
into
those
rural
and
remote
areas
so
that
we
can
have
the
ability
to
deliver
food
and
essential
services
to
remote
areas
of
the
reservation
and
to
maintain
communications
with
those
areas.
and
that
is
a
direct
and
design
product
of
the
roadbuilding
and
the
maintenance
program
of
the
tribe
and
the
fort
apache
timber
company
and
the
loggers
who
are
agents
to
create
a
good
number
of
the
roads
and
by
contract
of
course
maintain
the
roads
pursuant
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
criteria
and
regulations
of
the
federal
government.
in
moe
this
court
said
that
states
in
dealing
with
actions
on
reservations
involving
indians
and
non-indians
that
the
state
would
be
allowed
to
tax
those
kinds
of
transactions.
if
there
was
a
significant
interest
that
the
state
had
in
some
real
economic
benefit
was
going
not
to
the
indian
party
involved
in
the
transaction
but
to
a
non-indian.
and
that
essentially
what
was
happening
was
that
this
transaction,
or
attempt
to
cloak
this
transaction
in
immunity
was
merely
an
end
run
by
the
non-indian
around
legitimate
taxing
interests
of
the
state.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
valid
test
and
that
there
ought
to
be
some
way
that
this
court
can
draw
a
line
quite
apart
from
the
preemption
argument
made
in
warren
trading
post
along
the
infringement
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
the
infringement
of
tribal
self-government.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
an
easement
from
the
federal
government
and
the
tribe.
we
believe
that
the
tax
infringement
test
ought
to
consider
at
least
four
things.
number
one,
the
location.
obviously
the
indian
reservation
itself
is
historically
the
locus
where
federal
indian
policy
is
effectuated.
historically
all
of
this,
and
actually
in
this
litigation
all
of
the
activities
involved
take
place
within
the
confines
of
the
fort
apache
reservation
on
the
white
mountain
apache's
land
held
in
trust
for
them
by
the
federal
government.
another
issue
is
does
it
interfere
with
the
fundamental
purpose
or
nature
of
the
reservation.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
with
the
geographical
make-up
of
the
reservation
that
congress
and
the
president
in
making
up
the
reservation
could
not
have
anticipated
that
a
tribal
timber
industry
was
going
to
be
necessary.
number
three,
where
does
the
burden
truly
fall,
on
the
indian
or
the
non-indian.
clearly
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you
call
a
tax.
you
can
call
it
a
sales
tax,
a
privilege
tax,
an
excise
tax,
a
motor
carrier
tax.
the
question
is
where
does
the
burden
fall.
that
is
just
what
the
state
wants
to
do
with
the
taxing
scheme.
in
this
case
it
is
admitted
that
the
economic
--
the
total
economic
burden
and
direct
economic
burden
falls
on
the
tribe
and
the
tribal
timber
industry
in
that
dollar
for
dollar
the
tribe
must
pay
to
planter
all
the
money
the
money
they
expend
for
the
tax.
in
this
case,
another
issue
and
thing
that
i
think
that
the
court
ought
to
look
at
in
formulating
a
test
is
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
state
in
the
tribe.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
sir.
i
know
that
clearly
that
is
not
a
case
of
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
i
think
that
is
not
a
direct
burden.
i
think
that
is
an
indirect
burden
because
whether
they
pay
the
tax
on
the
purchase
of
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
well,
that
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
not
necessarily.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
i
mean
it
is
speculative
that
they
will
pick
up
the
tab.
the
purchase
of
the
trucks
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
going
to
cost
us,
that
the
tribe
less
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
well,
the
fact
that
they
may
amortize
the
price
of
the
trucks
as
an
indirect
cost,
if
at
all,
and
the
fact
that
they
must
pay
a
tax
on
the
use
of
tribal
roads
is
a
direct
cost.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
sir,
i
do.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
the
court
is
interested
in
and
i
think
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
it
is
a
tax
that
is
measured
by
use
of
our
roads.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
therefore
you
have
to
have
two
things
come
together.
you
have
to
have
the
use
of
the
roads
as
to
a
vehicle
and
the
use
of
the
roads.
the
roads
are
--
you
can't
separate
them
from
the
tax.
if
you
don't
have
the
roads,
they
don't
have
a
tax.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
it
is
8
cents
a
gallon.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
that
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
right.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
it
is
2-1/2
percent
of
the
gross
proceeds
measured
by
the
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
no.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes,
it
is
2-1/2
--
mr.
michael
j.
brown
that
is
right.
we
have
to
give
them
2-1/2
logs
out
of
every
hundred
that
we
cut.
that
is
what
that
tax
is.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
if
they
don't
haul
the
logs,
they
don't
get
the
tax.
mr.
michael
j.
brown
i
understand.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
that
the
court
wants
to
look
at
is
the
potential
for
abuse
of
the
tax.
and
because
this
tax
and
the
transaction
that
you
are
dealing
with
is
wholly
on
the
reservation
that
there
is
no
potential
for
abuse.
we
are
not
dealing
with
montana
chain
smokers
or
any
of
that
sort
of
thing.
this
tax
is
wholly
on
the
reservation
and
it
is
directly
on
a
tribal
enterprise.
