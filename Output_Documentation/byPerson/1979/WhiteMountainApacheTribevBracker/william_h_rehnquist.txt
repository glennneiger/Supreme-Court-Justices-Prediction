justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
saying
it
is
entirely
immaterial,
but
it
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
as
a
matter
of
general
tax
apportionment
law
that
a
state
could
not
exact
a
license
fee
for
the
use
of
a
vehicle
and
devote
the
proceeds
of
that
tax
to
maintenance
of
roads
and
base
it
on
the
value
of
the
vehicle;
and
that
the
owner
of
a
vehicle
could
nonetheless
say,
well,
i
only
drive
my
car
to
church
on
sunday,
so
although
your
tax
would
come
out
to
be
computed
$100
i
am
paying
you
$3,
which
i
think
is
the
value
that
i
use
your
road.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
does
pinetop
keep
specific
records
of
its
use
on
arizona
state
highways?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
in
effect,
you
say
that
you
might
be
able
to
challenge
those
laws
but
you
are
electing
to
pay
a
part
of
the
tax
that
is
levied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
violated
--
if
it
so
chooses,
can
it
not
under
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brown,
i
notice
from
the
outlet
that
state
highway
73
itself
goes
through
white
river.
what
is
the
source
of
the
state's
authority
to
build
a
highway
on
an
indian
reservation?
was
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
tax
on
the
purchase
of
the
trucks.
suppose
that
pinetop
buys
some
trucks
off
the
reservation
and
a
tax
is
added
to
the
purchase
price
and
pinetop
says,
we
are
only
going
to
use
these
on
the
reservation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
wholly
consistent
with
moe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
they
come
onto
the
reservation,
collect
money,
make
the
indians
collect
it,
and
return
it
to
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
geographical
matter
is
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
of
talismatic
significance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
haven't
made
a
commerce
argument
yet;
i
guess
you
aren't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
not
understood
pinetop's
argument
to
be
a
question
of
discrimination.
i
have
understood
it
to
be
an
argument
of
preemption
and
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
a
narrower
ground
might
exist
here
where
the
arizona
tax
is
faulty
in
that
if
it
allows
such
a
deduction
for
travel
in
new
mexico
but
not
on
the
white
river
reservation
roads
is
it
entitled
to
make
that
sort
of
discrimination
under
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was
phrased
i
believe,
is
arizona
allowed
to
make
this
distinction?
you
answered
"it
is
not."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
follow
up
indicates
to
me
that
you
meant
it
is
allowed
to
make
that
assumption.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
he
required
to
vest
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
he
was
required
to
collect
it
from
the
vendee.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
your
preemptive
argument
then
cover
state
roads,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
might,
but
you
don't
want
us
to
consider
it
and
you
don't
assert
it?
