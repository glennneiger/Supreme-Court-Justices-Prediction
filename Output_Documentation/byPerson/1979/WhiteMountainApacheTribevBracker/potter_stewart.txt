how
is
that
different
from
charging
a
tax
say
--
sales
taxes
or
something
like
that
on
the
purchase
of
the
vehicles
which
are
used
exclusively
in
the
logging
business?
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
the
taxes
imposed
on
the
gas
is
pumped
into
the
tank,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
the
tax
just
added
to
the
price
per
gallon
of
gasoline?
justice
potter
stewart
diesel
fuel.
justice
potter
stewart
would
this
tax
be
imposed
--
and
maybe
i
am
echoing
my
brother
stevens'
question
--
on
the
operator
of
a
timber
company,
say
weyerhauesur
company
or
something
that
used
its
fuel
and
used
its
vehicles
exclusively
on
its
own
private
property?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
never
on
state
or
tax-supported
roads.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
think
that
there
might
well
be.
you
don't
represent
that
client,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wake,
just
to
go
back
for
a
second,
and
i
think
it
is
the
same
point
justice
stewart
asked
you,
you
point
out
that
here
the
fuel
is
bought
in
large
quantities
and
actually
pumped
on
the
reservation.
i
take
it
your
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
it
were
bought
at
retail
from
local
gas
stations
off
the
reservations.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
clearly
a
case
there
that
the
burden
--
where
the
burden,
the
ultimate
burden
would
fall
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be
a
little
larger
shell
in
the
sense
that
that
--
in
the
sense
that
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
indians
are
going
to
pick
up
the
tab,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
pinetop
doesn't
do
any
business
except
on
the
reservation,
i
am
told,
i
read
in
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
sooner
or
later
they
are
going
to
have
to
got
their
money
back
from
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
make
the
same
argument
about
repairs
to
the
trucks?
justice
potter
stewart
tune-ups
at
the
garage?
justice
potter
stewart
call
it
a
tax
on
the
use
of
the
roads
or
is
it
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
of
their
entire
business?
justice
potter
stewart
miles
traveled,
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
not
talking
about
the
motor
fuel
tax,
we
are
talking
about
the
other
one
now.
what
is
the
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
8
cents
a
gallon
wherever
the
gas
was
burned.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
now
what
about
the
other
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
not
per
mile.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
depend
on
how
much
logs
they
carried
and
how
much
money
they
made,
and
so
forth.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
really
not
a
tax
on
the
use
of
the
road.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
no
matter
how
far
they
have
to
haul
the
logs?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
not
really
a
tax
on
the
use
of
the
roads
or
tax
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
well,
i
understand
that
but
it
is
the
same
i
am
buying
a
truck
and
all
the
other
elements
of
doing
business.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
just
one
preliminary
question
and
then
i
won't
interrupt
any
more.
assume
that
the
logging
companies
did
half
their
business
on
the
reservation.
would
they
be
entitled
to
a
50
percent
exemption
from
both
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
how
much
of
their
business
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
saying
this
is
true
of
commerce,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
same
is
true
on
the
indian
commerce
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
just
as
such,
unimplemented
by
any
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
go
ahead
then
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
they
are
independent.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
clear
enough.
but
you
say
they
are
interrelated.
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
are
rather
inconsistent
with
each
other.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
that
is
very
superficial
but
superficially
it
sounds
they
seem
inconsistent.
if
we
are
talking
about
tribal
independence,
that
means
independence
from
anything
and
everything.
justice
potter
stewart
including
federal
control.
justice
potter
stewart
quasi-independence.
justice
potter
stewart
independence
from
state
but
not
from
federal
controls,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
tribal
scheme
totally
self-sufficient
so
the
tribes
operated
the
logging
enterprise
themselves,
then
they
would
be
tax
exempt.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
sustain
the
state
here,
they
have
a
competitive
advantage
in
doing
it
themselves.
it
would
be
an
additional
incentive,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
save
the
taxes.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
extent
that
that
is
either
a
burden
or
a
benefit.
