mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
think
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
address
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
during
mr.
wake's
opening
remarks,
mr.
brown's
opening
remarks
and
the
united
states'
remarks.
specifically,
it
is
my
recollection
that
justice
stevens
was
inquiring
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
were
talking
about
the
same
principles,
were
we
talking
about
a
general
gross
receipts
tax.
what
about
weyerhauesur
or
some
other
company
operating
on
the
reservation,
would
they
be
subject
to
a
gross
receipts
tax
if
in
fact
we
weren't
talking
about
either
the
use
fuel
tax
or
the
motor
carrier
tax.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
"yes."
in
footnote
13
of
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
we
find
a
discussion
of
arizona
revised
statutes
section
42-1309
and
1312.
now,
those
were
the
statutes
that
were
under
consideration
by
this
court
in
warren
trading
post.
an
examination
of
the
transaction
privilege
tax
code
will
reveal
in
ars
section
42-1321
an
exemption
for
the
transportation
of
tangible
personal
property
from
point
a
to
point
b
within
the
state
of
arizona
if
the
outfit
being
purportedly
otherwise
subject
to
the
transaction
privilege
tax
pays
a
tax
under
40-641.
the
point
is
under
40-641
they
are
subjected
to
the
motor
carrier
tax
which
has
a
relationship
to
state
roads
at
a
rate
of
2-1/2
percent.
under
section
42-1310,
which
is
under
the
transaction
privilege
tax
code,
they
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
the
transaction
privilege
tax
with
respect
to
hauling
within
the
state
of
arizona.
they
are
exempted
by
virtue
of
state
law
under
section
42-1321.
so
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
is
yes,
a
transaction
privilege
tax
would
apply
to
that
transportation.
again,
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here
this
morning
but
if
that
case
were
to
come
up,
then
the
question
becomes
would
it
be
permissible
as
a
matter
of
indian
law.
again,
it
would
remain
the
state
of
arizona's
position,
yes,
we
are
dealing
with
a
non-indian
entity
on
an
indian
reservation.
any
economic
burden
of
either
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax,
the
motor
carrier
tax
or
the
use
fuel
tax
which
may
be
visited
upon
the
indian
reservation
arises
solely
by
virtue
of
contractual
negotiation,
nothing
else.
there
is
absolutely
no
requirement
of
the
state
law
under
any
of
those
three
taxes
that
these
costs
be
passed
on
or
that
the
legal
incidents
be
shifted
over.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
we
would
not
tax
them?
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
on
the
theory
--
well,
does
your
hypo
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
does
your
hypothetical
perceive
those
roads
to
be
private
roads?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
no,
sir,
we
would
not.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
at
this
point,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate,
and
i
have
discussed
this
with
the
court's
leave,
with
mr.
wake,
by
way
of
explanation
as
to
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
there
apparently
was
some
misunderstanding
with
respect
to
exactly
what
issues
were
before
the
arizona
courts
with
respect
to
what
roads
and
what
taxes
we
were
being
--
we
were
taxing
the
use
with
respect
thereto.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
very
good,
your
honor.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
pinetop
operation
occurs
totally
within
the
confines
of
the
fort
apache
indian
reservation.
there
are
several
types
of
roads
on
that
reservation,
including
state
highways.
and
this
gets
to
the
question
that
one
of
your
other
honors
asked
what
about
this
fact
that
they
use
state
highways?
with
respect
to
the
travel
on
those
state
highways,
they
have
paid
the
taxes
without
protest.
it
is
my
recollection
mr.
wake
indicated
that
they
choose
not
to
challenge
that.
certain
other
travel
occurring
on
bia-designated
roads,
tribal
roads
and
other
types
of
roads
on
the
reservation
are
the
subject
of
the
lawsuit
here.
with
respect
to
travel
on
the
bia
roads,
it
is
the
state
of
arizona's
position
that
the
assessment
in
question
relates
to
those
--
the
use
of
those
highways
and
pursuant
to
federal
law,
even
without
regard
to
the
hayden-cartwright
act,
travel
on
those
roads
is
specifically
authorized
by
virtue
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
farmer
brown's
roads
are
private
roads.
by
virtue
of
federal
regulations
bia
roads
are
"open
to
free
public
use,"
by
mandate
of
the
regulation.
and
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
marshall,
trouble
--
he
would
perhaps
travel
on
those
roads
would
be
subjected
to
the
tax.
but
so
long
as
the
road
remained
a
private
thoroughfare
they
would
not
be
so
traveled
and
use
of
those
road
would
not
be
subject
to
the
state
tax.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
this
entire
area
has
been
preempted,
it
is
the
state
of
arizona's
position
that
quite
the
contrary,
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
speaks
in
terms
of
sound
management
of
the
forest
resource.
the
federal
objective
is
to
protect
the
forest
resource,
to
protect
it
from
disease,
fire,
various
other
plagues
and
famines
that
might
occur
that
would
destroy
or
harm
the
forest
resource.
the
state
of
arizona
respectfully
submits
that
that
preempts
area
a,
and
we
are
talking
about
area
b.
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
federal
statutes
or
the
code
of
federal
regulations
upon
which
pinetop
and
the
tribe
rely
to
indicate
a
congressional
intent
or,
indeed,
an
intent
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
preempt
costs.
indeed,
the
code
of
federal
regulations
specifically
provides
with
respect
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
that
administrative
costs
up
to
the
extent
of
some
10
percent
of
the
gross
receipts
of
the
tribal
enterprise
might
be
subjected
to
a
charge
to
cover
these
administrative
expenses.
so
the
congressional
objective,
while
it
may
be
to
protect
the
forest
resource,
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
as
was
present
in
warren
trading
post
with
respect
to
the
prices
that
a
trader
could
charge.
there
is
nothing
in
these
regulations
to
suggest
that
the
cost
that
pinetop
incurs
in
pursuing
its
activities
on
the
reservation
are
similarly
preempted.
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things.
mr.
brown
mentioned
that
public
law
280
was
passed
for
purposes
of
permitting
states
to
assume
criminal
jurisdiction
and
civil
jurisdiction
over
civil
positive
action.
well,
in
fact
this
court's
decision
in
bryan
v.
itasca
county
establishes
that
that
grant
of
authority
by
congress
does
not
extend
to
states
if
they
desire
to
impose
the
direct
legal
obligation
of
state
taxes
upon
reservation
indians.
quite
the
contrary,
public
law
280
was
construed
by
this
court
to
extend
to
civil
causes
of
action,
tort
cases,
contract
cases,
access
to
the
state
courts.
so
if
the
suggestion
be
that
had
arizona
adopted
public
law
280
this
would
be
a
different
case,
arizona
would
submit
it
is
just
not
so.
this
court
would
have
to
ignore
bryan
v.
itasca
county.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
stevens,
yes,
there
are.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes.
that
puts
the
issue
right
before
us
and
i
--
this
relates
again
to
the
discussions
that
mr.
wake
and
i
have
had
since
arriving
in
washington.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
is
before
this
court,
does
not
differentiate
between
bia
roads
and
tribal
roads.
the
fact
is
however
that
the
assessment
that
was
made
by
the
arizona
taxing
authorities
related
only
to
the
taxes
attributable
to
pinetop's
operation
upon
bia
roads.
use
on
tribal
roads
was
extracted,
that
was
not
subjected
to
taxation.
now,
it
is
true,
i
must
confess,
that
that
position
was
not
specifically
or
clearly
advocated
in
the
appellate
briefs,
nor
does
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
make
that
distinction.
however,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
under
current
state
law,
under
the
legislative
scheme
that
exists
in
arizona
right
now,
arizona
has
no
intention
of
going
forward
on
some
purported
theory
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
decision
says
we
can,
that
we
can
go
ahead
and
tax
use
on
these
tribal
roads.
i
have
been
assured
of
that
by
my
client
by
telephone
last
night.
and
other
than
that
we
would
put
that
before
the
court
to
apprise
the
court
of
what
the
true
facts
are.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
however
that
that
goes
to
the
question
of
magnitude
of
what
the
burden
is.
by
that
i
mean
mr.
wake's
argument
presumably
will
be
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
--
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
if
we
were
talking
about
use
on
tribal
roads
too
there
would
be
a
lot
more
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
bia
roads.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
no,
if
i
may
correct
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
states
that
with
respect
to
all
the
roads,
private
roads,
bia
roads,
all
of
the
roads,
go
ahead
and
impose
these
taxes.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
i
don't
defend
that
position.
i
defend
it
to
the
extent
that
the
term
"tribal
roads"
includes
bia
roads.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
because
there
was
no
differentiation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
specifically
go
into
that
much
detail.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
case
is
--
we
felt
it
necessary
as
an
ethical
consideration
to
apprise
the
court
of
what
the
actual
situation
is.
but,
having
said
that,
the
issue,
the
legal
issue,
if
it
please
the
court,
may
still
be
decided
with
respect
to
the
bia
road
use.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
bia
roads
pursuant
to
federal
--
the
code
of
federal
regulations
are
required
to
be
open
to
free
public
use,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
the
record
does
not
specifically
present
us
with
those
facts.
however,
there
are
facts
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
posting
of
speed
limits,
for
example,
are
done
by
other
than
--
at
least
with
respect
to
the
tribal
roads
are
done
by
jurisdictions
other
than
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
my
recollection,
your
honor,
is
that
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
we
may
establish
speed
limits
on
bia
roads.
perhaps
mr.
wake
can
fill
me
in
on
that.
the
only
roads
that
we
exercise
jurisdiction
over
--
and,
again,
only
with
respect
to
non-indians
--
the
law
in
arizona
is
that
even
if
we
have
a
state
highway
through
a
reservation
we
cannot
assert
direct
jurisdiction
over
indians
on
those
roads.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
arizona's
position
is
this.
the
legal
question
as
to
whether
or
not
these
state
taxes
may
be
applied
under
notions
of
this
exists
in
an
area
other
than
a
preempted
area
or
under
notions
of
the
application
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act
can
be
decided
on
the
bia
road
issue
alone.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
we
talk
about
the
tribal
roads,
as
i
was
attempting
to
explain,
mr.
wake's
argument
probably
will
be
--
and,
again,
i
don't
mean
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
--
but
if
we
are
talking
about
the
authority
of
the
state
to
impose
these
taxes
on
tribal
roads
as
well,
then
the
amount,
the
economic
burden
of
these
taxes
is
going
to
be
much
greater.
and
therefore
mr.
macpherson's
argument
that
the
magnitude
of
these
taxes
is
of
some
relevance
goes
out
the
window
because
the
footnote
that
we
have
in
our
brief
based
upon
the
record
attempts
to
establish
a
percentage
of
what
the
true
economic
burden
is
with
respect
to
a
particular
time
period.
that
percentage
would
change
by
going
up
if
the
state
were
taxing
tribal
roads
as
well.
but
that
is
a
consideration
apart
from
the
question
of
bia
road
use
and
whether
or
not
the
hayden-cartwright
act
applies.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
presumably
it
could,
but
it
has
not.
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
tribal
roads
were
taken
out
of
the
exemption.
they
were
not
--
or,
excuse
me,
taken
out
of
the
assessment.
but
they
were
not
taken
out
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
indian
roads.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
they
were
taken
out
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
private
roads.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
and
that
is
the
current
state
of
the
law.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
yes,
it
does.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
it
is
not;
and
that
is
the
question
that
we
have
here.
at
least
the
argument
is
being
advanced
--
my
understanding
of
the
argument
being
advanced
by
pinetop
is
that
that
is
the
vice
in
the
arizona
statute.
it
does
not
allocate
between
use
of
state
roads
within
the
reservation
and
roads
other
than
state
roads
on
the
reservation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not,
for
this
reason.
in
the
first
instance,
the
tribal
outside
the
state
of
arizona
occurs
in
a
jurisdiction
beyond
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
arizona.
now,
having
said
that,
the
question
becomes.
is
the
fort
apache
indian
reservation
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
reach,
if
you
will,
of
arizona?
arizona
would
submit
that,
no,
it
is
not.
number
one,
this
is
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
surplus
trading
v.
cook.
it
would
also
presuppose
the
existence
of
a
state
within
a
state
or
a
nation
within
a
state.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
excuse
me.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is
allowed
to
make
that
distinction.
it
has
not
made
that
distinction.
that
would
present
a
different
case
and
i
am
sure
that
--
you
know,
that
there
would
be
--
well,
i
am
not
sure
but
there
would
likely
be
litigation
on
that
point
as
well.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
however
we
haven't
really
discussed
this
court's
decision
in
oliphant
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
for
example,
a
non-indian
robs
a
bank
--
that
is
a
bad
example,
that
is
federal
--
robs
a
convenience
market
in
white
river
and
goes
running
off
to
a
tribal
road.
question
can
the
state
dps
officers
chase
him?
that
is
a
separate
question.
but
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
the
state
does
not
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
tribal
roads.
however,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
have
attempted
in
footnote
35
of
our
brief
to
explain
that
that
is
a
state
law
question
that
has
been
specifically
decided
against
the
position
advanced
by
pinetop
logging.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
thomas
v.
gay
and
kelly
v.
pittsburgh,
which
is
cited
in
thomas
v.
gay,
there
is
no
ironclad
requirement
of
benefits
burdens
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
tax
is
applicable
or
not.
surely
it
is
one
of
the
considerations
and
it
is
one
of
the
considerations
that
pinetop
is
making
--
they
are
basing
their
argument
upon.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
a
matter
of
state
law
it
is
arizona's
position
that
that
question
has
been
resolved
against
them.
the
thrust
of
their
position
is
based
upon
notions
of
preemption
in
indian
sovereignty.
and
with
respect
to
the
discussion
of
both,
or
all
three
of
the
counsel
this
question
of
self-government
which
continues
to
be
discussed,
arizona
would
submit
should
not
be
considered
in
a
vacuum.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
attribute
sovereignty
is
the
negotiation
of
contracts.
there
is
no
requirement
of
state
law
that
these
taxes
be
borne
by
them.
if
they
want
them
away,
that
is
fine.
with
respect
to
a
final
question
asked
by
justice
stevens
in
the
opening
remarks,
the
competitive
advantage
of
the
tribe
that
would
be
enjoyed
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
reversed,
merits
a
little
closer
examination.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutes
or
the
code
of
federal
regulations
that
arizona
can
see,
at
least,
that
suggests
that
as
a
matter
of
economic
principle
and
in
connection
with
the
federal
objective
of
providing
or
permitting
the
generation
by
the
forest
resource
of
the
--
whatever
profit
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
thank
you.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
when
we
broke
for
lunch
i
was
attempting
to
respond
to
one
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
stevens
had
asked
of
counsel
for
the
amicus
curiae
united
states
with
respect
to
the
competitive
advantage
enjoyed
by
the
tribe
with
respect
to
a
situation
if
these
taxes
were
voided.
the
state
of
arizona
finds
nothing
in
the
federal
scheme,
either
the
code
of
federal
regulations
or
the
federal
statutes,
which
would
suggest
a
prohibition
upon
the
tribe
as
any
other
business
and
profit-motivated
entity
from
itself
seeking
to
recover
these
costs
when
it
engages
in
the
business
of
marketing
the
timber
product.
we
concede
that
that
is
not
sufficient
grounds
in
and
of
itself
to
substantiate
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
upon
the
non-indian
in
the
first
place.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
not.
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
they
simply
haven't
done
that.
what
congress
has
done
through
the
enactment
of
the
federal
statutes
and
what
has
been
authorized
insofar
as
federal
regulations
is
concerned
simply
does
not
concern
that
area.
it
concerns
the
preservation
and
maintenance
of
the
forest
resource.
and
contrary,
at
least
in
arizona's
position,
to
the
argument
advanced
by
pinetop,
there
is
no
articulable
objective
in
the
federal
scheme
mandating
that
the
entire
economic
benefit
of
the
tribal
resource
come
to
the
tribe.
rather,
the
language
used
is
whatever
economic
benefit
it
may
generate.
it
is
one
thing
to
state
that
the
entire
economic
benefit
should
come
to
the
tribe,
thereby
suggesting
that
any
and
all
cost
which
somehow
burden
the
accomplishment
of
that
objective
are
prohibited.
in
fact
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
contemplates
just
the
opposite
with
respect
to
the
administrative
charge
provision
when
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
involved.
so
the
state
of
arizona's
position
on
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
is
that,
yes,
there
may
be
a
competitive
advantage
if
these
taxes
are
voided.
however,
congress
--
neither
congress
nor
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
in
our
estimation,
has
acted
to
insulate
the
indians
from
those
cost
burdens;
and,
in
fact,
in
pursuance
of
the
federal
objective
it
would
seem
that
they
could
recover
these
costs
just
as
they
recover
the
costs
of
the
actual
board
feet
charge
that
is
contemplated
under
the
contract
with
pinetop.
it
is
sound
business
practice.
there
is
nothing
in
the
contract.
indeed,
it
is
a
good
objective.
and
they
may
follow
that.
with
respect
to
the
hayden-cartwright
act,
although
it
is
stated
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
that
the
state's
principal
defense
of
its
use
fuel
tax
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act,
i
feel
it
incumbent
that
the
court
be
aware
that
the
hayden-cartwright
act
at
least
in
so
many
words,
that
it
was
first
raised
by
the
petitioners
in
an
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
it
did
not
apply
by
the
petitioners
in
an
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
it
did
not
apply.
but
upon
further
examination,
the
hayden-cartwright
act
in
the
state
of
arizona's
estimation
does
indeed,
even
if
all
these
other
arguments
be
rejected,
does
constitute
the
type
of
specific
federal
regulation
contemplated
under
williams
v.
lee.
the
rule
in
williams
v.
lee
of
course
is
that
absent
congressional
enactments
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
the
state
law
infringes
upon
the
right
of
self-government.
if
all
of
arizona's
previous
arguments
be
rejected,
the
fact
remains
that
the
hayden-cartwright
act
appears
to
be
precisely
that
kind
of
legislation
contemplated
by
congress.
we
have
cited
and
direct
the
court's
attention
to
another
solicitor's
opinion,
57
id-129.
in
that
particular
opinion
solicitor
margold
as
i
recall
discusses
the
application
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act
to
the
operations
of
the
menominee
mills,
and
in
that
opinion
he
specifically
states
that
while
sales
of
motor
vehicle
fuels
for
use
in
the
direct
operations
of
the
menominee
tribal
saw
mill
would
be
exempt
from
the
state
motor
vehicle
fuel
taxes
in
wisconsin.
the
fact
is
that
he
decided
that,
or
he
opined
that
in
the
context
of
a
federal
instrumentality.
in
the
present
case
we
don't
have
a
federal
instrumentality.
we
have
a
non-indian
independent
contractor,
and
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
the
terminology
--
i
think
the
record
speaks
for
itself
in
the
verified
complaint
--
establishes
that
pinetop
logging
is
an
independent
contractor
who
is
a
non-indian
who
bears
the
legal
incidents
of
these
taxes.
as
a
matter
of
contract
doctrine,
he
passes
them
on.
the
opinion
goes
on,
however,
to
specifically
opine
that
the
hayden-cartwright
act
was
intended
by
congress
to
apply
to
indian
reservations.
the
solicitor
goes
through
several
discussions
and
tracings
of
evidences
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
hayden-
cartwright
act
which
established
in
his
mind
an
attempt
on
behalf
of
congress
to
permit
the
application
of
these
taxes
on
indian
reservations
including,
in
arizona's
estimation
as
we
read
the
opinion,
the
direct
application
of
these
state
motor
vehicle
fuel
taxes
to
indians
on
the
indian
reservation,
provided
only
that
they
be
not
imposed
upon
the
operations
of
the
menominee
sawmill
itself.
indeed,
employees
of
the
mill,
indian
employees
of
the
mill,
at
page
140
of
the
opinion,
are
specifically
opined
to
be
subject
to
the
tax.
in
point
of
fact,
the
solicitor
refers
to
his
memorandum
for
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
of
february
4,
1938.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
the
tracing
of
the
history
of
both
the
hayden-cartwright
act
and
the
buck
act,
that
particular
memorandum
of
february
4,
1938,
which
is
now
available,
in
the
opinions
of
the
solicitor,
establishes
some
very
interesting
points,
primary
amongst
them
being
the
fact
that
where
the
tax
under
consideration
is
a
true
sales
tax,
that
is
a
vendee
responsibility
tax,
then,
and
for
that
reason,
must
the
state
tax
be
voided
with
respect
to
its
application
to
indians
on
indian
reservations.
an
examination
of
the
opinion,
however,
will
also
reveal
that
it
discusses
it
in
the
context
of
the
utah
sales
tax.
at
that
point
in
time
utah
had
a
true
sales
tax.
the
taxable
event
was
the
transfer
of
tangible
personal
property,
the
liability
for
the
tax
by
mandate
of
state
law,
was
upon
the
vendee.
it
is
not
surprising,
therefore,
that
in
that
opinion
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
to
impose
these
taxes
upon
an
indian
tribe
on
the
uintah
reservation
in
utah
would
be
impermissible,
whether
the
taxes
be
imposed
on
transactions
by
the
indians
or
purchases
from
the
indians.
in
that
regard,
the
opinion
in
the
moe
case
seems
to
have
eroded
somewhat
even
that
determination.
this
court
should
be
aware
--
and
i
am
sure
it
is
--
that
in
the
moe
case
all
we
were
talking
about
is
putting
the
shoe
on
the
other
foot,
as
it
were.
the
economic
burden
of
the
state
tax,
at
least
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
was
placed
not
by
contract
but
by
mandate
of
state
law
directly
upon
an
indian.
joe
wheeler
was
an
indian.
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
licensed
indian
trader
but
clearly
he
appears
to
have
been
engaged
in
that
kind
of
activity
on
the
reservation
that
fits
the
definition
of
indian
trader.
we
don't
know
if
he
is
an
indian
of
the
whole
blood
and
therefore
exempt.
nevertheless,
he
was
an
indian
on
the
indian
reservation,
he
was
subjected
by
mandate
of
state
law
to
the
pre-collection
of
the
montana
taxes.
this
court
upheld
it
in
a
unanimous
opinion.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
mr.
wheeler
charged
or
added
the
price
of
the
tax
on
to
the
non-indians,
in
effect
what
he
was
doing
was
reimbursing
himself.
the
tax
had
already
been
paid.
it
had
been
pre-collected
for
purposes
of
convenience
only.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
he
wasn't
required
to
pass
it
on.
the
initial
incidence
of
the
tax
was
upon
the
non-indian,
on
the
vendee.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
he
was
required
pre-collect
it.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
excuse
me,
and
you
are
quite
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
the
rationale
of
the
decision
makes
it
clear
that
the
reason
that
the
tax
was
upheld,
contrary
to
the
prior
three
sections
of
the
opinion;
in
other
words,
we
are
talking
about
section
4
of
the
opinion
right
now,
in
the
prior
three
sections
we
are
discussing
situations
where
the
direct
legal
incidents
of
the
montana
taxes
under
consideration
there
were
upon
indians.
on
the
contrary,
with
respect
to
sales
to
non-indians
in
montana,
the
legal
incidents
of
the
tax
was
upon
them.
and
this
pre-collection
requirement
was
not
as
a
result
of
contract
or
anything
like
that,
but
by
mandate
of
state
law.
so
we
view
the
moe
case
as
being
highly
relevant
in
that
regard.
with
respect,
again,
to
mr.
margold's
memorandum
of
february
4,
1938,
if
one
goes
even
further
to
examine
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
that
memorandum,
it
will
be
discovered
that
almost
without
exception,
at
least
to
the
extent
i
have
had
time
to
do
the
research
on
it,
the
impression
that
existed
with
respect
to
that
opinion
was
that
invariably
a
sales
tax
was
a
vendee
responsibility
tax.
in
the
context
of
that
opinion,
he
was
talking
about
the
utah
sales
tax.
the
utah
sales
tax
at
that
time
was
a
vendee
responsibility
tax.
this
is
also
true
with
respect
to
the
buck
act
legislative
history
with
respect
to,
for
example,
congressman
dempsey's
view
as
to
the
application
of
the
sales
tax.
he
makes
some
references
to
this
tax
is
required
to
be
collected
by
the
vendor
and
remitted
to
the
state.
that
is
true.
he
was
from
new
mexico.
at
that
time
new
mexico
had
a
vendee
responsibility
to
sales
tax.
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
the
discussion
of
the
situation
surrounding
legislative
history
of
the
buck
act
one
finds
upon
an
examination
of
the
facts
that
i
have
been
able
to
discover
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
overriding
concern
of
the
people
who
are
testifying
with
respect
to
the
buck
act
was
over
legal
incidents
of
state
taxes
required
by
mandate
of
state
law
to
be
imposed
upon
indians.
those
were
impermissible,
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
indians
on
the
reservation
are
exempt
from
the
direct
legal
application
of
state
loss.
but
there
is
nothing,
i
would
submit,
in
the
histories
of
either
the
hayden-cartwright
act
or
the
buck
act
and,
indeed,
the
indications
are
just
the
contrary,
of
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
insulate
indians
from
non-discriminatory,
contractually
assumed
coats,
just
like
anybody
else.
arizona
does
not
have
at
least,
with
respect
to
the
pinetop
situation,
no
requirement
of
state
law
whatsoever,
that
these
taxes
be
passed
on
and
visited
upon
an
indian
entity.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
somehow
the
hayden-cartwright
act
does
not
apply
because
supposedly
there
is
no
sale
occurring
on
the
reservation,
arizona
would
submit
that
that
simply
does
not
comport
with
the
legislative
intent
as
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act.
quite
the
contrary,
the
legislative
history
as
demonstrated
through
mr.
margold's
opinion,
supports
the
notion
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
various
amendments
that
it
made
after
the
initial
enactment
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act
rather
than
restrict
the
rights
of
the
states,
to
expand
the
rights
of
the
states
to
impose
these
taxes
even
on
indian
reservations.
we
have
cited,
and
do
has
the
united
states'
amicus
curiae
decisions
in
the
age
corporation
case
as
well
as
sanders
v.
oklahoma
tax
commission,
interestingly
enough
by
way
of
brief
--
correction
--
it
should
be
noted
that
on
page
13
of
the
reply
brief
the
citation
is
made
to
the
decision
state
v.
yellowstone
state
park
co.,
well,
by
way
of
correction
i
am
sure
it
is
a
typographical
error,
the
decision
was
not
made
in
1972,
thereby
suggesting
it
is
a
more
recent
decision
than
is
the
decision
in
sanders,
it
was
made
in
1942.
this
court
denied
cert
in
that
case
in
1942.
it
also
denied
cert
in
the
sanders
case
which
reaches
an
opposite
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
hayden-cartwright
act,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
sale,
in
1946.
so
it
remains
the
state
of
the
state
of
arizona's
position
that
the
better
recent
view
is
as
set
forth
in
age
court
in
sanders
v.
oklahoma
tax
commission.
by
way
of
summary,
if
i
may,
the
area
that
has
been
preempted
here
is
not
the
area
of
contractual
negotiation
between
tribe
and
non-indian
entities.
the
area
that
has
been
preempted
is
that
of
sound
civil-cultural
forestry
management.
if
the
state
of
arizona
were
attempting
to
tell
them
and
where
they
could
get
trees
this
would
be
a
very
different
case.
we
are
not.
we
are
dealing
only
with
a
non-indian
entity
who
is
hauling
logs
on
the
reservation.
the
state
of
arizona's
position
is
that
those
taxes
are
value
imposed.
with
that,
are
there
any
further
questions?
well,
thank
you.
