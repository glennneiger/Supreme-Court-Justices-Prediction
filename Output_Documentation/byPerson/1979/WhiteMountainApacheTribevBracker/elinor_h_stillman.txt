ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
state
of
arizona
may
not
impose
its
motor
carrier
license
tax
or
its
use
fuel
tax
on
the
logging
and
hauling
activities
of
petitioner
pinetop
logging
company
on
the
reservation
of
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe.
that
position
rests
we
believe
on
a
number
of
mutually
reinforcing
considerations
and
it
is
no
answer
to
our
argument
to
examine
anyone
in
particular
and
to
say
that
it
is
insufficient
to
validate
the
taxes.
before
discussing
those
particular
considerations
in
this
case,
however,
i
would
like
to
examine
or
identify
the
barter
principles
that
underly
our
analysis,
hoping
to
show
the
court
that
in
fact
it
rests
securely
on
principles
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
recent
indian
tax
decisions.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
i
assume
that
this
is
very
much
tied
to
the
reservation
locus
and
i
will
explain
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
before
discussing
those
considerations
here,
however,
i
wish
to
identify
these
broader
principles.
these
principles
have
been
summarized
in
this
court's
decisions
in
warren
trading
post,
in
mcclanahan,
in
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
in
moe
v.
confederated
salish
and
kootenai
tribes.
first,
as
moe
and
mescalero
made
quite
clear,
federal
instrumentality
doctrine
no
longer
answers
questions
in
this
area
and
we
do
not
rely
on
federal
instrumentality
doctrine
at
all,
which
is
to
say
we
don't
say
simply
because
a
burden
falls
on
a
tribe
which
has
a
connection
with
the
federal
government
that
that
alone
invalidates
a
tax.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
indian
--
i
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
i
don't
concede
that,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
wish
to
adopt
and
rely
on
the
remarks
by
mr.
claiborne
with
respect
to
the
indian
commerce
clause.
our
position
does
not
rely
on
that
doctrine.
second,
although
the
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty
is
still
relevant
it
is
now
defined
to
a
large
extent
by
treaties
and
by
federal
law.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
mcclanahan
and
in
the
year
since
wooster
v.
georgia
notions
of
indian
sovereignty
have
been
adjusted
to
take
account
of
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
the
affairs
of
non-indians.
but
to
adjust
something
is
not
to
eliminate
it.
and
when
you
are
talking
about
state
regulation
of
affairs
of
non-indians
that
take
place
upon
a
reservation
you
simply
cannot
automatically
assume
that
they
have
impunity
to
do
what
they
wish
to
the
non-indians.
the
court
considering
whether
a
particular
exercise
of
state
power
on
a
reservation
must
take
account
of
the
claims
of
tribal
sovereignty
as
well
as
the
customary
powers
of
the
state
in
dealing
with
its
residents.
two
tests
for
making
this
determination
have
been
suggested
by
the
court's
decisions
in
warren
trading
post
and
in
williams
v.
lee.
the
first
test
is
does
the
exercise
of
state
power
in
some
way
--
is
in
some
way
preempted
by
federal
scheme.
and
the
second
test
is
does
it
in
some
way
infringe
on
tribal
self-government.
the
two
tests
are
independent
and
the
state's
power
may
be
defeated
by
either
one.
nevertheless,
the
two
are
not
necessarily
unconnected
and
we
believe
that
is
in
the
circumstance
of
the
present
case
federal
law
may
reflect
a
judgment
of
congress
concerning
what
conditions
are
essential
to
the
continuing
existence
of
tribal
self-government.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
they
are
independent
but
they
may
at
sometimes
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
sometimes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
no,
i
can
understand
that
might
be
a
superficial
analysis.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
we
are
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
i
believe
this
court
has
always
talked
about
a
quasi-sovereignty,
a
dependent
sovereignty.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
quasi-independence.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that
is
correct;
yes.
and
what
i
mentioned
--
when
i
talk
about
tribal
self-government
and
tribal
sovereignty
i
am
referring
to
that
concept.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
state
actions
likely
to
undermine
the
conditions
which
would
--
which
congress
in
its
scheme
has
defined
as
essential
to
preserving
the
tribal
government
of
its
own
relation
within
its
reservation
would
fail
both
tests.
of
course
as
the
court
observed
in
bryan
v.
itaska
county
the
government
can
also
authorize
the
state
in
derogation
of
this
sovereignty
and
if
it
does,
you
might
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
fails
the
infringement
test
and
then
is
saved
by
some
sort
of
congressional
authorization.
we
believe
that
the
taxes
at
issue
in
the
present
case
fail
both
of
the
first
two
tests
and
are
not
saved
by
the
third.
first,
as
we
have
explained
in
our
brief,
a
comprehensive
network
of
laws
and
regulations
governs
the
operation
of
tribal
timber
enterprises
which
are
conceived
of
as
a
means
of
securing
a
secure
economic
base
for
the
continued
self-government
of
tribes
having
extensive
timber
lands
on
their
reservations
and
for
providing
a
source
of
employment
for
tribal
members
within
their
reservations.
in
other
words,
as
we
conceive
the
federal
scheme
here
it
is
not
just
a
scheme
for
cutting
down
timber
and
supervising
roads.
it
is
a
scheme
for
making
these
tribal
timber
enterprises
a
basis
for
making
the
tribe
self-sufficient
within
their
reservation
for
their
members
within
their
reservation
and
make
it
a
going
concern.
now,
the
arizona
taxes
at
issue
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
except
that
the
tribe
has
found,
and
i
believe
this
is
in
the
record
in
one
of
the
affidavits,
that
it
is
not
economical
for
them
to
try
it.
they
did
try
it
at
one
place
in
the
reservation
and
found
that
it
cost
them
more
than
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
speculative.
i
am
not
sure
what
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
don't
know
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes;
right.
i
am
not
sure
as
to
what
extent
that
would
be
the
case.
the
arizona
taxes
at
issue
here
would
fall
upon
all
of
the
logging
contractors,
not
just
pinetop;
and
can
reasonably
be
assumed
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
passed
on
to
the
tribe.
i
don't
think
that
is
really
contested.
the
state
argues
instead
that
legal
incidence
is
what
makes
a
difference.
the
record
does
not
show
what
all
of
those
taxes
have
amounted
to
in
any
given
year.
but
the
important
point
is
this.
the
tax
rate
is
determined
by
the
state
quite
independently
of
what
the
tribe's
balance
sheet
might
show
in
any
given
year.
it
is
just
an
uncontrollable
financial
burden
that
could
be
quite
substantial
and
is
inconsistent
with
what
we
think
is
the
thrust
of
the
federal
scheme.
second,
the
taxes
infringe
on
tribal
sovereignty
and
they
do
so
in
two
ways.
as
we
have
argued,
they
interfere
with
scheme
that
congress
has
devised
to
foster
and
assure
a
viable
tribal
self-government.
and
they
also
represent
an
intrusion
into
the
geographical
territory
of
the
tribe
without
the
warrant
of
any
strong
state
interest
other
than
the
desire
to
augment
its
general
revenues.
now,
the
argument
here
is
almost
somewhat
metaphysical.
i
think
that
is
something
of
what
makes
indian
law
a
little
difficult
and
complicated.
it
is
a
notion
of
what
it
means
for
a
sovereign
or
a
quasi-sovereign
to
have
authority
over
its
territory.
and
although
the
tribes
clearly
do
not
have
absolute
authority
of
their
territory,
cannot
block
the
state
at
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
nevertheless
it
says
something
in
derogation,
in
serious
derogation
of
its
powers
over
its
territory
for
the
state
to
come
onto
the
reservation
and
tax
some
activity
with
no
interest,
no
legitimate
interest,
no
regulatory
interest
other
than
just
a
desire
for
more
money.
it
is
just
a
treatment
of
the
boundaries
as
if
they
can
be
casually
passed
over
without
any
seriousness
to
do
so.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
in
moe,
yes,
i
think
it
is,
because
in
moe
what
you
had
on
the
sale
of
the
indian
trader
to
the
non-indians
was
a
serious
state
interest
in
having
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
but
what
was
happening
there
i
believe
the
state
there
was
losing
revenue
that
had
otherwise
people
would
be
coming
onto
the
reservation
to
buy
things
that
they
otherwise
would
have
bought
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
is
not
talismatic
but
i
am
saying
that
the
weight
of
the
state's
interest
has
some
significance
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
we
would
rest
upon
--
i
would
assume
that
the
argument
made
in
our
brief
in
central
arizona
machinery
would
apply
here
as
well.
we
thought
that
in
this
case
that
regulatory
scheme
required
somewhat
longer
examination
and
we
didn't
make
that
argument
here.
the
taxes
here,
third,
we
do
not
think
have
been
authorized
by
congress
either
in
the
buck
act
or
in
the
hayden-cartwright
act.
for
reasons
that
this
court
found
convincing
in
the
warren
trading
post
case
it
found
that
the
buck
act
does
not
apply
to
a
tax
on
someone
on
an
indian
reservation
who
is
selling
to
indians.
and
that
is
what
the
gross
receipts
tax,
the
motor
carrier
license
tax
here
is
absolutely
in
many
ways
identical
to
the
tax
here.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
