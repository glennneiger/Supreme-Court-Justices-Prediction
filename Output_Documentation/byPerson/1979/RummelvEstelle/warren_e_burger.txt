chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
78-6386,
rummel
v.
estelle,
the
director
of
texas
department
of
corrections.
mr.
atlas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
these
were
three
bank
robbery
convictions,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
are
casting
your
entire
case
on
the
nature
of
the
offense
which
the
state
of
texas
through
its
legislature
has
declared
to
be
a
felony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it,
too,
that
--
well,
i
will
put
it
to
you
as
a
question.
suppose
in
each
of
these
cases
you
had
exactly
the
same
amount
involved,
that
it
was
the
theft
of
a
welfare
check
going
to
a
welfare
recipient,
what
would
be
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
these
were
street
robberies,
at
the
point
of
a
gun,
in
exactly
the
same
amounts,
what
would
be
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
this
court
or
any
other
reviewing
court
should
not
take
judicial
notice
of
the
tiny,
tiny
percentage
of
life
sentences
that
are
in
fact
served
as
life
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn't
you
say,
i
thought
you
said
that
if
they
had
been
offenses
committed
at
gunpoint
they
would
not
be
petty
even
though
the
amounts
were
precisely
the
same
as
involved
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
does
the
amount
have
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
have
referred
in
the
brief
and
to
some
extent
in
your
argument
to
the
death
penalty
cases,
where
the
proportionality
concept
was
introduced.
is
it
not
true
that
in
all
the
discussion
of
proportionality
in
the
death
case
opinions,
this
is
linked
with
the
irreversibility
of
the
punishment,
and
is
it
not
true
that
the
whole
concept
of
parole
and
probation
is
to
make
adjustments
after
the
judgment
and
after
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
dealing
with
one
parking
ticket
or
three
parking
tickets
here,
are
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
not
dealing
with
them
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
haven't
taken
that
step.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
atlas,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
