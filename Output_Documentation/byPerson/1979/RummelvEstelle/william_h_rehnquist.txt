justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
constitution
or
cases
of
this
court
do
you
find
the
distinction
between
money
taken
by
violence
or
crimes
committed
accompanied
by
violence
and
perhaps
very
significant
white
collar
fraud
that
didn't
involve
a
bit
of
violence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
turns
on
the
number
in
effect,
if
it
were
seven
rather
than
three,
the
case
should
come
out
differently?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
atlas,
isn't
the
state
entitled
to
impose
a
much
severer
penalty
even
though
the
facts
are
exactly
as
you
state,
because
its
judgment
is
that
after
three
of
these
type
of
offenses
the
person
is
one
who
is
simply
unable
to
conform
his
conduct
to
social
norms
in
a
way
--
the
basic
rationale
for
a
recidivist
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
becker,
you
could
make
exactly
the
same
argument
about
the
coker
case,
couldn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
becker,
i
got
the
impression
from
reading
both
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
prevailing
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
and
from
both
you
and
your
opponent's
brief
that
you
chose
to
make
"real
world"
arguments
when
it
suited
your
purpose
and
kind
of
abandon
them
when
they
didn't.
mr.
rummel
has
been
sentenced
to
a
term
of
life,
has
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
argument
is
in
effect
a
real
world
one
that
he
doesn't
really
stand
to
serve
that
if
you
take
the
percentages
into
account.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nonetheless,
i
take
it
you
don't
equate
the
term
"punishment"
as
used
in
the
eighth
amendment
with
the
normal
context
of
the
word
"sentence"
independent
of
parole
possibilities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
eight
amendment
forbids
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
as
we
all
know.
you
are
not
saying
i
take
it
--
and
i
understood
that
mr.
atlas
was
not
saying
either
--
that
that
means
you
look
only
to
the
sentence
and
not
at
all
to
the
possibilities
of
parole,
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
life
or
less
sentence
rather
than
death
sentence
with
its
irreversible
aspect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
would
think
the
grand
jury
would
be
inclined
to
indict
when
they
are
shown
all
of
the
necessary
elements
of
texas
recidivism
statutes
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
agree,
mr.
atlas,
that
the
term
"punishment"
in
the
eighth
amendment
means
more
than
just
sentence,
that
parole
possibilities
under
certain
circumstances
can
be
taken
into
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
means
cruel
and
unusual
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
a
life
sentence
for
somebody
who
behaved
himself
in
the
penitentiary
and
showed
every
sign
of
rehabilitation
and
adjustment
as
a
good
citizen
for
these
offenses
might
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
whereas
a
sentence
of
ten
to
twelve
years
upon
such
a
person
might
not
be.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
rummel
against
estelle,
petitioner
william
james
rummel
sought
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
from
his
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
on
the
grounds
that
such
a
sentence
was
so
grossly
disproportionate
to
his
crimes
that
it
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
both
the
district
court
and
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
rummel's
claim
and
today
we
affirm
those
determinations.
in
1964,
rummel
pleaded
guilty
in
the
state
of
texas
to
a
charge
of
fraudulent
use
of
a
credit
card
to
obtain
$80
worth
of
goods
and
services.
under
texas
law,
such
an
offense
was
a
felony
punishable
by
two
to
10
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
and
rummel
was
sentenced
to
three
years.
in
1969,
after
his
release
from
the
penitentiary,
rummel
pleaded
guilty
to
passing
a
forged
check
in
the
amount
of
$28.36.
like
his
earlier
offense,
this
crime
was
a
felony
under
texas
law
and
was
punishable
by
two
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
in
fact,
rummel
received
a
sentence
of
four
years
for
this
offense.
in
1973,
after
being
released
from
the
penitentiary
a
second
time,
rummel
was
charged
with
obtaining
$120.75
by
false
pretenses.
again,
the
amount
involved
established
this
crime
as
a
felony
under
texas
law
which
set
a
potential
punishment
for
that
crime
alone
of
two
to
10
years
or
--
in
prison.
because
rummel
had
been
convicted
of
and
imprison
of
for
two
--
imprisoned
for
two
prior
felonies,
however,
the
prosecution
decided
to
invoke
texas'
recidivist
statute
which
provided
that
upon
conviction
of
a
third
felony,
the
offender
should
be
imprisoned
for
life
subject
only
to
the
state's
judgment
whether
to
release
him
on
parole.
rummel
was
in
fact
convicted
of
the
charge
defense
and
was
sentenced
to
serve
such
a
term
of
life
imprisonment.
in
holding
that
the
state
of
texas
could
consistent
with
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments
imposed
a
life
sentence
upon
a
person
in
rummel's
position.
we
rely
on
a
number
of
factors
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
in
detail
in
the
court
today.
while
we
recognize
that
only
two
other
states,
washington
and
west
virginia
would
have
required
a
life
sentence
in
a
case
like
rummel's,
many
other
states
have
recidivist
statutes
that
differ
from
those
in
texas,
washington
and
west
virginia
only
in
subtle
matters
of
degree.
thus
the
number
of
states
would
have
allowed
a
judge
or
jury
to
impose
the
sentence
upon
rummel
on
no
discretion.
other
states
would
have
required
a
life
sentence
if
one
of
rummel's
crimes
had
involved
some
degree
of
violence
or
if
he
had
committed
four
rather
than
three
felonies.
absent
genuinely
and
measurable
objective
criteria
demonstrating
that
rummel's
sentence
was
grossly
out
of
proportion
either
to
his
offense
or
to
the
sentence
he
would
receive
in
other
states,
we
do
not
think
the
constitution
allows
us
to
hold
that
the
texas
legislature
exceeded
its
authority
in
deciding
that
a
person
with
rummel's
criminal
record
should
be
sent
to
prison
for
life
subject
only
to
the
state's
judgment
is
to
when
to
release
him
on
parole.
mr
.justice
stewart
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined.
