justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
embezzlement?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
it,
you
just
drew
the
line,
and
embezzlement
certainly
falls
on
the
nonviolent
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
tax
evasion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
three
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
absolutely
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
it
is
completely
nonviolent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
just
a
compulsive
con
man
who
just
goes
around
conning
people
out
of
money,
with
false
schemes,
especially
children
and
old
ladies,
there
are
a
lot
of
those
around,
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
take
three.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
up
to
the
state
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
texas
will
come
around
to
that
point
of
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
the
examples
in
the
other
states.
you've
compared
texas
now
to
the
other
states.
how
do
you
compare
the
good
time
provisions
in
texas
with
those
in
other
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
that
you
are
just
suggesting
we
disregard
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
as
what
the
likelihood
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fifth
circuit
knows
more
about
local
law
and
practice
than
we
do
and
decided
that
the
chances
were
so
high
that
he
would
get
out
that
we
should
take
it
into
consideration,
and
you
think
if
it
were
100
percent
chance
we
should.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
keep
emphasizing
the
discretion.
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
whatever,
however
it
reads
on
the
books,
the
practice
is
that
it
isn't,
whatever
the
discretion
is,
it
is
a
very
narrow
realm
of
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
way
it
operates,
it
almost
always
operates
in
favor
of
the
prisoner.
justice
byron
r.
white
general
becker,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
remember
the
opinion,
started
with
the
assumption
that
the
length
of
sentence
could
be
sufficient
to
violate
the
eighth
amendment
even
in
a
non-death
case.
do
you
accept
that
premise?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
distinction,
of
course,
doesn't
stand
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
be
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
in
death
cases
is
it
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
the
probability
that
the
sentence
will
actually
be
inflicted?
as
i
think
we
probably
all
know,
it
is
very
rare
for
the
death
penalty
actually
to
be
carried
out.
is
that
a
factor
we
should
think
about
in
death
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
we
assume
that
in
90
percent
of
the
death
cases
either
the
governor
will
commute
the
sentence
or
it
will
be
set
aside
for
one
reason
or
another,
we
should
not
take
that
into
account
in
that
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
man
is
one
of
the
10
percent
who
doesn't
get
an
early
parole?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
becker,
on
the
question
of
getting
into
the
sentence
review
business
at
all
--
of
course,
i
agree
with
you,
if
you
view
the
case
as
one
of
a
ten
or
twelve
year
sentence,
it
is
quite
different
than
if
you
just
view
it
in
terms
of
the
legal
rights
and
the
lifetime
--
what
would
your
view
be
if
you
did
not
have
this
kind
of
parole
provision
or
if
as
a
matter
of
law
we
decided
we
would
just
have
to
look
at
the
sentence
cold
and
not
in
the
real
world,
as
justice
rehnquist
puts
it,
would
you
say
it
would
be
up
to
us
to
review
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole
for
this
kind
of
group
of
offenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
get
the
federal
court
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
did
apply
proportionality,
if
the
sentence
here
were
properly
viewed
as
a
life
sentence
rather
than
one
of
ten
or
twelve
years,
would
you
agree
that
that
would
be
excessive?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
rely
then
on
the
--
you
don't
have
to
rely
in
your
view
on
the
probability
of
parole
as
part
of
your
defense
statutory
scheme?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
basically
two
different
theories.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
equally
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
the
label
of
felony
can
be
determinative,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
becker,
just
to
refresh
my
recollection,
judge
clark's
initial
panel
opinion,
wasn't
the
relief
that
he
granted
that
you
vacate
the
mandatory
sentence
and
send
it
back
for
resentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
resentencing
hearing,
would
it
not
have
been
open
to
the
state
to
put
in
whatever
would
be
relevant
for
resentencing,
including
these
additional
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
already
protected
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
normally
in
a
sentencing
hearing
in
texas
you
can
put
in
all
sorts
of
prior
convictions.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
atlas,
could
i
ask
if
we
agree
with
you,
what
should
be
our
disposition
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
even
if
the
court
in
its
wisdom
thought
that
30
years
would
be
a
good
sentence
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
texas
couldn't
under
its
law
impose
30
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
texas
could
be
ordered
to
treat
him
as
though
he
had
a
30-year
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
our
standard
should
be
violent
crimes
generally
but
there
are
some
other
strong
social
interests.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
should
go
on
just
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
from
then
on
to
decide
what
is
a
strong
social
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
help
us
by
suggesting
some
--
how
do
we
identify
one
of
those
when
we
run
into
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
--
if
the
prosecutor
here
had
simply
put
in
the
indictment
six
or
seven
crimes,
even
though
petty
crimes,
if
there
were
that
many,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
would
you
be
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
seven
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way
suppose
the
judges
in
the
texas
courts
construed
the
law
differently
than
you
do,
the
texas
law,
that
you
may
put
seven
in
the
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
if
there
is
a
conviction,
would
you
be
here
then?
