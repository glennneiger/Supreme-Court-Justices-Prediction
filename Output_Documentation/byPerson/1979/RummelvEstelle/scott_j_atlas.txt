mr.
scott
j.
atlas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
scott
atlas,
court
appointed
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
william
james
rummel.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
texas
habitual
offender
statute,
which
since
1856
has
mandated
an
automatic
life
sentence
upon
third
felony
conviction,
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
as
applied
to
the
three
offenses
for
which
my
client
received
his
life
sentence.
the
facts
are
simply
stated.
in
1964,
at
the
age
of
21,
rummel
pleaded
guilty
to
buying
four
tires
at
a
gas
station,
worth
$80,
with
a
credit
card
that
wasn't
his.
in
1969,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
forging
a
$28.36
check
to
pay
rent
at
a
hotel.
and
in
1972,
he
accepted
a
$120.75
check
and
promised
to
fix
an
air-conditioner,
didn't
do
it
and
in
1973
a
jury
convicted
him
in
essence
of
not
intending
to
do
it
when
he
accepted
the
check.
in
the
state
trial
court,
after
the
conviction,
the
jury
found
that
he
had
committed
the
two
prior
felonies
and
the
judge
assessed
him
the
automatic
life
sentence
required
under
texas
law.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
question.
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
question
on
ineffective
counsel
that
is
not
before
this
court,
but
it
has
not
been
decided
and
is
still
languishing
in
the
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
for
present
purposes,
this
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
each
of
the
three
offenses
were
felonies
at
the
time
they
were
committed.
the
third
felony,
the
$120
check
offense
became
a
misdemeanor
eight
months
later,
punishable
by
a
maximum
of
only
one
year.
but
at
the
time
it
was
committed
--
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
also
true
with
the
first
offense,
the
credit
card
offense
--
at
the
time
each
of
the
three
offenses
were
committed,
they
were
felonies
under
texas
law
and
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
the
statute
was
properly
applied
according
to
the
dictates
of
the
statute.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
that
is
clearly
the
most
difficult
analytical
problem
in
this
case,
and
my
answer
is
not
a
perfect
one.
i
think
i
would
still
be
here
arguing
in
this
court
that
the
harm
to
the
victims,
since
it
is
normally
irrelevant
at
the
sentencing
stage
unless
it
forms
part
of
the
substantive
offense,
is
also
irrelevant
at
the
conviction
stage
that
it
ought
not
to
be
a
factor
for
this
court.
nonetheless,
i
realize
that
that
created
by
far
the
most
difficult
analytical
problem,
but
i
think
that
since
stealing
the
$200
or
whatever
the
amount
would
be
from
a
welfare
victim
presumably
constitutes
the
same
offense
under
texas
law,
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
victim,
we
would
argue
that
the
offenses
would
make
no
difference
in
this
court's
analysis.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
my
position
would
be
very
different
and
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
and
we
contend
to
this
court
that
if
there
was
any
element
of
violence
or
potential
violence
in
any
one
of
the
three
offenses,
that
this
court
ought
not
to
consider
the
issue
because
the
state
of
texas
is
entitled
to
pass
judgment
of
a
life
sentence,
even
automatic,
on
anyone
convicted
of
an
offense
that
involves
a
violent
offense
such
as
the
bank
robberies
or
street
robberies
that
you
mentioned,
regardless
of
whether
any
money
was
taken
successfully
or
not.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
first
let
me
clarify
my
point
a
bit.
when
i
say
that
if
the
offenses,
any
one
of
them
are
violent,
that
that
ought
to
mean
the
case
should
not
be
in
this
court,
i
do
not
mean
that
those
are
the
only
circumstances
under
which
the
court
ought
not
to
consider
an
eighth
amendment
claim
given
a
mandatory
life
sentence.
there
are
certain
offenses
i
think
in
addition
to
violent
offenses
--
for
example,
drug
crimes,
and
certain
other
crimes
where
the
state
has
a
peculiarly
strong
interest
--
nonetheless,
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
there
is
nothing
specifically
written
in
the
constitution.
we
would
argue
that
the
eighth
amendment
ought
to
apply
to
a
lengthy
sentence
under
certain
circumstances
and
in
attempting
to
develop
some
type
of
objective
criteria
we
have
relied
on
the
court's
decisions
and
the
rules
prescribed
in
various
death
penalty
and
non-death
penalty
cases,
in
particular
the
court's
1977
coker
decision
which
talked
about
the
disproportionate
nature
of
offenses
to
the
punishment
given,
and
we
would
argue
that
in
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
offenses
that
any
time
an
offense
involves
violence
or
some
element
of
violence
or
threat
off
violence,
that
since
those
kinds
of
offenses
are
always
punished
much
more
seriously
in
every
state
in
this
country,
then
the
kind
of
nonviolent
petty
property
crimes
with
which
this
court
is
dealing
in
this
case,
that
that
ought
to
be
some
indication,
although
not
the
final
answer,
in
and
of
itself
that
the
sentence
is
excessive.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
embezzlement
again
gives
me
somewhat
more
trouble
than
the
normal
petty
check
offense.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
but,
mr.
justice
white,
embezzlement
cases
we
think
generally
probably
have
much
more
of
an
indication
of
professional
criminality,
and
we
would
argue
that
if
we
are
dealing
with
professional
criminals,
someone
who
forges
three
$100,000
checks
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
tax
evasion,
i
think
al
capone
is
perhaps
a
perfect
example.
the
first
time
al
capone
was
caught,
they
threw
away
the
key.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
three
times,
absolutely
if
you
could
ever
find
someone.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
absolutely
the
court
ought
not
to
consider
an
eighth
amendment
claim
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
represents
an
interest
in
which
the
state
has
a
peculiarly
strong
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
tax
process
and
we
feel
it
is
probably
entitled
to
receive
special
treatment
by
the
court.
judge
clark
in
the
fifth
circuit
panel,
and
again
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
in
this
case
made
it
clear
that
not
only
when
the
offenses
involved
violence
but
also
when
there
was
a
strong
social
interest
in
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
mandated
a
life
sentence
upon
conviction
of
a
sufficient
number
of
offenses
to
entitle
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
under
those
circumstances
would
not
be
entitled
to
make
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
someone
is
a
lifetime
con
man
and
deem
him
beyond
redemption,
justifying
the
mandatory
life
sentence
subject
only
to
the
parole
board's
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
statute
mandated
life
after
seven,
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
problem
arguing
the
state's
conclusion
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
by
far
the
most
difficult
line
drawing
question
here.
i
can't
tell
this
court
where
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
i
can
only
tell
this
court
that
wherever
that
line
is
drawn,
it
ought
not
be
at
three.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
no
statute
in
this
country
at
this
time
in
which
someone
receives
an
automatic
life
sentence
upon
conviction
or
any
more
than
four
felonies.
there
are
30
states
only
where
one
receives
an
automatic
life
sentence
for
four,
and
there
is
only
one
state
now
as
a
practical
matter,
as
i
have
discussed
in
my
brief,
i
have
distinguished
washington
and
west
virginia,
because
of
court
decisions
or
court
language
in
those
states.
texas
is
the
only
state
now
as
a
practical
matter
where
one
would
receive
an
automatic
life
sentence
for
these
three
felonies,
and
we
would
argue
that
since
one
of
the
criteria
outlined
by
this
court
in
the
1977
coker
case
and
then
mentioned
at
various
times
by
other
members
of
this
court
in
other
decisions,
is
looking
at
not
only
the
nature
of
the
offenses
but
the
trend
in
other
states
and
the
manner
in
which
other
states
punish
the
same
offenses,
but
since
we
have
been
able
to
trace
out
for
this
court
every
habitual
offender
statute
ever
enacted
in
this
country
in
the
last
200
years,
and
since
it
is
clear
that
a
number
of
other
states,
perhaps
17
i
believe
have
attempted
to
punish
prisoners
with
an
automatic
life
sentence
upon
a
certain
number
of
nonviolent
felony
convictions,
and
every
one
of
those
states,
one
after
another
over
the
course
of
the
years
has
decided
that
either
the
statute
didn't
work
or
it
was
unfair
and
now
texas
stands
alone
by
itself.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
123
years
is
long
enough
for
texas
to
come
around
to
that
point
of
view.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
attorney
general's
office
has
provided
us
with
charts
that
according
to
the
attorney
general's
office
suggest
that
texas
is
more
liberal
in
its
good
time
credit.
that
in
and
of
itself
first
of
all
nought
not
to
be
considered
by
this
court
since
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion,
but
even
if
the
court
considers
good
time
credit
alone,
that
is
not
enough
to
affect
rummel's
sentence
one
bit.
all
that
does,
for
someone
who
is
given
a
life
sentence,
is
move
up
the
time
when
parole
becomes
a
possibility.
it
does
not
affect
at
all
the
time
at
which
my
client
would
be
entitled
to
release
because
in
fact
at
no
time
during
his
life
is
he
ever
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right,
either
statutory
or
constitutional,
to
any
consideration
whatsoever
in
terms
of
release.
if
he
had
a
ten-year
sentence,
then
good
time
credit
could
move
up
the
time
where
he
would
have
the
absolute
right
to
release.
the
maximum
possible
good
time
credit
in
texas
might
allow
him
to
be
released
in
five
years,
rather
than
ten,
because
he
could
receive
an
extra
day
for
every
day
he
served
under
the
most
liberal
of
the
good
time
credit
provisions.
but
where
someone
receives
a
life
sentence
under
texas
law,
the
time
for
release
is
never,
and
parole
in
texas
is
something,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
greenholtz
case
last
term,
is
something
completely
within
the
discretion
of
the
state.
as
i
have
indicated
in
the
reply
brief,
the
governor
of
texas
recently
has
been
taking
a
much
more
strict
interpretation
of
the
parole
provisions
and
in
fact
in
june
of
this
year
rejected
79
percent
of
the
parole
board's
recommendations.
the
state
has
argued
that
the
life
sentence
here
is
not
really
a
life
sentence
because
the
parole
board
--
because
mr.
rummel
might
get
good
time
credit
and
move
up
the
time
when
he
is
eligible
for
parole
consideration,
because
then
the
parole
board
might
then
choose
to
recommend
parole
to
the
governor,
and
that
the
governor
might
then
decide
to
exercise
his
prerogative
to
grant
the
parole.
these
are
conditions
under
which
mr.
rummel
has
absolutely
no
right
and
ought
not
to
be
considered
by
this
court
because
if
mr.
rummel
does
not
receive
his
hearing
here
today
he
will
never
receive
it,
this
court
will
never
review
his
parole
determination,
if
it
is
denied
forever.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
court
is
entitled
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that
matter,
but
in
terms
of
the
weight
that
the
court
ought
to
give
that,
we
think
the
weight
ought
to
be
practically
nil
because
there
is
no
right
to
it.
if
the
state
would
guarantee
me
today
that
mr.
rummel
would
absolutely
as
a
matter
of
right
get
out
on
a
certain
day,
then
i
would
not
be
in
this
court,
but
the
state
won't
do
that,
the
statute
doesn't
provide
it,
the
parole
board
won't
promise
it,
and
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor.
if
it
were
100
percent
chance
because
it
were
a
matter
of
right,
absolutely,
but
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
--
and
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
court
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
true
that
it
is
a
very
narrow
realm
of
discretion.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
if
a
governor
comes
into
office
who
chooses
to
cut
back
drastically
on
the
number
of
paroles
granted
among
those
recommended
by
the
parole
board,
then
even
though
the
parole
board
is
exercising
what
you
have
characterized,
mr.
justice
white,
as
very
narrow
discretion,
the
governor
and
the
parole
board
itself,
if
it
changes
its
mind
or
the
members
change
composition
is
entitled
to
exercise
complete
unlimited
discretion.
moreover,
if
mr.
rummel
misbehaves
in
prison
or
demonstrates
a
surly
attitude,
the
parole
board
will
never
parole.
the
factors
upon
which
the
parole
board
bases
its
decision
are
only
remotely
related
to
any
eighth
amendment
considerations,
and
in
many
instances,
as
outlined
in
the
state's
brief
and
in
its
supplement,
are
factors
totally
outside
the
control
of
the
prisoner
himself.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
is
an
absolute
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
maximum,
and
at
some
point
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
absolute
release.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
demonstrated
in
charts,
the
204
pages
--
my
apologies
for
the
length
--
that
we
submitted
to
this
court,
that
in
every
state
except
the
three
i
mentioned,
plus
texas,
the
discretion,
either
the
judge
or
jury
has
discretion
in
sentencing
with
an
absolute
boundary
beyond
which
they
cannot
go.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
after
he
is
incarcerated
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
every
state
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
for
a
certain
amount
of
time,
but
at
some
point
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
absolute
release
when
the
offenses
are
the
same
type
of
offenses
with
which
we
are
dealing
in
this
case.
when
they
are
dealing
with
violent
offenses,
there
may
not
be
an
absolute
maximum
at
all,
and
the
prisoner
may
have
no
rights
to
release
at
any
time
before
the
end
of
his
term.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
but
in
cases
in
every
other
state
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
even
after
a
single
conviction
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
that's
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
only
these
type
of
petty
offenses,
california
and
every
other
state
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
no
question.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
they
are
petty
offenses
we
feel
in
a
constitutional
sense.
we
are
not
arguing
that
mr.
rummel
does
not
deserve
somehow
to
avoid
punishment
for
these
offenses
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
the
amount
has
to
do
with
it
only
to
the
extent
that
it
demonstrates
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
pettiest
type
of
offender,
not
an
organized
criminal,
not
a
member
of
any
organized
gang.
these
are
three
petty,
small,
double-digit
check
offenses,
suggesting
bad
judgment
and
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
absolutely
right.
on
the
one
hand,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
increase
the
punishment
based
on
the
existence
of
prior
offenses.
we
are
simply
saying
this
is
too
much
for
too
little.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
statute
mandated
a
life
sentence
upon
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
parking
ticket,
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
would
find
that
statute
grossly
excessive,
that
punishment
grossly
excessive
considering
the
nature
of
the
offenses.
well,
having
established
the
principle
at
some
point,
we
are
now
really
attempting
to
determine
where
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn,
not
whether,
because
under
some
circumstances
if
the
state
legislature
is
entitled
to
characterize
something
as
criminal
and
entitled
to
punish
the
third
offense,
the
third
commission
of
that
offense
with
a
life
sentence,
then
a
parking
offense
which
states
typically
characterize
as
criminal,
whether
felony
or
misdemeanor,
would
justify
a
life
sentence
under
that
rationale
upon
the
third
commission
of
it,
and
there
is
no
question
that
someone
who
committed
a
third
parking
ticket
or
a
third
speeding
ticket
or
in
texas
the
third
time
you
steal
a
goat,
with
an
automatic
life
sentence,
at
some
point
this
court
will
be
called
in
to
say
that
the
legislature
has
exceeded
constitutional
bounds.
and
we
would
argue
that
in
attempting
to
provide
some
type
of
objective
criteria
for
this
court
to
decide
the
case
and
attempting
to
suggest
some
ways
to
limit
the
inherent
subjectivity
that
is
involved
in
most
constitutional
decisions
and
even
most
peculiarly
in
an
eighth
amendment
decision,
that
the
criteria
that
have
been
outlined
by
the
court
and
that
we
have
attempted
to
demonstrate
we
fulfill,
and
frankly
whatever
test
this
court
chooses
to
adopt
for
evaluating
sentence
length,
we
think
mr.
rummel's
case
makes
it.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
you
are
absolutely
right.
but
if
the
state
should
mandate
a
life
sentence
for
one
parking
ticket
and
yet
held
out
the
possibility
of
parole
in
15
minutes,
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
would
find
that
sentence
excessive,
no
question
of
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
even
three
parking
tickets,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
but
theoretically
they
could
under
the
rationale
that
the
state
has
suggested.
no
question,
death
is
different,
although
in
the
hutto
case
last
term
this
court
mentioned
the
proportionality
analysis
in
the
context
of
a
non-death
case
and
it
has
in
a
number
of
instances.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
it
did
and
that
was
a
non-death
case,
a
falsification
of
government
documents,
although
there
was
no
proof
of
--
and
the
statute
did
not
require
proof
of
any
fraud.
and
we
concede
for
purposes
of
argument
that
williams
is
different.
but
there
is
no
question
but
that
death
is
different
and
we
don't
question
that.
and
perhaps
the
test
ought
to
be
imposed
with
greater
exactitude
in
the
instance
of
the
death
penalty,
but
that
is
a
different
question.
the
test
itself
ought
to
be
the
same.
i
will
reserve
time.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case
we
think
is
to
order
rummel's
immediate
release.
i
have
a
section
in
my
brief
dealing
with
the
very
clear
texas
law
on
the
proper
procedure
in
texas,
but
we
have
no
disagreement
if
it
chooses
to
remand
back
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
--
to
the
district
court
to
find
what
texas
law
properly
would
allow.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
under
texas
law
as
it
happens
we
think
rummel
is
entitled
to
a
completely
new
trial
and
for
various
coincidences
we
think
he
is
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
argue
in
that
instance
that
the
state
would
not
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
it
is
possible
that
the
state
could
enhance
under
the
two-time
offender
statute
of
texas
and
give
mr.
rummel
an
automatic
ten-year
sentence
which
he
has
already
served.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
a
three-time
is
only
permitted
under
texas
to
be
given
a
life
sentence.
there
is
nothing
else
authorized
by
statute.
either
they
can
give
him
the
two-timer
or
sentence
him
for
his
last
offense,
nothing
else.
for
the
state
to
make
these
rather
last-minute
outside
the
record
accusations
is
not
only
irrelevant
because
they
could
not
be
admitted
in
a
habitual
offender
trial
because
they
are
irrelevant,
none
are
potentially
useful
for
enhancement,
none
frankly
have
ever
been
proven
and
they
are
just
accusations
at
this
point.
the
state
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
the
statute
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
under
its
current
law
it
could
not.
it
could
pass
a
new
law
that
mandated
or
allowed
it,
but
it
has
not
gotten.
and
the
alternatives
to
the
state
are
to
give
the
automatic
life
sentence,
if
that
is
invalid
then
find
another
statute
justifying
the
sentence.
they
can
give
as
much
as
they
are
allowed
to
under
the
third
offense,
as
much
as
they
are
allowed
to
for
a
second
felony,
but
not
something
not
allowed
by
statute
of
texas.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
we
think
not
because
that
would
be
judicial
legislation
i
think.
the
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
standard
ought
to
be
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
standard
ought
to
be
--
and
i
think
the
court
could
enact
a
fairly
narrow
standard
if
it
chose
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
pardon
me,
i
misspoke
and
as
badly
as
i
have
ever
done.
the
point
is
if
the
judge
or
jury
had
given
the
sentence
based
on
some
sentencing
discretion,
this
court
need
not
review
it.
if
the
crimes
involved
some
element
of
violence
or
some
of
these
strong
social
interests
that
we
have
talked
about
not
present
here,
then
the
court
need
not
review
it.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
fortunately
from
all
the
research
we
have
done,
we
found
almost
no
cases
where
the
court
would
ever
have
a
case
that
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
fortunately
this
court
has
never
had
one
nor
has
any
other
court
that
has
ever
dealt
with
the
problem.
i
think
the
drug
offenses
are
probably
a
perfect
example
of
that,
because
of
the
problems
that
legislature
normally
deal
with
and
make
fact-findings
about
in
the
legislative
process
explicitly
or
implicitly
before
passing
those
statutes.
the
federalism
problem
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
and
the
potential
so-called
floodgate
problems
that
the
state
refers
to
in
its
brief
are
non-existent.
the
fourth
circuit
decided
in
'73
and
it
has
not
had
a
floodgate
problem.
courts
in
states
that
have
constitutional
provisions
allowing
review
of
statutes
have
reviewed
statutes
and
sentences
for
excessiveness
and
have
not
had
this
flood-gate
problem.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
court
will
never
have
to
face
the
problem
again.
it
has
been
200
years
and
they
have
only
had
one
other
case
argued
before.
as
to
the
parole
argument,
the
state
has
argued
that
the
possibility
of
parole
ought
to
be
considered.
ironically
enough,
mr.
rummel,
if
he
maintains
good
time
credit,
will
become
eligible
on
january
1,
1984.
the
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
at
this
point
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
circumstance
under
which
i
would
support
the
principle
that
parole
consideration
ought
to
be
received
unless
there
is
some
statutory
entitlement,
using
this
court's
language,
that
would
give
mr.
rummel
some
constitutionally
protected
rights
to
be
allowed
to
challenge
the
parole
board's
denial
of
parole
on
whatever
basis
if
the
actual
sentence
that
he
served
exceeded
whatever
would
be
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
among
other
things,
your
honor.
sentence
is
one
part
of
the
mosaic
of
punishment,
only
one.
there
are
obviously
others.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
if
a
life
sentence
is
unconstitutional
for
three
petty
offenses,
it
is
unconstitutional
for
three
petty
offenses
and
a
surly
attitude.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
if
the
legislature
had
sentenced
mr.
rummel
to
the
thumb
screws
but
it
provided
that
they
bring
him
down
if
he
behaved
while
on
the
rack,
we
think
this
court
would
not
approve
the
sentence.
the
state
argues
we
ought
to
view
this
case
in
reality.
as
judge
clark
said
in
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
dissent,
mr.
rummel's
reality
is
that
he
has
a
life
sentence
with
no
guarantee
or
rights
or
expectations
legitimately
that
he
will
ever
get
out.
one
other
criterion
that
the
court
has
discussed
in
its
other
cases,
including
coker,
is
to
examine
the
types
of
punishments
that
texas
provides
for
other
offenses.
there
is
only
one
other
offense
in
the
state
of
texas
for
which
one
receives
an
automatic
life
sentence
and
that
is
capital
murder.
one
can
commit
two
murders
in
texas
and
not
receive
an
automatic
life
sentence
although
presumably
one
would
receive
the
equivalent
to
one
by
a
judge
or
jury.
and
if
rummel
had
received
a
life
sentence
by
a
judge
or
jury
i
wouldn't
be
here,
i
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case.
but
as
we
know
as
a
practical
matter,
no
judge
or
jury
would
have
given
rummel
a
life
sentence
in
this
case
anywhere
in
this
country,
and
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
factors
and
one
of
the
criteria
upon
which
this
court
ought
to
base
its
eighth
amendment
decision.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
the
state
legislature
in
1856
did
not
say
that
three
petty
property
offenses
ought
to
bring
a
life
sentence.
admittedly,
it
is
covered
by
the
statute,
and
i
would
not
want
to
argue
that
the
legislature
did
not
intend
it.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
but
we
think
there
is
only
so
--
in
any
constitutional
decision,
this
court
is
being
asked
in
some
sense
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
and
indirectly
on
the
wisdom
of
the
state
in
passing
such
a
statute.
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
sits
for.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
no,
your
honor,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
a
statute
exceeds
the
constitutional
limits,
and
when
it
does
the
statute
cannot
stand.
the
jury
in
this
case
is
in
texas
under
state
law
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
the
life
sentence
that
the
result
of
its
conviction
will
bring.
it
is
not
clear
that
the
grand
jury
does.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
says
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
sir,
i
would
be
here,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
says
three
felonies,
automatic
life.
the
state
cannot
have
its
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
we
had
--
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
state
says
three,
any
others
are
irrelevant.
the
statute
says
the
jury
and
judge
cannot
consider
extraneous
circumstances
when
passing
on
the
sentence
because
upon
the
proof
of
the
third
the
sentence
is
automatic.
if
we
can't
bring
in
extraneous
circumstances
and
all
the
criteria
and
all
the
other
facts
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
then
the
state
can't
either.
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
scott
j.
atlas
your
honor,
if
the
statute
mandated
life
sentence
upon
seven,
i
would
probably
not
be
here
because
i
would
lose
and
we
cannot
forget
that
under
these
circumstances,
after
all
of
the
criteria
have
been
discussed,
we
are
talking
about
a
human
being
who
was
given
a
life
sentence
for
three
petty
offenses.
