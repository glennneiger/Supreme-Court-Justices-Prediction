justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
becker,
you
spoke
earlier
and
just
repeated
now
that
there
is
nothing
automatic
about
this
recidivist
statute,
that
it
depends
first
of
all
upon
the
discretion
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
whether
or
not
to
ask
for
an
indictment
under
it,
and
i
suppose
that
is
his
absolute
and
uncontrolled
discretion,
principle
discretion,
that
is
there
is
no
statutory
criteria
to
guide
him,
right?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
you
said
that
it
also
depends
upon
the
discretion
of
the
grand
jury,
that
even
if
he
asks
for
such
an
indictment,
the
grand
jury
must
decide
that
this
is
a
proper
case
in
which
to
return
one.
is
the
grand
jury
given
any
guidance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
from
anybody?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
about
the
prosecutor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
uncontrolled,
uncontrollable
and
standardless
discretion,
is
that
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they
are
of
course
unappealable.
