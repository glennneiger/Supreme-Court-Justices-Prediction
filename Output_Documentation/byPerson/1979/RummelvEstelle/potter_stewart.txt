justice

is
there
any
question,
mr.
atlas,
about
the
validity
of
the
any
of
the
three
convictions?
justice
potter
stewart
so
for
present
purposes
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
atlas,
there
are
some
states,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
california
is
one,
where
the
sentence
after
conviction
for
almost
any
felony
is
an
indeterminate
sentence,
and
how
long
the
convict
will
actually
serve
is
in
the
discretion
of
--
i
think
in
california
it
is
called
the
adult
authority,
but
the
parole
board.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
maxima,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
true
in
every
state?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
judge
or
jury.
i'm
talking
about
the
mandatory
sentence
after
he
is
in
custody,
after
he
is
incarcerated,
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
administration
of
the
parole
board
or,
as
is
called
in
california,
the
adult
authority
is
very
great,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
will
serve
the
life
term.
justice
potter
stewart
even
after
a
single
conviction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
felony
involving
violence
he
may
serve
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
these
are
based
in
the
eyes
of
texas,
were
at
the
time
of
conviction
felonies.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
petty
offenses.
justice
potter
stewart
the
williams
case
had
to
do
with
proportionality,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
possible
that
the
decision
was
influenced
by
the
pendency
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
can
the
resentencing
in
that
situation
be
for
a
misdemeanor?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
traffic
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
only
the
prosecutor
and
no
defense
counsel
in
front
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
the
next
time
they
run
thou
won't
be
elected.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
an
impermissible
basis
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
grand
jury
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
general
becker,
just
to
refresh
my
recollection
about
the
texas
procedure,
doesn't
the
statute
require
that
the
prior
offenses
be
identified
in
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
then
how
would
it
have
been
proper
during
the
trial
itself
to
introduce
evidence
of
offenses
not
described
in
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
judge
doesn't
have
any
discretion,
once
you
proved
what
you
did
prove
he
has
an
automatic
duty
to
impose
the
life
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
is
your
submission,
but
i
would
think
that
would
be
not
an
open
and
shut
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
do
we
know
that
as
a
factor?
the
state
legislature
did.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
pass
on
the
wisdom
of
any
state
statute
