question
that
the
line
is
drawn
in
your
case?
justice

general
becker,
help
me
a
little.
you
say
practically
none
of
the
people
ever
serve
their
time.
well,
what
is
the
sense
of
giving
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
sense
of
sentencing
them
to
life
if
he
is
not
going
to
serve
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
so
bad
about
mr.
rummel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
total
of
four.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
going
to
give
him
time
for
the
crimes
he
wasn't
convicted
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
sentence
him
to
death
while
you
are
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
remove
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
one
way
would
be
to
give
him
some
training
in
jail.
that
would
be
one
way,
which
texas
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
a
great
extent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
use
the
word
"great"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
get
anybody
else
to
join
you
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
couldn't
all
of
that
have
been
revoked
by
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
material
that
you
are
talking
about,
was
that
before
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
arguing
it
here
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
right
do
you
have
to
argue
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that?
where
can
we
presume
that
a
man
has
committed
offenses?
i
thought
a
man
was
presumed
to
be
innocent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
want
us
to
presume?
