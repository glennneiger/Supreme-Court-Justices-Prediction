mr.
douglas
m.
becker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
douglas
becker,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas,
attorney
for
the
state
of
texas
in
this
habeas
corpus
matter.
your
honors,
the
state
of
texas
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
federalism,
a
question
of
--
questions
of
federalism
have
often
appeared
before
the
court
in
years
past,
but
we
feel
that
rarely
has
a
case
ever
cried
out
for
judicial
restraint
and
the
application
of
a
doctrine
that
is
attractive
at
first
glance
to
some
because
of
the
seeming
oppressive
nature
of
mr.
rummel's
sentence
in
light
of
his
convictions,
but
which
would
have
effects
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
texas
and
indeed
throughout
the
nation,
that
would
make
the
costs
of
such
a
system
far
outweigh
any
supposed
benefits.
now,
we
feel
that
in
the
first
place
the
holding
contended
for
by
mr.
rummel
in
this
case
would
be
a
usurpation
of
traditional
prosecutorial
discretion
in
authority
that
has
prevailed
in
this
country
and
indeed
in
england
and
which
prevails
today
in
virtually
all
the
states.
the
prosecutors
in
texas
who
are
locally
elected,
as
is
often
the
case
across
this
nation,
it
had
always
been
thought
had
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
judgment
of
their
own
state
legislature
insofar
as
a
societal
judgment
in
that
particular
society
in
texas
as
opposed
to
any
other
state
as
to
which
crimes
were
more
serious
than
other
crimes,
as
to
which
crimes
should
be
punished
more
severely
than
other
crimes,
as
to
whether
certain
offenses
which
were
also
offenses
in
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
should
be
punished
more
or
less
severely
in
texas
in
light
of
unique
texas
experience,
and
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
insofar
as
habitual
offenders
are
concerned,
those
who
are
unable
to
conform
their
conduct
to
the
norms
of
civilized
society,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
phrased
it
a
moment
ago,
the
manner
in
which
those
persons
should
be
punished
and
as
to
what
attempts
at
rehabilitation
should
be
made
for
those
persons.
we
thought
that
the
district
attorney
should
rely
upon
the
judgment
of
the
legislature,
that
he
would
in
exercising
his
discretion
when
he
felt
the
statute
should
be
invoked,
that
he
might
do
so,
subject
to
the
review
of
the
grand
jury
in
texas,
and
that
such
a
sentence
might
be
imposed
on
someone.
now,
seen
in
this
light,
the
application
of
the
statute
is
not
automatic,
as
mr.
rummel
says
it
is.
instead,
the
legislature
gives
the
local
prosecutor
the
discretion
whether
or
not
to
apply
or
to
seek
the
invocation
of
that
statute
on
a
particular
offender.
he
commonly
and
frequently
for
many
reasons
elects
not
to
apply
it
even
thought
he
might.
this
is
well
known.
and
in
such
a
case,
even
then
he
must
persuade
the
grand
jury
that
this
is
a
proper
case
for
the
application
of
the
habitual
offender
statute.
now
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
coker
case,
the
key
difference
between
the
coker
case
and
this
one
is
the
irrevocable
nature
of
the
punishment.
the
key
difference
is
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
concept
of
rehabilitation
that
is
possible.
we
have
an
idea
of
rehabilitation
that
cannot
enter
into
the
equation
in
coker.
there
is
no
rehabilitation
possible
at
all.
we
feel
that
makes
a
very
large
difference.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
of
course,
that
is
the
most
difficult
question
i
think
that
can
be
asked
and
i
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
the
concept
of
proportionality
even
in
death
penalty
cases,
although
it
has
never
been
applied
in
a
case,
in
a
criminal
case
to
invalidate
a
sentence
solely
because
of
its
length,
i
can
envision
in
my
mind
a
state
legislature
so
recklessly
bent
on
some
course
of
misconduct
and
so
totally
unaware
of
principles
established
in
modern
day
civilized
society
that
it
might
enact
some
statute
so
utterly
devoid
of
any
rational
justification
that
the
sentence
upon
that
statute
could
be
excessive
solely
for
length
alone
and
proportionality
for
that
reason
applied.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
i
think
not
or
certainly
it
would
bother
me
to
think
about
that
because
once
again
of
the
irrevocable
nature.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
the
problem
is
what
happens
with
the
other
10
percent.
now
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
all
right.
now,
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
being
10
percent,
it
is
a
much
lower
percentage.
now,
what
we
have
shown
in
the
brief
and
what
the
charts
show
is
from
the
average
length
that
a
person
in
his
situation
will
serve,
being
approximately
12
years,
and
furthermore
we
have
shown
in
another
chart
that
of
those
eligible
for
parole
by
the
third
year
of
eligibility
the
figure
approaches
100
percent
of
those
who
were
eligible
for
parole.
by
reference
to
other
charts,
it
may
be
seen
that
of
that
tiny
percentage
that
is
left,
which
may
possibly
be
as
high
as
one
or
two
percent,
i
believe,
that
those
persons
are
not
persons
such
as
mr.
rummel,
convicted
of
less
serious
offenses
than
robbers,
murderers
and
others
who
become
eligible
for
parole
in
certain
circumstances
in
texas,
and
that
that
percentage
must
be
reserved
for
those
persons
so
depraved
that
parole
is
not
considered
proper.
the
statistics
are
so
overwhelming
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
our
proof
is
so
convincing,
the
mathematical
proof,
that
it
would
be
ignoring
a
very
obvious
reality
to
say
that
mr.
rummel
indeed,
although
he
has
no
legal
expectation
and
no
legal
right,
that
the
odds
are
so
overwhelming
in
his
case
that
it
is
virtually
impossible.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
the
sentence
that
we
have
given
is
life,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
the
texas
approach
to
this
problem
has
been
very
different
from
that
of
some
other
states
and
we
thought
that
we
were
taking
a
more
modern
approach.
now,
we
could
have
a
system
of
highly
determined
sentencing
in
texas,
as
some
states
do
in
some
circumstances.
in
other
words,
we
could
have
a
system
where
a
man
sentenced
to
ten
years
would
serve
ten
years
or
perhaps
nine
years
with
good
behavior.
we
haven't
chosen
to
do
that
system
in
texas,
particularly
with
one
like
mr.
rummel.
the
system
that
texas
has
chosen
to
act
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
what
is
bad
about
him
is
that
he
is
a
habitual
offender,
none
of
his
offenses
singly
have
been
so
serious,
but
a
look
at
his
criminal
record,
as
the
prosecutor
saw
it,
saw
virtually
that
he
is
a
career
criminal,
that
he
committed
one
crime
after
the
other,
that
there
was
a
succession
of
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
total
of
four.
it
is
a
significantly
higher
number
than
four.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
we
are
giving
him
time
because
of
what
he
has
shown
himself
to
be.
he
has
shown
himself
to
be
unable
to
exist
outside
of
prison
for
any
significant
period
of
time
without
violating
the
law.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
it
must
be
said
that
the
state
of
texas
is
faced
with
a
very
difficult
problem
here.
i
wish
we
knew
what
to
do
with
mr.
rummel.
i
wish
the
state
of
texas
--
i
wish
that
a
justice
of
this
court
or
a
penologist
or
sociologist
or
someone
knew
what
to
do
with
someone
like
mr.
rummel
who
is
a
petty
criminal
--
we
admit
it
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
which
texas
does,
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
to
an
extent
which
texas
does.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
as
far
as
the
rehabilitation
and
the
programs
of
the
texas
department
of
corrections
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--
from
my
own
knowledge,
they
are
at
least
as
good
as
those
elsewhere,
we
think
they
are.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
case
in
houston,
the
rouise
case,
which
is
litigating
that
very
matter.
it
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
rummel
--
we
have
tried
short
of
prison
term
with
mr.
rummel
--
he
is
now
serving
his
fourth
term
in
the
penitentiary.
his
first
sentence,
as
the
record
reflects,
were
for
three
years.
he
was
paroled
on
that
sentence,
his
parole
was
revoked
and
he
was
sent
back
for
a
second
time.
his
sentence
on
his
'69
prior
conviction
was
four
years.
he
did
a
portion
of
that
time,
he
was
released.
he
violated
the
law
again
promptly
and
is
now
in
for
his
fourth
time.
now,
we
have
tried
terms
of
imprisonment
for
two
and
three
and
four
years
several
times.
it
hasn't
worked.
the
scheme
that
texas
has
chosen
to
enact
now
is
one
that
we
think
is
not
particularly
oppressive.
what
we
have
said
to
him
is,
mr.
rummel,
all
right,
we
have
in
shorter
terms
of
imprisonment
have
utterly
failed
to
convince
you
that
following
the
law
is
the
wiser
course.
we
have
tried
three
times,
we
have
failed
three
times.
now
you
are
threatened
with
something
that
must
give
you
pause
to
reflect.
now
you
are
threatened
with
the
possibility
that
you
will
never
be
released
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life.
now,
you
know
as
well
as
we
know
that
virtually
no
one
is
kept
in
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life,
but
think
about
that
possibility,
think
about
it
happening,
and
then
when
you
are
paroled
in
approximately
ten
to
twelve
years
from
now,
then
perhaps
that
thought
of
losing
the
rest
of
your
life
in
prison
will
cause
your
conduct
to
change
in
a
manner
that
shorter
terms
of
imprisonment
have
failed
to
do.
now,
perhaps
that
is
not
the
wisest
course
of
conduct
for
mr.
rummel.
perhaps
there
is
a
wiser
course.
perhaps
there
is
some
course
that
would
cause
him
to
be
a
model
citizen
without
the
agony
to
him
of
ten
to
twelve
years
of
imprisonment,
without
the
expense
to
the
state
of
texas,
without
all
the
things
that
are
bade
about
the
whole
situation.
but
the
state
of
texas
doesn't
know
it
is.
and
even
if
there
is
such
a
wiser
course,
the
petitioner's
position
here
is
not
that
what
the
state
of
texas
has
done
is
unwise,
but
that
it
is
forbidden
under
the
constitution,
that
it
is
so
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
i
should
emphasize
very
briefly
that
with
respect
to
the
parole,
in
addition
to
the
twelve-year
average
for
all
persons
doing
life,
a
good
number
actually
are
paroled
at
the
absolute
minimum
which
is
ten.
i
talked
to
the
texas
department
of
corrections
on
friday
and
learned
that
on
december
12th
of
this
year
mr.
rummel
had
already
maintained
trustee
status
which
meant
that
he
was
getting
two
for
one
time
credit
upon
his
sentence.
as
the
court
knows,
in
texas
twenty
years
of
credit
is
necessary
for
parole,
you
can
get
up
to
--
you
can
serve
that
in
half
the
time
or
ten
calendar
years
to
be
eligible
for
parole.
he
had
already
made
trustee.
but
on
december
12th
his
trustee
status
was
made
retroactive
to
the
very
day
he
entered,
meaning
that
he
will
be
considered
for
parole
after
nine
and
one-half
years
of
time
behind
bars
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
and
it
may
all
be
revoked
tomorrow,
yes.
the
system
in
texas
is
one
that
has
a
free
giving
and
taking
of
the
good
time.
that
is
the
system.
now,
after
he
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
now,
after
he
is
paroled
also,
petitioner
rummel
characterizes
his
situation
as
that
of
a
perpetual
prisoner.
once
again,
viewing
the
case
in
reality,
he
is
no
such
thing.
what
we
have
shown
from
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
and
from
the
statistics
in
our
charts
is
that
after
three
years
of
proper
conduct
upon
parole,
he
is
placed
on
annual
reporting
status
in
which
he
need
only
mail
in
once
a
year
a
statement
which
gives
his
location
and
his
job
and
--
his
residence
and
his
job
essentially,
and
then
after
three
years
of
successful
service
upon
that
annual
reporting
status,
he
is
shifted
to
non-reporting
status,
which
means
that
the
only
requirement
upon
him
is
that
he
must
not
violate
the
law.
no
longer
must
he
ask
permission
to
marry,
to
change
county
residence
or
anything
of
the
sort,
or
even
to
stay
in
texas.
he
simply
vows
that
he
will
hot
violate
the
law
and
that
if
he
does
he
can
be
sent
back
to
prison
again,
once
again
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life,
but
he
is
eligible
for
parole
in
that
situation
from
the
first
day
that
he
returns
to
prison.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
it
can.
it
can
be
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
it
can
be
for
any
violation
of
the
law,
no
matter
how
trivial.
once
again,
the
revocation
is
not
automatic,
it
is
discretionary,
and
if
he
is
sent
back
then
he
is
eligible
for
parole
immediately.
the
system
that
texas
has
adopted
is
one
that
when
we
adopted
it
we
had
thought
was
for
the
protection
of
the
individual
offender
in
the
sense
that
he
gained
the
benefits
of
what
we
had
thought
was
the
modern
train
of
thought
that
the
punishment
should
fit
the
offender.
we
don't
want
to
give
every
bank
robber
25
years
or
50
years
or
any
particular
sentence
because
bank
robbers
differ
in
their
experience
and
in
their
motives
and
in
their
circumstances.
mr.
rummel,
too,
has
been
thrown
into
a
very
large
pot
with
a
very
disparate
number
and
types
of
persons
in
it,
those
doing
life
sentences.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
and
in
the
supplement
to
our
brief
that
his
reasonable
expectations
of
treatment
are
far
different
from
those
of
more
serious
offenders
who
have
received
life
sentences.
we
would
also
point
out
that
his
situation
is
very
different
in
serving
a
life
sentence
than
that
of
a
person
in
many
other
states
serving
life
sentences
or
even
long
ones.
we
have
shown
that
because
of
the
overwhelming
statistical
proof
as
to
how
long
he
will
actually
serve
that
his
sentence
is
not
significantly
longer
than
that
he
might
have
received
in
a
number
of
other
jurisdictions.
the
differences
at
least
are
not
so
great
in
our
view
that
it
can
reasonably
be
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbids
it.
again,
texas
believes
that
no
matter
what
criticisms
can
be
made
of
our
scheme,
that
it
is
not
the
proper
function
of
the
federal
courts
to
be
in
the
sentencing
review
business.
the
result
contended
for
by
the
petitioner
would
accomplish
exactly
that
result.
every
prisoner
in
state
prison
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
in
our
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
in
our
particular
case,
we
don't
feel
that
that
would
come
up
because
the
status
as
an
habitual
offender
we
think
is
a
different
one.
but
i
think
in
answer
to
your
earlier
question,
i
have
stated
i
can
conceive
some
circumstances
where
proportionality
would
be
applied
for
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
absolutely
not.
i
would
not,
because
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
we
should
prevail
upon
the
case
regardless.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
if
--
absolutely
--
if
the
man
had
been
sentenced
for
stealing
$230
worth
of
merchandise
on
three
different
occasions,
viewed
in
that
way,
that
would
be
one
case.
that
might
even
be
close
to
the
one
that
you
have
been
talking
about,
but
that
is
not
what
he
was
sentenced
for.
he
was
sentenced
because
under
texas
law
he
is
an
habitual
offender.
that's
different
and
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
we
think
that
long
sentences,
even
very
long
sentences,
if
it
is
the
expressed
societal
judgment
of
the
state
for
various
crimes,
that
that
is
entitled
to
the
deference
in
federal
court,
and
if
might
be
that
a
sentence
could
be
so
unusual
and
so
bizarre
and
so
unsupported
by
logic
that
it
could
be
possible
that
that
would
fall
within
the
punishment
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
or
the
meaning
of
that
word,
but
ordinarily
that
it
would
not,
and
clearly
this
is
such
a
case
where
it
does
not.
it
is
a
case
--
we
feel
that
it
is
quite
easy,
as
judge
thornberry
said
in
the
court
below,
and
quite
openly
i
believe,
that
perhaps
if
he
were
the
prosecutor
he
wouldn't
have
sought
to
obtain
this
indictment,
if
he
were
a
grand
juror
he
wouldn't
have
approved
it,
if
he
were
a
state
legislator
he
would
vote
to
repeal
it,
but
he
holds
none
of
those
offices.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
i
do
agree
with
that
test,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
purpose
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute
--
now,
actually
the
--
you
know,
the
petitioner
makes
the
point
that
you
can
always
make
a
rational
basis
explanation
for
any
punishment,
even
death
for
a
minor
offense
as
a
rational
basis
in
the
sense
that
it
will
prevent
recurrence
of
that
offense
again.
but
we
think
it
must
have
a
rational
basis
supported
by
civilized
thought
that
is
thinkable
in
our
system
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
look
at
what
the
legislature
has
done
and
the
apparent
purposes
for
which
they
have
done
it.
i
attempt
to
view
the
reality
of
a
situation.
now,
if
the
state
of
texas
says
--
has
chosen
to
make
these
offenses
felonies,
there
is
a
strong
presumption
upon
the
validity
of
that
judgment,
that
presumption
in
connection
with
the
realities
of
the
punishment
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
it
is
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
label
felony
is
determinative,
no.
i
think
that
what
he
has
done
is
determinative,
according
to
how
that
state
has
chosen,
the
consequences
it
has
chosen
to
affix
to
what
he
has
done.
and
i
think
it
is
patently
obvious
that
a
man
that
has
a
criminal
record
as
mr.
rummel
has
cannot
be
seriously
contended
that
he
is
outside
the
constitutional
ambit
of
what
is
permissible.
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
even
texas
may
be
more
severe
than
other
jurisdictions,
there
is
no
constitutional
principle
that
i
know
of
that
federal
courts
should
go
around
and
look
to
the
most
severe
statute
in
every
jurisdiction
has
one
--
he
mentioned
theft
of
goats
in
texas
--
we
used
to
have
a
theft
of
edible
meat
statute
back
from
the
depression
days
with
the
ranchers,
it
was
tied
in,
in
other
words,
to
a
particular
social
situation
in
texas,
it
was
a
very
serious
offense.
and
i
think
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
make
those
kinds
of
things
offenses,
and
i
didn't
know
--
and
i
am
not
aware
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
constitution
says
--
we
look
for
the
strongest
statutes
that
there
are,
the
most
severe
criminal
ones,
and
we
throw
them
all
out
because
they
are
the
most
severe.
i
think
that
is
the
fallacy
his
argument.
he
may
show
that
we
are
more
severe
in
the
punishment
we
inflict,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
basis
for
throwing
out
the
punishment.
it
must
be
so
much
more
severe,
so
much
more
severe
that
it
appears
to
be
without
a
sufficient
rational
basis
that
it
shocks
the
conscience,
if
you
will,
language
that
has
been
frequently
thrown
around
or
expressed
i
should
say
in
this
context
before,
and
that
that
is
true
here.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that
is
correct.
it
is
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
not
from
the
legislature.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
from
their
own
consciences
is
their
guidance.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
there
are
no
formal
guidelines.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
any
statistics
on
how
often
they
agree
with
the
prosecutor.
i
suggest
that
it
is
most
of
the
time.
i
suggest
that
in
smaller
communities
perhaps
they
may
be
more
independent
than
in
larger
ones,
perhaps
the
reverse
is
the
case.
i
don't
really
know.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
totally
correct
to
say
that
the
prosecutor's
discretion
is
unfettered.
we
have
existing
protections
for
prosecutors
who
are
seeking
indictments,
whether
habitual
or
any
other
kind,
for
impermissible
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
that
is
ultimately
but
even
judicially
he
cannot
make
a
decision
of
that
sort
on
an
impermissible
basis,
a
racial
basis
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
under
the
statute
--
i
am
talking
about
existing
case
law,
prior
case
law
of
this
court,
your
honor,
and
texas
courts,
not
under
the
statute.
i
am
talking
about
invidious
or
some
other
sort
of
discrimination.
i
am
talking
about
a
prosecutor
who
is
persecuting
a
particular
individual
with
the
habitual
offender
statute
and
not
in
the
sound
exercise
of
his
judgment.
there
are
case
law
authority
given
in
those
kinds
of
protections.
there
is
at
the
moment
no
other
formal
kind
of
protection
that
he
has,
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
and
the
grand-jury
the
same,
yes.
that's
right.
now,
of
course,
we
say
that
remedial
measures
are
peculiarly
province
of
the
legislature.
now,
in
the
spencer
case
in
1967,
when
it
was
before
this
court,
as
the
court
knows,
by
the
time
that
the
case
got
to
this
court
the
texas
legislature
had
already
enacted
a
statute
that
had
done
away
with
the
single
proceeding
that
was
a
problem
in
the
case
and
had
instituted
the
bifurcated
proceeding
where
the
jury
would
not
be
told
until
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial
about
any
prior
convictions
that
the
defendant
had,
so
remedial
legislation
had
taken
place.
i
am
aware
of
remedial
legislation
in
this
case,
but
it
is
not
relevant,
of
course,
to
the
outcome
here.
it
may
exist.
it
is
being
undertaken
by
those
persons
that
we
feel
are
the
proper
ones
to
diagnose
the
problem
and
if
there
are
some
results
that
are
impermissible
or
even
if
the
results
are
generally
all
right
but,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested,
that
better
guidelines
should
be
instituted.
perhaps
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
should
review
sentence
length,
as
some
courts
do
in
some
systems.
there
are
a
lot
of
systems
that
perhaps
might
be
better
and
we
don't
debate
and
don't
feel
that
it
is
our
burden
to
show
that
ours
is
the
wisest
system
among
all
the
states,
but
only
that
is
permissible
under
the
constitution
and
that
this
court
is
not
the
proper
forum
for
correcting
every
apparent
inequity
in
the
sentencing
process.
now,
there
is
one
other
--
the
court
knows
that
there
is
an
alternate
prayer
for
relief
at
the
conclusion
of
our
brief,
and
just
before
i
close
i
would
like
to
emphasize
it,
and
that
is
that
if
the
court
is
not
convinced
that
there
is
a
facial
inequity
in
this
case,
if
it
appears
under
the
court's
view
that
the
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate
for
what
has
been
shown
--
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
never
has
been
a
hearing
in
this
case
in
either
state
or
federal
court.
now,
judge
borman,
dissenting
in
hart
v.
coiner,
the
famous
fourth
circuit
case
that
preceded
this
one,
stated
that
it
should
not
be
beyond
the
ordinary
knowledge
of
judges
who
had
been
prosecutors
and
other
kinds
of
attorneys
before
they
were
judges
that
the
habitual
offender
statute
is
rarely
enacted
for
a
person
who
only
has
the
offenses
that
is
necessary
to
formally
allege
and
prove.
now,
if
there
is
any
doubt
at
all
about
the
existence
of
that
fact
in
this
case,
we
pray
for
a
remand
to
the
district
court
where
we
are
entitled
we
believe
to
show
the
full
extent
of
mr.
rummel's
criminal
history.
we
cannot
believe
that
if
it
were
shown
that
he
had
committed
sufficient
offenses
to
show
to
the
agreement
of
everyone
that
he
is
a
career
criminal
in
an
ordinary
understanding
of
that
word,
that
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
embark
upon
a
course
of
conduct
that
we
have
undertaken.
there
was
in
this
case
no
objection
at
his
trial
to
the
punishment
against
him.
if
there
had
been,
the
record
might
well
be
different.
if
mr.
rummel's
attorney
had
stood
up
and
said
we
think
life
for
these
crimes
is
too
much,
the
prosecutor
might
well
at
that
point
have
stood
up
and
said,
very
well,
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
hear
the
rest
of
it,
we
will
be
glad
to
proceed.
we
didn't
have
that
opportunity.
in
the
federal
district
court
below,
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
along
with
our
answer.
under
the
case
law
that
is
all
we
needed
to
do,
we
felt.
ultimately
we
were
proved
correct.
in
essence,
we
think
it
is
quite
similar
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
if
the
case
is
going
to
go
off
on
proportionality
to
the
benefit
of
mr.
rummel,
the
state
would
pray
that
it
go
off
upon
the
fall
basis
that
we
have
a
full
opportunity
to
show
exactly
his
history
and
his
circumstances.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
there
is
no
requirement
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
quite
so,
but
there
is
still
nothing
in
texas
law
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
other
offenses
and
his
other
criminal
record.
the
texas
law
precludes
the
use
of
those
other
convictions
not
pleaded
in
the
indictment
for
the
procedural
sequence
which
results
in
enhancement,
but
they
can
still
be
introduced.
and
i
suppose
that
there
are
cases
that
where
a
defendant
might
take
the
stand
and
in
effect
might
urge,
in
spite
of
the
prior
convictions,
that
the
jury
or
the
judge,
the
sentencing
authority
effect
a
nullification,
as
it
is
called,
that
is
refuse
to
find
that
the
prior
felonies
are
true
in
order
to
avoid
a
life
sentence.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
it
was
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
it
was
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
all
i
argue
here
is
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
presume
or
that
there
may
well
have
been
other
circumstances
that
were
never
shown.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
asking
that
the
court
presume
that
he
has
committed
offenses.
i
am
asking
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
am
asking
that
the
court,
as
judge
borman
did
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
his
dissent,
note
from
their
experience
that
it
is
possible
that
there
were
other
things
known
to
the
prosecutor,
that
because
a
statute
says
a
and
b
are
all
that
is
required,
that
there
may
be
other
things
and
that
we
would
be
able
to
show
the
other
things.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
presumption.
we
are
asking
to
be
able
to
meet
our
burden
of
proof.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
believe
so.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
the
matter
is
unclear
as
to
what
would
happen
on
remand,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
texas
courts.
i
don't
know
if
there
would
be
any
case
on
the
point
that
would
explain
it.
you
see,
in
the
meantime
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
that's
right.
that's
true.
