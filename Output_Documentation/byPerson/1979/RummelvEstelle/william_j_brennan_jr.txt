justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
went
on
to
say,
as
i
remember
it,
that
as
long
as
there
is
a
rational
for
the
sentencing
scheme,
that
passes
the
eight
amendment
standard.
do
you
agree
with
that
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
measure
civilized
thought?
he
says
you
look
at
what
49
other
states
do
and
you
say
you
don't
have
to
do
that,
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
are
looking
at
the
real
world,
general
becker,
would
it
really
matter
if
they
said
each
of
these
are
a
misdemeanor
but
nevertheless
we
shall
apply
our
habitual
offender
statute
to
three
misdemeanor
convictions
of
this
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
state
shouldn't
be
ordered
just
to
resentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
that
weren't
true.
assume
that
all
he
was
entitled
to
was
resentencing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
should
we
say
--
should
we
just
say
resentence,
this
is
too
much?
should
we
say
how
much
should
--
should
we
give
them
any
guidance
as
to
how
much
enhancement,
if
any,
is
permissible,
or
do
you
think
any
enhancement
is
permissible
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
a
three-timer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
kind
of
a
standard
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggest
some
kinds
of
nonviolent
crimes
would
be
quite
all
right,
and
yet
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
enact?
