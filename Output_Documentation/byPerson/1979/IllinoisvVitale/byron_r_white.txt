justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
be
going
the
other
way,
they
would
just
be
reaching
the
same
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
right
but
they
would
be
going
on
state
grounds
whereas
now
they
have
decided
it
on
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
if
we
disagreed
with
them,
we
would
have
told
them
that
they
were
wrong
on
the
federal
ground
and
leave
it
to
them
to
decide
it
on
state
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
this
one?(laughter)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
we
to
understand
the
remand
and
the
answer
that
the
court
gave?
did
they
say
they
decided
the
case
solely
on
double
jeopardy
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
did
the
state
say
in
answer
to
our
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
we
supposed
to
go
behind
that
or
not?
the
said
solely
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
clearly
given,
given
identity
of
offenses
which
they
found,
then
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
there
is
double
jeopardy.
that
is
solely
constitutional
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
mr.
justice
dooley,
now
deceased,
the
former
jim
dooley,
the
noted
personal
injury
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
mr.
vitale
is
mighty
lucky
a
young
man
to
have
been
charged
with
a
traffic
offense
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
when
he
ran
down
and
killed
two
young
children
in
a
guarded
school
patrol
crossing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
at
least
say
you
must
abandon
the
offense
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
even
if
the
offenses
are
different,
and
even
if
to
prove
the
one
you
don't
need
to
prove
something
that
is
involved
in
the
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do,
but
that
has
not
been
the
rule
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
want
to
know,
aside
from
your
compulsory
joinder
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dirksen,
can
i
ask
you,
under
the
failing
to
reduce
speed
statute
in
illinois,
i
notice
your
client
was
only
fined
$15.
what
was
the
maximum
penalty
under
that
statute?
