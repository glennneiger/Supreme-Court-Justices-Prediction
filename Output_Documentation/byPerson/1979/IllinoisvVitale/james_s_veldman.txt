mr.
james
s.
veldman
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
good
morning.
my
name
is
james
s.
veldman,
and
i
represent
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois.
we
are
your
petitioner
here.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
applicability
or
i
might
say
our
position
being
the
complete
lack
of
applicability
to
the
facts
in
this
case
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
on
november
20,
1974,
john
vitale
struck
with
his
automobile
and
killed
two
young
children.
on
december
23,
1974,
he
was
found
guilty
on
a
traffic
ticket
which
was
issued
at
the
scene
of
the
collision,
charging
him
with
failure
to
reduce
speed
to
avoid
an
accident.
on
the
following
day
december
24,
1974,
vitale
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
because
he
was
a
minor
at
the
time
those
charges
took
the
form
of
a
petition
for
adjudication
of
wardship.
the
judge
in
the
juvenile
court
branch
of
the
unified
circuit
court
of
cook
county
finally
dismissed
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charges
out
among
other
basis,
on
the
basis
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
people
have
appealed
up
through
the
state
court
system
and
now
come
before
your
honors.
as
your
honors
undoubtedly
know,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
certified
that
its
decision
was
based
squarely
upon
its
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
clause.
as
you
also
know,
i
am
sure,
there
was
a
very
strong
dissent
in
this
case
and
i
rely
on
a
great
deal
of
the
logic
and
thinking
of
that
dissent
in
my
argument
here.
it
is
our
position
that
these
offenses
are
not
the
same
offenses
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
in
that,
one,
they
are
not
the
same
offense
as
defined
under
double
jeopardy
purposes
and,
secondly,
that
the
traffic
offense
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
it
is
absolutely
clear,
your
honors,
that
a
person
may
not
be
twice
placed
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
what
the
clause
protects
is
it
prevents
multiple
prosecutions
and/or
punishments
for
the
same
offense.
and
those
are
the
critical
words,
as
this
court
well
knows,
the
same
offense.
the
identity
of
the
offense
and
not
the
act
or
series
of
acts
involved
is
the
crucial
question
presented
in
a
double
jeopardy
case.
blockburger
v.
united
states,
ciucci
v.
illinois.
where
one
act
or
a
series
of
acts
in
a
violation
of
more
than
one
statutory
provision
and
where
those
violations
are
not
the
same
offense
as
defined
under
blockburger,
that
there
is
no
prohibition
about
twice
trying,
convicting
or
punishing
the
defendant
upon
those
charges,
blockburger
as
i
have
indicated,
and
gavieres
v.
united
states.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
might
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
you
do
have
a
choice,
and
i
suggest
to
you
this.
in
brown
v.
ohio,
as
i
attempted
to
note
in
my
second
point
in
my
reply
brief,
in
brown
v.
ohio
the
question
of
whether
the
offense
was
a
lesser
included
offense
came
before
this
court
more
or
less
as
a
fait
accompli.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
precisely.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
but
i
believe
that
the
difference
here
is
that
it
was
not
contested.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
if
that
were
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
believe
that
you
can,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
this
court
must
look
at
mr.
justice
dooley's
holding
and
i
believe
that
you
must
consider
it
in
light
of,
number
one,
the
dissent,
which
i
don't
think
of
as
subversive
in
this
particular
case
at
any
rate,
and
also
in
light
of
the
very
clear
definition
of
what
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
don't
think
this
court
must
find
itself
bound
by
a
holding
of
a
state
court
which
would,
of
course,
in
effect
--
if
your
honors
feel
bound
by
mr.
justice
dooley's
determination,
then
you
must
apply
brown
v.
ohio,
and
for
this
court
to
be
put
in
that
position
where
it
has
no
choice
but
to
follow
mr.
justice
dooley
i
submit
is
cutting
unnecessarily
down
on
what
are
obviously
the
powers
of
this
court.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
unless
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
would
say
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
would
say
in
the
ordinary
case,
no,
unless
the
construction
put
upon
the
--
of
whether
it
is
black
or
white
so
encroaches
upon
that
constitutional
question
that
it
deprives
this
court
of
the
right
to
decide
the
constitutional
question,
and
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
had
said
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
but
do
you
not
feel,
your
honor,
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
were
to
hold
that
a
statute
which
said
there
shall
be
a
hearing
and
the
supreme
court
were
to
say
that
statute
means
there
is
to
be
no
hearing,
do
you
not
feel
that
this
court
would
be
empowered
to
overturn
that
undue
process
grounds,
notwithstanding
the
state
court
decision?
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
am.
i
am
in
a
very
true
sense
because
i
feel
that,
as
i
have
attempted
to
do
under
the
second
point
of
the
people's
principal
brief
here,
there
is
a
very
definite
and
standard
definition
of
what
is
a
lesser
included
offense
and
this
offense
simply
does
not
fit
into
that
definition.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
i
think
that
is
his
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
think
that
the
problem
that
i
see
in
that
is,
number
one,
that
you
will
notice,
your
honor,
that
the
case
law
which
i
cited
to
this
court
is
very
clear,
that
--
i
am
not
attempting
to
depart
from
your
question
but
perhaps
approaching
it
a
little
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
answer
a
question
by
one
of
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
dooley,
at
page
a7
of
his
opinion
as
it
appears
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
seems
to
be
defining
lesser
included
offense
under
the
concept
of
double
jeopardy,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
one
of
his
errors
is
that
he
misdefines
it.
he
speaks
in
terms
of
what
the
fact
of
the
lesser
offense
must
usually
contain
and
no
element
not
found
in
the
greater.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
from
the
cases
such
as
brown
v.
ohio,
such
as,
for
example,
virgin
islands
v.
acquino
in
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
that
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
the
lesser
included
offense
situation
is
thusly
defined.
the
greater
offense
will
always
and
of
necessity
include
all
of
the
elements
of
the
lesser.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
he
says
--
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me
for
just
a
moment.
on
page
a7,
three
lines
from
the
bottom,
a
new
paragraph
begins.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
"...
the
lesser
offense,
failing
to
reduce..."
--
but,
you
see,
he
says,
your
honor,
it
is
usually
the
situation,
and
i
think,
unless
i
misinterpret
his
language,
i
believe
that
that
indicates
that
he
has
misapprehended
the
rule,
the
rule
of
the
definition
there.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
which,
of
course,
i
submit
to
this
court
is
totally
not
true.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes,
the
so-called
lesser
included
offense
involves
no
element
of
death,
it
doesn't
even
necessarily
involve
an
element
of
collision
with
any
person.
the
so-called
greater
offense,
on
the
other
hand,
can
be
easily
proven
in
a
number
of
instances
without
proving
the
lesser,
since
voluntary
manslaughter,
as
your
honors
can
see
defined
statutorily,
and
i
have
set
it
out
at
page
16
of
our
principal
brief,
clearly
you
can
commit
involuntary
manslaughter
in
illinois
easily
without
the
use
of
an
automobile
and
therefore
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
it
is
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
it
is
the
offense
which
is
known
in
illinois
as
reckless
homicide.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
it
is
characterized
in
the
statute,
if
you
will
notice,
as
an
included
offense.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
would
i
say
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
perhaps
if
we
had
the
reckless
driving
of
the
vehicle,
you
might
have
an
instance
where
it
might
be
an
included
offense,
but
what
i
think
you
cannot
--
even
in
your
honor's
pyramid
of
setting
up
sub-categories,
you
cannot
make
failing
to
reduce
speed
a
lesser
included
offense
even
a
reckless
homicide
because
all
that
you
are
talking
about
in
failure
to
reduce
speed
is
a
simple
violation
of
due
care
by
not
reducing
speed
even
to
avoid,
say,
an
empty
wagon
which
on
the
highway.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
i
think
a
great
many
things,
as
your
honor
can
see
at
page
17
in
the
people's
principal
brief,
there
are
a
great
many
things
which
are
included
within
this
particular
section
of
the
illinois
vehicle
code.
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
separate
and
distinct
offenses
which
might
be
committed
under
this
section.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
don't
think
that
is
clear
as
the
case
in
the
posture
in
which
this
case
comes
before
this
court.
there
was
a
police
report
which
indicated
that
vitale
had
violate
a
number
of
illinois
traffic
laws.
we
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
at
this
juncture,
as
the
case
presently
comes
before
the
court,
that
we
can
say
--
and
i
certainly
personally
cannot
say
--
whether
the
proof
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter
would
have
involved
the
failure
to
reduce
speed
necessarily
or
not.
i
think
that
had
the
case
not
been
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
oh,
it
would
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
but
do
you
notice,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
--
the
statute
begins
--
we
are
talking
about
traffic
statute
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
statute
begins,
"no
vehicle
may
be
driven
upon
a
highway
of
this
state
at
a
speed
which
is
greater
than
reasonable,"
et
cetera,
and
it
goes
on
and
it
makes
a
number
of
what
i
would
consider
to
be
possibly
separate
and
distinct
traffic
offenses,
one
of
which
is
failure
to
reduce
speed.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
and
i
think
mr.
justice
underwood
commented
in
his
dissenting
opinion
on
this
very
subject,
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
which
of
the
number
of
possible
violations
committed
under
this
or
other
sections
might
have
been
the
basic
proof
in
the
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
actually,
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
the
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
way
the
case
came,
if
your
honor
will
note
appendix
b
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
way
that
the
cause
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
for
the
first
district
had
decided
that
they
had
not
said
much
or
anything
about
the
double
jeopardy
question
involved
in
the
case.
they
had
simply
based
it
on
an
illinois
statute.
mr.
justice
dooley
and
the
majority
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
their
opinion
said
we
find
an
even
more
compelling
rationale
in
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
this
forum,
the
forum
before
this
honorable
court
is
really
the
first
time
in
which
a
full-fledged
argument
on
the
double
jeopardy
aspects
of
this
case
has
been
made,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
and
i
believe
the
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
think
i
follow
your
honor's
question.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
you
do
not,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
we
did
not
because
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
basically
the
people's
brief
which
is
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
which
i
might
point
i
did
not
either
write
or
argue
--
dealt
basically
with
the
state
law
question
which
came
up
from
the
appellate
court.
we
have
the
procedure
in
illinois
of
leave
to
appeal,
and
one's
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
is
normally
limited
to
those
questions
in
the
appellate
court
which
are
considered
error
by
the
petitioner.
so
we
were
somewhat
limited
in
what
we
could
argue
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
and
the
briefs
for
respondent
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
really
did
not
bring
out
the
double
jeopardy
question
which
under
illinois
court
procedure,
again,
limited
the
people
in
that
we
were
compelled
basically
to
keep
our
answer
within
the
bounds
raised
by
the
party
appellee
there.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
so-called
compulsory
joinder
statute
in
illinois.
the
appellate
court
opinion
i
think
can
be
pretty
much
condensed
down
to
the
fact
that
this
prosecution
violated
sections
3-3
and
3-4
of
chapter
38
of
the
illinois
revised
statutes
in
that
all
of
these
offenses
could
have
and
should
have
been
joined
before
a
single
court
for
trial.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
totally
departed
from
that
rationale.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
of
these
two
charges,
an
adjudication
on
the
merits?
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes.
there
has
been
an
adjudication
of
the
merits,
although
we
don't
have
a
transcript
so
we
don't
know
what
took
place.
but
mr.
vitale
has
been
found
guilty
and
he
did
not
plead
guilty.
he
was
found
guilty
in
the
traffic
proceeding
and
was
fined
in
the
sum
of
$15.
and
i
can
only
assume
that
there
was
there
some
sort
of
trial
and
adjudication,
although
we
do
not
have
a
transcript
before
us.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
highest
court
that
has
spoken
on
the
issue,
yes.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
you
do
not
have
a
final
determination
of
that
issue
by
the
highest
reviewing
court.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes,
it
is
unreversed
in
the
sense
that
it
is
untouched.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
no,
but
they
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
they
specifically,
in
answer
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
78-2,
when
this
honorable
court
sent
the
case
back,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
specified
that
its
opinion
was
based
on
the
firth
amendment,
so
they
declined
to
decide
the
issue,
and
i
can
understand
that
because
the
committee
comments
appended
to
section
3-3
and
3-4
--
and
those
committee
comments
in
illinois
are
proper
source
of
legislative
intent
--
indicate
that
what
those
sections
were
basically
meant
to
cover
was
an
instance
involving
multiple
prosecutions
under
a
single
act
or
a
series
of
acts
which
were
not
covered
or
barred
by
the
concept
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
fifth
amendment,
and
it
may
have
very
well
been
that
finding,
as
they
did,
that
the
fifth
amendment
barred
the
prosecution,
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
thought
it
superfluous
to
discuss
the
illinois
statute
under
those
conditions.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
think
that
having
determined
that
in
the
basis
of
its
opinion
was
purely
federal
constitutional
grounds,
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
be
precluded
from
so
doing.
i
should
think
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
i
suppose
that
in
theory
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it,
but
i
think
that
in
actuality
the
proper
remedy
--
and
i
think
that
if
i
were
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
i
would
argue
that
the
proper
remedy,
having
decided
it
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
and
been
then
reversed,
would
be
to
return
the
case
to
the
unified
circuit
court
of
cook
county
for
further
proceedings
under
this
indictment,
and
the
question
there,
i
think
we
would
then
have
perhaps
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
statute
but
i
think
it
would
be
raised
properly
in
the
trial
court.
i
think
it
would
ill-behoove
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
say,
well,
we
decided
our
opinion
was
on
one
rationale
but
since
they
won't
buy
that
we
will
just
go
180
degrees
the
other
way,
and
i
cannot
conceive,
being
somewhat
familiar
with
the
justices
on
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
that
they
would
do
that.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
well,
they
would
be
reaching
the
same
result
but
they
would
be
reaching
the
same
result
on
a
completely
different
rationale.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
but
they
have
said,
your
honor,
in
answer
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes,
if
nothing
else.
and
as
i
have
said,
their
specific
answer
to
the
inquiry
of
this
court
under
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
original
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
was,
the
question
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
have
you
decided
this
case
on
state
grounds,
federal
grounds
or
both,
and
the
answer
was
federal
grounds
alone.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes,
i
suppose
they
could
do
that.
they
could
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes,
we
did.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
and
they
ignored
it.
they
in
fact
ignored
it.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
federal
error
in
the
analysis
of
the
state
statute?
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
think
the
error
which
was
committed
by
that
court
was
first
in
its
interpretation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
secondly
in
finding
that
under
illinois
law
those
offenses
are
the
same
offense.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
but
i
don't
think
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
--
i
see
my
time
is
expired,
but
i
would
like
to
answer
your
honor's
question
if
i
may.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
quite
divorce
the
two
things
in
the
way
that
mr.
justice
dooley
wrote
his
opinion.
he
seems
to
interpret
the
illinois
statutes
but
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
and
i
think
that
one
cannot
divorce
the
two
things.
and
i
think
the
federal
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
for
example,
he
defines
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
he
says
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
because
unless
i
misread
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
dooley
and
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
their
position
was
that
the
offenses
were
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
but
then
the
statute
barred
them.
it
would
have
barred
them
in
illinois
too
had
they
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
yes.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
for
the
blockbuger
test.
mr.
james
s.
veldman
but
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
i
think
that
as
you
not
believe
that
this
court
can
be
bound
by
what
is
a
total
erroneous
interpretation
of
what
is
a
lesser
included
offense
because
if
this
court
is
so
bound
then
in
fact
the
illinois
supreme
court
by
determining
an
illinois
question
would
be
detecting
the
applicapabilty
of
brown
v.
ohio
in
this
court
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
is
that
state
legislator?
mr.
james
s.
veldman
the
state
legislators
can
define
offences
as
lesser
included
offences.
i
would
say
up
to
a
point,
may
i
say
that,
may
i
just
say
this
i
think
one
reaches
a
point
and
please
bear
with
me
i
hope
my
thinking
is
clear
one
reaches
at
point
where
the
lesser
included
offences
doctrine
can
be
so
extended
as
to
violate
for
example
due
process
because
one
could
have
a
conviction
upon
a
charge
never
made
against
the
criminal
defendant
if
in
fact
lesser
included
offences
given
to
broad
and
interpretation.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
an
example
of
that
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
was
attempting
to
respond.
i
realize
my
time
is
run,
your
honor.
do
you
wish
me
to
conclude?
mr.
james
s.
veldman
thank
you.
all
right.
an
example
of
that
might
--
i
am
trying
to
think
very
quickly
of
one
example
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
for
example,
one
could
have
--
one
could
be
convicted
of
murder.
take
an
extreme
example.
suppose
someone
were
charged
with
murder
and
then
were
convicted
of
armed
robbery
on
the
evidence
presented
and
the
legislature
said,
well,
armed
robbery
may
be
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder,
and
this
court
--
now,
that
is
reduxio
absurda,
i
grant
you,
it
would
never
be
that
extreme.
but
in
much
less
extreme
cases
it
might
very
well
be
--
mr.
james
s.
veldman
i
hope
that
this
honorable
court
will
not
so
hold.
unless
the
justices
have
any
further
questions
of
me,
as
i
said,
i
realize
my
time
is
expired.
