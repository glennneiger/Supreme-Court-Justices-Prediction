justice
potter
stewart
my
problem,
mr.
veldman,
in
this
case
is,
as
you
might
have
anticipated
would
be
the
problem
of
one
or
more
members
of
the
court,
is
that
whatever
we
might
independently
think
about
it,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
through
the
opinion
of
the
late
mr.
justice
dooley
has
told
us
that
in
illinois
this
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
and
to
be
sure,
there
was
a
very
vigorous
dissenting
opinion,
but
that
is
the
construction
of
the
law
of
illinois
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
we
have
no
choice
but
what
to
accept
it,
don't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
held
that
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
that
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
that
--
i
used
to
have
a
law
teacher
who
told
the
whole
class
that
dissenting
opinions
were
subversive
literature.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
the
court
has
spoken
through
the
late
mr.
justice
dooley,
that
is
your
court,
the
highest
court
of
your
state,
and
it
has
told
us
that
in
illinois
this
failing
to
stop
or
rather
driving
at
excessive
speed
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
manslaughter.
and
we
can't
independently
reexamine
that
holding,
can
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
would
concede,
would
you
--
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
mr.
veldman,
wouldn't
you,
that
if
a
state
legislature
passes
a
law
saying
that
something
is
black
and
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
says
what
this
really
means
is
that
something
is
white,
we
have
absolutely
no
power
whatsoever
to
disagree
with
the
construction
put
upon
that
law
by
the
highest
court
of
its
state,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
do
we
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
is
this
different?
that
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that
exceptional
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
in
other
words
if
the
statute
as
passed
saying
there
shall
be
no
hearing
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
before
somebody
is
fired
and
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
says,
well,
what
it
really
means
is
that
there
shall
be
a
hearing,
then
can
we
entertain
a
due
process
attack
upon
that
statute
upon
the
ground
that
it
purports
to
provide
for
no
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
constructed
the
statute
to
say
what
it
really
means
is
that
there
will
be
a
hearing
in
accord
with
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
cite
where
on
page
a7
he
says
that
it
is
usually
included?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
says,
"as
is
usually
the
situation
between
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses."
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
says,
in
any
event,
in
this
case
the
lesser
offense
requires
no
proof
beyond
that
which
is
necessary
for
a
conviction
of
the
greater.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
how
can
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
err
on
state
statutory
law
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
potter
stewart
if
as
a
matter
of
state
law
first
degree
murder
includes
manslaughter,
say,
how
is
that
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
he
is
saying
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense
that
is
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
under
brown
v.
ohio
we
know
that
they
are
the
same
offence
for
the
meeting
in
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
the
blockburger
original
test
was
not
a
double
jeopardy
case.
it
was
just
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
--
legislature.
and
so
could
the
legislature
of
any
state,
that's
one
of
the
results
of
briton
against
maryland.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
an
example
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
wondered
what
sort
of
thing
you
had
in
mind,
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
could
reduce
it
to
zero
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
from
five
miles
an
hour
he
could
reduce
it
to
zero
and
then
he
wouldn't
have
had
a
collision.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
view
that
has
been
expressed
by
some
members
of
this
court,
but
never
adopted
by
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
your
case
is
brown
v.
ohio
which
was
a
court
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
were
you,
i
would
suggest
you
stay
right
there.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
good
idea
to
abandon
also,
because
that
is
a
matter
of
your
state
law.
that
has
never
been
held
here
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
double
jeopardy
law.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
other
hand,
brown
v.
ohio
was
decided
by
this
court
under
the
double
jeopardy
provision
as
applied
to
the
states
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
involved
lesser
included
offenses,
and
i
would
think
that
your
argument
would
be
based
squarely
on
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
state
that
on
the
way
home
on
the
airplane.
