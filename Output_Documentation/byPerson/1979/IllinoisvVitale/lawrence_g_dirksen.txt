mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
lawrence
dirksen,
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
john
vitale.
your
honors,
i
believe,
to
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
first
came
out,
i
can
probably
fill
the
court
in
a
little
bit
on
the
history
of
this
case
because
this
is
the
first
time
that
double
jeopardy
really
has
ever
become
an
issue.
this
case
has
been
all
over
and
every
conceivable
argument
that
could
have
been
made
against
john
vitale
by
the
state
of
illinois
has
been
made.
originally,
they
challenged
us
on
jurisdiction.
just
to
take
a
step
backwards
john
vitale
was
tried
on
the
minor
traffic
violation.
his
uncle
represented
him
on
that
matter.
he
was
tried
in
the
suburban
court
not
too
far
outside
of
chicago.
from
the
conversation
i
had
with
his
uncle,
there
was
a
full
trial.
not
only
did
the
witnesses
testify
against
john
vitale,
john
vitale
testified
himself,
which
is
neither
here
nor
there.
but
if
i
had
been
representing
him,
i
certainly
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
take
the
stand,
but
he
did
testify,
so
it
was
a
full
trial.
as
i
see
this
case,
i
have
absolutely
no
argument
--
in
fact,
i
entirely
agree
with
judge
dooley's
opinion.
but
really
what
we
would
be
talking
about
here
would
be
multiple
trials
if
the
state
would
prevail
on
this
final
argument
because
as
i
say,
they
had
gone
from
jurisdiction
originally.
that
didn't
work.
they
said
we
can
do
one
thing
in
the
traffic
court
and
we
can
do
something
else
in
the
juvenile.
well,
john
vitale
is
no
longer
a
juvenile,
but
in
those
days
they
thought
that
they
could
prosecute
him
on
traffic
here
and
perhaps
on
the
manslaughter
over
in
the
juvenile
court.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they
couldn't
do
it
as
an
adult.
i
raised
that
question
in
the
circuit
court,
i
raise
it
in
the
appellate
court,
and
i
asked
the
state
in
front
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
my
original
motion
was
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
adjudication
of
delinquency
and
it
was
based
on
statutory
and/or
constitutional
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
which
had
compulsory
joinder
statutes
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
it
was
a
joint
motion,
yes.
i
won
both
ways.
the
circuit
court
ruled
on
the
compulsory
joinder
statutes
that
the
matter
should
have
been
joined
in
one
trial,
one
proceeding.
the
appellate
court
said
the
same
thing
and
they
further
reiterated
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
yes,
your
honor,
i
represented
him
since
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
i
think
it
was
very
clear,
there
was
never
a
question
that
it
did
not
apply
to
juveniles.
the
state
argued
that
but
the
court
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
a
juvenile
issue
was
entirely
dismissed
because
i
think
we
all
recognize,
and
everybody
did
in
the
courts,
the
nine
judges
from
the
state
of
illinois
thus
far,
that
juveniles
have
all
the
same
rights
as
adults
and
that
is
what
i
was
saying
when
i
back-tracked,
the
state
abandoned
that
argument.
they
said,
okay,
forget
about
the
juvenile
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
didn't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
read
it
the
way
mr.
justice
stevens
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
they
said
that
appellate
court
held
under
the
compulsory
joinder
statute
that
the
state
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
oh,
they
sent
us
back
to
you
and
said
solely
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
well,
mr.
justice
dooley
who
wrote
the
opinion
died.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
they
are
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
absolutely
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
yes,
he
is,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
this
was
the
last
opinion
that
he
wrote.
your
honors,
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
note
that
there
is
not
much
for
me
to
elaborate
on
on
justice
dooley's
opinion.
i
simply
agree
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
certainly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
it
would
not
have
to
be
in
every
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
certainly
you
would,
your
honor.
i
think
maybe
i
should
say
something
about
the
case
because
i
have
know
it
that
long.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
you
see,
here
we
are
not
talking
about
the
amount
of
speed,
we
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
he
failed
to
reduce
it,
the
fact
that
he
failed
to
reduce
speed
resulted
in
a
collision
with
a
person,
and
the
death
of
that
person
resulted
in
another
charge
or
two
other
charges
being
filed
against
that
same
man,
those
charges
being
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
he
could,
your
honor,
and
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
say
i
simply
think
the
state
in
this
case,
they
simply
erred
and
they
are
coming
before
this
court
and
saying
would
you
please
rectify
our
error
because
we
don't
want
to
set
a
bad
precedent
in
illinois.
this
wouldn't
happen
in
an
adult
case.
it
would
not
have
happened
if
the
state
had
kept
its
eye
on
things.
after
all,
this
young
man
was
charged
on
november
20,
1974,
with
a
traffic
offense.
he
was
tried
a
month
later.
they
had
plenty
of
time.
the
juvenile
officer
in
south
holland
necessarily
had
to
go
to
the
juvenile
court,
which
is
loaded
with
states
attorneys,
get
the
necessary
petitions
to
file
for
an
adjudication
of
delinquency,
he
obviously
had
those
in
his
--
i
mean
this
is
supposition,
but
he
had
to
have
them
at
least
the
next
day
after
the
trial
because
we
are
talking
about
a
trial
that
john
vitale
went
through,
and
now
the
state
is
saying
we
want
another
trial
because
he
only
had
a
$15
fine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
argument
with
the
offenses,
i
have
the
argument
with
the
multiple
trials.
there
can
be
separate
offenses
tried
in
a
single
proceeding,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
take
one
act
and
charge
a
number
of
offenses
out
of
that
act
and
then
have
separate
and
successive
prosecutions
except
in
extremely
limited
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
well,
i
agree
completely
with
the
holding
in
ash
v.
swanson
because,
as
i
understand
that
case,
it
was
simply
a
question
of
identity
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
know,
but
i
mean
double
jeopardy
applies
whether
there
is
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
in
extremely
limited
circumstances.
if
they
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
will
stay
right
there.
i
said
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
hard
cases
make
bad
law.
i
feel
very
bad.
in
fact,
i
happen
to
know
one
of
the
parents
of
the
children
who
was
killed,
a
police
officer
in
south
holland.
it
is
extremely
unfortunate,
but
i
cannot,
because
those
are
the
factual
circumstances,
take
any
different
position
than
any
other
lawyer
could
as
far
as
my
client's
rights
are
concerned.
the
state
knew
what
they
were
supposed
to
do.
they
have
certain
requirements
that
are
placed
on
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
without
compulsory
joinder
statutes?
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
would
i
still
be
here?
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
i
do
think
it
is
double
jeopardy
in
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far.
i
am
very
aware
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
and
mr.
justice
marshall's
transaction
test.
i
don't
think
we
even
need
go
that
far.
i
agree
with
them
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far
because
we
are
not
talking
about
one
transaction,
we
are
talking
about
one
act.
there
was
an
act
of
an
accident,
that
accident
resulted
in
a
traffic
charge
and
two
deaths.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
if
you
can
take
that
one
act,
you
could
create
not
only
the
offense
of
failing
to
reduce
speed
to
avoid
an
accident,
you
could
also
create
involuntary
manslaughter,
you
could
create
reckless
homicide,
you
could
create
reckless
conduct,
reckless
driving,
failing
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
all
i
am
saying
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
i
say
you
could
prosecute
those
offenses
but
you
have
to
do
it
in
one
trial.
you
can't
take
one
after
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
no,
that
is
what
i
started
with,
your
honor,
in
our
own
compulsory
joinder
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
i
still
think
all
charges
that
arise
out
of
one
act,
the
separate
offenses
can
be
tried
but
they
have
to
be
tried
together.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
well,
our
compulsory
joinder
statute
does
provide
that,
so
that
is
a
good
place
to
start.
i
mean,
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
judge,
i
am
not
going
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
i
couldn't
more
agree
with
you.
i
am
simply
stating
my
position
philosophically,
but
i
do
agree
with
the
decision
of
justice
dooley.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
all
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
your
honor,
it
was
a
class
c
misdemeanor,
it
could
have
carried
up
to
a
$500
fine
and
30
days
in
jail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
dirksen
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
