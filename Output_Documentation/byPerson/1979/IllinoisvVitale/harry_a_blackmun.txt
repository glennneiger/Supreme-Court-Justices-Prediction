justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
two
problems
with
your
argument
and
i
would
like
you
to
perhaps
comment
on
it.
first
of
all,
in
the
statute
which
is
set
out
at
page
a6
in
the
petition,
there
is
an
"(a)"
on
the
manslaughter
and
there
is
a
"(b)"
that
says,
"if
the
acts
which
cause
the
death
consist
of
the
driving
of
a
motor
vehicle,"
and
then
it
goes
on,
which
is
i
take
it
a
sub-category
of
the
voluntary
manslaughter.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is,
of
course,
the
sub-category
we
have
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
which
is,
i
gather,
a
lesser
included
offense
within--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
would
you
say
that
the
reckless
driving
of
a
vehicle
is
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
offense
of
reckless
homicide?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
sort
of
a
pyramid,
the
broadest
category
is
the
involuntary
manslaughter,
included
within
that
category
is
the
species
reckless
homicide
and
an
even
lesser
within
that
category
is
the
reckless
driving
of
the
vehicle.
each
is
lesser
of
the
next
step
up.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
statutory
definition
of
failure
to
reduce
speed
is
not
limited
to
cases
of
failure
to
reduce
speed
but
also
include
driving
at
a
speed
that
is
greater
than
reasonable
and
proper
and
so
forth.
there
are
a
lot
of
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
the
question
is,
i
suppose
--
let
me
put
it
a
little
differently
--
the
indictment
for
manslaughter
that
is
quoted
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
alleges
that
john
m.
vitale
has
on
or
about
so-and-so
committed
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
in
that,
he
without
lawful
justification,
while
recklessly
driving
a
motor
vehicle,
caused
the
death
of
george
kech.
could
they
prove
that
charge
without
also
proving
a
violation
of
failing
to
reduce
speed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
just
ask
this
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
speed
a
necessary
element
in
a
manslaughter
conviction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
would
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
you
could
have
a
car
trying
to
leave
a
parking
space
that
backed
up
at
one
mile
an
hour
and
crushed
somebody
behind
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
doesn't
that
suggest
that
speed
is
not
an
element?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
you
had
a
mechanic
underneath
an
automobile
and
one
got
in
it
and
drove
off
without
looking,
he
would
drive
off,
how
could
he
reduce
it
below
zero?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
a
good
place
to
finish,
too.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
thirty
days.
