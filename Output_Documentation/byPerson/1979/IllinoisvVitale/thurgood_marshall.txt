was
all
of
this
argued
before
the

law
this
was
not
--
was
all
of
this
argued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you

opportunity
to
argue
it,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
the
first
time
there

an
opportunity
to
argue
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
saying
that
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
are
entitled
to
is
an
opportunity
to
present
your
argument,
that
is
all
you
have
a
right
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
a
right
to
ask
somebody
else
to
do
your
arguing
for
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
shouldn't
think
the
state
of
illinois
would
need
any
help.
