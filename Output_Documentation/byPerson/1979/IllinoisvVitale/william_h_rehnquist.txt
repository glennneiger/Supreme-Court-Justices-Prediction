justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
veldman,
didn't
mr.
justice
dooley
recognize
that
in
page
a7
and
page
a8
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
where
he
says,
'as
is
usually
the
situation
between
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses,
the
lesser
offense,
failing
to
reduce
speed,
requires
no
proof
beyond
that
which
is
necessary
for
conviction
of
the
greater,
involuntary
manslaughter.
accordingly,
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
greater
offense
is
by
definition
the
'same'
as
the
lesser
offense
included
within
it."
couldn't
you
read
that
as
itself
being
constrained
by
his
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
relied
on
the
illinois
statute
barring
prosecutions
analogous
to
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
there
ever
been
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
either
of
these
two
charges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
prevent
them,
if
we
tell
them
they
were
wrong
on
federal
grounds,
when
it
goes
back
to
them,
saying,
all
right,
we
were
wrong
on
the
federal
grounds,
we
will
now
address
the
state
grounds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
have
a
drunk
driving
down
the
street
at
four
miles
an
hour,
couldn't
you
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
not
saying
under
no
circumstances
under
federal
jeopardy
could
he
be
tried
for
two
totally
separate
offenses,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
statement
in
ash
v.
swinson
that
you
could
bring
a
person
to
trial
for
killing
six
different
poker
players
if
he
had
not
been
acquitted
in
the
first
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
an
acquittal
in
ash.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
can't
try
a
man
for
two
different
offenses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
asking
them
for
a
principle
that
has
never
been
enunciated
by
this
court
if
for
one
act
you
can
only
be
charged
once.
certainly,
brown
v.
ohio
doesn't
say
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
rely
on
from
this
court
for
that
proposition?
hopefully
this
one?
