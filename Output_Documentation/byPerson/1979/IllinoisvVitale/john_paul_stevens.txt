wouldn't
it
necessarily
have
proved
that
he
was
driving
recklessly
and
without
proper
regard
to
traffic
conditions
and
the
use
of
the
highway
in
a
way
that
endangered
the
safety
of
any
person
or
property?
wouldn't
it
necessarily
prove
that
he
endangered
the
safety
of
the
person
he
killed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
the
statute
calls
--
that
is
the
statutory
definition
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
veldman,
it
occurs
to
me
that
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law,
we
do
have
an
opinion
of
the
intermediate,
the
appellate
court
to
the
effect
that
these
two
offenses
are
the
same
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
illinois
criminal
code.
that
holding
was
not
reviewed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
apparently
went
on
federal
grounds.
but
the
highest
court
of
the
state
which
has
spoken
to
the
issue
has
told
us
that
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
we
have
the
same
offense,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
aren't
we
bound
by
the
teaching
of
the
highest
court
of
illinois
that
tells
us
anything
about
a
state
law
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
unreversed
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
illinois
supreme
court
may
have
merely
said
yes
and,
oh,
by
the
way,
it
also
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
certainly
took
the
state
grounds
to
them,
didn't
you?
you
must
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
about
the
only
ground
you
took
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
veldman,
is
that
really
quite
correct?
at
page
a3
of
the
petition,
after
reviewing
the
proceeding
in
the
appellate
court,
they
conclude
that
that
court
had
concluded
that
the
appellate
court
concluded
that
the
acts
in
both
the
offense
of
failure
to
reduce
speed
and
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter
were
identical
with
the
exception
in
the
manslaughter
offense
a
death
was
involved.
then
they
said
it
follows
from
that
that
under
the
illinois
statute
3(b),
since
the
prosecutor
knew
about
both
at
the
same
time,
as
a
matter
of
state
law
dismissal
was
required.
then
they
said
after
that
there
is
an
even
more
compelling
reason
for
dismissal
giving
this
hypothesis,
that
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
also
requires
dismissal.
now,
what
is
the
federal
error
in
that
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
federal
error
did
the
illinois
supreme
court
commit,
given
the
identity
of
the
offenses
which
the
appellate
court
had
found
and
which
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
disagree
with
but
merely
said
we
need
not
rely
on
the
state
statute
that
requires
dismissal
when
identical
offenses
are
involved,
we
can
rely
on
the
federal
constitution
that
requires
dismissal
when
identical
offenses
are
involved.
what
is
the
federal
error
that
that
court
committed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
latter
theory
is
a
state
law
question.
what
was
its
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
argument
in
the
illinois
appellate
court.
i
gather
you
did
represent
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
state
argue
that
even
on
the
assumption
that
the
offenses
are
identical,
one
being
included
within
the
other,
nevertheless
the
illinois
state
compulsory
joinder
statute
is
not
applicable
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
juvenile
proceedings
or
doesn't
apply
to
traffic
offenses
or
something
of
that
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
argued
that
it
did
not
apply
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
is
it
possible
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
saying
is,
well,
we
have
identical
offenses
here,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
the
state
compulsory
joinder
statute
applies
because
in
any
event
when
you've
got
the
same
offenses
you've
got
the
protection
under
the
federal
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
right,
there
isn't
anything
more
to
say,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
be
here,
would
you
be
making
this
argument
except
for
the
state
statute,
the
compulsory
joinder
rule?
well,
let's
suppose
that
there
had
been
no
state
rule
at
all
and
there
had
been
those
same
prosecutions
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
who
said
this
was
double
jeopardy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
compulsory
joinder
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
be
arguing
that
the
--
would
you
be
supporting
the
supreme
court
of
illinois'
result
on
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
think
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
double
jeopardy
irregardless
of
state
law,
this
is
not
double
jeopardy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
is
double
jeopardy.
but
you
would
say
that
there
is
a
one
transaction
test,
or
don't
you?
