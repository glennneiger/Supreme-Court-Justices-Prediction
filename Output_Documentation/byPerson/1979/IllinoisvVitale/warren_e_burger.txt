chief
justice

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1845,
illinois
v.
vitale.
mr.
veldman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
trying
to
suggest
to
us
that
when
a
state
court
is
construing
the
federal
constitution
that
presents
a
different
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
veldman,
you
may
resume
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly
the
corollary
is
not
true,
that
the
manslaughter
charge
requires
proof
of
the
homicide,
whereas
the
lesser
included
offense
doesn't
to
have
a
homicide
or
even
an
accident.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
make
all
these
arguments
to
the
illinois
supreme
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
arguing
just
the
state
law
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
veldman,
hypothetically
--
this
is
a
further
hypothetical
--
you
could
persuade
us
that
there
was
some
basis
for
reversing
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
on
their
federal
holding,
would
there
be
anything
to
prevent
that
court
when
the
case
was
remanded
from
in
effect
adopting
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
putting
it
on
state
grounds
and
therefore
impervious
to
any
challenge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
anyone
preclude
them
from
saying,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
just
suggested,
the
inverse
of
what
you
suggested,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
if
the
is
the
attitude
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
all
right,
we
will
decide
it
on
state
grounds
and
then
decide
it
just
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
responding
to
the
question
now
or
are
you
continuing
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
respond
to
the
question.
respond
to
the
question,
please.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dirksen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
raised
that
on
state
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
federal
double
jeopardy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
federal
or
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
you
agree
that
we
can't
examine
the
basis
of
the
state
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
standing
on
the
illinois
law
when
you
make
that
argument,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hear
none,
counsel.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
