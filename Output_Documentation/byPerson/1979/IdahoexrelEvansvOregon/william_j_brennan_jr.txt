is
that
really
the
question?
the
executive
agencies
have
no
business
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
they
do
it
by
just
intervening,
bringing
a
lawsuit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
stating
a
claim?
that
is
the
way
they
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree.
their
refusal
to
intervene
is
the
same
--
operates
the
same
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
united
states
intervened
here
and
stated
its
own
claim,
it
would
not
be
a
matter
of
waiving
immunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
has
--
the
agencies
have
no
power
to
waive
immunity
but
they
could
have
power
to
bring
this
lawsuit,
or
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
lose
those
runs
even
though
--
under
the
present
system
--
even
though
there
is
some
provision
for
escapement
to
maintain
the
runs,
it
would
still
be
possible
to
lose
them
because
of
what
happens
between
escapement
and
idaho.
