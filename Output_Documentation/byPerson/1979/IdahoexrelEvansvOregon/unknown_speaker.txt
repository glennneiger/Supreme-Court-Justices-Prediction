unknown
speaker
well,
there
must
be
--
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
that
could
be
--
that
just
means
that
the
escapement
--
permitted
escapement
or
required
escapement
is
inadequate.
unknown
speaker
you
are
arguing
the
merits
of
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
merit.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
after
the
'66
amendments
which
prior
to
1966
definitely
classified
parties.
one
class
was
necessary,
another
class
was
indispensable,
and
their
characteristics
were
quite
different.
in
the
1966
amendments
you
come
along
and
dispense
with
word
"indispensable"
entirely.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
merit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
the
idaho
says
now
--
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
a
fact
or
not,
but
the
attorney
general
said
that
20
percent
of
the
fish
that
originate
in
idaho
get
back
to
idaho.
so
some
fish
get
there.
and
they
just
think
that
more
should
be
released.
if
you
release
200
instead
of
100,
you
are
going
to
have
more
fish
reach
idaho.
unknown
speaker
but
we
waited
for
four
years
for
oregon
and
washington
to
include
idaho
in
the
interstate
compact,
and
they
never
did.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
indicate
that
a
combination
is
impossible?
unknown
speaker
it
is
possible
on
your
terms.
unknown
speaker
i
am
interested
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
mentioned
washington.
unknown
speaker
but
you
still
say
a
combination
is
possible.
unknown
speaker
which
district
court
was
that?
unknown
speaker
attorney
general,
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
indispensability
for
a
minute.
as
i
understand
idaho's
story,
they
say
we
don't
get
enough
fish
because
some
fish
are
lost
over
the
dams,
there
is
some
over-fishing
by
indians,
and
there
is
some
over-fishing
in
oregon
and
washington.
so
we
can't
do
anything
about
the
first
two
items
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity.
but
we
can
do
something
about
over-fishing
in
oregon
and
washington.
just
let
us
get
that
much.
why
is
the
united
states
indispensable
under
that
part
of
their
claim?
unknown
speaker
if
we
accept
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
because
the
case
hasn't
been
tried
yet,
we
can't
accept
your
statement,
because
they
have
alleged
to
the
contrary
on
that.
they
have
alleged
that
there
are
runs
that
originate
in
idaho
and,
being
anadromous
return
to
idaho,
which
are
over-fished
in
oregon
and
washington.
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
true
for
the
purpose
of
the
decision
today?
unknown
speaker
and
the
master
said
there
is
an
inequity
here,
too.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
finding
that
you
could
point
to
in
the
master's
report
that
supports
what
you
have
said?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
is
--
he
did
think
there
was
something
to
try
out
in
this
case
except
for
the
fact
that
the
united
states
wasn't
there.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
only
a
problem
about
remedy
with
respect
to
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
answer
of
your
colleague
to
my
last
question
to
him?
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
gone
forward
with
this
case.
i
agree
with
that
part
of
mr.
redden's
answer,
but
not
with
the
answer
that
the
only
question
before
him
was
a
remedy.
there
was
a
question
before
him
as
to
whether
there
was
a
right.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
point
in
my
arguing
that
to
you
now.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
is
that
what
you
want
to
argue,
whether
there
is
a
right?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
fish
these
runs.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happens
to
these
runs,
then?
unknown
speaker
but
if
commercial
fisheries
don't
fish
these
three
runs,
you
certainly
are
not
going
to
have
to
alter
your
commercial
fishing.
unknown
speaker
what
about
arizona
v.
california?
