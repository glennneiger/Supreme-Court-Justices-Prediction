justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
final
report,
i
ask
you.
did
the
special
master
indicate
that
the
case
could
go
forward
without
infringing
on
indian
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
it
the
prospect
of
enforcing
the
decree
against
indians
that
led
him
to,
or
at
least
help
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
united
states
was
an
indispensable
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
those
two
jibe,
anyway,
if
you
--
if
there
is
no
real
need
of
interfering
with
indian
rights;
what
enforcement
against
the
indians
would
have
to
take
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
willing
to
take
your
chances
on
all
of
those,
aren't
you?
i
take
it
your
narrow
focus
is
just
to
have
a
greater
escapement
above
bonneville.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
may
be
a
lot
of
risks
involved,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
the
risks
are,
you
are
willing
to
take
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
i
take
it
--
and
perhaps
i
am
wrong
--
are
you
giving
up
any
theory
of
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
explain
the
way
the
language
in
section
702
of
the
apa
that
refers
to
agency
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
inquire
a
little
more
on
the
subject
of
indispensability
you
touched
but
not
really
covered
exhaustively,
as
i
understand
it.
supposing
you
got
an
order
that
said
that
oregon
and
washington
shall
take
a
smaller
share
of
the
fish
before
they
reach
the
bonneville
dam.
they
say,
well,
maybe
we
will
do
that
but
then
the
indians
will
take
a
larger
share
when
they
are
passing
through
zone
6
and
no
more
fish
will
get
to
idaho
when
everything
is
all
done.
how
in
this
case
can
the
court
enter
an
order
which
would
give
idaho
more
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter
as
they
go
through
zone
6
don't
they
assume
50
percent
has
been
taken
out
by
oregon
and
washington
before
the
fish
get
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
i
can
understand
it,
when
those
numbers
are
fixed
do
they
fix
the
numbers
that
the
indians
can
take
when
the
fish
go
through
zone
6?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
basically
they
would
reduce
the
oregon
and
washington
numbers
without
affecting
the
indian
numbers
and
there
would
therefore
be
a
margin
left
over
that
has
still
survived
on
over
the
dam?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
leroy,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
united
states
simply
be
left
out
as
a
party
involuntarily
and
that
your
case
proceed
against
idaho
and
washington?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
feel
that
idaho
has
been
pushed
around
by
these
two
larger
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
leroy,
before
you
stop
is
it
possible
--
and
maybe
this
is
unrealistic
question
--
to
give
me
some
indication
of
what
percentage
of
the
run
idaho
is
now
getting
and
what
percentage
of
the
run
it
hopes
to
get
if
it
is
totally
successful
in
this
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
20
percent
figure,
that
is
the
percent
of
the
fish
that
originate
in
idaho
and
return
to
idaho,
that
is
not
the
percent
that
are
caught
by
your
fishermen,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
20
percent
refer
to?
is
that
the
percent
that
actually
get
back
to
idaho
or
is
that
the
percent
of
the
run
that
are
caught
by
fishermen
in
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
was
really
asking,
the
20-percent
figure
i
don't
think
responds
to
my
question.
what
percent
of
the
run
do
idaho
fishermen
now
catch?
do
we
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
really
seeking
to
do
is
to
increase
that
figure
to
a
higher
figure.
justice
byron
r.
white
pardon
me.
and,
secondly,
to
increase
the
sport
fishery
in
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
that
prevents
those
fish
from
ever
getting
to
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
this
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action.
i
guess
you
are
arguing
your
exceptions
to
this
special
master,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
the
special
master
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
case
went
forward
these
matters
would
certainly
be
litigated,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
you
seem
to
be
arguing
here
that
we
should
just
dismiss
the
case,
not
because
of
indispensability
but
just
because
idaho
hasn't
got
any
claim
on,
that
it
can
really
have
any
profit
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
idaho
says,
well,
sure,
the
united
states
may
run
these
dams
so
that
the
relief
we
get,
if
we
get
any
relief,
might
not
be
as
good
as
it
might
otherwise
be
and
sure,
the
indians
may
fish
for
more
fish
than
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
decree
entered
in
another
case.
but
that
is
no
reason,
it
is
argued,
saying
the
united
states
is
either
necessary
or
indispensable.
idaho
is
willing
to
take
that
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
spell
that
out
for
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
the
united
states
had
moved
to
intervene
before
the
special
master
and
the
special
master
allowed
it
and
we
didn't
object
to
it,
i
take
it
the
special
master
would
have
said
the
case
should
now
go
forward
and
be
tried.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
just
saying
you
are
bound
to
in
your
suit
before
the
special
master.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
certainly
think
that
the
case
might
be
very
different
and
the
decree
might
be
very
different
if
the
united
states
were
a
party;
there
would
be
other
things
that
might
happen.
but
without
it,
it
may
be
that
oregon
will
just
end
up
with
no
relief
at
all
or
it
is
just
impossible.
they
may
just
lose
on
the
merits.
but
i
don't
understand
why
whatever
there
is,
however
small
the
pie
is,
why
oregon
isn't
entitled
to
litigate
whether
it
is
getting
its
fair
share
of
that
pie.
i
mean
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
idaho
doesn't
want
the
united
--
hasn't
asked
for
any
relief
against
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nor
have
any
indian
tribes.
so
it
is
quite
willing
to
take
its
lumps
if
the
united
states
wants
to
keep
its
head
in
the
sand
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
idaho
assert
in
that
case
any
claim
against
two
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
it
wants
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
keep
the
door
closed
completely
until
you
are
ready
to
intervene
in
some
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
decree
could
not
be
entered
in
favor
of
idaho
against
the
other
two
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
is
it
possible
in
the
management
of
the
commercial
and
sports
fishery
below
bonneville
to
effect
a
greater
escapement
of
fish
that
would
go
to
idaho
without
affecting
an
escapement
of
a
greater
number
of
fish
that
would
go
elsewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
washington
seemed
to
be
arguing
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
escapement
of
a
great
many
other
fish
that
were
never
destined
for
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
part
of
the
merit.
