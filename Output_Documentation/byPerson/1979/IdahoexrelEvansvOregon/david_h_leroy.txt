mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
idaho
appears
for
the
second
time
before
the
court
in
its
effort
to
seek
a
fair
share
of
idaho-raised
and
idaho-returning
anadromous
fish
runs.
this
court's
opinion
earlier
this
year
in
july
in
washington
v.
united
states
made
the
court
again
familiar
with
the
general
nature
of
these
fish
and
the
general
issues
regarding
allocation.
however,
the
idaho
case
is
very
different.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
columbia
river
system
only.
there
is
an
existing
district
court
and
ninth
circuit-affirmed
allocation
order
and
management
plan
which
already
equitably
divides
up
the
treaty
and
non-treaty
shares
of
fish
between
the
indians
so
entitled
in
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington,
and
that
equitable
division
is
not
contested.
idaho
makes
no
claim
in
this
case
against
indian
treaty
fishery.
rather,
it
seeks
only
a
further
equitable
distribution
of
the
already
established
non-treaty
shares
to
include
idaho.
nevertheless,
we
appear
this
morning
at
grave
procedural
disadvantage.
if
this
court
accepts
the
recommendation
of
its
distinguished
master
it
will
dismiss
idaho's
case
before
we
reach
the
obvious
merits
which
that
same
master
finds
in
the
matter.
the
facts
are
these.
the
columbia
river
for
the
last
300
miles
of
its
course
to
the
pacific
ocean
becomes
the
boundary
line
dividing
oregon
and
washington.
the
snake
river
flows
through
idaho
and
then
into
washington
to
join
the
columbia,
becoming
its
principal
tributary.
in
idaho
there
are
over
3,000
miles
of
spawning
habitat
for
anadromous
fish,
freshwater
fish
which
after
a
two-year
life
cycle
migrate
to
the
ocean
to
share
a
similar
cycle
there,
then
return
to
their
native
waters
to
spawn
and
propagate
the
species.
in
1918
washington
and
oregon
with
the
blessing
of
congress
created
a
columbia
river
compact
to
administer
the
non-treaty
fishery
rights
and
to
cooperate
with
indian
rights
under
1855
treaties.
for
40
to
60
years
last
past
idaho
has
sought
membership
unsuccessfully
in
this
compact
by
entreaties
to
oregon
and
to
washington.
in
1969
disputes
between
the
indian
and
non-indian
fishery
on
the
columbia
river
resulted
in
two
pieces
of
litigation
being
consolidated
and
being
decided
in
the
district
court
of
oregon,
sohappy
v.
smith
and
the
united
states
v.
oregon
regarding
oregon's
regulation
scheme
of
the
indian
fish
and
its
impact
on
the
indian
fishery.
the
united
states
as
tribal
trustee
in
those
district
court
cases
was
a
voluntary
party
and
is
accordingly
bound
by
the
decree.
in
1974
the
district
court
in
oregon
amended
the
earlier
decree
to
establish
a
50-50
allocation
between
treaty
and
non-treaty
rights
of
the
anadromous
fish
which
was
affirmed
in
1976
by
the
ninth
circuit.
and
in
1977
the
parties,
including
the
united
states
and
including
oregon
and
washington,
entered
into
a
voluntary
agreement
which
in
some
slight
parts
amended
the
prior
decree
and
established
a
basic
framework
for
the
counting,
distribution
and
allocation
of
those
fish
into
the
two
shares
and
establishing
zones
of
fishery,
the
non-treaty
zone
being
established
in
the
first
140
miles
of
the
river
from
the
ocean
upstream
to
bonneville
dam
and
the
treaty
indian
fishery
zone
being
established
as
zone
6
from
bonneville
dam
130
miles
further
up
the
columbia
river.
in
1975
idaho
sought
leave
of
this
court
to
file
a
complaint
seeking
two
things.
first,
membership
in
the
compact;
and
secondly,
an
equitable
apportionment
of
three
of
those
anadromous
fish
runs,
the
spring
chinook
salmon,
the
summer
chinook
salmon
and
the
summer
steelhead
trout.
we
urged
in
that
litigation
that
where
more
than
half
of
the
returning
adults
which
reentered
the
columbia
river
had
been
raised
in
idaho
and
would
return
if
unimpeded
to
idaho,
that
current
management
practices
of
the
defendants
both
denied
idaho
a
fair
share
of
those
fish
and
gravely
threatened
the
propagation
and
continued
existence
of
the
species.
we
were
granted
by
this
court
after
oral
argument,
leave
to
file
the
complaint
as
to
the
equitable
apportionment
issue
only.
this
court
appointed
the
honorable
jean
breitenstein
master
and
in
due
course,
on
july
31,
1978,
he
issued
an
initial
report
with
three
conclusions.
number
one,
that
the
complaint
stated
a
justiciable
controversy;
and
that
the
pendency
of
u.s.
v.
oregon
was
no
bar
to
this
action,
to
which
findings
both
oregon
and
washington
accepted;
and
third
was
that
the
u.s.
did
not
consent
to
this
suit,
that
it
had
a
number
of
interrelated
interests
and
that
this
decree
without
the
presence
of
the
united
states
in
the
litigation
could
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
the
second
finding
of
the
court
was
the
pendency
of
the
u.s.
v.
oregon
and
sohappy
v.
smith's
judgments.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
they
were
no
bar
to
the
action;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
thus
the
master,
concluding
that
the
united
states
was
a
necessary
party,
recommended
dismissal,
to
which
idaho
accepted
on
four
grounds.
number
one,
that
the
federal
interest
in
this
matter
could
be
adequately
represented
by
amicus-type
status;
secondly,
that
the
finding
of
indefensibility
by
the
master
was
in
error;
third,
that
a
determination
by
this
court
of
the
matter
would
not
unduly
burden
the
court;
and
fourth,
that
the
alternative
of
mutual
accommodation
was
not
available.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
his
findings
were,
applying
the
test
of
rule
19,
that
as
to
parts
1
and
2
of
that
rule
regarding
the
necessary
nature,
that
the
very
narrow
nature
of
this
lawsuit
addressing
only
the
non-indian
share
would
in
fact
cause
no
loss
of
rights
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
the
master's
basic
concern
was
that
without
party
status
there
was
no
guarantee
that
idaho's
benefits
from
this
lawsuit
could
be
forced
upstream
if
they
were
decreed
through
that
zone
6
indian
fishery.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
rule
19
as
it
now
stands
talks
of
persons
to
be
joined
if
feasible
and
persons
where
in
subpart
b
that
must
be
present
to
give
an
adequacy
to
the
judgment.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
would
urge
that
to
the
court
and
we
would
urge
that
this
type
of
approach
need
be
particularly
flexible
in
a
case
of
original
jurisdiction
where
a
substantial
detriment
to
a
precious
natural
resource
may
occur.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
in
terms
of
idaho's
preference
we
would
like
to
see
the
united
states
involved
as
a
party.
in
fact
we
have
lobbied
the
united
states
considerably
to
that
objective.
but
our
point
in
urging
to
the
court
that
the
master
was
in
error
in
ruling
that
they
were
a
necessary
party
to
give
adequacy
to
a
judgment
in
this
litigation,
is
that
the
very
delay
which
that
a
dismissal
may
occasion
or
in
fact
at
worst
if
we
are
barred
from
all
access
to
this
court
and
other
appropriate
remedy,
not
only
would
our
equitable
rights
be
lost
but
so
also
well
may
be
the
runs
of
fish
upon
which
we
sued.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
the
united
states
at
this
point
in
time,
your
honor,
by
a
split
executive
decision
has
determined
that
they
would
not
waive
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
are
well
aware
of
the
basic
proposition
that
it
is
congress
that
is
empowered
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
but,
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
declination
to
be
legally
involved
in
this
case
by
justice
offers
the
same
kind
of
bar
at
the
expense
of
sovereignty.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
the
master
entered
a
final
report
in
this
matter
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
urge
to
the
court
that
in
this
case
the
court
might
consider
reviving
the
florida
v.
georgia
reinstitution
of
special
amicus-type
status.
as
the
court
will
recall,
in
that
matter
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
wished
to
intervene
in
a
boundary
dispute
between
those
two
states.
and
to
avoid
technical
dismissal
and
to
avoid
defeating
jurisdiction
in
that
original
action,
upon
a
theory
that
the
court
could
discount
unnecessary
technicalities,
upon
a
theory
that
procedural
devices
were
within
the
program
of
this
court
to
allow
the
continuance
and
acceptance
of
its
constitutional
mandate
if
in
a
special
status
allow
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
without
becoming
a
full
party
to
participate
in
argument,
to
cross-examine
witnesses,
to
produce
evidence,
we
urged
the
court
as
we
have
in
our
brief
that
especially
now,
given
the
complexity
and
pervasiveness
of
the
federal
government,
given
the
fact
that
there
is
a
much
greater
frequency
of
interchange
between
the
states
than
there
was
in
1855
when
that
decision
came
out,
that
that
concept
of
special
amicus-style
status
to
the
extent
that
there
are
interests
in
this
matter,
is
a
concept
ripe
for
reinstitution.
in
addition
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
we
urge
that
the
master's
finding
that
there
need
be
involvement
of
the
united
states
is
wrong.
our
argument
is
simple
and
brief
in
that
regard.
we
say
that
there
was
general
agreement
between
the
parties
and
the
master
as
we
proceeded
through
the
matter,
that
supreme
court
rule
9
made
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
19
useful
in
measuring
indispensability
in
this
kind
of
case.
partly
the
master
found
favorably
to
idaho
under
rule
19
because
the
narrow
framing
of
the
issue,
he
found
that
there
would
be
no
prejudice
to
the
united
states,
that
there
would
be
no
loss
of
u.s.
rights;
and,
secondly,
he
found
that
idaho
would
have
no
other
--
no
adequate
remedy
of
law.
but
the
master
was
concerned
about
the
adequacy
of
the
judgment
on
three
factors,
the
operation
of
eight
dams
along
the
snake
and
columbia
river
by
the
corps
of
engineers;
on
the
indian
trustee
status
relationship
to
fishing
rights
in
general;
and
third,
on
the
united
states
government's
control
and
management
of
the
specific
fishery.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
are
willing
to
take
our
chances
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
think
not
as
to
the
united
states
for
these
reasons.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
are,
your
honor,
and
we
suggest
that
a
large
portion
of
those
risks
attributable
to
the
united
states
are
relatively
fixed
and
are
relatively
calculable
and
can
be
equitably
apportioned
along
with
the
fish
between
idaho,
oregon
and
washington.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
at
all.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
have
argued
this
morning
before
the
court
that
the
presence
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
on
the
books
of
the
united
states
code
and
the
combination
of
beginning
and
developing
judicial
precedent
applying
that
act
to
acts
of
the
united
states,
including
operations
of
the
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
we
can
and
we
can't.
the
statute
goes
on
to
mention
a
number
of
other
things
and
in
some
respects
agency
action,
we
would
urge,
includes
all
manner
of
action
by
the
officers,
agents,
employees
of
the
united
states
government.
but
our
basic
concern
in
this
matter
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
are
suggesting
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
its
very
terms
is
limited
to
non-monetary
damages
and
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
classic
action
or
failure
to
act
in
an
official
capacity
if
there
be
some
threat
to
the
anadromous
fish
by
the
operation
of
the
dams,
by
something
that
is
done
off
the
pacific
coast
fishery.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
would
urge
the
fact
that
justice
cannot
refuse
or
reserve
what
congress
has
already
waived.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
we
argue
from
that
is
that
even
should
this
court
judge
the
united
states
a
necessary
party,
that
at
worst
idaho
should
be
allowed
to
amend
its
pleading
because
of
that
concept
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
we
urge
it
has
been
waived
by
congress.
frankly,
we
would
also
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
method
and
the
purpose
of
the
attempted
exercise
of
non-intervention
by
the
solicitor.
in
california
v.
arizona
the
focus
of
that
congressional
waiver,
or
focus
of
that
case
was
congressional
waiver
by
statute.
in
this
case,
the
same
side
of
a
similar
coin,
by
split
decision
the
department
of
justice
chose
not
to
be
involved
in
the
matter.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
justice
should
not
have
that
authority,
but
the
preliminary
policy
determination
by
justice,
exhibit
c
to
the
idaho
brief,
shows
that
the
rationale
for
that
legal
decision
was
to
avoid
short-term
political
inconvenience.
the
court,
we
suggest,
should
appropriately
comment,
perhaps
use
the
florida
v.
georgia
procedural
device,
but
in
any
event,
do
what
it
can
to
avoid
damaging
this
precious
natural
resource
by
looking
behind
that
legal
tactic
in
a
sense,
for
that
legal
tactic
is
not
consistent
with
overall
national
public
policy.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
the
sohappy
and
u.s.
v.
oregon
decisions
bind
the
indians
to
a
50-percent
treaty
right
share
by
decree.
the
voluntary
agreement
which
i
mentioned
varies
that
figure
from
40
to
60
percent,
depending
on
the
specific
run
of
fish.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
that
50
percent
is
projected
under
the
voluntary
agreement
into
a
matrix
of
specific
numbers
of
fish
for
the
specific
runs
and
a
specific
entitlement
to
each
fishery.
so
we
urge
that
the
same
way,
that
an
escapement
a
minimum
number
for
preservation
of
the
species
is
allowed
through
zone
6.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
structure.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
exactly.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
indians
over-fished
above
those
numbers
they
would
be
subjected
to
possible
enforcement
of
and
requirement
that
the
benefits
pass
through
by
intervention
of
idaho
for
the
limited
purpose
of
assuring
that
the
benefits
come
to
idaho.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
as
i
suggested
in
answer
to
your
earlier
question
we
feel
that
the
master's
focus,
regardless
of
term,
was
the
adequacy
of
the
judgment.
one
of
his
problems
was
the
problem
that
we
just
discussed
that
the
idaho
benefit
as
to
the
indian
rights
could
not
pass
through.
i
have
attempted
to
suggest
that
in
fact
it
would
be
a
pass
through
just
as
the
escapement
is
and
idaho
could
enforce
that
by
intervention
if
it
so
had
to.
in
addition,
the
operation
of
the
dams
by
the
united
states
in
a
specific
fishery
we
suggest
are
factually
irrelevant
to
the
relief
that
we
seek
and
so
i
would
not
follow
the
court's
reasoning
in
suggesting
that
the
term
be
different
but
in
fact
the
adequacy
of
the
judgment
can
be
preserved
regardless
of
the
term.
we
argue
also
that
the
master
was
incorrect
in
suggesting
that
the
operation
of
the
united
states
of
dams
--
eight
dams
on
the
columbia
river
made
them
a
party
whose
presence
is
required
in
this
lawsuit.
there
are
eight
dams.
those
dams
each
create
reservoirs
or
pools,
they
create
spills,
they
have
fish
ladders,
they
alter
stream
flows,
and
all
of
those
factors
kill
fish.
but
in
a
sense
of
relevancy
to
this
matter
and
interrelationship,
that
problem,
the
mortality
of
the
fish,
in
that
fashion
is
not
relevant
to
the
relief
sought
or
the
judgment
requested
in
this
case.
the
focus
here
is
the
equitable
apportionment
between
the
three
states
of
adult
fish
regardless
of
whatever
supply
that
reenter
the
columbia
river
at
its
mouth
on
their
up
turn,
upstream
migration.
at
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river
for
the
first
time
these
fish
become
the
subject
of
commercial
and
sport
fishery
in
the
river;
and
for
the
first
time
they
become
subject
to
an
actual
count
which
can
be
apportioned
between.
thus,
we
urge
that
the
master's
concern
with
the
operations
of
the
dam
as
to
downstream
migration
is
irrelevant.
it
may
affect
the
total
supply
but
it
does
not
relate
to
the
right
of
a
portion
of
those
adult
fish
reentering
which
we
seek.
as
to
the
upstream
migration,
three
factors
make
that
factually
irrelevant
as
well.
the
apportionment
occurs
at
and
before
the
first
dam,
thus
u.s.
operations
are
not
in
a
position
to
affect
the
calculation
of
the
basic
equities
and
numbers
between
the
states.
secondly,
the
upstream
losses
are
certain,
are
capable
of
calculation
and
thus
can
be
factored
into
a
scheme
of
equitable
apportionment,
such
as
this
court
has
done
in
some
water
loss
and
water
passage
cases.
and
third,
the
federal
statutes
as
judicially
interpreted
require
a
sensitivity
by
the
united
states
government,
particularly
the
anadromous
fish
act,
and
subject
the
united
states
to
waiver
so
that
any
inappropriate
activity
cutting
off,
in
effect,
a
share
of
benefit
that
should
be
passed
to
idaho
in
the
upstream
dam
we
urge
can
be
attacked
in
the
courts
and
prevented
as
a
loss
to
idaho.
and
the
third
point
upon
which
we
suggest
the
master
was
not
correct
in
his
ruling
is
that
the
ocean
management
and
the
ocean
fishery
management
made
the
united
states
in
some
way
indispensable.
the
ocean
catch
occurs
exclusively
between
3
and
200
miles
under
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
commerce,
it
is
regulated.
idaho
sits
on
a
specific
regional
fishery
management
council
as
a
full
voting
member
along
with
oregon
and
washington.
and
neither
the
secretary
nor
the
council
has
any
authority
in
the
river
itself.
where
we
are
concerned
with,
only
after
river
entry
of
adults
and
only
as
to
those
adults
does
idaho
make
any
equitable
claim.
thus
the
ocean
fishery
and
the
ocean
regulation
may
again
affect
the
total
supply
available
but
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
allocation
of
the
adults
that
have
already
returned
to
the
river.
thus,
we
would
urge
that
an
adequate
judgment
can
be
had
and
the
united
states'
interests
are
not
so
linked
to
the
relief
sought
that
the
master's
conclusion
has
compelled.
in
addition,
we
would
urge
to
the
court
that
complexity
is
not
a
problem
in
this
case.
this
is
akin
and
actually
simpler
than
many
of
the
water
apportionment
cases
which
this
court
has
heard.
it
is
an
established
legal
proposition
of
this
court
in
original
jurisdiction
cases
where
efforts
to
settle
have
failed,
where
a
genuine
controversy
exists
and
where
the
gravity
and
importance
of
the
case
are
evident,
complexity
is
not
a
proper
justification
to
refuse
to
exercise
the
constitutional
function.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
our
first
prayer
for
relief
and,
in
addition,
we
would
say
there
are
procedural
devices
available
to
involve
the
united
states
as
amicus
or
that
in
any
event
the
case
ought
to
be
allowed
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
decree
sought
in
this
case
is
a
final
judicial
judgment
of
three
components.
number
one,
a
declaration
of
idaho's
entitlement
to
an
equitable
apportionment
in
certain
fish.
secondly,
an
establishment
of
an
approximate
percentage
based
on
scientific
evidence
of
each
species.
and
third,
the
projection
of
those
percentages
into
a
set
of
figures
and
structures
decreeing
basic
numbers
of
fish,
depending
on
size
of
the
run
under
two
conditions
-
poor
passage
where
many
of
the
fish
will
not
get
upstream,
and
under
good
passage
where
most
of
the
fish
in
relative
terms
will
get
upstream.
we
would
also
urge
the
court
that
continuing
jurisdiction
is
no
problem.
the
court
has
retained
its
jurisdiction
where
necessary
for
modifications
or
amendments
in
equitable
apportionment
cases.
but
this
court
has
avoided
involving
itself
in
active,
daily
supervision
and
nonjudicial
style
functions.
there
is
nothing
about
this
as
the
basic
apportionment
case
or
from
the
type
of
decree
sought
that
would
require
this
court's
active
daily
supervision.
in
fact,
as
i
have
suggested,
the
columbia
river
compact
exists
though
idaho
has
for
60
years
attempted
to
become
a
member
of
that
compact
unsuccessfully.
that
compact
has
to
this
day
and
does
now
serve
as
between
oregon
and
washington
the
source
of
expert
administration,
mutual
accommodation.
a
decision
by
this
court
establishing
idaho's
equitable
apportionment
will
for
the
first
time
in
those
60
years
remove
the
political
disincentives
of
oregon
and
washington
and
likely
a
three-member
compact
--
should
an
invitation
to
idaho
be
forthcoming
may
never
be
back
in
this
court
again
for
any
kind
of
administration.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
do,
and
it
is
in
that
spirit
of
frustration
and
for
that
simple
purpose,
because
there
is
no
mutual
accommodation
otherwise
available,
that
idaho
in
1975
filed
this
action.
in
conclusion
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
novel
and
important
case
regarding
a
precious
resource
of
migratory
fish
which
have
an
instinct
to
return
upstream
to
the
waters
of
their
adolescence
to
bear
young.
idaho
has
no
means
of
achieving
through
the
political
system
what
it
seeks
through
the
courts
in
this
matter.
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
apportion
fishery
in
the
columbia
river
and
asserts
none
and
need
not
be
a
full
party.
washington
and
oregon
alone
at
this
point
have
regulated
the
non-treaty
bound
anadromous
fishery
where
fish
are
coming
and
hope
to
come
to
idaho.
the
inequitable
results
of
the
defendant's
activity
in
regulating
and
managing
that
fishery
have
caused
idaho
to
seek
both
equity
and
justice
before
this
court
in
the
forum
provided
by
article
3,
clause
2,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
this
columbia
river
system
would
not,
though
it
flows
through
states,
including
montana
and
wyoming,
would
not
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
but
the
snake
to
the
wyoming
access
and
the
columbia
into
montana
are
blocked
by
dams
and
no
longer
available
for
anadromous
fish.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
the
answer
os
"no",
sir.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
the
pleading
alleges
that
we
produce
for
two
of
those
specific
runs
between
50
and
60
percent
of
the
fish
and
that
we
receive
back
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
percent.
as
i
suggested
and
as
the
master
has
heard,
some
of
the
merits
to
this
point
simply
because
of
the
interrelationship
of
federal
rights,
we
have
not
fully
explored
at
this
point
on
the
record
the
kinds
of
relief
and
the
kinds
of
numbers
that
idaho
would
seek
to
establish
by
expert
testimony.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
i
am
sorry;
would
you
restate
the
question?
mr.
david
h.
leroy
no,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
percent
that
return.
the
idaho
fishery
is
not
of
a
commercial
nature
and
in
no
way
as
in
the
case
in
oregon
and
washington,
takes
the
kinds
of
large
numbers.
we
have
sport
fishery
only
and
that
has
been
extremely
limited.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
to
my
knowledge
that
has
not
been
established
at
any
point
in
the
record
nor
has
it
subject
to
my
knowledge,
outside
the
record.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
what
we
are
seeking
in
this
matter
is
two
things.
first
of
all
and
foremost
of
all,
to
have
a
large
enough
escape
come
up
the
river
to
preserve
the
species.
and
second,
and
only
secondly,
a
reasonably
limited
sport
fishery
in
idaho.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
to
a
reasonably
limited
extent.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
the
runs
have
been
in
recent
years
depleted
despite
idaho's
best
efforts
to
attempt
an
allocation
in
a
number
of
fashions
to
preserve
the
run.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
they
are
affected,
yes,
by
what
goes
on.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
in
some
sense
that
is
the
case
which
we
face
at
this
time.
there
are
however
equities
of
apportionment
in
addition
to
that
escapement.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
emphasize
only
four
points.
first,
this
is
a
narrowly
drafted
pleading
focused
on
the
apportionment
sought.
as
the
adult
fish
reentering
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river,
for
the
first
time
at
that
point,
and
for
the
first
time
only,
do
they
become
subject
as
adults
to
fishery
in
the
columbia
river
and
for
the
first
time
they
are
subject
of
relatively
precise
calculation
in
number.
that
is
the
right
place
to
determine
the
equities.
therefore,
it
is
irrelevant
as
to
what
the
passage
losses
down
are
and,
picking
up
the
solicitor's
analogy,
it
is
also
irrelevant
what
the
losses
are
because
in
the
case
of
the
pie
the
actual
weight
and
the
actual
volume
of
the
pie
may
vary
because
of
the
size.
but
the
basic
equities
of
apportionment
as
between
those
three
partners
will
not
vary,
depending
on
the
size
of
the
pie.
secondly,
we
would
claim
only
as
to
upstream
fish
which
will
go
over
bonneville
dam
and
return
to
idaho.
the
master's
report
specifically
at
page
10
found
that
idaho
produces
many
fish
and
receives
few.
the
number
of
those
fish
that
go
to
idaho
and
the
number
by
the
same
token
that
stay
in
oregon
and
washington
are
subject
to
calculation
and
can
be
distributed
into
that
equitable
formula.
third,
indian
rights
are
not
affected
or
attacked
in
this
litigation.
idaho
seeks
distribution
only
from
the
oregon
and
washington
share.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
50-percent
indian
share.
washington
argues
that
idaho
should
perhaps
take
some
of
its
share
from
both.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor,
we
urge
that
it
is
so
possible
in
the
short
run.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
are
not
certain
on
the
merits,
once
we
hear
the
evidence
that
that
would
be
so,
your
honor.
but
in
any
event,
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes.
in
any
event,
should
the
court
so
conclude
a
part
of
that
equitable
apportionment
in
the
short
range,
a
part
of
that
additional
escapement
could
possibly
be
made
up
out
of
the
idaho-oregon-washington
share.
the
sohappy
litigation
in
the
state
of
oregon
adjudicated
not
just
the
indian
rights
as
against
oregon
and
washington
and
its
residents
but
as
against
all
non-indian,
non-treaty
persons
regardless
of
their
domicile.
thus
it
is
our
contention
that
the
idaho
share
should
properly
be
taken
out
of
the
oregon
and
washington
share
alone.
and
fourth,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
there
is
an
extremely
complex
set
of
figures.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
the
commercial
fishery
does
affect
these
three
runs.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
and,
in
addition,
the
record
will
show
that
there
is
substantial
sports
fishery
in
that
first
five
zones
coming
in
from
the
columbia
river
as
well
under
the
exclusive
regulation
of
oregon
and
washington.
so
we
would
urge
that
both
the
propositions,
sports
fishery
which
is
even
less
selective
in
some
respects
than
the
commercial
fishery
are
threats
to
idaho
and
threats
that
need
to
be
addressed
in
this
litigation.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
we
are
more
than
willing
to
explore
that
should
the
court
give
us
the
opportunity.
our
fourth
and
final
point
would
be
this,
that
the
wasted
philosophy
discussed
by
oregon,
the
sense
that
if
oregon
and
washington
let
them
go
by,
that
commercial
fishery
zone
some
will
die
and
some
will
not
go
to
idaho
and
therefore
they
are
wasted,
is
precisely
the
kind
of
short-term,
short-sighted
over-harvest
in
the
name
of
waste
that
brings
us
to
this
court.
gentlemen
of
the
court,
there
is
no
possibility
of
mutual
accommodation
on
that
basis.
there
is
no
possibility
of
mutual
accommodation
in
this
matter
without
a
judgment
of
this
court,
and
this
is
the
last
courthouse
and
the
last
courthouse
door.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
avoid
a
needless
and
unfortunate
technical
dismissal
in
this
original
jurisdictional
matter.
we
would
earnestly
petition
the
court
to
allow
this
case
to
proceed
to
the
merits
so
that
no
man
on
the
columbia
river
will
ever
say
that
his
net
has
caught
the
last
living
steelhead.
thank
you.
