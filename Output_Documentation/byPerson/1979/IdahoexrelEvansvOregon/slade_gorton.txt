mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
white,
you
are
of
course
correct
in
the
posture
of
this
case
as
it
appears
before
us.
now,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
indispensable
and
in
that
respect
basically
whether
or
not
a
decree
can
be
fashioned
which
is
fair
to
the
litigants
who
are
now
in
the
case
other
than
the
united
states,
which
of
course
is
not
in
the
case
itself.
the
factual
statements
about
this
however
is
not
in
the
same
posture
as
it
was
when
we
were
here
four
years
ago,
because
the
special
master
has
found
quite
precisely
a
set
of
facts
about
the
three
runs
which
are
the
subject
of
idaho's
complaint.
it
is
important
to
have
a
little
bit
more
in
the
way
of
factual
background
about
the
columbia
river
to
understand
those
three
runs.
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
except
if
the
united
states
had
come
in
would
the
special
master
have
gone
forward
with
this
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
you
are
going
to
argue
that
the
special
master
would
have
found
for
oregon
and
washington
or
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
on
the
merits.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
certainly
isn't.
and
there
isn't
that
now.
so
the
question
before
the
special
master
would
have
been
not
only
whether
or
not
there
is
a
remedy
but
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
in
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
i
do
not
wish
to
argue
that
question
because
it
is
not
before
you.
i
wish
to
argue
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
in
this
litigation
in
even
that
preliminary
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right,
much
less
a
remedy.
and
in
order
to
understand
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states
one
must
understand
something
at
least
about
the
way
in
which
anadromous
fish
operate,
both
going
downstream
on
the
columbia
river
and
upstream
on
the
columbia.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
course
he
would
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
to
that.
we
might
have
been
here
at
some
later
time
but
we
wouldn't
be
here
now.
we
are
here
because
we
don't
feel
that
justice
can
be
done
to
us
even
in
the
determination
of
a
right,
much
less
a
remedy,
whatever
that
determination
may
be,
in
the
absence
of
the
united
states;
and
that
for
a
very
good
and
sufficient
reason.
part
of
that
reason
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
are
many
runs
of
fish
in
the
columbia
river.
some
of
them
never
would
never
go
above
bonneville
dam
in
any
event
and
are
subject
to
a
major
oregon
and
washington
commercial
fishery.
some
which
go
above
the
bonneville
dam,
and
at
this
point
they
are
pretty
much
mixed
together,
aren't
going
up
the
snake
river.
they
go
up
the
mainstream
of
the
columbia
river
and
stay
in
the
state
of
washington,
would
never
leave
it,
leave
it
under
any
circumstances.
they
have
already
crossed
four
dams
by
the
time
they
get
to
the
confluence
of
the
snake
and
the
columbia.
and
some
of
course
continue
up
the
snake
at
which
point
they
would
eventually,
if
nothing
else
happened
to
them,
get
back
to
the
border
of
idaho
and
oregon
and
washington
and
go
on
up
to
some
other
point
higher
on
the
snake
river.
the
point
is
that
the
reason
that
these
fish
do
not
get
back
to
idaho
is
hardly
within
the
control
of
the
state
of
washington.
and
by
the
findings
of
this
special
master
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
for
all
practical
purposes
are
not
and
have
not
for
years
fished
on
those
runs.
now,
the
special
master
has
found
that
there
hasn't
been
a
summer
season
for
commercial
summer
chinook
--
one
of
these
three
things
--
since
1964.
you
need
a
lawsuit
over
summer
chinook?
we
just
haven't
been
fishing
them.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
if
you
will
give
me
a
moment,
mr.
justice
white,
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
and
this
is
an
element
of
it.
the
united
states
is
indispensable
for
summer
chinook
because
that
run
has
been
destroyed
or
almost
destroyed
not
by
any
action
of
the
state
of
washington
but
by
actions
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
slade
gorton
he
might
very
well.
and
if
he
does,
the
indians
certainly
ought
to
be
represented
in
the
litigation
in
which
he
comes
out
with
that
kind
of
judgment.
if
there
is
a
right
in
the
state
of
idaho,
if
there
is
a
right
at
all,
the
right
that
they
are
alleging
here,
that
right
can
only
come
out
of
fish
to
which
something
else
is
happening
at
the
present
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
one
would
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
right
would
come
relatively
equally
out
of
the
indian
and
non-indian
right.
normally,
idaho
would
have
sued
to
have
an
allocation
which
comes
out
of
the
entire
run
of
fish
coming
up
the
columbia
river.
now,
under
those
circumstances
obviously
the
united
states
would
be
indispensable.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
not
the
test
of
indispensability.
if
the
united
states
has
a
right,
it
represents
the
indians
and
has
a
right
to
be
in
the
case
and
chooses
to
exercise
its
sovereign
immunity
not
to
get
in
the
case,
there
can
be
no
decree.
but
so
what
idaho
has
done
is
to
say,
well,
the
united
states
really
isn't
indispensable
at
all
because
we
are
only
asking
a
decree
that
affects
oregon
and
washington's
non-indian
shares
of
this
resource.
that
is
the
way
that
they
attempt
to
avoid
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
but
under
the
agreement
which
oregon
and
washington
and
the
united
states
and
the
indians
have
made
in
this
case,
if
there
is
not
just
an
absolutely
fixed
percentage
allocation,
so
much
of
a
percentage
to
the
indians
and
so
much
a
percentage
to
the
non-indians,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
language
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
basis
of
that
agreement
in
one
sense
anticipates
your
decision
last
summer
in
u.s.
v.
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
don't
believe
that
it
binds
the
fifth
party,
which
is
not
a
party
to
it
at
all.
at
one
point
--
as
recently
as
last
summer
--
idaho
attempted
to
intervene
in
that
case
and
then
got
back
out
of
it.
we
intervened
in
the
case,
the
state
of
washington
did.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make,
because
it
is
the
only
point
in
front
of
you,
is
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
in
order
that
washington
and
oregon
as
well
as
idaho
get
justice
in
this
case.
if
a
decree
were
entered
that
said
that
idaho
has
the
right
to
an
allocation
and
the
right
to
that
allocation
can
be
enforced
only
against
oregon
and
washington,
no
justice
is
done
to
us
under
those
circumstances.
we
have
lost
the
fair
share
of
various
fishing
runs
which
we
agreed
with
the
united
states
in
other
litigation
--
in
u.s.
v.
oregon
--
that
we
were
entitled
to.
that
gives
us
the
right
to
go
back
into
the
district
court
in
oregon
and
say
under
the
terms
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
agreement
entered
in
u.s.
v.
oregon
was
that
each
party
is
entitled
to
a
fair
share
of
the
fish.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
that
fair
share
of
the
fish
assuming
the
particular
division
which
was
included
in
that
agreement
which,
incidentally,
included
in
it
exactly
the
escapement
which
idaho
asked
us
to
include
in
it
in
these
matters.
the
escapement
figures
in
that
agreement
were
submitted
effectively
to
us
by
idaho
as
long
ago
as
the
early
1970's
and
are
included
in
the
agreement.
but
based
on
that
fisheries
plan
we
entered
into
an
agreement,
we
in
oregon,
with
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes,
for
a
percentage
division
of
the
rest.
that
percentage
division
was
to
create
a
fair
share
which
turned
out
to
be
your
test,
u.s.
v.
washington.
if
a
portion
of
oregon
and
washington's
share
is
taken
away,
their
share
is
no
longer
fair
as
against
the
indians
themselves,
we
go
back
into
court,
ask
the
court
to
lower
the
indians'
share.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
would
not
because
the
definition
of
the
fair
share
entered
into
in
the
oregon
v.
washington
plan
was
based
on
certain
numbers,
reduced
percentages.
if
the
non-indian
share
is
reduced,
vis-a-vis
the
non-indian
share,
we
have
the
clear
right
under
that
plan
to
go
back
into
the
district
court
and
ask
that
the
indian
share
be
reduced
proportionately.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
plan
in
the
united
states
v.
oregon,
oregon
and
washington
have
agreed
to
a
particular
percentage
of
certain
runs
of
fish.
the
indians
get
a
certain
percentage.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
sum
of
those
two
percentages
equals
something
less
than
100,
because
there
is
in
addition
to
that
an
escapement
for
idaho,
the
escapement
which
idaho
asked.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
certainly
could
and
if
it
were,
it
would
reduce
the
indian
share
proportionately
with
the
non-indian
share,
which
is
the
reason
--
mr.
slade
gorton
but
that
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
phrasing
that
question
you
have
phrased
the
answer
as
to
why
the
united
states
is
indispensable
in
this
litigation.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
indispensable
to
us,
of
course.
it
is
indispensable
in
the
phraseology
of
indispensable
parties
now
in
order
to
prove
the
adequacy
of
the
judgment
in
the
absence
of
a
non-joined
party.
a
judgment
which
comes
out
against
the
state
of
washington
and
oregon
alone
and
which
does
not
affect
the
indians
is
certainly
not
adequate
as
to
washington
and
oregon.
we
must
have
washington,
we
must
have
the
united
states
in
this
same
proceeding
so
that
if
a
right
to
an
idaho
allocation
is
found
by
the
court,
that
right
can
be
adequately
and
with
justice
distributed
between
washington,
oregon
and
the
indians.
moreover,
the
adequacy
of
that
judgment
depends
on
what
the
united
states
does
to
allow
fish
to
get
into
the
columbia
river
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
in
its
ocean
fishery.
the
adequacy
of
that
judgment
also
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
united
states
can
be
required
in
the
operation
of
these
dams
to
allow
fish
to
get
up
to
idaho
in
any
event.
in
a
case
entitled
washington
v.
oregon
in
1936
this
court,
dealing
with
what
was
then
an
inequitable
claim
by
washington
to
water
going
down
the
walla
walla
river,
found
that
if
oregon
irrigators
were
cut
off
very
little
of
that
water
would
get
to
washington
anyway.
it
would
disappear
in
the
bed
of
the
river.
and
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
give
washington
a
small
amount
of
water
in
exchange
for
the
loss
of
a
great
amount
of
water
to
oregon.
the
facts
as
this
master
has
found
them,
the
effect
of
dams
managed
exclusively
by
the
united
states
means
that
an
allocation
of
washington
and
oregon
fish
to
idaho
would
take
a
huge
number
of
fish
out
of
the
washington
and
oregon
fisheries
and
produce
very
little.
by
the
findings
in
this
case
it
may
be
one
percent,
maybe
less
than
that.
but
in
order
to
see
to
it
that
idaho
has
either
a
right
or
can
enforce
that
right,
the
united
states
must
be
in
this
litigation.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party.
without
the
united
states
being
involved
in
the
determination
of
the
right
in
the
first
place,
idaho
can't
get
more
than
a
very
tiny
percentage
of
what
is
taken
away
from
us,
and
that
goes
to
the
existence
of
the
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
absolutely.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
idaho
has
no
commercial
fisheries.
washington
and
oregon
have
commercial
fisheries
but
they
do
not
have
commercial
fisheries
on
these
three
runs
except
for
a
very
--
an
extremely
short
one
on
one
of
the
spring
chinook
a
few
years
ago.
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon?
what
happens
to
these
runs
is
they
are
destroyed
--
to
the
extent
they
are
going
back
to
idaho,
they
are
destroyed
by
the
dams
of
the
snake
which
are
relatively
new
dams
and
which
are
run
by
the
united
states.
that
is
why
we
have
had
to
cut
off
our
fishery
in
the
lower
river.
before
those
dams
idaho
wasn't
here
because
we
allowed
plenty
of
fish
to
get
back
up
there.
we
weren't
here,
in
any
event.
but
oregon
--
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
idaho
has
also
asked
that
some
of
the
commercial
fishing
runs
on
washington-origin
fish
be
cut
off
or
be
restricted
because
there
is
an
incidental
part
of
some
of
some
of
these
runs
in
them.
the
runs
slightly
overlap.
they
would
have
us,
among
other
things,
maybe
lose
a
hundred
fish
so
that
one
fish
could
get
back
up
to
idaho
because
a
few
strays
from
one
of
these
runs
might
still
be
fit,
swimming
up
the
river
at
the
same
time
of
various
other
runs.
that
does
go
to
the
merits.
but
the
point
is
that
the
united
state
is
an
indispensable
party
because
in
the
state
of
this
case
with
only
the
states
in
it
and
not
the
united
states
which
controls
the
fisheries,
the
dams
and
of
course
is
trustee
for
the
indians,
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
judgment
of
a
right
or
a
remedy,
either,
which
will
do
justice
to
us.
we
will
simply
end
up
losing
all
kinds
of
fish
while
idaho
gains
nothing.
if
the
united
states
is
in
the
litigation
--
and
why
it
is
not
is
for
mr.
claiborne
to
tell
you
--
if
the
united
states
is
in
the
litigations,
then
any
decree
which
the
court
came
out
with
would
be
enforced
against
everyone
who
impacts
the
fishery.
and
we
might
very
well
claim
a
right
to
fish
in
the
ocean
which
you
are
returning
to
oregon
and
washington,
which
the
united
states
ignores
at
the
present
time.
we
would
be
happy
to
litigate
that
with
the
united
states.
we
can't
litigate
it
without
the
united
states
in
it.
therefore
we
can't
be
done
justice
in
this
case
without
the
united
states
in
the
case.
it
is
an
indispensable
party.
