mr.
james
a.
redden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
idaho
argues
essentially
that
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon
in
their
non-indian,
non-fee
commercial
fishery
in
the
lower
columbia
river
are
imperiling
the
fish
that
otherwise
and
should
otherwise
go
to
the
snake
river
in
the
state
of
oregon.
the
state
of
idaho
today
referred
to
the
sports
fishery
but
as
the
master's
report
finds
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
sports
fishery
has
any
real
impact.
it
is
in
terms
of
numbers
an
ineffective
fishery
on
the
columbia
river.
so
we
are
talking
essentially
about
the
commercial
fishery,
by
idaho's
own
argument,
not
the
indian
commercial
fishery
but
the
non-indian,
non-treaty
commercial
fishery
which
takes
place
in
one
area
in
the
entire
columbia
river
basin,
and
that
is
the
130
river-miles
between
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river
and
bonneville
dam,
the
first
of
the
eight
obstacles
between
the
ocean
and
the
eighth
dam
on
the
snake
river.
mr.
james
a.
redden
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
indians
do
not
fish
in
that
area.
mr.
james
a.
redden
that
is
correct,
although
there
is
litigation
now
with
the
yakimas
attempting
to
assert
their
rights
to
fish
in
the
lower
river,
but
that
is
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
they
have
no
such
rights
declared.
mr.
james
a.
redden
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles.
and
that
is
where
the
non-treaty
commercial
fishery
takes
place.
the
non-treaty
commercial
fishery,
that
fishery
is
not
a
fishery
upon
the
stocks
of
which
idaho
seeks
an
apportionment.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
fishery
in
the
lower
columbia
river
is
a
commercial
target
fishery
and
fish
which
are
destined
for
the
lower
columbia
river
and
tributaries
in
the
lower
columbia
river.
mr.
james
a.
redden
that
is
in
both
states,
in
oregon
and
washington.
and
we
share
seasons
and
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
james
a.
redden
yes,
it
is,
your
honor;
it
is
the
boundary
between
both
states.
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
because
by
the
nature
of
the
fish
itself
they
are
spawned
or
hatched
in
the
lower
columbia
river
and
that
is
the
area
to
which
they
return.
anadromous
fish
will
not
return
to
an
area
other
than
that
area
where
it
was
hatched.
these
fish,
which
our
commercial
fishermen
fish
in
the
lower
columbia
river,
were
hatched
or
spawned
in
the
lower
columbia
river
or
its
tributaries,
and
hence
do
not
seek
nor
would
they
be
able
to
know
how
to
go
across
bonneville
dam
or
the
other
dams.
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
brought
into
perspective
because
of
idaho's
argument
that
what
they
seek
is
a
reasonable
and
fair
and
equitable
apportionment
of
this
share
of
fish
which
are
not
destined
for
idaho's
waters
in
the
first
place.
mr.
james
a.
redden
the
special
master
in
his
report
does
point
out
that
the
non-treaty
commercial
fishery
is
limited
to
the
lower
columbia
river
and
that
the
indian
commercial
fishery,
a
substantial
and
significant
fishery,
is
in
that
area
above
bonneville
dam.
but
this
litigation,
as
the
master
points
out
deals
with
three
specific
runs
of
anadromous
fish
and
those
three
specific
runs
are
the
summer
chinook
salmon,
the
up-river
spring
chinook
salmon
and
the
summer
steelhead,
the
prime
game
fish.
idaho
claims
then
that
our
fishery,
our
rules
and
regulations
or
maintenance
of
that
fishery
is
such
that
they
are
done
out
of
their
fair
and
equitable
share.
on
summer
chinook
salmon,
there
has
not
been
a
non-treaty
commercial
fishery
on
summer
chinook
salmon
for
16
years,
none.
mr.
james
a.
redden
but,
your
honor,
the
contention
of
idaho
is
that
we
--
and
the
reason
we
are
here
before
this
court
is
that
idaho
is
claiming
that
we
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
that
they
have
a
right
to
fish,
that
we
are
over-fishing
and
destroying
in
the
lower
river.
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
your
honor,
in
the
complaint
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
idaho
it
is
these
three
runs
which
they
say,
to
which
they
claim
their
apportionment,
their
entitlement,
and
their
rights.
mr.
james
a.
redden
yes,
your
honor.
then
i
will
argue
or
urge
that
this
court
adopt
the
master's
report,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
united
states
is
indispensable,
a
term
used
by
this
court
this
year
in
the
1979
case
of
arizona
v.
california.
but
we
urge
the
united
states
is
indispensable
really
on
three
specific
grounds.
one
is
their
role
as
proprietor
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
actually,
i
think
they
are;
i
think
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
redden
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
your
honor,
if
the
united
states
is
not
an
indispensable
party,
which
is
the
term
used
by
the
master
in
this
case,
then
under
that
rule
they
are
necessary.
under
part
3,
where
it
says
that
a
party
is
in
fact
necessary
if
the
decree
in
order
to
be
adequate
must
bind
that
party.
mr.
james
a.
redden
but
we
cannot
see
how
a
decree
can
be
framed
in
any
way
to
be
adequate
in
terms
of
equity
and
good
conscience
without
that
decree
binding
the
united
states
as
its
role
as
proprietor
of
the
dams,
its
guardian
of
the
indians
or
its
sovereign
over
the
ocean
fishery.
there
is
simply
no
way,
and
the
master
as
a
matter
of
fact
does
allude
to
this
and
points
this
out
in
his
report.
although
he
first
says
that
because
idaho
does
not
claim
a
share
of
the
indian
fishery,
that
the
indians
do
not
be
parties,
the
master
does
in
his
arguments
and
comments
regarding
what
he
terms
indispensability,
does
refer
to
the
necessity
of
apportioning
a
share
of
the
indian
fishery
simply
in
order
to
keep
that
check.
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
decree
to
which
idaho
would
risk
being
entered
in
this
case
in
the
instance
of
the
dams
is
one
example,
if
it
did
not
bind
the
united
states
government
it
would
not
provide
an
additional
apportionment.
so
the
risk
they
are
willing
to
take
is
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
all
right.
if
we
take
an
example
of
100
anadromous
fish
which
are
in
fact
headed
for
the
upper
river.
and
let's
for
the
purpose
of
this
example,
let
us
say
that
there
is
no
fishery
--
commercial,
non-commercial,
indian,
sport
--
of
any
kind
on
those
100
fish,
only
85
of
those
fish
are
going
to
survive
bonneville
dam
on
the
way
up;
and
only
72
at
the
dalles
dam;
61,
john
day
dam;
52,
mcnary
dam
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
--
and
of
the
remaining
52,
20,
will
not
even
go
up
the
snake
river.
of
those
22
that
go
up
the
snake,
20
will
survive
vice
harbor;
17,
lower
monumental;
14,
little
bruce
dam;
and
12,
lower
granite
dam,
the
last
dam
on
the
snake
river.
mr.
james
a.
redden
but,
your
honor,
coming
back
down
the
figures
are
even
more
devastating
and
unless
the
court
can
enter
a
decree,
can
bind
the
united
states
on
its
control
of
the
dams,
whether
to
use
the
spillway
or
the
turbines,
whether
to
create
power
for
the
northwest
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
well,
your
honor,
if
the
desire
of
the
state
of
idaho
is
to
increase
or
enhance
the
release
of
smelt
in
the
snake
river
solely
because
that
will
automatically
in
some
fashion
result
in
an
increase
in
the
fishery,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
we
do
not
need
a
decree
of
this
court
to
provide
for
that.
what
we
need
is
cooperation
which
now
goes
on
between
the
federal
government
and
the
three
states.
the
federal
government
as
a
matter
of
fact
takes
a
majority
of
the
cost
of
the
plant.
mr.
james
a.
redden
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
history
of
the
interstate
compact
might
be
helpful
here.
the
state
of
oregon
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
pass
a
compact
bringing
idaho
into
that
compact
several
sessions
ago.
the
state
of
idaho
did
not
pass
it;
they
rejected
it
on
the
grounds
that
they
would
have
but
one
vote
of
three
and
that
if
they
did
not
have
a
super
vote
--
that
is
disproportionately
heavy
vote
--
their
participation
would
be
useless
because
there
would
be
one
sport
versus
two
commercial.
it
is
also
true
the
state
of
washington
did
not
pass
the
compact
in
that
year.
the
state
of
oregon
has
introduced
legislation
for
a
compact
in
subsequent
sessions.
this
lawsuit
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
i
do
not
think
a
combination
is
impossible,
your
honor;
and
i
don't
think
that
there
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
no,
your
honor,
it
is
possible
on
a
cooperative
basis.
and
we
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
been
working
with
the
state
of
idaho
and
the
state
of
washington
and
the
federal
government
on
this
matter.
mr.
james
a.
redden
idaho
did
not
agree
with
the
terms
of
the
compact
that
we
passed
the
last
time
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
washington
did
not
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
idaho
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
the
state
of
washington
did
not
pass
the
compact
bill
the
year
we
did
pass
it.
and
that
was
the
same
year
it
was
rejected
also
by
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
james
a.
redden
a
combination
is
possible
and
a
combination
is
occurring
in
the
agreement
in
the
united
states
v.
the
state
of
oregon
case,
incidentally,
in
which
idaho
petitioned
to
intervene
a
few
weeks
ago
on
a
limited
basis.
in
that
case
that
agreement,
which
is
part
of
this
record,
reflects
that
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
have
taken
into
consideration
--
prime
consideration
--
the
sports
fishery
and
escapement
into
the
snake
river
in
idaho.
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon
share
200
miles
of
the
snake
river
with
idaho
as
border.
the
fishermen,
sports
fishermen
in
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
fish
the
snake
river.
we
are
vitally
concerned
not
only
with
the
sports
fishery
for
our
sports
fishermen
and
idaho's
but
also
are
concerned
vitally
with
the
necessity
for
the
escapement
for
the
propagation
of
the
runs
of
anadromous
fish.
and
it
is
the
position
of
and
the
workings
of
both
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
to
enhance
and
increase
that
fishery,
and
it
has
been
for
many
years.
it
is
true
that
they
are
not
a
member
of
the
compact.
they
do
attend
the
compact
meeting.
under,
again,
the
plan
in
united
states
v.
oregon
our
order,
our
settlement
agreement
in
that
case
the
state
of
idaho
is
appointed
to
the
technical
advisory
commission.
the
three
states
are
represented
in
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
united
states
v.
oregon
which
is
the
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
that
is
the
district
court
for
oregon.
mr.
james
a.
redden
because,
your
honor,
the
fish
runs
upon
which
oregon
and
washington
fish,
those
runs
on
which
oregon--or
idaho
insists
that
oregon
and
washington
over-fish
are
runs
not
destined
to
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
james
a.
redden
i
think,
your
honor,
when
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
i
think,
your
honor,
when
this
matter
was
argued
before
the
state
of
the
record
was
such
that
would
necessarily
have
to
be
accepted.
i
think
that
the
state
of
the
record
today,
there
is
--
mr.
james
a.
redden
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
all
of
the
facts
and
information
that
i
provided
this
court
today
come
from
the
master's
report.
mr.
james
a.
redden
the
master's
report
does
speak
of
the
mortality
rate
of
the
fish
going
up
river.
it
does
speak
of
the
mortality
rate
coming
down
river.
it
does
speak
of
the
significance
of
the
indian
fishery
and
the
master
does
say
in
his
report,
express
the
opinion
that
an
adequate
apportionment
cannot
be
made
without
taking
into
consideration
the
indians.
because
as
the
share,
as
the
master
points
out
in
that
report,
the
fishery
of
the
indians
has
increased
from
39,000
pounds
in
1959
to
3
million
pounds.
mr.
james
a.
redden
yes,
your
honor,
from
the
master's
report;
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
james
a.
redden
according
to
his
report
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
redden
yes,
your
honor.
