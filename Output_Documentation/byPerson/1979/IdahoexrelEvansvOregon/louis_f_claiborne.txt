mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you
are
going
to
tell
us
at
some
point
why
the
united
states
isn't
in,
or
why
it
doesn't
want
to
be
in,
or
whether
it
does
want
to
be
in,
i
take
it?
at
least,
i
hope
you
will.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
will.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
texas
v.
new
mexico
involved
the
indispensability
of
the
united
states
in
its
role
as
trustee
for
indian
water
rights.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
that
result
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
was
based
on
the
report
of
the
special
master
which
had
been
reproduced
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
and
the
papers
now
before
the
court
to
indicate
precisely
because
one
couldn't
judge
it
from
the
single-line
per
curiam.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
arizona
v.
california
is
indeed
based
on
the
role
of
the
united
states
as
manager
of
the
water,
both
dams,
reclamation
projects.
and
i
believe
the
secretary
of
the
interior
dispensed
the
water
and
controlled
its
every
stage,
it
was
viewed
as
impossible
to
have
[illegible
words]
it
not
run
against
him
and,
indeed,
the
ultimate
decree
runs
entirely
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior
as
to
what
dispensations
of
water
it
shall
make,
indicates
the
present
effective
rights
to
the
respective
states
and
other
parties.
let
me
address
the
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice.
the
united
states,
as
the
court
is
no
doubt
aware
in
light
of
the
documents
published
by
idaho,
hesitated,
considered,
reconsidered
the
question
whether
it
should
hold
its
sovereign
immunity
as
a
bar
to
this
lawsuit,
feeling
some
sympathy
with
the
claim
of
idaho.
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
was
determined
that
the
united
states
ought
not
intervene
and
allow
the
proceeding
to
go
forward,
partly
because
it
was
our
judgment,
rightly
or
not,
that
the
opportunities
for
an
amicable
accommodation
of
this
lawsuit
had
not
been
exhausted.
the
four
years
that
have
passed
since
this
court
last
dealt
with
the
suit
have
unfortunately
not
been
occupied
in
very
useful
negotiations
between
the
states
and
the
united
states.
we
also
took
the
view,
perhaps
wrongly,
that
although
idaho
would
say
we
don't
want
to
disturb
the
indian
rights,
we
don't
want
to
disturb
the
operation
of
the
dams,
we
don't
want
to
in
any
way
control
the
management
of
the
ocean
fishery.
the
defendant
states
might
be
fully
entitled
to
say
those
methods
affect
what
may
be
a
fair
apportionment
of
the
resource
because
the
size
of
the
pie
has
much
to
do
with
how
you
fairly
divide
it.
and,
indeed,
the
plan
in
the
district
court
depends
on
the
size
of
the
pie
as
to
what
shares
go
to
the
indians,
what
share
goes
to
the
commercial
fisheries
in
washington
and
oregon,
and
what
share
escapes
to
idaho.
no
one
has
suggested
that
a
one-third,
one-third,
one-third
division,
no
matter
what
the
run,
is
appropriate.
it
does
depend
on
how
large
that
run
is
and
of
course
the
size
of
the
run
depends
on
the
operation
of
the
dams
and
depends
on
how
many
fish
are
allowed
into
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
white,
by
that
test
perhaps
no
party
would
ever
be
indispensable.
if
a
party
with
a
major
interest
in
the
resource
need
not
be
joined,
if
the
party
who
has
control
over
the
--
that
resource,
its
existence,
the
destruction,
is
not
a
necessary
party,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
case
in
which
a
party
is
indispensable.
idaho
is
perfectly
willing,
so
it
tells
the
court,
to
say,
we
will
assume
all
those
risks.
i
am
not
clear
that
oregon
and
washington
are
required
to
take
a
like
stance.
they
may
be
entitled
to
say,
if
we
are
going
to
deprive
ourselves
of
a
portion
of
the
fishery
we
presently
take,
the
indians
must
bear
a
part
of
the
burden.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
the
united
states
as
the
trustee
for
the
tribes,
all
the
tribes
themselves
must
be
a
party
to
defend
themselves
against
that
--
suggestions
from
the
defendant
states.
if
sovereign
immunity
has
any
continuing
force,
it
is
the
that
a
party
who
is
indispensable
and
who
is
sovereign
need
not
be
put
to
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
court
has
held
that
they
do
and
they
could
now
be
joined
in
this
lawsuit
and
could
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
question,
mr.
justice
white,
is
whether
that
manner
of
focus
which
idaho
insists
upon
is
binding
on
the
defendant
states.
now,
there
is
another
complication
in
this
case.
there
is
an
outstanding
decree
of
the
district
court.
in
my
judgment
if
one
looks
at
that
decree,
which
is
reproduced
at
the
back
of
idaho's
exceptions,
that
decree
cannot
survive
this
court's
taking
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
because
that
decree
provides
for
a
forum
which
is
premised
on
accepting
escapement
into
idaho.
if
that
is
disturbed,
the
premises
of
the
decree
are
undermined.
and
therefore
the
degree
to
which
there
is
a
settlement
between
the
tribes,
idaho
and
oregon
--
not
idaho,
washington
and
oregon
--
a
provision
however
adequate
or
inadequate
for
some
escapement
into
idaho
falls
apart.
and
that
it
seemed
to
us
was
a
major
consideration
in
not
inviting
a
new
lawsuit
putting
everything
open.
that
decree,
though
the
master
held
it
no
bar
to
this
proceeding,
no
doubt
correctly,
cannot
survive
this
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
entirely
agree
that
if
there
is
an
inequity
that
decree
cannot
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
my
only
counter
suggestion
is
that
that
lawsuit
in
which
all
the
parties
except
idaho
are
already
before
the
court
and
already
bound
to
some
extent
as
between
each
other
is
the
proper
forum
and
not
this
court
in
which
to
make
an
adjustment
in
favor
of
idaho.
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
have
been
toward
amending
the
decree.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
not
jurisdictionally,
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
suggesting
that
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
appreciate
that.
but
if
the
door
to
this
court
is
closed
or
half
closed,
idaho
may
be,
and
the
defendant
states
because
it
is
only
half
closed,
may
be
more
inclined
to
sit
down
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
--
what
we
have,
in
effect,
said
is
that
if
idaho
finds
the
door
of
all
courthouses
closed
after
making
a
bona
fide
effort
to
seek
an
accommodate
settlement
in
this
matter,
the
united
states
will
not
indefinitely
continue
to
block
the
lawsuit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
united
states
and
the
tribes,
both
of
whom
are
independent
parties
in
the
district
court
--
i
can't
speak
for
the
tribes
because
some
of
them
have
indicated
their
unwillingness
to
change
the
allocation
to
them
--
the
united
states
has
indicated
that
in
its
view
there
is
an
appropriate
adjustment
to
be
made
to
the
benefit
of
idaho.
and
that
position
could
lead
either
to
consenting
to
the
suit
in
this
court
or,
what
seems
to
us,
that
in
the
district
court
case
with
a
judgment
already
entered
a
possibility
of
amending
it
there
and
more
appropriate
supervision
of
all
the
adjustments
that
are
required.
in
that
district
court
litigation,
it
is
the
proper
forum.
we
are
not
intent
on
depriving
idaho
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
if
idaho
were
party
by
agreement,
just
as
washington
and
oregon
are
only
both
before
the
same
district
court
because
they
agreed
on
a
judgment.
idaho
could
likewise
agree
on
a
judgment
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
would
not
therefore
be
asked.
