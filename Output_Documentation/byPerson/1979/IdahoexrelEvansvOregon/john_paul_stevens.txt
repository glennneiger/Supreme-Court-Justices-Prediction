justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
question,
attorney
general
gorton,
as
to
whether
oregon
and
washington
really
were
entitled
to
all
those
non-treaty
fish.
they
certainly
had
a
right
superior
to
the
indians
as
to
--
let's
take
it
as
half.
maybe
that
isn't
fair.
i
understand
you
were
going
to
explain
that
and
didn't
quite
get
to
it.
but
say
that
the
non-treaty
fishermen
have
a
right
to
half
of
the
fish
and
you,
in
effect,
have
got
a
decree
that
says
we
can
take
half
of
the
fish.
but
some
of
those
fish
maybe
belong
to
idaho,
the
non-treaty
fishermen
in
idaho.
and
do
you
have
a
right
to
preempt
their
access
to
those
fish?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
a
moment
right
there.
assume
that
a
portion
of
the
share
now
going
to
oregon
and
washington
was
reduced
and
assume
there
were
means
to
insure
that
that
would
arrive
in
idaho.
it
would
still
be
fair
then,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
do
have
a
remedy
in
the
event.
i
don't
understand
it.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
the
other
side
of
the
case
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
the
sum
of
those
two
percentages
equal
100?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
supposing
that
the
master
tried
this
case
and
decided
that
that
percentage
escapement
for
idaho
should
be
different.
couldn't
the
decree
in
washington
be
modified
to
take
into
account
that
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
won't
be
heard
until
that
happens.
they
will
not
be
heard
until
that
happens
and
they
would
be
represented
in
the
proceeding
in
which
that
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
this
can't
proceed
in
two
stages.
if
the
master
says
instead
of
an
escapement
of
20
percent
or
it
should
be
25
percent,
that
reduces
the
amount
available.
and
in
this
proceeding
that
cuts
back
on
washington
and
oregon
and
now
it
is
up
to
washington
and
oregon
to
file
an
appropriate
motion
in
the
court
in
the
other
case
and
get
relief
against
the
indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
whom
is
it
indispensable,
that
is
what
i
don't
understand.
you
say
it
is
indispensable
to
you.
but
the
only
reason
it
is
indispensable
to
you
is
you
may
need
their
help
in
cutting
back
on
the
indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
attorney
general
gorton,
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
is
your
colleague
attorney
general
redden
correct
in
saying
that
the
only
three
runs
are
the
three
that
he
has
identified,
two
salmon
runs
and
one
steelhead
run?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
this
case,
no
matter
how
it
is
decided,
won't
affect
the
commercial
fisheries
in
washington
and
oregon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
there
were
--
he
said
there
were
no
commercial
fisheries
involved.
maybe
that
is
just
in
oregon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
on
that
argument
assume
there
is
an
inequity
in
the
escapement
figure
we
have
now.
should
that
decree
survive,
then?
if
the
premise
of
the
whole
lawsuit
is
that
the
escapement
figure
is
inequitable,
your
argument
of
inequity
is
there
is
something
magic
about
preserving
an
inequity,
as
i
understand
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
master
is
capable
of
determining
in
this
proceeding
whether
or
not
there
is
an
inequity,
why
should
not
this
case
go
forward
to
answer
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
are
these
three
runs
reduced
by
the
commercial
or
sports
fishery
below
bonneville?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
that
the
commercial
fishery
doesn't
affect
these
three
runs.
at
least
that
is
not
the
major
focus
of
the
commercial
fishery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
else
are
the
runs
affected
by
fishing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
it
may
turn
out
that
washington
and
oregon,
either
commercially
or
sportswise,
aren't
really
affecting
your
three
runs
substantially?
