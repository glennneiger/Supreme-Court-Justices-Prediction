justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leroy,
the
term
has
been
used
"indispensable
party,"
and
as
i
read
the
1966
amendments
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
term
is
not
used
in
those
rules.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
suggests
a
somewhat
laxer
standard,
doesn't
it,
than
the
old
indispensable
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
united
states
refuses
to
join,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
on
to
that,
supposing
before
the
passage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
1946
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
had
been
sued
in
a
district
court
for
a
tort
incurred
by
the
act
which
later
would
have
been
covered
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
he
simply
asserts
sovereign
immunity.
he
said
whether
we
were
negligent,
grossly
negligent
or
reckless,
you
can't
sue
the
united
states
because
congress
has
not
given
its
consent.
are
you
suggesting
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
could
be
reviewed
by
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
court
could
tell
the
united
states
even
though
the
united
states
had
said,
we
will
not
waive
our
sovereign
immunity,
a
court
could
say,
yes,
you
must
waive
your
sovereign
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leroy,
judge
breitenstein
has
used
the
term
"indispensable
party,"
and
i
think
you
responded
to
an
earlier
question
of
mine
since
the
amendment
of
'66
that
term
is
no
longer
used
in
the
rules.
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
your
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reasonable
availability,
basically.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
there
couldn't.
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
i
mean
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
question
to
be
discussed
in
a
motion
here,
i
wouldn't
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
the
nine
members
of
this
court
sufficiently
expert
in
the
habits
of
anadromous
fish
to
know
whether
or
not
these
particular
fish
you
are
talking
about
would
or
would
not
return
to
idaho
or
go
back
to
idaho?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
may
well
be
right
on
that.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
even
in
pre-1966
terminology
there
was
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
a
necessary
party
and
a
indispensable
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
neither
washington
nor
idaho
agrees
with
the
terms
that
you
want?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
washington
didn't
agree
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
same
thing
as
to
pointing
to
a
particular
factual
finding
in
the
master's
report
as
requested
by
justice
stevens
that
squarely
hits
the
nail
on
the
head.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
white's
question
is
wholly
irrelevant
in
the
sense
that
if
the
united
states
had
not
raised
an
objection
as
being
an
indispensable
party,
the
master
would
have
gone
ahead
and
tried
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
special
master
could
come
out
differently
with
respect
to
indian
rights
than
some
of
the
previous
decisions
since
1964.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
united
states
can
sue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
united
states
doesn't
like
what
it
gets,
it
can
sue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
that
agreement
between
four
parties
bind
a
fifth
party
who
is
not
a
party
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
idaho
wasn't
a
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
like
to
hear,
mr.
claiborne,
any
additional
authorities
you
have
to
cite
in
addition
to
those
of
your
memorandum
of
april
26,
1979
that
indicate
why
the
united
states
as
trustee
for
the
indians
is
an
indispensable
party.
the
cases
you
cited
simply
show
the
united
states
as
operators
of
reclamation
projects,
and
so
forth,
are
indispensable
parties.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
texas
v.
new
mexico
was
a
one-paragraph
per
curiam
decided
february
25,
1957
no
purported
reasoning
whatever,
simply
a
statement
of
a
result.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
be
the
matter
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
indian
tribes
don't
have
sovereign
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
likewise
if
the
--
if
idaho
finds
the
door
of
this
court
open,
the
indians
and
the
united
states
may
be
a
lot
more
tractable
about
their
reaction
to
the
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
about
the
suit
in
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
state
of
idaho
original
case,
the
state
of
idaho
has
invoked
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
in
a
suit
against
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
idaho
seeks
equitable
apportionment
of
various
runs
of
anadromous
fish
migrating
from
the
pacific
ocean
to
idaho
by
way
of
the
columbia
and
snake
river.
according
to
idaho
fishermen
in
oregon
and
washington
which
are
located
downstream
from
idaho
are
taking
more
than
their
fair
share
of
fish
that
would
otherwise
return
to
idaho
to
spawn.
we
referred
the
case
to
a
special
master
who
has
recommended
that
idaho's
complaint
be
dismissed
because
the
united
states
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit.
the
special
master
believes
that
the
united
states
was
a
necessary
party
because
it
regulated
fishing
in
the
pacific
ocean.
because
it
controlled
the
dams
over
which
the
migrating
fish
must
pass
on
their
way
to
idaho
and
because
it
acts
as
trustee
for
various
tribes
of
indians
who
also
are
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
fish.
contrary
to
the
special
master's
recommendation,
we
hold
that
this
suit
can
proceed
even
if
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
neither
the
government's
regulation
of
the
ocean
fishery
not
its
control
of
the
dams
would
prevent
this
court
from
allocating
to
idaho
a
portion
of
those
fish
now
being
taken
by
non-indian
fishermen
in
oregon
and
washington.
nor
would
the
indian's
right
to
take
fish
necessarily
affect
or
be
affected
by
the
narrowly
drawn
decrees
sought
by
idaho.
we
therefore
sustain
idaho's
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report
and
remand
the
case
to
him
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
dissent.
