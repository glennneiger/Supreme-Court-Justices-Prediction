mr.
marc
l.
parris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
there
are
two
essential
questions
before
this
court.
first,
whether
sponsorship
alone
infringes
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
respondents
and
secondly,
whether
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
this
country
to
virtually
end
the
patronage
system.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
full
time
teachers,
janitors
or
deputy
sheriffs
whose
only
income
is
their
government
job
which
they
have
more
than
some
expectancy
of
continuation,
but
rather
before
this
court,
come
the
respondents,
attorneys
with
private
practices.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
was
just
talking
in
the
point
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
my
county
especially,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
i
will
--
if
you
want
me
to
espouse
in
that,
there
is
politics
even
in
civil
service.
since
the
department
head
can
pick
from
the
top
three,
and
he
could
find
his
friend
even
sixth
or
seventh,
if
he
wait
until
the
exam
comes
out
or
when
the
examine
is
published,
some
of
the
top
people
have
already
received
positions,
and
you
can
work
it
up.
so
there
is
politics
in
civil
service
as
well.
rockland
county
actually
has
a
very
good
record
in
civil
service.
in
fact,
out
of
2000
employees,
there
are
mere
50
approximately.
they
are
in
this
exempt
patronage
situation
of
which
34
attorneys.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
they
have
no
opted
to
do
that.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
or
assisting
county
attorneys
or
assistant
district
attorneys.
they
have
found
it's
worked
better
and
be
more
responsive
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
understand
that.
we
will
argue
that
there
was
no
compelling
--
we
don't
have
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
because,
in
fact,
we
see
no
denial
of
any
constitutional
right
in
this
case.
unlike
elrod,
there
was
no
coercion
here.
no
one
asked
the
respondents
to
leave
the
republican
party,
to
contribute
to
the
democratic
party,
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
democratic
party.
in
fact,
they
were
simply
ignored,
not
rehired,
and
i
cannot
see
where
that
is
a
denial
of
their
right
for
freedom
of
association.
they
do
also
make
a
claim
of
some
sort
of
an
expectancy.
however,
i
do
not
see
any
objective
expectancy
equaling
any
property
right
or
any
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
served
at
the
pleasure
of
the
appointing
authority,
that
was
their
public
defender,
mr.
barone,
the
prior.
if
you
can
envision
that
the
public
defender
is
the
hand
and
the
assistants
are
the
fingers,
when
the
hand
goes
so
do
the
fingers.
now,
on
december
31st,
1977
at
12
midnight,
mr.
barone's
term
was
over,
he
was
being
replaced.by
law,
they
also
terminated.
january
1st,
when
my
client
mr.
branti
became
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
into
the
civil
service
interpretation
of
the
law
by
our
personnel
director
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
138
and
139
in
the
appendix,
where
this
discussion
takes
place
and
which
he
states
quite
clearly
that
they
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
appointing
authority.
and
when
the
appointing
authority
is
no
longer
there,
their
term
ends
when
his
term
ends.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
very
germane.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
would
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i'd
like
to
elaborate
on
both
these
points,
sir.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
the
first
one
is
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
which
like
we
stopped
now.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
okay,
thank
you.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
thank
you.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions
as
to
the
termination
notice
referred
to
in
6a,
that
is
actually
a
purely
ministerial
pro
forma
act
in
order
to
indicate
to
the
various
county
departments
such
as
the
treasurer
and
personnel
that
determination
has
taken
place.
otherwise,
you'd
have
people
continued
on
the
pensions
and
payroll.
it's
really
a
bookkeeping
type
of
a
thing.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
part
time.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
best
example
can
be
myself,
because
i'm
the
county
attorney
of
rockland
county.
i
have
similar
employees
in
the
exempt
class,
attorneys,
assistant
county
attorneys.
i
hope
to
be
reappointed
next
month.
i
will
be
then
retaining
these
employees
who
will
then
have
to
go
and
swear
an
oath.
if
they
had
some
sort
of
a
continuation,
why
would
they
have
to
swear
their
oath
again
next
month
after
i
retain
them?
it's
because
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
they
serve
at
my
pleasure.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
if
i
reappointment
them.
then
they
have
to
go
and
swear
an
oath.
now,
why
would
they
have
to
do
that?
mr.
marc
l.
parris
they
serve
at
my
pleasure.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
excuse
me.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
the
law
does.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
your
honor.
of
course,
there
is
no
statute.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
it's
through
the
civil
service
department
of
the
state
of
new
york,
interpreted
by
our
personnel
director.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
as
he
states
in
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
page
138.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
the
appendix
toward
the
bottom.
the
question,
“is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
permanent
appointment
of
an
exempt
man
so
that
he
can
remain
in
office
and
succeed
as
appointing
authority?”
answer,
“no,
sir.”
question,
“when
individual
is
appointed
to
an
exempt
position,
he's
required
to
take
an
oath
of
office,
is
he
not?”
answer,
“all
employees
are
required
to
take
an
oath
of
office
including
those
appointed
to
the
exempt
class
position
--
position.”
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
i
would
refer
also
--
you
had
asked
the
--
the
question
as
to
judge
broderick
on
25a.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
and
above
he
--
he
does
state
the
third
and
final
requirement
of
the
elrod
concurrence
that
the
attempt
to
remove
plaintiffs
from
their
jobs
have
been
based
upon
--
on
the
sole
ground
of
their
political
beliefs.
but
down
about
six
lines
from
the
--
the
bottom
of
that
same
page,
he
writes,
“the
incident
was
not
a
ground
for
defendant's
decision
not
to
renew
plaintiff,
finkel.”
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
it's
by
civil
service
law.
they
announced
serving
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
for
a
new
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
it
may
have,
but
they
wouldn't
have
continued
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
they
may
not
--
they
--
they
could
have
by
error
because
the
ministerial
act
wasn't
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
didn't
take
place.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
basically,
i
know
that
because
the
fact
that
i'm
the
county
attorney
and
i'm
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
i'm
involved
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
it's
an
involvement
that
i
know
because
i
handled
these
matters.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
right.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
your
honor,
because
they
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
an
appointing
authority.
that
is
stated
in
mr.
anderson,
uncontroverted
testimony.
if
the
person
is
gone
and
you're
serving
that
person
and
his
term
ends,
they
also
self-destruct.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that
was
an
error.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
maybe
there
was
an
error
on
the
part
of
judge
broderick.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
the
court
to
take
notice
of
judge
hall's
concurrence
in
(inaudible)
because
he
made
a
point
to
that,
that
this
--
it's
not
a
termination.
there's
a
difference
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
someone
you're
not
rehiring.
for
instance,
to
really
--
it
comes
down
to
--
that
i
think
is
that
sponsorship
to
--
to
nine
vacant
positions,
absence
the
coercion
in
elrod,
leaves
me
to
believe
that
you
couldn't
violate
anyone's
constitutional
right.
where
is
the
--
this
right
of
liberty?
does
it
extend
to
someone
who
has
another
job
and
who
is
just
not
rehired?
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
yes,
but
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes.
i
would
also
like
to
return
if
i
may
to
the
question
of
expectancy.
we
have
the
case
here
where
one
of
the
respondents,
mr.
finkel,
changes
registration
to
a
democrat,
several
months
prior
to
january
1978.
that
doesn't
sound
like
someone
who
has
the
expectancy,
an
objective
expectancy
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
of
returning.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
excuse
me.
it
didn't
work.
yes,
your
honor,
obviously.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
i
plan
to,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
like
imperatives.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
it
may
in
that
case,
but
that's
not
what
happened
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
here.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no
it
was
in
elrod
rule.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
as
to
which
issue
that
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
think,
it
made
it
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
right.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
think
if
the
court
wanted
to
extend
it
to
that.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
it
might.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
and
one
--
one
very
important
point
here,
we
talk
about
solely
for
political
reasons.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
were
two
democrats
in
that
whole
--
an
office
which
who
were
not
rehired.
one
of
the
people
that
was
--
were
rehired
is
a
registered
blank.
and
--
and
in
fact,
the
record
also
shows
that
my
client
had
spoken
to
a
republican
legislator
about
--
he
was
very
interest
in
law
secretary
--
republican
law
secretary.
and
legislator
(inaudible),
a
republican,
stated,
“i'm
not
interested
in
him,
he
has
a
job.
i
want
to
find
a
job
for
tabakman.
so
there
was,
i
think,
no
denial
of
political
beliefs
in
the
sense
of
they're
being
republicans.
what
you
had
was
as
i
see
it,
nine
vacant
positions,
280
some
odd
attorneys
in
rockland
county,
all
with
a
possibility,
if
they
could
qualify
as
criminal
attorneys.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
the
legislature
of
rockland
county.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
sir.
they
could
change
it
to
full
time
and
again,
they
do
control
that.
it's
the
power
of
the
person.
they
could
have
three
assistants
or
nine
assistants,
it's
the
local
legislature.
now,
as
we
stated
before,
we
don't
believe
we
have
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest,
because
we
don't
believe
that
any
constitutional
right
was
lost.
in
fact
however,
we
believe
we
have
shown
a
compelling
state
interest
in
that
attorneys
are
special.
i
think
this
court
recognized
that
attorneys
were
special
in
bates
versus
the
state
bar
of
arizona.
they're
special
in
our
civic,
cultural
and
political
life.
i
would
like
the
court
to
envision
a
political
ladder,
right
here.
at
the
bottom
rung,
our
assistant
county
attorneys,
assistant
public
defenders,
assistant
attorney
generals.
up
atop,
the
u.s.
congressman,
u.s.
senators,
governors,
and
of
course,
judges.
and
i
think
this
court
will
recognize
that
attorneys
do
have
a
higher
proportionate
share
than
other
occupations
and
professions
as
to
these
high
and
lofty
positions.
what
i'm
saying
is
if
you
affirm
the
local
court
decisions,
you
will
effectively
set
up
an
entry
barrier,
the
young,
intelligent,
ambitious
male
and
female,
black
and
white
attorneys
from
starting
on
that
ladder
and
moving
up
to
those
lofty
positions.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
your
honor,
because
below
we
believe
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
that
was
lost
and
we
didn't
have
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest.
but
i
think
it's
an
important
interest.
i
think
that
myself
--
and
this
is
really
why
i'm
here,
because
i
do
believe
in
a
patronage
system,
our
patronage
system
in
rockland
county,
a
moderate
one.
and
i'm
an
example
of
it,
so
is
my
co-counsel,
mr.
apotheker.
i
start
--
in
1974,
the
democrats
took
over
the
legislature
in
rockland
county,
the
majority.
and
i
was
appointed
assistant
county
attorney.
from
there,
i
moved
to
first
deputy
county
attorney.
two
years
ago,
i
became
county
attorney.
leaders
have
spoken
to
me
recently
about
running
me
for
state
office
and
possibly
a
county
court
judgeship.
mr.
apotheker
was
just
recently
elected
to
a
town
justice
seat
in
haverstraw.
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
in
the
ladder.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
ladder
to
the
rich
who
don't
need
the
political
machinery.
they
don't
need
the
party
strength
to
move
up
that
ladder.
they
can
skip
all
the
rungs.
they
can
go
straight
with
their
money
and
run
for
u.s.
senator
or
congressman.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
absolutely.
i
believe
in
the
two-party
system
and
i
believe
that
both
parties
in
rockland
county,
democrats
and
republicans,
just
would
be
able
to
attract
these
intelligent,
young
and
yes,
ambitious
attorneys
to
move
up
this
ladder.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
maybe,
your
honor,
but
something
i
wanted
to
say
to
this
court
because
i
deeply
believe
it.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
i
say
through
that
party
system,
but
attorneys
generally
as
they
come
out
of
the
law
school
to
a
great
extent,
most
of
them
do
get
involved
in
politics.
that's
why
they're
different
than
deputy
sheriffs
and
janitors
and
we
recognize
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
that
in
bates.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
he'd
still
have
a
right
to
run,
but
runs
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
[laughs]
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
party
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
well,
in
the
constitution,
but
it
--
it's
a
--
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
importance
of
the
two-party
system.
it
has
been
for
the
past
200
years.
recommendations
of
patronage,
whatever
you
want,
isn't
all
about
public
and
our
private
lives,
everyone
recommends
someone
for
something.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that
is
quite
often.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes,
i
--
but
i
believe
this
court
should
be
following
as
i
said
before,
the
reasoning
and
especially
judge
hall's
concurrence
because
there,
i
think
there's
a
tremendous
resemblance
between
(inaudible)
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
--
and
this
case.
in
both
cases,
you
don't
have
the
coercion
of
elrod.
and
in
both
cases,
you
have
terms
that
came
to
an
end.
yes,
in
(inaudible)
was
by
statute.
but
it
was
and
also
the
question
of
--
in
(inaudible)
of
a
small
office
looking
for
loyalty
as
opposed
to
the
deputy
sheriff
--
sheriff's
office
in
cook
county
which
was
3000
or
4000
employees.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
it's
30
miles
north
in
new
york
city
--
northwest
of
new
york
city.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
it's
--
it's
across
the
tappan
zee
bridge
from
westchester
county
and
right
above
new
jersey.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
correct,
from
westchester.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
exactly,
exactly.
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
public
defender
and
his
assistants
and
as
to
whether
a
public
--
a
public
defender
is
in
fact
a
policymaker,
i've
a
great
deal
of
problem
because
i
really
--
from
the
time
i
read
elrod,
i've
been
troubled
by
what
this
court
meant
by
policymaking
confidential.
i
think
that
the
lower
court
decisions,
legal
periodicals
are
all
in
the
same
position.
possibly
harvard
law
review
is
closest
when
they
said
janitors
and
elevator
operators
definitely
not
--
are
not,
department
heads
probably
are,
and
everyone
between
would
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
by
the
court.
i
think
that
--
one
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
assistants
are
the
alter
ego.
they
are
the
extension
of
the
public
defender.
they
are
and
these
--
just
23
justice
courts
around
the
county
and
they
are
the
public
defender
when
they
walk
into
those
courts.
so
there
is
an
extension
there.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
we
assume
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
oh,
i
remember
that.
that
was
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
(inaudible)
yes.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
correct.
and
recommend
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
no,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
yes.
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is.
and
as
--
and
assistant
public
defenders
really
live
within
the
term
of
their
appointing
authority.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
don't
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
in
the
case
of
the
assistant
public
defenders
or
assistance
county
attorneys,
sir?
mr.
marc
l.
parris
oh,
just
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
oh,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
as
--
as
i
was
stating
that
i
had
this
problem
about
the
public
defender,
but
i
would
like
to
give
this
example
possibly
because
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
public
defender
is
a
policy
holder
or
who
is
the
policy
holder.
is
it
just
the
legislator
and
his
confidential
secretary?
is
it
a
judge
and
his
law
secretary
and
then
what
about
the
others
in
an
office?
i
thought
about
this
and
i
took
the
example
of
the
possibility
of
a
public
defender
stating,
“we'll
have
no
more
pleas
on
marijuana
cases."
and
he
gives
that
to
his
assistant
public
defenders.
and
they
go
into
the
courts
to
implement
that
policy.
but
he's
the
one
up
in
front.
he's
the
one
in
the
courts.
he
sees
the
witnesses
and
judges
the
jury.
and
when
he
comes
back
and
they
discuss
it
in
the
public
defender's
office
and
he
states
that,
“on
this
case
chief,
we
must
take
a
plea.
i've
seen
that
witness.
i've
seen
that
judge.
you
--
this
one,
we're
going
to
change
your
policy.”
are
they
not
in
a
confidential
relationship
within
the
making,
the
implementing
and
the
changing
of
a
policy?
i'll
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
to
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marc
l.
parris
i
make
--
i
make
two
quick
points.
i
don't
want
to
leave
this
court
that
--
this
court's
be
left
with
the
impression
that
democrats
in
rockland
county
don't
rehire
republicans
to
of
the
leading
people
in
the
county,
mr.
george
ranker
(ph)
who
is
director
of
our
order
to
control
is
a
republican.
usually
--
mr.
marc
l.
parris
some
they
don't
[laughs],
right.
but
we
have
quite
a
few
at
the
annex
to
want
to
leave
that
impression
and
i
would
just
leave
the
court
with
--
as
to
the
question
of
continuation
of
employment
which
i
think
is
paramount
as
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
“it
stretches
the
concept
too
far
to
suggest
that
a
person
is
deprived
of
liberty
when
he
simply
is
not
rehired
in
one
job
but
remains
as
free
as
before
to
seek
another.”
thank
you.
