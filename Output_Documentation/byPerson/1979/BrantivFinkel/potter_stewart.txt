justice
potter
stewart
that
to
me,
is
a
very,
very
important
issue
as
you
might
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
get
to
say
my
concurrency
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
elrod
and
the
district
court
talks
about
--
i'm
talking
about
6a
of
the
appendix
to
your
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
talks
about
--
he
says
on
that
date,
that
is
soon
after
his
appointment,
the
public
defender,
began
the
process
of
executing
termination
notices
for
six
of
the
nine
assistants
who
had
served
under
barone,
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
were
being
discharged.
that's
what
termination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
knows
--
notice
means.
but
then
later,
the
district
court
says
and
i
just
--
for
example,
look
at
page
25a
of
the
appendix
to
this
certiorari
petition,
subsection
(c)
of
the
opinion,
“plaintiffs
were
not
reappointed
solely
because
of
their
political
beliefs.”
well,
to
me,
that's
a
very,
very
important
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe
over
--
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
lunch
break,
you
can
--
you
--
thinking
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
ready.
i
don't
know,
but
i
didn't
want
you
to
necessarily
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
answer
it
now.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
is
--
is
your
--
you
--
you
tell
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
of
law
that
these
people's
employment
automatically
expired
subjected
to
only
to
this
ministerial
certification
of
that
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
that
the
--
that
--
that
the
public
defender
himself,
left
office.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
you'll
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you'll
reappointment
them,
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
district
court
have
to
say
on
this
subject,
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
then
his
--
his
caption
for
that
section
of
his
opinion
is
"plaintiffs
were
not
reappointed."
but
is
there
any
--
beyond
that,
is
there
any
--
are
there
any
findings
of
the
district
court
in
which
you
remember
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
elrod
judgment
was
--
was
supported
by
five
members
of
this
court.
three
joined
in
one
opinion
and
which
is
--
i'd
call
them
correctly,
the
plurality
opinion
and
two
joined
the
judgment
based
upon
another
considerably
shorter
opinion.
and
that
second
opinion
joined
the
judgment
only
on
the
basis
of
the
proposition
that
an
employee
cannot
be
discharged
or
threatened
with
a
discharge
from
a
job
that
he
is
satisfactorily
performing
upon
the
sole
ground
of
his
political
beliefs.
and
if
there
is
no
discharge
here,
then
as
you
say,
you'd
have
to
extend
out
if
it's
not
covered
by
elrod
and
--
and
elrod
would
have
to
be
extended
to
cover
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
rockland
county?
justice

where

justice

u.s.--
justice

stewart
--
u.s.
attorneys
there,
does
their
term
expire
when
a
new
president
is
inaugurated?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
were
some
a
little
brouhaha,
but
in
philadelphia
not
so
long
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
new
york
earlier,
but
--
but
generally,
they
--
there
is
a
change,
isn't
there
and
isn't
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they're
appointees
of
the
executives
or
the
justice
department
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
know
if
their
term
expires.
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
they
do
some
settling.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
very
page
of
the
record
to
which
you
referred
us
indicates
of
the
awareness
of
the
witness
that
he
could
be
dismissed
without
a
cause
which
means
employment
at
will.
i'm
looking
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page
there,
the
last
question
and
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know
that,
but
i
was
just
indicating
that
this
question
and
answer
at
--
and
without
more
support,
footnote
10.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
the
district
court
labeled
the
whole
heading
of
its
opinion
on
--
beginning
on
page
25a.
plaintiffs
were
not
reappointed.
and
it's
quite
a
different
thing
from
being
discharged
and
if
two
of
the
necessary
--
of
the
five
oaths
necessary
to
support
a
majority
judgment
in
--
in
elrod
against
burns,
limited
themselves
to
the
question
of
whether
it
was
unconstitutional
to
discharge
people
because
of
their
political
beliefs.
if
these
people
were
not
discharged,
then
elrod
is
not
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
his
expectation
that
--
that
this
in
fact,
whatever
the
law
was.
in
fact,
this
was
a
--
an
appointment
of
indefinite
duration.
is
that
in
the
record
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
covered
by
--
that's
not
covered
by
elrod
at
all,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
issue
here,
then
it's
not
covered
elrod
against
burns,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
