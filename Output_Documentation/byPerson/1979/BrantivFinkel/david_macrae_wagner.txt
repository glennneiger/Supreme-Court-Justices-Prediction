mr.
david
macrae
wagner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
the
issue
that
was
being
dealt
with
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
just
before
the
lunch
and
recess,
which
is
the
question
of
the
permanency
of
the
appointments
of
--
of
assistant
public
defenders.
i
think
the
record
will
show,
firstly,
mr.
finkel
was
appointed
with
less
than
a
year
remaining
in
the
term
of
his
appointing
public
defender,
arnold
becker.
page
94
of
the
record
further
shows
that
mr.
finkel
left
another
job
to
take
that
job.
and
he
testified
not
only
that
he
believe
his
appointment
permanent,
subject
only
to
the
right
of
the
public
defender
to
discharge
him
for
improperly
performing
his
job,
but
that
he
would
not
have
left
one
job
to
go
to
another
job
with
only
nine
months
of
tenure
remaining.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
district
court
found
that
it
--
that
a
set
term
or
a
lack
thereof
was
irrelevant
in
his
application
of
elrod
to
the
fact
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
he
decided
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
set
term.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
respectfully,
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
while
employees
can
be
dismissed
for
no
reason,
they
cannot
be
dismissed
for
the
wrong
reason.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
and
i
might
further
go
on
to
point
out
that
mr.
finkel,
whatever
the
procedure
is
in
mr.
parris'
county
attorney's
office,
mr.
finkel
testified
that
when
mr.
barone
replaced
mr.
becker,
he
was
not
formally
reappointed.
he
took
no
formal
steps
to
remain
in
the
office.
he
was
merely
told
casually
and
verbally
to
stay
on.
this
is
not
a
far
cry
from
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
described
whether
it's
a
set
term
and
you
must
take
an
oath
of
office
or
you
have
no
legal
standing
whatsoever.
the
court,
i
think,
very
accurately
foresees
the
situation
here.
there's
a
big
void,
there
is
no
statutory
provision
setting
a
fixed
term
or
an
unfixed
term
for
an
assistant
public
defender.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
then,
your
honor,
i
would
refer
back
to
perry
v.
sindermann
where
there's
a
very
similar
situation.
there
was
a
--
an
unwritten
agreement
in
--
in
essence
that
untenured
teachers
in
fact
did
by
tradition,
have
tenure.
the
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
yes,
which
expired
if
--
if
i
recall
the
facts
correctly,
your
honor.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
your
honor,
i
might
respectfully
point
out
that
mr.
finkel
who
was
in
the
public
defender's
office
for
seven
years
saw
under
mr.
becker
four
republicans
and
four
democrats.
under
mr.
barone,
approximately
the
same
mix,
4,
4
and
1
unregistered.
and
certainly,
mr.
tabakman
who
came
in
later
had
the
same
expectation
that
succeeding
public
defenders
would
continue
the
nonpartisan
policy
of
the
office.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
excuse
me.
the
number
of
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
yes.
mr.
finkel
testified
explicitly
that
he
thought
that
the
appointment
was
permanent.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe
it's
on
page
--
pages
76
and
77
of
the
appendix
and
also
page
94
on
either
recross
or
redirected,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
and
i
submit,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
militates
against
the
set
term,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
formal
requirement
of
taking
a
new
oath
or
any
formal
requirement
other
than
just
remaining
in
the
same
office
doing
the
same
job
for
a
new
boss.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
i
can
see
the
wording
--
i
--
i
concede
the
wording
which
of
course
implies
as
we
have
conceded
that
these
assistants
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
public
defender.
but
it
also
indicates
to
me
if
that
there's
a
continuing
employment
in
the
absence
of
an
action
on
the
--
on
the
part
of
a
mr.
branti,
who
attempts
to
terminate.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
your
honor,
we
took
the
position
in
the
district
court
that
these
were
in
effect
continued
employments.
they
were
not
as
in
(inaudible)
set
by
statute
at
a
fixed
term.
the
district
court
judge
as
i
interpreted
his
decision,
took
no
position
on
that.he
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
exactly
judge
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
--
white
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
i
read
footnote
10,
justice
broderick
says,
the
fact
that
these
plaintiffs
are
removable
at
will
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
of
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
therefore,
i
don't
think
judge
broderick
reached
that.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
elrod
read
in
conjunction
with
perry.
the
expectation
of
continued
employment
i
believe
covers
a
situation.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
first
of
all,
the
district
court
did
so
find
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
that
finding.s
econdly,
i
think
although
my
learned
adversary
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
not
janitors,
effect
which
i
will
be
the
first
to
concede,
these
lawyers
are
very
unlike
other
lawyers
in
government.
these
are
not
people
who
give
advice
to
town
boards,
to
zoning
boards,
they
are
not
hired
by
the
government
to
advise
the
government.
they
are
hired
by
the
government
to
represent
individual
indigent
defendants.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
they
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
the
public
defender
himself,
yes.
but
he
has
instructed
his
assistant
public
defenders
as
to
what
they
can
and
cannot
do.
in
fact,
mr.
parris
gave
a
hypothetical
example.
i
can
give
the
court
an
actual
example.
the
district
attorney
in
rockland
county
has
established
a
policy
that
he
will
not
accept
pleas
to
a
lesser
offense
in
cases
of
driving
well
intoxicated
where
the
blood
alcohol
reading
is
in
excess
of
.20.
this
is
a
policy
that
all
his
assistant
district
attorneys
must
follow.
the
district
attorney
like
the
public
defender
himself
says
the
policy.
the
assistants
disobey
that
policy
at
their
peril
and
they
are
subject
as
the
plurality
in
elrod
pointed
out,
to
dismissal
for
cause.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
--
i
think
we're
drawing
the
distinction
here
between
case
by
case
discretion
which
both
mr.
barone
and
mr.
branti
indicated
that
individual
assistant
public
defenders
have
and
broad
--
the
broad
overall
goals
of
the
office
as
referred
to
in
the
plurality
where
the
public
defender
says,
“it
shall
be
the
goal
of
our
office
to
concentrate
on
marijuana,
police,
driving
while
intoxicated,
whatever
you
choose,
and
then
it
is
up
to
his
employees
to
follow
that
broad
policy
scope,
but
they
do
not
decide
in
the
initial
instance
what
the
policy
of
the
office
will
be.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
this
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
--
the
sheriff
in
elrod
was
entitled
to
sheriff's
deputies
who
followed
his
policy
directives.
and
of
course,
any
employer
is
entitled
to
have
loyal
employees.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
there
is
a
difference
on
a
general
basis,
but
when
you
--
when
you
look
at
the
specific
duties
that
these
gentlemen
performed,
is
there
such
a
great
difference
between
trying
a
case
--
an
individual
case
on
a
case
by
case
basis
within
the
guidelines
laid
down
by
the
public
defender
and
the
decisions
made
by
a
deputy
sheriff.
the
deputy
sheriff
has
the
decision
of
life
and
death
over
a
fleeing
perpetuator.
there
are
--
any
job
that
involves
any
degree
of
discretion,
there
are
some
case
by
case
policy
decisions
to
be
made.
for
example,
the
deputy
sheriffs
maybe
instructed.
always
fire
one
warning
shot
before
you
shoot
at
--
at
a
fleeing
felon,
or
never
fire
your
firearm
under
certain
circumstances.
that
is
a
policy
directive.
or
they
may
be
given
a
certain
latitude
with
regard
to
whether
they
used
their
firearm
in
--
in
isolated
areas
or
metropolitan
areas.
these
case
by
case
decisions,
i
submit,
are
not
the
policy
making
referred
to
by
this
court
in
elrod.
there
is
always
in
practically
any
occupation,
some
degree
of
case
by
case
review
by
the
individual.
now,
mr.
parris,
my
learned
adversary,
indicated
in
some
detail
the
value
of
a
system
which
enables
young
attorneys
to
enter
the
political
system
and
in
effect
get
a
leg
up
into
politics
and
like
mr.
parris,
i
got
my
start
in
politics
the
same
way,
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
system.
however,
that
is
not
the
way
it
works.
of
the
appointees
made
to
these
positions,
they
were
--
the
people
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
who
were
the
mature,
the
politically
active,
the
successful
who
were
able
to
get
these
favorite
jobs
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
your
honor,
indicated,
i
may
have
stretched
your
point
a
little
bit,
[laughter]
but
your
honor
indicated
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
your
honor,
i
thought
your
point
was
that
in
order
to
get
ahead
in
politics,
you
had
to
join
one
of
the
parties.
i
must
say,
you
don't
make
a
good
living
without
it.
but
you
have
to
be
a
member
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
i'm
sorry
i
misconstrued
your
honor's
comments
in
that
case.
but
the
--
that
does
not
take
away
from
the
point
that
i
was
attempting
to
make
which
is
essentially
that
it
is
not
the
young
attorneys
fresh
out
of
law
school,
who
get
these
positions,
because
they
--
with
rare
exceptions,
unless
they
have
some
family
political
influence,
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
obtain
these
appointments.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
no,
your
honor,
it's
a
fixed
salary.
the
reason
that
it
is
part
time
is
because
as
mr.
parris
indicated,
there
are
23
justice
courts
and
it's
more
important
to
have
a
relatively
large
number
of
part
time
employees
than
fewer
full
time
employees
because
a
lot
of
this
is
night
work.
and
with
23
courts
to
be
covered,
it's
necessary
to
have
a
large
number
of
personnel
available
several
evenings
a
week
and
plus
days
in
the
office.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
they're
--
they're
assigned
two
days
a
week
in
the
office,
plus
each
attorney
is
assigned
certain
specific
courts
in
which
they
appear
and
handle
regular
calendars.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
some
are
evenings,
some
are
day
sessions.
it
depends
on
when
the
individual
court
happens
to
sit.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
think
that's
exactly
the
situation
here
as
the
district
court
found.
no
one
who
did
not
receive
the
sponsorship
of
the
democratic
caucus
which
consisted
of
the
majority
of
the
county
legislature
was
considered
for
employment
as
an
assistant
public
defender.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
these
gentlemen
are
policy
making
or
confidential.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
perfectly,
if
these
were
in
fact
confidential
or
policymaking
positions.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe
that
that
is
what
perry
read
with
elrod
in
effect,
says.
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
significant
constitutional
distinction
between
holding
and
serving
in
a
position
that
you're
serving
in
well
whether
that
is
a
fixed
term
or
a
--
i
mean
determinate
term.
i
do
not
for
a
moment
concede
that
there's
a
fixed
term
in
this
instance.
i
think
it's
an
indeterminate
term.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
no,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
believe
if
you
--
if
you
read
his
testimony
in
context
with
some
later
cross-examination,
he
realized
he
served
at
the
pleasure
of
the
public
defender,
but
that
he
would
not
be
terminated
as
long
as
he
did
his
job
properly.
this
was
the
experience
under
the
two
prior
public
defenders
of
rockland
county.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
isn't
that
what
this
court
has
said
that
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
someone
who
serves
at
will
can
be
terminated
for
no
reason,
but
not
an
improper
reason
and
i
would
submit
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
he
cannot
be
fired
for
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
yes.
yes,
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that's
--
no,
that's
why
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
say
only
for
cause.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
will
not
go
any
further
with
the
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
you're
right.
i
will
not
go
any
further
than
to
say
he
cannot
be
fired
for
constitutionally
impermissible
reasons.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
if
--
if
he
is
discharged
--
if
he
is
discharged
allegedly
for
cause.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
not
statutorily,
your
honor.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe
that
that
whether
would
be
a
constitutional
right
to
that,
but
not
with
the
statute.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
right.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
if
it
were
alleged
that
he
had
in
some
way
improperly
performed
his
duties
and
he
claimed
he
had
not
improperly
performed
them,
i
believe
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
certainly,
there's
an
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
no,
that's
correct.
i
--
i
said,
your
honor,
if
he
were
allegedly
dismissed
for
improperly
performing
his
duties,
he
would
have
a
hearing.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
that
would
be
discharge
for
a
cause.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
no.
again,
your
honor,
i
will
have
to
fall
back
on
my
statement
that
he
can
be
discharged
for
any
reason
except
an
impermissible
one,
except
the
constitutionally
abhorrent
reason.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
specifically
in
this
case,
as
the
district
court
found,
these
assistant
public
defenders
were
not
continued
in
their
employment
solely
because
they
were
not
members
of
the
majority
political
party
in
rockland
county
and
were
not
sponsored
by
members
of
that
party.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
absolutely,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
exactly
what
we
contend,
that
they
are
--
the
district
court
so
found,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
finding,
they
are
case
by
case
representatives
of
the
indigent.
they
do
not
make
government
policy.
they
do
not
advise
government
boards.
they
do
not
even
advise
the
public
defender
other
than
to
say,
“here
i
am,
give
my
files
to
go
to
court,
and
i'll
represent
the
indigent.”
that
is
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
don't
believe
there's
anymore
confidentiality
there
than
a
deputy
sheriff
for
police
officer
saying
so
and
so's
bar
in
downtown
rockland
county
is
a
hangout
for
young
alcoholics
and
there
are
fights
there
every
night,
we
ought
to
increase
our
police
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
exactly,
your
honor.
it's
--
again,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
is
a
recommendation
to
a
policymaker
which
may
or
may
not
be
acted
on
the
public
defender,
still
has
the
absolute
right
to
say
you're
wrong,
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
he
makes
the
policy.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe
that
that
was
judge
broderick's
definition
of
confidentiality
which
i
think
is
a
good
one.
one
who
stands
in
a
confidential
relationship
to
a
policymaker,
but
he
as
i
limits
that
to
--
for
example,
a
--
the
confidential
secretary
to
a
town
supervisor,
a
confidential
law
secretary
to
a
judge,
someone
with
whom
there's
a
very
close
interaction.
i
don't
think
that
as
i
read
elrod,
this
confidentiality
extends
to
an
entire
office
of
people
who
were
essentially
employees.
undoubtedly,
the
chief
assistant
public
defender's
confidential
because
he
is
the
alter
ego
of
the
public
defender
just
like
mr.
newcomb.
in
the
newcomb
case,
who
was
the
deputy
city
attorney
who
had
--
who
made
policy,
made
law,
was
in
line
to
succeed
as
mayor
of
the
city
of
milwaukee,
i
believe
it
was.
certainly,
he
was
a
policymaker,
but
the
city
attorneys
under
him
were
not
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
yes,
your
honor.
as
to
what
to
be
done
about
a
case,
but
that
again
is,
as
the
plurality
points
out,
decision
making
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
not
broad
overall
implementation
of
policy
such
as
concentrated
on
a
particular
type
of
crime
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it
falls
within
mr.
justice
white's
analogy
of
the
police
officer
who
says,
“we're
having
troubles
getting
a
search
warrant
from
a
certain
judge.”
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
it's
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
--
probably,
the
lowliest
clerk
at
the
fbi
must
keep
his
information
confidential,
but
does
that
make
him
constitutionally
unprotected
as
a
policymaker?
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
believe
the
communication
is
confidential,
but
i
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
i
do
not
believe
that
that
creates
a
confidential
relationship
as
this
court
meant
it
in
elrod,
because
if
you're
going
to
make
that
many
employees
confidential,
then
aren't
you
in
a
sense
--
in
--
in
essence
vitiating
the
holding
in
elrod?
oh,
i
think
the
plurality
in
elrod
very
meticulously
detailed
the
reasons
for
excluding
confidential
and
policymaking
employees
and
left
the
others
protected
by
that
holding.
and
the
reason
was,
as
i
interpret
it,
that
the
policymaking
and
confidential
employees
were
in
a
position
to,
in
effect,
thwart
the
goals
of
the
newly
appointed
public
defender
or
sheriff
or
whatever.
whereas,
assistant
public
defenders,
the
only
way
that
they
could
embarrass
or
interrupt
the
operation
of
the
public
defender's
office
would
be
if
they
did
not
competently
perform
their
jobs.
and
then,
of
course,
they
could
be
discharged
for
cause.
so
that,
i
submit
that
they
do
not
come
in
under
the
heading
of
those
who
must
be
excluded
from
the
elrod
holding
because
they
are
in
a
position
to
obstruct
their
supervisors.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
well,
it
maybe
different
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
of
course,
it's
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
then
again,
he
is
not
properly
performing
his
job,
just
isn't
as
--
mr.
david
macrae
wagner
corruption
is
never
easy
to
monitor
anymore
than
it's
easier
to
monitor
a
corrupt
deputy
sheriff
who
takes
bribes
to
let
felons
escape.
it
happens.
we
try
and
prevent
it,
but
it's
going
to
happen
no
matter
how
hard
we
try.
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
setting
criteria
in
my
opinion.
thank
you.
