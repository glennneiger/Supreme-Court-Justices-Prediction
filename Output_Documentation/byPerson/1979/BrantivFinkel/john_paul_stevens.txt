were
--
were
these
people
part
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
part
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
practice
on
this
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
parris,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
of
you
about
this?
you
said
that
they
would
have
to
take
--
your
people
have
to
take
an
oath
in
the
new
term.
well,
this
testimony
doesn't
say
that
and
those
statutes
says
if
you
call
to
it,
why
do
you
say
they
have
to
take
a
new
oath?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
what
in
civil
service
law
says
that?
what
if
they
just
stayed
on
and
nothing
was
done.
as
i
understand,
the
way
this
is
written,
he
--
he
began
the
process
of
executing
termination
notices
for
six
of
the
nine
assistants
who
had
served
under
barone.
i
--
i
thought
you
under
--
he
indicated
if
he
had
done
nothing,
they
would
have
just
continued
on
the
payroll,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
they
would
not
have
stayed
on
the
payroll,
is
there,
if
he'd
done
nothing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
it's
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
it's
error?
your
witness
doesn't
say
that
and
the
law
doesn't
say
that
and
regulations
don't
say
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
you're
required
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
requirement
that
you
imposed,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
didn't
impose
that
requirement
at
all
and
nothing
at
all
was
done
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
it
not
true
they
would
continue
just
to
get
their
paychecks
in
the
ordinary
routine
to
continue
to
do
their
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
you
were
and
that's
not
what
the
district
court
said
at
all.
at
page
25a
he
said,
“the
third
and
final
requirement
of
the
concurrence
in
elrod
is
that
the
attempt
to
remove
plaintiffs
from
their
jobs
have
been
based
upon
the
sole
ground
of
their
political
beliefs,
i
find
that
this
requirement
has
been
satisfied.
is
--
doesn't
that
a
finding
that
the
only
reason
that
they
--
for
the
removal
was
their
political
beliefs?
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
interpret
on
page
2
(a).
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“judge
broderick
found
that
appellant
had
attempted
to
terminate
their
employment
on
the
sole
ground
of
their
political
beliefs.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
we
concede
something
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
is
the
public
defender
of
rockland
county
new
york.
he
is
a
democrat
and
was
appointed
to
office
by
the
county
legislature
after
the
democrats
gained
control
of
that
body.
as
soon
as
he
took
office,
he
began
the
process
of
replacing
all
of
the
assistant
public
defenders
who
had
been
appointed
by
his
republican
predecessor.
the
respondents
are
two
of
those
assistants.
they
brought
this
action
to
enjoin
petitioner
from
discharging
them
solely
because
of
their
political
beliefs.
the
district
court
found
that
respondents
are
competent
attorneys
and
that
the
sole
ground
for
their
removal,
was
that
their
political
beliefs
differed
from
those
of
the
ruling
democratic
majority.
the
district
court
enjoined
petitioner
from
removing
them
from
office
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
three
years
ago,
in
elrod
against
burns,
this
court
held
that
the
newly
elected
sheriff
of
cook
county
illinois
could
not
dismiss
certain
clerks,
deputies
and
janitors
simply
because
they
refused
to
join
the
democratic
party.
in
this
case,
petitioner
asks
us
to
distinguish
the
elrod
case
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
the
holding
in
elrod
is
limited
to
situations
in
which
government
employees
are
coerced
into
pledging
allegiance
to
a
political
party
that
they
would
not
voluntarily
support
and
does
apply
to
a
simple
requirement
that
an
employee
be
sponsored
by
the
party
in
power.
and
second,
that
even
if
party
sponsorship
is
an
unconstitutional
condition
of
continued
public
employment
for
clerks,
deputies,
and
janitors,
it
is
an
acceptable
requirement
for
an
assistant
public
defender.
for
reasons
stated
in
a
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reject
both
of
these
arguments
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined
and
in
part
i
of
which,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined.
