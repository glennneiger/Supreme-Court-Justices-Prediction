chief
justice

e.

gentlemen,
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
branti
against
finkel
and
others.
mr.
parris,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
county
could
set
up
a
civil
service
system
for
public
defenders
and
prosecutors
if
it
wanted
to,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
legislature
could
do
the
same
thing,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
neither
the
state
legislature
nor
your
legislative
body
in
rockland
county
has
undertaken
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
do
it
in
prosecutors
or
public
defenders.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
it
works
better
or
not
is
of
no
concern
to
the
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
parris,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
receive
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they're
originally
appointed,
do
they
receive
a
document
or
a
certificate,
something
like
the
one
that
the
president
gives
to
the
members
of
his
cabinet
which
ends
with
the
words,
“at
the
pleasure
of
the
president?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
get
any
piece
of
paper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
that's
what
i
have
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
--
you
haven't
mentioned
anything
yet
and
i
hope
you
will
at
some
point
at
your
convenience,
of
the
policy
relationship
that
exists
between
the
management
of
the
office
and
all
of
the
staff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
do
it
at
your
own
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
correct,
yes.
also,
historically,
respondents
had
sought
some
people
in
this
office
that
had
been
rehired
and
others
that
hadn't
been.
they
both
tried
and
used
political
friends
to
try
to
receive
recommendations.
it
doesn't
sound
like
someone
with
an
objective
expectancy
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
public
defender
on
his
own
decide
that
he
does
not
want
to
have
part
time
assistance
anymore
and
just
abolish
the
positions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
--
the
legislation
itself,
fixes
part
time
and
full
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
wrong
with
your
arguing
that
kind
of
an
issue
is
not
also
assuming
this
has
--
is
relevant.
would
it
not
be
equally
relevant
that
this
is
related
to
the
existence
of
a
two-party
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
still
lands
whether
that's
relevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case
however.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
commission
of
the
united
states
attorney
as
those
famous
last
three
words,
“to
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president,”
four
words,
at
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
proceed,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
sindermann
had
a
contract,
didn't
he,
year
--
year
by
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
meaning
for
10
consecutive
years
which,
as
i
recall
the
courts
not
created
an
expectancy
of
continuation
to
--
at
least
that
was
a
factor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what
about
a
situation
where
the
--
the
new
public
defender
comes
in
and
says
from
the
new
policy
of
this
office
for
which
i
am
responsible
will
be
that
we
will
take
no
guilty
pleas
at
all
or
alternatively,
he
says
the
policy
of
this
office
will
be
that
your
or
to
direct
all
your
efforts
to
negotiate
a
plea.
we've
got
to
get
this
calendar
moving.
now,
does
that
not
involve
very
high
policy
in
terms
of
operating
that
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
how
--
how
is
the
prosecutor
or
the
public
defender,
the
head
of
the
staff
going
to
follow
what
each
one,
was
it
nine
assistants,
is
going
to
do
on
each
specific
case.
in
many
instances,
that
assistant
will
be
handling
10
or
20
cases
in
one
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
--
my
point
was,
is
it
possible,
feasible,
with
the
volume
of
cases
you'd
have
in
these
relatively
minor
offenses
to
monitor
what
each
one
is
doing
or
is
he
not
entitled
to
have
--
select
a
person
of
his
own
choice
in
whom
he
has
confidence
and
sure
knowledge
that
they'll
carry
out
his
policies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
factor
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
had
already
--
i
thought
you
had
already
conceded
that
there's
quite
a
difference
between
the
deputy
sheriff
and
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
work
fixed
hours
or
how's
their
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
evenings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
the
assistant
sometimes
give
legal
opinions
to
their
superiors
as
to
what
should
be
done
about
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
--
if
he's
doing
that,
he's
in
the
relationship
with
the
lawyer
to
a
client
essentially,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that's
certainly
a
confidential
matter,
isn't
it,
if
--
if
nothing
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
--
let's
stay
with
this
situation.
an
assistant
says
"let's
keep
away
from
judge
jones.
he
just
never
will
give
us
a
warrant."
now,
is
that
a
confidential
communication
within
that
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
--
don't
you
think
a
defense
council
could
throw
a
case
as
it
were
if
you
know
what
i
mean
by
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
is
--
and
do
it
--
if
he
did
it
skillfully
in
a
way
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
establish
that
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
not
very
unpopular
defendant
and
the
community
is
aroused
and
wants
that
fellow
to
go
to
jail
and
the
--
this
assistant
defenders
politically
ambitious
and
--
so
he
just
lets
his
fellow
go
down
the
drain.
it's
--
that's
a
possibility,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it's
easy
to
--
to
monitor
that
kind
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
parris?
you
have
about
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ford
motor
credit
--you
don
not
say
that
and
i
don't
believe
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
78-1654,
branti
against
finkel
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
