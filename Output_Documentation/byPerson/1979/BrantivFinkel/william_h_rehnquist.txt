justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
your
second
--
your
second
question,
counsel,
whether
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
this
country
to
end
the
patronage
system
is
not
really
a
constitutional
question
over
which
this
question
would
--
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
as
a
--
it's
up
to
new
york
or
nassau
county
unless
there's
a
constitutional
provision
to
the
contrary
to
make
that
decision
for
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
what
--
what
about
page
32
(a)
of
the
appendix.
i
--
i'm
wondering
how
--
how
semantically
and
how
substantive
this
discussion
we've
been
having
as
where
you
have
footnote
10,
where
judge
broderick
says,
“the
fact
that
plaintiffs
are
removable
at
the
will
of
the
public
defender
is
of
course
irrelevant
to
the
--
the
determination
of
the
constitutional
issue
prevented
herein.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
a
--
substantive
distinction
between
a
person
being
removable
at
will
and
a
person
whose
term
expires
at
a
given
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
--
are
you
referring
to
the
plurality
in
elrod
or
--
or
to
the
--
there
was
several
separate
opinions
in
elrod.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
to
--
in
your
response
to
my
brother
white.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
--
isn't
the
real
question
not
whether
the
--
the
patronage
system
is
desirable
or
undesirable
or
whether
new
york
has
chosen
or
not,
but
this
was
a
civil
rights
action
where
judge
broderick
felt
--
found
that
rockland
county's
application
of
it
violated
the
federal
constitution.
and
unless
it
violates
the
federal
constitution,
new
york
is
free
to
choose
its
bizarre
system
of
promotion
as
it
--
as
it
wants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
certain
inconsistency,
isn't
there?
be

between
the
two
facts
which
leads
we,
apparently
believe
to
be
the
facts
that
you
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
an
official
for

of

years

in

justice
william
h.
rehnquist

the
u.s.
attorney
i
think
it's
both.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel,
what
do
you
make
of
footnote
10
in
judge
broderick's
opinion
at
page
32a
of
the
appendix,
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
are
removable
at
the
will
of
the
public
defender,
not
for
a
cause
but
at
the
will
of
the
public
defender?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
page
77,
there's
the
question
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
“did
you
approach
mr.
barone
about
being
retained
in
your
position?”
answer,
“no,
he
just
continued
me
in
office."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
answer
was,
“he
continued
me
in
office,”
not,
i
remained
in
office.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
your
basic
claim
that
this
is
a
perry
against
sindermann
and
roth
versus
board
of
regents
type
of
case
where
even
though
the
people
had
no
job
tenure
claim,
they
were
fired
for
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
or
an
elrod
against
burns
case,
or
do
you
see
no
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
elrod
doesn't
--
elrod
covers
it
if
they're
--
unless
they're
confidential
or
policymaking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that,
then
don't
you
have
to
argue
here
that
or
sustain
the
--
the
holding
below
that
these
positions
were
not
in
fact
confidential
or
policymaking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
construction
job
isn't
the
same
as
--
as
a
confidential
or
policymaking
assistant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
be,
but
for
the
reason
hindered
by
--
suggested
my
--
by
my
brother
stewart,
i
don't
think
the
answer
to
the
question
about
whether
construction
jobs
are
assigned
only
to
democrats
or
republicans,
answers
the
question
of
whether
one
may
choose
only
republicans
or
democrats
for
confidential
or
policymaking
position.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
not
entitled
to
be
discharge
only
for
a
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
--
and
what
are
those
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
are
involved
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
then
you've
got
to
show
in
addition
to
that,
that
they
were
not
confidential
or
policymaking
officials.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
well,
what
if
one
of
them
comes
into
the
public
defender
and
says,
i
think
we've
got
a
real
problem
with
judge
so
and
so
in
such
and
such
a
precinct.
and
i
think
we
ought
to
try
to
transfer
all
the
cases
we
can
out
of
that
precinct
to
another
one.
now,
isn't
there
some
sort
of
confidentiality
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
faithfully,
a
confidential
employee
is
the
one
who
makes
a
recommendation
to
a
policy
maker
and
not
in
himself
will
recommend
a
policymaker.
isn't
not
so?
