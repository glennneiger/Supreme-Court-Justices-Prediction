justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
provision
do
you
--
of
the
new
york
law
do
you
rely
on
for
that
latter
statement
that
the
assistant's
terms
ended
when
the
public
defender's
term
ended.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
law
says
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
says
it
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
serve
at
his
pleasure.
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
is
that
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
an
ordinance
that
says
at
his
pleasure?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
necessarily
the
predicate
for
the
district
court's
judgment
that
you
couldn't
fire
them,
that
they
couldn't
be
fired
for
the
political
beliefs.
that
their
term
lasted
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
term
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
a
public
defender.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
don't
--
don't
you
think
the
--
the
--
don't
you
think
the
district
court
read
new
york
law
and
saying
their
term
does
not
end
with
--
with
the
term
of
the
public
defender?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
behind
--
i
know
but
we
don't
usually
second
guess
district
judges
about
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
you
could
argue
that
reading
--
that
it's
fair
to
read
judge
broderick's
opinion
as
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
--
whether
--
whether
the
term
expired
or
not.
that
failure
to
reappoint
is
subject
to
the
same
constitutional
rule
as
--
as
if
the
term
was
held
to
extend
until
fired.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i've
--
if
that
is
the
--
and
if
--
if
that
poses
a
completely
different
question
if
he
held
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i'm
sure
you
--
you
would
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
work
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
as
--
could
i
ask
you?
suppose
the
terms
did
expire
and
the
public
defender
--
a
new
public
defender
put
out
a
notice
on
the
wall
and
said,
“only
--
only
democrats
need
to
apply
or
only
republicans
need
to
apply.
i'm
just
not
interested
in
hiring
anybody
but
democrats.
does
elrod
cover
a
situation
like
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
it
wasn't
alright
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
let's
assume
that
these
employees,
everybody
agreed
to
these
employees
were
--
were
policymaking
and
confidential,
let's
just
assume
that
they
--
or
that
--
that
they
were
not.
assume
they
were
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
policymaking
or
confidential
and
they
put
on
--
you
put
on
the
sign
on
the
wall,
“only
democrats
need
apply.
we're
--
we're
in
a
process
of
rehiring
and
your
terms
have
expired,
but
none
of
you
who
is
an
--
who
is
a
republican
need
apply.”
does
elrod
cover
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
say,
it
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
that
argument
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
term
of
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
--
and
the
four
years
can
expire
and
if
you
aren't
reappointed,
you're
through.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
no,
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
u.s.
attorney.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
attorneys.
justice
byron
r.
white
evidence,
said
it
made
no
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
if
--
even
if
their
terms
expire,
with
the
public
defender's
term,
the
failure
to
reappoint
them
for
this
kind
of
a
reason
was
constitutionally
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that's
the
--
that's
the
judgment
you're
defending
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
question
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
take
any
position
--
you
say
the
district
judge
didn't
take
any
position
on
whether
it
was
a
termination
or
a
renewal.
that's
--
that's
what
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
so
you're
saying
even
if
this
was
a
failure
to
reappoint,
even
if
their
terms
had
expired
and
it
--
and
it
was
only
a
failure
to
reappoint,
the
fact
that
they
--
that
they've
refused
to
reappoint
because
of
their
political
beliefs
is
constitutionally
wrong
like
the
district
court
concluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
pay
pretty
good
for
these
things
in
rockland
county
and
some
parts
of
the
country.
it's
pretty
much
pro
bono
almost
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
any
different
in
some
county
rule
that
says
where
in
the
next
year,
we're
probably
going
to
have
10
public
construction
projects,
but
only
democrats
or
republicans
need
--
need
been
on
these
--
or
limit
to
bidding
opportunities
to
democrats
or
republicans?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
get
you
across
the
bridge
that
there's
no
difference
between
discharge
and
reappointment.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
different
--
that's
a
different
point
in
saying
i
--
that's
a
much
stronger
expectation
than
saying,
i
serve
at
his
will
and
he
can
fire
me
for
any
reason
he
wants
to
accept
my
political
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
--
that's
a
different
--
still,
nevertheless
it's
considerably
different
from
what
you
have
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
as
far
as
you
need
to
go,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
couldn't
he
be
fired
to
replace
him
with
his
brother?
i
mean
that's
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
not
for
a
cause,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
you
would
say
that
if
--
that
he
couldn't
fire
him
because
of
his
political
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
he
--
if
he
had
alleged
that
he
was
then
fired
for
an
unconstitutional
reason,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
maybe
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
say
that
--
why
would
you
say?
you
just
concede
--
what
if
he
said
--
what
if
he
said,
“well,
i
was
fired
--
i
was
doing
my
job
well,
but
i
was
fired
because
--
not
because
i
didn't
do
my
job
well,
but
because
he
want
to
replace
me
with
my
brother.”
he
wouldn't
get
any
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
we're
having
trouble
getting
search
warrants
from
the
certain
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
hopes
it
is.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some,
they
don't.
