mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
dr.
henry
kissinger.
he
is
the
petitioner
in
1088
and
the
cross-petitioner
in
1217.
the
material
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
it
comes
here
on
a
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
at
the
white
house
and
that
the
state
department,
dr.
kissinger
had
his
secretaries
to
monitor
his
telephone
conversations,
take
short
hand
notes
of
what
was
said
and
prepare
rough
typewritten
summaries.
the
practice
was
specifically
approved
for
senior
department
officials
by
state
department
policy.
the
purpose
was
to
ease
the
administrative
burdens
of
office
by
enabling
dr.
kissinger’s
personal
aides
without
further
briefing
to
implement
and
follow
up
what
was
said
or
what
was
agreed.
they
were
used
as
work
aides
and
it
was
these
follow
up
actions
that
produce
the
records
which
are
presently
in
the
department’s
files,
aide
memoirs,
memorandums
of
telephone
conversations,
memorandums
of
the
file,
other
documents
which
were
circulated
and
filed
in
the
normal
course
of
business
in
the
state
department,
and
these
official
records
are
voluminous.
the
notes
themselves
were
not
made
or
kept
as
records.
they
do
not
have
the
form
of
records.
they
were
never
edited.
they
contain
omissions.
they
are
not
accurate.
they
were
never
circulated
outside
of
dr.
kissinger’s
office.
no
one
other
than
dr.
kissinger
and
his
immediate
aides
had
access
to
them.
mr.
david
ginsburg
both
of
the
white
house
period,
mr.
chief
justice
and
of
the
state
department,
both
periods,
always
retained
in
personal
files
within
his
office,
never
part
of
either
the
white
house
files
or
the
state
department
files.
the
notes
reflect
almost
all
of
dr.
kissinger’s
telephone
conversations
regardless
of
content.
they
contain
notes
of
both
official
and
personal
matters,
some
important
and
some
of
course,
inconsequential.
intermingling
was
unavoidable.
mr.
david
ginsburg
simply
by
the
affidavits
that
are
in
file
in
this
record
by
those
that
have
examined
the
notes
and
we
have
the
affidavits
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
were
some
things
that
are
said
in
the
notes
that
are
said
to
be
not
accurate.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
omissions
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
were
some
telephone
conversations
that
were
not
taken
although
almost
all
as
the
affidavits
in
this
record
show
were
taken.
mr.
david
ginsburg
both,
your
honor.
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
is
that
some
of
the
secretary
knew
in
some
cases
that
were
purely
personal.
in
the
event
that
it
was
a
personal
telephone
call
and
no
record,
very
personal
telephone
call,
no
record
was
made,
but
in
the
normal
course,
every
telephone
call
by
aides,
by
the
president,
by
whoever
it
was,
the
conversation
was
recorded
and
the
notes
were
made.
these
notes
were
reviewed
by
dr.
kissinger,
his
affidavit
is
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
there
are
omissions,
inaccuracies
in
the
notes
that
were
taken
and
there
were
other
omissions.
of
course,
had
dr.
kissinger
known
that
these
notes
might
be
viewed
as
official
agency
records,
he
would
either
have
put
them
in
proper
form
for
filing
or
more
likely
he
would
discontinue
the
practice
altogether.
now,
towards
the
end
of
his
term,
dr.
kissinger
decided
to
donate
both
his
harvard
papers
and
the
papers
he
accumulated
in
government
service
to
the
united
states
and
he
chose
the
library
of
congress
as
the
custodian
because
it
has
been
used
as
the
depository
by
many
other
secretaries
of
states
and
as
the
government
points
by
a
great
many
other
cabinet
officers.
the
donation
process
within
the
department
included
several
steps.
each
of
which
was
approved
by
the
legal
adviser,
by
the
assistant
secretary
for
administration,
by
the
deputy
undersecretary
for
management
and
by
the
director
of
the
department's
record
center.
mr.
david
ginsburg
all
of
them
were
subordinates,
your
honor.
all
of
them,
and
if
i
may
point
out
to
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
does
not,
sir.
in
a
memorandum
signed
by
all
of
these,
dr.
kissinger
was
advised
that
his
personal
files
were
freely
transferable
to
the
library
under
the
department’s
regulations.
each
signer
of
the
memorandum
knew
that
the
notes
were
in
dr.
kissinger’s
personal
files.
the
legal
adviser
gave
dr.
kissinger
a
formal
written
opinion
confirming
the
previous
oral
advice
that
the
notes
were
not
state
department
agency
records.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
is
appointed
by
the
president,
sir
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
is
a
respected
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
and
in
that
opinion,
the
legal
adviser
considered
the
agency
regulations,
government
practice
and
analogous
judicial
opinions
and
he
concluded
“that
these
particular
papers
are
personal
and
may
be
retained
by
you
when
you
leave
office,
but
as
a
precaution,
to
assure
that
the
government’s
records
were
complete,
the
legal
adviser
recommended
that
dr.
kissinger
review
and
make
extracts
of
any
discussion
of
significant
policy
decisions
or
actions
not
otherwise,
reflected
in
the
official
files”
and
this
was
done.
now,
dr.
kissinger
donated
all
of
the
papers
subject
to
deeds
of
gift
which
restrict
access
to
the
collection
and
these
restrictions
were
designed
to
protect
the
classified
information
in
the
notes
and
the
other
records
and
the
privacy
rights.
the
notes
will
be
made
available
for
public
access
after
25
years,
but
only
with
the
consent
of
those
who
participated
in
the
conversations
if
they
are
then
still
living.
after
the
donations
were
publicly
announced
and
after
the
notes
and
the
other
papers
were
transferred
to
the
library,
the
reporters'
committee
filed
requests
and
the
military
audit
project,
filed
request
with
the
state
department
for
these
records.
both
requests
were
denied.
both
denials
were
made
by
persons
then
serving
under
secretary
vance.
the
grounds
for
denial
were
that
the
notes
were
not
state
department
agency
records
and
that
the
department
in
any
event
did
not
have
them
in
its
custody
or
control.
the
military
audit
project
and
the
reporters'
committee
then
filed
separate
freedom
of
action
suits
against
the
state
department
and
secretary
vance
and
named
dr.
kissinger
and
the
librarian
of
congress
as
defendants.
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
held
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
did
not
apply
to
notes
of
the
white
house
period,
but
that
the
state
department
period
notes
where
agency
records
subject
to
the
act.
the
court
then
ordered
dr.
kissinger
and
the
library
of
congress
to
return
all
the
state
department
notes
to
that
department
for
processing
and
release
under
the
freedom
information
act.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
librarian
was
named
as
a
party
to
the
action,
although
of
course,
he
is
not
an
agency
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
of
course,
neither
is
dr.
kissinger
as
an
individual,
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
so
that
as
we
see
it
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
gives
the
military
audit
project
and
the
reporters'
committee
a
right
of
access
to
documents
which
the
state
department
has
specifically
determined
were
not
its
records
before
any
requests
for
them
were
filed
and
records
which
it
does
not
have
and
cannot
produce.
now,
first
the
issue
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
make
a
point
simply
to
avoid
the
problem
in
order
to
clarify
the
issue
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
proper
relinquishment,
whatever
it
was.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
argument
would
be
the
same
and
i
think
that
is
clear
that
the
act
does
not
apply
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
our
primary
submission
and
this
is
a
submission
with
which
the
government
agrees
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
is
--
it’s
the
issue,
mr.
chief
justice
of
--
of
course,
not
all
documents
in
the
hands
of
agency
are
records.
they
do
not
become
records
until
they
are
filed
as
records.
the
court
was
concerned
in
the
previous
case
with
the
definition
of
records.
records
as
we
see
it
are
simply
those
documents
which
are
defined
as
records
for
purposes
of
federal
records
act
which
are
filed
by
the
agency
as
its
records.
so
that
in
this
case,
the
issue
was
clear.
they
were
not
filed
as
records.
they
could
not
have
been
filed
as
records.
they
were
always
kept
in
the
personal
files
within
the
office
of
dr.
kissinger,
never
circulated
outside
of
his
office,
never
seen
by
anyone
other
than
his
closest
aides
so
that
when
we
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh!
it’s
clear
that
they
were
not
records
of
the
state
department.
the
state
department
never
treated
them
as
records,
never
sought
to
use
them
as
records,
there
was
no
declaration
that
they
were
records.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
wouldn't
say
that
is
all
of
our
argument,
that's
the
central
portion
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
that
is,
sir.
that
is
of
course
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
also
our
argument,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that’s
exactly
right.
they
were
not
records,
they
were
not
treated
as
records,
they
didn't
look
like
records,
no
one
thought
of
them
as
records
and
no
one
else
saw
them.
mr.
david
ginsburg
possession?
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
are
making
the
point
that
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
the
possession
argument
comes
into
this
argument
simply
because
these
notes
are
presently
in
the
hands
of
the
library
of
congress
and
to
secure
them
is
not
simply
a
ministerial
act
of
obtaining
them
from
the
bailee.
a
lawsuit
is
required
to
obtain
these
documents.
i
point
out
first
that
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that’s
absolutely,
yes.
the
requesters
in
this
case
rely
solely
on
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
that
statute,
as
this
court
has
read
repeatedly
this
morning,
gives
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
agencies
from
withholding
agency
records.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
absolutely
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
enter
any
order
in
this
case.
first,
neither
dr.
kissinger
nor
the
library
of
congress
is
an
agency
under
the
act,
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
cannot
be
used
to
sue
private
citizens
and
adjudicate
their
rights,
their
substantive
rights.
and
second,
the
state
department,
of
course,
is
an
agency,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
violated
the
act
by
withholding
any
agency
records.
the
reporters
committee
and
the
military
audit
project
say
that
it
did
on
the
theory
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
imposes
a
duty
on
the
department
to
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
under
bannercraft,
it’s
very
clear
that
the
renegotiation
board
had
those
records.
they
were
in
the
possession
and
control
of
the
agency,
no
doubt
about
it.
and
this
was
an
action
to
enjoin
the
continuation
of
the
procedures
in
that
case,
and
at
that
time
the
court
observed
that
it
could,
having
jurisdiction,
with
records
in
the
hands
of
the
agency,
the
court
could
of
course,
exercise
its
equitable
jurisdiction
and
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
protect
that
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
case,
the
records
were
never
in
the
hands
of
the
agency
as
agency
records,
and
presently
of
course
they
are
in
the
hands
of
the
library
of
congress.
bannercraft
i
think
has
no
application
here.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
was
irrevocable,
under
a
deed
of
trust.
mr.
david
ginsburg
certainly
not.
this
was
in
the
hands
--
at
least,
these
notes
are
now
owned
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
custody
of
the
library
of
congress.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
have
been
a
problem
–
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
sir.
i
think
that
here
the
question
is,
you
are
speaking,
you’ve
used
the
term
"records"
and
this
is
i
think
a
problem
that
the
court
must
consider
here.
the
moment
you
use
the
word
"records,"
we’re
dealing
with
something
that
an
agency
has
determined
were
its
records,
and
if
we’re
not
dealing
with
records
as
we’re
not
dealing
with
records
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
claim
that
they
should
have
been
records,
that
the
state
department
should
have
regarded
these
notes
as
records,
but
they
didn't
and
they
specifically
determined
that
they
didn't.
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh!
that’s
exactly
right.
this
is
the
first
issue
that
i
am
seeking
to
address
now,
is
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
not
whether
they
were
records.
there
is
a
problem,
and
i’ll
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
and
to
consider
that
issue
if
the
court
ever
reaches
it.
but
the
central
issue
of
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
these
were
[laughter
attempt]
not
records,
they
were
not
regarded
by
the
state
department
record,
they
were
viewed
as
records,
and
never
treated
as
records,
and
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
if
they
were
in
dr.
kissinger's
basement
as
personal
property
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
--
which
of
course
he
could
have
done
at
any
time
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
don't
think
it’s
legally
irrelevant
except
in
the
sense
that
-
mr.
david
ginsburg
to
this
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that's
right.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
is
no
way
in
which
dr.
kissinger
can
just
reach
over
to
these
notes
and
bring
them
back
into
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
nor
has
the
state
department
any
control
over
the
library
of
congress.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
for
this
purpose,
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
they
are
indeed
and
they
were
so
determined
by
the
department.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
bears
any
income
tax
advantage
--
is
that
what
you
said,
sir?
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
sir,
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
but
i
can
assure
the
court
that
there
is
none.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
ginsburg
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
issue
was
not
here
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
part
of
this
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right,
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
they
were
not
created
for
the
purpose
of
records.
they
were
created
for
the
purpose
of
advising
his
immediate
aides
as
to
what
he
had
just
said
so
that
he
didn't
have
to
tell
them
right
away
what
he
had
talked
about
on
the
phone.
they
read
it
and
then
they
spoke
with
others
within
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
records
do
not
become
records
until
they
are
so
determined
by
the
--
there
is
no
question
in
this
case,
there
cannot
be
a
serious
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
fact
did
dr.
kissinger
create
an
adequate
record
of
all
of
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
the
state
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
fundamentally
that
was
the
position
also
of
the
legal
adviser,
that
the
records
were
made
as
a
consequence
of
the
calls
that
were
made
immediately
after
or
the
file
memoranda
that
were
made
immediately
after
the
calls
were
made,
and
they
were
put
into
the
records
of
the
department.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
differ
only
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
alsup
will
be
here
in
a
moment
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
--
is
that
it
depends
on
the
united
states'
interpretation
of
the
legal
adviser's
memorandum.
the
government
as
i
understand
it,
suggests
that
mr.
lee
intended
to
make
the
excerpting
process
a
condition
of
the
transfer
of
the
records.
this
as
we
see
it,
the
opinion
is
in
the
record
for
all
to
see,
it
seems
to
us
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
not
his
intention.
that
he
determined
on
the
basis
of
an
analysis
of
the
state
department's
own
regulations
that
dr.
kissinger
had
an
absolute
right
to
retain
these
notes
within
his
files,
and
that
he
did
and
he
determined
that
these
were
his
personal
papers,
but
he
said
as
a
matter
of
precaution,
leaning
over
backwards,
“you,
dr.
kissinger,
look
through
your
files
to
determine
whether
this
should
be
done.”
dr.
kissinger
didn't
do
it
himself,
he
had
mr.
eagleburger
do
it,
the
deputy
undersecretary
for
management,
and
that
was
done.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
has
done
his
job
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
if
he
did
[voice
overlap]
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
state
department
regulations.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
is
a
moment
of
time
at
which
those
--
the
moment
between
the
time
when
the
records
--
when
these
notes
were
made
and
before
they
were
turned
over
to
anyone,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
was
some
issue,
but
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
everyone,
that
the
totality
of
the
information
in
the
records,
in
those
notes
was
immediately
transferred
to
the
rest
of
the
department
and
then
by
reason
of
that
memorandum
prepared,
memorandum
of
conversations
and
these
became
the
records
and
they
are
the
records.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
do
indeed,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
am
running
out
of
time.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
is.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
is
indeed.
well,
we
say
that
what
the
court
below
did
in
this
case
is
clear,
which
is
to
create
a
private
right
of
action.
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
if
the
records
or
if
the
notes
are
in
the
possession
of
the
agency,
they
must
be
provided,
but
here
they
were
not.
the
court
attempted
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
by
exercising
its
general
equitable
jurisdiction
under
cort
v.
ash
in
order
to
retrieve
these
records.
it
seems
to
us
absolutely
clear,
as
you
read
the
freedom
of
information
act,
that
this
cannot
be
done.
the
congress
was
explicit
in
the
case,
agency
--
that
the
records
may
not
be
withheld
from
an
agency,
that
agency
records
may
not
be
withheld,
and
it
seems
to
me
absolutely
clear
in
these
circumstances
that
a
private
right
of
action
cannot
be
constructed
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
contrary
it
seems
to
us
under
the
federal
records
act.
there
is
absolutely
a
right
of
action
in
the
government
to
retrieve
these
notes
in
the
event
of
need.
it
is
very
clear
that
under
the
federal
records
act
the
attorney
general
on
the
instance
of
the
administrator
of
the
general
services
administration
and
of
the
secretary
involved
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
state,
to
retrieve
these,
to
bring
an
action
under
section
3106,
44
u.s.
code
3106,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
government's
right
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
private
requesters
may
insist
that
this
action
be
done
and
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
the
case
in
our
view,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
ginsburg
three
minutes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
military
audit
project
counsel
said
that
the
solicitor
general
had
conceded
that
these
notes
were
agency
records
in
their
inception.
this
is
an
issue
to
which
justice
white
addressed
himself
earlier.
i
simply
wish
to
correct
the
record.
the
solicitor
general
can
speak
for
himself,
but
he
said
that
they
would
be
regarded
as
non-record
materials.
i
make
the
simple
point
that
if
they
are
non-record
materials,
then
of
course
they
are
not
subject
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
which
applies
only
to
records.
this
is
a
problem
that
has
to
do
with
the
federal
records
act
and
not
with
the
freedom
of
information
act.
now,
the
implications
of
the
argument
that
the
court
has
just
heard
from
the
reporters
committee
should
be
clearly
understood.
the
first,
that
the
claim
is
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
can
be
used
not
only
to
obtain
records
in
the
custody
and
the
possession
and
in
the
control
of
an
agency,
but
as
a
basis
for
requiring
the
return
to
an
agency
of
materials
that
it
relinquished
before
the
request
was
made.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
the
attorney
general's
authority
was
invoked
under
the
federal
records
act
and
the
claim
was
both
by
the
administrator
of
general
services
and
the
attorney
general
referring
these
and
the
secretary
of
state
referring
the
issue
to
the
attorney
general,
he
has
plenary
power
under
the
federal
records
act
to
pursue
the
matter.
that
is
a
problem
of
ownership,
the
problem
of
whether
it’s
an
initially
a
record
is
simply
a
different
matter
and
a
different
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
would
still
leave
that
issue
to
be
determined,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
these
were
never
records
and
never
treated
as
records,
but
the
implication
is
one
that
we
would
be
able
to
use
this
statute
as
a
basis
for
requiring
the
return
of
material
that
it
already
relinquished.
it
would
be
required
as
a
basis
to
obtain
materials
which
an
agency
had
determined
were
not
its
records.
it
would
mean
that
private
attorneys
general
would
now
be
implied
under
the
federal
--
the
freedom
of
information
act
so
as
to
supplement
in
a
sense
the
activities
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
federal
records
act,
and
finally
it
would
also
mean,
if
this
approach
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
were
taken,
that
private
citizens
might
be
able
to
use
the
freedom
of
information
act
not
only
against
agencies
of
the
united
states,
but
also
against
private
citizens
and
also
against
institutions
that
were
not
agencies
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
thank
you.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we’ve
considered
that
problem,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
all
of
those
facts
could
be
established
and
the
person
in
a
sense
were
aggrieved,
that
there
would
be
a
basis
for
a
remedy
i
think
as
suggested
in
other
cases
that
the
court
has
recently
considered
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
if
there
was
a
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
the
person
was
aggrieved.
if
there
was
a
grievance
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh!
i
think
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it’s
clearly
not
a
lawless
removal.
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
remedy
--
the
only
possible
remedy
that
could
be
invoked
that
this
is
an
issue
conceivably
for
amendment
of
the
statute,
but
the
only
possible
remedy
that
could
be
invoked
presently
under
the
law
as
we
know
it
would
be
the
equivalent
of
a
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
if
one
could
show
injury,
if
one
could
show
damage
of
some
sort
and
that
there
was
a
basis
for
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
under
the
foia.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
be.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
certainly
would
be
our
submission.
that
is
not
something
you
could
mandamus
the
attorney
general
to
file
a
suit.
it
would
be
discretionary
within
the
power
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
my
view,
sir.
