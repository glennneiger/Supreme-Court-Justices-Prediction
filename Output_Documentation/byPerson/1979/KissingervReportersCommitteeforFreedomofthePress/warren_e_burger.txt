we
will
commence
--
we
will
resume
at
1
o’clock
with
kissinger
against
the
reporters
committee
and
consolidated
case,
and
counsel
may
take
their
place
at
the
table
before
we
return.
mr.
ginsburg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
of
the
white
house
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
these
omissions
deliberate
or
inadvertent
simply
because
of
the
difficulties
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
librarian
--
was
the
librarian
a
party
to
the
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ginsburg,
when
this
agency
makes
a
determination
before
any
demand
is
pending
or
when
a
demand
is
made
that
particular
material
is
not
an
agency
record.
what
is
the
review
procedure
that
is
available
for
that
other
than
judicial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whatever
they
were,
could
--
was
dr.
kissinger's
gift
to
the
library
of
congress
irrevocable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
could
not
individually
carry
out
a
command
to
get
them
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
any
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
any
available
at
the
time
he
made
the
gift?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
there
is
no
such
action,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
ginsburg.
mr.
alsup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
had
an
alternative,
your
colleague
had
an
alternative
that
they
could
not
be
commanded
by
anyone
to
give
up
the
possession
or
something
that
didn’t
possess
even
assuming
it
was
a
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
his
alternative
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
make
them
property,
the
fact
that
government
employees
and
government
materials
went
into
their
construction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
said
that
mr.
truman,
when
he
was
president,
dictated
every
night
a
diary
of
the
day's
events
and
assuming
that
was
done
and
it
was
also
said
that
he
frequently
referred
back
to
these
things
with
respect
to
conversations
he
had
had
with
cabinet
officers
or
various
other
people.
now,
these
were
all
made
with
government
facilities,
they
certainly
had
a
relationship
to
his
job,
would
that
make
those
diary
tapes
government
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
assumed
that
there
could
be
a
mix
in
these.
there
might
be
something
about
his
opinion
of
the
music
critic
of
the
washington
post
on
what
she’d
said
about
or
what
he’d
about
his
daughter’s
musical
abilities,
on
the
her
hand
there
might
be
come
comments
about
what
he
and
what
he
directed
to
the
attorney
general
to
do
or
what
he
had
told
the
secretary
of
the
interior
not
to
do.
now,
when
you
once
segregated
them,
would
that
make
them
partially
government
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
a
letter.
this
is
a
tape
recording
dictated
in
diary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
his
conversation
with
the
attorney
general
or
secretary
of
his
cabinet
would
surely
be
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
referred
to
these
negotiations
that
are
going
on,
discussions
whether
or
if
anyone
uses
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
we
dispose
of
the
issues
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dobrovir.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
the
first
question
is
whether
there
is
private
cause
of
action
available
here.
will
you
address
that
at
some
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
surely
at
that
time
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
or
acting
independently
or
the
administrator
of
gsa,
operating
independently
perhaps
could
have
commenced
the
lawsuit,
you
agree
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
archivist
is
the
subordinate
of
the
administrator
of
gsa,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
said
there
was
an
additional
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dobrovir,
you
are
down
to
a
little
more
than
one
minute
and
we
haven't
heard
very
much
about
the
private
cause
of
action,
at
least
i
haven't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
situation
meets
the
criterion
of
something
enacted,
especially
for
the
particular
class
of
people
seeking
the
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sussman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean,
on
the
18th
of
january
they
were
already
in
the
possession
of
the
library
of
congress,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
demanded
them
their
return,
could
he
secure
their
return
in
his
individual
capacity
after
he
had
made
the
gift
which
the
government
says
is
an
irrevocable
gift,
as
ginsburg
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
a
fact,
that
someone
did
advise
him
that
they
were
no
longer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
facts
are
just
the
contrary,
haven’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
any
request
ever
made
of
the
attorney
general
to
get
into
this
matter
that
you
are
aware
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nor
gsa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
not
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes
left,
mr.
ginsburg.
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
would
be
a
difference
possibly,
mr.
ginsburg
between
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
pursue
records
and
retrieve
them
by
replevin
and
the
obligation
of
the
state
department
to
deal
under
the
act
with
records
of
papers
that
they
no
longer
possess?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
still
have
to
be
decided
whether,
assuming
they
were
owned
by
the
state
department,
and
therefore,
properly
back
in
state's
possession,
whether
they
were
agency
records
under
the
foia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
would
be
up
to
the
attorney
general
and
it
would
be
a
discretionary
act,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
