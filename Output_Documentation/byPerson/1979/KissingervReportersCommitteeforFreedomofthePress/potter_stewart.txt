all
of
them
of
course
were
subordinates
of
dr.
kissinger
while
he
was
secretary
of
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but
nevertheless,
really
has
anything
to
do
with
your
primary
argument,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
the
determination
of
the
state
department
may
have
been,
wouldn’t
your
argument
really
be
the
same
as
if
you
just
eliminated
that
middle
language
and
said
does
the
foia
cover
and
impose
a
duty
upon
the
state
department
to
not
to
withhold
and
to
deliver
records
that
it
does
not
have?
justice
potter
stewart
but
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wouldn’t
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
your
arguments
--
justice
potter
stewart
conversely,
even
if
they
were
once
“agency
records,”
there
is
no
obligation
to
turn
--
well
the
state
department
to
turn
over
something
that
may
be
once
might
have
been
an
agency
record,
if
it
does
not
at
the
time
of
the
request
have
possession
and/or
control
of
it,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
also
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
central
portion
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
of
course
your
entire
argument,
but
that’s
also
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
is
not
a
lawsuit
under
the
foia?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
that’s
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
argument,
it
is
argumentative?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
not
records,
wherever
they
are.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
first
argument.
it
is
roman
one
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
because,
mr.
alsup,
that
material
that
is
not
in
the
possession
and
control
of
an
agency
cannot
by
definition
be
an
agency
record?
that
was
the
argument
that
the
government
made
in
the
previous
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
previous
case,
you
didn't
bend
that
to
my
brother
stevens'
suggestion.
you
said
that
material
that
is
not
in
the
possession
and
control
of
an
agency
cannot
be
an
agency
record
by
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
take
a
different
position
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
last
case,
you
did
see
a
very
real
need
to
it
or
you
wouldn't
have
used
that
against
the
united
states
government
would
hardly
make
that
argument
unless
it
felt
they
needed
to?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it
used
to
be
a
record.
whether
it
is
a
record
or
we
may
have
used
it.
it
used
to
be
an
agency
record,
but
if
it
is
no
longer
on
the
possession
and
control
of
the
agency
it
is
by
definition
an
agency
record,
that
was
the
government’s
argument
in
the
previous
case.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
accept
the
argument
of
the
united
states
government
made
in
a
previous
case,
it
is
a
matter
of
definition
under
the
foia,
nothing
can
be
an
agency
record,
it’s
not
in
the
possession
and
control
of
the
agency
then
that
is
the
end
of
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
the
very
argument
that
the
government
made
on
the
last
case
and
you
are
shying
away
from
it
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
alsup,
we
interrupted
you
a
great
deal
and
i
hesitate
to
do
it
again,
but
just
to
aid
my
understanding
of
your
argument,
we
do
not
reach
this
issue
if
we
accept
your
first
argument,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
relevant
test
is
not
whether
or
not
they
are
records
but
whether
or
not
they
were
called
“agency
records,”
you
agree
with
that,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
the
same,
but
they
were
agency
records
and
remained
agency
records
if
they
were
wrongfully
removed
from
the
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
say
it
was
stolen,
quite
unlawfully
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
simply
isn’t
there?
it
does
not
exist
so
far
as
the
agency
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
stolen
and
taken
to
timbuktu,
how
can
the
agency
possibly
comply?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
how
can
anybody
withhold
something
that
he
doesn’t
have?
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
an
foia
cause
of
action,
that’s
your
submission,
whether
removal
was
lawful
or
lawless?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
existing
foia.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that
is
true,
then
there
is
no
--
if
you
are
correct,
then
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
whether
or
not
the
removal
was
lawful
or
lawless?
