justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginsburg,
how
do
you
know
there
were
omissions
or
how
does
anyone
know
they
were
omissions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
are
some
things
that
were
said
on
the
phone,
but
are
not
on
the
notes,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
how
about
omissions,
you
said
there
were
omissions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
were
some
telephone
conversations
that
were
not
noted?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
then
not
agency
records
even
if
they
were
still
at
the
state
department?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
as
my
brother
stewart
has
asked
you
that
even
if
the
records
were
in
the
possession
of
the
state
department
at
this
time
or
if
these
papers
were
in
the
possession
of
the
state
department,
they
would
not
be
subject
to
the
act
because
they
were
not
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
make
the
possession
argument
in
your
brief,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
you
say
they
aren't
records
subject
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
subject
to
production
and
hence
it
is
irrelevant
to
you
whether
they
are
in
possession
of
the
state
department
or
not,
at
least
it
is
irrelevant
for
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
mr.
ginsburg,
i
take
it
that
your
argument
does
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
at
no
time
was
any
of
these
--
was
any
one
of
these
papers
a
record
for
the
purposes
of
the
foia.
let’s
say
the
minute
after
the
transcription
was
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
any
extracts
were
made
for
the
purposes
of
the
files?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
is
that
is
why
he
created
them,
so
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
tell
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
it
seems
to
me
that’s
an
argument
for
saying
that
these
papers
at
least
until
they
have
been
extracted,
to
extract
the
--
to
take
out
the
materials
relevant
to
the
state
department
business,
that
were
critical
to
the
state
department
business,
would
be
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
ginsburg,
you
emphasized
the
fact
that
dr.
kissinger
went
through
the
procedure
that
the
legal
adviser
suggested,
namely
why
don't
you
go
through
these
notes
of
yours
and
make
sure
everything
is
taken
out
of
them
that
should
have
been
taken
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
proceeded
to
do
that.
you
would
say
he
didn't
need
to
do
that
at
all
because
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
was
in
the
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
position
really
is
fundamentally
different
from
that
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there’s
quite
a
difference.
i
would
assume
they
would
have
answered
my
question
differently
that
until
they
were
extracts,
they
were
state
department
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
secretary
of
state
is
talking
on
the
telephone
and
making
agreements
or
making
plans
or
making
proposals
that
his
colleagues
ought
to
know
about,
he
should
communicate
them
and
he
has
one
of
two
ways
of
doing
it,
i
suppose.
one,
he
can
take
his
time
and
communicate
them
orally
and
he
doesn't
need
to
keep
any
records,
i
suppose,
or
he
can
do
it
the
way
he
did,
he
made
notes
and
had
them
extracted
and
communicated.
now,
if
he
didn't
do
either
he
wouldn't
be
doing
his
job,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
wouldn't
be
doing
his
job
if
he
didn't
do
either,
if
he
didn't
communicate,
if
he
chose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
if
he
chose
to
communicate
in
a
certain
way,
namely
not
orally
but
by
in
writing,
and
if
the
only
thing
there
was
that
you
--
if
there
were
ten
recordings
or
ten
transcriptions
of
telephone
conversations
that
had
never
been
extracted
and
there
they
were
and
they
contained
important
information
that
had
never
been
communicated,
why
would
you
say
that’s
not
a
state
department
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
didn't
you
just
answer
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
–
it’s
easy,
it
would
be
easy,
whether
they
were
they
ever
were
records
or
whether
they
are
still
records
then
for
purposes
of
the
records
act,
they
are
not
for
purposes
of
the
foia
because
they
are
not
in
the
possession
and
control
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
colleague
in
the
previous
case
argued
that
it
wasn't
an
agency
record
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
now
because
it
wasn't
in
possession
and
control
and
he
says,
let's
forget
this
no
withholding
business
or
at
least
just
use
the
withholding
to
shed
light
on
what
is
in
an
agency
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
mr.
geller
said,
but
his
bottom
line
was
that
this
is
not
an
agency
record
for
foia
purposes,
that
was
his
bottom
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
yours
is,
you
say
now
we
don't
even
have
to
think
about
whether
it
is
an
agency
record,
if
you
are
not
withholding
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
certainly
suggested
to
us
that
if
we
agreed
with
him,
we
should
approach
the
case
and
the
words
you
use
would
be
talking
about
what
is
an
agency
record
and
your
conclusion
would
be
if
you
agreed
with
him,
this
is
not
an
agency
record.
that
was
his
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
good.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
this
case?
how
about
this
case?
as
i
understand
the
state
department
doesn’t
want
these
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
asked
for
them
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i’ll
put
it
this
way;
do
you
think
that
you
are
representing
the
views
of
the
state
department
head?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
the
statement
--
the
state
department
through
you
is
asking
these
notes
be
reviewed
in
the
hands
of
the
library
of
congress
to
see
if
they
have
been
fully
extracted?
justice
byron
r.
white
seek
to
return
or
just
get
them
extracted?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
your
position
on
that
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it’s
rather
important
you
take
the
position
because
for
purposes
of
freedom
of
information
act,
if
all
this
state
department
interested
in,
is
making
sure
they’ve
properly
extracted
and
the
official
business
is
taken
out
of
them,
they
have
copies
of
it,
that
doesn’t
mean
at
all
that
the
papers
need
to
be
returned,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
once
they
get
back
to
the
state
department,
they
are
foia
papers.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
makes
quite
a
difference
on
what
position
you
take
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
there’s
always
--
if
they
want
to
sample
them,
and
they
do
sample
and
which
they
are
now
doing
and
they
decide
that
they
should
be
reviewed
and
further
extracts
made.
they
can
do
that
--
perhaps
they
can
do
that.
but
does
that
mean
they
have
to
have
the
papers
returned
to
them
or
leave
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
they
never
would
be
your
foia
papers
except
to
the
extent
they
were
extracted?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
library
--
what
if
he
said
those
very
words
to
the
librarian
and
the
librarian
said,
“i
am
awfully
sorry,
but
i
think
you
are
ill-advised
right
now,
and
you
gave
these
to
us,
we
are
going
to
keep
them
until
the
court
tells
us
to
give
them
back?”
justice
byron
r.
white
could
mr.
kissinger,
as
secretary
of
state
or
mr.
kissinger
either
as
secretary
of
state
or
personally
have
the
--
would
he
under
any
relevant
statute
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
department,
i
mean
against
the
state
library?
justice
byron
r.
white
through
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
well,
the
state
department
could
not
become
a
party
by
itself.
it
would
have
to
get
the
attorney
general
to
file
a
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
attorney
general
would
have
to
agree
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
position
that
these
records
are
retrievable
just
at
the
request
of
the
state
department,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
aren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
law
says
that
a
party
to
get
them
back
if
they
are
illegally
possessed
by
somebody
else
is
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
now
though
is
whether
the
state
department
is
withholding
any
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it,
and
if
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
records
is
to
win
a
lawsuit,
first
convince
the
attorney
general
to
sue
and
then
to
win
it,
are
they
withholding
records
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
if
you
on
that
basis,
if
you
win,
what’s
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
order,
turn
them
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
what
if
you
were
the
adviser
of
the
state
department,
how
would
you
proceed,
go
down,
go
across
the
street
and
ask
him
for
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
library
said
awfully
sorry,
then
you
would
go
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
an
foia
suit
could
be
used
to
secure
judicial
review
of
every
single
decision
by
an
agency
to
dispose
of
a
non-record
record
once
it
thinks
that
it
has
served
its
purposes.
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
file
an
action
and
say
that
the
agency
made
a
mistake
and
they
were
dead-wrong
in
deciding
that
this
document
has
served
its
purposes
and
that
the
officer
may
take
it
away
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
that’s
exactly
what
an
foia
case
could
be
used
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
retrieving
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
other
opt
if
you
wouldn't
want
to
be
bound
by
the
attorney
general's
decision,
perhaps
you
could
get
judicial
review
of
his
decision,
that
doesn't
mean
you
shouldn't
have
to
seek
his
decision
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
normal
rule
is
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i
suppose
that
the
department
of
justice,
which
is
headed
by
the
attorney
general,
has
a
position
in
this
lawsuit
that
is
directly
contrary
to
yours
that
this
isn't
an
foia
--
that
this
isn't
any
longer
the
business
of
an
foia
lawsuit
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginsburg,
is
it
correct
under
your
submission
that
say,
an
agency
became
aware
of
an
pending
foia
request
before
it
was
filed,
that
the
person
who
had
custody
of
all
the
records
that
might
be
the
subject
of
the
request
could
simply
take
them
home
and
keep
them
until
after
the
request
had
been
filed
and
then
they
would
avoid
compliance.
