mr.
robert
m.
sussman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
return
to
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case,
the
question
of
whether
documents
which
were
agency
records
at
the
time
of
their
removal
and
were
so
we
argue
removed
unlawfully
are
agency
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
therefore,
are
subject
to
judicial
relief
within
the
terms
that
act.
it
is
true
that
we
are
here
before
the
court
today
not
under
the
federal
records
act.
we
believe
that
is
the
statute
for
the
government
to
enforce.
we
are
here
instead
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
a
statute
which
creates
rights
on
behalf
of
private
citizens
who
seeks
to
obtain
records
of
the
united
states
government.
our
primary
submission
and
a
submission
which
we
believe
controls
the
resolution
of
this
is
that
if
the
transcripts
were
removed
unlawfully
from
the
department
of
state,
they
remain
records.
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
if
the
transcripts
were
removed
lawfully
pursuant
to
statutes
and
regulations,
they
lost
their
record
statutes
status
and
the
act
ceases
to
apply.
i
think
we
have
to
start
with
the
text
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
oh!
that’s
absolutely
true,
although
we
do
argue
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
that
is
absolutely
our
argument.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
our
argument
is
that
the
act
on
its
face
applies
the
agency
records.
if
the
document
has
been
unlawfully
removed,
it
preserves
its
legal
status
as
an
agency
records,
therefore,
it
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
congress
in
enacting
the
freedom
of
information
act
specified
nine
exemptions.
defined
very
clearly
for
determining
when
documents
would
fit
the
definition
of
records
could
not
be
produced
by
federal
agencies.
it
did
not,
and
i
think
this
is
very
key,
it
did
not
create
an
exemption
to
documents
which
are
agency
records
in
every
respect
but
happen
not
to
be
in
the
physical
custody
of
the
agency.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
then
i
think
the
act
no
longer
applies
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
then
the
act
would
apply
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
the
agency
quite
obviously
should
not
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
the
agency
cannot
produce
what
it
does
not
have
and
if
the
document
is
physically
unavailable,
if
there
is
no
physical
way
that
the
agency
can
retrieve
the
document
and
provide
it
to
the
foia
requester,
then
obviously
it
is
not
withheld.
the
agency
doesn’t
have
the
capacity
to
produce
the
document.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
i
think
the
word
“had”
has
to
be
construed
broadly
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point.
the
agency
does
not
have
unlawfully
removed
records,
in
the
sense
that
those
records
are
in
its
physical
possession,
that
is
to
say,
the
state
department
could
not
go
down
to
the
basement
of
the
department
of
state
and
get
these
transcripts.
however,
there’s
another
plain
on
which
we
can
approach
the
problem,
and
we
can
think
of
possession
not
merely
as
physical
possession,
but
as
legal
possession,
and
we
would
submit
that
an
agency
certainly
has
what
it’s
owns
and
its
ownership
rights
certainly
do
not
turn
on
the
physical
location
where
records
are
kept.
we
would
say
and
i
think
this
case
illustrates
it
quite
plainly
that
if
an
agency
owns
a
document,
it
has
a
legal
right
to
reduce
that
document
to
possession
at
any
time.
it
is
the
owner
of
the
document,
therefore,
it
has
the
means
of
producing
the
document
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
it
can
provide
it
and
i
think
this
case
illustrates
that
perfectly.
mr.
kissinger
was
secretary
of
state
at
the
time
the
freedom
of
information
act
requests
were
made.
therefore,
he
had
it
well
within
his
means
and
power
to
produce
these
documents
if
in
fact
they
were
owned
by
the
department.
even
after
mr.
kissinger
was
secretary
of
state,
i
think
you
have
the
exactly
the
same
situation.
the
department
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
they
were
already
in
the
possession
of
the
library
of
congress,
that's
true.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
think,
your
honor,
he
could
have
done
it
in
either
capacity.
as
secretary
of
state
he
could
have
said
to
the
library
of
congress,
i
have
now
reexamined
the
law,
i
have
been
advised
by
those
who
have
construed
the
federal
records
act
that
these
documents
were
not
my
personal
property,
therefore,
i
had
no
authority
to
remove
them,
and
therefore,
i
had
no
authority
to
donate
them
to
you,
and
i
think
they
ought
to
be
returned.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
nobody
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
he
was
advised
by
the
legal
adviser
that
they
were
not,
but
i
think
the
question
we
are
looking
at
right
now
is
the
question
of
withholding
and
the
question
of
whether
an
unlawfully
removed
document
is
within
the
power
of
an
agency
to
retrieve.
and
my
point
is
that
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
mr.
kissinger,
assuming,
contrary
to
the
facts,
that
he
did
conclude,
reassess
his
opinion,
decide
that
these
documents
were
indeed
records
would
have
been
very
simple
for
him
in
his
capacity
as
secretary
of
state
to
go
down
to
the
library
of
congress
and
say
these
are
department
records,
a
request
for
them
has
been
made
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
my
deed
of
gift
to
you
i
believe
is
superseded
by
that,
i
would
like
the
records
back
and
i
would
like
to
make
them
available
to
an
foia
requester
and
it
is
in
that
sense
that
i
think
that
one
has
to
conclude
that
these
transcripts
were
within
the
legal
control,
the
legal
control
of
the
department
of
state
at
the
time
the
foia
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
oh!
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
think
that
--
let
me
answer
the
question
in
two
ways.
i
think
that
the
state
department
would
have
a
cause
of
action,
as
awkward
as
it
sounds,
under
the
federal
records
act
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
through
the
attorney
general.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
that's
true,
but
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
the
attorney
general
would
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
let
me
re-frame
it
slightly.
let
me
say
this,
that
if
a
document
continues
to
be
owned
by
an
agency,
the
agency
we
would
say
is
under
a
duty
--
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
procure
that
document
to
the
extent
it
can.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
but
we
don't
even
need
to
reach
that
question
because
short
of
bringing
a
lawsuit,
there
are
actions
that
the
state
department
could
have
taken,
but
didn't
take
in
this
case
to
procure
the
return
of
the
notes.
we
don't
know
what
the
library
of
congress
would
have
said
if
the
state
department
had
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
think
that
the
state
department
is
withholding
records
if
it
has
failed
to
take
all
steps
within
its
power
to
procure
the
return
of
those
records.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
the
judgment
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
the
judgment
i
think
is
precisely
the
judgment
entered
by
the
court
below
and
that
is
an
order
to
the
state
department
to
go
out
and
to
repossess
from
the
library
of
congress
to
the
extent
of
the
library
is
willing
to
provide
the
documents
and
the
transcripts.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
would,
that’s
exactly
what
i
would
do.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
would
certainly
do
that
and
i
would
do
that
not
only
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
i
would
do
that
under
the
records
act
itself
because
the
records
act
imposes
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
part
of
an
agency
to
retrieve
unlawfully
removed
records.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
if
there
are
no
freedom
of
information
act
requesters,
the
issue
is
left
to
the
attorney
general,
but
if
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
it
should
make
a
difference
for
this
reason,
that
independent
of
what
is
or
is
not
done,
under
the
records
statute
citizens
have
a
private
cause
of
action
under
the
foia
to
obtain
records,
and
we
submit
that
cause
of
action,
to
records
which
are
covered
by
the
act
and
are
not
within
the
exemptions,
that
cause
of
action
should
not
and
cannot
be
conditioned
on
whether
the
attorney
general
does
or
does
not
choose
to
exercise
his
prosecutorial
discretion.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
9,999
of
every
10,000
such
suits
would
be
frivolous
because
it
would
be
very
clear
that
the
record-keeping
decision
of
the
agency
was
a
lawful
one
and
that
the
documents
was
removed
lawfully.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
that's
right,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
result
that
we
ought
to
be
fearful
of
or
concerned
about
because
there
is
a
very
clear
and
very
comprehensive
statutory
framework
for
removing
documents
from
public
to
private
property
and
if
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
and
for
retrieving
them,
but
i
come
back
to
the
point
i
made
before
and
that
is
that
we’re
not
only
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
government's
record-keeping
decisions
under
the
record
statutes.
we
are
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
public
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
what
we
are
asking
from
the
court
is
to
recognize
the
remedy
that
an
foia
requester
has,
when
a
document
otherwise
subject
to
the
act
has
been
unlawfully
removed
from
agency
custody,
and
we
submit
that
the
foia
is
a
free-standing
statute,
and
if
a
document
which
is
otherwise
a
record
has
been
removed
from
agency
custody
unlawfully,
then
we
don't
believe
that
a
prosecutorial
discretion
decision
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
agency
head
can
cut
off
the
public's
rights
under
the
act.
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
we
think
that
the
court
in
an
foia
case
has
to
reach,
has
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
removal
was
lawful.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
why
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
first
for
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
don't
think
that
we
are
talking
about
administrative
remedy
here.
the
administrative
remedy
under
the
foia
is
a
request
to
the
agency
to
produce
withheld
records.
that
is
the
only
administrative
remedy
that
the
act
provides,
and
that
is
what
we
did.
we
went
to
the
state
department
and
we
said
we
would
like
to
see
the
transcripts
of
mr.
kissinger's
telephone
conversations,
and
that
request
was
denied.
at
that
point,
we
think
that
we
had
a
right
to
a
judicial
remedy
under
the
statute
because
that
is
the
mechanism
that
congress
chose
for
vindicating
public's
rights
in
those
situations.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
not
by
the
foia
requesters
and
i
can't
speak
with
absolute
authority
about
the
state
department,
i
believe
that
it
also
never
made
a
request.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
gsa.
i
don't
believe
has
also
asked
the
attorney
general
to
bring
suit,
although
it
should
be
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
that
is
indeed
their
position
and
i
would
submit
that
if
there
were
a
judicially
created
duty
on
the
part
of
the
state
department
to
seek
the
return
of
these
records,
the
justice
department
might
be
somewhat
more
sympathetic
to
our
problem.
the
one
issue
that
i
have
not
discussed
is
the
question
of
whether
these
documents
are
records.
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief
about
it
and
simply
say
that
we
think
the
issue
turns
on,
first,
the
federal
records
act
themselves
and,
secondly,
gsa
regulations,
because
gsa
is
the
agency
that
congress
has
selected
to
implement
the
records
statute,
and
third,
state
department
regulations,
and
as
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs,
we
think
that
these
transcripts
are
plainly,
very
plainly
records
under
all
three
bodies
of
law.
i
believe
my
time
is
up
--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
it
is
not?
okay.
well,
i
would
be
happy
to
continue
a
little
while
longer.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
definition
of
records
in
the
records
statute.
we
have
a
rather
fundamental
and
direct
quarrel
with
both
the
government
and
with
mr.
kissinger
on
that
point.
they
make
the
argument
that
individual
agencies
have
broad
discretion
under
the
records
acts
to
determine
when
documents
concededly
relating
to
public
business
are
records
and
when
they
are
non-records.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
logical
or
sensible
to
adopt
that
reading
of
the
records
statute.
our
reason
is
this.
the
records
statute
contains
a
very
detailed,
a
very
specific
procedure
for
transferring
documents
relating
to
public
business
from
public
to
private
custody.
the
agency
must
list
those
documents
on
a
schedule,
submit
it
to
the
archivist,
and
it
must
determine
before
it
lists
those
documents
on
the
schedule
that
the
documents
have
no
longer
use
for
the
current
transaction
of
government
business
and
they
have
no
long-term
value
either
to
other
agencies
of
the
government,
to
the
government
as
a
whole
or
to
the
general
public.
now,
the
interpretation
of
the
records
act
proposed
by
the
government
would
allow
an
individual
agency
by
the
simple
expedient
of
classifying
a
document
as
a
non-record
material
to
exclude
it
entirely
from
the
archival
process,
in
which
case
the
careful,
detailed,
uniform,
and
consistent
scheme
adopted
by
congress
for
making
archival
decisions
would
be
bypassed
completely.
with
that,
i
would
like
to
close.
i
think
that
that
is
a
compelling
reason
in
and
of
itself
why
the
interpretation
of
the
act
offered
by
the
government
should
not
be
accepted.
thank
you.
