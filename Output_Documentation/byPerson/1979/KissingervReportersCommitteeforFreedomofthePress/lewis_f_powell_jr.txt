f.
powell,

even
if
one
assumes
that
these
are
agency
records,
don't
you
also
argue
that
these
petitioners
or
the
plaintiffs
below
have
no
private
cause
of
action
under
the
foia?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
going
to
address
that?
you
are
sort
of
running
out
of
time.
you
have
talked
a
lot
about
whether
or
not
they
are
records.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
a
very
substantial
additional
argument.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not
accept
the
--
an
opinion
of
the
legal
adviser?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understood
you
are
going
to
say
you
felt
the
agency
should
make
this
decision
rather
than
the
courts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
agency
in
this
case
said
it
through
its
legal
adviser
seems
already
to
admit
it.
so
by
virtue
what
right
does
the
solicitor
general
say
that
it
thinks
the
agency
decision
is
incorrect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
letâ€™s
take
this
case?
