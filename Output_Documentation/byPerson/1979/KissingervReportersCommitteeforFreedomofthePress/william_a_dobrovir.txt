mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
secretary
of
the
state
chose
to
record
and
communicate
to
his
aides
the
conduct
of
his
office
in
part
by
causing
the
preparation
of
verbatim
transcripts
of
his
business
telephone
conversations.
the
issue
is
whether
public
rights
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
can
be
defeated
by
the
secretary’s
removal
of
these
documents
from
the
state
department
building
prior
to
his
departure
from
office.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
will
address
it
now
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
state
department
denied
the
records
on
january
18
and
that
is
the
date
which
i
ask
the
court
to
remember.
it
said
we
deny
access
to
these
records
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
not
agency
records
because
they
were
personal
records
and
also
on
the
ground
that
they
are
no
longer
in
the
possession
of
the
department,
they
are
in
the
library
of
congress.
that
denial,
we
submit
and
i
will
present
my
theory
with
respect
to
that,
was
a
withholding
within
the
meaning
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
on
that
basis
there
was
a
cause
of
action.
the
cause
of
action
arose
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
he
could
have.
indeed,
as
the
record
reflects,
the
archivist
of
the
united
states
on
january
18,
the
same
date
that
the
state
department
denied
access
to
the
records,
was
also
denied
by
secretary
of
state
henry
kissinger,
acting
as
secretary
of
state
access
to
the
records
to
inspect
them
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
they
were
records
that
ought
to
remain
within
the
government’s
record
system.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
controversy
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
he
is.
we
assume
he
was
acting
within
the
authority
granted
him
by
his
superiors.
the
point
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
categorically
denied
him
access
to
these
records,
claiming
that
they
were
personal
records.
i
will
argue
the
question
of
the
district
court’s
power
and
the
question
of
the
cause
of
action,
mr.
sussman
will
argue
the
question
of
whether
the
records
are
agency
records.
i
would
only
say
here
that
we
agree
with
the
concession
made
by
the
solicitor
general
that
they
were
agency
records
in
their
inception.
we
disagree
with
him
when
he
says
that
they
could
at
a
later
date
or
did
at
a
later
date
not
become
lose
that
character
as
agency
records.
i
refer
to
january
18
and
i
told
the
court
what
happened
on
that
date.
the
petitioner
was
still
the
secretary
of
state
on
january
18,
and
it
was
in
his
capacity
as
secretary
of
state
that
the
department
under
his
supervision,
under
his
supervision
by
statute
denied
access
to
these
records.
the
denials
were
based
on
the
claim
that
they
were
his
personal
property,
his
refusal
of
access
to
the
archivist
was
based
on
the
claim
that
they
were
his
personal
property.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
with
respect
to
the
archivist,
that
was
the
only
basis.
with
respect
to
the
freedom
of
information
request
the
additional
basis
was
that
he
had
already
transmitted
them
to
the
library
of
congress.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
when
a
federal
government
official
acts
in
performing
the
duties
of
his
office,
he
is
presumed
to
act
for
the
agency.
the
petitioner
was
secretary
of
state
and
not
acting
as
a
private
individual,
and
everything
at
issue
here
occurred
when
he
created
the
records,
when
he
caused
them
to
be
written
down,
when
he
preserved
them,
and
he
preserved
them,
he
thought
that
they
were
appropriate
for
preservation
and
in
so
doing
i
think
he
was
acting
for
the
agency
of
which
he
was
the
agent
and
for
which
he
was
a
fiduciary.
it
was
a
secretary
of
state
that
the
agency
denied
the
first
freedom
of
information
request
for
these
documents,
and
it
was
a
secretary
of
state
that
he
by
statue
had
custody
of
the
department's
records,
that
prima
facie
these
records
were
state
department
records
at
all
times
that
he
was
secretary
of
state
and
insofar
as
he
purported
to
transfer
them
to
the
library
of
congress,
they
remained
nevertheless
the
property
of
the
department
of
state
through
the
constructive
possession,
a
phrase
used
by
mr.
geller
earlier
in
the
forsham
case,
the
government
accepts
constructive
possession,
through
the
constructive
possession
of
secretary
kissinger.
accordingly,
very
simply,
these
documents
remained
in
the
possession
and
in
the
control
of
the
department
of
state
at
the
time
when
both
freedom
of
information
requests
were
filed.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
sir,
those
are
personal
records,
by
your
description
of
them.
by
the
description
of
these
records,
however,
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
they
were
agency
records
and
all
flows
from
that
in
our
view.
the
conversations,
after
all,
were
not
held
with
mrs.
kissinger,
they
were
held
with
presidents,
they
were
held
with
foreign
ambassadors,
they
were
held
with
other
officials
of
the
department.
they
were
circulated
to
dr.
kissinger's
immediate
aides,
as
dr.
kissinger's
lawyer
here
has
told
us,
for
the
purpose
of
implementing
and
following
up
the
determinations.
there
is
no
way
in
which
these
could
be
anything
other
than
agency
records.
now,
our
position
is
that
as
secretary
of
state,
henry
kissinger
had
a
duty
to
his
principal,
the
department
of
state,
not
to
prefer
his
own
personal
interests
to
his
principal's
interests.
he
was
aware
from
the
very
beginning,
from
january
of
1976,
when
the
first
freedom
of
information
act
for
any
of
the
records,
those
in
that
case
white
house
records,
were
submitted.
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
these
documents
were
agency
records
or
were
personal
files.
nevertheless,
he
made
the
determination,
a
determination
which
we
submit
was
in
conflict
with
the
interest,
an
interest
he
was
aware
of,
of
the
agency
that
they
were
his
records
and
not
the
agency's
records.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
presidency
has
always
been
considered
a
different
animal.
we
now
have
statutes
that
take
care
of
those
problems.
the
presidential
materials
act
of
1978
will
now
regulate
the
question
of
agency
records
--
for
presidential
records.
this
court
now
has
to
determine
the
status
of
records
of
agency
heads,
cabinet
officers,
because
this
is
a
unique
kind
of
case.
a
subordinate
official
would
not
be
in
the
position
that
the
secretary
of
state
was
in
to
make
the
determination
on
his
own.
a
subordinate
official
would
have
had
to
have
submitted
to
all
the
normal
procedures
that
the
department
of
state
has
in
order
to
get
a
determination
that
the
records
were
personal
records
and
not
state
department
records.
dr.
kissinger
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
will
--
it’s
as
simple
as
this.
the
documents
were
denied.
the
denial
of
documents
creates
a
private
cause
of
action
because
it
is
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
a
withholding.
the
government
makes
a
very
technical
argument
that
the
documents
are
not
in
the
possession
of
the
agency,
there
is
no
withholding.
here
the
possession
of
dr.
kissinger,
the
right
of
access,
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
access
by
right
normal
definitions
of
possession
was
the
possession
of
the
department
of
state.
there
was,
therefore,
in
our
view
a
withholding,
and
therefore,
there
was
a
cause
of
action,
like
any
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
the
statute
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large.
anyone,
any
person,
they
need
not
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
has
a
right
to
seek
access
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
everything
that
happened
here
created
that
cause
of
action.
i
believe
i
have
used
up
my
time.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stevens.
