justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
mr.
ginsburg,
i
take
it
that
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
instead
of
saying
the
library
of
congress
they
were
in
dr.
kissinger's
basement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
really
so
the
fact
that
they
are
in
the
library
of
congress
rather
than
in
his
possession
is
legally
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
what
argument
would
it
make
a
difference
whether
they
are
in
the
library
of
congress
instead
of
in
his
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he
is
not
the
agency,
as
you
make
a
very
good
point.
it
is
the
state
department
and
the
state
department
had
no
control
over
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
so
if
they
are
with
him
instead
of
the
library
of
congress,
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
legal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
because
i
did
think
there
was
a
difference
in
your
theory
in
this
case
and
the
other.
i
thought
your
argument
here
was
that
even
if
they
were
agency
records,
they
had
not
been
withheld
and
therefore
there
was
no
part,
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
they
are
or
are
not
agency
records?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let’s
take
in
to
two
steps.
first
of
all,
assuming
that
some
of
them,
un-extracted
or
something,
some
of
them
are
records
within
the
meaning
of
federal
records
act.
would
they
be
therefore
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
foia
even
though
they
are
at
the
library
of
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
--
that’s
what
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
so
that’s
why
i
am
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
that
it
is
conceivable
we
might
hold.
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
the
government
position
is.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
things
that
may
hold.
i
am
asking
it
very
narrowly
and
very
specifically,
assume
that
there
are
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act,
perhaps
they
are
not
producible
because
they
are
not
being
withheld,
if
they
are
over
at
the
library
of
congress
and
they
are
records
within
the
meaning
of
federal
records
act,
are
they
or
are
they
not
in
the
government’s
view
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
foia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn’t
answer
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
[voice
overlap]
then
why
do
you
make
all
this
long
argument
about
the
federal
records
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
whole
argument
is
completely
unnecessary
to
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
alsup,
you
have
two
right
separate
reasoning.
one
is
there
could
be
no
withholding,
or
two,
it
could
be
because
they
are
not
agency
records,
and
you
keep
muddling
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
saying
that
issue
does
not
depend
on
whether
or
not
they
are
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act,
and
yet
you
have
argued
at
great
length
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act,
as
though,
and
i
had
the
impression
from
your
brief
that
that
would
be
dispositive
in
this
case
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
they
were
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
foia,
but
apparently
i
was
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
alsup,
i
just
want
to
make
one
thing
--
call
one
thing
to
your
attention.
at
page
21
of
your
brief,
you
said.
“we
agree
with
the
courts
below
that
the
foia
applies
to
at
least
all
records
within
the
meaning
of
44
u.s.c.
3301.
you’ve
departed
from
that
position
here.
do
you
think
you
really
mean
to
depart
from
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it
isn’t
qualified
in
your
brief.
you
say
unequivocally,
because
you
argued
no
withholding
first,
you
can
recall
that
in
your
brief,
then
you
say
in
the
summary
of
argument
in
part
two
of
your
brief,
“we
agree
with
the
courts
below
the
foia
applies
to
at
least
all
records
within
the
meaning
of
44
u.s.c.
3301.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
withholding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
you
now
suggest,
we
should
not
accept
this
as
a
literal
statement
of
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
first
argument
was
you
don’t
have
to
decide
what
agency
records
are
because
in
all
events
there
has
been
no
withholding.
your
second
argument
was,
well,
these
are
not
agency
records
because
they
are
not
records
within
the
meaning
of
federal
records
act.
that
was
your
second
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
want
to
withdraw
this
concession,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing.
you
don't
argue
at
all
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
records
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
merely
claim
that
your
rights
under
the
foia
give
you
the
right
to
bring
this
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
was
a
lawless
removal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
opponent
here
argues
that
that
is
in
substance
what
happened
here,
and
i
am
not
saying
he
is
right,
but
he
argues
that
there
was
a
lawless
removal
and
they
were
in
effect
put
in
the
basement
of
the
people
rather
than
kept
and
so
how
is
the
case
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
central
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
do
we
have
to
--
the
question
really
is
do
we
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
was
a
lawless
removal?
you
see,
once
you
concede
that
a
lawless
removal
defeats
--
does
not
defeat
the
foia
request,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
may
have
a
duty
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
a
lawless
removal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ginsburg,
i
don't
mean
to
prolong
it,
but
i
also
don't
want
to
leave
with
a
misunderstanding
of
your
position.
i
think
you
have
agreed
with
me
that
in
the
case
i
pose
if
someone
aware
of
a
pending
request,
takes
all
of
the
documents
home
and
keeps
them
in
his
basement,
that
there
would
be
no
foia
claim
against
that
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
okay.
