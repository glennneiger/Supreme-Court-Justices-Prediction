justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ginsburg,
is
a
legal
adviser
an
appointee
of
the
secretary
of
state
or
of
the
president?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ginsburg,
let
me
go
back
just
a
minute
to
the
point
you
just
made.
supposing
that
dr.
kissinger,
instead
of
disposing
of
the
records
to
the
library
of
congress,
had
sent
them
to
a
private
warehouse
where
he
had
a
warehouse
so
he
could
pick
them
up
any
time
he
wanted
to.
isn't
it
conceivable
under
the
decision
in
bannercraft
that
a
freedom
of
information
act,
the
court
using
it’s
i
believe
what
was
referred
to
as
its
customary
equitable
powers,
could
require
the
warehouse
owner
to
deliver
up
the
records
if
it
concluded
that
they
otherwise
satisfied
the
foia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
dr.
kissinger
had
given
the
entire
records
of
the
state
department
to
the
library
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
have
been
irrevocable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
are
not
records,
you
never
get
any
further,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
between
those
two
positions,
between
saying
(a)
i
choose
to
answer
it,
and
(b)
you
don't
have
to
answer
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
44
u.s.c.
3301,
on
page
5
of
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dobrovir,
suppose
i
am
secretary
of
state
and
i
have
a
file
in
my
office
in
which
i
keep
copies
of
correspondence
to
personal
friends,
which
i
have
written
saying,
no,
i
can't
come
out
and
visit
you
this
week,
but
maybe
two
weeks
from
now,
and
it
is
separate
from
state
department
record
transactions
and
other
things.
are
those
foia
records?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
a
lot
of
presidential
libraries
that
are
in
trouble,
aren't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
one
makes
a
demand
under
--
on
an
agency
for
a
record
which
doesn’t
fall
within
any
of
the
exemptions,
but
which
was
destroyed
lawfully
under
the
federal
records
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
attorney
general
is
the
enforcer
of
that
and
there
have
been
all
sorts
of
cases
deciding
what
is
or
is
not
owned
by
a
person.
isn't
that
ultimately
left
to
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general,
whether
a
record
has
been
unlawfully
removed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
kissinger
case,
henry
kissinger
served
in
the
nixon
and
ford
administrations
from
january
of
1969
through
january
of
1977.
during
those
years,
he
served
first
as
assistant
to
the
president
for
national
security
affairs
and
later
a
secretary
of
state.
throughout
this
period
of
government
service,
kissinger's
secretaries
monitored
his
telephone
calls
and
summaries
of
transcripts
of
the
conversations
were
prepared
and
retained
in
his
personal
files
at
the
state
department.
in
october
of
1976
while
still
secretary
of
state,
kissinger
removed
the
telephone
notes
from
his
office
in
the
state
department
without
first
seeking
the
approval
of
federal
authorities
responsible
for
the
maintenance
and
disposal
of
federal
records.
subsequently
kissinger
entered
into
agreements
with
the
library
of
congress
dating
his
private
papers
including
his
collection
of
telephone
notes.
the
agreements
restrict
public
access
to
the
collection
for
a
number
of
years.
before
kissinger
ended
his
tenure
as
secretary
of
state,
three
separate
freedom
of
information
acts
were
filed
with
the
state
department
seeking
access
to
the
transcripts
of
telephone
conversations
made
by
kissinger
while
acting
either
as
assistant
for
national
security
affairs
and/or
secretary
of
state.
all
three
requests
were
denied
by
the
state
department.
the
first
of
these
request
filed
by
william
safire
sought
access
to
conversations
transcribed
while
kissinger
was
serving
as
assistant
to
the
president.
this
request
was
denied
on
the
grounds
that
the
requested
telephone
notes
were
white
house
records
excluded
from
foia
coverage.
the
other
two
requests
were
denied
because
they
were
filed
with
the
state
department
after
kissinger
had
removed
the
notes
from
the
state
department
office.
the
individuals
and
groups
whose
foia
request
had
been
denied
filed
actions
in
federal
courts
seeking
a
judicial
order
requiring
the
library
to
return
the
telephone
notes
to
the
state
department
with
directions
to
process
them
for
disclosure
under
the
foia.
the
plaintiffs
named
kissinger,
the
library
of
congress,
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
department
of
state
as
defendants.
on
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
access
to
the
telephone
notes
transcribed
while
kissinger
was
secretary
of
state.
the
district
order
of
premises
finding
as
conclusion
that
the
telephone
notes
were
agency
records
as
defined
in
foia
accessible
under
that
act
and
that
kissinger
had
wrongfully
removed
those
records
by
not
obtaining
the
required
approval.
the
court
therefore
held
that
equitable
relief
was
appropriate
under
the
act.
the
court
entered
an
order
denying
plaintiff's
request
however
for
conversations
transcribed
while
kissinger
was
special
assistant
to
the
president.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
and
the
parties
filed
cross-petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
first,
we
reverse
the
order
requiring
the
return
of
the
telephone
notes
made
while
kissinger
was
secretary
of
state.
the
freedom
of
information
act
explicitly
approved
--
provides
the
federal
courts
are
only
authorized
to
order
disclosure
of
requested
materials
when
an
agency
has
improperly
withheld
agency
records.
we
hold
today
that
the
state
department
has
not
withheld
any
documents
from
the
plaintiffs
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
at
the
time
of
the
two
requests,
the
agency
had
neither
the
custody
or
control
necessary
to
enable
it
to
withhold
as
congress
used
that
term.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
however
in
its
judgment
denying
access
to
telephone
notes
transcribed
while
kissinger
served
assistant
to
the
president.
the
act
provides
that
records
of
the
executive
officer
of
the
president
are
not
available
to
the
public
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
properly
characterized
the
safire
request
as
seeking
access
only
to
white
house
records
excluded
from
the
act's
coverage.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
and
dissenting
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
marshall
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
justice
blackmun
did
not
participate
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
