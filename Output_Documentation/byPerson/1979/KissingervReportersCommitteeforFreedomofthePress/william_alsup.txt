mr.
william
alsup
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
respondents'
threshold
submission
is
the
same
as
dr.
kissinger's
threshold
submission,
and
that
is
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
not
require
an
agency
to
retrieve
documents
it
once
possessed,
but
no
longer
possesses
at
the
time
a
request
is
made
under
the
foia.
that
submission,
if
correct,
is
dispositive
of
the
case
--
mr.
william
alsup
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
it’s
a
combination
in
response
to
a
comment
that
justice
stevens
made.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
it’s
because
the
agency
cannot
withhold
what
it
does
not
possess,
and
we
also
think
that
the
word
"withhold"
and
made
available
lends
meaning
to
the
words
"agency
records."
mr.
william
alsup
well
--
mr.
william
alsup
no.
i
take
the
same
position,
and
the
position
is
that
these
words
modify
each
other
and
that
you
have
to
look
at
that
entire
sentence
in
its
totality
to
see
that
what
congress
said
was
that
the
agency
has
to
turn
over
those
documents
that
are
under
its
possession
and
control.
that’s
what
it
meant
by
agency
record
and
that’s
what
it
meant
by
withhold,
and
we
don't
really
see
any
useful
purpose
in
trying
to
distinguish
between
in
parts,
the
sentence
is
very
narrow,
and
say
this
might
be
an
agency
record,
but
it
is
not
being
withheld
because
it
is
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
we
do
make
the
further
distinction
concerning
whether
or
not
a
document
is
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
with
the
modification
or
not
even
modification
with
commerce
that
i
have
made
up,
we
accept
that
statement.
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
i
believe
that
is
correct.
well,
if
the
--
our
primary
submission
is
dispositive
even
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
these
secretarial
notes
were
records
under
the
federal
records
act
which
is
an
entirely
different
scheme
and
we
think
that
primary
submission
is
dispositive
and
the
court
doesn't
even
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
record
under
the
state
department
records
management
program.
contrary
to
our
primary
submission,
however,
the
courts
below
held
that
the
foia
does
require
an
agency
to
retrieve
those
documents
that
no
longer
possesses
where
it
used
to
be
or
may
still
be
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act.
now,
in
the
event
the
court,
this
court
rejects
our
primary
submission,
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
analysis
used
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
concerning
what
is
and
is
not
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act
and
it
is
to
this
question
of
what
is
and
is
not
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act
with
the
court’s
permission
that
i
would
like
to
turn.
mr.
william
alsup
no.
i
will
make
sure
i
understand
your
question.
are
you
referring
to
agency
records
within
the
foia
or
within
the
federal
records
act?
mr.
william
alsup
that
is
a
difficult
question
and
i
know
we
have
stumbled
over
perhaps,
but
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
first,
there
would
be
no
withholding
because
the
--
mr.
william
alsup
i
think
that
is
clear
to
everyone
that
agrees
we
are
making
that
argument.
mr.
william
alsup
we
also
think
that
the
word
“withholding”
and
“made
available”
lend
meaning
to
what
congress
meant
by
agency
record
which
appears
in
that
same
sentence,
and
therefore,
it’s
conceivable
that
the
court
might
also
hold
at
least
the
same
documents
[voice
overlap]
are
agency
records.
mr.
william
alsup
alright,
if
they
are
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act,
they
remain
federal
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act
even
though
they
are
at
the
library
of
congress.
now
--
mr.
william
alsup
i
know,
i
know.
your
question
is
whether
or
not
they
are
agency
records
within
the
meaning
of
foia?
mr.
william
alsup
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
our
argument
is
that
they
are
not
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
foia,
even
though
i
do
not
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue
because
of
the
clear
availability
of
the
word
“withhold.”
mr.
william
alsup
well,
because
--
mr.
william
alsup
i
disagree
with
that.
the
court
below
found
it
very
important
that
these
were
records
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
records
act.
mr.
william
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
no,
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
if
i
may,
we
clearly
argue
and
i
think
i
haven't
said
this
very
well,
but
we
are
clearly
taking
the
position
that
whether
or
not
it
is
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act
or
under
justice
stevens'
possibility
that
agency
records
mean
something
special
in
the
foia,
if
the
agency
does
not
have
possession
and
control
---
wait,
let
me
finish
this,
if
the
agency
doesn't
have
possession
and
control,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
foia.
possession
and
control
is
an
essential
requirement
before
the
agency
is
required
to
produce
under
the
foia.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
don't
think
i
am
able
to
give
much
clearer
answer
than
what
i
have.
as
i
understand
our
argument,
first
there
would
be
no
withholding.
mr.
william
alsup
and
you
agree
with
that.
second,
this
may
or
may
not
be
agency
records.
we
don't
think
it
is
necessary
under
the
foia,
we
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
determine
that
issue.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
no.
we
believe
that
an
agency
is
required
to
produce
under
the
foia
any
document
which
is
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act
and
is
in
its
possession
and
control.
now,
let's
go
over
those
three
elements,
a
record
under
the
fra,
possession,
and
control.
if
any
of
those
three
are
missing,
then
the
agency
does
not
have
to
produce
it
and
there
is
no
withholding.
now,
it
is
a
separate
question
and
a
nice
question,
but
we
think
a
theoretical
question
as
to
whether
or
not
agency
record
means
something,
that
if
it
is
not
in
its
possession
and
control
it
continues
to
be
an
agency
record,
and
i
think
where
i
haven't
been
very
clear
is
that
i
am
simply
saying
i
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
an
issue
in
this
case
whether
a
document
is
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act,
however,
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
william
alsup
that's
right.
mr.
william
alsup
well
--
mr.
william
alsup
well
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
that's
correct.
it
is
not
inconsistent
and
i
understood
mr.
geller
to
say
that
you
don't
have
to
make
a
distinction
between
what
is
and
is
not
an
agency
record
because
the
word
"withhold"
and
"made
available"
in
agency
records
should
all
be
read
together.
but
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that
submission.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
were
or
were
not
records
under
the
federal
records
act
because
that
was
the
question
which
was
of
great
concern
in
the
courts
below
and
they
concluded
that
they
were
records
under
the
federal
records
act.
we
think
that
the
district
court
made
a
fundamental
error
in
deciding
for
itself
what
is
and
is
not
a
record
under
the
federal
records
act.
mr.
william
alsup
that's
correct.
that
was
first
enacted
in
the
records
disposal
act,
and
that
same
definition
that
was
in
1943,
that
same
definition
was
then
incorporated
into
the
federal
records
act
in
1950.
mr.
william
alsup
that's
correct.
in
fact,
the
court
could
simply
hold
that
the
act
does
not
reach
documents
which
are
not
in
the
possession
of
the
agency.
mr.
william
alsup
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
this
secondary
issue
would
only
be
reached
in
the
event
the
court
were
to
say
there
is
a
duty
to
retrieve
documents
which
are
records
under
the
federal
records
act.
the
definition
under
33
--
section
3301
defines
a
record
to
be
one
which
is
preserved
among
other
things
and
only
to
be
those
things
which
are
preserved
or
appropriate
for
preservation
as
evidence
of
the
organization,
functions,
policies,
decisions,
procedures,
operations
or
other
activities
of
the
government.
we
think
the
words
"appropriate
for
preservation"
there
is
the
key.
the
district
court
underscored
that
language
in
its
opinion,
indicating
that
it
felt
that
these
notes
were
appropriate
for
preservation.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
the
agency,
not
the
courts,
which
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
something
is
appropriate
for
preservation
as
a
record.
under
the
federal
records
act,
the
scheme
that
is
contemplated
is
that
agencies
will
adopt
records
management
programs
and
they
will
make
the
decision
in
the
first
instance
whether
some
material
should
or
should
not
become
an
agency
record
and
thereby
--
or
federal
record
and
thereby
subject
to
the
strictures
of
the
records
disposal
act
which
prohibit
any
disposal
of
such
a
record
without
the
approval
of
the
archivist.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
not
designated
as
a
record,
it
remains
non-record
material,
and
even
though
that
is
the
property
of
the
united
states
in
our
view,
it
is
not
a
federal
record.
now,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
and
the
courts
below
disregarded
this
approach
to
the
act
by
simply
assuming
that
these
documents
were
records
under
the
federal
records
act
without
making
an
inquiry
into
the
state
department's
regulations
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
agency
itself
had
classified
them
as
records
on
the
one
hand
or
non-record
materials
on
the
other.
we
do
agree,
however,
with
the
district
court
that
these
documents,
when
they
were
created,
were
not
the
personal
property
of
dr.
kissinger,
but
were
the
property
of
the
agency.
they
may
have
been
non-record
material
or
they
may
have
been
records,
but
the
agency
would
make
that
determination
by
applying
its
records
management
program.
if
we
accept
that
analysis
of
the
federal
records
act,
we
believe
that
a
remand
to
the
district
court
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
particular
notes
were
or
were
not
non-record
material
or
were
or
were
not,
to
put
it
conversely,
records
under
the
federal
records
act.
mr.
william
alsup
not
principally.
the
principle
determinant
under
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
is
whether
or
not
they
were
prepared
within
the
scope
of
employment
of
the
employee,
and
here
that
clearly
was
the
case.
these
were
--
with
the
possible
exception
of
those
notes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
department's
business,
but
the
bulk
of
these
would
have
been
clearly
prepared
in
the
scope
of
dr.
kissinger's
employment
and
that
would
have
made
them
the
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
alsup
not
necessarily
and
in
some
cases
a
nice
question
would
be
presented
whether
or
not
something
like
that
was
made
within
the
scope
of
employment.
for
example,
if
the
president
had
written
a
letter
and
to
a
personal
friend,
i
think
most
people
would
agree
that
is
not
within
scope
of
an
employment.
there
are
intermediate
cases
that
are
in
the
gray
area
where
it
is
not
as
clear.
mr.
william
alsup
not
necessarily.
again,
the
test
would
be
whether
or
not
the
active
writing
a
letter
was
something
that
would
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
am
sorry.
whether
that
act
could
have
been
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
william
alsup
the
conversation
itself
would
be,
but
whether
or
not
in
the
late
hours
in
the
evening
if
the
president
dictates
the
tape
about
that
day’s
events
that’s
not
necessarily
within
the
scope
when
the
president’s
role
as
president.
it
might
be,
that’s
perhaps
much
tougher
case
than
we
have
now,
but
these
were
clearly,
in
the
present
case
dr.
kissinger
just
notes
were
clearly
prepared
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
as
a
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.
william
alsup
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
were
personal
property
when
created.
we
believe
that
the
legal
adviser
was
incorrect.
we
believe
that
those
were
the
property
of
the
agency.
we
do,
however,
accept
that
part
of
the
legal
adviser’s
opinion
which
seemed
to
say
that
at
the
end
of
the
usefulness
of
those
notes,
after
the
extracts
were
prepared
if
it
were
properly
prepared
then
because
there
would
non
record
material
under
the
record
management
program,
the
agency
would
be
free
to
disposed
of
that
property
by
allowing
dr.
kissinger
to
retain
it.
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
let’s
take
an
extreme
--
more
extreme
case.
let’s
say
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
that
by
saying
what
if
dr.
kissinger
had
given
all
of
the
records
of
the
state
department
to
the
library
of
congress.
well,
clearly
on
the
case
like
that.
even
if
the
legal
adviser
had
somehow
approved
that
the
state
department
would
want
to
bring
every
retrieval
action
and
say
we
changed
our
mind.
the
legal
adviser
no
longer
believes
that
these
were
the
personal
property
of
dr.
kissinger,
but
rather
that
these
were
the
property
of
the
agency
itself.
we
do
believe
that
the
agency
itself
can
change
its
mind
in
go
after
--
mr.
william
alsup
so
far
as
this
record
discloses,
the
state
department
has
not
made
a
final
determination
whether
to
bring
a
retrieval
action
for
the
recovery
of
the
notes
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
it
has
not
asked
for
them
back.
in
the
record
there
is
an
agreement
--
mr.
william
alsup
yes.
mr.
william
alsup
no.
no,
the
procedure
that
now
is
outstanding
is
that
there
is
an
agreement
with
dr.
kissinger
and
the
federal
parties
that
allows
a
sampling
of
these
documents
to
be
undertaken
for
the
state
department
to
make
a
determination
whether
it
believes
some
of
these
are
or
are
not
records.
when
that
is
completed,
if
the
state
department
has
decided
that
these
were
records
on
the
records
management
program,
and
at
that
time
that
would
take
appropriate
action
to
seek
to
return
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
it
might
have
either
alternative.
mr.
william
alsup
the
state
department
specifically
would
like
to
reserve
both
possibilities
and
we
don’t
take
the
position
as
to
whether
--
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
these
are
or
are
not
records.
mr.
william
alsup
that’s,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
once
they
were
back
--
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct.
once
they
are
back
in
the
possession
of
this
--
mr.
william
alsup
i
--
mr.
justice,
the
problem
is
this.
the
state
department
does
not
know
what
these
documents
look
like.
they
have
not
seen,
but
a
limited
sample,
and
it
is
simply
not
in
the
position
at
this
point
to
draw
a
conclusion
which
would
reverse
the
position
that
the
legal
adviser
took.
mr.
william
alsup
not
necessarily,
that
might
be
done
at
the
library
of
congress.
mr.
william
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
at
the
time
of
the
district
court’s
order
an
agreement
was
filed
with
the
court
which
advised
the
court
that
federal
parties
were
making
an
inspection
of
the
a
limited
sample
of
the
notes
at
the
library
of
congress
and
that
they,
therefore,
would
make
a
decision
at
some
point
in
the
future
when
that
review
was
completed
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
department
felt
that
any
of
these
were
records
and
would
therefore
seek
the
return.
mr.
william
alsup
it
would
not
dispose.
even
if
the
state
department
were
to
say
that
they
wanted
some
small
percentage
in
the
documents
back,
we
are
convinced
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
in
this
case
would
insist
on
full
return,
it
would
not
dispose
of
the
case.
mr.
william
alsup
all
records
within
the
meaning
of
3301
which
are
in
the
possession
and
custody
of
--
mr.
william
alsup
now,
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
fair
construction.
mr.
justice,
for
this
reason.
we
made
a
very
clear
in
our
first
argument
that
possession
and
control
is
a
sine
qua
non
of
--
mr.
william
alsup
of
withholding
and
of
whether
--
well,
perhaps
we
didn’t
make
it
as
clear
as
the
oral
argument
now
should
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
it’s
the
second
of
our
argument,
that
we
meant
to
say
about
that,
that
of
course,
that
applies
only
to
those
records
which
are
in
the
possession
and
control
of
the
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
rather
than
--
mr.
william
alsup
we
will
stand
by
whatever
we
said
in
our
brief,
so
i
don’t
want
anything
i
have
interpreted
to
be
a
concession
from
the
statements
that
we
have
made
and
either
our
forsham
brief
or
the
kissinger
brief.
thank
you.
