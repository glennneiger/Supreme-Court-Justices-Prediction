well,
couldn't
we
say
the
case
before
us
is
the
taxing
of
commodities?
justice

right.
justice

so
that
would
include
tires,
batteries,
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
that
is
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
yet
you
say
the
only
thing
we
can
decide
is
the
tobacco.
couldn't
we
decide
that
the
indians
could
tax
all
commodities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
you
are
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
commodities
you
say
would
be
limited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all,
a-l-l.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
noting
in
"all"
that
is
limited,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
limited
and
a
minute
ago
you
said
that
the
indians
could
tax
all
commodities.
