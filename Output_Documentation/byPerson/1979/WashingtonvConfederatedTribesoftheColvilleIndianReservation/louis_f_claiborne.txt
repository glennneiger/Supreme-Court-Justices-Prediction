mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
before
attempting
to
join
them
back
together,
it
might
be
useful
if
i
sought
to
unravel
the
several
strands
of
the
argument
as
we
see
it
on
this
side.
without
pretending
that
any
single
one
of
these
arguments
is
sufficient
to
carry
the
day,
it
is
in
our
submission
useful
to
look
at
three
arguments
that
when
joined
do
in
our
submission
justify
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
i
identify
them
first
as
the
territorial
principle;
secondly,
as
the
commercial
principle;
and
thirdly
is
the
governmental
principle,
somewhat
arbitrary
titles
for
the
purpose.
but
the
territorial
idea
is
one
which,
of
course,
dates
from
the
very
earliest
cases
in
this
court
dealing
with
indian
tribes.
it
is
basically
the
notion
that
only
in
exceptional
circumstances,
as
this
court
repeated
only
last
term,
may
state
law
or
state
taxes
invade
that
area
which
has
been
reserved
to
the
continuing
sovereignty
of
the
tribe
albeit
in
a
most
limited
way.
and
the
question
therefore
is
whether
this
case,
this
tax
or
these
taxes
fall
within
that
exception,
not
the
other
way
around.
the
burden
is
not
on
the
tribe
to
show
that
this
particular
tax
would
normally
apply
but
for
reasons
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
it
does
not.
the
burden
is
very
much
on
the
state
to
justify
the
intrusion
of
its
laws,
its
taxes
within
an
area
still
separate
in
some
meaningful
sense.
now,
that
principle
is
not
only
an
old
one,
it
is
one
which
has
been
reiterated
as
recently
as
wheeler.
it
is
a
principle
which
has
been
the
basis
for
distinguishing
between
activities
on
and
off
reservation,
including
cases
in
the
tax
area,
noticeably
the
mescalero
opinion
in
411
u.s.
reports.
i
suggest
that
the
result
in
that
case
in
respect
of
the
sales
tax
or
gross
profits
tax
would
have
been
different
had
that
ski
enterprise
been
on
rather
than
off
the
reservation,
and
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
as
i
read
it
is
the
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
immunity
has
its
limits
its
geographic
limits
and
cannot
be
imported
beyond
the
limits
of
the
reservation
or
exported
and,
of
course,
there
is
no
attempt
to
do
so
in
this
case.
there
is,
of
course,
a
giving
way
of
reservation
boundaries
over
the
years
with
the
opening
up
policy
which
results
in
non-indians
living
on
the
reservation,
but
that
historic
fact
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
modern
change
of
fact
which
requires
a
change
of
law
because
the
yakima
reservation
is
inhabited
by
a
substantial
non-indian
population.
we
are
dealing
with
indian
trade
which
has
been
going
on
since
the
beginning
in
which
the
white
man
sells
to
the
indian
and
vice
versa.
instead
of
dealing
with
furs
or
with
other
skins
or
with
horses
or
with
tobacco
in
its
raw
form,
we
now
deal
with
cigarettes
and
the
principle
ought
to
be
the
same.
of
course,
it
matters
what
the
effect
of
the
state's
intrusion
is.
if
it
is
law,
if
it
is
tax,
it
impinges
only
on
the
non-indian
residents
or
the
non-indian
while
on
the
reservation,
that
is
permissible.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
the
effect
is
not
indirect,
it
is
not
remote,
it
is
not
minimal.
it
destroys
a
tribal
enterprise
and
it
is
a
tribal
enterprise
and
not
a
private
one.
with
those
remarks,
i
turn
to
the
second
aspect
which
is
the
burden
which
this
state
tax
places
on
the
economy.
simply
to
illustrate
than
there
is
such
a
principle
and
indeed
a
constitutional
principle
which
derives
directly
from
the
indian
commerce
clause,
when
we
only
posit
a
state
law
which
prohibited
implementation,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
into
the
state
of
washington
of
products
grown
or
manufactured
on
the
yakima
reservation,
such
a
law
would
be
manifestly
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
indian
commerce
clause
and
so
would
the
reverse,
a
prohibition
on
the
exportation
of
products
into
an
indian
reservation.
now,
of
course,
that
is
not
this
case
but
simply
illustrates
that
the
indian
commerce
clause
has,
like
the
other
aspects
of
the
commerce
clause,
a
self-executing
force
which
may
be
relevant
to
this
case.
here
we
deal
with
state
taxes
which
not
only
burden
the
commerce
between
indian
and
non-indian
but
which
in
this
respect
destroy
it,
utterly.
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
sales
taxes
as
applied
to
furniture
and
other
manufacture
did
not
have
that
effect,
that
the
effect
was
not
demonstrated
and
presumptively
minimal
and
accordingly
did
not
invalidate
those
taxes.
here
the
combined
effect
of
the
state
excise
and
sales
tax
on
cigarettes
admittedly
destroyed
that
commerce.
that
effect,
it
seems
to
us,
implicates
the
indian
commerce
clause.
now,
finally
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
we
look
at
the
governmental
aspects
of
the
case
and
here
the
great
distinction
between
this
case
and
moe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
if
forced
to
an
answer,
i
think
i
would
probably
would
say
that.
i
would
stress
that
this
is
not
a
use
tax
imposed
only
on
the
use
of
the
cigarettes
once
they
have
left
the
reservation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
i
appreciate
the
hypothetical,
but
it
is
a
hypothetical.
it
isn't
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
tax
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
thought
i
said,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
compelled
to
an
answer,
but
emphasizing
the
difference
between
your
hypothetical
and
the
case
before
the
court,
i
would
argue
that
they
both
fall
because
of
the
effect
on
not
merely
the
commerce
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
and
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
i
recognize
that
that
is
so
and
that
that
too
might
have
the
same
effect.
many
things
may
have
the
same
effect
without
being
equally
subject
to
challenge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
that
instance
--
and
i
am
not
clear,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
whether
the
enterprise
of
manufacturing
the
cars
in
your
hypothetical
is
done
by
the
tribe
or
by
some
entrepreneur
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
perhaps
an
important
difference
there,
but
that
case
it
seems
to
me
would
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
that
is
that
we
could
not
invalidate
washington's
tax
in
those
circumstances,
there
being
no
collision
between
the
tax
imposed
by
the
tribe,
there
being
none
in
your
hypothetical,
and
that
imposed
by
the
state.
there
are
gradations,
but
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
other
extreme
it
seems
absurd
perhaps
that
washington
would
claim
its
right
to
tax
even
the
most
traditional
indian
artifacts
that
are
used
on
the
reservation
which
would
not
otherwise
come
into
commerce
at
all,
and
yet
the
attorney
general
was
quite
clear
that
he
would
apply
the
same
rule
to
that
situation.
it
may
be
that
the
tribes,
though
every
incentive
leads
them
to
self-restraint
--
after
all,
they
must
live
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
the
state,
with
state
officials
in
washington
state
law,
for
the
most
part
applies
on
their
reservations,
there
must
be
a
modus
vivendi.
it
is
not
in
their
interests
to
press
their
advantage
if
it
is
legally
recognized
to
the
extreme.
but
should
they
unwisely
attempt
to
do
so,
the
remedy
in
my
submission
lies
with
congress
and
congress
would
undoubtedly
be
pretty
receptive
to
any
indication
that
the
tribes
were
abusing
their
privilege
in
such
a
way
as
seriously
to
detract
from
important
state
revenues.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
indeed,
many
other
states
have
taken
the
opposite
view
of
these
reservation
smoke
shop
operations.
we
are
told
amici
in
this
case
that
nevada
and
florida
expressly
condone
the
claim
of
the
tribes
to
be
exempted
from
sales
and
excise
taxes
on
their
sales
of
cigarettes
to
non-indians.
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
so
held.
i
am
further
informed
that
arizona
takes
the
same
view.
indeed,
so
does
wisconsin
and
new
mexico.
that
is
the
pattern.
washington
is
the
exception.
it
apparently
is
a
system
with
which
most
of
the
states
have
been
content
to
live
and
some
expressly
recognize
that
this
small
effort
by
the
tribes
to
become
self-sustaining
is
lawful,
ought
not
to
be
interfered
with
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
can't
say
that
there
has
been
sufficiently
accurate
or
adequate
investigation
of
the
various
state
laws.
this
information
is
for
the
most
part
contained
in
briefs
filed
in
this
case
amicus
curiae.
i
have
supplemented
it
insofar
as
i
have
mentioned
new
mexico,
wisconsin
and
arizona.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
i
am
not
suggesting,
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
haven't
said
before
that
in
each
of
these
cases
there
is
a
tribal
tax
but
that
there
is
a
cigarette
business
and
in
each
of
these
states
the
state
though
imposing
an
excise
tax
generally
does
not
impose
that
tax
on
sales
to
non-indians
occurring
within
the
reservation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
on
a
very
close
boundary
except
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
--
there
is
another
distinction
between
that
case,
between
this
case
and
moe
which
is
that
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
governmental
operation
not
only
in
the
sense
that
the
tribe
taxes
but
that
the
tribe
regulates
everything,
including
price.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so,
the
yakima
nation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
a
tribal
wholesale
enterprise.
the
ordinance
requires
that
a
uniform
price
be
fixed
by
the
dealers
and
presumptively
if
they
don't,
if
they
fail
to
agree
the
state
will
impose
it
and
it
limits
the
number
of
outlets,
it
requires
that
each
of
them
qualify
and
it
requires
that
they
be
subject
to
continuing
regulation
and
annual
renewal
of
their
licenses.
it
is
a
rather
strict
regulatory
scheme
of
tax
of
the
enterprise
even
at
the
retail
level.
