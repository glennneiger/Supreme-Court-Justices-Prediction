mr.
gorton,
just
so
i
understand
it,
if
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
had
fallen
on
the
retailer,
the
indian
retailer,
it
would
clearly
be
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
gorton
is
the
extent
of
the
competitive
advantage
significant
in
your
argument?
now,
apparently
there
is
both
an
excise
tax
and
a
sales
tax,
and
is
the
same
argument
applicable
to
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
extent
of
the
competitive
advantage
really
isn't
critical
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
argument
apply
to
retail
sales
by
indians
of,
say,
things
they
might
make
on
the
reservation,
artifacts
or
souvenirs
or
things
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
non-indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
gorton,
i
suppose
the
parallel
would
be
could
great
britain
require
the
united
states
retailer
to
keep
a
lot
of
records
to
do
the
regulating
necessary
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
really
the
problem
because
there
is
no
doubt
about
your
power
to
impede
the
tax.
you
impose
the
tax
if
they
buy
it
over
in
oregon,
too,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
you
impose
the
tax?
maybe
you
couldn't
collect
it,
but
you
could
impose
it.
your
british
analogy
is
a
good
one
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
furniture
shops
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
those
limitations,
wouldn't
they
be
affected
by
the
number
of
cartons
you
permitted
them
to
purchase?
if
you
win
this
case,
why
couldn't
the
tribe
say,
well,
instead
of
a
three-carton
limit,
we
will
have
a
ten-carton
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
same
problem
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
expressed
about
why
is
that
legally
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
you
characterize
the
economic
situation
in
saving
$200
or
$300
on
the
sales
tax
on
an
automobile
as
an
illogical
conclusion.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
perfectly
logical
conclusion
and
your
argument
should
apply
equally
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
gorton,
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
view
the
issues
on
the
motor
vehicle
excise
tax
scheme
--
that
is
still
before
us,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
haven't
talked
about
them
very
much
this
morning,
but
aren't
they
essentially
the
same
as
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
not
the
typical
use
tax
that
is
paid,
a
one-time
tax
in
connection
with
the
transaction,
isn't
it
an
annual
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
its
economic
incidence,
i
take
it,
is
precisely
the
same
as
a
personal
property
tax?
it
is
based
on
the
percentage
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
vehicle,
rather
than
so
much
on
the
horsepower
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
same
way
in
which
the
tax
which
is
collected
from
non-indians
on
motor
vehicles
is
characterized?
