justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
gorton,
would
the
reaching
of
the
majority
allow
an
indian
automobile
franchise
on
the
reservation
to
sell
new
automobiles
and
prevent
the
state
of
washington
from
collecting
a
use
tax
if
those
automobiles
were
used
outside
of
the
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
it
make
any
difference
to
your
argument
if
the
state
of
washington
had
adopted
a
tax
of
a
dollar
a
load
upon
bread
and
the
indian
tribes
on
their
lands
sold
the
bread
tax-free?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
tax?
i
am
talking
about
a
tax
on
sales
--
supposing
instead
of
smoke
shops
on
the
reservations,
the
indians
had
bread
shops.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
claiming
that
the
basis
for
your
exemption
here
is
constitutional,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
footnote
17
in
moe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
mcclanahan
make
the
statement
that
we
had
moved
from
an
era
of
automatic
lines
between
constitutional
and
unconstitutional
to
a
less
sovereign
and
more
preemptive
type
of
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
furniture
store,
the
automobile
dealership?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
theoretical
principle
separates
a
furniture
store
or
an
automobile
dealership
on
the
one
hand
from
a
smoke
shop
on
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
theoretical
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
joined
by
one
other
justice
in
that
opinion,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
can
get
so
many
people
to
come
to
buy
three
cigarettes,
couldn't
you
get
an
awful
lot
more
to
come
to
buy
a
new
chevrolet
if
it
is
tax
free?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
state
of
washington
levy
a
sales
tax
on
new
cars?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
issue
before
the
court,
the
issue
of
the
sale
trucks
that
go
through
washington
to
the
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
district
court
didn't
reach
it
because
it
struck
down
the
tax
on
interstate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
of
washington
simply
stated
or
stationed
tax
collectors
on
the
washington
side
of
the
boundary
between
the
reservation
and
the
state
of
washington
and
inspected
cars
coming
off
the
reservation,
and
if
they
bought
cartons
of
cigarettes
on
the
reservation
they
would
impose
a
use
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
indians
went
into
the
business
of
manufacturing
automobiles
and
made
automobiles
which
they
sold
to
the
public,
didn't
tax
them
at
all,
but
the
state
of
washington
imposed
an
excise
tax
on
them,
would
you
say
that
the
fact
that
the
state
of
washington's
excise
tax
was
enough
to
ruin
the
margin
of
profit
that
the
indians
had
been
making
before
they
imposed
the
tax
fall,
even
though
collected
as
a
use
tax
outside
the
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
the
tribe.
