justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
you
answered
brother
stevens
that
if
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
indian
seller,
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
illegal
or
unconstitutional
or
what?
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
is
it
preemption
or
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
understand
the
legal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
from
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
be
a
wrong
statement,
that
absent
some
federal
statute
expressly
permitting
such
a
tax,
it
is
forbidden?
is
that
a
brand
preemption?
it
might
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
it
is
preempted
by
some
--
by
a
pattern
of
federal
statutes
and
treaties?
justice
byron
r.
white
preemption
in
the
sense
of
conflict
or
just
occupying
the
field?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
is
an
expression
of
congressional
consent
that
in
light
of
the
existing
statutes
there
shouldn't
be
any
state
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
anderson,
there
are
extensions
in
some
other
reservations,
aren't
there,
around
the
country,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
ski
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
off
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
some
other
areas,
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
hotels,
inns?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
the
tribe
taxed
those,
you
would
make
the
same
argument,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
tribes
levied
exactly
the
same
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
was
a
dealership
on
the
reservation
and
the
tribe
levied
an
equal
tax
on
the
sales
of
new
cars
to
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
all
justice
rehnquist
has
been
asking,
isn't
it,
whether
the
same
principle
would
apply
if
you
had
a
tribal
tax
on
sales
of
new
cars.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
we
could
say
this
may
not
apply
to
new
cars?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
regardless
of
whether
there
is
an
indian
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
request
to
reargue
montana,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
colleague
from
the
three
tribes
agrees
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
you
would
emphasize
enforcement
if
the
state
could
collect
at
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
may
they
make
the
indian
seller
collect?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
because
collection
at
the
border
of
the
reservation
from
the
buyer
would
have
the
same
impact,
the
tax
collected
that
way
would
be
too
burdensome?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
washington
law
is
that
we
impose
on
the
buyer
a
tax
when
he
buys
cigarettes
and
they
just
collect
it
from
him
at
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
that
is
a
fine
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
state
could
repeal
it,
its
own
sales
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
just
on
cigarettes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
solid
statistical
basis
for
saying
one
is
a
pattern
and
the
other
is
the
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
with
respect
to
some
of
the
states
that
don't
attempt
to
collect
its
own
tax,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
is
a
tribal
tax
or
not,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
without
the
tax
that
washington
would
be
out
of
bounds
here,
without
the
tribal
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
be
covered
by
moe
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
yakima
nation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
tribal
enterprise?
