mr.
steven
s.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
washington
in
these
proceedings
contends
for
a
radical
principle,
the
principle
that
it
has
the
power
to
effectively
preempt
and
eliminate
tribal
taxation
of
indian
commerce
on
trust
land
within
the
external
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
commerce
is
already
taxed
by
the
tribe,
the
governing
body
of
the
situs
where
this
indian
commerce
between
indians
and
non-indians
takes
place.
our
contention
is
that
the
state's
attempt
to
apply
its
tax
laws
is
an
attempt
to
appropriate
to
itself
tax
revenues
which
more
properly
belong
to
the
indian
tribes
which
is
the
governing
body
of
the
situs
of
this
commerce.
although
mr.
gorton
tires
to
tell
this
court
that
this
is
a
tax
immunity
case,
that
is
not
true.
this
is
not
so.
this
is
not
moe.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
tribe
is
levying
its
own
tax
and
using
those
tax
revenues
for
essential
governmental
purposes.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
am
addressing
right
now
the
cigarette
tax,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
no
contention
by
the
tribes
in
our
case
regarding
the
sales
tax
and
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
colville
case.
the
real
issue
here
is
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
which
of
two
inconsistent
and
incompatible
tax
laws
can
be
applied
to
these
reservation
transactions
when
it
is
not
possible
for
the
two
systems
to
peacefully
coexist.
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
case
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
there
can
be
no
survival
of
the
tribal
taxing
systems
if
the
state
tax
is
superimposed
on
the
tribal
tax
that
is
already
levied
on
these
goods.
if
the
state
succeeds
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
yes,
i
am
talking
about
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
i
think
williams
v.
lee
was
a
practical
test
and
i
think
the
imposition
of
state
law
in
this
case
ought
to
be
judged
by
its
practical
effects.
it
is
clear
that
this
protected
commerce
between
indians
and
non-indians,
constitutionally
protected
commerce
if
the
state
imposes
this
tax
will
be
subjected
to
multiple
burdens.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
we
make
that
argument
as
well,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
footnote
17
in
moe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
stated
that
--
it
was
talking
about
the
issue
in
mcclanahan,
whether
or
not
state
tax
laws
could
be
applied
to
indians
on
the
reservation,
and
the
court
said
that
the
mcclanahan
decision
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
automatic
exemption
and
that
is,
of
course,
clear
because
in
mcclanahan
the
court
looked
to
the
specific
federal
statutes
rather
than
the
united
states
constitution
to
find
the
preemption.
but
the
issue
of
a
tax
that
directly
and
substantially
interferes
with
tribal
self-government
was
not
presented
in
mcclanahan
and
l
do
not
read
that
footnote
in
moe
to
have
disposed
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
not
before
it.
we
do
contend
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
indian
commerce
clause
was
to
provide
protection
for
tribal
self-government
and
a
tax
--
williams
v.
lee,
after
all,
is
in
part
a
constitutional
test.
you
will
remember
that
the
court
in
williams
said
that
the
question
was
whether
absent
governing
laws
of
congress,
state
law
could
impermissibly
interfere
with
tribal
self-government
and
this
court
in
williams
also
recognized
that
the
holding
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
worcester
was
also
a
constitutional
holding.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
mcclanahan
did
say,
your
honor,
that
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine
was
the
backdrop
and
not
the
dispositive
principle.
but
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
was
that
the
worcester
principle
originally
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall
had
been
somewhat
modified.
originally,
as
the
opinion
in
worcester
makes
clear,
the
court
treated
indian
reservations
at
that
time
as
a
virtual
island,
a
boundary
of
which
state
law
could
not
cross
under
any
circumstances.
and
in
mcclanahan
the
court
noted
that
in
situations
where
tribal
governments
were
not
affected
and
the
rights
of
indians
were
not
affected,
state
law
could
be
applied
to
non-indians.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
in
williams
made
clear,
and
as
well
in
mcclanahan,
that
the
basic
holding
of
worcester,
the
basic
constitutional
holding
still
remained
intact
in
situations
where
essential
governmental
relations,
essential
tribal
relations
were
involved.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
moe
footnote
can
or
should
be
read
to
eliminate
a
line
of
constitutional
argument
that
was
not
even
at
issue
and
before
the
court
in
moe.
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
practical
impact
of
the
imposition
of
this
state
tax
will
be
to
totally
destroy
the
tribes'
ability
to
tax
in
the
situation.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
one
of
the
results
of
imposition
of
the
state
taxes
will
be
the
elimination
of
the
essential
tax
revenues
needed
by
these
tribal
programs,
needed
for
the
financing
of
these
tribal
programs.
in
addition,
the
court
found
that
a
result
of
the
imposition
of
these
taxes
would
be
forced
relinquishment
of
these
critically
needed
tribal
programs.
now,
ultimately
the
principle
that
the
state
contends
for
here
is
that
the
indian
tribe
would
have
no
ability
whatsoever
to
tax
transactions
on
the
reservation
that
are
already
being
taxed
by
the
state.
by
the
same
token,
an
indian
tribe,
if
the
state's
principle
is
granted,
would
be
committing
economic
suicide
if
it
also
attempts
to
tax
transactions
in
which
there
is
no
state
tax.
in
either
case,
the
result
of
imposing
the
state
tax
would
be
that
indian
commerce
and
transactions
on
the
reservation
would
be
more
expensive
than
those
transactions
off
the
reservation.
now,
indian
tribes
are
already
suffering
from
depressed
economies.
our
tribes
are
geographically
isolated.
it
is
difficult
enough
for
them
to
rehabilitate
themselves
and
provide
essential
services
with
these
physical
and
geographical
disabilities.
now,
that
the
state
of
washington
would
impose
additional
disabilities
upon
the
state
by
effectively
preempting
its
ability
to
tax.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
think
the
district
court
answered
that
argument
very
well.
the
state
of
washington
in
the
proceedings
below
tried
to
argue
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
principle,
that
if
the
tribes
could
tax
cigarettes
they
would
extend
their
activities
to
all
sorts
of
other
situations.
the
district
court
found
--
and
this
is
essential
to
its
holding
--
that
the
tribes
had
acted
in
a
restrained
manner
and
that
the
situation
of
a
tribe
attempting
to
extend
its
laws
to
all
sorts
of
other
situations
is
simply
not
before
the
court.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
there
perhaps
is
no
absolute
theoretical
difference.
i
would
say
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
core
of
the
district
court's
holding
was
that
the
tribes
were
acting
in
a
limited
capacity,
in
a
limited
way
they
were
acting
with
restraint.
each
of
the
tribes
has
imposed
a
three-carton
limitation
in
this
case.
it
is
designed
--
each
of
our
three
client
tribes.
that
is
designed
to
prevent
an
extreme
loss
of
tax
revenues
by
the
tribe.
the
tribes
have
acted
with
restraint
and
there
is
simply
no
occasion
for
this
court
to
consider
now
a
tribe
trying
to
extend
its
activities
into
all
sorts
of
other
areas.
but
there
are
other
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
there
are
other
tribes
that
are
taxing
alcohol
sales.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
believe
that
the
mescalero
apache
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
that
was
off.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
am
not
aware
of
other
tax
systems.
i
think
some
of
the
tribes
may
have
taxed
minerals
on
the
reservations.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i'm
not
aware
of
--
well,
there
are
several
tribes
that
have
established
resorts
on
the
reservations.
i
am
not
aware
of
whether
any
taxes
are
imposed
on
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
the
same
arguments
could
be
made
but
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
because
of
the
isolation,
the
physical
isolation
of
these
tribes,
there
are
very
practical
limitations
on
the
tribes'
ability
to
raise
revenues
in
this
manner.
i
would
also
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
the
district
court
advised
us
i
think
in
its
opinion
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
tax
was
sustained
was
that
it
was
limited
and
the
tribes
were
acting
responsibly
and
the
tribes
were
not
attempting
to
take
an
unfair
or
excessive
share
of
state
tax
revenues.
the
fact
that
the
tribes
are
limited
i
think
is
essential
to
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
let
me
respond
to
that
in
this
way.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
new
york
v.
united
states
said
this.
to
press
juristic
principle
designed
for
the
practical
affairs
of
government
to
abstract
extremes
is
neither
sound
logic
nor
good
theory,
and
this
court
is
under
no
duty
to
make
law
less
than
sound
logic
and
good
sense.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
there
were
a
number
of
separate
opinions
written
by
the
court,
but
i
think
that
is
--
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
justice
frankfurter's
observation
is
a
sound
one.
the
imposition
of
state
taxes
in
this
case
ought
to
be
judged
by
what
the
tribes
are
doing,
what
limitations
are
imposed
by
the
tribes
and
not
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
one
of
the
problems
with
that
kind
of
program
is
that
in
order
for
this
tribal
enterprise
to
work,
we
have
to
be
dealing
with
an
area
in
which
the
state
taxation
is
substantial.
now,
it
is
not
practical
perhaps
for
tribes
to
enter
the
sales
tax
area
where
the
differential
wouldn't
be
great
enough
to
cause
people
to
travel
long
distances
to
the
reservation.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
it
does,
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
if
the
tribes
levied
the
same
tax
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
on
sales
of
new
cars
to
non-indians.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
the
principle
that
a
tribe
when
it
exercises
its
taxing
power
can
preempt
inconsistent
state
law
would
apply.
there
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
yes,
except
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
in
deciding
this
case
to
consider
extensions
of
this
doctrine
to
their
ultimate
and
perhaps
illogical
conclusion.
it
is
well
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
set
any
limits
that
may
be
necessary
or
appropriate.
i
would
also
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
if
this
court
said
that
it
cannot
be
applied
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
to
another
situation.
the
district
court
basically
did
that
by
cautioning
the
tribes
that
its
holding
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
tribes
were
acting
in
an
extremely
limited
manner
in
this
case,
and
i
think
the
district
court
gave
us
a
warning
in
that
instance.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
don't
believe
i
said
it
was
an
illogical
conclusion.
i
said
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
cases
which
are
not
before
it.
let
me
emphasize
one
other
point.
the
state
of
washington
is
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
the
issue
before
us
is
taxing
commodities
that
are
involved
in
commerce
between
indians
and
non-indians.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
those
are
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
say
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
am
trying
to
say
that
the
principle
before
this
court
is
a
limited
one,
and
i
think
that
it
must
be
considered
in
context,
because
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
well,
the
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
the
tribe
is
--
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
perhaps
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
steven
s.
anderson
i
said
that
the
tribe
has
extended
its
taxing
ordinance
in
a
limited
way
in
this
case
and
if
the
tribe
exercised
its
power
to
seriously
interfere
with
state
government
or
some
such
thing,
facts
which
are
not
now
before
this
court,
this
court
might
well
be
in
a
position
to
draft
a
holding
that
would
prevent
that
kind
of
abuse
if
it
was
regarded
so
of
tribal
power.
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
now.
