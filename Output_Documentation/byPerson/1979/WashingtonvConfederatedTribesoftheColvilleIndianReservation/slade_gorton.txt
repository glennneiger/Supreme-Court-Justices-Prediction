mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
washington
has
for
a
number
of
years
imposed
a
tax
of
16
cents
per
pack
on
the
sale
or
possession
of
cigarettes.
income
from
that
tax
supports
a
broad
range
of
state
programs,
services
and
institutions.
the
state's
general
sales
tax
of
5
percent
is
also
levied
against
cigarettes.
neither
tax
is
applied
to
sales
by
indians
to
other
indians
on
the
reservation
to
which
both
belong.
the
respondent
tribes
recently
have
gone
into
the
cigarette
business.
in
connection
with
that
business,
the
tribes
levy
what
they
call
a
tax
or
an
administrative
fee
on
cigarette
sales
on
their
reservations.
that
fee
is
far
smaller
than
the
state's
tax.
their
claim
in
this
litigation
is
that
their
entry
into
the
cigarette
business
together
with
their
tax
or
fee
exempts
washington
citizens
from
the
state's
cigarette
and
general
sales
taxes
for
on-reservation
purchases.
a
divided
district
court
found
that
the
state's
pre-existing
tax
was
preempted
by
the
tribal
taxes
and
fees
and
alternatively
that
the
state
tax
interfered
with
tribal
self-government.
we
appealed.
the
scheme
adopted
by
the
tribes
as
upheld
by
the
district
court
has
several
interrelated
consequences.
the
tribes
emphasize
only
one
of
these
consequences.
because
their
taxes
or
fees
are
13
to
16
cents
per
pack
lower
than
the
state
taxes,
the
tribes
sell
large
quantities
of
cigarettes
to
non-indians
who
are
willing
to
drive
considerable
distances
to
save
that
differential.
as
a
result,
the
tribes'
revenues
are
substantial.
not
mentioned
by
the
tribes,
however,
is
the
fact
that
the
state
loses
about
$4
from
its
tax
revenues
for
every
$1
which
is
secured
by
the
tribes.
incidentally,
the
total
loss
in
state
revenues
as
a
result
of
all
indian
smoke
shops
now
is
about
$13
million
per
year.
inevitably,
that
consequence
adversely
affects
the
ability
of
the
state
to
supply
governmental
and
social
services
to
its
citizens,
indian
and
non-indian
alike.
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
that
$3
difference
between
state
losses
and
tribal
receipts
remains
in
the
pockets
of
non-indian
purchasers
cannot
be
overemphasized.
it
illustrates
the
fact
that
this
case
concerns
the
asserted
right
of
an
indian
tribe
to
market
their
major
tax
exemption
to
non-indians.
those
non-indians
avoid
taxes
which
their
fellow
citizens,
who
are
either
more
principled
or
live
farther
from
reservation
smoke
shops,
must
pay.
the
state
tax
is
thus
rendered
inequitable
and
view
it
as
a
revenue
sharing
method.
the
entire
method
is
absurd.
in
this
presentation,
i
propose
first
to
deal
with
the
preemption
issue.
i
will
show
that
no
valid
source
may
be
identified
to
support
the
claim
that
the
tribes
can
preempt
or
that
the
united
states
has
preempted
these
state
taxes,
then
i
will
demonstrate
that
the
concept
of
tribal
self-government
does
not
and
cannot
by
the
imposition
of
these
same
taxes.
as
an
introduction
to
our
argument
against
preemption,
it
may
help
to
point
out
that
the
word
"preemption"
is
used
in
your
decisions
as
well
as
in
this
argument
to
describe
two
closely
related
but
distinct
concepts.
first,
the
united
states
may
preempt
the
state
tax
by
adopting
its
own
comprehensive
taxing
or
regulatory
statutes,
thus
occupying
the
field
as
it
did
in
the
situation
in
warren
trading
post.
second,
it
may
also
preempt
the
state
without
occupying
the
field
simply
by
prohibiting
the
state's
entry,
as
you
found
it
did
in
the
mcclanahan
situation.
now,
except
during
the
heyday
of
the
federal
instrumentality
doctrine,
this
court
simply
has
not
found
a
state
tax
on
non-indians
with
respect
to
their
on-reservation
activities
to
be
preempted
unless
that
preemption
is
found
in
a
statute
or
a
treaty.
and
in
mescalero
quite
recently
this
court
declined
to
revive
the
federal
instrumentality
doctrine
as
a
bar
even
to
a
state's
direct
taxation
of
a
tribal
enterprise.
eighty
years
ago,
in
thomas
v.
gay,
this
court
unequivocally
held
that
the
indian
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
standing
alone
did
not
preempt
state
or
local
taxation
of
non-indian
property
on
an
indian
reservation.
you
have
consistently
required
a
showing
of
a
preemptive
statute
or
treaty
before
striking
down
a
state
tax
on
the
on-reservation
activities
of
non-indians.
and
the
only
statute
you
have
ever
found
to
have
that
effect
was
the
indians
trader
act
and
the
circumstances
of
the
warren
trading
post
case.
that
statute
you
found
to
be
so
detailed
and
comprehensive
as
to
preempt
arizona's
levy
of
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
a
non-indian
holding
a
federal
license
to
trade
with
the
navajos
in
respect
to
his
income
from
indians
on
their
reservations.
less
all-encompassing
statutes
and
treaty
provisions,
on
the
other
hand,
simply
do
not
preempt
state
taxes
on
non-indians
doing
business
on
reservations.
almost
a
century
ago,
in
utah
and
northern
railway
company,
when
this
court
could
find
neither
a
treaty
nor
a
statutory
bar
to
a
territory's
taxation
of
an
on-reservation
railroad,
it
upheld
the
tax.
again,
in
thomas
v.
gay,
you
found
no
treaty
or
statutory
bar
to
a
local
tax
on
non-indian
cattle
grazing
on
reservation
land
leased
from
the
tribes
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
even
though
the
tribal
leases
were
granted
under
express
statutory
authority
from
congress.
and
finally,
three
years
ago,
in
moe,
you
upheld
a
state
cigarette
tax
on
non-indian
purchasers
from
an
indian
smoke
shop.
that
smoke
shop
was
located
on
land
leased
from
the
tribe,
a
tribe
also
controlled
the
shop's
purchases
of
cigarettes
and
charged
the
operator
an
administrative
fee.
nevertheless,
you
found
no
treaty
or
statutory
provision
to
preempt
the
state
tax.
to
return
for
a
third
time
to
the
decision
in
thomas
v.
gay,
the
taxpayer
asserted
there
that
the
tax
might
destroy
the
value
of
the
indian
lands
for
leasing
purposes.
this
court
found
it
sufficient
to
answer
--
and
this
is
its
complete
answer
--
"but
it
is
obvious
that
a
tax
put
upon
the
cattle
of
the
lessees
is
too
remote
and
indirect
to
be
deemed
a
tax
upon
the
land
for
privileges
of
the
indians."
this
is
precisely
the
distinction
this
court
has
reaffirmed
since
the
decline
of
the
federal
instrumentality
doctrine
in
far
broader
circumstances.
when
the
legal
incidence
of
a
tax
is
on
the
united
states
itself,
the
tax
is
invalid;
when,
however,
the
legal
incidence
of
a
state
tax
falls
on
someone
else,
even
though
its
economic
impact
is
felt
by
the
united
states,
and
even
though
it
may
be
alone
in
that
feeling,
the
tax
is
valid
unless
it
is
expressly
preempted
by
a
federal
statute
and
there
are
a
number
of
such
statutes.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
be.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
tribes
here
claim
a
more
expansive
preemption
to
apply
when
a
state
tax
on
a
private
party
impacts
the
income
of
those
tribes
than
obtains
when
such
a
tax
impacts
the
united
states
government
itself.
but
mescalero
and
moe
teach
us
that
no
such
expansive
claim
can
be
supported.
finally,
rather
than
following
respondents'
invitation
to
focus
on
federal
statutes
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
taxes,
like
the
indian
financing
act
or
the
indian
self-determination
act,
we
should
look
briefly
at
acts
which
do
explicitly
address
questions
of
state
taxing
power
over
indians
and
indian
reservations.
those
acts
include
the
buck
act,
public
law
280,
and
various
termination
acts.
the
first
two
expressly
disclaim
any
intention
to
delegate
to
the
states
any
power
to
tax
indians
on
their
reservations.
the
latter
determination
acts,
of
course,
do
authorize
just
such
taxes
after
termination.
none
of
those
acts
so
much
as
mention
any
non-indian
immunity
from
state
taxation
on
their
reservation
activities.
the
reason
for
that
is
obvious.
it
never
occurred
to
congress
that
there
was
any
such
immunity,
and
congress
was
correct.
now,
incidentally,
the
same
analysis
which
applies
to
the
determination
of
the
existence
of
non-indian
tax
immunity
on
reservations,
is
there
a
statute
or
a
treaty
creating
them,
seems
also
to
be
the
key
at
least
to
your
modern
determinations
of
the
validity
of
state
attempts
to
tax
on
reservation
indians
themselves.
while
such
cases
are
decided
against
the
backdrop
of
the
indian's
sovereignty
doctrine,
a
statutory
or
treaty
provision
always
seems
to
provide
the
basis
for
preempting
a
state
tax
levied
on
reservation
indians.
in
mcclanahan
it
was
the
navajo
treaty
and
a
statutory
pattern.
in
connection
with
the
compensating
use
tax
invalidated
in
mescalero,
it
was
a
single
section
of
the
indian
reorganization
act.
in
moe,
state
taxes
on
reservation
indians
were
preempted
only
by
the
statutes
cited
in
mcclanahan
and
mescalero
and
not
by
any
doctrine
of
constitutional
law.
inevitably,
therefore,
the
question
here
must
be
what
if
any
treaty
or
statutory
source
can
be
found
to
prevent
the
state
from
taxing
non-indians
engaged
in
purchases
of
cigarettes
which
purchases
were
identical
to
those
in
moe.
the
statutory
pattern
here
is
unchanged
from
the
statutory
pattern
in
that
case
and
the
applicable
treaty
provisions
here,
among
those
who
are
treaty
tribes,
are
identical
in
effect
to
those
of
the
helgate
treaty
present
in
the
moe
case.
although
the
tribal
participation
in
the
cigarette
basis
in
the
yakima
case
here
as
to
the
tribal
lease
arrangements,
purchasing
control
and
administrative
fees
present
in
moe,
only
the
tribes'
wholesaling
functions
in
that
cigarette
business,
the
tribes
claim
that
a
congressional
policy
of
encouraging
indian
self-government
preempts
the
state
taxes
in
these
cases.
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
subsequent
federal
enactments
cited
by
respondents
in
their
preemption
argument
seem
to
be
designed
to
accomplish
twin
goals.
first,
to
improve
the
economic
status
of
individual
indians;
and,
second,
to
foster
tribal
self-government.
as
this
court
characterized
the
indian
reorganization
act
in
the
mescalero
opinion,
"these
provisions
were
designed
to
encourage
tribal
enterprises
to
enter
the
white
world
on
a
footing
of
equal
competition."
now,
moe
tells
us
that
no
federal
statute
or
treaty
gives
an
individual
indian
a
huge
competitive
advantage
in
the
cigarette
business
by
preempting
a
state
tax
levied
on
non-indians.
thomas
v.
gay,
mescalero,
and
moe
teaches
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
non-indian
tax
may
adversely
impact
tribal
income
does
not
trigger
en
automatic
preemption
of
that
state
tax.
how
then
can
a
tribal
entry
into
the
cigarette
business,
with
or
without
a
tribal
tax,
trigger
a
preemption
which
gives
the
tribe
a
prohibitive
competitive
advantage
in
the
teeth
of
the
federal
goal
to
encourage
tribal
enterprises
to
enter
the
non-indian
business
world
on
a
footing
of
equal
competition?
mr.
slade
gorton
the
same
argument
is
applicable
to
both.
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
the
policy
of
these
acts
are
that
indians
should
enter
the
non-indian
business
world
on
an
equal
footing
basis.
mr.
slade
gorton
to
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
kind
of
tax
was
even
upheld
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
answer
is
that
the
tribe
cannot
trigger
such
a
preemption
since
no
federal
statute
has
been
cited
for
the
preposition
that
tribal
enterprises
are
entitled
to
unequal
advantages
over
their
non-indian
competitors.
the
state's
non-discriminatory
taxes
on
non-indian
purchasers
of
cigarettes
from
indian
dealers
are
not
preempted.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
basis
for
that
would
be
mcclanahan.
i
believe
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
be
preemption.
mr.
slade
gorton
preemption
from
the
statutory
and
treaty
pattern
which
was
utilized
in
mcclanahan
and
then
later
in
moe
to
preempt
exactly
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
the
correct
statement
would
be,
based
on
moe
and
expressly
on
footnote
17
of
moe,
that
absent
a
federal
statute
or
treaty
provision
preventing
or
prohibiting
such
a
tax,
the
state
would
be
permitted
to
impose
it
even
on
sales
to
indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
precisely
the
pattern
which
was
utilized
in
mcclanahan
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
in
mcclanahan,
it
would
be
a
prohibition
because
there
was
no
occupation
of
the
field,
nor
was
there
in
moe.
there
were
no
indian
taxes
which
interfered
in
the
state's
attempt
to
impose
a
tax
in
either
mcclanahan
or
moe
on
indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
that's
correct.
the
tribes
and
the
united
states
assert
that
even
if
there
is
no
preemption
of
the
state's
power
to
tax
on-reservation
cigarette
purchases
by
non-indians,
nevertheless
the
state
tax
may
not
be
imposed
because
it
infringes
upon
the
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
lives
and
be
governed
by
them,
and
it
states
that
as
a
separate
theory.
that
right
of
indian
self-government
standing
alone
without
preemption
can
never
bar
the
imposition
of
a
tax
by
the
state
on
its
own
non-indian
citizens.
in
illustration,
the
broadest
powers
of
self-government
which
can
be
possessed
any
sovereign
are
those
exercised
by
a
fully
sovereign
nation,
obviously.
but
the
united
states
itself,
obviously
a
self-governing
sovereign,
has
no
power
to
prevent
great
britain
from
imposing
taxes
on
british
citizens,
on
purchases
made
by
those
citizens
on
visits
here
to
the
united
states,
even
if
the
goods
purchased
here
never
leave
the
united
states.
another
illustration
is
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
could
not
because
the
united
states
retailer
is
not
within
great
britain.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
could
impose
a
different
tax.
we
can
impose
a
tax
when
they
return
with
those
goods
to
the
state
of
washington.
we
could
not
impose
a
tax
if
they
never
did
so.
but
the
point
is
here
that
--
mr.
slade
gorton
my
british
analogy
would
not
cover
this
situation
because
the
united
states
constitution
would
prevent
the
state
of
washington
from
making
that
imposition.
that
is
why
i
used
the
british
example.
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
bar
the
british
tax
collector
in
dealing
with
its
own
citizens.
the
point
here
is,
however,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
this
injunction
and
the
theory
of
the
case
by
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
doesn't
say
that
we
simply
can't
collect
this
tax
on
the
reservation
but
can
collect
it
from
non-indians
who
leave
the
reservation.
it
says
that
the
tax
is
invalid,
we
cannot
impose
it
at
all,
even
after
non-indian
citizens
return.
and
of
course,
that
is
necessary
to
their
argument
because
in
order
to
protect
their
tribal
income,
they
need
to
prevent
us
from
imposing
that
tax
anyway,
not
simply
from
collecting
it
on
the
reservation
itself.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
automobile
dealership
were
a
tribal
enterprise
producing
income
for
the
tribe
the
theory
of
the
district
court
would
prevent
that
tax,
and
i
intend
to
get
to
that
in
a
little
bit
greater
detail
in
just
a
moment.
another
illustration
similar
to
the
british
one,
the
yakima
nation
was
fully
sovereign
early
in
the
19th
century;
nevertheless,
it
could
not
then
have
exercised
that
unlimited
power
of
self-government
to
prohibit
the
united
states
from
taxing
one
of
its
citizen
members
of
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
on
purchases
which
that
citizen
made
from
the
yakima
indians
in
the
yakima
nation.
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
might
have
prohibited
such
a
tax,
but
the
laws
of
the
yakima
nation
could
not
have
done
so.
the
power
to
levy
a
tax
may
be
inherent
in
retained
sovereignty,
but
the
power
to
bar
the
imposition
of
a
tax
by
another
sovereignty
on
its
own
citizens
in
its
own
territory
is
not.
thus
the
limited
right
of
self-government
now
possessed
by
the
indian
tribes
cannot
bar
washington's
imposition
of
these
cigarette
taxes
upon
non-
indians
in
washington
state.
the
united
states
may
in
the
future
preempt
these
taxes
by
some
statute
or
even
authorize
the
tribe
to
do
so,
but
to
assert
the
right
of
tribal
self-government
is
not
to
prevent
an
alternative
grounds
for
affirming
the
district
court,
it
is
merely
to
restate
the
preemption
argument.
nothing
in
this
submission,
of
course,
is
designed
to
deny
the
realities
of
the
tribal
self-government
doctrine
and
the
proposition
of
state
actions
may
not
infringe
on
the
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
lives
or
to
be
ruled
by
them.
that
williams
v.
lee
doctrine
does
two
things.
affirmatively,
it
confirms
in
the
tribes
the
right
to
control
internal
tribal
relations,
to
prescribe
laws
applicable
to
tribal
members,
and
to
enforce
those
laws
in
its
own
court.
negatively,
it
prohibits
the
state
from
applying
its
laws
to
on-reservation
indians
and
enforcing
those
laws
in
state
courts
except
where
authorized
by
congress
to
do
so.
this
protection
necessarily
requires
non-indians
to
sue
reservation
indians
in
tribal
court
in
order
to
enforce
rights
created
on
the
reservation.
a
state
tax
upon
non-indians
cannot
possibly
affect
that
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
laws
and
to
be
governed
by
them.
this
court
has
never
extended
that
doctrine
to
bar
a
state
tax
on
non-indians,
nor
should
it
do
so
now.
to
do
so
would
be
to
subvert
the
very
foundations
of
state
sovereignty
and
the
ability
of
the
state
to
adopt
a
just
and
equitable
tax
system.
if
the
state
of
washington
may
not
impose
a
cigarette
tax
on
reservation
sales
to
non-indians
because
to
do
so
would
interfere
with
tribal
self-government
by
destroying
a
source
of
tribal
revenue,
can
the
state
the
even
repeal
its
tax
on
off-reservation
sales
in
order
to
equalize
tax
burdens
on
its
citizens?
that
action
would
have
exactly
the
same
effect
on
tribal
cigarette
sales
and
tribal
income
as
would
the
imposition
of
the
state's
tax
on
reservations.
of
course,
the
state
retains
the
right,
the
power
to
repeal
its
off-reservation
tax.
the
question
and
answer
simply
illustrates
the
point
that
the
effect
on
tribal
revenues
of
a
state
tax
on
non-indians
is
as
irrelevant
to
the
right
of
tribal
self-government
today
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
thomas
v.
gay.
the
state
of
washington
has
chosen
rationally
to
levy
high
excise
taxes
on
tobacco
and
liquor,
among
other
things,
either
to
discourage
their
consumption
or
to
concentrate
its
revenue
sources
on
socially
marginal
activities
rather
than
on
important
activities
such
as
the
purchase
of
food.
that
choice
and
similar
future
choices
are
threatened
by
the
decision
below.
our
state
might
well
choose
in
the
future
to
impose
extremely
high
excise
taxes
on,
say
the
purchase
of
gold
or
of
motor
vehicles
which
make
less
than
20
miles
per
gallon
of
gas.
should
the
district
court
be
affirmed,
however,
the
sale
of
those
goods
if
the
tax
were
high
enough
could
immediately
be
monopolized
by
indian
tribes
by
the
simple
expedient
of
adopting
tribal
ordinances
similar
to
those
at
issue
here.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
not
make
any
theoretical
difference
in
the
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
remembering,
of
course,
that
the
indians
could
sell
it
tax-free
to
their
own
members,
but
that
tax
might
very
well
be
found
to
be
unconstitutional
or
in
some
kind
of
violation
of
due
process,
but
that
is
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
set
of
statutory
patterns
and
the
tribal
arguments
were
identical
to
those
here,
the
result
would
be
the
same.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
case
of
furniture
shops,
the
district
court
here
found
that
the
tax
would
apply
because
the
indians
had
not
shown
that
it
had
any
effect
on
their
income.
in
effect,
the
power
to
decide
how
washington
citizens
will
be
taxed
and
what
social
goals
are
to
be
pursued
will
be
transferred
from
the
state
legislature
to
the
tribal
councils.
we
submit
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
any
act
of
congress
nor
any
treaty
provision
nor
the
right
of
tribal
self-government
permits
such
a
subversion
of
rational
state
policies
of
non-discriminatory
taxes
on
non--indians.
the
right
of
indian
self-government
and
the
right
of
all
citizens
for
self-government
can
flourish
together
only
if
these
decisions
are
reversed.
there
is,
however,
a
shorter
and
similar
and
simpler
answer
to
this
controversy
if
this
court
wishes
to
adopt
it,
is
simply
follow
your
own
decision
in
moe.
the
transactions
here
do
not
differ
significantly
from
those
in
moe.
in
the
yakima
case
here,
the
tribe
does
not
claim
to
be
engaged
in
the
retail
cigarette
business,
nor
does
it
claim
to
tax
cigarette
sales
to
non-indians.
it
is
solely
a
cigarette
wholesaler
whose
profit
is
partly
called
by
that
name
and
partly
denominated
an
administrative
fee.
the
tribe
in
moe
imposed
just
such
an
administrative
fee,
leased
the
smoke
shop
site
and
controlled
wholesale
purchases.
in
the
colville
case
here,
the
tribes
claim
to
be
in
the
retail
cigarette
business
and
to
levy
a
retail
tax
on
cigarettes.
but
the
actual
conduct
of
that
business
does
not
differ
from
that
of
the
yakimas.
the
tribe
is
really
a
wholesaler
profiting
from
two
different
markups,
one
of
which
it
calls
a
tax.
the
smoke
shop
operator
is
much
like
the
operator
in
moe.
he
pays
a
fixed
price
per
carton
to
the
tribe,
sets
whatever
retail
price
he
wishes
and
takes
home
his
gross
sales
receipts
less
his
costs
and
business
expenses.
the
state
taxes
on
non-indian
purchasers
and
its
collection
requirements
on
indian
retailers
operate
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
and
with
precisely
the
same
results
as
did
the
montana
tax
in
moe.
the
result
here
should
be
the
same
as
well.thank
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
anderson's
presentation
seemed
primarily
devoted
to
the
responsibility
of
the
indians
and
the
limitation
of
what
was
described
as
a
modest
business,
emphasizing
the
fact
that
at
the
present
time
his
tribal
clients
limit
sales
to
three
cartons
of
cigarettes
a
piece
and
that
it
was
only
on
that
basis
that
the
district
court
permitted
the
tax.
that
is
demonstrably
not
the
case,
as
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
yakima
ordinances
which
were
upheld
at
exactly
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
set
of
cases
by
the
district
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
showing
in
the
record
of
the
extremely
long
distances
which
people
drive
to
purchase
on
the
yakima
reservation
not
only
for
their
own
use
but
for
the
use
of
their
friends
and
neighbors.
he
also
seemed
to
say,
i
believe,
mr.
rehnquist,
that
somehow
or
another
that,
while
footnote
17
in
the
moe
case
stated
that
tax
exemptions
to
indians
on
reservation
had
only
a
statutory
basis,
that
tax
exemptions
to
non-indians
had
a
constitutional
basis,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
relatively
inconsistent.
finally,
each
of
my
opponents
here
has
attempted
at
one
stage
or
another
to
avoid
the
logical
extension
of
their
argument
in
dealing
with
how
many
economic
enterprises
the
tribe
could
engage
in,
displacing
--
to
take
state
tax
authority
over
its
own
residents
for
example,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
when
you
asked
mr.
claiborne
the
hypothetical
of
the
manufacturing
enterprise
controlled
by
the
tribe
on
reservation,
he
said
that
the
state
could
impose
its
use
tax
after
its
citizens
had
purchased
those
automobiles
and
removed
them
from
the
reservation
because
you
didn't
include
a
tribal
tax
in
your
hypothetical.
clearly,
his
answer
would
have
been
that
were
there
even
the
most
modest
tribal
taxes,
that
that
enterprise
too
would
be
tax
free.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
made
that
quite
express
when
later
on
in
his
presentation
he
stated
that
in
all
probability
that
the
state
taxes
would
be
invalid
without
a
tax
by
the
indian
tribes
simply
because
of
the
tribal
participation
in
the
sale.
while
each
of
these
gentlemen
has
stated
that
they
do
not
seek
here
to
reargue
or
to
reverse
law,
in
effect
every
one
of
them,
every
one
of
their
arguments
for
all
practical
purposes
requires
reading
moe
out
of
the
united
states
reports.
the
pure
fact
that
the
matter
is
that
i
do
agree
with
mr.
claiborne
on
one
statement
only,
and
that
is,
of
course,
that
the
state
could
have
the
same
effect
on
tribal
businesses
simply
by
repealing
its
tax.
what
that
shows
more
clearly
than
anything
else
is
the
fact
that
the
state
tax
system
is
not
an
interference
with
tribal
self-government,
because
the
effect
of
a
state
action
is
identical
in
either
event.
if
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
one
decision,
it
clearly
has
the
right
to
make
another.
nothing
in
the
state's
program
here
prohibits
any
type
of
regulation
of
business
on
reservations
by
the
indian
tribes,
nothing
in
our
submission
here
prohibits
them
from
adding
markups
or
taxes
to
their
tribal
enterprises.
we
simply
say
that
they
are
subject
to
the
same
economic
constraints
that
a
state
is
in
a
taxing
policy.
a
state
can
certainly
impose
a
tax
which
will
be
self-defeating
because
it
will
be
so
high
that
people
will
not
purchase
either
the
commodity
or
the
commodity
in
a
particular
place.
state
legislatures
must
deal
with
that
question
every
day
of
the
week,
and
we
simply
say
that
tribal
councils
must
do
so,
too,
and
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
in
effect
to
be
parasites
on
the
state
system,
gaining
from
the
state
system
only
because
of
rational
state
decisions
in
connection
with
its
own
tax
authority.
they
do
have
a
retained
right
in
self-government,
that
right
does
not
however
include
the
right
to
distort
a
state
tax
system
and
to
make
it
either
ineffective
or
unjust.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
essentially
the
same.
the
question
in
the
motor
vehicle
excise
tax
is
simply
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
montana
tax
which
you
voided
in
moe
was
clearly
a
property
tax
imposed
on
the
reservation.
the
state
tax
in
this
case
is
a
pure
use
tax
which
applies
when
the
automobile
is
used
off
of
the
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington.
our
tax
could
not
be
applied
to
on-reservation
uses
of
an
automobile
exclusively
if
they
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
no,
no.
this
is
an
annual
tax.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
expressly
--
and
in
our
state
it
always
has
been,
this
wasn't
a
recent
amendment,
it
is
expressly
a
tax
on
the
right
to
use
an
automobile
on
the
roads
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
it
is.
