mr.
james
b.
hovis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
yakima
indian
nation,
appellee,
in
the
united
states
v.
washington
case.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
this
principle
that
we
are
asking
for
here
should
be
limited
just
to
cigarettes.
i
see
no
logical
difference
between
any
goods,
whether
it
is
cigarettes,
cars,
furniture,
et
cetera.
it
would
appear
to
me
in
the
principle
position
that
we
take
that
if
the
state
requires
relief
with
regards
to
sales
of
other
items
that
do
not
fit
in
with
the
indian
economy
and
do
exceed
their
sovereign
bounds,
that
the
remedy
that
the
state
of
washington
would
have
would
be
a
legislative
one
before
congress.
my
colleague,
mr.
anderson,
has
really
put
the
focus
of
his
discussion
with
regards
to
this
matter
on
the
williams
preemption
infringement
test.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
--
and
it
is
stipulated
in
brief
by
everyone
in
this
case
--
that
if
the
state
tax
goes
on
that
it
will
destroy
the
federally
approved
tribal
and
tribal
licensed
enterprises.
i
think
it
must
be
pointed
out
that
in
each
tribe,
that
the
federal
government,
through
the
responsible
federal
authority
has
had
these
enterprises
approved
by
the
federal
government.
and
i
would
join
my
colleagues
in
submitting
that
the
washington
scheme
is
in
violation
of
the
williams
infringement
preemption
test
and
that
the
district
court's
holdings
are
correct.
but
i
would,
if
the
court
please,
like
to
take
my
portion
of
the
time
to
talk
about
washington
jurisdiction
and
power
to
reach
these
transactions
on
indian
reservations,
on
trust
lands
where
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
or
power,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
would
impair
the
tribal
government
or
impair
the
tribal
enterprise
or
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
would
destroy
it.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
regardless
of
whether
there
is
an
indian
tax.
i
think
general
gorton
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
no,
no.
no,
sir
no,
sir.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
montana.
general
gorton,
as
i
see
it,
in
his
attempt,
in
the
state
of
washington's
attempt
to
destroy
private
self-government
has
two
perimeters
it
must
pierce.
the
first
one
is
what
i
call
the
mcclanahan
principle,
this
court
has
called
the
mcclanahan
principle,
and
the
second
one
is
the
williams
infringement
test,
is
a
second
perimeter
he
must
pierce
before
he
can
destroy
tribal
self-government.
i
submit
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
jurisdiction
or
power
to
tax
the
sale
between
the
indians
and
non-indians
on
trust
lands
within
the
yakima
indian
reservation.
i
think
this
court
has
pointed
this
way
to
me
in
its
1973
pro
curium
decision
in
tonasket
v.
washington,
when
the
washington
tax
system
was
last
before
this
court,
and
at
that
time
they
said
--
they
reversed
the
washington
tax
scheme,
saying
we
reverse
and
send
it
back,
the
supreme
court
decision,
and
we
ask
you
to
look
first
at
the
state
law
and
second
at
the
mcclanahan
case.
and
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
then
dealt
with
it,
they
said
that
under
state
law
the
tax
did
not
apply
and
therefore
reversed
their
original
decision,
but
not
based
on
the
mcclanahan
principle
because
they
took
care
of
it
and
the
state
law
did
not
arise.
in
mcclanahan,
this
court
determined
that
arizona
had
exceeded
its
power
when
it
attempted
to
apply
arizona's
individual
income
tax
to
a
reservation
indian,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
action
infringed
on
the
tribal
government.
this
court
has
said
in
bryan
v.
itasca
county
that
the
mcclanahan
principle
provides
that
state
laws
are
not
applicable
to
tribal
indians
on
indian
reservations
reservations
except
where
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
state
laws
shall
apply.
my
learned
friend,
general
gorton,
relies
on
this
court's
holding
in
moe
v.
salish
and
kootenai
tribes
and
submits
that
the
mcclanahan
principle
is
not
applicable
to
this
instant
case.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
reason
that
i
believe
and
submit
the
reason
that
i
believe
that
moe
is
not
applicable
here.
in
moe,
what
this
court
did,
as
i
read
the
decision,
was
to
uphold
the
district
court's
denial
of
a
restraint
of
criminal
arrest
of
indian
retailers
selling
unstamped
cigarettes
to
non-indians
contrary
to
the
state
criminal
code
on
the
site
of
the
reservation
where
congress
had
expressly
authorized
state
criminal
jurisdiction.
moe
did
not
involve
the
collection
of
taxes
from
indian
retailers,
it
did
not
involve
a
state
licensing
or
the
state
regulation
of
indian
retailers;
while
here
this
case
involves
the
collection
of
the
taxes
if
the
indians
do
not
collect
them
from
the
non-indian
purchasers
or
collect
the
taxes
from
the
indian
purchasers,
and
also
provide
for
the
state
regulation
of
the
retailers
to
provide
with
the
state
regulations
in
regards
to
this.
my
friend,
general
gorton,
suggests
that
it
has
the
power
to
collect
these
taxes
and
we
believe
that
is
not
correct
because
where
these
transactions
took
place
on
the
yakima
reservation
were
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
yakima
reservation
and
on
trust
land
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
the
state
has
no
criminal
or
civil
jurisdiction
over
the
indians
involved
on
these
lands.
this
court
in
washington
v.
yakima
nation
last
term
upheld
that
this
was
part
of
the
state's
purpose,
to
provide
for
state
government
to
keep
the
jurisdiction
off
of
that
and
held
that
congress
had
to
have
in
mind,
especially
had
that
in
mind
when
it
passed
public
law
286,
that
such
a
partial
quoting
of
jurisdiction
could
be
provided.
now,
the
transactions
which
washington
claimed
taxing
power
all
took
place
on
these
lands
and
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
tribal
members
at
all
for
an
regulatory
power,
arrest
power,
civil
or
criminal,
judicial
or
legislative
power
over
the
indians
involved.
and
as
this
court
said
in
mcclanahan,
unless
the
states
can
show
how
they
can
constitutionally
impose
the
collection
of
this
tax
and
the
regulation
on
the
indians
where
they
have
no
jurisdiction,
legislative
or
judicial,
then
that
disposes
of
the
case.
and
that
is
pages
178
and
179
of
that
decision.
now,
washington
--
my
friend,
general
gorton,
submits
that
washington,
in
his
brief,
may
seize
without
process,
due
or
otherwise,
goods
being
delivered
to
my
clients
in
interstate
commerce
on
trust
lands.
now,
these
goods
that
are
being
delivered
to
my
clients,
the
yakima
nation,
are
not
taxable
in
any
event
because
it
is
clear
that
these
goods
are
sold
to
indians
on
the
indian
reservation,
on
trust
lands.
the
yakima
nation
does
not
sell
to
non-indians.
non-indian
retailers
later
sell
--
i
mean
the
indian
retailers
of
course
later
sell
to
non-indians,
but
when
these
goods
are
in
transit
they
are
not
being
sent
to
the
yakima
indian
reservation
in
interstate
commerce
by
bonded
carriers,
the
sale
to
the
yakima
nation
is
a
legal
one
to
its
licensed
retailers.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it
struck
down
the
tax
situation
on
the
preemption
and
the
infringement
test,
on
the
williams
test,
and
they
didn't
reach
that.
but
i
am
suggesting
this
for
a
full
discussion
of
this
problem
before
the
court
because
this
court
has
not
this
case
but
it
has
similar
cases
that
it
has
accepted
jurisdiction
on
that
some
discussion
of
the
mcclanahan
principle
would
be
applicable
here
today
in
your
determination.
and
i
am
into
the
enforcement
area
here
to
show
you
that
there
is
no
due
process
--
i
submit
to
you
that
there
is
no
due
process
way
that
the
state
of
washington
can
collect
the
tax
or
have
any
power,
legislative
or
judicial,
over
the
indian
retailers
which
they
suggest
they
are
trying
to
do.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
we
are
not
in
any
different
--
nor
do
i
claim
that
we
are
any
different
from
the
state
of
oregon.
if
you
purchase
something
in
oregon
and
providing
that
you
comply
with
the
constitutional
commerce
clause,
if
the
state
of
washington
does
that
and
is
not
discriminatory,
then
they
can
collect
from
their
non-indians
when
they
are
within
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
well,
i
have
not
asked
the
united
states.
but
they
do
not
take
the
same
position
in
this
case
that
i
do,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
they
may
not.
they
have
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever,
legislative
or
judicial,
over
the
indian
seller.
that
is
my
point.
i
can
go
further,
however.
there
may
--
i
do
not
disagree
totally
with
my
colleague,
mr.
anderson.
i
do
not
disagree
totally
but
i
don't
think
this
is
clear
in
this
principle.
i
think
there
is
a
situation
here
where
this
sale
may
not
be
able
to
reach
with
a
use
tax
outside
the
exterior
boundary,
and
let
me
explain
to
you
why
i
do
not
disagree
with
mr.
anderson,
although
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
as
clear
as
this
principle.
the
reason
i
do
not
disagree
with
him
is
because
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
congress
has
been
silent.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
congress
has
been
silent.
congress
has
in
passing
the
buck
act
said
that
it
permits
the
state
to
levy
sales,
use
or
income
taxes
in
federal
areas
but
it
expressly
provides
that
nothing
therein
shall
be
deemed
to
authorize
the
collection
or
any
tax
on
or
from
any
indian
not
taxed
and,
as
pointed
out
in
our
cases
in
the
brief,
this
is
a
continuance
of
an
existing
thing.
now,
i
was
particularly
interested
in
a
decision
written
by
justice
donaldson
for
the
mahoney
majority
in
the
idaho
supreme
court,
and
i
adopt
his
understanding
and
i
adopt
his
rationale.
as
he
pointed
out,
the
congress
must
have
been
aware
at
the
time
it
passed
the
buck
act
in
section
109
of
the
existing
solicitor's
opinion
of
the
united
states
that
opinioned
that
indians
are
not
subject
to
state
laws
whether
they
deal
with
indians
or
non-indians,
in
the
tax
field.
now,
that
mahoney
decision
is
a
weight
one.
you
see,
that
is
the
circumstance
we
have
surrounding
us,
idaho
underneath
their
state
law
does
not
tax
--
does
not
try
to
impress
the
situation.
i
think
it
is
worth
nothing
that
with
the
regularity
that
this
court
sees
mr.
gorton,
that
the
state
of
washington
has
somewhat
different
attitude
about
indian
rights
in
some
of
our
neighboring
states.
but
one
of
the
things,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
your
question
you
were
talking
a
little
bit
about
some
of
the
discussion
of
mcclanahan.
yes,
there
has
been
some
change
in
the
worcester
doctrine,
some
modification
in
the
line
of
more
preemption.
but
one
of
the
problems
--
because,
you
see,
in
worcester,
it
was
a
non-indian.
worcester
was
a
non-indian,
underneath
the
worcester
doctrine.
