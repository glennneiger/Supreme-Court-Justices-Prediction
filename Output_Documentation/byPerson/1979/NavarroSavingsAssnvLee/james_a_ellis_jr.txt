mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
must
disagree
with
my
learned
colleague
as
to
the
essence
of
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit.
it
is
my
reading
of
the
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
who
alleged
that
they
were
trustees
of
a
business
trust
were
the
real
parties
and
interest
and
that
it
was
their
citizenship
that
governed
the
question
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction.
it
was
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that
is
i
believe
that
essence
of
the
test.
that's
correct
your
honor.
like
mr.
morrissey,
in
the
morrissey
case
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
trustees
of
an
expressed
trust.
the
long
ran
of
decisions
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs
by
both
sides,
hold
two
basic
premisses
that
i
think
are
essential
to
the
analysis
of
this
case.
those
cited
by
mr.
fischman
on
behalf
of
his
clients
including
chapman
versus
barney,
and
marshall
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
and
the
bouligny
case,
all
stand
for
this
proposition
that
in
unincorporated
group
of
individuals
that
by
state
law
or
otherwise
have
the
right
to
sue
in
a
joint
name
are
--
that
joint
name
is
nevertheless
not
a
citizen.
citizenship
is
a
status
that
is
attributed
only
to
flesh
and
blood
individuals
and
when
there's
a
suit
in
a
joint
name,
it
becomes
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
determine
who
really
are
the
flesh
and
blood
individuals
that
are
suing
in
that
name.
the
cases
which
we
cited
i
think
hold
to
the
proposition
that
when
a
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
of
a
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
a
beneficiary,
really
and
truly,
then
it
is
the
citizenship
of
the
plaintiff,
the
trustee
and
not
the
citizenship
of
the
beneficiary
that
governs
the
question
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
only
when
it
is
a
non
personal
suit,
that
is
a
suit
by
an
entity
or
in
the
joint
name
of
several
individuals
do
we
have
to
question
that
counsel
poses
and
that
is
trying
to
determine
the
citizenship
of
that
name
or
that
entity.
to
analyze
this
case,
we
think
it's
important
that
the
court
consider
the
basic
purpose
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction,
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
early
in
this
court's
history,
commented
that
the
draft
of
--
of
the
constitution
either
had
apprehension
as
to
the
impartiality
of
the
state
courts
or
at
least
viewed
with
indulgence,
the
possible
fears
and
apprehensions
in
that
regard,
that
suitors
might
have.
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
is
to
provide
a
device
to
give
some
protection
against
local
prejudice.
another
kind
of
prejudice
that
is
--
prejudice
is
a
subject
that
this
court
deals
within
many
ways
--
of
course,
this
is
not
prejudice
based
on
race,
religion,
or
sex,
but
it
is
prejudice
against
united
states
citizens
based
upon
their
domicile,
their
citizenship
in
a
state
other
than
the
state
of
the
opposing
party,
the
state
before.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
there
is
that
apprehension
among
some
litigants
in
texas
and
i
suspect
in
most
of
the
other
states
also.
i
must
say
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
case
was
brought
in
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
state
court.
whether
it's
true
or
not,
no
one
will
know,
but
the
apprehension
of
local
prejudice
is
one
of
the
motivating
factors
for
bringing
the
suit
in
--
in
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that.
in
the
federal
court
in
dallas,
the
juries
are
selected
from
the
dallas
division
of
the
northern
district
of
texas,
encompassing
both
rural
and
urban
localities.
in
the
state
court
in
--
of
course,
at
kinney
county
where
this
--
where
then
you
would
have
been
placed
in
the
state
court
system
here,
the
juries
would
have
been
selected
only
out
of
that
rural
county
and
that
we
feel
that
it
is
a
significant
difference
to
be
able
to
choose
both
the
broader
spectrum
of
the
jurors
and
the
article
iii
judge
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
certainly,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
are
a
number
of
article
iii
judges
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
yes.
and
i
must
say
though
that
those
judges
who
have
become
article
iii
judges
in
texas,
no
longer
have
to
stand
for
election
in
partisan
elections,
as
other
judges
do
and
we
feel
have
a
greater
capacity
for
impartiality.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
--
i'd
like
to
move
the
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
--
that's
correct.
and
the
--
and
the
question
is
a
simple
question
and
we
think
that
the
answer
is
an
easy
question
--
easy
answer.
is
this
a
controversy
between
citizens
of
different
states?
the
question
is
who
is
the
controversy
between?
we
must
examine
the
controversy
that
is
the
controversial
facts,
out
of
which
the
case
arose,
the
case
itself
as
pleaded
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
parties
to
both
the
controversy
and
the
lawsuit.
the
answer
we
think
should
be
not
mere
theory,
but
a
real
and
practical
answer.
now,
who
is
the
controversy
between?
is
it
between
the
plaintiffs
on
the
one
hand,
all
of
whom
are
individuals
who
are
citizens
of
a
state
other
than
texas
and
on
the
other,
a
texas
corporation
that
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
texas?
what
is
the
controversy?
the
controversy
is
a
suit
between
the
plaintiffs
who
alleged
that
in
our
capacity
as
trustees,
they
entered
a
business
transaction
that
involved
the
defendant,
navarro
savings
association.
they
contend
that
they
lent
$850,000
and
accepted
a
note
payable
to
them
as
trustees
and
that
as
part
of
that
transaction,
they
received
a
take-out
commitment,
a
commitment
to
make
loan
from
navarro
and
that
there
was
breach
of
that
commitment.
they
claimed
damages
and
seek
relief.
of
course,
there
was
no
trial
in
this
case,
it
will
be
incumbent
upon
the
plaintiff,
upon
remand
to
prove
that
they're
entitled
to
the
relief
they
seek
including
that
they
are
entitled
to
receive
that
relief
in
their
capacity
as
trustees.
there
was
no
challenge
in
the
trial
court
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
individual
trustees
here,
lacked
capacity
sue.
that
they
were
--
there
was
no
challenge
that
they
were
not
the
real
parties
in
the
interest,
there
was
no
challenge
that
any
of
the
9500
beneficial
shareholders
were
necessary
or
indispensable
party
to
the
lawsuit.
there
was
no
challenge
that
there
was
any
improper
joinder
of
plaintiffs,
or
collision,
or
any
other
improper
device
to
create
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
is
alleged
that
three
of
the
eight
are
shareholders.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
apparently
by
following
this
argument.
premise
number
one,
this
is
a
suit
by
the
trust
rather
by
the
individual
plaintiff
trustees.
we
disagree
strongly
with
that,
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
held
very
specifically,
that
the
trust
was
not
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
it
was
the
individual
trustees,
who
were
the
plaintiff.
but
premise
number
one
is
that
this
is
a
suit
by
the
trust.
premise
number
two
is
that
the
trust
is
not
a
citizen.
we
agree
with
that.
the
trust
is
not
a
citizen.
premise
number
three,
is
that
we
must
determine
what
the
citizenship
of
that
trust
is
and
we
conclude
that
it
is
that
of
all
the
shareholders.
and
therefore,
it
is
really
a
suit
by
9500
people
who
were
--
who
were
not
involved
in
the
transaction,
who
are
named
plaintiffs,
who
have
no
involvement
in
the
litigation.
that
is
the
argument
we
contend
that
the
trial
court's
dismissal
of
this
case
was
based
upon
and
we
think
that
it
is
not
correct
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
reversal.
the
proper
analysis
we
think
is
this,
assuming
that
we
are
in
error
as
to
the
premise
number
one
and
that
this
really
and
truly
was
a
suit
by
the
trust,
rather
than
by
the
trustees
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
sense
in
which
i'm
using
the
word.
of
course,
a
trust
is
hard
to
define
metaphysically.
it
is
a
relationship
between
some
beneficiaries
on
one
hand
and
some
trustees
on
the
other.
in
this
situation
of
course,
there
is
a
right
to
sue
in
the
name
of
the
trust.
and
the
question
is,
who
is
it
really
that's
suing
in
the
name
of
the
trust?
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
again,
i
believe
that
it
is
a
--
a
series
of
rights
and
responsibilities
between
some
beneficiaries,
some
people
here,
and
some
trustees,
some
people
over
here,
and
that
it
is
not
a
thing
or
a
person.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
is
a
thing
in
a
sense
that
of
course,
it
has
no
citizenship.
it
is
not
a
flesh
and
blood
person,
of
course.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
is
an
entity.
is
--
that's
one
way
to
view
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
--
if
calls
itself
generally
fidelity
mortgage
investors,
using
the
name
of
the
trust
as
--
as
the
thing
that
is
communicating
with
the
trust
--
with
the
beneficiaries.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
is
a
name.
it
is
simply
a
name.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
in
many
ways,
i
believe
it
is
the
exact
the
same
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
those
in
our
brief
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
--
decisions
by
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
that
is
the
rule
that
we
relied
on
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
is
the
trustees
who
hold
legal
title.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
are
the
only
people
who
have
right
to
manage
it.
the
only
people
who
have
right
to
collect,
that's
owed
to
the
body
of
the
trust,
the
only
persons
who
have
right
to
sue
for
those
rights.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
believe
they
in
fact
held
that
it
was
an
express
trust.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
by
analogy,
the
court
below
referred
to
the
limited
partners
in
a
--
in
a
limited
partnership
that
is
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
general
partners
have
the
citizenship
that
counts
for
purposes
of
a
suit
in
the
name
of
that
partnership.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
general
partners,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
they
have
no
rights
in
that
regard
at
all.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
they
do
have
that
right
on
a
majority
vote.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it's
fundamentally
different.
i
believe
it
is
essentially
the
same.
the
question
then
is
who
sued
in
this
case?
we
think
this
is
the
test
that
is
most
simple,
most
basic
and
most
correct.
who
sued?
who
are
the
real
plaintiffs?
if
it's
an
in
--
some
individuals
who
sued
and
if
there
is
no
need
for
adjustment
of
the
parties
by
adding
or
subtracting
parties
or
realigning
the
parties
that
is
if
the
people,
the
individuals
who
sued
are
real
parties
and
interest
with
capacity
to
sue,
then
it
is
their
citizenship
that
governs
and
at
this
case,
we
contend,
is
decided
by
that
principle.
if
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
a
name
that
sues
fidelity
mortgage
investors
in
this
case,
the
court
must
determine
who
it
is
that
is
behind
that
name.
whose
citizenship
must
govern?
in
that
regard,
we
think
that
it
would
be
proper
to
look
to
the
state
law
and
to
the
documents
establishing
that
trust
or
limited
partnership
to
determine
who
has
the
right
to
sue
as
between
the
beneficiaries
and
the
trustee
on
the
one
hand,
who
can
be
sued,
who
has
limited
liability,
who
has
unlimited
liability,
who
has
the
right
to
transact
business
from
which
the
controversy
arose.
who
is
the
agent
for
whom?
and
by
looking
at
those
principles,
it
can
be
determined
that
in
this
case,
the
real
people
who
sued
even
if
it
was
fmi,
the
fidelity
mortgage
investors
who
brought
the
suit,
was
the
trustees
not
the
beneficiaries.
the
marshall
decision
cited
by
the
defendants
in
the
court
below,
in
fact
seemed
to
imply
or
at
least
it
can
be
read
to
imply
that
even
with
regard
to
a
corporation,
it
is
the
directors
and
officers
whose
citizenship
governs.
i'll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
the
language
in
that
decision
is
not
clear
when
the
--
this
court
created
a
conclusive
presumption
that
a
corporation
has
its
citizenship
for
diversity
purposes
in
the
state
of
its
incorporation.
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
court
was
presuming
citizenship
of
the
directors
and
officers
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
it
was
presuming
the
citizenship
of
the
shareholders
on
the
other,
i
believe
it
can
be
read
either
way,
but
if
it
is
read
in
the
former,
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
--
with
all
of
the
analysis
that
we're
suggesting
to
the
court.
we
think
that
the
analysis
that
we
are
requesting
the
court
to
adopt
is
consistent
and
supportive
of
the
basic
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
--
the
beneficial
shareholders
in
this
case
will
not
be
revealed
or
participate
or
revealed
to
the
parties
or
--
excuse
me,
to
the
court
or
to
the
jury,
nor
will
they
participate
as
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuit.
it
is
not
realistic
we
think
to
hold
that
they
are
really
the
parties
to
this
lawsuit,
that
they
are
really
the
parities
whose
citizenship
governs
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
they
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
say,
your
honor.
under
the
trust
document,
they
have
not
right
to
participate
in
that
decision.
it's
the
trustees
alone
who
may
do
that.
the
rule
that
we
are
suggesting
is
a
simple
and
realistic
approach.
it
requires
no
analysis
of
the
birth
naturalization
and
domicile
of
those
9500
people
who
are
uninvolved
in
this
transaction
and
in
this
litigation.
we
submit
then,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
but
if
we
have
a
--
a
second
position
that
i
would
brief
--
briefly
mention
your
honors
and
that
is
this.
that
if
the
metaphysical
question
is
decided
that
this
way
that
it
really
is
the
9500
share
who
--
holders
who
are
the
real
patties
here
and
who
should
have
sued
or
who
should
be
the
parties,
the
three
plaintiff
individuals
who
are
beneficial
shareholders,
alternatively
brought
this
action
as
representatives
of
all
of
the
other
shareholders.
rule
23.2
of
the
federal
rules,
specifically
provides
that
as
an
alternative
method
for
--
for
creating
diversity
jurisdiction,
when
it
is
an
unincorporated
association.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
--
we
do
not
agree
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
shareholders
are
the
rights
that
issue
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
cannot
be.
if
--
if
our
assumption
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
alternative
argument.
our
primary
argument
is
that
it
is
the
trustees
whose
citizenship
governs.
it
is
the
trustees
who
are
the
real
parties.
our
alternative
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
were
surprised
when
this
case
was
dismissed,
that
is
our
alternatives
argument,
we
think
our
major
argument
is
the
--
is
the
proper
position
to
take
in
the
case.
in
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
again
that
is
another
alternative
argument
that
we
have
and
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
--
excuse
me.
the
--
the
trial
court
failed
to
--
to
develop
the
record
or
to
allow
any
development
of
the
record,
before
it
decided
that
there
was
no
federal
question
in
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
any
determination
of
the
propriety
of
that
and
we
would
merely
say
that
if
the
court
should
conclude
here
that
there
is
no
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
the
case
should
at
least
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
determination
of
the
federal
question.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
if
the
fifth
circuit
determines
that
there
is
a
federal
question
alleged
in
the
case,
then
it
should
remand
the
case
for
trial
and
development
of
that
federal
question.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
it
should
remand
it
for
a
trial
on
the
--
on
the
issue
of
which
it
has
jurisdiction
namely,
the
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
of
course
it
also
has
pendent
jurisdiction
in
that
instance
to
all
causes
of
action
arising
out
of
the
same
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
if
pendent
to
the
federal
claim,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
don't
believe
there
is
discretion.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
must
entertain
it.
if
it
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
that
the
court
does
have
pendent
jurisdiction
over
--
mr.
james
a.
ellis,
jr.
your
honor,
and
you
may
be
correct
on
that.
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case
at
this
time.
in
conclusion,
we
would
merely
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit.
we
think
the
reasoning
there
is
proper,
correct
and
practical
and
reaches
a
just
conclusion.
thank
you.
