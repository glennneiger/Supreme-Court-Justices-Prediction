--
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
my
--
my
question
was
not
so
much
that
the
morrissey
case
may
not
have
relied
on
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
that
perhaps,
it
may
have
been
wrong
in
relying
on
the
internal
revenue
code.
since
we
do
have
a
diversity
jurisdiction
and
for
fairly,
carefully
defined
statute
setting
out
what
shall
be
this
test
and
for
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
why
go
to
the
internal
revenue
clauses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
agree
to
the
place
for
contraction
of
the
–
diversity
jurisdiction
should
be
addressed
to
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
when
you
at
least
say,
“by
the
court
trust,”
are
you
using
the
term,
“trust”
to
mean
massachusetts
business
trust
as
opposed
to
corporation
or
individual,
as
a
method
of
doing
business?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
trust
a
--
a
person
or
a
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
in
the
9500
other
people
who
have
some
sort
of
interest
--
simply
have
interest
in
the
corpus
of
the
--
of
the
trust.
they
have
no
right
to
manage
or
convey
proper,
that
sort
of
thing.
