one
difference
i
suppose
with
the
union
is
that
–
for
most
its
litigation
–
not
every
case
because
bouligny
teaches
to
the
country.
most
of
its
litigation,
it
probably
has
a
federal
question
that
it
can
assert
and
when
it
sues
an
employer
under
the
--
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
isn't
an
awful
lot
of
litigation
by,
with
unions
that
requires
--
it's
based
on
diversity
is
there,
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens

justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.

mr.
ellis,
do

members
of
the

have
any
rights
as
individuals?
isn't
the
right
if
it
exist,
the
right
in
the
entity?
i
mean,
how
can
you
have
this
a
class
action
in
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
not
a
--
then
it
can't
be
a
class
action
on
their
behalf,
can
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
is
the
merit
--
then
is
the
merit
to
your
alternative
argument.
