mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
bernus
fischman
of
houston,
texas
for
the
petitioner,
navarro
savings.
your
honors,
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
held
that
the
citizenship
of
a
massachusetts
business
trust,
in
this
case,
a
real
estate
investment
trust,
was
that
of
each
of
its
trustees
as
opposed
to
its
some
9500
beneficial
shareholders.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
case
although
one
of
first
impression
on
the
narrow
point
now
before
this
court,
that
is
as
to
a
real
estate
investment
trust
as
a
particular
species
of
business
organization,
although
it
is
a
case
of
first
impression
that
it
is
well
governed
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
the
--
the
principal
decision
or
pair
of
decisions
which
believe
are
governing
in
this
case
are
morrissey
versus
commissioner,
cited
in
the
brief,
and
that
of
united
steelworkers
versus
r.h.
bouligny
and
company.
the
bouligny
case
–
well,
let
me
do
it
first
with
morrissey.
morrissey
holds
that
a
real
estate
investment
trust
is
an
association
as
opposed
to
some
other
species
of
entity.
it
says
in
effect
in
the
–
the
holding
of
the
case
is
that
it
would
be
taxed
as
an
association
under
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
morrissey
case
is
addressed
particularly
to
the
statutory
construction
of
the
internal
revenue
act,
but
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
a
case
and
we
say
this
in
our
brief.
the
case
does
not
confine
itself
to
application
on
the
narrow
issue
of
what
is
this
entity
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
what
it
does
say
is
this
entity
is
a
business
trust
and
we
will
treat
as
such
incidentally
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
don't
believe
we're
looking
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
your
honor,
to
determine
where
the
jurisdiction
lies.
as
we
say
in
the
brief,
it's
really
a
two
–
a
two-point
analysis.
all
morrissey
says
is,
“this
entity
is
a
business
association.”
we're
not
going
to
treat
it
as
a
conventional
trust,
because
it
has
the
features
of
continuity
or
perhaps
perpetual
life.
it
has
the
features
of
transferability
of
interest.
it's
an
active,
ongoing
business
organization
that
has
the
object
of
making
money
and
distributing
the
gains
to
the
--
the
beneficial
interest
holders.
it's
not
a
trust.
that's
all
that
we
say
morrissey
holds.
to
find
out
where
the
jurisdiction
lies,
one
must
then
look
to
the
bouligny
case,
which
is
in
itself
only
the
natural
outcropping
of
it's
antecedents,
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
in
chapman
versus
barney
in
1887
i
believe,
decision
of
this
court,
in
which
it
was
held
as
a
matter
noticed
by
the
court
as
opposed
to
anything
that
was
suggested
by
either
of
the
parties
in
their
--
in
their
briefs
that
--
that
the
district
court
or
excuse
me,
the
circuit
court
at
that
time
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
the
--
the
entity
there
was
–
it's
called
an
express
company.
it
was
in
essence,
of
joint-stock
association
and
therefore,
as
it
has
been
characterized,
a
--
a
mere
partnership.
and
the
court
said,
“we
must
look
to
the
citizenship
of
each
of
the
constituent
members
of
this
entity
that
have
aggregated
themselves
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
business.
the
next
case
to
come
along
was
the
great
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
none
whatever,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
the
basic
principle
is
one
that
is
--
adheres
from
the
earliest
concepts
of
our
federal
–
our
--
our
system
of
federalism
which
is,
at
ordinarily,
this
cases
belong
in
the
state
courts
and
this
was
pointed
out
in
the
carlsberg
decision
we've
--
we
cited
in
our
brief.
that
there
is
a
–
this
federalism
concept
that
says
these
cases
belong
in
the
state
courts,
unless
there
is
a
good
reason
they
belong
in
the
federal
courts.
if
you
go
back
to
the
--
the
problems
that
this
court
--
in
the
antecedents
that
this
court
had
in
--
in
wrenching
with
the
decision
of
what
to
do
with
corporations,
they
were
artificial
persons.
they
had
no
citizenship
of
their
own.
so
originally,
in
bank
versus
deveaux,
the
court
said,
“we're
going
--
we're
not
going
to
treat
them
as
--
as
an
entity.
we're
going
look
to
the
citizenship.”
the
court
then
reversed
itself
in
the
next
case.
and
then
finally,
in
the
marshall
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
case,
the
court
said,
“all
right,
we're
going
to
treat
this
entity
as
being
comprised
of
its
individual
shareholders,
its
beneficial
interest
holders,
but
we're
going
to
indulge
in
the
fiction
that
all
of
these
people
reside
in
the
state
of
incorporation.”
now,
this
persisted
until
the
1958
amendments
to
the
judicial
code
which
said,
“we're
now
going
to
codify
that
fiction,”
but
there
has
been
no
other
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
recognize
real
estate
investment
trust,
limited
partnership,
joint-stock
associations
or
other
forms
of
unincorporated
associations.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
this
is
true,
your
honor.
but,
if
we
look
to
the
bouligny
case,
we
find
that
a
labor
union
is
certainly
a
type
of
entity
that
i
don't
believe
existed
in
any
great
quantity
during
the
--
the
early
part
of
the
development
of
this
country.
the
labor
unions
became
strong,
really
as
entities
at
the
beginning
of
this
century.
in
the
bouligny
case
this
court
said
–
speaking
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
we
will
not
extend
this
rule
to
comprehend
the
labor
union.
we
will
not
indulge
in
the
same
fiction
for
the
labor
union
that
we
have
indulged
in
a
corporation
and
the
court
could
conveniently
say
that
i
think,
because
at
that
time
the
corporation
had
been
treated
by
congress.
and
this
is
why
the
opinion
says
that
please,
for
extension
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
--
what
the
respondents
have
argued
here
in
–
a
part
of
their
brief,
we
finally
get
down
to
it
and
they
say,
“this
is
what
the
rule
ought
to
be.”
this
court
should
create
a
fictional
citizenship
for
this
one
particular
type
of
entity,
a
massachusetts
business
trust.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
don't
believe
it
would
represent
a
contraction,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
the
rule
traditionally
has
been
that
it
must
be
the
citizenship
of
the
individual
person
and
not
an,
aggregations
of
persons.
i
don't
believe
it's
contracting
the
–
the
federal
jurisdiction,
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
think
unquestionably,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
carlsberg
court
treated
–
this
was
a
third
circuit
decision
and
the
carlsberg
court
said
that
it
would
in
fact
be
expansive
of
a
--
of
the
jurisdiction.
the
court
says
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
no.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
the
instant
case.
there
are
other
cases,
your
honor,
and
we
have
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
the
second
circuit
has
not
ruled
directly
on
this
issue.
the
second
circuit
concerned
itself
with
a
case
called
colonial
realty
versus
bache
&
company.
and
that
case
did
not
deal
with
the
massachusetts
business
trust.
it
dealt
with
a
limited
partnership.
now
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
it
did,
your
honor,
and
it
care
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
it
should
have
been
and
arguably
that
case
is
wrong.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
we
believe,
clearly
it
was.
the
--
the
bache
or
colonial
realty
versus
bache
case
has
been
extensively
criticized
in
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
the
carlsberg
court,
carlsberg
versus
cambria
savings
&
loan.
now,
that
case
likewise
involved
a
--
a
limited
partnership.
and
what
the
court
said
is,
“we
are
unwilling
to
engraft
upon
traditional
diversity
principles,
the
provisions
of
rule
17
to
determine
diversity,
to
determine
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
rule
17,
if
it
does,
do
that
and
perhaps
it
conflicts
with
rule
82
under
the
construction
that
the
respondents
have
argued
for,
rule
17
would
become
in
effect,
a
jurisdictional
rule
as
opposed
to
one
that
merely
determines
the
capacity
of
the
party.
and
i
think
that's
what
rule
17
was
directed
at.
the
–-
the
--
it
seems
that
the
respondents
have
sort
of
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
they're
saying,
“let
us
look
to
rule
17
to
determine
where
the
jurisdiction
is
and
then
we'll
see
if
there's
diversity.”
it
doesn't
make
sense.
and
this
is
what
the
court
in
carlsberg
looked
at
and
as
the
respondents
concede
in
their
brief,
there
really
is
no
practically
difference
between
the
limited
partnership
and
the
real
estate
investment
trust.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
just
a
moment
and
discuss
the
--
the
cases
that
were
cited
extensively
by
the
respondent.
the
--
the
several
lines
of
cases,
dodge
versus
tulleys,
wyoming
and
susquehanna
railroad
versus
blatchford,
and
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
well,
we're
–-
of
course
we're
here,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
because
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
point
of
the
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
it
certainly
would
have
a
telling
effect
upon
it.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
it
certainly
would.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
will
see
any
distinction
between
the
second
circuit
case
and
this
case.i
--
i
honestly
don't
see
any
distinction
between
the
limited
partnership
and
the
real
estate
investment
trust.
they
all
have
continuity
of
interest.
they
all
have
a
--
a
body
of
shareholders
who
have
delegated
to
a
group
of
trustees,
curators,
managers,
directors,
whatever
you
would
call
them,
the
managerial
duties
of
their
entity.
but
it
doesn't
change
the
basic
fact
that
they're
the
real
parties
and
interest
in
this
case,
if
real
party
and
interest
analysis
is
indeed,
even
the
correct
way
to
approach
the
case.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
there
are
any
practical
distinctions
in
the
two.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
think
that
may
be
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
what
they're
doing
then
is
they're
engrafting
or
they're
establishing
there,
a
whole
new
species
of
quasi-corporation
if
you
will,
into
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
show
that
when
it
has
reached
this
court,
the
court
has
held
that
the
citizenship
of
the
unincorporated
association
as
that
of
its
members.
i
think
to
say
otherwise,
is
to
in
effect,
overrule
bouligny
at
least
implicitly
and
create
for
the
labor
union,
for
example,
a
form
of
a
second
class
citizenship.
i
can't
really
see
any
--
any
distinction
between
the
modern
labor
union
and
the
modern
business
trust.
they
are
both
comprised
of
aggregates
of
--
of
people,
of
citizens,
of
live
human
beings
who
come
together
under
one
banner
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
their
business
and
accruing
gains
or
benefits
to
the
party.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i'm
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i'm
--
i'm
really
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
could
only
say
this,
“in
the
bouligny
case,
the
--
the
issue
involved
a
libel
brought
by
the
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
--
company
against
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
--
the
union
which
was
clearly
a
state-created
right
and
clearly
belonged
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
state
unless
there
was
some
bona
fide
basis
for
them.
we
want
to
respond
briefly
to
the
--
the
cases
that
deal
with
the
trust.
several
of
these
cases
that
are
cited,
i
think
are
distinguishable
on
the
fact
that
all
of
the
parties
did
in
fact
have
diverse
citizenship,
even
including
the
beneficial
interest
holders
and
including
the
trustees.
that's
the
case
of
the
dodge
versus
tulleys
and
bullard
versus
city
of
cisco.
in
those
cases,
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
trustees
in
this
case,
you
already
had
diversity
anyway,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
points
made
in
those
cases
are
necessary
for
the
decision
that
was
ultimately
made.
in
the
wyoming
and
susquehanna
case
blatchford,
the
--
the
court
held
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
because
the
trustee
in
the
case
did
have
the
same
citizenship
as
one
of
the
defendants.
they
were
both
residents
of
pennsylvania.
so
i
don't
know
how
much
those
cases
furnish
a
--
a
dichotomy
between
the
line
of
cases
of
bouligny,
chapman
versus
barney,
great
southern
fire
proof
hotel,
which
was
a
case
that
involved
a
limited
partnership
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
is
nearly
as
i
can
see,
squarely
conflicts
with
the
second
circuit
case
which
this
court
denied
sort
on,
but
certainly
did
not
hear
and
--
and
affirmed.
i'll
save
the
balance
of
time,
your
honors,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
would
seem
that
the
--
the
primary
question
that's
developed
here
is
exactly
what
it
fidelity
mortgage
investors,
is
it
an
entity?
is
it
an
unincorporated
association?
is
it
an
aggregation
of
individual
or
just
what?
the
--
the
entity
is
in
fact,
an
unincorporated
business
association.
it
is
not
a
trust
in
the
traditional
sense
of
an
express
trust.
it
may
call
itself
one,
but
if
one
reads
--
reads
carefully,
the
declaration
of
trust
in
this
case,
one
could
find
that
this
entity
can
be
almost
anything
it
wants
to
be
because,
for
example,
in
--
as
pointed
out
in
the
declaration
of
trust
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
briefs.
the
--
the
trust
can
delegate
or
that
excuse
me,
the
trustees
have
the
power
to
delegate
their
authority
to
anyone
of
their
membership
--
anyone
of
the
trustees
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
the
same
power,
mr.
justice
is
that
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
precisely
the
same
power
which
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation
have
and
that
is
by
whatever
the
appropriate
majority
is
to
vote
out
the
people
that
are
either
defending
a
lawsuit
that
they
would
like
compromised
or
to
compel
the
institution
of
a
lawsuit
that
they
want.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
economic
functions
of
a
real
estate
investment
trust
and
the
modern
corporation
or
for
that
matter
a
limited
partnership
or
general
partnership
such
as
a
joint-stock
association.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
precisely,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
only
by
active
--
by
originally
by
judicial
fiat
of
this
court
by
creating
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
and
now
by
a
statute.
our
whole
point
is
centered
on
the
fact
that
this
might
be
a
wonderful
argument.
it
might
be
just
an
absolutely
magnificent
idea
for
real
estate
investment
trust
to
have
access
to
a
federal
form,
but
it's
up
to
congress
to
make
that
determination
as
this
court
has
aptly
determined
in
the
bouligny
case.
i
would
think
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
only
in
the
sense
that
the
labor
union
is
not
organized
in
the
ultimate
sense
for
a
financial
profit,
but
it
does
have
as
its
goal,
the
distribution
of
benefits
to
its
membership.
it
is
ongoing.
it
has
business.
it
has
officers.
it
has
members
who
control
ultimately
the
decisions
of
its
managers,
its
presidents,
its
stewards.
so
in
that
sense,
there
really
is
no
real
difference.
i
think
if
the
court
here
extends
diversity
jurisdiction
in
effect
and
expands
it
to
accommodate
the
massachusetts
business
trust,
you
create
an
infinite
possibility
for
deceptive
practices
if
you
will,
to
create
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
is
as
clearly
an
issue
which
the
court
will
have
to
confront.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
--
that
this
particular
lawsuit
was
not
originally
commenced
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
it
was
commenced
in
the
state
district
court
in
dallas,
texas.
and
only
when
a
plea
of
privilege
was
sustained
to
transferring
this
case
to
the
county
in
which
navarro
has
its
headquarters,
was
the
suit
dropped
and
refiled
in
the
northern
district.
so,
some
of
the
argument
that
there
is
the
local
prejudice
doesn't
completely
reign
through.
it
was
the
particular
forum
within
the
state
of
texas
that
the
--
that
the
respondents
were
seeking
to
--
to
invoke.
now,
this
court
must
consider
the
marshall
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
case,
where
it
was
simply
stated
that
in
creating
this
fiction,
we're
not
going
to
disregard
the
fact
that
the
corporators
and
those
were
in
fact
the
people
who
were
referred
to
in
that
opinion,
i
--
i
can
understand
counsel's
confusion
with
that
term
with
the
corporators
as
used
in
that
--
that
somewhat
quaint
or
antiquated
language,
simply
means
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation
where
the
ones
whose
residents
would
be
looked
to,
to
determine
citizenship
for
diversity
purposes.
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
you
must
in
order
to
hold
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
you
must
overrule
marshall
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad.
you
must
implicitly
overrule
bouligny
and
the
cases
which
are
in
its
antecedents.
and
i
think
you
will
do
so
with
all
the
attendant
risk
that
you
will
increase
the
--
the
litigation
which
will
be
filed
in
federal
forms
as
a
direct
result
of
that
--
of
that
holding.
i
would
also
respectfully
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
--
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
it
and
--
of
course
it
doesn't
appear
particularly
from
the
record
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
all
of
the
trustees
of
the
massachusetts
business
trust
are
before
the
court,
but
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
argument
which
respondents
advanced
that
all
of
the
trustees
be
before
the
court.
supposing,
for
example,
they
had
several
trustees
who
were
residents
of
the
state
of
texas,
it
would
be
rather
convenient
to
simply
ignore
their
existence
and
bring
the
--
the
action
in
the
name
of
only
those
trustees
who
were
non-texas
residence.
and
there
is
nothing
in
what
the
respondents
argue
that
would
make
that
in
effect,
a
collusive
joinder
to
confer
jurisdiction.
it's
simply
an
omission
to
bring
forward
those
parties
who
would
in
effect,
destroy
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
the
--
the
trust
cases,
the
express
trust
cases
dodge
versus
tulleys,
first,
as
we
pointed
out,
we
believe,
we
respectfully
submit,
are
distinguishable,
an
express
trust
in
the
sense
of
a
mortgage
indenture
or
in
the
case
of
dodge
versus
tulleys
or
--
excuse
me,
bullard
versus
city
of
cisco,
you
had
a
bondholders
committee.
but
that
bondholders
committee
was
organized
for
one
limited
purpose
and
also,
all
of
the
shareholders,
a
close
reading
of
the
case,
says
that
the
persons
who
elected
to
join
with
the
bondholders
committee,
number
one,
had
citizenship
diverse
from
all
of
the
--
the
defendants,
that
was
the
first
point.
moreover,
all
of
those
bondholders
who
contributed
their
bonds
to
the
committee
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
unquestionably,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
by
simply
voting
out
the
trustees,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
don't
follow
the
court's
question.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
you
mean
as
individuals?
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
because
the
delegation
is
merely
the
creature
of
those
parties.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
it
doesn't
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
because
in
--
we're
obtaining
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
they
have
not
because
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
--
they
have
not,
but
they
ultimately
as
the
true
parties
and
interest,
if
that
is
indeed
the
appropriate
analysis
at
all,
have
that
power
simply
by
removing
those
trustees.
totally
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
no,
that's
true.
they
have
not
in
this
case.
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
but
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
believe
that
the
point
is
that
they
may
do
it
in
--
in
positing
that
power
in
the
shareholders,
you
make
them
no
different
than
the
shareholders
of
a
corporation.
but
the
only
reason
that
a
shareholder
of
a
corporation
--
it
was
not
a
party
and
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
but
i
would
--
mr.
bernus
wm.
fischman
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
means
that
you
then
refer
the
federal
court
to
the
law
of
the
states
to
determine
federal
jurisdiction,
which
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
ever
held,
was
properly
the
function
of
the
federal
form.
the
--
the
--
it
is
pointed
out
in
the
carlsberg
case
that
jurisdiction
has
to
appear
from
the
record
itself.
it
has
to
be
there
to
begin
with.
under
--
under
that
particular
argument,
the
only
reason
that
a
corporation
has,
if
you
will,
a
birth
certificate,
is
because
the
state
gave
it
one.
that's
fine.
but
that
is
--
does
not
change
the
ultimate
fact
that
the
corporation
metaphysically
exist
only
in
the
contemplation
of
the
law.
it
doesn't
exist.
i
can't
reach
out
and
touch
the
corporation.
i
can
only
reach
out
and
touch
individuals
who
own
property
and
who
have
some
conflict
with
my
client.
what
i
cannot
see
is
any
difference
between
that
type
of
entity
and
the
corporation.
it's
the
same
thing.
and
the
only
thing
that
gives
a
corporation
the
right
to
be
there
is
because
originally,
a
court-created
fiction
and
then
ultimately,
an
act
of
congress.
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
