and
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
navarro
savings
association
against
lee.
mr.
fischman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
talking
about
the
1887
case
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
changes
in
modes
of
doing
business
in
that
time
with
this
was
anything
to
do
with
how
would
this
case
should
be
viewed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
point
you've
just
said
suggested
–
suggest
at
least
to
me,
that
over
the
last
century
the
--
the
varying
modes
of
business
and
practices
have
been
reflected
in
decisions
of
the
courts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
all
practical
purposes,
what
do
you
regard
as
the
differences
between
a
corporation
with
--
with
directors
and
9500
stockholders
and
this
situation,
practical
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
think
of,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
that
–-
that's
been
going
on
over
the
last
100
years
hasn't
it,
to
some
extent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ellis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
assume
all
these
trustees
are
shareholders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
had
to
choose
between
the
two
alternatives,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
gave
you,
wouldn't
you
say
it's
a
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
entity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
do
have
the
right
to
take
out
trustees
tomorrow
if
they
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
fundamentally
different
do
you
think
from
the
rate
of
stockholders
to
dismiss
directors
or
no?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
have
anything
to
say
about
whether
the
lawsuits
should
be
brought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fischman,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
should
think
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
labor
union
and
all
the
other
categories
we've
been
talking
about?
