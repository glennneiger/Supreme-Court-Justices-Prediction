justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
you
think
that
this
decision
expanded
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
circuit
court
case
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
to
–
except
the
one
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
gave
the
limited
partnership
a
separate
existence,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
traditionally
–-
and
that
would
have
been
subject
to
the
individual
membership
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
an
--
that
was
an
expansion
of
jurisdiction
too,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
have
taken
the
second
circuit
case
and
affirmed
it,
i
suppose
you
would
--
would
probably
be
wouldn't
even
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
(voice
overlap)
it
--
it
might
not
have
petitioned.
do
you
think,
if
we
happen
to
–
if
we
--
if
we
had
previously
agreed
with
the
second
circuit
in
a
limited
partnership
case,
would
that
have
ruled
this
case,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
test
you're
proposing,
real
party
and
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
call
itself
when
it
issues
things
to
its
shareholders
if
--
over
their
interest
--
over
its
interest
holders?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
beneficiaries.
what
are
they
--
what
does
it
call
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
usual
room
for
express
trust
isn't
it
that
the
trustees
can
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wasn't
--
but
that
wasn't
the
--
that
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
below,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
them,
first
of
all,
did
it
analogize
it
to
the
express
trust?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
it's
a
--
and
it's
also
like
the
limited
partners
in
a
limited
partnership?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
being
the
ones
who
--
who
had
the
citizenship
pursued.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
the
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
and
then
what?
where
there's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what,
on
what,
on
the
federal
question
or
on
some
pendent
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
issue
--
the
--
the
thing
you
want
tried
is
really
a
pendent
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
not
a
--
there's
some
discretion
as
to
whether
it
was
--
to
whether
--
to
entertain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what,
a
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
question
and
therefore,
you
must
entertain
pendent
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
--
yes,
you
have
it
--
you
have
it,
if
you
want
to
exercise
it.
do
you
think
there
some
--
some
requirement
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
so
but
--
but
short
of
that,
what
power
does
an
individual
member
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
to
vote
out
the
trustees?
