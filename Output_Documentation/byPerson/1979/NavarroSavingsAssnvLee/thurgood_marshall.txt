and
what
basis
is
that
for,
to
get
the
same
jury?
it's
same
people
in
--
on
the
juries?
justice

any
formal
--
any
article
iii

let's
not
get
discussing
what
we
don't
know
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
decisions
are
raised
on
this
agreement,
give
to
the
trustee's
right
to
file
a
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
retain
that
that
be
given
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean,
how
can
you
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
you
delegated
the
trustees
the
right
to
control,
to
sue
and
what
have
you.
why
do
you
now
have
the
right
to
be
in
a
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
action
have
you
done
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
to
withdraw
that
delegation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
withdrawn
it
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
haven't
done
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
can
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
tell
me
about
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
another
difference.
a
corporation
has
a
state
statute
declaring
it
to
be
a
corporation
and
given
it
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
have
that.
