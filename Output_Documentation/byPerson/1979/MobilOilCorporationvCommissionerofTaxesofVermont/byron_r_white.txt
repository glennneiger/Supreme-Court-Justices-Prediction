justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
objecting
here
at
the
very
outset
of
even
including
in
the
base
this
dividend
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
the
same
--
are
you
making
the
same
argument
or
would
you
with
respect
to
dividend
income
from
the
united
states
subsidiaries?
say
mobil
does
all
its
business
in
alaska
through
subsidiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
a
domestic
commerce,
you
know.
we
have
an
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't,
but
some
other
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
would
certainly
apply
to
domestic
subsidiaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
why
wouldn't
the
commerce
argument
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
an
interstate
commerce
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
without
--
would
they
have
to
treat
you
as
a
unitary
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
new
york
if
they
attempted
to
include
the
dividends
but
not
all
the
properties
in
the
factor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
even
if
new
york
just
attempted
to
apply
its
regular
income
tax
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
object
if
new
york
attempted
to
apply
a
normal
income
tax
statute
to
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
include
the
dividend
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
purport
to
say
this
is
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
new
york
as
an
investment
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hellerstein,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
would
follow
up
on
a
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
raise
my
voice.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
king,
supposing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
throw
this
out
and
you
answer
it
together,
because
it's
very
close,
really.
supposing
the
stock
had
not
been
subsidiaries
but
had
been
stock
in,
say,
the
dupont
company
or
something
like
that.
would
you
also
include
it,
dividends
from
that
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
include
any
property,
why
do
you
have
a
property
factor?
i
mean,
none
of
this
is
tax
on
a
property,
but
you
include
some
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
include
all
of
the
dividends
from
the
stock.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
allocating,
you
are
taking
it
--
what
is
the
denominator
in
that,
total
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
include
in
that
the
value
of
shares
owned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
keep
saying
that,
but
i
don't
understand
it.
i
don't
know
why
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
denominator
is
total
property,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
denominator
is
total
property,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i'm
just
asking
you,
why
not
--
if
you're
talking
about
the
total
property,
why
do
you
exclude
the
intangibles
from
the
total
property
that
you
use
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dexter,
the
denominator
doesn't
have
any
relevance
to
where
the
property
is
located.
that's
the
total.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
time
you
need
to
know
where
the
property
is
is
in
the
numerator,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
taking,
in
the
numerator,
the
property
that's
located
in
vermont?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you've
said
a
hundred
times
already
that
the
intangible
isn't
located
in
vermont,
but
you
do
know
that
mobil
owns
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you
this
way
if
you
included
in
the
denominator
the
value
of
the
shares
that
mobil
owns
in
its
subsidiary
but
didn't
take
any
part
of
that,
didn't
assign
any
part
of
that
to
vermont
in
the
numerator,
it
would
make
a
difference,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
wouldn't
like
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
doubt
if
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
there?
