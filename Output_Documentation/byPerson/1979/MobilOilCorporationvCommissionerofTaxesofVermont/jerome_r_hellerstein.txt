mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
mobil
oil
corporation
from
a
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
holding
that
dividends
received
by
mobil
from
its
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
which
operated
exclusively
in
foreign
countries
and
derived
virtually
all
their
income
from
sources
outside
the
united
states,
that
such
dividends
were
properly
includable
in
the
apportionable
base
of
the
vermont
tax.
that's
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
now,
the
facts
are
these.
mobil
is
a
new
york
corporation.
its
corporate
headquarters
and
commercial
domicile
are
located
in
new
york
city.
it
is
engaged
in
all
aspects
of
the
petroleum
business
including
exploration,
production
of
oil
and
gas,
refining,
transportation,
and
sale
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products.
now,
the
only
activities
carried
on
in
vermont
consisted
of
the
wholesale
and
retail
marketing
of
products.
mobile
is
subject
to
taxes
measured
by
net
income
not
only
in
the
state
of
vermont,
but
in
40
other
states,
as
well
as
the
district
of
columbia.
the
company
is
engaged
in
both
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
now,
with
respect
to
these
stocks,
mobil
owned
the
stocks
of
a
large
number
of
corporations,
subsidiaries
and
affiliates,
and
as
i
have
said,
they
carried
on
their
business
solely
in
foreign
countries.
these
dividends
that
are
here
in
issue
constituted
most
of
mobil's
taxable
income.
now,
99
percent
of
the
dividends
were
derived
from,
received
from
corporations
that
derived
all
or
all
except
a
very
insignificant
portion
of
their
income
from
sources
outside
the
united
states.
mobil's
business
as
the
owner
of
these
stocks
was
in
all
respects
conducted
outside
vermont.
managed,
directed
offices
outside
vermont.
the
same
is
true
of
the
dividends.
the
receipt
of
the
dividends
and
the
disposition
of
the
dividends,
all
outside
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
yes,
sir?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
under
the
theory
we
are
presenting,
something
like
$4,000
for
the
three
years.
i'd
like
to
go
to
that,
your
honor,
because
the
commissioner
has
suggested
that
the
tax
of
$4,000
for
this
great
multinational
company
can
hardly
be
a
fair
representation
of
what
mobil
ought
to
pay
for
the
activities
carried
on
in
the
state.
well,
i
think
we
ought
to
remember
several
things.
the
vermont
legislature
imposed
an
income
tax,
and
when
the
vermont
legislature
imposed
that
income
tax
it
knew
perfectly
well
that
that
might
result
in
a
loss,
even
though
we
have
a
lot
of
property
and
assets
in
this
state.
the
commissioner,
in
making
this
very
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
you're
making,
$4,000
for
this
gargantuan
company
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
no,
there's
no
question
about
it.
it's
a
small
amount.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is,
that's
what
the
vermont
legislature
decided
was
a
fair
payment
of
the
income
tax.
but
this
isn't
the
only
tax
we
pay
in
vermont.
we're
subject
to
other
taxes.
property
taxes,
sales
taxes,
highway
use
taxes,
and
what-not.
so
that
the
smallness
of
this
amount
really
reflects
the
fact
that
mobil's
income
is
earned
from
dividends
that
are
all
outside
vermont,
for
all
practical
purposes.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that
raises
the
question,
were
those
dividends
taxed
by
any
other
state?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
where
were
they
taxed?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
by
no
state.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
let
me
explain
why.
they
were
taxed
--
the
state
of
new
york,
which
is
the
commercial
domicile
of
mobil,
has
a
policy
of
not
taxing
dividends
from
subsidiaries
at
all.
with
respect
to
non-subsidiaries,
it
reverts
the
tax,
takes
the
percentage
of
the
tax
as
to
where
the
income
was
earned.
so
with
respect
to
these
dividends
we
paid
little
or
no
tax.
but
now,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
gets
to
a
key
question
in
the
case.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
you're
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
we
did,
and
it
was
denied.
right.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised,
because
one
of
the
key
questions
in
the
case,
when
we
come
to
the
commerce
clause
argument,
in
which
we
contend
that
we
ought
not,
that
the
apportioned
tax
by
a
state,
by
vermont,
in
which
we
carry
on
no
aspect
of
these
operations,
that
none
of
those,
no
state
in
which
we
carry
on
our
operating
functions
as
distinguished
from
the
management
of
our
interest
in
the
stocks,
that
none
of
those
states
ought
to
be
able
to
apportion
that
income
because
you
would
have
a
risk
of
multiple
taxation,
either
the
risk
of
possible
double
taxation
as
a
result
of
the
taxing
power
of
the
commercial
domicile
or
business
situs,
if
that
was
the
state,
plus
the
apportioned
tax,
or
given
just
the
apportionment,
the
risk
of
diversity
of
taxation.
now,
let
me
go
first
to
this
question
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
raised.
the
doctrine,
as
your
honors
will
recall,
is
well
established.
the
multiple
taxation
doctrine
clearly,
as
developed
by
its
architects,
who
were
justices
stone,
rutledge,
later
extended
by
other
justices
of
the
court
--
there
isn't
any
question
but
that
that
doctrine
depended
on
the
following
proposition,
do
other
states
have
the
power
to
tax,
regardless
of
whether
they
exercise
it?
that's
clear.
everybody
recognizes
that.
however,
counsel
say
subsequent
opinions
of
this
court
have
modified
the
doctrine
so
that
the
multiple
taxation
doctrine
does
not
prevent
a
tax
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
unless
you
prove
you've
actually
been
double-taxed
by
another
state.
first
of
all,
an
analysis
of
the
case
does
not
support
the
view
that
that
doctrine
has
been
abandoned.
but
authority
aside,
i
want
to
go
to
the
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
abandoned
by
this
court,
and
there
are
two
sets
of
reasons,
your
honor.
one
are
pragmatic
and
one
are
matters
of
constitutional
principle.
first
as
to
the
pragmatic
objections
to
the
actual
multiple
taxation
test.
such
a
test
would
foster
a
competitive
race
among
state
legislatures,
and
tax
departments,
too,
to
be
the
first
to
tax
and
the
first
to
assess.
moreover,
inequalities
between
corporations
earning
the
same
amount
of
income
within
a
state
would
be
fostered.
why?
the
taxes
could
be
different
under
the
actual
multiple
taxation
test
because
of
different
taxes
that
each
of
them
pay
in
other
states.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
i
suggest
that
likewise
dictates
the
retention
of
the
power
to
tax.
what
are
we
dealing
with?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
sir?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
our
contention
is
this,
your
honor,
that
given
a
situation
in
which
all
the
operations
of
the
company,
vis
a
vis
the
management
of
the
stocks,
the
receipt
and
disposition
of
the
dividends,
when
all
of
those
take
place
outside
a
state,
typically
it
be
the
commercial
domicile,
our
contention
is
this.
one,
historically
the
tradition
of
state
taxation
was
to
allocate
those
in
full
to
the
commercial
domicile.
two,
that's
the
right
rule.
why
is
it
the
right
rule?
through
process
of
law
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
difference.
the
federal
constitution
has
never
interfered
with
a
state's
working
out
their
own
policies
to
attract
business,
or
to
make
life
livable.
that's
a
choice
that
every
state
has
and
should
have,
including
the
charting
of
its
tax
policy.
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it's
very
different
to
say,
very
different
to
say
one
state's
power
of
tax
is
going
to
be
increased
or
decreased
because
of
what
another
state
does.
each
of
the
states
can
use
its
own
policy
reasons
for
attracting
trade,
whether
it's
for
energy
purposes
or
whether
it's
to
make
management
central.
but
that's
the
substance
of
our
federal
constitutional
system.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
we
would
not
be
here
on
this
case.
the
reason
i
have
to
say
that
is,
we
might
be
here
on
a
later
case.
but
this
likewise
gets
to
one
of
the
gut
problems
in
the
case.
the
whole
pitch,
really,
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
this.
this
runs
through
all
their
briefs,
including
the
numerous
briefs
signed
by
their
and
my
side.
they
say
mobil
and
its
foreign
subsidiaries
and
the
foreign
affiliates
from
which
we
receive
dividends,
they're
really
all
part
of
one
unitary
international
petroleum
business.
and
so
it
doesn't
matter
that
these
stocks
were
not
handled,
no
part
of
the
handling
of
the
stocks
was
taken
care
of
in
the
state
of
vermont.
we
can
look
at
the
whole
system
and
we
can
take
into
account
the
fact
that
what
goes
on
in
the
middle
east
in
the
digging
for
oil
has
some
bearing
on
the
international
petroleum
business,
including
let's
say
the
marketing
of
oil
in
vermont.
that
is
one
of
the
methods
that
a
state
may
employ.
there
are
some
limitations.
you
have
to
avoid
distortions.
you
have
to
have
a
unitary
business.
but
if
vermont
had
treated
mobil
and
its
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
as
a
unitary
business
and
had
used
what
is
known
as
the
combined
method
of
reporting,
what
would
have
happened
would
have
been
this.
the
base
of
the
tax
would
be
all
the
income
of
all
these
companies
in
the
unitary
business
worldwide.
the
apportionment
factors,
properties,
payroll
receipts
that
determine
the
fraction
that
this
state
tax
is,
would
be
of
all
those
companies.
in
those
circumstances
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem,
but
there
would
be
a
different
problem
as
to
the
propriety
of
that.
but
that
isn't
our
case.
but
that
is
a
well
recognized
method.
vermont
does
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
white,
is
this.
vermont
doesn't
use
that
combined
method.
vermont
uses
the
separate
company
method.
vermont
doesn't
treat
the
companies
as
a
unitary
business,
else
there
wouldn't
be
any
dividends
to
tax.
that
if
you
are
going
to
treat
the
company,
mobil
as
a
separate
company,
taking
into
account
only
mobil's
own
income
and
only
mobil's
own
factors
and
giving
no
credit
to
the
fact
that
these
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
dividends
were
earned
entirely
outside
the
state,
that
the
stocks
were
managed
outside
the
state,
if
you're
going
to
--
you
can't
have
apples
and
oranges.
they
are
conflicting
methods.
if
you
want
to
tax
our
dividends,
you've
got
to
tax
us
as
the
owner
of
stocks
and
the
holder
of
these
dividends,
and
nothing
took
place
in
vermont
with
respect
to
them.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
we
are
making
the
same
arguments
would
apply
under
our
due
process
contention.
the
same
arguments
would
not
apply
under
our
foreign
commerce
clause
contention.
that
is,
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
domestic
dividends,
our
due
process
argument
would
be
applicable.
so
when
we
get
over
to
the
commerce
clause
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
right.
we
don't
have
any
dividends
here.
this
is
all
from
foreign
commerce.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
suppose
we
had
that
case,
as
your
honor
is
asking
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
then
i
am
saying
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
the
due
process
argument,
yes.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
because
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
the
due
process
argument,
the
reason
why
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
dividends
received,
if
they
were
here,
that
dividends
received
from
domestic
subsidiaries
could,
need
not,
are
not
apportionable,
is
this.
there
is
a
problem
as
to
whether
the
moorman
case
precludes
that
contention.
we
would
argue
it
does
not.
if
you
get
to
the
commerce
clause
argument,
mr.
justice
white,
as
distinguished
from
the
due
process
argument,
and
you
get
to
the
commerce
clause
argument,
we've
got
the
problem
that
moorman
took
the
position
with
respect
to
domestic
commerce,
that
is
interstate
commerce,
that
the
court
would
not
intervene
in
methods
of
apportionment.
we
argue
it's
a
jurisdictional
problem,
due
process.
but
if
that's
rejected
and
you
get
to
the
problem
that
this
is
something
that
involves
a
right
of
apportionment,
then
moorman
says
this
court
will
not
intervene
when
interstate
commerce
is
involved.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
here
have
the
benefit
of
a
decision
of
the
majority
of
the
court
in
japan
line
which
says
foreign
commerce
is
different.
foreign
commerce
is
more
sensitive.
the
majority
of
that
court,
whatever
else
you
may
say
about
japan
line,
in
which
i
am
aware
your
honor
dissented,
whatever
else
you
may
say
about
japan
line,
it
established
two
things
that
are
the
crux
of
this
case,
vis
a
vis
the
foreign
commerce
clause
problem,
mr.
justice
white,
as
distinguished
from
the
interstate
clause.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
those
are
two
things
it
established.
one,
foreign
commerce
is
much
more
sensitive
than
domestic
commerce,
and
the
tolerance
under
our
constitutional
principles
for
a
certain
amount
of
inequality
and
difference
and
double
taxation
that's
acceptable
in
domestic
commerce,
that
doesn't
go
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
it
would
have
to
use
a
totally
different
method
of
taxation,
that
given
this
method
of
taxation
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
and
their
tax,
your
honor,
has
to
be
judged
by
what
they
did.
they
didn't
tax
us
as
a
combined
company
on
a
unitary
basis,
and
they
can't
argue
here,
as
most
of
their
briefs
argue,
that
jurisdiction
to
tax
depends
on
being
a
unitary
business.
that
just
isn't
the
method
by
which
they
taxed
us.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
no.
here's
what
we're
saying,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
following
the
tradition
in
this
country
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
i'll
tell
you
why
we
wouldn't
make
that
argument,
your
honor.
i
see
no
difficulty
with
the
proposition
that
a
state
may
impose
a
tax
on
a
holding
or
investment
company
for
its
activities
in
connection
with
the
ownership
of
that
stock.
we're
not
arguing
that
no
state
may
impose
this
tax.
i
see
the
problem
of
dividend
income
as
very
different
from
operating
income.
they
are
very
different
problems.
and
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
proposition
that
a
state,
in
addition
to
taxing
operating
income,
may
impose
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
in
effect
as
a
holding
and
investment
company,
and
that's
the
commercial
domicile
typically.
so
we
wouldn't
argue
the
point,
your
honor,
you're
suggesting.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
necessity
of
eliminating
multiple
taxation
with
respect
to
foreign
dividends,
apart
from
the
due
process
problem,
that
a
state
like
vermont
has
no
connection
with
this
whole
matter,
that
that
necessity
makes
it
important
and
sound
as
a
matter
of
fiscal
policy,
sound
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
sound
under
the
necessity
of
avoiding
multiple
taxation,
to
limit
this
power
of
taxation
just
to
the
state
of
commercial
domicile
where
all
the
activities
take
place,
or
the
business
situs
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
didn't
quite
get
that.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
not
at
all.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that's
right.
no
problem
with
that.
i
think
that's
perfectly
reasonable.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
may
i
come
over
here,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
entirely
separate
business?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
they
sell
shoes.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
not
only
is
my
submission
that
no
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
thank
you
very
much.
now,
we
have
similar
problems.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
oh,
how
nice.
i
have
the
problems.
mr.
justice
stevens
asked,
as
usual,
an
important
question.
his
question
was
that
suppose
there
were
completely
separate
business
operated
in
some
other
state,
would
i
object
to
the
inclusion,
would
i
permit,
would
it
be
permissible
under
my
submission
to
include
that
item
in
the
unitary
business,
and
i
said
that
the
answer
is
no,
it
would
not
be,
and
that
no
state
does
it.
every
state
in
applying
the
unitary
principle
recognizes
that
you
cannot
combine
for
unitary
purposes
two
separate
businesses,
because
there
would
be
income
distortion.
does
that
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
very
good.
now,
very
good.
i
see
my
allotted
time
at
this
point
has
expired,
so
i
will
retire.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
one
of
the
cardinal
principles,
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
argument
of
the
other
side
in
effect
is
this.
if
you
are
dealing
with
apportionment,
everything
goes.
but
you
don't
have
to
have
a
due
process
connection.
between
the
items
included
in
the
apportionable
base
and
the
state,
that's
just
not
so.
the
cases
are
to
the
contrary.
the
cases
have
established
the
requirement
that
because
a
class
of
income,
for
example,
goes
into
a
base
of
the
tax,
typically,
that's
going
to
increase
the
tax
attributable
to
the
state.
not
always,
but
typically
so.
now,
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
courts
have
held
throughout
that
there
has
to
be
a
connection
between
the
types
of
income
that
are
included
and
the
taxing
state.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
of
course,
your
answer
--
it's
a
really
very
simple
proposition.
of
course
if
you
include
the
intangibles,
which
you
have
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
going
to
get
to
this
problem
of
allowing
apportionment
of
the
income
from
the
intangibles,
of
course
they
should
be
included
in
the
base.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
no,
they
don't
do
it.
they
don't
include
the
dividends
either
in
the
receipts
factor.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
we
asked
for
a
modification
on
the
basis
of
these
points,
and
they
denied
it.
now,
the
adams
express
case
has
been
cited
by
mr.
dexter
to
the
contrary
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
that
was
a
property
tax
case.
of
course
all
the
property
in
a
business,
unless
it
is
shown
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
sir?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
japan
line
was
--
excuse
me,
sir.
going
back
for
a
minute
to
adams
express,
it
was
a
capital
stock
case.
capital
stock
tax
measures
are
essentially
property
tax
measures.
japan
line
was
a
property
tax
case.
now,
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
this,
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
income
tax
case
here,
and
the
fact
that
property
was
used
and
held
to
be
included
in
adams
express
stocks
and
bonds,
the
court
said
they're
to
be
included
in
the
base,
stocks
and
bonds
in
connection
with
the
transportation
business
are
to
be
included
in
the
base
unless
it's
shown
that
they're
not
used
in
the
business.
we've
got
a
totally
different
kind
of
situation.
we've
got
an
income
tax
and
we've
shown
that
in
the
earning
of
this
income,
absolutely
nothing
takes
place
in
the
state
of
vermont.
so
there's
not
the
slightest
basis
for
their
taxing
us.
now,
i
do
want
to
press
another
point,
and
that
is,
there
really
is
an
important
difference
between
dividends
and
operating
income
for
purposes
of
how
the
states
divide
income.
the
history
of
apportionment
by
formula
is
this
take
the
typical
case.
you've
got
a
company
manufacturing
in
one
state,
manufactures
goods
in
one
state
and
sells
in
another.
we've
never
been
able
to
work
out
any
accounting
method
to
determine
how
does
the
net
income,
which
comes
final
step
on
the
sale
of
the
shoes
or
whatever
you
manufacture,
how
do
you
determine
what
the
legitimate
claim
of
each
of
those
states
that
are
part
of
this
integrated
operation,
how
do
you
divide
it
up
among
them?
the
accountants
failed
us.
and
so
we
developed
what
is
admittedly
a
rough
and
crude
approximation,
but
the
best
thing
we
know.
we
said,
"we'll
use
a
formulary
method
and
we'll
allow
certain
factors
to
determine
which
state
has
a
claim."
that
we
had
to
do.
but
dividends
were
traditionally
not
treated
under
the
formula.
why?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
sir?
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
at
this
point
i
have
associated
myself
with
the
scholars
and
tax
people
in
the
field
for
the
last
thirty
years.
it
has
developed
--
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
the
states
developed,
the
states
developed
and
all
of
them
use,
an
apportionment
method.
now
when
i'm
saying
"we,"
i
mean
the
community
of
fiscal
people
interested
in
this
area.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
the
formula.
it
was
a
formula,
your
honor.
the
point
i
am
making
is
this
why
did
we
go
to
the
formulary
method?
in
the
moorman
case,
what
did
you
have?
manufacture
of
animal
foods
in
illinois,
sale
in
iowa.
there's
no
way
you
can
determine
which
piece
of
income
without
a
formula,
whether
you
like
the
moorman
formula
or
not.
but
they
used
a
formula.
but
dividends
are
different,
and
the
reason
is
this.
typically
stocks
are
handled
at
the
executive
seat
of
the
corporation,
so
that
normally
it's
the
commercial
domicile
where
all
the
activities
take
place
earning
the
stock.
in
some
cases
it
may
be,
it
may
have
a
different
business
situs.
and
of
course,
we
have
made
the
contention
throughout
that
the
commercial
domicile
is
the
right
rule
unless
you've
obtained
a
business
situs
elsewhere.
now,
why
is
that
so?
you
don't
have
any
problem
of
localizing
the
source
of
the
income.
you
know
it.
it's
the
commercial
domicile
or
business
situs.
and
that's
why
traditionally
that
income
was
attributed
there,
and
that's
why
as
a
matter
of
fiscal
policy
it
should
be
attributed
there.
why?
by
any
precept
of
accepted
fiscal
policy,
benefits,
protection,
costs
of
services,
that's
the
state
that's
entitled
to
this
income.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
this
court
has
never
so
held.
state
courts
have
so
held,
lower
federal
courts
have
so
held.
we're
asking
this
court
so
to
hold,
because
it's
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
what
about
the
--
that's
a
very
interesting
question,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
your
honor,
the
only
cases
i
know
of
in
the
history
of
this
court
which
have
considered
that
question,
the
question,
i
take
it,
is
this
suppose
you
have
a
corporation
organized
in
delaware
and
it
has
the
usual
statutory
office
in
delaware
but
it
really
does
business
in
new
york,
and
new
york,
is
the
commercial
domicile.
under
this
commercial
domicile
rule,
does
that
deprive
the
state
of
delaware
of
the
power
to
impose
this
tax?
the
only
cases
i
know,
your
honor,
are
the
old
cream
of
wheat
case,
i
think,
in
the
capital
stock
tax
area
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
state
of
corporate
domicile,
because
it
incorporated
the
company,
might
not
be
deprived
of
its
power
to
include
all
the
intangibles,
all
the
assets
in
its
base.
subsequent
opinions
of
this
court
indicated
that's
open
to
doubt.
i
don't
know
how
the
court
would
decide
that.
the
court
could
take
one
of
two
lines.
the
court
could
determine
that
the
commercial
domicile
becoming
the
real
seat
of
the
corporation
in
a
substitute
for
the
powers
of
the
technical
corporate
domicile,
which
i
would
think
would
be
an
economically
and
realistic
rule,
or
conceivably
the
court
could
hold
that
both
would
have
the
power
to
tax
in
that
case.
but
that's
a
question
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
jerome
r.
hellerstein
your
honor,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
rule
of
law
that
doesn't
present
problems.
of
course
we're
going
to
have
problems.
but
these
are
manageable
problems,
sensible
problems,
and
not
what
you
get
into
with
the
diversity
of
apportionment.
of
course
there'll
be
problems.
but
it's
not
beyond
the
wit
of
the
tax
administrators
and
the
court
to
deal
with
them.
we
do
it
all
the
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
