mr.
hellerstein,
suppose
you
didn't
have
these
subsidiaries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
income
flowed
in
to
the
taxpayer,
mobil.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
be
here
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
part
of
your
argument
here
that
if
vermont
wants
to
take
in
these
dividend
income,
it
should
include
in
all
of
the
assets
owned
and
the
property
factor,
all
of
the
assets
owned
by
the
subsidiaries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can't
have
it
both
ways?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
new
york
could
tax
it
all
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hellerstein,
i
want
to
follow
up
on
a
suggestion
that
was
implicit
in
a
question
justice
blackmun
asked
you.
assume
there
were
no
subsidiaries
and
no
dividends,
and
with
respect
to
your
due
process
argument,
assume
that
you
had,
say,
a
division
that
engaged
in
entirely
separate
business
from
the
oil
company.
say
they
made
toys.
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
the
oil
business.
say
they
made
toys.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
sell
shoes
or
they
own
an
apartment
building,
derive
income
that
is
clearly
identifiable
with
a
particular
state
other
than
vermont.
in
your
submission,
could
vermont
include
that
income
as
a
matter
of
due
process
within
the
taxable
base?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hellerstein,
would
you
like
to
give
your
answer
into
the
microphone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
furthermore,
i
won't
hear
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
no
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
king,
may
i
just
ask
you
if
you
would
regard
as
equally
frivolous
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process,
the
state
would
be
required
to
exclude
the
toy
business
income,
if
they
had
a
separate
toy
business
in
a
different
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
that
was
frivolous,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he
correct
in
saying
that
it
is
customary
for
states
to
segregate
out,
to
permit
a
taxpayer
to
eliminate
income
from
entirely
separate
aspects
of
its
business
which
are
allocable
to
another
state,
and
clearly
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
realize
that,
but
he
said
typically
states
do
permit
that.
is
that
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
vermont
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
take
a
contrary
position
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dexter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
emphasizing
the
intangible
point
very
properly,
of
course,
because
that's
this
kind
of
case.
would
you
distinguish
my
hypothetical
case
of
a
toy
business
or
something
else
that
is
a
separate
operating
business
with
actual
tangible
assets,
but
identifiable
in
a
state
other
than
the
taxing
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
hypothesis
is
that
it's
not
unitary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that's
the
practice.
my
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
would
you
say
that
the
argument
that
that
is,
there
is
a
due
process
objection
to
taxing
that
out-of-state
income
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
draw
distinction
in
terms
of
constitutional
law.
i
know
what
the
practice
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
that
you've
answered
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is,
is
there
a
constitutional
--
you
say
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
to
treating
intangible
income
as
being
earned
in
vermont
because
you
can't
really
place
intangibles
and
it's
part
of
the
overall
business
always.
my
question
is
assuming
you
have
income
from
tangible
assets
which
is
clearly
identifiable
to
another
state
and
it's
not
in
the
unitary,
in
the
sense
we've
used
it
in
the
past,
part
of
the
unitary
business
operated
in
vermont.
is
there
a
valid
constitutional
objection
to
vermont
taxing
that
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
there
is
a
valid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
dexter,
how
do
you
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
that
if
you
want
to
throw
the
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it
make
a
lot
of
difference
in
a
case
like
this
if
the
value
of
the
shares
was
included
in
the
property
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
make
a
lot
of
difference
if
it
was
included
in
the
property
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
include
it
in
the
property
and
then
apportion
it.
you
just
include
it
in
the
factor
like
other
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
the
denominator
--
you
don't
know
where
99.9
percent
of
the
assets
are
in
vermont's
denominator,
do
you?
you
just
know
they're
not
in
vermont.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
all
you
need
to
know
is
the
total
figure
for
their
denominator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hellerstein,
what
about
including
in
the
denominator
the
value
of
the
shares
owned
in
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
don't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
over
ask
you
--
did
you
ever
ask
them
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hellerstein,
what
about
the
problem
of
the
corporate
domicile
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
delaware
and
a
commercial
domicile
in
new
york
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
each
tried
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
attach
100
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
valid
argument
as
to
whether
the
commercial
domicile
is
in
new
york
where
they
hold
their
directors'
meetings
and
have
some
safety
deposit
boxes,
or
over
in
new
jersey
where
they
have
their
principal
offices
day
to
day,
and
so
forth.
can't
you
have
a
problem
as
to
which
is
the
right
commercial
domicile?
