justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
will
take
up
number
1201
first.
this
is
mobil
oil
corporation
against
the
vermont
tax
commissioner.
the
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
vermont,
and
mobile
corporation
is
organized
under
new
york
law
and
it
has
its
principle
place
of
business
and
its
commercial
domicile
in
that
state.
it
does
business,
however,
in
many
other
states
including
vermont,
where
it
engages
in
the
wholesale
and
retail
marketing
of
petroleum
products.
vermont
imposed
a
corporate
income
tax
calculated
by
means
of
an
apportionment
formula
upon
foreign
source
dividend
income
received
by
mobil
from
its
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
that
do
business
abroad.
mobil
challenged
the
tax
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
commerce
clause.
the
state
tax,
however,
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
vermont.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
and
hold
that
the
vermont
tax
violates
neither
the
due
process
clause
nor
the
commerce
clause.
there
is
a
sufficient
nexus
in
our
opinion
between
vermont
and
the
appellant
to
justify
the
tax
and
neither
the
foreign
source
of
the
income
in
question
nor
the
fact
that
it
was
received
in
a
form
of
dividends
from
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
precludes
its
taxability.
the
appellant
failed
to
establish
that
the
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
engaged
in
activities
unrelated
to
its
sale
of
petroleum
products
in
vermont
and
thus,
it
has
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
that
its
foreign
source
dividends
are
exempt
as
a
matter
of
due
process
from
fairly
apportioned
income
taxation
by
vermont.
we
also
hold
the
tax
does
not
impose
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
by
virtue
of
its
effect
relative
to
mobil's
income
tax
liability
in
states
other
than
vermont.
assuming
that
new
york
has
the
authority
to
impose
some
tax
in
the
dividend
income,
there
is
no
reason
why
that
power
should
be
exclusive
when
the
dividends
as
here
reflect
income
from
the
unitary
business,
part
of
which
is
conducted
in
states
other
than
new
york,
nor
does
the
tax
impose
a
burden
on
foreign
commerce.
mobil's
argument
that
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
abroad
requires
allocation
of
foreign
source
income
to
a
single
domestic
site
as
we
conclude
is
without
merit.
i
am
authorized
to
state
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
