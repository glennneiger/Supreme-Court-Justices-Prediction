justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
large
a
tax
would
mobil
have
paid
in
vermont
under
your
theory
and
under
the
return
that
it
filed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
was
a
question,
rather
than
an
argument
that
i
was
making.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
those
dividends
taxed,
other
than
by
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
i
said
where
were
they
taxed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
were
they
taxed,
outside
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
another
question.
am
i
correct,
under
the
vermont
system
is
there
not
a
statutory
provision
that
enables
the
taxpayer
to
seek
a
reallocation
in
the
event
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
unfairness?
did
mobil
take
advantage
of
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
only
new
york
could
tax
these
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
only
new
york
could
tax
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
saying,
then,
that
only
new
york
can
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
doesn't
that
lead
to
the
same
sort
of
competitiveness
in
order
to
get
the
advantage
of
corporate
presence
and
activity
in
a
state,
like
delaware
used
to
have
in
corporate
charters,
that
the
state
with
the
lowest
income
tax
rate
for
investment
income
earned
out
of
the
country
is
going
to
be
a
haven
for
corporate
domiciles?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
this
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
following
up
justice
white's
question,
isn't
it
precisely
the
same
clause
of
the
constitution
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
and
with
the
indian
tribes
that
you
derive
your
argument
from?
so
if
it's
good
for
foreign
commerce,
it
must
be
good
for
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
mobil
ever
claim
that
if
you
wanted
to
include
the
dividends
you
must
include
the
underlying
assets
in
the
allocation
formula?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
this
is
an
integrated
business
worldwide,
but
yet
you
exclude
from
the
property
factor
the
property
that's
owned
by
the
subsidiary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
include
in
the
value,
in
the
property
factor,
the
total--
mobil's
total
property,
the
value
of
the
stock,
of
the
subsidiaries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
a
reason.
that's
just
a,
that's
just
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
vermont
treat
the
same
way,
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
would
indicate
yes,
that
income
from
mobil's
domestic
subsidiaries
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
mobil
has
chosen
to
report
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
about
separate
businesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
tax
imposed
in
japan
line
an
ad
valorem
property
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
an
income
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
japan
line
was
a
property
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
japan
line
was
a
property
tax
case
and
you
had
no
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"we,"
mr.
hellerstein
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"
we,"
are
you
talking
about
mobil
or
are
you
talking
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
court
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
moorman,
where
as
i
recall
iowa
used
only
one
factor
