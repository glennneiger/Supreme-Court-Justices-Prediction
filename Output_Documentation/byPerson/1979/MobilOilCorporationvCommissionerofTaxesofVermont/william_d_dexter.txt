mr.
william
d.
dexter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
certain
income
from
intangible
property,
namely
dividends,
can
be
included
in
a
state's
net
income
tax
base
subject
to
apportionment
when
the
taxpayer
has
made
no
showing
that
the
intangibles,
were
not
acquired
and
held
as
an
integral
part
of
its
unitary,
multi-state
business.
now,
mobil
would
lead
this
court
to
believe
that
there
is
some
constitutional
requirement
in
both
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
expressly
prohibits
states
in
which
that
business
is
conducted
from
including
such
income
in
apportionable
income
for
state
income
tax
purposes.
now,
mobil
initially
argues
that
the
state
in
which
a
multi-state
taxpayer
maintains
its
commercial
domicile
has
the
exclusive
power
to
subject
such
income
to
a
net
income
tax.
now,
no
decision
of
this
court
supports
such
an
arbitrary
rule.
in
fact,
all
of
the
apportionment
decisions
of
this
court,
net
worth
cases,
income
tax
cases,
ad
valorem,
utility,
property
tax
cases,
refute
this
idea.
now,
recognizing
the
weakness
of
the
commercial
domicile
fiction,
and
we
must
remember
it
is
a
legal
fiction.
mobil
has
changed
this
argument
to
include
the
states
of
either
the
commercial
domicile
or
business
situs
of
intangible
properties.
now,
let
us
examine
this
fictional
situs
theory
in
the
context
of
state
income
tax
laws.
first
we
must
realize
that
intangibles
by
their
very
nature
have
no
fixed
location
or
situs.
this
court
was
well
aware
of
that
in
many
domiciliary
cases
and
particularly
in
the
case
of
curry
v.
mccanless,
and
noted
that
the
bundle
of
benefits
and
interests
represented
by
intangible
properties
could
be
spread
over
many
jurisdictions
and
that
any
jurisdiction
had
the
power
to
tax
intangibles
if
those
jurisdictions
conferred
benefits
and
privileges
in
regard
to
the
ownership
of
such
intangibles.
but
in
the
case
of
stock,
where
is
it
located
for
state
income
tax
attribution
purposes?
this
is
the
underlying
question
in
this
case,
your
honors.
is
it
at
the
legal
domicile?
the
business
headquarters
or
commercial
domicile
of
the
corporation?
and
remember,
large
multinational
corporations
may
have
various
locations
that
could
qualify
as
the
commercial
domicile.
or
is
it
where
the
stock
certificates
are
physically
located?
is
the
situs
where
the
stock
would
be
pledged
or
hypothecated?
or
is
it
where
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
your
honor,
basically
the
position
of
the
states
is,
and
i
think
in
conforming
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
all
of
the
unitary
income
of
a
unitary
business
is
subject
to
a
reasonable
rule
of
apportionment.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
okay.
your
hypothesis
is
that
it's
not
unitary.
under
the
commission
regulations
you
would
treat
those
as
two
separate
distinct
trades
or
businesses
and
you
would
tax
them
accordingly.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
okay.
the
question
is
--
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case
--
the
bottom
line
is
the
apportionment
result.
what
income
has
the
state
attributed
to
it
by
the
application
of
an
apportionment
formula
to
a
tax
base?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
my
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
but
here
that
is
not
the
circumstance,
you
understand.
we're
talking
about
an
intangible
property
integrated
with
mobil
as
a
single
entity,
unitary
trade
or
business.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
combined
reporting.
we
are
saying
that
vermont
has
a
right
to
reasonably
apportion
that
path
of
mobil's
total
income
from
its
overall
operations
by
a
reasonable
attribution
rule.
and
that
mobil
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
an
apportionment
result
so
applied
is
violative
of
due
process,
because
it
taxes
extraterritorial
values
or
income
or
violates
the
commerce
clause
on
basically
the
same
ground.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
okay.
the
rationale
of
an
apportionment
formula
is
the
three-factor
formula
that
income
of
a
corporation,
regardless
of
what
is
the
nature
of
the
property
that
generates
this
income,
is
attributable
to
where
its
tangible
property,
payrolls,
and
sales
are
attributed.
now,
intangibles
by
their
very
nature
don't
have
a
fixed
situs.
so
that
conceptually
they
may
be
spread
over
the
business
wherever
it
is
conducted.
now,
that's
basically
what
this
court
did
in
the
adams
express
case.
$15
million
of
intangibles,
stocks
and
bonds,
$5
million
of
tangible
property,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
value
of
this
tangible
property,
going
concern
value,
in
the
taxing
state.
and
this
court
said
it
was
an
apportionment
of
the
entire
intangible
value
on
the
basis
of
the
physical
location
of
the
underlying
property.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
do
this
because
of
the
elusive
nature
of
intangible.
and
really
what
mobil
and
cost
and
nam
are
saying
here,
because
of
that
elusive
nature,
they
can
know
that
it
represents
a
tax
exemption
to
apply
legal
fictions,
or
elusive
concepts
like
business
situs.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
value
of
the
shares?
wasn't
included
in
the
property
factor?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
but
the
question
is,
if
you
include
it
in
the
property
factor,
if
you're
going
to
include
intangibles,
what
state
you
attribute
it
to.
for
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
but
you
have,
your
honors,
each
factor
you
have
to
give
it,
you
have
to
locate
it
for
purposes
of
the
numerator
of
the
apportionment
factor.
where
do
you
put
it
in
the
numerator?
in
new
york,
the
commercial
domicile,
where
the
business
situs
of
the
property
is,
or
do
you
spread
it
basically
by
ignoring
it
where
the
underlying
tangible
property
is?
and
essentially,
that
is
what
is
done,
except
when
someone
comes
in
and
asks
for
some
kind
of
relief.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
denominator
would
be
total
property,
tangible
property,
or
tangible
property
within
the
state.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
simply
because
the
three-factor
formula
is
limited
to
tangible
property
with
the
idea
that
in
that
intangibles
have
not
fixed
cites
for
the
nominator
purposes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
where
do
you
attribute,
the
commercial
domicile,
the
legal
domicile
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
it's
total
tangible
property.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
mean,
that's
the
way
the
factors
work.
now,
i
mean
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
am
saying,
because
you
don't
know
where
to
put
it
in
the
denominator.
if
it's
used
basically
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
no,
no.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
no,
no,
the
numerator
over
the
denominator
equals
the
fraction.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
we
do
not
say
that
it's
not
located
in
vermont.
we
say
that
it
has
a
business
situs
where
vermont,
where
mobil
carries
on
its
underlying
business
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
oh,
it
would
make
a
substantial
difference.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
i
doubt
it.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well.
