mr.
richard
johnston
king
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
vermont
imposes
an
annual
net
income
tax
on
all
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state.
that
tax
is
measured
by
that
share
of
a
corporation's
federal
taxable
income
which
is
apportioned
to
vermont
by
a
standard
three-factor
formula.
professor
hellerstein
suggests
that
the
tax
system
adopted
by
the
vermont
legislature
necessarily
produced
the
result
that
they
seek.
i
suggest
it
did
not.
they
arrived
at
that
result
by
clearly
violating
the
terms
of
the
vermont
statute
and
not
using
as
apportionable
net
income
their
federal
taxable
income,
but
rather
using
as
apportionable
net
income
federal
taxable
income
from
which
they
had
excluded
all
income
received
in
the
form
of
dividends.
as
mr.
hellerstein
suggests,
mobil
is
a
fully
integrated
petroleum
company
conducting
business
in
part
in
vermont
and
in
part
in
other
states
of
the
nation.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
constitution
required
vermont
to
exclude
dividend
income
from
apportionable
net
income.
in
view
of
mobil's
substantial
business
activities
in
vermont,
i
suggest
that
the
due
process
inquiry
is
frivolous.
mobil
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
dividends
in
question
were
not
related
to
its
integrated
petroleum
business,
and
therefore
were
not
properly
includable
in
apportionable
net
income.
professor
hellerstein
mentions
that
they
did
seek
modification
of
the
formula.
that
is
correct.
the
commissioner
denied
modification
and
that
issue
has
not
been
appealed
to
this
court
and
the
modification
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
i
would
say
that
was
a
frivolous
question.
what
professor
hellerstein
proposes
there
in
his
answer
to
that
question
is
separate
accounting.
separate
accounting
is
an
alternative
to
apportionment,
but
the
two
are
not
used
in
conjunction
with
each
other.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
that
depends
on
the
state
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
the
vermont
statute
would
include
in
the
apportionable
net
income
all
federal
taxable
income
of
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
take
a
contrary
position.
however,
your
honor,
the
vermont
statute
contains
a
clear
provision
that
if
the
apportionment
factors
apply
to
all
of
a
taxpayer's
federal
taxable
income
do
not
produce
a
result
which
fairly
reflects
the
extent
of
business
activities
within
the
state,
then
the
commissioner
is
directed
to
modify.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
mobil
has
admitted
that
the
income,
or
stockholdings
in
its
subsidiaries
and
affiliates,
are
part
of
its
integrated
worldwide
petroleum
business.
whether
or
not
on
different
facts
modification
would
be
appropriate,
i
can't
tell
you.
however,
it
would
depend
on
the
showing
before
the
commissioner,
much
as
the
question
of
multiple
taxation
depends
on
the
showing
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
perhaps
they
claimed
it.
but
that,
your
honor,
is
confusing
two,
entirely
separate
systems
of
taxation.
vermont
imposes
--
mr.
richard
johnston
king
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
that,
your
honor.
we
are
taxing
only
the
income
of
mobil
oil
company,
corporation.
we
are
not
taxing
the
income
of
mobil's
operating
subsidiaries
and
affiliates,
and
there
is
a
big
difference
between
income
and
dividends.
there
is
no
necessary
or
direct
relationship
between
dividends
paid
and
property,
business
activity,
or
profits.
may
i
suggest
that
point
is
well
illustrated
on
the
record.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
almost
no
state
includes
the
value
of
intangibles.
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
any
state
includes
the
value
of
intangibles.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
may
i
answer
that
question,
sir?
mr.
richard
johnston
king
your
honor,
that
situation
can't
come
up.
well,
excuse
me,
that
could
come
up.
it
would
also
be
included.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
it
would
be
included,
yes.
the
answer
to
the
question
of
why
there
is
no
property
factor
for
the
intangible
stock
is
twofold.
one,
this
is
a
tax
on
net
income,
not
a
tax
on
the
property
which
produces
that
income.
i
think
that's
a
critical
distinction.
the
second
point
is
that
historically,
and
--
mr.
richard
johnston
king
the
second
point
is
that
historically,
and
conceptually,
intangibles,
particularly
when
they
are
held
by
a
corporate
multi-state
business,
are
attributed
to
those
states
in
which
that
corporation
does
business
in
the
same
percentages
as
the
apportionment
factors
of
those
states.
and
mathematically
if
you
exclude
the
intangible
property
entirely,
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
apportionment
factors,
because
it's
excluded
equally
in
all
of
the
states,
according
to
their
apportionment
factors.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
correct.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
income
from
domestic
subsidiaries,
your
honor,
would
be
consolidated
under
the
federal
system.
there
would
be
no
dividends.
it's
a
full
dividend
deduction.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
no,
because
we
tax
based
on
federal
taxable
income
and
in
federal
taxable
income,
intercorporate
dividends
from
subsidiaries
are
subtracted,
or
deducted,
excuse
me.
one
hundred
percent.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
if
it
was
a
separate
business,
if
mobil
was
holding
stock
in
dupont,
then
no,
then
it
would
be
included.
but
your
honor,
the
point
raised
on
income
from
intangibles,
the
same
point
can
be
made
with
regard
to
patents,
royalties.
professor
hellerstein
has
conceded
that
that
is
apportionable
income.
the
same
point
can
be
made
with
many
other
property,
tangible
or
intangible.
the
income
is
included
and
is
apportionable.
mobil
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
these
stockholdings
were
not
connected
with
its
integrated
petroleum
business.
mobil
has
not
met
this
burden.
in
fact,
the
only
proof
that
mobil
has
offered
in
response
to
this
burden
are
the
statements
that
the
stock
certificates
are
held,
managed,
and
controlled,
and
the
dividends
are
received
outside
vermont.
this
brings
up
another
interesting
question,
and
that's
professor
hellerstein's
commercial
domicile
point.
i
suggest
that
that
question,
that
issue,
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
commercial
domicile
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
mobil's
stockholdings,
with
the
stocks
themselves,
or
with
the
dividends
received.
mobil
has
shifted
position
somewhat
in
its
reply
brief
to
say
well,
it's
either
commercial
domicile
or
business
situs.
there
is
no
business
situs
which
has
been
identified
on
the
record.
that
leaves
a
taxpayer
with
this
kind
of
a
record
in
a
position
to
go
to
each
state
in
succession
and
say,
"they're
not
here,
can't
tax
them."
so
i
would
suggest
that
the
commercial
domicile
argument
is
entirely
speculative
on
this
record.
as
to
the
fact
that
mobil's
properties
are
held,
that
mobil's
stockholdings
are
held,
managed,
and
controlled
outside
the
state
of
vermont,
so
are
many
of
mobil's
other
properties,
and
the
income
from
all
of
those
properties
is
clearly
includable
in
apportionable
net
income.
the
whole
concept
of
apportionment
is
to
get
away
from
precisely
what
mobil
is
trying
to
get
us
into
here,
and
that
is
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
where
in
an
integrated
operation
profits
arise,
and
to
what
particular
location
those
profits
are
attributable.
that
simply
is
not
a
workable
system,
as
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
long
ago,
and
certainly
as
any
scholar
in
the
field
has
recognized.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which,
or
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
would
support
or
imply
a
prohibition
against
apportioning
among
the
states
income
from
intangible
property
used
in
an
integrated
business
activity,
a
part
of
which
was
conducted
within
the
state.
i
made
a
point
on
dividends
a
little
earlier
in
connection
with
a
question
from
mr.
justice
white.
at
page
a90
of
the
consolidated
appendix
there
appears
a
graphic
illustration
of
what
i
said.
in
paragraph
31
there,
they
report
a
dividend
paid
by
a
company
which,
and
i
quote,
"had
no
gross
income
during
the
year
1970,
the
only
year
here
at
issue
in
which
it
paid
dividends
to
mobil."
what's
the
relationship
between
the
dividends
and
the
underlying
factors?
none
whatsoever.
mobil
next
argues
that
because
its
operating
subsidiaries
and
affiliations
are
engaged
in
foreign
commerce,
that
there
is
a
prohibition
against
mobil
including
the
dividends
paid
on
those
stocks.
once
again,
a
failure
to
focus
on
what
the
subject
of
the
tax
is.
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
the
net
income,
and
in
a
very
old
case,
page
v.
lull,
this
court
very
clearly
focused
on
that
distinction
and
said
the
net
income
is
not
the
foreign
commerce
which
produced
that
income.
i
think
that
is
a
conceptual
point
that's
exceedingly
elementary
and
basic
to
this
issue.
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
would
determine
the
tax
consequences
of
income
in
the
hands
of
a
taxpayer
on
the
basis
of
the
tax
attributes
of
the
payor
of
that
income.
in
this
case,
mobil
is
receiving
the
income
from
its
operating
subsidiaries
and
affiliates,
much
as
it
would
receive
income
from
the
sale
of
petroleum
products,
much
as
it
would
receive
royalties
from
the
licensing
of
patents.
nothing
supports
a
tax
analysis
based
on
the
characteristics
or
the
business
or
the
property
factors
of
the
payor.
the
court'
s
decision
in
japan
line,
i
suggest,
therefore
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
this
case.
as
to
mobil's
multiple
taxation
argument,
i
believe
the
court
clearly
said
in
moorman
that
multiple
taxation
must
be
proved
to
have
in
fact
occurred.
i
would
also
suggest
that
in
the
context
of
a
tax
on
apportioned
net
income,
the
multiple
taxation
concept
doesn't
make
any
sense,
because
when
you
mix
taxes,
for
example
these
types
of
tax
mobil
argues
for
in
its
commercial
domicile
argument,
is
a
gross
receipts
tax.
it
says
that
all
dividends
--
mr.
richard
johnston
king
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
johnston
king
absolutely.
and
the
problem
of
multiple
taxation
that
was
raised
in
japan
line
was
simply
this.
a
foreign
sovereign
had
taxed
property.
the
county
of
los
angeles
sought
to
impose
another
tax
on
that
property.
double
taxation
in
fact
appeared
on
the
record,
and
the
court,
in
i
think
a
very
sound
rationale,
said,
"look.
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
control
the
apportionment
between
a
foreign
sovereign
and
a
united
states
political
subdivision."
that's
basic.
here
the
foreign
commerce
multiple
taxation
argument
that
mobil
makes
is
that
there
is
a
risk
that
the
states
will
impose
multiple
taxation.
that's
a
risk
over
which
this
court
clearly
has
a
controlling
power.
this
court,
as
it
has
said
in
several
opinions,
will
correct
errors
of
apportionment
when
they
occur.
mobil's
speculative
argument
that
multiple
taxation
could
result
from
diverse
state
formulae
goes
right
to
that
point.
when
it
does,
the
court
clearly
is
authorized
to
make
a
corrective,
or
require
corrective
measure.
neither
the
constitution
nor
any
decision
of
this
court
grants
to
the
commercial
domicile
of
a
multi-state
business
the
power
to
tax
without
apportionment
income
from
intangibles
held
in
connection
with
that
business.
if
that
issue
was
ever
properly
raised,
i
suggest
that
this
court
might
require
apportionment
which
would
fairly
allocate
to
those
states
in
which
business
is
conducted
a
share
of
that
income.
that
case
has
not
been
raised
on
this
record.
that
is,
i
think,
exceedingly
important.
vermont
is
a
state
in
which
mobil
conducts
substantial
business
activities,
taxed
mobil's
net
income
including
dividends
from
operating
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
fairly
apportioned
to
local
business
activities.
mobil
has
conceded
that
the
apportionment
factors
were
correctly
calculated
and
the
apportionment
formula
was
correctly
applied.
on
the
record,
the
tax
imposed
was
nondiscriminatory,
fairly
apportioned
to
reflect
mobil's
substantial
business
activities
in
vermont,
and
fairly
related
to
the
services
provided
by
vermont.
mobil
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
proving
that
its
stockholdings
in
operating
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
were
unconnected
with
its
integrated
petroleum
business,
a
part
of
which
was
carried
on
in
vermont.
in
fact,
mobil
has
basically
conceded
that
point.
mobil
has
also
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
proving
that
its
dividends
could
be
subjected
to
multiple
taxation
if
included
in
the
vermont
tax
base.
accordingly,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
moorman,
or
most
recently
the
moorman
decision,
the
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
should
be
upheld.
thank
you.
