are
there
no
local
northern
california
beers
anymore?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
pabst
was
originally
a
wisconsin
company.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
effect
this
--
if
that's
all
seniority,
means
all
you
would
need
to
do
is
have
a
(voice
overlap)
one
or
two
sentence
definition
of
it,
the
number
of
days
you
worked
for
the
plant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
--
you're
saying
that
seniority
is
as
simple
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was,
then
all
you
would
need
in
defining
a
seniority
system
is
a
one
or
two
sentenced
paragraph.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
go
off
on
summary
judgment
or
was
it
after
trials?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
granted
by
the
breweries
were
granted
in
that
--
those
judgment
or
were
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
of
someone
who
has
worked
five
years
on
an
assembly
line
and
someone
who's
worked
25
years
on
an
assembly
line
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
a
litmus
paper
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
this
--
our
case
wasn't
on
summary
judgment
or
a
motion
to
dismiss,
how
can
the
ninth
circuit
have
any
peculiar
knowledge
as
to
what
was
“behind”
the
agreement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
collectively
bargained
for
by
the
union,
could
--
presumably
has
the
employee
in
mind.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
a
complaint
that
temporaries
may
have
against
the
union
rather
than
that
the
possible
permanent
employee
has
against
the
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
the
extent
that
it
makes
it
more
expensive
for
the
employer
to
keep
on
employees
who
worked
for
a
number
of
years
and
the
employer
has
a
finite
amount
of
money
that
he
can
devote
to
labor
cost.
it
necessarily
makes
it
cheaper
for
the
employer
as
with
respect
to
new
--
new
employees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
any
bona
fide
seniority
system
is
necessarily
going
to
be
top
heavy
with
labor
cost
at
the
--
at
--
at
the
upper
end
of
the
age
scale
of
the
workers
and
if
the
--
if
it's
a
finite
of
amount
of
wages
of
--
of
money
available
to
the
employer,
it's
going
to
be
conversely
lower
in
the
lower
wage
scales.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
a
--
as
a
rule
where
45
weeks
out
of
52
does
not
count
as
seniority
or
if
it's
a
44,
does
not
advance
one
toward
seniority,
is
a
seasonal
industry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
--
did
the
ninth
circuit
send
this
back
for
trial
or
did
it
simply
say,
“this
is
not
a
seniority
system.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
--
if
you
--
if
you're
right
and
you
have
to
kind
of
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
thing
just
behind
it,
i
would
think
that
was
a
factual
issue
if
there
ever
was
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
was
collective
bargaining
in
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
of
a
good
deal
of
that
patience
ended
with
the
landrum-griffin
act
of
1959
where
the
congress
finally
got
into
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
to
a
certain
extent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
develop
a
record
except
by
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
record
of
--
of
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
business
justification
is
meant,
wouldn't
it
be
also
a
business
justification
for
that
kind
of
a
seniority
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
then
that
you
--
the
plaintiff
can
pick
and
choose
as
among
the
seniority
provisions
and
say
some
are
protected
by
703
(h)
and
some
aren't.
