mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
number
of
facts
in
this
record,
some
of
which
have
been
touched
on
by
mr.
carr
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
it
cannot
be
disputed
and
that
are
r
and
r
few
determinative
of
this
case.
one
of
these
facts
is
that
the
45-week
rule
is
based
on
time
served,
it
is
based
on
service.in
determining
whether
that
rule
reflects
the
seniority
principle,
therefore,
it
becomes
necessary
to
determine
to
find
out
under
the
system
how
in
a
--
a
temporary
employee's
chances
of
working
45
weeks
in
a
calendar
year
are
allocated.
as
mr.
carr
has
indicated,
the
competition
for
work
opportunities
among
temporary
employees
is
determined
by
plant
and
industry
seniority
that
accrues
from
year
to
year.
it
is
this
accrual
interaction
of
seniority
that
affords
the
employee
the
opportunity
to
work
45
weeks
in
a
calendar
year,
and
therefore,
satisfied
the
requirement.
so
viewed
against
the
context
of
the
total
seniority
system,
it
seems
the
time
that
the
45-week
rule
in
the
acquisition
of
permanent
status
reflects
seniority
principles
to
the
fullest
possible
degree.
one
of
the
functions
of
the
45-week
rule
is
to
regulate
competition
between
so-called
permanent
employees
and
temporary
employees.
it
is
the
way,
in
other
words,
that
industry
service
is
given
partial
seniority
credit
at
the
plant.
whereas
the
government
says
at
page
24
of
its
brief,
“it
is
a
measure
of
time
worked.”
and
like
other
measures
of
seniority,
the
45-week
rule
is
to
a
great
extent
determinative
of
where
an
employee
appears
on
the
seniority
list.
and
mr.
bryant
has
always
agreed
that
the
brewery
system
should
extend
recognition
to
length
of
industry
service.
that
appears
at
page
306
and
307
of
the
record.
but
neither
he
nor
the
government
likes
the
45-week
rule
because
it
does
not
give
controlling
effect
to
what
they
describe
as
cumulative
length
of
service.
we
submit
that
in
seeking
to
restrict
section
703
(h)
to
cumulative
length
of
service
systems,
our
opponents
apparently
confuse
simple
longevity
with
seniority.
longevity
is
only
one
of
the
values
that
are
reflected
in
seniority
arrangements.
if
it
were
the
only
value,
if
it
were
the
only
value,
all
seniority
systems
would
allocate
opportunities
across
the
broadest
possible
basis.
there
would
be
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
establishing
separate
units
of
seniority
as
appeared
in
the
system
considered
by
this
court
in
teamsters.
there
would
be
no
agreements
having
rules
providing
for
the
breaks
in
seniority
or
for
loss
of
accrued
seniority
altogether
as
can
be
found
in
virtually
every
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the
question.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
simply
a
--
a
sentence
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
saying
that
plant
seniority
shall
govern
for
all
purposes.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
seniority
clause,
it
would
not
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
is
one
other
factor
that
would
have
to
be
here
other
than
the
measure
of
seniority.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
there
would
have
to
be
a
definition
of
the
field
of
eligible
participants.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
otherwise,
you
(voice
overlap)
wouldn't
also
compete
using
their
plant
seniority.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
but
the
--
the
point
that
i
--
that
i
wish
to
make
and
i
--
i
think
it
is
an
important
one
that
the
qualifications
on
absolute
accumulation
of
seniority
exist
today.
they
existed
in
1964
when
title
vii
was
passed
and
they
existed
from
the
beginning
of
seniority
arrangements
in
the
1880s
in
the
railroad
industry.
congress
in
1964,
acted
to
protect
--
vested
seniority
rights.
those
rights
that
had
accrued
under
seniority
systems
if
whatever
form
and
description,
we
think
it
plain
that
congress
did
not
seek
to
restrict
section
703
(h)
its
protections
to
so-called
accumulative
length
of
service
systems
if
indeed
such
systems
exist.
that's
all.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
--
let
me
start
first
by
reviewing
--
referring
to
one
or
two
factual
matters.
i
am
advised
that
afl
plant
never
had
been
covered
by
the
agreement
in
issue
that
the
industry
seniority
provisions
would
not
be
applicable
to
that
agreement.
also,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
maximum
amount
of
vacation
a
senior
employee
in
the
industry
can
obtain
is
six
weeks
per
year.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
six
weeks
per
year.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
yes.
yes,
it
would
be.
it
would
be
normally
through
the
accrual
of
an
industry
vacation
by
cumulating
time
worked
at
different
plants.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
if
he
--
if
he
took
the
vacation
or
if
he
qualified
for
it,
you
don't
--
you
earn
your
vacation
on
the
basis
of
time
worked
according
to
a
particular
formula.
you
--
you
don't
get
six
weeks
automatically.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
i
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
--
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
would
suspect
not.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
allegation
that
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
is
to
create
a
--
a
pool
of
cheap
labor,
the
temporary
employees
earn
vacations
too.
in
fact,
mr.
bryant
earned
a
vacation
by
working
45
weeks
in
two
calendar
years
at
falstaff.
the
point
is
that
the
benefits
under
the
agreement,
very
expensive
benefits,
pension,
health
and
welfare
are
held
by
temporary
employees.
this
is
not
a
depressed
pool
of
labor.
now,
building
on
that
theme,
i
should
like
to
suggest
that
the
analysis
suggested
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
urged
by
the
government
and
the
respondent
here
will
affect
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
their
arguments
go
not
so
much
to
the
classifications
but
they
go
to
the
appropriateness
of
this
seniority
system.
under
the
guise
of
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
a
seniority
system,
they
are
questioning
the
appropriateness.
let
me
refer
to
at
least
some
of
the
adjectives
that
i
heard
them
use
just
before
this
court.
it
is
harsh,
it
is
unfair,
it's
unjustified,
we
can't
see
the
business
necessity,
it's
unnecessary.
people
don't
like
it.
it
sets
up
divisiveness
between
permanent
and
temporary
employees
in
the
union.
these
are
questions
that
go
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
choice
that
was
made
by
management
and
labor.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
the
government
proposes
a
cumulative
length
of
service
criterion
which
is
a
criterion
that
henceforth,
it's
been
unknown
in
the
real
world
of
collective
bargaining.
they
proposed
absolute
cumulative
length
of
service.
any
provision,
that
does
not
measure
up
but
of
course
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
that's
correct.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
if
this
court
holds
that
this
particular
provision
is
a
seniority
system
within
the
meaning
of
section
703
(h).
there
will
be
opened,
your
honor,
in
gap.
this
title
vii
protection
will
be
inevitably
wounded.
i
can't
see
how
this
will
happen,
but
the
ninth
circuit
and
what
the
government
are
concerned
about
is
privileging
classification
devices,
privileging
test,
education
requirements
and
other
obvious
non-seniority
criteria.
these
are
the
--
these
are
the
override
factors
that
all
parties,
the
employers,
the
unions,
and
the
af
of
l
have
indicated,
would
not
be
covered
by
section
703
(h)
its
protection.
the
45-week
rule
is
a
measure
of
time
worked.
it
deals
with
service
and
because
it
is
itself
based
on
service,
there
is
no
possibility
whatever
that
there
could
be
any
confusion
between
an
obvious
seniority
provision
like
this
rule
and
the
classification
devices
that
the
--
our
opponents
has
so
artfully
enmeshed
in
this
case.
one
quick
word
if
i
might
on
the
need
to
construe
703
(h)
narrowly.
this
is
a
theme
that's
runs
through
all
the
briefs.
we
suggest
that
analytically,
it
is
ill-funded.
section
703
(h)
with
a
definitional
provision
caught
in
the
act
by
congress
to
determine
what
actions
were
discriminatory
and
unlawful
and
what
were
not.
it
was
designed
to
confirm
congress'
understanding
stated
many
times
in
the
legislative
history
that
bona
fide
seniority
systems
were
not
intended
to
be
condemned
by
the
general
prohibition
of
title
vii.
it
is
not
an
exemption
to
title
vii's
remedial
purpose.
indeed
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
it
--
it
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
i
--
i
will
answer
the
question.
i
do
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
that
that
was
how
the
ninth
circuit
got
in
trouble
below.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
but
with
that
--
but
with
that
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
because
it
is
based
on
time
worked.
it
is
a
criterion
of
advancement
based
on
actual
service
as
opposed
to
some
other
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
let's
call
it
a
non-seniority
criterion.
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
yes,
i
am
glad
i
don't
have
that
case.
i
have
a
case
in
which
that
it
once
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
--
in
a
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
--
as
professor
slichter
said,
there
is
a
positive
danger
in
--
mr.
roland
p.
wilder,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
make
it
a
--
an
easier
case
analytically.
and
that
is
all
the
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case.
thank
you.
