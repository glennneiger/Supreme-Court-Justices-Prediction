--
may
it
please
the
court.
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
requirement
that
there'd
be
45
weeks
of
work
within
a
calendar
year
in
order
to
achieve
the
status
of
a
permanent
employee,
the
california
brewing
industry,
whether
this
is
a
seniority
system
or
a
part
of
a
seniority
system.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
it
was
an
all
or
nothing
proposition
and
that
didn't
--
did
not
meet
the
fundamental
test
with
seniority
system
which
they
said
had
to
be
based
upon
length
of
service.
it
is
our
position
that
from
an
examination
of
the
system
itself,
it
not
only
looks
like
a
seniority
system,
it
operates
as
a
seniority
system,
and
it
is
a
seniority
system.
california
brewing
industry,
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed,
operated
under
a
multiemployer
agreement.
there
are
a
number
of
unions
involved
under
this
agreement
too.
within
the
particular
classification
of
brewer
which
is
the
classification
of
mr.
bryant,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
held,
there
were
three
tiers
of
employees.
there
were
new
employees,
there
were
temporary
employees,
and
there
were
permanent
employees.
a
new
employee
was
an
employee
who
work
60
days
within
a
calendar
year
in
order
to
become
a
temporary
employee.
a
temporary
employee
was
an
employee
who
worked
within
45
weeks
within
a
calendar
year
in
order
to
become
a
permanent
employee.
throughout
the
time,
from
the
day
that
the
employee
first
comes
to
the
industry
and
starts
working
in
the
industry,
starts
acquiring
seniority.
he
acquires
seniority
on
two
different
bases.
he
acquires
seniority
on
the
plant
basis
and
he
also
inquires
seniority
on
an
industry
basis.
this
seniority
has
different
applications
for
different
purposes.
but
for
each
day
that
the
employee
work,
he
is
building
up
seniority
credit
towards
various
purposes
under
the
agreement.
for
example,
after
the
employee
has
worked
30
days,
he
is
no
longer
a
probationary
employee.
after
he's
worked
30
days,
he
cannot
be
discharged
except
for
just
cause.
after
he
has
worked
60
days
within
a
calendar
year,
then
he
becomes
a
temporary
employee.
now,
when
he's
a
new
employee
as
he's
working
along
this
way,
he
is
building
up
plant
seniority
as
a
new
employee.
he's
also
building
up
industry
seniority
as
a
new
employee.
among
other
new
employees,
he
has
seniority
rights
within
the
plant.
he
would
be
laid
off
after
other
--
after
other
new
employees
were
laid
off
who
were
junior
to
him.
and
within
the
industry,
he
would
have
also
rights
as
a
new
employee.
when
he
becomes
a
temporary
employee,
he
then
has
further
rights
as
a
temporary
employee
on
the
basis
of
his
work
within
the
particular
plant
and
also
as
a
temporary
employee
based
upon
his
work
within
the
industry.
if
a
temporary
employee
is
going
to
be
laid
off,
he
is
going
to
be
laid
off
based
upon
his
seniority.
the
junior
temporary
employee
working
in
that
plant
would
be
the
first
person
laid
off.
the
senior
temporary
employee
will
be
the
last
laid
off.
if
an
employee
is
going
to
be
recalled
to
work
within
that
plant
and
they
have
a
need
for
temporary
employees,
then
the
temporary
employee
with
the
greatest
seniority
within
that
plant
will
be
the
first
to
be
recalled
and
the
temporary
employee
with
the
least
seniority
within
that
plant
will
be
the
last
recalled.
the
same
situation
pertains
to
permanent
employees.
within
the
classification
of
permanent
employees,
it
is
the
permanent
brewers
that
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
within
the
classification
of
permanent
employees,
employees
are
laid
off
according
to
their
seniority
as
permanent
employees.
the
most
senior
permanent
employee
is
laid
off
last,
the
most
junior
employee
--
permanent
employee
is
laid
off
first.
on
a
question
of
recall,
and
this
is
again
on
the
basis
of
plant
seniority,
the
permanent
employee
with
the
greatest
seniority
would
be
recalled
first
and
the
plant
employee
or
the
permanent
employee
with
the
least
seniority
would
be
the
--
recalled
last.
this
is
the
way
it
works
on
a
plant
by
plant
basis.
in
addition
to
this,
our
industry
applications
of
the
seniority
principle
--
for
example,
the
temporary
employee
and
i
might
pause
here
for
a
second
to
point
out
that
the
term
“temporary
employee”
maybe
a
misnomer.
it's
a
term
that
is
used
in
the
contract.
these
are
not
temporary
employees
in
the
sense
that
they're
casual
employees,
these
and
temporary
employees
maybe
employees
who
have
worked
for
a
period
of
years
within
the
industry
and
have
acquired
important
and
significant
rights.
the
temporary
employee
on
the
basis
of
this
industry
service,
he
may
work
for
one
company,
for
two
companies,
for
three
companies,
will
acquire
rights
and
will
work
--
work
towards
acquiring
the
45
weeks
of
work
within
the
calendar
year
which
will
enable
him
to
become
a
permanent
employee.this
is
an
application
of
industry
seniority.
also,
there's
another
application
of
industry
seniority
as
far
as
temporary
employees
are
concerned.if
a
temporary
employee
is
out
of
work,
he's
been
laid
off
by
his
own
employer
and
all
the
temporary
employees
with
plant
seniority
at
another
plant
have
been
recalled
and
they
still
need
for
additional
temporary
employees
of
that
plant,
the
plant
employee
or
the
temporary
employee
with
the
greatest
industry
seniority
will
be
the
first
person
recalled
to
that
plant.
so
this
is
another
application
of
the
seniority
principle
working
within
the
system.
and
the
employees
also
are
acquiring
in
other
rights
in
addition
to
the
competitive
rights
of
seniority
which
i
mentioned.
they're
also
acquiring
benefit
rights.
they're
acquiring
rights
as
far
as
health
and
wealth
are
concerned.
they're
acquiring
rights
as
far
as
pensions
are
concerned.
they're
acquiring
rights
as
far
as
vacations
are
concerned.
these
rights
are
building
up
within
this
multitiered
system
as
the
employees
progress
through
the
system.
now,
when
the
system
comes
to
the
point
where
the
employee
is
working,
say
less
than
45
weeks,
the
temporary
employee
is
working
less
than
45
weeks
within
the
calendar
year,
and
so
therefore,
he
does
not
become
a
permanent
employee.
the
ninth
circuit
suggested
or
claimed
that
this
was
an
all
or
nothing
proposition,
and
that
he
had
to
start
over
again
on
january
1
of
the
following
year
and
earn
the
45
weeks
of
work
within
that
year.
in
our
opinion,
this
was
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
examine
the
system
as
a
whole
as
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions,
seniority
systems
are
quite
varied
in
their
application
in
the
varieties
that
they
have
and
that
there's
no
one
system
is
--
note
41
in
teamsters
says,
“no
one
system
is
to
be
preferred.”
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
well,
in
our
opinion,
your
honor,
they
said
it
was
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
in
other
words,
a
person
had
to
start
over
again
the
following
year
and
then
so
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
it
is
incorrect,
your
honor
in
this
respect,
in
our
opinion.
he
does
not
lose
his
seniority.
he
has
a
seniority
that
he's
accumulated
as
a
temporary
employee.
if
he
has
worked
40
weeks
within
1979
as
a
temporary
employee,
he
does
not
lose
that
seniority
on
january
1,
1980.
he
maintains
that
seniority
and
that
will
give
him
the
first
opportunity
to
be
referred
out
to
a
--
the
company
that
--
from
which
he
was
laid
off
assuming
it
was
a
light
layoff
at
the
time
and
he
will
be
the
last
person
laid
off
based
upon
that
seniority,
that
plant
seniority
that
he
has
acquired
is
not
lost
even
though
he
does
not
attain
permanent
status
within
the
year.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
he
has
to
earn
45
weeks
within
the
calendar
year
but
he
does
not
start
over
again
in
the
sense
that
his
seniority
is
continuing
to
push
him
ahead.
his
seniority,
his
plant
seniority,
his
industry
seniority
is
going
to
give
him
the
best
opportunity
to
work
the
45
weeks
of
work
in
1980
to
become
a
permanent
employee.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
that's
conceivable,
your
honor.
but
that
i
think
it's
very
unlikely
hypothetical.
this
case
is
before
this
court
without
any
evidence
as
to
the
operation,
the
maintenance
of
the
system
or
how
it
actually
operates,
is
conceivable
under
the
language
of
the
agreement
that
this
can
work.
however,
i
think
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
an
employee
would
find
himself
in
that
position.
there's
only
two
reasons
that
an
employee,
under
the
situation
that
you
posit
could
be
a
disadvantage
to
that
extent.
and
that
would
be,
number
one,
if
he
is
working
for
a
company
which
has
economic
problems,
economic
downturns,
and
so
therefore
they
are
laying
off
employees
and
they're
not
the
job
opportunities
at
that
plant,
that's
one
fortuity.
the
other
fortuity
would
be
if
the
employee
himself
was
not
available,
if
he
was
on
leave
of
absence,
if
he
was
sick,
if
he
was
injured.
but
each
day
that
an
employee
works
under
the
system
within
the
industry
and
within
the
plant,
he
is
acquiring
seniority
rights
which,
with
reasonable
certainty,
will
assure
him
of
the
best
opportunity,
the
best
chance
of
becoming
a
permanent
employee
the
following
year.
in
northern
california,
the
brewing
industry
as
according
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
record.
however,
as
we
indicated
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
even
there
are
allegations
that
no
blacks
have
made
permanent
employee
within
the
industry
during
the
period
of
time
involved
in
the
complaint.
if
this
case
is
remanded
by
this
court,
we
are
prepared
to
show
that
there
were
some
777
employees
who
became
permanent
employees
from
the
temporary
ranks
and
that
all
that
members,
some
33%
were
minorities.
and
we
are
prepared
to
show
that
if
this
case
is
remanded
by
this
court.
most
of
these
employees,
all
but
28
of
these
employees
became
permanent
employees
in
southern
california
out
of
777,
this
is
in
a
ten-year
period
from
1968
to
1978.
and
all
the
28
of
them
became
permanent
employees
in
southern
california.
this
is
where
the
companies
were
operating
and
that
were
the
most
successful.
this
is
where
anheuser-busch,
miller,
and
schlitz
were
operating.
they
were
the
most
successful.
they
are
the
only
three
companies
left
at
the
present
time.
mr.
bryant
on
the
other
hand
happened
to
be
working
in
northern
california.
at
the
present
time,
all
those
breweries
are
gone.
in
fact,
they
were
declining
at
the
time
that
he
was
working
in
the
industry.
for
example,
he
was
working
at
falstaff
in
san
jose.
he
then
transferred,
when
falstaff
moved
to
san
francisco
to
take
over
a
hams
plant
which
had
closed,
he
transferred
up
there.
at
the
present
time
and
this
is
indicated
in
a
footnote
in
our
opening
brief.
there
are
no
northern
california
breweries.
one
of
the
things
which
i
should
also
point
out
on
the
seniority
principle
here
is
that
as
mr.
bryant
had
chosen
to
and
if
he
could
have
seen
what
was
going
to
happen
in
northern
california
with
the
various
companies
closing
down
and
no
longer
operating
because
of
business
adversities,
he
could
have
sought
transfer
to
southern
california
and
registered
for
work
in
the
southern
california
area
and
then
referred
out
as
a
temporary
employee
to
one
of
the
southern
california
breweries.
and
then
he
might
at
that
point
of
time
because
they
were
in
expanding
mode
and
there
was
a
--
a
number
of
opportunity
--
job
opportunities,
he
might
have
been
one
of
the
fortunate
ones,
presumably,
he
would
have
been
based
upon
the
seniority
principles
that
i've
alluded
to
who
would
have
made
permanent,
one
of
the
777
employees
who
have
made
permanent
within
the
last
10
years.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
there
are
no
northern
california
breweries
operating
at
the
present
time
and
all
the
companies
that
were
operating
under
the
california
brewers
association
contract
have
now
closed
down
including
falstaff
hams,
general
brewing
corporation,
and
burger
meister
was
another
one
that
was
operating
at
one
point.
there
are
only
three
companies
operating
in
california
at
the
present
time
which
are
schlitz,
millers,
and
anheuser-busch.
pabst
closed
down,
which
was
a
southern
california
company
earlier
this
year,
which
is
also
the
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
pabst
was
a
--
yes,
and
anheuser-busch
was
originally
in
st.
louis
but
these
are
companies
that
were
operating
in
california.
and
pabst
no
longer
has
a
plant
in
california.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
that
maybe
true,
your
honor.
i
haven't
seen
a
statistics
on
that.
that
might
be
something
that
would
come
to
the
court's
attention
on
remand.
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
in
any
event,
where
the
arguments
of
the
supreme
--
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
particular
case
was
that
this
system
is
subject
to
manipulation.
in
our
opinion,
it
is
not
subject
to
manipulation
because
it
is
a
seniority
system.
it
is
the
major
of
time
worked.
an
employee
advances
within
the
system
from
temporary
to
permanent
status
based
upon
the
time
that
he
works.
his
layoff
and
recalls
from
layoff
are
based
upon
the
time
that
he
works.
this
is
an
objective
standard.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
this
is
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
not
--
the
time
--
the
--
his
layoff
is
not
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
time
he
worked
in
one
year,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
yes.
but
then
naturally,
the
time
that
he
has
worked
before
that
particular
year
will
push
him
up
to
the
front
of
the
ranks
of
those
people
who
will
be
--
have
it
--
or
receive
the
first
opportunities
for
the
allocation
of
the
available
work
in
the
year
in
question.
his
seniority
is
not
lost.
his
seniority
continues
and
he
will
be
the
first
recalled
and
he
will
be
the
last
laid
off
based
upon
his
seniority
as
a
temporary
employee.
so
then,
he
will
then
become
a
permanent
employee
that
much
more
certainly
based
upon
the
service
that
he's
already
accumulated
as
a
temporary
employee.
this
is
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
common.
there's
also
some
other
cases
that
had
been
cited
in
the
brief
and
in
the
afl-cio
brief,
they
included
in
their
appendix
a
example
in
the
seafarers
union
where
this
type
of
a
program
exist.
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
new
jersey
brewing
company
involved
a
situation
where
employees
had
to
work
on
a
similar
basis.
gerber
foods
involved
a
situation
where
the
war
labor
board
directed
that
the
provision
be
that
there'd
be
600
hours
within
a
six-month
period
which
is
quite
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
so
there
is
a
considerable
precedent
for
this
type
of
system
in
this
operation
of
a
system
along
this
line.
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
a
case
decided
a
few
years
ago
when
he
was
a
judge
in
outland,
that
very
short
term
is
length
of
service
being
considered
the
dominant
factor
and
that
is
contrary
to
experience
and
also
to
judicial
attitudes
to
say
that
it
is
a
dominant
factor.
in
this
case,
we
do
have
a
major
of
time
work
and
whether
it'd
be
within
a
discrete
period
of
time
as
in
45
weeks
within
a
calendar
year,
it
is
still
a
period
of
time
work.
it
is
not
running
to
any
of
devises
that
might
be
considered
in
other
types
of
cases
if
you're
dealing
with
the
supervisor's
evaluation
or
an
educational
test
or
something
like
that.
this
is
an
objective
seniority
standard.
it
is
a
major
of
time
work
and
it
operates
just
on
that
basis.
our
position
as
far
as
the
disposition
of
this
case,
the
disposition
that
this
court
should
make
this
case
is
first,
that
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
mr.
bryant
to
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
any
allegations
of
intentional
or
differential
treatment
that
he
maybe
able
to
establish.
secondly,
if
there's
some
question
in
the
court's
mind
or
in
the
party's
mind
as
to
whether
this
is
a
bona
fide
system
which
was
specifically
not
addressed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
then
it
should
be
remanded
to
have
a
determination
made
and
evidence
taken.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
this
case
is
before
you
without
a
record
as
to
the
actual
operation
or
without
any
evidence
as
to
whether
there's
any
question
of
the
bona
fides
of
this
particular
case
--
particular
provision.
finally,
we
think
that
this
court
can
and
should
decide
that
this
particular
provision
based
upon
an
examination
of
the
totality
of
the
seniority
system
within
the
california
brewing
system,
how
it
works
on
a
plant
basis,
how
it
works
on
an
individual
company
basis
that
it
must
be
held
to
be
a
seniority
system
and
therefore
within
exemption,
703
(h)
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
if
there's
a
--
if
there's
any
question
raised
and
it
has
not
been
decided,
yes,
it
should
be
remanded
to
determine
if
it's
bona
fide.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
and
that
can
--
and
that
could
be
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
and
under
the
principles
of
franks
v.
bowman
--
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
--
the
court
can
grant
relief
if
they
find
differential
treatment
without
disturbing
the
seniority
system.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
i
might
not,
your
honor.
it's
been
around
for
25
years
and
it's
worked
satisfactory
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned
for
over
the
last
25
years.
in
addition,
you
may
also
notice
that
there's
another
category
of
employees
within
the
agreement.
that's
the
permanent
bottler
and
the
temporary
bottler.
you
progress
from
a
temporary
bottler
to
a
permanent
bottler
based
upon
1600
hours
of
work,
and
that
is
of
course,
gives
credit
for
overtime
work
that
you
may
perform.
and
that
was
a
change
from
an
earlier
provision
where
they
required
45
weeks
of
work
within
the
calendar
year,
they
changed
it
to
1600.
it
maybe
that
through
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
where
we
think
it
belongs
rather
than
before
this
court,
through
the
process
of
collective
bargaining,
there
may
be
a
change
in
the
way
that
the
contract
reads
and
--
and
how
you
move
from
temporary
to
permanent
but
we
believe
it's
up
to
the
parties
rather
than
to
the
courts.
mr.
willard
z.
carr,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
is
--
we
--
in
our
opinion
within
a
specific
exemption
granted
by
congress
in
section
703
(h),
and
that
to
give
congress
its
due
that
this
should
be
held
to
be
exempt
from
the
reach
of
title
vii
otherwise,
your
honor.
