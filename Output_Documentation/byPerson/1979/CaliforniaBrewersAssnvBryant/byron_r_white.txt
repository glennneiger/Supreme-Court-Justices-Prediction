justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
is
not
a
seniority
system,
it's
going
to
be
quite
a
swath
cut
through
collective
bargaining
agreements,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
phrase
the
position
of
the
afl-cio
in
term
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they'd
--
they'd
say
this
is
a
seniority
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
this
is
--
in
any
event,
this
is
a
seniority
system
in
their
--
in
their
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
i
wouldn't
be
so
interested
if
this
was
on
the
effect,
maybe
one
or
two
strays
--
stray
collective
bargaining
agreements,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
somebody
besides
permanent
employees
belong
to
these
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
someone
besides
permanent
employees
belong
to
these
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
--
your
argument
about
whether
this
is
a
seniority
system
or
not
would
be
the
same
whether
there
was
any
racial
--
racial
aspects
of
this
case
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
not
just
to
--
it
won't
be
disgrace
or
be
any
kind
of
what
could
be
called
invidious
discrimination.
that
would
be
--
that
could
be
gotten
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
this
the
ninth
circuit
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
think
that
if
--
if
the
employer
and
the
union
had
a
contract
and
--
and
they
agreed
that
one
classification
of
employees
was
permanent
employees,
then
at
--
in
this
company,
we
--
they
had
agreed
there
would
be
a
hundred
employees
of
permanent
employees.
and
that
as
--
as
--
and
a
permanent
employee
retired,
he'd
be
replaced
and
he'd
be
replaced
by
the
fellow
who
had
worked
the
longest
time
in
the
last
two
years.
now,
i
take
it
that
you'd
have
the
same
problem
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
should
be
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
what
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
it's
just
between
two
years
and
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
in
this
case,
the
question
of
seniority
has
been
finally
disposed
off
by
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
no
longer
an
issue
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
government
who
says
more
than
that.
the
government
says
--
proposes
two
criteria
to
--
by
which
to
judge
whether
something
is
seniority
system
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
isn't
triggered
by
that.
any
advantage
that
isn't
triggered
by
cumulative
in
the
services,
not
part
of
a
seniority
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
--
could
i
ask
you
if
there
was
--
what
if
--
what
if
the
only
semblance
of
a
seniority
system
in
this
case
was
a
collective
bargaining
provision
providing
for
how
people
enter
the
permanent
employee
class?
that's
all,
that's
the
--
and
there's
nothing.
you
don't
accumulate
any
other
kind
of
time
by
being
a
temporary
employee.
there
are
no
advantages
whatsoever
from
--
from
length
of
service
except
if
you
work
45
weeks
in
any
year
or
whatever
the
week
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you're
a
permanent
employee.
that's
the
only
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
a
seniority
system
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it
was
wrong
even
on
its
--
even
on
its
simplistic
assumptions,
it
was
wrong?
