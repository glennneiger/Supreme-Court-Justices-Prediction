justice
potter
stewart
but
then
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
court
accepts
your
argument,
how
--
what
action
should
we
take
in
this
case,
to
remand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
see
if
a
--
first
of
all,
it
was
bona
fide?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
also
for
a
consideration
of
the
plaintiff's
title
vii
claims
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
know
--
know
--
knowing
that
this
is
a
seniority
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
issues
would
be
if
it's
bona
fide
and
secondly,
even
if
it
is
bona
fide,
it
was
a
discrimination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
quite
apart
from
this
seniority
system.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
would
still
have
to
be
--
well,
suppose
defined
in
terms
of
interruptions
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
there
are
--
all
has
to
be
all
sorts
of
ground
rules
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
obviously
didn't
work
for
seven
years
in
the
common
meaning
of
that
term.he
--
he
worked
for
the
parts
of
seven
years.
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
don't
know
what
his
income
was,
i
mean
it
--
it
could've
been
--
even
if
he'd
worked
a
week
in
one
year.
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
work
for
seven
years.
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
since
this
was
decided
rather
summarily
as
it
was,
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
--
in
the
record
to
show
the
history
of
the
collective
bargaining
of
this
particular
provision,
is
there?
no,
your
honor.
and
of
course
we
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
--
one
can
assume
that
it
followed
the
pattern
that
you're
describing
of
give
and
take.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be
a
permanent
employee,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
glad
you
don't
have
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
only
simplified
the
case
to
be
just
that.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
makes
unlawful
any
practices,
procedures
or
tests
that
operate
to
freeze
the
status
quo
of
prior
discriminatory
employment
practices.
but
to
this
general
rule,
section
703
(h)
of
the
act
provides
an
exception.
that
section
makes
clear
that
the
routine
application
of
a
bond
fide
seniority
system
is
not
unlawful
under
title
7
even
where
the
employer's
pre-act
discrimination
has
resulted
in
white
people
having
greater
existing
seniority
rights
than
negroes.
the
present
case
concerns
the
application
of
section
703
(h)
to
a
particular
clause
in
a
california
brewery
industry
collective
bargaining-agreement.
that
agreement
accords
greater
benefits
to
permanent
employees
than
it
does
to
temporary
employees
and
the
clause
in
question
provides
that
a
temporary
employee
must
work
at
least
45
weeks
in
a
single
calendar
year
before
he
can
become
a
permanent
employee.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
this
45-week
requirement
was
not
a
seniority
system
or
part
of
a
seniority
system
within
the
meaning
of
section
703
(h).
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
