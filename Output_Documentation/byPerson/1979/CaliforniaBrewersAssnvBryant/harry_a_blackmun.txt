mr.
carr
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
you
don't
--
will
you
point
out
where
in
the
ninth
circuit
statement
was
incorrect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
--
is
that
incorrect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
meant
it
was
lost
in
that
respect.
but
to
become
a
permanent
employee,
he
has
to
start
over
again,
doesn't
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
not
true
that
if
one
man
who
worked
on
a
year
and
a
half
but
happened
to
work
45
weeks
in
one
calendar
year,
is
a
permanent
employee.
whereas
someone
who
has
worked
35
years,
44
hours
a
week
still
was
a
temporary
employee
and
junior
to
the
other
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
how
many
get
across
the
line
between
“temporary”
and
you
admit
this
is
a
poor
term,
into
the
permanent
category?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
they
drink
more
beer
in
the
southern
california
than
in
northern.[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
based
on
the
time
he
worked
in
one
year.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
but
you
--
you
said
he
advanced
from
temporary
to
permanent
based
on
the
time
he
worked.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
they
amended
that
to
say
on
the
time
he
worked
in
one
year.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
carr,
i
suppose
there
isn't
any
possibility
of
the
unions
and
management
working
out
something
different.
this
is
an
old
type
of
thing.
surely
as
a
lawyer,
in
the
face
of
703
(h),
you
wouldn't
be
drafting
this
kind
of
a
system
today.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
suppose
the
--
the
argument
is
that
is
a
collective
bargaining
and
that's
the
barrier.
and
it
--
it's
not
too
dissimilar
from
the
case
we
had
this
morning.
