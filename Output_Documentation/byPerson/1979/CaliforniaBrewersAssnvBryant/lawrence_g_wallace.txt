mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
united
states
views
the
governing
legal
principles
in
this
case,
the
broader
propositions
urged
by
the
employers
and
the
unions
here
proved
too
much.
seniority
in
the
sense
of
length
of
service
is
ordinarily
a
substantial
ingredient
in
transfers,
promotions,
layoffs,
rehirings
and
in
measuring
compensation
and
fringe
benefits.
this
cannot
mean,
we
submit,
that
all
additional
criteria
considered
along
with
seniority
for
such
purposes
thereby
become
part
of
the
seniority
system
within
the
meaning
of
section
703
(h)
and
thereby
become
immunized
from
examination
under
the
ordinary
standards
of
title
vii.
otherwise,
the
limited
purpose
exception
of
703
(h)
would
largely
swallow
up
title
vii's
guarantee
of
non-discrimination
in
transfers,
promotions,
layoffs,
rehiring,
and
in
compensation
and
fringed
benefits.
so
our
major
premise
in
this
case
is
that
a
rule
such
as
the
45-week
rule
that
at
issue
here,
must
be
separately
scrutinized
for
purposes
of
section
703
(h)
to
determine
whether
it
embodies
the
seniority
principle.
another
way
of
stating
the
same
proposition
is
that
we
don't
believe
the
use
of
the
word
system
in
section
703
(h)
is
meant
to
be
a
grab
bag
for
non-seniority
considerations
that
can
be
tied
in
with
seniority
considerations
and
thereby
immunized
from
the
basic
non-discrimination
principle
of
title
vii.
if
anything,
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
more
plausible
to
read
the
word
system
in
703
(h)
as
indicating
the
way
in
which
seniority
can
be
used
to
override
the
non-discrimination
principle.
it's
only
systematic
use
rather
than
ad
hoc
use
of
seniority
which
is
being
authorized
to
override
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
non-discrimination
principle
so
that
there
will
be
a
guarantee
that
to
the
extent
seniority
will
override
the
basic
principle
of
the
statute,
it
will
be
systematic
seniority
available
to
all
classes
of
persons
rather
than
ad
hoc
use
of
seniority
that
might
prejudice
the
protected
classes.
now,
our
minor
premise
in
this
case,
it
seems
that
that's
fundamentally
important
question
before
the
court.
our
minor
premise
is
that
the
45-week
rule
at
issue
here
does
not
embody
the
seniority
principle
as
we
understand
it
because
it
does
not
provide
reasonable
certainty
of
progression
based
principally
on
cumulative
length
of
satisfactory
and
reasonably
continuous
service.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
rule
is
invalid
but
only
in
our
submission
that
it
is
not
immunized
by
section
703
(h)
from
a
challenge
under
title
vii.
and
the
legal
standard
i
have
stated
is
a
rather
complex
one
involving
cumulative
length
of
satisfactory
and
reasonably
continuous
service
and
reasonable
certainty
of
progression.
it
--
and
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
think
they
were
that
specific,
mr.
justice.
although
they
said
nothing
inconsistent
with
this
as
i
read
their
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
the
complexities
of
seniority
rules
largely
go
to
determining
these
various
elements
that
i'm
stating
rather
than
to
incorporating
in
other
considerations
and
other
values
that
don't
go
to
effectuating
the
basic
principle
of
seniority
which
is
what
congress
meant
to
protect.
and
their
discussion
was
largely
in
terms
of
last
hired,
first
fired
kind
of
relatively
simple
considerations.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
the
approach
to
703
(h)
that
is
faithful
to
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
which
was
to
assure
that
there
would
be
a
non-discrimination
principle
applicable
to
work
rules
affecting
all
these
valuable
rights
in
the
employment
relationship.
and
our
view
of
what
constitutes
seniority
for
these
purposes
is
supported
as
well
by
this
court's
decisions
by
analogy,
considering
what
constitutes
seniority
for
purposes
of
veterans'
reemployment
rights
under
the
military
selective
service
act.[laughs]
as
we
explain
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
on
pages
8
and
9
and
in
footnote
7,
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
this
45-week
rule
does
not
meet
the
legal
standard
for
purposes
of
703
(h)
is
because
of
the
fortuities
that
it
permits
to
displace
cumulative
length
of
service
as
determinative
of
achieving
the
permanent
status
that's
involved
here.
but
even
if,
in
our
view,
even
if
it
produce
results
that
more
closely
approximated
cumulative
length
of
service,
it
still
seems
to
us
would
not
be
a
rule
that's
part
of
a
seniority
system
because
of
the
lack
of
reasonable
certainty
of
progression
which
was
the
basic
reason
why
in
the
mccarthy
case,
cited
and
discussing
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
a
veteran
was
not
entitled
to
a
promotion
that
he
could
not
be
reasonably
certain
of
having
received
during
the
period
of
his
military
service.
that
after
all
is
an
act
in
which
seniority
of
being
an
emulative
principle
should
be
broadly
interpreted
where
here,
it's
an
exception
that
should
be
narrowly
interpreted.
instead,
what
we
have
is
a
classification
system
which
--
as
mr.
wolpman
has
explained,
has
something
about
us
and
them
syndrome
in
which
there
is
no
reasonably
certain
progression
from
the
class
of
them
to
the
class
of
us
that
can
be
earned
through
stages
of
seniority,
through
which
there
is
some
kind
of
systematic
progression.
now,
it
maybe
that
in
this
industry,
these
classifications
are
justified
by
the
business
needs
of
the
particular
industry.
and
we
don't
say
that
in
determining
whether
the
business
justification
has
been
met
under
title
vii,
there
is
no
room
for
flexibility
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
--
the
--
the
seniority
aspects
of
this
contract
don't
need
a
justification
in
our
view,
mr.
justice,
but
because
they're
protected
by
703
(h)
and
some
of
those
were
recited
by
mr.
carr.
but
the
45-week
rule
for
the
reasons
i
have
just
stated
is
not
part
of
this
seniority
provisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
the
question
presupposes
that
the
45-week
rule
is
a
seniority
provision
but
i
have
devoted
my
entire
argument
to
the
reasons
why
we
think
it
is
not
a
seniority
provision.
so
i
--
i
can
only
say
that
it's
not
a
matter
of
picking
and
choosing
the
seniority
provisions,
are
protected
by
703
(h)
but
this
is
not
a
seniority
system
both
because
it's
not
based
principally
on
cumulative
length
of
service
and
--
and
because
there's
no
reasonable
certainty
of
progression
from
one
class
to
another
here.
but
we
do
believe
that
there
is
a
needing
of
the
business
necessity
test
considerable
room
for
flexibility
in
the
bargaining
process
for
reasonable
accommodations
to
meet
the
substantial
needs
of
the
industry.
but
the
inquiry
still
must
be
as
a
justification
of
these
classifications
whether
this
does
meet
a
substantial
need
of
the
industry.
there
--
there
is
room
for
flexibility
in
determining
how
to
meet
the
substantial
needs.
but
the
question,
if
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discriminatory
impact
is
made,
would
be
whether
a
classification
system
of
this
type
is
necessary
to
meet
substantial
needs
in
this
industry.
all
of
this
has
not
been
explored
although
some
justifications
have
been
recited
in
the
briefs
but
it
since
it's
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
might
--
there
might
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
--
it's
very
similar
although
there
would
be
some
additional
certainty
of
progression
in
your
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
hypothetical
mr.
justice,
because
here
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
here,
the
indications
are
that
automation
is
reducing
the
number
of
permanent
employees
and
that
people
are
not
progressing
into
that
rank
but
this
is
something
that
has
not
been
explored
in
detail.
it
is
an
allegation.
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals,
although
i
--
i
can't
say
what
it
has
based
on,
stated
that
no
one
in
northern
california
is
advancing
from
one
class
to
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
mr.
justice.
that
based
on
their
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
what
is
of
principle
concern
to
us
are
the
governing
legal
principles
which
i
have
come
to
--
to
state.
