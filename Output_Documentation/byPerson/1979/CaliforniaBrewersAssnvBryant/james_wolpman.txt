mr.
james
wolpman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
add
to
the
facts
shortly
anyway.first
of
all,
there
is
still
a
brewery
in
northern
california,
anheuser-busch
operates
a
very
large
brewery
in
fairfield.
during
much
of
the
time
that
this
dispute
was
going
on,
there
were
likewise
other
breweries
in
northern
california
where
mr.
bryant
could
have
worked.
mr.
bryant
seems
to
fall
into
the
category
of
an
inconceivable
situation
as
mr.
carr
has
phrased
it,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
worked
for
seven
years
in
the
northern
california
brewery
industry
and
never
was
able
to
pass
the
barrier
into
permanent
employment.
mr.
james
wolpman
right.
a
major
part
--
his
major
source
of
income
during
that
period
was
--
mr.
james
wolpman
right.
that's
--
it's
in
the
--
it
--
there
is
in
the
record,
there
are
some
interrogatories,
indicated
the
periods
of
time
that
he
worked
during
those
years
and
it
was
his
major
life
endeavor.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
wolpman
it
was
even
before
summary
judgments
on
motions
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
defendant
breweries,
your
honor.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
correct.
the
--
there
are
two
other
important
facts.
one
is
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
actual
day
to
day
work
carried
on
by
a
permanent
brewer
and
by
a
temporary
brewer.
yet
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
pay
and
benefits
which
accrued
to
those
two
categories.
in
our
brief,
we've
indicated
with
citations
to
appropriate
parts
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
no
less
than
16
areas
where
the
permanent
brewer
is
advantaged
over
the
temporary.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
that
extreme.
this
is
certainly
an
extreme
situation.
i
want
to
point
that
out
because
the
ninth
circuit
took
that,
i
think,
into
account
in
sort
of
a
litmus
paper
test
if
you
want
as
to
whether
this
was
a
seniority
provision.
mr.
james
wolpman
well,
any
--
there's
so
many
differences.
the
--
the
system
operates
so
harshly
on
the
temporary
as
compared
to
other
people
down
the
seniority
lines
and
other
kinds
of
operations.
and
the
cutoff,
this
all
or
nothing
thing,
is
so
unique
that
i
think
that
--
that
that
possibility
led
the
court
to
go
on
from
that
and
--
and
begin
to
analyze
what
was
behind
that
possibility
as
revealing
that
what
was
really
going
on
here
was
something
other
than
seniority
considerations,
and
i'll
try
to
--
i
have
to
--
i'll
try
to
draw
that
out
a
little
more
in
my
argument,
your
honor,
as
we
proceed.
mr.
james
wolpman
the
agreement
itself
will
tell
us
a
lot,
your
honor.
it
will
tell
us
that
there's
a
tremendous
financial
advantage
to
the
employer
if
he
utilizes
temporaries
who
do
the
same
work
as
permanents,
that
that's
the
purpose
for
this
provision.it's
not
a
seniority
provision.
mr.
james
wolpman
right.
and
the
union
did
have
some
employees
in
mind.
that's
the
other
part
of
the
purpose.the
old
time
employees,
it
definitely
were
taken
into
account.
mr.
james
wolpman
in
fact,
the
fine
--
essential
a
finite
wage
and
benefit
package
has
been
divided
up
by
those
few
permanents
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
temporaries.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
think
it
raises
really
--
no,
the
question
that
is
the
--
is
this
really
a
seniority
a
provision
or
is
it
a
thing
that
allows
the
employer
low-paid
labor
and
the
old
timers
the
right
to
--
to
divide
up
a
--
a
package
among
themselves,
a
--
a
smaller
number.
now,
that's
--
that's
--
that
may
--
there's
--
i'm
not
saying
those
reasons
are
necessarily
illegitimate
or
illegal.
i'm
saying
those
are
not
the
reasons
that
lie
at
the
--
at
the
root
of
the
seniority
principle
to
see
--
the
root
of
the
seniority
principle
is
to
reward
the
accumulation
of
service,
to
reward
the
person
as
he
works
for
years
and
years.
not
to
--
on
what
it
does
for
the
employers
making
--
make
it
cheaper
or
for
the
unions
allow
a
few
people
to
share
all
of
the
benefits.
mr.
james
wolpman
it
certainly
does,
your
honor
but
that's
not
seniority.
that's
--
that's
our
point.
that's
something
else.
and
that's
something
that
would
have
to
be
justified
as
a
business
necessity.
remember,
we're
not
saying
that
the
45-week
provision
is
automatically
invalid.
we're
saying
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court,
we
will
have
to
establish
that,
and
indeed
does
perpetuate
the
discrimination
of
the
past
and
the
employer
will
have
the
opportunity
to
--
to
establish
that.
indeed,
he
has
to
have
it
that
way
because
it's
a
business
necessity.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
--
i
think
we
have
to
get
--
to
--
to
get
at
the
--
to
the
answer
to
that
question,
you
have
to
begin
to
see
what
kind
of
industry
we're
talking
about
here,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
you
have
to
see
that
we
are
talking
about
a
seasonal
industry.
and
a
seasonal
industry,
what
is
unique
about
a
seasonal
industry
is
that
it
is
tied
to
the
calendar
year.
it's
--
it's
a
calendar
year
notion.
and
the
biggest
thing
about
jobs
in
that
senior
--
in
that
kind
of
industry
is
whether
or
not
you
are
a
year
rounder
or
whether
you're
just
a
seasonal.
that's
--
that's
ingrained
in
the
job
structure
of
a
seasonal
industry.
and
what
the
45-week
provision
is
about
--
is
about,
is
about
the
classification
structures
that
exist
in
seasonal
industries,
it's
not
about
seniority.
seniority
comes
into
play
in
the
first
half
of
the
--
there
--
the
sentence,
45
weeks
in
a
calendar
year.
45
weeks
as
the
government
indicates,
is
a
seniority
measure
in
a
calendar
year,
is
something
that
comes
from
somewhere
else
that
comes
from
the
principles
that
i've
indicated
to
you,
the
advantages
that
accrued
to
the
employer
and
to
the
old
time
union
members
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
seniority.
so
you
put
those
two
together
and
you
get
the
45-week
rule.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
the
typic
--
the
--
the
typical
way
that
you'll
find
in
packing
industry,
for
example,
you'll
find
this
--
the
same
kinds
of
structure
which
are
being
attacked
to.
they
have
to
do
with
the
job
structuring
of
the
industry,
not
with
seniority.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
don't
know
off
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor.
i
suspect
that
it's
--
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
right.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
right.
it
--
mr.
james
wolpman
possibly.
it
--
it
can
get
very
difficult
--
mr.
james
wolpman
--
to
pass
--
mr.
james
wolpman
it's
a
--
it's
a
very,
very
difficult
hurdle.
and
it's
a
hurdle
that
--
again,
and
the
ninth
circuit
observed,
that's
the
hurdle
that
you
have
to
be
very
mistrustful
of
because
in
any
large
industry,
there
is
enough
free
play
in
the
scheduling
of
the
startup
of
production
and
in
the
timing
of
layoffs
to
very
easily
allow
an
employer
the
economies
that
come
with
maintaining
a
large
low-paid
labor
pool.
i
think
that
the
--
the
best
way
i
can
portray
the
--
the
--
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
here
is
to
put
it
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining.
in
collective
bargaining,
the
--
the
union
comes
in
with
proposals
and
the
management
comes
in
with
other
--
with
counterproposal
that
seek
to
limit
or
to
alter
the
proposals.
that's
--
that's
exactly
the
way
it
is
with
seniority.
unions
will
generally
propose
seniority
provisions.
management
will
answer
with
countervailing
limitations
on
the
seniority
provision,
limitations
such
as
testing,
ability,
supervisor's
recommendations
or
whatnot.
those
are
non-seniority
principles.
and
--
and
what
you
may
come
up
with
is
some
kind
of
compromise
between
those
two.
mr.
james
wolpman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
given
that
give
and
take,
i
think
that
--
and
this
--
and
this
is
the
real
danger
of
the
position
that
the
employers
are
taking
--
taking.
given
that
give
and
take,
what
they
want
to
say
is
that
any
system
that
combines
those
two
elements,
the
seniority
principle
plus
the
conflicting
countervailing
considerations
which
--
which
have
been
interjected
in
the
course
of
bargaining
by
the
employer
that
that
entire
system
is
protected.
in
other
words,
you
have
not
only
the
seniority
principle
but
you
have
the
concerns
that
are
coming
from
the
opposite
direction.
now,
i
think
that
that
--
and
now
--
and
that's
why
they
say
a
mixed
system
is
protected
so
that
--
such
that,
well,
they'll
--
they're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
a
test
for
example
as
a
--
as
a
grounds
for
promotion
would
be
invalid.
they
would
claim
703
(h)
protection
for
a
test
combined
with
a
--
a
seniority
provision.
now,
besides
these
countervailing
non-seniority
considerations
that
do
come
from
management,
there
are
again
seniority
principle
and
the
aspects
of
it
has
to
be
worked
out.
there
has
to
be
rules
for
how
seniority
is
obtained
in
a
unit.
there
has
to
be
rules
for
loss
of
seniority.
there
has
to
be
rules
for
breaks
in
service.
these
rules
have
to
do
with
the
elaboration
of
the
seniority
principle.
they
are
a
part
of
seniority.
they
do
not
concern
the
countervailing
considerations
that
the
employers
generally
have
introduced
to
erode
the
notion
of
seniority.
they
could
be
said
to
compliment
or
elaborate
rather
than
override,
supersede
or
restrict.
so
the
real
issue
here
becomes,
is
the
45-week
provision
in
a
calendar
year,
one
of
these
housekeeping
ground
rules
or
is
it
something
that
is
coming
from
another
direction
from
the
countervailing
limitations
on
seniority.
and
that
is
as
i
think,
requires
an
analysis
of
the
purpose
behind
the
45
weeks
in
a
calendar
year.
so
i
think
that
ultimately,
you
have
to
get
at
the
purpose
behind
this.
and
this
is
nothing
new.
the
court
has
--
has
done
this
in
the
veterans
cases,
in
accardi
and
in
alabama
power.
it
didn't
take
what
management
and
laborer
agreed
to
as
seniority
or
non-seniority,
in
those
cases,
it
faced
value.
it
says
we
have
to
look
at
it.
we
have
to
enter
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
wolpman
it
--
well,
it
--
it
sent
it
back
for
trial
but
it
also
said
that
this
is
not
a
seniority
system,
therefore,
we
would
go
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
perpetu
--
whether
it
indeed
does
perpetuate
discrimination
and
whether
it
can
be
justified
as
a
business
necessity.
it
eliminated
703
(h).
mr.
james
wolpman
i
--
i
would
say
that
except
that
the
facts
are
so
completely
clear
in
the
collect
--
from
the
nature
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
obvious
--
obvious
economic
advantage
which
accrues
to
the
employer
by
maintaining
a
few
permanents
and
as
many
temporaries
as
possible.
the
obvious
advantage
which
has
been
pointed
out
by
--
like
professor
slichter
in
his
book
which
is
cited
in
all
the
briefs
as
to
the
old
timers
getting
what
they
want.
now,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
old
timers
getting
what
they
want.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
employer
trying
to
save
money,
but
that's
not
seniority.
that's
not
what
section
703
(h)
was
about.
mr.
james
wolpman
it
certainly
was
collective
bargaining
but
not
everything
as
we
well
know
from
the
history
of
title
vii
litigation
is
in
collective
bargaining
is
to
be
protected.
well,
i
think
there's
a
real
danger
that
if
we
took
this
mixed
notion
of
seniority,
that
is
the
rules
for
working
out
seniority
and
the
seniority
principle
and
this
countervailing
considerations
that
the
--
that
the
expansion
in
that
would
occur
in
703
(h)
would
--
would
wind
its
way
into
just
about
every
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we've
pointed
out
16
areas
in
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
the
seniority
principle
plays
some
role.
now,
if
every
area
that
is
touched
by
that
principle
is
automatically
protected
by
703
(h),
i
question
whether
we
--
congress
did
not
enact
the
seniority
protection
act
of
1964
rather
than
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
james
wolpman
no
greater
a
swath,
your
honor.
mr.
james
wolpman
well
--
mr.
james
wolpman
they
say
that
it
is
a
senior
--
and
they
actually
adopt
our
reasoning.
they
say
that
anything
that
overrides
seniority
is
not
a
seniority
system.
but
then
they
adopt
a
definition
of
the
people
who
can
compete
in
a
system
that
--
that
sort
of
brings
in
the
back
there
all
of
my
words.
mr.
james
wolpman
in
their
view,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
wolpman
it
certainly
affects
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
many
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
seasonal
industry,
and
i
think
that
in
--
in
analyzing
this
problem,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
inevitably
meet
the
question
of
--
of
just
how
broad
703
(h)
could
be.
that
it
shouldn't
include
these
countervailing
considerations
and
that's
important.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
james
wolpman
yes,
your
honor.
the
difficulties
however
of
the
temporary
employee
in
asserting
his
powers
within
the
union
is
--
is
something
that
i
can
only
point
to,
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
record.
i
can
only
say
that
this
court
in
--
in
the
veterans
cases
has
not
turned
its
back
on
--
on
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
seniority
and
left
it
entirely
to
the
--
to
whatever
the
union
and
the
manage
--
management
happen
to
say.
i
think
it
maybe
--
you
know,
it's
an
old
and
very
sad
story.
when
people
can't
clean
their
own
houses,
the
government
sometimes
has
to
clean
it
for
them.
and
the
history
of
the
intrusion
of
the
government
in
the
area
of
discrimination
into
employment
relationships
is
one
that
has
showed
a
great
deal
of
patience
and
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
government
up
until
1944
when
the
steele
case
was
--
steele
versus
louisville
and
--
and
nashville
railway
case
was
decided,
the
government
has
stayed
out
of
this
area.
then
in
1944,
it
entered
the
fray
because
of
what
--
what
was
--
i
can
only
characterize
it
as
abysmal
discrimination.
but
then
--
mr.
james
wolpman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
decide
what
is
a
seniority
system.
it
only
becomes
critical
not
in
the
--
in
the
racial
case,
in
a
racial
situation
because
of
the
way
the
legislation
is
drawn
of
course,
but
i
think
we
do
have
to
work
toward
a
--
an
analysis
as
to
--
mr.
james
wolpman
well,
that
would
have
to
be
gotten
not
only
for
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
your
honor.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
probably
under
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
we
had
for
20
years
and
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose,
what
it
--
that
it
was
supposes
to.
it
made
it
impossible
to
get
at
this
kind
of
situation.
under
title
--
under
title
vii
which
again
after
20
years,
congress
decided
that
it
could
not
countenance
what
was
going
on
in
the
workplace
and
it
came
in
with
another
stronger
test.
it
wasn't
the
duty
of
fair
representation
test,
it
was
the
business
necessity
test.
and
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
court
sees
a
tremendous
amount
of
patience
and
it's
time.s
mr.
james
wolpman
right,
your
honor.
i
can
only
come
into
--
we
certainly
don't
--
i
do
not
know
the
internal
affairs
of
these
unions,
i
can
only
point
to
my
years
of
experience
in
the
difficulties
that
younger
people
have
in
--
in
asserting
power
in
--
in
some
sorts
of
unions.
i
--
i
--
that's
all
i
could
say
about
that,
i
mean
we
could
develop
that
as
we
develop
the
record.
mr.
james
wolpman
i
think
with
--
well,
we
have
to
decide
first
of
all,
is
this
a
seniority
system?
and
i
think
there
is
a
record
to
do
that,
to
whether
this
is
--
whether
this
is
--
mr.
james
wolpman
no.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
the
seniority
system
is
a
creature
of
contract.
is
there
--
we
can
look
at
the
contract
which
is
before
this
court,
and
say,
“is
there
a
mechanism
in
there
which
protects
the
accumulation
of
services
--
of
service
as
a
way
of
advancing?”
and
i
think
we
can
see
from
the
45-week
provision
that
it
does
not.
thank
you.
