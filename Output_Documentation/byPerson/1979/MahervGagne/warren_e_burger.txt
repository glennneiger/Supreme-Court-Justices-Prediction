chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
analogy,
ms.
pilver,
in
this
situation
and
the
one
where
parties
will
agree
or
stipulate
consent
to
liability
but
submits
for
a
litigated
basis
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
it
was
settled
on
the
merits
or
litigated
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.

you,
