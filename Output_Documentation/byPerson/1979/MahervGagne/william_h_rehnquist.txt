justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
walsh,
looking
at
page
21a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
did
their
consent
decree
reserve
to
the
court
the
right
to
fix
attorney's
fees
for
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
state,
in
effect,
consented
that
after
the
consent
decree
was
entered
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
or
a
new
suit
for
attorney's
fees
could
be
brought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
also
say
that,
at
least
orally,
you
did
not
agree
that
the
consent
decree
settled
all
the
issues
in
the
case,
including
the
issues
of
whether
attorney's
fees
should
be
awarded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
been
away
from
the
private
practice
for
ten
years
and
perhaps
things
have
changed
a
good
deal
since
then,
but
for
instance
in
other
federal
statutes
like
title
vii
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
equal
credit
opportunity
act
also
provide
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
and
in
the
sixties,
at
any
rate,
it
was
the
practice
if
you
were
settling
a
case
and
the
statute
authorized
an
award
under
which
the
plaintiff
was
suing
authorized
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
the
prevailing
party,
you
settled
that
at
the
same
time.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
in
dispute
and
if
you
were
going
to
settle
the
case,
you
settled
whether
or
not
the
person
was
going
to
get
attorney's
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
certainly
true
in
any
litigation
that
i
am
familiar
with,
is
that
one
of
the
things
on
the
table,
so
to
speak,
is
whether
the
plaintiff
recovers
not
only
$150,000
for
the
loss
of
an
arm
but
$25,000
attorney's
fees.
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
and
costs.
and
you
simply
negotiate
those
out.
you
may
have
to
give
up
some
substantive
right
or
give
up
some
part
of
your
substantive
recovery
in
order
to
get
your
attorney's
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
typical
in
a
contingent
fee
action,
too,
isn't
it,
where
you
have
a
plaintiff
who
doesn't
--
has
little
or
no
money
and
is
dependent
upon
the
recovery
to
pay
his
own
attorney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
pilver,
do
you
make
anything
at
all
of
the
first
paragraph
in
the
consent
decree
saying
nothing
in
this
consent
decree
is
intended
to
constitute
an
admission
of
fault
by
either
party
to
this
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
defendant
hadn't
accused
her
of
any
fault.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant
hadn't
accused
her
of
any
fault,
had
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
regarded
this
as
just
kind
of
boiler-plate
that
you
stuck
in
the
request
of
the
defendants?
