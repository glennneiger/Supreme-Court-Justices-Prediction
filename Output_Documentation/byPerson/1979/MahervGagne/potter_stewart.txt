justice
potter
stewart
mr.
walsh,
maybe
you
have
already
covered
it.
the
underlying
claim
here
is
the
same
kind
mr.
justice
white
described,
both
constitutional
and
statutory,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
was
here
an
underlying
constitution
--
there
is
an
allegation
of
violation
of
the
constitution
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
what
says
that
is
a
part
of
federal
jurisdiction,
is
the
statutory
claim
is
pendent
to
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
constitutional
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
there
was
both
a
constitutional
and
a
statutory
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
so
doesn't
it
fit
the
description
of
the
kind
of
case
in
which
the
statute
allows
attorney's
fees.
it
is
a
proceeding
brought
under
1983
in
view
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
underlying
claims
is
the
constitutional
character.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
don't
argue
that
1983
confers
any
substantive
rights.
as
i
understand,
they
say
their
substantive
rights
were
protected
(a)
by
the
constitution
--
the
merits
of
that
wasn't
resolved
--
(b)
by
the
statute.
that
is
where
the
substantive
rights
come
from.
i
don't
think
they
rely
on
1983
as
granting
themselves
the
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
1988
gives
them
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
they
say
it
was
brought
under
1983,
because
the
--
one
of
the
underlying
substantive
rights
was
conferred
by
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
first
difference
cited?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it
agreed
that
boiler
plate
--
have
you
ever
seen
a
stipulation
of
this
kind
to
a
consent
decree
that
doesn't
have
it
in?
justice
potter
stewart
you
will
settle
that
the
rule
admit
nothing?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
can
i
interrupt
you
on
the
question
of
whether
the
legislative
history
supports
the
notion
that
fees
might
be
awarded
as
part
of
the
cost.
i
think
the
statute
itself,
which
you
quote
on
pages
3
and
4
of
your
brief,
ends
up
by
saying
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
doesn't
that
kind
of
imply
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
costs?
