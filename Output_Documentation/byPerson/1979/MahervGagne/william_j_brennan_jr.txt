justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
there
still
another
difference.
in
hutto
the
constitutional
claim
was
an
eighth
amendment
claim
and
here
the
constitutional
claim
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
and
in
hutto
mr.
justice
rehnquist
thought
that
might
be
significant.
so
maybe
you
have
a
response
to
his
position
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
have
that
obstacle,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
one
sense
your
case
is
stronger
than
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
