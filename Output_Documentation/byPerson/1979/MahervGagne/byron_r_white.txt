justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
in
a
case
like
that
where
there
is
unquestionably
a
constitutional
claim
joined
with
a
statutory
claim
and
the
court
proceeds
to
decide
the
statutory
claim,
never
reaches
the
constitutional
claim,
and
the
plaintiff
wins
on
the
statutory
claim.
is
it
your
position
that
no
fees
are
allowable?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
practice
in
the
courts
now
or
are
holdings
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
they
decide
only
the
statutory
claim
there
is
fees
available
because
of
the
joinder
of
a
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
those
cases
are
right,
then
this
case
is
right,
too,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
is
not
part
of
the
case,
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
the
judge
addressed
the
statutory
issue
first
and
found
against
you.
i
suppose
the
statutory
claim
was
that
the
state
law
was
inconsistent
with
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
called
a
statutory
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
although
it
is
a
supremacy
clause
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
judge
had
said
this
is
wholly
consistent
with
say
federal
law
and
then
he
had
gotten
to
the
constitutional
claim
and
said,
well,
both
the
state
and
the
federal
law
are
unconstitutional
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
would
there
be
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
your
settlement
agreement
had
expressly
recited
that
you
were
settling
both
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
suit
would
still
have
been
brought
for
exactly
same
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
costs.
