mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
through
the
second
circuit.
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
awarded
attorney's
fees
against
the
petitioner,
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
income
maintenance
in
his
official
capacity
to
be
paid
out
of
state
funds
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
the
respondent's
attorneys
in
the
amount
of
some
$3,000.
the
district
court
found
the
award
to
be
authorized
by
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
to
the
plaintiff
as
the
prevailing
party.
the
case
was
settled
by
consent
decree.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
it
did
not,
your
honor,
but
in
all
candor
it
must
be
said
that
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree
the
state
proposed
that
each
party
would
pay
its
own
costs
and
the
respondents'
attorneys
refused
to
agree
to
that
and
we
decided
we
would
leave
it
to
the
district
court
when
they
brought
a
motion
subsequently
for
attorney's
fees.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
only
way
that
we
could
get
the
consent
decree
signed.
we
do
not
agree
that
attorney's
fees
were
awarded.
we
do
not
agree
to
awarding
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
just
apprised
the
district
court
judge
of
our
agreement
that
we
had
not
remained
silent
and
it
was
not
to
be
inferred
that
the
agreement
was
inclusive.
in
other
words,
they
reserved
the
right
to
bring
the
motion
before
the
court,
if
i
am
answering
your
question
correctly.
the
gagne
case
presents
two
issues
to
this
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
award
is
in
fact
authorized
by
the
attorney's
fees
awards
act
or,
conversely,
whether
or
not
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
such
an
award.
and,
secondly,
even
if
the
award
is
authorized
--
is
not
authorized
by
the
fees
act,
whether
or
not
as
the
second
circuit
has
held
the
award
has
but
the
ancillary
effect
of
an
award
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
under
edelman
v.
jordan
and
would
not
be
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
case
began
when
the
respondent,
who
was
a
recipient
under
connecticut's
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program,
challenged
the
state's
practices
and
policies
with
respect
to
awarding
her
her
employment
expenses.
she
was
employed
at
full-time
and
under
the
federal
statute,
section
402(a)(7)
of
the
social
security
act,
that
statute
required
that
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income
will
be
--
must
be
deducted
from
a
person's
gross
earnings
in
computing
the
amount
of
their
welfare
assistance
award.
the
respondent
claims
specifically
that
the
departments
imposed
a
maximum
allowance
with
respect
to
transportation
allowance
for
her
private
automobile
at
6
cents
a
mile
and
a
maximum
lunch
allowance
of
50
percents
per
lunch.
she
also
claimed
that
they
did
not
allow
her
certain
work-related
clothing
expenses
which
she
had.
before
bringing
the
action
the
respondent
requested
and
received
an
administrative
fair
hearing
on
these
issues
of
the
expenses
and
the
state
was
upheld
on
the
transportation
and
lunch
expenses.
it
was
directed
to
award
her
any
fee
she
had
for
work-related
clothing
which
she
could
prove.
and
the
fourth
issue
she
brought
at
the
administrative
hearing
was
abandoned
when
she
brought
this
case.
she
also
claimed
she
was
entitled
to
deduct
her
16-year-old
son's
working
expenses
from
her
award.
five
months
after
bringing
the
suit
the
state
amended
its
policy
which
is
contained
at
a66
of
the
appendix
so
as
to
provide
expressly
that
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
employment
were
to
be
allowed
to
afdc
recipients
and
the
amended
policy
is
at
a68
and
69
of
the
appendix.
subsequently,
about
a
year,
in
september
of
1976,
the
plaintiff
filed
an
amended
complaint
claiming
that
the
new
policy
as
revised
still
routinely
disallowed
expenses
of
the
plaintiff.
finally,
after
some
discovery,
the
consent
decree
was
entered
into
and
the
district
court
i
think
awaited
this
court's
decision
in
hutto
v.
finney
and
subsequently
entered
its
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
favor
of
plaintiff's
attorneys
of
approximately
$3,000
as
the
prevailing
party
under
the
fees
act.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
award,
holding
that
the
attorney's
fees
award
act
authorized
a
fee
payable
against
the
state
in
a
case
where
the
--
a
constitutional
claim
was
combined
with
a
statutory
claim
under
1983
and
the
case
was
settled
without
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
so
long
as
there
was
a
common
of
operative
fact
between
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
claim.
the
state
claims
that
the
court
of
appeals
test
which
was
adopted
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
house
report
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
which
held
that
in
order
to
abrogate
the
state's
eleventh
immunity
congress
must
be
acting
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce
a
substantive
guarantee
of
that
amendment.
it
has
become
clear
since
this
court
decided
chapman
v.
houston
welfare
rights
organization,
last
june
i
believe
it
was,
that
the
respondent,
in
our
view,
did
not
even
assert,
much
less
prevail,
upon
a
claim
seeking
to
enforce
a
substantive
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
arrived
at
that
conclusion
by
the
fact
that
in
chapman
this
court
said
that
standing
alone,
section
19(a)(3)
confers
no
substantive
rights
on
a
plaintiff's
claim
and
that
you
must
look
to
the
underlying
statutory
claim
then
to
determine
what
is
the
substantive
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
claim.
and
in
this
case,
the
substantive
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
a
claim
to
enforce
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
what
had
been
somewhat
unclear
before
chapman
was
that
customarily
these
claims
for
welfare,
as
we
call
them,
were
asserted
in
the
format
also
of
a
constitutional
claim
of
violations
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
under
the
doctrine
of
hagans
v.
lavine
that
would
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
to
hear
the
case
and
unless
the
claim
was
wholly
insubstantial
or
frivolous
and
the
court
would
then
proceed
to
dispose
of
the
statutory
claim,
in
most
cases
the
constitutional
claim
was
never
decided.
and
so
we
claim
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
is
right,
your
honor.
no
fees
are
allowed
because
in
fact
we
say
that
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
would
say
that
there
are
several
holdings
otherwise.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
as
long
as
the
claim
has
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
facts.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
now,
precisely
what
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
would
be
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
the
claim
in
this
case.
it
may
have
supported
it
in
hutto
v.
finney.
that
was
a
case
where
a
constitutional
violation
was
found.
in
this
case
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
found
and
the
legislative
history
does
not
address
specifically
the
eleventh
amendment
state
immunity
but
the
district
court
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
the
house
report
which
provided
that
when
the
claims
are
combined
that
an
award
may
be
made.
but
it
is
our
claim
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
or
purport
to
abrogate
the
threshold
requirement
of
fitzpatrick,
which
is
that
the
threshold
fact
of
congressional
authorization
abrogated
state's
immunity
could
only
be
present
when
there
is
authorization
of
congress
specifically
authorizing
a
suit
against
the
state
in
a
claim
and
in
legislation
enacted
pursuant
to
section
5
to
enforce
the
substantive
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
if
congress
meant
nevertheless
to
make
a
pronouncement
that
we
declare
we
are
enforcing
a
substantive
guarantee
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
we
say
any
claim
brought
under
section
1983,
i
don't
think
the
history
justifies
that,
because
i
think
you
must
read
when
it
says
any
claim
brought
it
is
implicit
that
it
means
any
claim
brought
to
enforce
civil
rights
or
a
substantive
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
under
the
analysis
of
the
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
would
say
"no,"
your
honor,
under
the
analysis
of
chapman,
because
in
a
case
of
this
kind
that
is
just,
if
you
will,
the
admission
ticket
that
the
federal
court
in
1983
--
but
the
underlying
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
you
cannot
tell
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
until
you
examine
the
underlying
statute,
which
is
the
substantive
basis
of
the
1983
claim.
and
chapman
says
1983
confers
no
substantive
benefits
--
rights
on
a
claim
of
and
by
itself
you
must
look
to
the
underlying
claim.
now
of
course
if
the
statutory
claim
was
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no,
your
honor,
i
think
1983
is
never
passed,
it
is
just
an
admission
ticket
to
get
the
federal
court,
it
is
the
underlying
claim
that
determines
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim
is
being
enforced.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
i
referred
to
the
underlying
claim.
you
mean
the
statutory
claim
and
the
1983
claim
is
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
there
is
a
recital
of
a
constitutional
claim,
your
honor.
our
position
is
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
under
hagans
v.
lavine.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
but
under
chapman,
when
you
analyze
the
chapman
decision,
that
this
court
has
analyzed
it,
it
really
says
there
is
no
constitutional
claim
because
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
chapman
was
a
jurisdictional
question,
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
no
constitutional
claim.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
see,
your
honor,
chapman
tells
us
that
1983
confers
no
substantive
rights.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well,
they
may
be
relying
on
1988
but
when
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
1988
provides
that
in
any
claim
brought
under
1983.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
but
we
say
congress
didn't
mean
any
claim
when
they
said
any
claim.
we
say
it
is
implicit
that
they
meant
any
claim
brought
to
enforce
a
civil
rights
or
a
substantive
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
how
it
must
be
read,
that
in
effect
they
really
did
not
agree
with
the
constitutional
claim,
even
though
they
recited
one.
that
is
what
we
get
out
of
chapman.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well,
unfortunately
that
is
the
trouble.
the
liberal
test
of
hagans
v.
lavine
has
been
determined
that
the
very
liberal
substantiality
test
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
--
the
court
will
say
it
is
sufficient
to
get
a
federal
court
who
will
consider
the
statutory
claim.
but
that
still
does
not
confer,
as
i
understand
chapman,
any
substantive
constitutional
rights
on
the
plaintiff's
claim.
you
must
look
to
the
underlying
statute.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
now,
the
respondent
has
also
cited
the
case
of
katzenbach
v.
morgan
proposition,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
that
congress
--
once
congress
has
determined
that
it
was
acting
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
has
been
suggested
they
said
when
we
enacted
1983
we
were
acting
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
is
not
for
this
court
even
to
question
congress
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
a
proper
exercise
of
their
power
under
section
5.
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
katzenbach
spoke
about
that
problem,
saying
that
if
congress
was
making
that
claim
they
were
claiming
they
had
a
right
themselves,
alone,
without
review
by
this
court,
to
define
the
substantive
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
give
congress
the
right
to
alter
decisions
of
this
court.
in
fact,
we
think
that
that
is
what
happened
here,
in
effect
the
legislative
history
was
used
to
alter
provision
of
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
because
under
this
test
of
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact
it
isn't
essential
that
congress
be
acting
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment;
they
may
be
or
they
may
not
be;
precisely
what
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact
between
a
statutory
claim
and
a
constitutional
claim
is
unclear.
if
the
statutory
claim
itself
provided
for
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
would
be
no
problem
and
there
would
be
no
case.
now,
of
course
the
senate
report
in
the
legislative
history
points
out
at
page
6342
of
the
1977
congressional
notes
that
the
act
is
limited
to
causes
arising
under
our
civil
rights
laws.
and
of
course
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
stated
to
cure
the
gaps
brought
about
the
alyeska
decision
in
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
and
civil
rights
cases.
and
so
we
say
congress
only
intended
when
they
enacted
the
fees
act
to
authorize
fees
for
claims
brought
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
were
not
trying
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
guarantee,
although
they
did
recite
1983
and
claimed
their
statutory
claim
in
terms
of
constitutional
due
process
and
equal
protection.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
supremacy
clause
claim;
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
violation
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
--
a
constitutional
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
be
interpreted
as
enforcing
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
--
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
the
plaintiff's
action
as
an
action
brought
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well,
under
my
analysis,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
is
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
trouble
is
that
these
actions
are
brought
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
question
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
1331
because
of
a
$10,000
limitation.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
at
any
rate,
the
senate
report
says
that
the
fees
act
was
intended
to
just
be
limited
to
civil
rights
cases.
this
is
not
a
civil
rights
case.
and
so
we
think
congress
and
the
legislative
history
had
no
such
intention
of
abrogating
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
now,
the
second
issue
in
the
case
is,
as
the
second
circuit
held,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
a
bar
to
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
case
in
any
event,
because
it
comes
within
the
permissible
ancillary
effect
doctrine
of
edelman
v.
jordan
which
held
that
a
state
may
be
required
to
expend
funds
from
its
treasury
when
it
is
enforcing
an
order
limited
to
prospective
injunctive
relief
and
the
subject
case
has
an
ancillary
effect
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
circuits
are
divided
on
this
question,
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
in
its
opinion.
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
think
that
the
respondent's
brief
concedes,
that
this
is
an
extension
of
the
careful
definition
of
what
an
ancillary
effect
was
in
edelman,
and
it
is
an
expansion
of
that
doctrine
from

which
is

of
compliance
with
an

conjunctive
relief

fee
awarded
in
a
case
brought
to
obtain
an
order
for

conjunctive
relief.brought
to
obtain
an

and
so
consequently
we
feel
it
is
not
in
accord
with
edelman
v.
jordan,
the
ancillary
effect,
and
that
it
should
--
consequently
for
both
those
reasons
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
and
there
was
a
cross
appeal
which
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
respondent's
cross
appeal,
and
that
should
be
--
if
the
case
is
dismissed,
that
should
be
vacated.
i
would
like,
your
honor,
to
save
any
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
a
couple
of
points.
in
hutto
v.
finney
this
court
stated
that
attorney's
fees
may
be
awarded
as
part
of
the
costs
and
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
seem
to
be
a
bar
there.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
i
don't
think
that
the
legislative
history
warranted
that
conclusion.
at
least,
even
if
it
did
in
this
case,
if
it
is
true
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
seeking
to
enforce
a
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
and
there
is
no
congressional
authorization,
even
if
the
congress
has
the
power
to
give
such
authorization
under
the
fees
awards
act,
this
court
distinguished
hutto
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
but
is
it
part
of
the
cost
where
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
an
issue.
we
see
the
fees
act,
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
policy
of
the
act
all
indicated
that
they
were
not
enacting
any
startling
new
legislation,
it
was
just
to
fill
gaps
created
by
the
alyeska
decision.
now,
actually
the
costs
have
not
been
changed
since
think
the
judiciary
act
of
1853
and
so
if
that
was
their
intention,
i
think
that
would
have
been
more
than
just
no
startling
new
remedy
legislation
and
just
to
fill
in
the
gaps.
but
in
a
case
where
civil
rights
are
not
being
enforced
there
is
no
authorization,
i
think,
in
the
legislative
history
specifically
to
abrogate
that
amendment
in
a
non-civil
rights
case.
congress
doesn't
claim
such
a
policy.
it
may
have
such
power,
but
it
doesn't
claim
it
in
this
act.
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
and
that
is
that
hutto
itself
distinguished
fitzpatrick
from
edelman
and
it
said
fitzpatrick
begins
where
edelman
ends.
but
this
case
is
very
similar
to
edelman.
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
in
edelman
of
equal
protection
and
there
was
statutory
social
security
claim.
so
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
edelman
controls
this
case
and
that
this
case
ends
where
edelman
ended.
and
fitzpatrick
began
where
there
was
a
threshold
question
of
congressional
authorization,
which
isn't
present
here.
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
other
remark
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
earlier
question.
my
point
was
that
chapman
says
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
u.s.
code
1343
for
1344
to
hear
a
case
in
which
there
is
just
statutory
claim.
and
so
it
may
well
be
that
in
this
case
we
have
what
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
decision
of
employees,
a
constitutional
claim
which
the
federal
district
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
because
congress
has
not
given,
only
implemented
its
article
3
power
to
award
that
jurisdiction.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
remarks
about
being
a
customary
provision,
a
boiler
plate,
if
you
will,
we
would
just
point
out
that
there
was
only
one
single
plaintiff
throughout
the
entire
more
than
two
years
of
litigation
in
this
and
that
the
plaintiff
in
the
consent
decree
did
not
obtain
the
injunctive
relief
which
he
sought;
she
did
not
obtain
the
equivalent
of
the
injunctive
relief
she
sought,
because
the
state
did
not
change
its
amended
policy,
it
is
still
in
effect.
that
is
the
one
contained
in
the
appendix
at
paragraph
--
pages
68
and
69.
so
we
think
that
edelman
v.
jordan
should
be
controlling
in
this
case
because
it
is
so
similar
to
edelman
v.
jordan.
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision.
thank
you
very
much.
