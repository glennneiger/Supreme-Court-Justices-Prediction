ms.
joan
e.
pilver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joan
pilver
and
i
represent
the
respondent
virginia
gagne
in
this
matter.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
offering
just
a
further
response
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
with
regard
to
why
the
matter
of
the
attorney's
fees
was
not
taken
up
in
the
consent
decree
itself,
and
there
are
really
two
reasons.
one,
because
we
felt
it
would
create
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
situation,
which
we
think
can
arise
in
any
situation
where
attorney's
fees
are
attempted
to
be
resolved
with
any
consent
decree.
the
fact
that
there
was
a
legal
dispute
between
the
parties
meant
that
there
would
have
been
no
way
the
matter
could
have
been
resolved
with
with
any
consent
decree
and,
in
fact,
the
entire
consent
decree
would
not
have
been
able
to
have
been
entered
if
in
fact
we
had
waited
--
had
insisted
on
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees
being
in
the
consent
decree
itself.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
i
think
that
is
a
good
point,
your
honor.
however,
i
would
suggest
in
this
particular
case
the
law
in
this
area
was
very
unclear.
the
defendant
took
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
right
we
were
not
entitled
--
as
a
matter
of
law
we
were
not
entitled
to
attorney's
fees,
and
this
was
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hutto
v.
finney.
so
it
was
really
a
legal
decision
that
had
to
be
made
by
the
court.
additionally,
i
think
several
courts
have
expressed
the
opinion,
in
particular
a
recent
decision
by
the
court
in
prandini
v.
national
tea
company,
of
the
various
kinds
of
potential
conflicts
of
interest
that
can
arise
when
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees
is
settled
within
the
consent
decree
itself,
the
fact
that
some
of
the
substantive
provisions
in
the
consent
decree
can
be
bargained
away
in
exchange
for
the
attorney's
fees.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
i
think
that
is
very
possible
in
those
cases
where
the
plaintiff
would
otherwise
have
to
pay
his
counsel's
attorney's
fees.
in
many
of
the
cases
brought
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
the
plaintiff
will
have
no
fees
with
which
to
pay
his
counsel
and
the
only
fee
that
will
be
paid
will
come
from
the
defendant.
so
that
where
the
only
interest
that
the
plaintiff
has
is
in
the
substantive
settlement
and
the
attorney's
interest
on
the
other
hand
is
in
the
recovering
and
in
that--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
i
think
there
is
a
similarity
and
i
think
that
kind
of
approach
is
very
useful
to
settle
the
merits
of
the
case
first
and
then
allow
those
other
matters
to
be
handled
either
in
a
separate
negotiation
or
if
they
cannot
settle
it,
then
to
allow
it
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
i
think
in
these
kind
of
cases
i
think
it
is
really
something
that
should
be
encouraged
because
of
the
potential
problems
that
can
arise.
two
terms
ago
this
court
in
hutto
v.
finney
held
that
congress
has
plenary
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
set
aside
a
state's
immunity
from
retroactive
relief
and
permit
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
be
entered
against
state
officials
acting
in
their
official
capacity
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976.
the
case
before
you
today
differs
from
hutto
in
only
two
respects,
neither
of
which
do
we
believe
are
material
or
sufficiently
different
to
justify
a
result
different
from
that
in
hutto.
while
the
case
in
hutto
was
settled
on
the
merits,
this
case
was
resolved
by
consent
decree.
and
while
in
hutto
on
the
--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
it
was
--
i
am
sorry
--
litigated
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
this
case
was
settled.
while
the
claims
in
hutto
were
based
solely
on
the
constitution,
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
coupled
her
constitutional
claim
with
a
claim
under
the
social
security
act.
the
plaintiff
maintains
that
neither
these
differences
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
any
kind
of
result
that
would
be
different
from
that
in
hutto.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
the
first
difference
is
the
fact
that
in
hutto
the
case
was
tried
on
the
merits.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
and
in
this
case
it
was
settled.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
the
civil
rights
attorney's
--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
well,
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
position
in
hutto,
it
was
that
because
the
eight
amendment
has
been
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
is
not
as
clear
that
in
the
past
in
acting
pursuant
to
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
--
that
--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
no,
we
don't.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
yes,
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
that
is
true,
this
is.
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
itself
sets
only
two
criteria
that
must
be
met
before
an
award
of
fees
can
be
made
under
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
one,
it
must
be
brought
under
one
of
the
enumerated
statutes.
and,
two,
the
prevailing
party,
the
person
who
is
seeking
the
fees
must
be
the
prevailing
party.
we
believe
that
this
case
meets
both
criteria.
it
is
clear
that
this
case
was
brought
under
one
of
the
enumerated
statutes,
namely
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
plaintiff
alleged
constitutional
claims
which
both
courts
below
found
to
be
substantial
under
the
relevant
hagans
v.
lavine
test,
the
test
which
was
also
suggested
by
congress
to
be
used
in
these
kinds
of
instances.
the
defendant,
however,
suggests
that
this
case
is
not
properly
brought
under
42
u.s.c.
1983
because
the
plaintiff
coupled
her
constitutional
claims
with
statutory
claims.
but
this
court
has
yet
to
hold
that
a
statutory
claim
may
not
be
properly
brought
under
42
u.s.c.
1983.
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
so
hold
in
a
future
case,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
decision
here
because
in
this
case
a
claim
was
properly
brought
under
the
constitution,
thus
bringing
it
within
42
u.s.c.
1983.
additionally,
it
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
intended
for
awards
to
be
made
in
cases
joining
constitutional
and
statutory
claims.
in
the
debate
and
report
by
congress
it
indicated
that
they
wished
to
continue
the
practices
and
judicial
standard
that
had
been
established
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
fees
awards
act,
including
the
coupling
of
constitutional
and
statutory
claims.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
impact
that
a
decision
denying
fees
in
cases
joining
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
would
have,
the
fact
that
plaintiffs
would
be
discouraged
from
bringing
cases
if
their
rights
to
fees
could
so
easily
be
defeated,
the
fact
that
the
inability
to
award
fees
in
cases
joining
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
might
compel
judges
to
unnecessarily
decide
constitutional
questions,
thus
defeating
a
very
important
policy
of
this
court.
alternatively,
the
prospect
arises
that
a
plaintiff
who
believes
he
has
a
meritorious
statutory
claim
might
refrain
from
raising
it,
in
the
fear
that
if
he
were
to
prevail
on
the
statutory
claim
he
would
then
be
denied
fees.
this
possibility
alone
would
have
a
very
negative
impact
on
the
judicial
system.
the
plaintiff
thus
maintains
that
congress'
purpose
in
passing
the
fees
act
to
encourage
the
filing
of
meritorious
litigation
and
the
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
and
the
important
goals
and
judicial
economy,
judicial
efficiency
and
the
appropriate
adjudication
of
constitutional
questions
would
all
be
disturbed
if
this
court
were
not
to
allow
fees
in
cases
joining
constitutional
and
statutory
claims.
thus
the
plaintiff
believes
she
meets
the
first
criteria
set
out
in
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act.
additionally,
she
believes
that
she
meets
the
second
criteria,
namely
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party.
both
courts
below
believe
that
the
plaintiff
had
achieved
almost
all
that
she
had
sought
in
her
complaint
and
that
what
she
had
achieved
was
significant.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
the
case
below
concluded
that
the
defendant
changed
his
policies
reluctantly
and
only
under
the
pressure
of
this
suit.
it
is
vitally
important
that
plaintiffs
who
settle
be
treated
as
prevailing
parties
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
a
large
percentage
of
cases
that
are
filed
are
settled
and
as
an
option
often
thought
of
and
certainly
always
considered
by
parties
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
deny
that
option
to
parties
solely
for
them
to
be
able
to
insure
themselves
of
a
fee
award.
truly,
not
allowing
fees
in
cases
resolved
by
consent
decree
would
discourage
the
voluntary
settlement
of
disputes,
for
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
it
would
otherwise
require
parties
to
litigate
solely
to
insure
fee
award.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
that
is
something
that
was
agreed
to
solely
for
us,
for
the
parties
to
negotiate
the
settlement.
and
i
would
point
out
neither
did
the
plaintiff
agree
that
she
was
withdrawing
any
of
the
allegations
contained
in
her
complaint.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
i
am
sorry,
your
honor
--
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
no,
but
the
plaintiff
did
make
allegations
in
the
complaint
which,
you
know,
we
certainly
maintained
to
the
state
that
if
the
matter
had
gone
to
trial
that
we
would
have
prevailed.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
that
is
right,
i
haven't.
ms.
joan
e.
pilver
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
always
done
in
almost
every
case
that
i
have
ever
--
i
have
ever
dealt
with.
further,
as
i
mentioned
before,
we
feel
that
not
allowing
fees
except
in
the
context
of
a
consent
decree
could
create
a
potential
for
conflicts
of
interest
which,
you
know,
as
have
mentioned
and
which
i
think
is
something
that
should
be
considered
by
this
court.
again,
the
legislative
history
is
clear.
it
indicates
that
congress
intended
fees
to
be
awarded
in
cases
resolved
by
consent
judgment.
neither
would
permitting
an
award
of
fees
in
cases
resolved
by
consent
further
the
filing
of
nuisance
litigation,
which
is
certainly
of
concern
to
the
court,
because
it
is
clear
the
court
must
first
find
that
there
is
at
least
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
warranting
jurisdiction.
they
must
find
that
there
were
benefits
brought
about
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
and
that
the
benefits
that
resulted
came
because
of
the
plaintiff's
conduct
and
would
not
otherwise
have
occurred,
you
know,
regardless
of
the
plaintiff's
actions.
all
these
are
matters
that
the
defendant
remains
free
to
contest
in
any
hearing
on
attorney's
fees.
to
require
any
greater
showing
would
only
discourage
settlement
of
disputes
and
discourage
the
benefits
achieved
by
settlement,
the
saving
of
court
time
and
effort,
the
saving
of
time,
expense
and
effort
by
the
litigants,
the
parties
and
the
attorneys.
to
require
a
greater
showing
of
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
would
also
require
the
unnecessary
decision
of
constitutional
questions.
thus,
in
sum,
the
plaintiff
believes
she
meets
the
two
primary
criteria
set
out
in
the
fees
act
for
allowing
an
award
of
fees
to
be
made
in
this
case.
because,
however,
the
defendant
claims
that
he
is
subject
to
an
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
he
asserts
that
even
if
we
did
prevail,
even
if
we
are
entitled
to
fees
under
these
two
criteria,
we
are
nonetheless
barred
from
an
award.
the
plaintiff
believes,
however,
as
mentioned
earlier
that
hutto
v.
finney
is
the
appropriate
precedent
for
deciding
this
question.
the
validity
of
this
court's
ruling
that
in
passing
the
fees
act
congress
was
exercising
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
no
less
validity
in
a
case
resolved
by
consent
than
in
any
other.
the
legislative
history
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
hutto
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
states
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
act
in
this
case
only
but
to
further
by
the
additional
legislative
history
indicating
that
these
were
also
intended
to
be
awarded
in
cases
resolved
by
consent.
certainly
the
comparison
of
fees
to
cost
in
hutto
and
the
quotation
from
fairmont
creamery
company
v.
minnesota
that
a
court
interest
in
expeditious
and
orderly
proceedings
justifies
it
in
treating
a
state
as
any
other
litigant
has
no
less
validity
in
a
case
resolved
by
consent.
additionally,
although
not
explicitly
stated,
the
plaintiff
believes
that
the
court
in
hutto
implied
strongly
that
attorney's
fees,
being
so
closely
akin
to
cost,
that
like
cost
they
should
not
be
subject
to
a
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
we
believe
that
a
holding
by
this
court
to
that
effect
here
would
follow
logically
from
this
court's
holding
in
hutto
and
would
not
--
would
not
strain
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
court
in
edelman
v.
jordan
between
prospective
relief
and
the
cost
ancillary
thereto
and
retroactively,
which
is
akin
to
damages
and
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
even
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
attorney's
fees
are
generally
subject
to
the
eleventh
amendment
we
believe
that
congress
is
acting
appropriately
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
passing
legislation
allowing
fees
to
be
awarded
in
cases
resolved
by
consent.
through
extensive
hearings
congress
was
well
aware
that
many
parties
could
not
have
afford
the
legal
fees
involved
in
bringing
action
under
laws
passed
pursuant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
shifting
the
attorney's
fee
to
the
losing
party
was
a
reasonable
way
of
resolving
--
of
encouraging
such
litigation.
likewise,
congress
was
acting
reasonably
in
concluding
that
an
award
of
fees
in
consent
judgment
cases
also
furthered
that
policy.
congress
has
acted
remedially
in
giving
another
tool
of
use
to
the
judiciary
to
use
for
the
process
of
encouraging
the
filing
of
litigation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
tool
is
as
useful
in
consent
judgment
cases
as
in
any
other.
further,
the
act
leaves
the
ultimate
decision
as
to
whether
to
award
fees
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge,
leaving
it
to
him
to
decide
as
here
whether
there
was
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
justifying
a
finding
of
jurisdiction,
whether
the
benefits
achieved
were
valuable
and
whether
they
came
as
a
result
of
the
suit
having
been
brought.
thus,
congress,
even
in
settle
cases,
has
left
the
determination
and
the
interpretation
of
the
substantive
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
judiciary,
where
it
rightfully
belongs.
thus,
the
plaintiff
below
and
respondent
here
believe
that
the
award
of
fees
made
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
proper
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act
and
follows
logically
from,
and
is
consistent
with
this
court'
holding
in
hutto
v.
finney.
thank
you
very
much.
