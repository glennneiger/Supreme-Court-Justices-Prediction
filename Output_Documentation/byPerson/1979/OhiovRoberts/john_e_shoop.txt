mr.
john
e.
shoop
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
john
shoop,
lake
county
prosecuting
attorney,
representing
the
state
of
ohio,
petitioner
herein.
i
would
like
to
take
some
time,
with
the
court's
indulgence,
to
explain
some
of
the
facts
that
brought
the
case
before
this
court.
in
january
of
1975,
one
herschel
roberts
was
arrested
on
the
charge
of
forging
a
check.
at
that
time
he
was
afforded
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
mentor
municipal
court,
at
which
hearing
he
was
present
it
was
a
hearing
before
a
judicial
tribunal,
a
judge
the
hearing
was
recorded
witnesses
were
called
and
sworn
the
defendant
had
the
opportunity
and
the
use
of
counsel,
counsel
was
present
and
other
indicia
of
reliability
were
present
at
this
time
in
that
defendant
had
the
opportunity
to
use
the
compulsory
process
of
the
state
to
force
the
attendance
of
witnesses.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
all
right.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
the
witness
was
called
by
the
defense
counsel,
and
it
was
expected
then
that
this
witness
would
corroborate
something
in
light
of
the
defendant's
testimony,
or
anticipated
defense.
the
case
--
the
preliminary
hearing
proceeded,
and
after
the
calling
of
this
witness
and
the
discovery,
then,
by
the
defense
counsel,
that
this
witness
was
testifying
adversely
to
his
defendant,
the
defense
counsel,
without
objection
from
the
state,
without
objection
from
the
court,
began
to
ask
leading
and
argumentative
questions
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
technically,
we
have
abolished
the
voucher
rule.
but
we
do
have
a
provision
that
provides
that
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
counsel
can
ask
the
court
to
declare
the
witness
hostile
to
allow
him
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
now,
of
course,
with
no
objection
--
he
did
not
require
--
or
ask
the
court
at
that
time
and
that
could
be
because
there
was
no
objection
from
either
the
court
or
the
state
at
that
point.
without
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
no.
the
question
that
he
could
have
asked
was,
that
he
could
have
asked
the
court
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
of
his
own
free
will,
yes.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that's
totally
within
the
mind
of
the
attorney.
i
can't
tell
you
whether
he
had
asked
all
of
the
questions.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
and
i
believe
he
did.
and
i
feel
he
explored
this
witness,
anita
isaacs,
as
far
as
he
could
and
wanted
to
at
that
point.
the
hearing
continued,
and
of
course,
the
defendant
--
the
probable
cause
was
found,
and
the
defendant
was
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury.
he
was
subsequently
indicted.
fourteen
months
later
was
the
trial
on
the
action.
now,
this
was
in
march
of
1976.
all
of
these
delays
were
caused
by
either
the
absence
of
the
defendant
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
or,
one
delay
was
with
the
approval
of
the
state
there
was
one
joint
request
for
continuance.
at
the
trial,
the
case
in
chief
was
presented,
and
at
one
point
in
the
hearing,
mrs.
isaacs,
the
mother
of
the
absent
witness,
was
asked
if
she
knew
the
whereabouts
of
her
daughter,
anita
isaacs,
and
her
response
to
that
was,
"no,"
she
did
not.
now,
this
was
during
the
case
in
chief,
the
state's
case
in
chief.
subsequent
to
this,
the
defendant
put
on
his
testimony
and
evidence,
and
the
defense
attorney,
knowing
the
plan
of
the
prosecution
was
to
eventually
submit
evidence
of
a
prior
recorded
testimony,
under
oath,
of
this
absent
and
unavailable
witness,
requested
before
mrs.
isaacs,
the
mother
of
the
absent
witness,
could
leave
the
courtroom,
requested
a
voir
dire
examination
for
the
purposes
of
discovering
whether
or
not
this
witness
was
actually
unavailable.
this
was
the
defense
counsel
at
trial.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
not
at
all.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
question
of
unavailability
is
actually
present
before
this
court.
we
feel
that
the
question
of
unavailability
was
not
actually
raised.
it
was
not
presented
with
our
argument,
in
our
petition.
we
presumed,
in
our
petition,
that
the
unavailability
of
the
witness
has
already
been
determined.
it
has
been
determined
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
and
there
seems
to
be
no
question
of
the
unavailability
of
the
witness,
and
the
state's
good
faith
attempts
to
locate
that
witness.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
it
appears
that
--
yes,
even
though
we
had
a
four
to
three
decision
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
agreed
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
read
that
as
unavailable
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
way
the
state
could
produce
this
witness
at
the
trial,
in
order
to
present
her
testimony.
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
2945.49
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
which
permits
the
use
of
prior
recorded
testimony
under
oath,
when,
for
any
reason,
the
witness
is
unavailable,
the
supreme
court
determined
then
that
this
fact
is
established
this
witness
is
unavailable
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that's
the
very
essence,
i
believe,
of
our
argument
here
before
the
court,
that
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination,
in
the
proper
circumstances,
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
whether
or
not
actual
cross-examination
transpires.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
read
the
supreme
court's
argument,
or
decision,
as
that
both
unavailabilities
are
satisfied
in
this
case,
both
for
the
purposes
of
any
federal
implications,
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
state
statute.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes,
i
do.
i
believe
that
is
the
predicate
for
the
introduction
of
prior
recorded
testimony.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i'm
assuming
that
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
and
in
this
case,
that's
what
i
believe
was
decided.
subsequent
to
the
preliminary
hearing
and
eventual
trial,
the
introduction
of
the
testimony
was
permitted
of
the
unavailable
and
absent
witness.
that
was
over
the
objection
of
defense
counsel,
and
defense
counsel's
objection
was
to
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause.
there
were
two
appeals,
of
course,
prior
to
the
case
coming
here,
and
the
first
appeal
going
to
the
eleventh
district
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
ohio.
in
that
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
a
good-faith
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
was
not
shown,
and
that
the
defendant
was
denied
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation.
it
is
from
that
decision
that
we,
the
state
of
ohio,
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
at
that
point,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
ruled
that
the
witness
was
unavailable
we
had
made
every
good-faith
effort
we
could
make
and
decided
that
question
but
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
the
defendant
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses,
pursuant
to
this
state
statute,
was
denied
to
the
defendant
when
actual
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing
did
not
take
place.
it
is
from
that
decision
the
case
was
presented
and
is
here
before
the
court.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that
is
the
holding
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
they
found
that
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
don't
think
that
they
are
that
different
significantly
different.
i
believe
that
the
due
diligence
argument,
or
the
statement
of
the
court,
satisfies
the
fact
that
we
have
done
what
we
could
do
in
good
faith
to
provide
for
this
witness
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
believe
it's
a
matter
of
semantics,
your
honor.
i'm
not
convinced
that
that
is
--
that
they
said
otherwise.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that
is
one,
your
honor,
yes.
but
i
also
believe
that
the
question
of
unavailability
is
not
even
before
this
court.
now,
we
have
mentioned
it,
and
we
have
talked
about
it,
but
the
question
is
not
properly
presented
here.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that's
correct.
your
honor.
there
is
no
place
for
us
to
go.
the
question
of
unavailability,
or
whether
or
not
a
good
faith
effort
has
been
shown,
relies
and
presumes
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
unavailable
witness.
now,
in
every
instance
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited,
where
either
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
in
a
federal
penitentiary,
was
located
in
an
absent
state,
was
out
of
the
country
in
sweden
in
any
of
those
situations,
the
critical
factor
on
unavailability,
if
we're
going
to
argue
unavailability,
is
that
knowledge
of
where
that
absent
witness
is,
exists.
absent
that
knowledge
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
in
the
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
at
that
time
we
were
in
contact
with
mrs.
isaacs.
and
we
knew,
even
though
we
have
on
the
form,
on
some
of
these
subpoenas
--
it's
a
stamp
that
the
prosecutor's
office
applies
to
the
stamp,
in
order
to
help
us
know
whether
or
not
our
subpoenas
are
actually
being
served
or
not
--
in
this
case
we
knew
that
the
witness
was
gone
and
absent.
we
had
prior
contact
with
mrs.
isaacs,
the
mother.
and
we've
already
indicated
that
at
page
10
of
the
appendix,
where
mr.
perez
was
questioning
mrs.
isaacs
on
direct
examination,
and
he
talked
to
her
about
the
fact
that
"i
talked
to
you
some
five
months
earlier
in
november.
and
at
that
time
you
indicated
your
daughter
had
been
gone
and
absent
for
some
time."
and
in
fact,
we
had
knowledge
of
this.
where
to
look?
we
had
no
knowledge.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
there
was
nothing
more
for
us
to
do.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
--
i
apparently
have
forgotten
the
other
question.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
we
did
talk
with
the
parents.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes,
and
they
did
not
know
where
she
was.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes,
we
knew
there
had
been
a
contact
in
san
francisco.
that
was
one
month
after
--
one
or
two
months
after
the
original
incident,
which
would
have
been
in
april
or
may
of
'75.
subsequent
to
that
hearing,
or
that
notice,
there
was
a
notice
in
the
summer
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
and
at
least
in
november
the
state
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
witness
was
gone
and
absent.
and
we
had
no
knowledge
of
where
to
go
from
that
point
to
locate
her.
now,
what
more
the
rules
would
require
of
us,
i
cannot
imagine.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
oh,
it's
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
convenient.
if
that
is
the
application
that
is
used
of
this.
but
in
this
case
the
witness
was
unavailable.
and
it
is
not
unavailability
due
to
any
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
or
any
hindrance
by
the
prosecutor.
what
more
we
could
have
done,
whether
or
not
this
witness
was
here,
if
this
were
a
crucial
witness,
crucial
to
the
facts
and
to
the
establishment
of
the
crime,
the
prosecutor
might
be
left
with
no
alternative
but
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
proceed
on
the
case.
because
this
was
not
a
crucial
witness
at
this
point,
we
were
left
with
whatever
means
we
could
have
at
our
disposal
to
find
the
witness,
once
we
have
some
indication
of
where
that
witness
might
be.
the
question
then
presented
is,
where
a
witness,
called
by
a
criminal
defendant
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
testifies
in
a
manner
incriminating
the
defendant,
and
was
not
cross-examined,
although
there
was
opportunity
to
do
so,
and
that
witness
is
later
shown
to
be
unavailable
to
testify
at
the
trial,
the
same
defendant
on
the
same
charge,
does
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
preclude
the
state's
use
of
an
unavailable
witness'
prior
recorded
testimony?
the
use
of
prior
recorded
testimony
of
a
witness
who
is
unavailable
for
trial
is
not
repugnant
to
the
constitution
or
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
when
there
are
certain
indicia
of
reliability.
those
indicia
of
reliability
outlined
by
the
various
cases
that
have
been
cited
include
a
full-fledged
judicial
hearing
with
sworn
and
recorded
testimony
the
defendant
being
present
counsel
being
present
and
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
we
submit
that
all
of
the
indicia
of
reliability
were
present
in
this
case,
plus
others.
secondly,
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witness
is
the
key
to
whether
the
demands
of
the
confrontation
clause
are
met,
not
whether
actual
cross-examination
took
place.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court,
in
its
dissent,
summarizing,
barber,
green
and
pointer,
which
are
united
states
supreme
court
cases
on
this,
said
that
the
extent
of
the
cross-examination,
whether
at
a
preliminary
hearing
or
at
a
trial,
is
a
trial
tactic.
the
manner
of
use
of
that
trial
tactic
does
not
create
a
constitutional
right.
thirdly,
the
unavailability,
the
question
i
believe
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
and
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
presumes
the
unavailability,
and
the
respondent
did
not
cross-petition
on
this
issue,
which
he
now
attempts
to
raise.
further,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
have
determined
the
witness
to
be
unavailable
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
that
determination
should
not
be
disturbed.
finally,
where
the
testimony
is
taken
at
a
full-fledged
judicial
hearing,
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
regardless
of
the
use
made
of
that
opportunity.
a
full-fledged
judicial
hearing
existed
here
in
this
case,
which
closely
approximates
a
trial.green
mentions
factors
of
a
full-fledged
hearing.
and
they
are,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
judge
hearing
the
case,
the
witnesses
under
oath,
the
counsel
and
defendant
present,
the
judicial
record
to
assure
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
and
the
recording,
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
and
that
is
this
particular
witness
that
we
are
now
confronting
this
court
with.
furthermore,
besides
the
standards
laid
out
in
green
for
a
full-fledged
hearing,
this
afforded,
in
addition,
the
use
of
the
in
the
state
of
ohio,
full
use
of
evidence.
the
rules
of
evidence
are
mandated
for
preliminary
hearings
in
the
state
of
ohio.
compulsory
process,
the
full
panoply
of
the
criminal
rules
and
the
trial
procedures
are
available
for
the
defendant's
use.
now
once
we've
established
that
the
prior
recorded
testimony
was
taken
at
a
full-fledged
judicial
hearing,
then
we
submit
that
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause,
regardless
of
what
use
was
made
of
that
opportunity.
that
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
a
witness
called
on
direct
knows
that
they
will
be
subject
to
cross-examination,
and
yet
whether
actual
cross-examination
takes
place
is
not
known
until
the
completion
of
the
direct
examination.
therefore,
the
motivation
to
testify
truthfully
is
just
as
valid
before
the
cross-examination
as
it
could
be
afterwards.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
a
right
which
must
be
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waived,
as
certain
other
sixth
amendment
rights,
for
example,
the
right
to
counsel.
we
submit
that
the
confrontation
clause,
and
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
is
comparable
to
the
compulsory
process
clause
which
was
afforded
the
defendant.
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
makes
use
of
that
compulsory
process
clause,
or
waives
that
right,
he
does
not
have
to
waive,
or
give
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver,
of
that
right
to
compulsory
process.
we
submit
that
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
falls
within
that
sixth
amendment
right.
there
have
been
some
objections
throughout
the
briefs
raised
to
this
opportunity
alone
satisfying
the
confrontation
clause.
the
eleventh
district
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
ohio
stated
that
confrontation
is
a
trial
right
and
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
confrontation
right
is
a
trial
right.
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
right.
it
is
a
preferential
right,
as
mattox
so
noted.
according
to
mattox,
the
law
in
its
wisdom
declares
that
the
rights
of
the
public
shall
not
be
wholly
sacrificed
in
order
that
an
incidental
benefit
may
be
preserved
to
the
accused.
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
protection
is
preserved
to
the
prisoner
in
the
advantage
he
has
once
had
of
seeing
the
witness
face-to-face,
and
of
subjecting
him
to
cross-examination.
the
second
argument
that
has
been
raised
is
the
difference
in
structure
between
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
structure
of
the
trial.
in
ohio
the
structure
of
the
preliminary
hearing
follows
close
to
the
criminal
rules,
and
provides
a
full
panoply
of
constitutional
safeguards.
the
defendant
has
the
absolute
right
to
be
present
the
absolute
right
to
counsel
the
absolute
right
to
compulsory
process
the
absolute
right
to
cross-examination
the
full
use
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
he
has
--
he's
entitled
to
witnesses
under
oath
and
a
judicial
tribunal.
these
are
absolute
rights
preserved
to
a
defendant
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
and
they
so
closely
approximate
the
trial
that
there
is
rarely
much
of
a
difference
in
the
structure.
thirdly,
there
is
a
strategy
argument,
where
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
may
be
--
may
not
use
the
same
strategy
as
he
would
at
trial.
but
as
an
advisory
opinion,
and
i
believe
a
well-reasoned
opinion,
the
sixth
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
havey
v.
kropp,
cited
in
our
brief,
states
that
where
a
state
statute
exists
which
allows
use
of
prior
recorded
testimony,
and
counsel
has
notice
of
the
statute,
and
the
attorney
chooses
not
to
use
the
preliminary
hearingn
--
or
chooses
to
use
the
preliminary
hearing
as
a
fishing
expedition
or
to
fail
to
explore
the
weaknesses
in
the
state's
case,
does
so
at
his
client's
risk.
in
this
case,
we
do
have
a
state
statute
in
question
which
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
was
well
known
to
defense
counsel.
and
that
state
statute,
2945.49
of
the
ohio
revised
code
provides
that
prior
recorded
testimony
under
oath
can
be
used
at
a
subsequent
hearing
when
the
witness
is
unavailable.
finally,
the
defendant
in
this
case
actually
did
make
use
of
his
right
to
confront
the
witness
here,
which
establishes
compliance
with
the
confrontation
clause.
there
was
de
facto
cross-examination
of
the
witness.
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
testimony
is
taken,
including
the
leading
and
argumentative
questions
afforded
the
jury
at
trial,
a
satisfactory
basis
for
evaluating
the
truth
of
the
testimony.
thus
we
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
was
in
error
when
it
held
that
the
prior
recorded
testimony
of
an
unavailable
witness
was
constitutionally
inadmissible.
the
judgment
of
that
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
thank
you,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
couple
of
points
ohio
is
syllabus
rule
state,
in
case
there's
any
question
about
that.
a
fact
in
the
forgery
that
defense
counsel
attempted
to
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
the
headnote
is
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
correct.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
that's
it.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
the
forgery
in
this
case,
it
might
be
critical
to
listen
to
the
facts
of
the
forgery.
this
forgery
is
of
a
check.
there
were
credit
cards
involved,
but
we're
not
talking
about
forgery
of
a
credit
card,
or
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
call
this
absent
witness
to
say
that,
well,
she
gave
him
the
checks,
or
whatever.
the
check
was
not
signed
prior
to
the
time.
there
was
testimony
in
the
trial
transcript
--
i
believe
the
court
has
that
transcript
--
where
the
clerk
at
the
store
the
defendant
actually
signing
the
check.
and
it
was
from
that
--
at
that
point,
then,
that
the
complex
where
the
store
existed
the
--
had
been
alerted
to
the
fact
that
someone
--
this
defendant
had
been
in
a
prior
store
trying
to
use
these
credit
cards.
they
were
then
searching
through
the
mall
to
attempt
to
locate
this
individual.
five
subpoenas
were
issued
to
the
residence.
we
were
hoping
that
if
this
absent
witness
return,
or
come
anyplace
within
the
state,
it
would
be
back
to
the
parents'
home,
yes.
we
did
continue
to
serve
subpoenas
at
the
residence.
and
they
were
all
residence
service.
there
was
no
personal
service
that
we
were
able
to
obtain.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
which
testimony?
about
the
residence
service?
mr.
john
e.
shoop
no,
we
didn't
bring
this
testimony
in.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
the
unavailable
witness?
we
used
that
in
rebuttal.
it
was
not
used
in
our
case
in
chief.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
we
probably
could
have.
it
would
depend
on
the
essence
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand
and
say
that
"she
is
the
cause
of
this."
until
that
point
--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
it
may
not
have
been
relevant.
as
to
the
argument
of
lengthy
preliminary
hearings,
causing
court
congestion,
we've
heard
a
number
of
arguments
from
defense
counsel
about
timely
trial.
and
of
course
the
state
of
ohio
has
rules
about
time
to
trial,
for
speedy
trial,
and
they're
statutory.
the
rules
require
that
a
criminal
defendant,
once
he
has
been
arrested,
be
brought
to
trial
with
270
days.
if
he's
incarcerated
on
that
charge
without
bond,
he
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
90
days.
these
stipulations
and
charges
that
this
would
cause
court
congestion
were
raised,
of
course,
when
those
statutes
came
into
effect.
to
say
that
to
adopt
our
position
would
cause
lengthy
cross-examinations
i
feel
is
unjustified
and
should
not
be
sustained
by
this
court.
thank
you.
