justice
john
paul
stevens
or
did
they
say
that
due
diligence
would
not
have
procured
the
witness?
and
are
those
two
not
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
the
prosecution
do
other
than
to
serve
these
subpoenas
at
the
residence
of
the
parents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
you
do
when
the
requested
telephone
calls
did
not
come
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shoop,
is
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun,
that
because
of
the
prior
history,
you
did
nothing
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
nothing
more
than
he
described
in
his
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
to
both
my
questions
is
"nothing"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
asked,
generally,
what
you
did
other
than
serve
the
subpoenas
at
the
residence
of
the
missing
witness'
parents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
the
answer
to
that
is
nothing,
and
i
asked
you
positively
what
else
you
did.
and
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
is
nothing,
other
than
talk
to
the
parents,
and
know
she
was
gone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
knew
she
had
been
in
san
francisco,
some
other
places,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
this
opportunity
to
cross-examine
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
suppose
she
hadn't
been
a
witness
there
at
all.
and
yet
you
had
a
--
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
would
you
have
done
any
more?
it's
convenient
to
have
this
preliminary
hearing
transcript
available,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
you
don't
waive,
and
you
go,
and
the
government
puts
on
some--the
state
puts
on
some
witnesses
to
show
probable
cause.
do
you
cross-examine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
always?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
have
used
this
testimony
in
your
case
in
chief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
about
the
prior
--
did
you
use
this
in
your
case
in
chief?
i
thought
you
used
it
in
rebuttal,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
could
you
have?
i
suppose
you
--
on
your
presentation,
you
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
not
have
been
relevant
at
all?
