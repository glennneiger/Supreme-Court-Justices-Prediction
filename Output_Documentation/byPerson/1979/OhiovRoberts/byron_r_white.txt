justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
there
were
some
questions
he
wanted
to
but
didn't
ask,
because
of
any
rule
of
ohio
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
didn't.
and
--
but
do
you
think
he
terminated
his
examination
of
the
witness
he
called?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
short
of
asking
some
questions
that
he
wishes
now
he
had
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
was
free
to
ask
any
question
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
requirement
on
availability?
justice
byron
r.
white
you,
in
effect
--
you
read
the
ohio
court
as,
in
effect,
having
decided
two
questions
on
availability.
issue
one
is,
that
as
a
matter
of
the
state
statute,
the
witness
was
unavailable.
and
two,
the
a
sufficient
showing
was
made
to
avoid
the
confrontation
clause
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
but
if
you
read
the
last
sentence
of
the
paragraph,
the
reference
is
just
to
state
law
that's
how
he
answered
the
question.
and
i
think
the
court
may
have
assumed
the
two
tests
were
the
same.
i
wonder
if
you
assume
they're
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
the
same?
whatever
would
satisfy
a
state
requirement
on
availability
automatically
satisfies
the
federal
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let
me
get
that
straight.
what
you
just
described,
is
that
the
holding
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
or
of
an
intermediate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
ohio
supreme
court
actually
hold
that
you
had
made
a
good-faith
effort?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
you
just
defending
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
the
ohio
courts
all
the
way
along
have
considered
the
issue,
have
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
goes
off
on
the
opportunity
aspect.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
the
defense
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
from
your
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
retained?
justice
byron
r.
white
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
succeed
in
preventing
a
binding
over
because
you
cross-examined
someone?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say,
have
you
ever
succeeded
in
avoiding
a
binding
over
by
cross-examination
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
have
been
lucky.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
surely
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
my
state,
as
long
as
the
witness
testifies
something
that
adds
up
to
probable
cause,
the
magistrate
doesn't
even
weigh
credibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
waive?
so
that
--
at
least
you
learn
what
you
can
learn,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
very
briefly.
i
had
the
same
difficulty
justice
rehnquist
did
with
the
quote
on
page
28
of
your
brief,
and
i
wonder
--
you
won't
be
able
to
take
care
of
it
now,
but
perhaps
you
could
write
a
letter
to
the
court
and
tell
us
where
it
came
from.
i'm
quite
sure
it
didn't
come
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
be
happy
to.
again,
we
would
ask
this
honorable
court
to
affirm
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below
to
find
that
the
witness
--
even
if
finding
the
witness
unavailable,
the
differences
between
preliminary
hearings
and
trials
are
so
different
that
without
cross-examination
there
cannot
be
any
indicia
of
reliability.
and
even
with
cross-examination,
there
still
may
not
be
indicia
of
reliability.
and
therefore,
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
u.s.
constitution.
there
being
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
