mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
wish
to
expand
upon
the
facts
for
this
court
that
petitioner
has
given
to
give
you
some
additional
information.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
defendant
was
arrested
--
petitioner
was
arrested
on
january
7th,
1975.
his
preliminary
hearing
was
had
three
days
later,
january
10,
1975.
at
that
time
he
had
appointed
counsel.
i
don't
know
if
the
counsel
had
seen
him
prior
to
the
preliminary
hearing
or
not.
his
entire
defense
--
this
is
a
forgery
case,
and
also
some
receiving
stolen
property,
some
items,
a
chalice,
some
silverware
--
his
entire
defense
was
that
his,
quote,
girlfriend
had
given
him
certain
items,
that
she
had
given
him
a
checkbook
written
by
her
father,
the
complaining
witness,
and
that
she
gave
him
permission
to
use
these
items.
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
is
a
probable
cause
hearing
--
and
we
respectfully
differ
it
is
not
a
trial,
the
constitutional
rights
are
different
--
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
matter,
the
complaining
witness,
mr.
isaacs,
bernard
isaacs,
was
present,
i
assume,
since
i
was
not
the
attorney
then,
because
he
was
to
identify
the
checkbook
and
to
identify
the
stolen
objects,
alleged
stolen
objects.
at
the
time,
the
defense
counsel
saw
anita
isaacs
in
the
hallway.
she
was
not
subpoenaed.
he
called
her
to
the
stand.
he
called
her
to
the
stand
as
his
witness,
subject
to
direct
examination.
there
were
three
or
four
leading
questions,
not
objected
to
by
the
city
prosecutor
in
that
jurisdiction.
the
witness
testified
adversely.
the
court
of
appeals
below
stated
that
you
can
infer
from
her
actions
and
her
credibility
that
she
was
closely
linked
to
the
defendant.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct.
whether
or
not
i
would
have
called
this
witness
or
not
is
really
not
at
issue.
he
did
call
this
issue
on
direct.
but
it
certainly
was
not
a
cross-examination
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
he
asked
her
adverse
questions
right
from
the
start
--
i
shouldn't
say
adverse
he
asked
her
leading
questions
right
from
the
start.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
reading
the
transcript,
i
don't
think
anything
was
more
difficult
than
it
would
take
somebody
to
answer
in
30
seconds,
or
so.
i
don't
think
it
was
a
trial
type
of
cross-examination.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
can
assume
not
that's
correct.
but
again,
i
don't
believe
it
was
an
extensive
cross-examination.
at
any
event,
the
defendant-petitioner
was
bound
over
to
a
grand
jury,
subsequently
indicted.
the
matter
came
up
for
trial.
i
was
appointed
his
defense
counsel
approximately
in
february
of
'76,
a
little
bit
over
a
year
later.
the
matter
was
set
for
jury
trial
march
of
'76
--
i
don't
have
the
date
in
front
of
me
march
4th,
i
think,
1976.
and
it
went
to
trial.
and
the
trial,
in
--
after
the
witness
for
the
state,
mrs.
isaacs,
testified,
i
as
defense
counsel
requested
a
voir
dire
of
mrs.
isaacs
to
determine
unavailability.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
unavailability
up
until
the
point
that
i
as
defense
counsel
requested
it.
after
mrs.
isaacs
testified,
and
then
--
the
defendant
testified
--
when
they
rested,
the
defendant
testified,
the
state
of
ohio
as
rebuttal
brought
in
the
transcript
of
anita
isaacs.
the
trial
court
said
that
--
over
my
objection
sixth
amendment
objections
--
that
she
was
unavailable,
and
allowed
the
transcript
in
pursuant
to
2945.49
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
prior
recorded
testimony
under
such
oath
regarding
preliminary
hearings.
the
defendant
was
convicted.
the
matter
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
where
it
was
reversed
and
remanded.
the
court
adopted
the
honorable
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
barber
v.
page
at
length,
and
said
that
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office
did
not
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
locate
her.
in
fact,
there
were
some
interesting
issues
that
were
not
brought
out.
according
to
counsel
herein,
they
knew
of
her
unavailability
in
november
of
'75.
yet
the
record
--
and
it's
unobjected
to,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
says
it's
allowed
to
issue
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
i
had
raised
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
i
was
successful,
i
dropped
the
statute
--
constitutionality
question,
and
just
went
upon
the
issue
of
barber
v.
page.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
i
did,
sir.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
that's
correct,
i
did
not.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
but
i
would
--
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again,
i
certainly
would
raise
the
issue.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes.
i
have
won
in
two
straight
courts
on
this
issue.
the
unavailability
issue
is
our
second
point
which
we're
going
to
come
to
later.
we
believe
that
there
was
not
a
good
faith
effort
to
locate
her.
mere
absence
from
the
jurisdiction
does
not
make
her
unavailable.
the
mancusi
holding
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
disagree
with
the
late
chief
justice
o'neill
in
that
holding.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
were
about
five
different
areas
in
which
this
could
have
--
in
which
they
could
have
--
in
which
they
could
have
done
more
investigation,
or
done
things
in
and
they
did
nothing,
the
prosecutors'
office.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
no
matter
what
they
said,
they
did
nothing,
absolutely
nothing.
and
they
acknowledged
that.
they
could
have
contacted
the
social
worker.
they
could
have
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
the
area
--
the
issue
was
not
addressed
in
my
brief
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
it
was
only
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
after
being
successful,
i
dropped
the
issue
of
2945.49
being
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
the
issue
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
we
are
here
before
the
court
with
a
statute
which
must
be
presumed
to
be
constitutional,
yes,
although
i
personally
have
other
feelings.
this
is
not
an
issue
is
not
an
issue
at
hand
i
acknowledge
that,
because
i
did
not
raise
it.
the
factual
determination
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
were
different.
i
will
argue
in
a
few
minutes
--
maybe
i
should
argue
it
now
--
that
regardless
of
whether
she
was
available
or
not,
because
of
the
indicia
of
reliability,
the
sixth
amendment
is
such
that
any
recorded
testimony
under
oath
should
not
be
admissible.
i
don't
--
but
our
a
second
argument,
barber
v.
page,
is
that
they
didn't
make
the
good
faith
effort
to
locate
her.
in
the
--
they
didn't
do
anything,
actually.
and
if
they
claimed
they
had
notice
in
november
of
'75
that
she
was
unavailable,
when,
then,
did
they
issue
five
subpoenas,
the
last
of
which
was
in
february
of
'76?
there's
some
confusion
there.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
the
subpoenas
indicate,
according
to
the
record,
that
they
were
served
upon
her.
to
me,
they
had
a
transcript
in
hand,
and
why
bother
doing
anything
more,
since
they
had
the
transcript
in
hand?
and
just
use
the
recorded
transcript
to
convict
the
defendant.
i
think
that
was
the
approach
they
took.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i'm
sorry,
sir,
syllabus
rule?
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
don't
know.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
oh,
yes,
yes,
we
would
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
i
do
believe
we
have
it,
now
that
i
think
about
it.
our
main
premise
is
that
petitioner
failed
to
show
that
anita
isaacs,
the
witness
herein,
was
unavailable
and
--
excuse
me,
strike
that.
let
me
go
to
the
second
argument.
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
of
anita
isaacs
lacked
the
indicia
of
reliability
necessary
for
admission
as
an
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause.
to
put
it
on
a
more
national
frame,
it's
our
position
that
where
a
witness
testifies
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
or
any
prior
recorded
matter,
be
it
an
examining
trial
like
in
texas,
like
a
magistrate's
court
in
some
other
jurisdictions,
or
a
preliminary
hearing
in
ohio,
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution,
the
confrontation
clause,
specifically
precludes
the
use
of
such
recorded
testimony,
notwithstanding
2945.49,
if
the
witness
is
not
cross-examined,
and
even
if
there
is
cross-examination,
if
the
cross-examination
is
brief
and
ineffective,
therefore
lacking
the
indicia
of
reliability.
it's
our
position,
therefore,
that
even
if
this
court,
this
honorable
court,
determines
that
she
was
unavailable,
since
it
was
direct
examination,
since
it
was
not
cross-examination,
since
the
preliminary
hearing
lacked
the
indicia
of
reliability
as
brought
out
in
dutton
v.
evans,
the
preliminary
hearings
testimony,
the
recorded
testimony,
should
not
have
been
admitted
in
the
court
in
the
case
at
bar
below.
we
cite
to
the
court
a
number
of
cases.
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
the
roberts
case
below
talked
about
--
that
the
issues
must
--
at
the
preliminary
hearing-must
be
similar
to
the
issues
at
the
trial
court
they
use
the
words
"similar
enough."
and
we
argue
that
a
preliminary
hearing
is
a
probable
cause
hearing.
they
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed,
and
that
a
defendant
has
committed
it.
while
a
trial
is
certainly
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
as
a
trial
attorney,
the
burdens
are
so
different.
one
is
a
perfunctory
type
of
matter
which
lasts
only
a
few
minutes.
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
counsel
that
the
constitutional
rights
are
not
the
same.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
i
don't
really
know,
timewise,
but
i
would
gather
it
was
less
than
an
hour.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i'm
talking
about
all
the
witnesses.
we
are
fortunate
in
my
county
that
they
do
have
witness
chairs
where
the
witnesses
take
the
stand
and
are
asked
questions
under
oath
in
a
more
formal
standard.
in
some
jurisdictions,
such
as
cogga
county,
ohio,
cleveland
area,
there's
no
--
the
witness
are
all
brought
up
to
the
bench,
and
in
the
middle
of
direct
examination,
the
municipal
judge,
says,
bound
over,
and
that's
it.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
they
certainly
were
not
the
same
counsel.
but
in
green,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
the
witness,
whose
name
was
porter,
was
extensively
cross-examined
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
actually,
in
fact,
porter
was
cross-examined
at
the
trial.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
28?
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes.
the
court
in
green
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
his
name
was
richard
swain.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
no,
no.
he
was
a
then-private
attorney.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
he
was
appointed.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes.
and
then
i
was
subsequently
appointed
as
a
private
attorney.
and
since
that
time
i
became
head
of
the
public
defender's
office.
he
is
now
a
judge
in
the
area.
and
i
certainly
don't
claim
that
there
was
any
ineffectual
counsel
issue
here.
[laughter.]
the
answer
to
the
question
on
green,
green
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
not
like
a
glove,
sir,
because
again
the
indicia
of
reliability,
there
was
extensive
cross-examination
of
the
witness.
and
there
was
not
extensive
cross-examination
--
in
fact,
we
say
there's
no
cross-examination
of
anita
isaacs
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
in
that
part
of
it,
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
they
--
the
court
said
--
i
think
it
was
a
chart
somewhere
in
the
case
where
it
gave
the
comparisons
on
some
things.
and
it
talked
about
the
same
counsel
representing
both
persons
--
both
defendants
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
at
the
trial.
and
we
don't
have
that
here.
i
was
using
that
for
that
one
purpose
only.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
no,
i
don't.
green
argued
substantial
compliance.
but
i
think
green
definitely
did
not
say
that
just
because
there's
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine,
one
has
cross-examination.
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
animals.
and
i
think
that's
--
throughout
all
our
history,
all
the
cases
that
we've
brought
before
this
court,
the
reynolds,
mattox,
motes,
pointer
--
which
is
a
right
of
counsel
case,
barber,
green,
dutton,
mancusi,
the
facts
are
such,
where
there's
either
a
separate
trial,
and
therefore
there's
cross-examination
at
an
earlier
trial,
or
there's
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
do
not
have
any
cross-examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
therefore,
there's
no
indicia
of
reliability.
now,
we
say
that
--
as
counsel
said
--
that
confrontation
is
basically
a
trial
right,
as
cited
in,
i
believe,
barber
v.
page,
'68,
that
confrontation
begins
at
the
time
of
cross-examination.
the
roberts
decision
below,
chief
justice
--
the
late
chief
justice
o'neill
stated
that
--
in
quoting
widmore
on
evidence
--
that
confrontation
and
cross-examination
are
the
same.
we
think
they
can
be
the
same,
not
always
being
the
same.
if
counsel
does
not
do
an
adequate
job
at
a
preliminary
hearing
on
cross-examination,
there
is
no
indicia
of
reliability
therefore,
the
recorded
testimony
should
not
be
admissible
in
the
later
jury
trial
before
the
trial
court.
we
think
the
holdings
of
the
different
courts
are
on
all
fours
on
these
issues.
the
pointer
case
talks
about
complete
and
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
the
barber
case,
of
course,
good
faith
effort.
the
california
case
was
substantial
compliance.
in
not
one
of
these
cases
was
there
a
thing
where
the
defense
attorney
waive
cross-examination
at
a
prelim,
and
then
the
prior
recorded
testimony
was
admissible.
if
we
go
back
to
history,
if
we
go
back
to
mattox,
mattox
v.
u.s.,
i
think
1895,
an
indian
territory
case
on
a
murder
matter,
there
there
was
a
prior
trial.
the
witness
--
witnesses,
two
witnesses,
died.
and
the
testimony
was
admitted
for
the
second
trial.
the
court
said,
although
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
protect
ex
parte
affidavits
or
depositions,
we
allow
it
in
out
of
necessity
and
occasion.
i
would
summarize
that
as
an
interest-in-justice
type
of
argument.
we
would
say
that
where
justice
would
not
be
met
by
now
allowing
it
in,
the
court
would
not
take
that
position.
i
would
differ
with
counsel
in
his
arguments
about
anita
isaacs
being
a
crucial
witness.
she
was
a
very
crucial
witness
to
the
case,
and
therefore
the
dutton
of,
you
know,
crucial
and
devastating
witness
--
there
were
20
witnesses
who
testified
in
dutton
--
is
not
applicable.
we
strongly
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
fact
that
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
probable
cause
hearing,
and
a
jury
trial,
are
two
different,
if
i
may
use
the
term,
animals,
that
one
purpose
is
just,
i
think
as
justice
rehnquist
said
earlier,
is
just
to
determine
probable
cause.
the
strategy
may
be
to
use
minimal
cross-examination.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
in
my
office,
never.
i
don't
appreciate
my
staff
attorneys
waiving
the
preliminary
hearings.
but
many
times
most
court-appointed
attorneys
or
retained
attorneys
will
waive
a
preliminary
hearing,
since
it's
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
a
lot
of
times
it'll
be
done
for
information.
they'll
let
you
talk
to
the
witnesses
outside
the
courtroom
that
have
been
subpoenaed
for
the
trial.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i've
never
waived
cross-examination
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
no.
i've
never
called
witnesses
of
my
own,
except
once
in
awhile
i
see
a
police
officer
outside
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
right.
unless
i
see
a
police
officer
outside
the
courtroom
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
yes.
if
i
see
a
police
officer
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
yes,
i've
been
lucky
a
couple
of
times.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
it's
not
the
usual
rule.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
usually
it's
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
had
one
as
an
assistant
prosecutor
many
years
ago
where
they
pointed
out
somebody
in
the
back
of
the
room
and
not
the
defendant
at
the
trial
table.
so
it
can
happen.
but
as
a
general
rule,
it's
a
perfunctory,
pro
forma
type
of
matter.
so
that
--
but
i
will
call
a
witness
if
i
see
a
police
officer
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
not
called,
i
will
assume
that
he's
not
called
this
officer
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
learn
what
i
can
learn.
i
use
it
as
a
discovery
tool,
which
is
the
argument
i
made
to
the
trial
court,
so
i
can
get
some
information,
since
it's
just
a
probable
cause
hearing.
my
third
argument
later
will
be,
and
i
might
as
well
make
it
now,
my
third
argument
is
that
if
the
court
adopts
the
argument
of
the
petitioner,
and
allows
--
and
states
a
mere
opportunity
to
cross-examine
will
be
sufficient
under
the
confrontation
clause,
it
will
force
trial
attorneys
like
myself
to
ask
for
continuances
so
we
can
investigate
prior
to
having
a
preliminary
hearing,
to
have
lengthy
cross-examinations,
to
bring
in
our
own
witnesses,
because
we
want
to
make
sure
the
record
is
well-protected.
when
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
the
7th
of
january,
and
trial
on
the
10th
of
january,
it's
highly
unlikely
that
his
then
appointed
counsel
even
barely
got
to
know
him,
or
see
him
in
the
jail.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
i
might
not
bring
in
my
own
witnesses.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
because
then
there
testimony
--
well,
it
depends.
if
i
think
there's
a
witness
that
might
be
favorable,
and
the
state
has
not
had
a
chance
to
prepare
these
witnesses
for
the
trial,
even
though
they're
state's
witnesses,
i
may
call
them
to
the
stand
and
put
their
testimony
under
oath,
so
later
on,
months
later,
they
cannot
take
a
different
approach.
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
no,
i
would
never
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
correct,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
because
you're
putting
your
own
witness
under
oath
at
a
prior
recorded
testimony,
and
they
cannot
change
--
not
that
we
would
have
them
change
their
testimony
don't
get
me
wrong.
i'm
certainly
not
insinuating
that.
it's
just
that
at
that
point,
we
don't
really
have
time
to
investigate
to
determine
the
full
matter.
initially,
a
lot
of
cases
will
look
very
good
to
the
defense.
and
then
as
we
get
into
them
more
and
more,
it
turns
out
that
may
have
seven
or
eight
different
witnesses
that
point
the
guy
out
as
the
one
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
so
our
second
argument
was
that
this
would
create
havoc
in
the
municipal
courts.
it
would
require,
maybe,
half-day,
all
day
preliminary
hearings
or
if
the
court
only
adopted
his
rule
in
part,
it
might
force
us
to
waive
cross-examination
on
some
cases
rather
than
dare
even
cross-examine
for
fear
of
having
the
compliance
with
the
sixth
amendment.
but
most
likely
it
would
cause
extensive
prelims.
it
would
cause
continuances
so
we
can
do
investigations.
and
the
municipal
courts
are
not
geared
for
that.
nor
would
the
judges
in
the
municipal
court
tolerate
that.
i
think
the
third
argument
that
we
have,
which
was
addressed
briefly,
was
the
unavailability.
i'm
not
going
to
address
that.
i'm
just
going
to
say
that
under
barber
v.
page,
it
is
our
believe
that
in
justice
marshall
there
was
not
a
good
faith
effort
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
show
that
this
witness
was
unavailable,
and
they
attempted
to
locate
her.
they
had
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript,
and
they
used
the
mancusi
philosophy,
"just
because
we
have
a
prelim
transcript,
let's
bring
it
into
evidence."
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
i
believe
this
court
has
the
authority
to
review
the
matters
and
make
its
own
determination.
it's
not
bound
by
the
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
the
court
below
them
said
otherwise.
and
so
we
have
two
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
i
don't
know,
sir,
i
--
mr.
marvin
r.
plasco
well,
i
would
give
it
more
weight
than
a
law
review
article.
but
i
think
this
honorable
court,
the
court
of
last
resort,
has
the
authority
to
look
into
the
matter
and
to
make
its
own
determination.
but
even
if
she
is
unavailable,
which
we
differ
on,
and
we
did
not
cross-petition
on
it,
and
i
acknowledge
that,
we're
arguing
strenuously
that
the
sixth
amendment
still
precludes
prior
recorded
testimony
where
there's
no
indicia
of
reliability,
hence,
no
cross-examination,
or
where
cross-examination
is
ineffectual.
the
ohio
supreme
court,
after
deciding
roberts,
decided
state
v.
smith,
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
and
i
think
in
petitioner's
brief.
there,
they
felt
in
a
rape
case
that
the
cross-examination
was
so
ineffectual
that
there
was
no
indicia
of
reliability.
they
didn't
use
the
words,
"indicia
of
reliability,"
but
again,
there
was
nothing
there
for
them
to
introduce
it
at
trial.
therefore,
it
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
we
would
ask
this
honorable
court
to
affirm
the
decisions
of
both
the
eleventh
appellate
district
and
the
ohio
supreme
court.
