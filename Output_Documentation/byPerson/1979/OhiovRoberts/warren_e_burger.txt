chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-756,
ohio
against
roberts.
mr.
shoop,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
called
the
witness
that's
in
question
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unavailable
in
the
sense,
ultimately,
that
she
wasn't
there,
or
unavailable
in
the
traditional
sense?
how
do
you
read
the
language
of
the
court
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
ohio
law
--
going
back
now
to
the
preliminary
hearing
--
under
ohio
law
is
it
required
that
the
person
have
been
subjected
to
cross-examination,
or
simply
that
the
witness
was
available
for
cross-examination
by
the
adverse
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
ohio
courts
put
some
gloss
on
the
good-faith
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
relying
on
the
ancient
maxim
that
people
aren't
required
to
do
what
is
fruitless
and
pointless?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
chief
justice
o'neill's
opinion
states,
"therefore
the
trial
judge
could
properly
hold
that
the
witness
was
unavailable
to
testify
in
person."
that
ties
right
in
with
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
asking
you.
and
your
argument
is
that
in
the
face
of
that
paragraph,
of
which
i
read
only
the
last
sentence,
there
was
no
need
to
show
any
efforts
that
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
demonstrated
that
it
would
have
done
no
good
to
telephone
california
or
the
social
worker
or
anyone
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
plasco?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
ohio
supreme
court's
statement
in
the
opinion
from
the
facts
which
you
have
recited
and
which
the
judge
digested,
that
the
trial
judge
could
reasonably
infer
that
anita
had
left
san
francisco,
and
that
it
would
have
been
fruitless
for
the
prosecutor
to
contact
the
san
francisco
social
worker
in
order
to
locate
her?
therefore,
the
trial
judge
could
properly
hold
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know
you
disagree
with
it.
but
what
more
do
you
have
to
say
about
it
than
that
you
disagree
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here's
--
this
holding
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
tells
us,
does
it
not,
the
statute
is
constitutional,
in
one
sense,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
are
we
not
confronted
with
a
statute
held
constitutional
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
which
had
authority
to
pass
on
it,
and
a
further
factual
determination
that
it
would
have
been
fruitless
for
them
to
do
any
of
the
things
which
you
now
complain
they
did
not
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
to
anticipate
the
argument
that
you're
now
making
that
they
didn't
do
anything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
how
long
this
preliminary
hearing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
more
than
a
few
minutes,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
your
ohio
syllabus
rule
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think,
referred
to,
what
are
we
to
do
with
respect
to
the
opinion
written
by
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
court?
just
ignore
it
as
though
it
had
never
been
written?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
status
of
the
statement
in
the
opinion
that
it
would
have
been
a
waste
of
time
for
the
state
to
try
to
pursue
this
witness,
to
find
this
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
last
word
we
have
is
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
if
that
is
the
last
word
under
the
syllabus
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
it
just
a
law
review
article,
like
a
law
review
article?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen
--
i
guess
you
have
a
couple
of
minutes,
don't
you?
excuse
me,
mr.
shoop.
yes,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
one
paragraph?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
