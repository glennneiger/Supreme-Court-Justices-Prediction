on
that
issue,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
was
unanimous,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
all
agree
he
was
unavailable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
shoop,
may
i
ask
a
question
on
availability.
do
you
read
the
state
court's
opinion
to
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
witness
was
unavailable
and
--
which
is
what
it
seems
to
say
it
relies
on
the
statute.
and
then
my
second
question
--
i
put
them
both
to
you
at
the
same
time
--
is
there
also
a
federal
requirement
of
unavailability,
and
did
the
court
find
that
that
requirement
was
met?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
the
first
counsel
had
been
someone
else
in
your
office,
would
green
fit
this
case
like
a
glove?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
your
quotation
on
page
28
is
a
correct
one,
there
is
no
reliance
there
that
i
see
on
the
extensiveness
of
the
cross-examination.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
think
that
the
court
was
merely
emphasizing,
stressing,
everything
that
was
present
to
support
its
conclusion,
and
that
it
would
reach
the
same
conclusion
whether
or
not
number
two
were
there?
you
don't
think
so?
