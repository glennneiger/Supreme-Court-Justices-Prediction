justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
couldn't
have
objected,
the
other
side
couldn't
have
objected,
could
he
have?
hadn't
ohio
abolished
the
voucher
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
challenging
here,
mr.
shoop,
the
finding
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
generally
for
you
in
result.
but
as
i
read
justice
o'neill's
opinion,
he
found
quite
clearly
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
are
you
challenging
that
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
really
could
hardly
argue
otherwise,
could
you,
in
light
of
page
19
of
the
petition,
the
blue
volume,
where
it
says,
chief
justice
--
the
late
chief
justice
o'neill
as
saying,
at
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph,
"in
the
instant
cause
the
appellee
argues
that
the
state
failed
to
show
a
good-faith
effort
to
produce
the
witness
in
person,
as
required
by
the
rule
in
barber.
and
of
course
barber
is
a
case
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
page
11
of
the
transcript,
where
the
question
is
oh,
you
talked
to
your
daughter,
and
is
that
the
last
time
you
talked
to
her
and
the
answer
is,
no,
she
called
again
later
in
the
summer.
we
don't
know
where
she
called
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
frequently,
counsel,
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
your
defense
lawyer's
best
tactic
is
to
keep
his
mouth
shut,
because
all
the
prosecution
has
to
produce
is
a
probable
cause
to
bind
over.
i
take
it
here
the
defense
lawyer
went
further
and
called
a
witness
of
his
own?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
this
particular
witness.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
pretty
much
of
a
tactical
judgment,
isn't
it,
on
the
part
of
a
defense
lawyer
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
whether
you
call
any
witness
or
not,
and
if
you
call
anyone,
how
much
you
ask
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it's
not
cross-examination,
but
when
he
saw
she
was
beginning
to
crawfish
on
him,
so
to
speak,
he
began
asking
her
adverse
questions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
when
the
leads
weren't
followed,
he
began
asking
really
genuinely
hostile
questions,
the
way
you
would
on
cross-examination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
mean
an
extended
thing.
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
questions
that
you
would
ask
of
your
own
witness
whom
you
were
assured
was
going
to
answer
the
questions
the
way
you
thought
the
person
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
didn't
--
you
had
a
clear
holding
from
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
that
the
showing
of
unavailability
was
insufficient.
and
yet
you
didn't
cross-petition
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
judgment
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
didn't
even
argue
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
on
the
unavailability
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
--
you
didn't
petition
for
certiorari
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
plasco?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
28
of
your
brief,
you
have
a
quotation
from
green
v.
california,
an
opinion
offered
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
white,
where
you
set
forth
four
elements.
there
is
no
specific
citation
to
california
v.
green,
to
the
--
no
page
citation
to
it.
and
the
opinion
has
several
concurrences.
and
i
simply
have
not
had
time
to
check
it
through
page
by
page.
i
simply
don't
find
the
specific
language,
one,
two
three,
four,
that
you
set
out
and
underscore
in
your
--
although
you
do
say
--
put
an
"emphasis
supplied."
but
are
you
confident
that's
in
the
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
talking
about
page
28
of
the
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
require
you
to
bring
in
your
own
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
talking
about
a
very,
very
rare
type
of
case
where
it's
not
your
witness
that
you're
calling
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
a
state's
witness
that
the
state
is
not
calling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
too.
