it
could
be
both,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"their
own
curriculum,"
you
mean
the
curriculum
that
the
faculty
teaches
the
students,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
come,
one
thing
that
struck
me
about
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
the
frequency
with
which
it
noted
that
the
administration
simply
went
along
with
the
faculty.
there
appeared
to
be
an
absence
of
the
tensions
to
which
you
referred
which
occurred
in
ordinary
industrial
situations.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
tell
me,
give
me
an
example
that
you
can
find
in
this
record
of
this
faculty
operating
in
its
own
interest
rather
than
of
the
employer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
place
i
can
read
in
the
record
the
evidence
to
support
the
board's
conclusion
that
the
faculty
operated
in
its
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
in
your
brief
give
record
cites
in
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frankel,
didn't
this
court
in
pittsburgh
steamship
company
say
that
we
don't
sit
in
the
same
posture
in
reviewing
the
board's
findings
as
the
court
of
appeals
does,
that
we
must
give
certain
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
one
court
of
appeals
might
find
one
way
and
one
might
find
another
and
each
might
be
upheld
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frankel,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
board
could
correctly
reach
one
result
with
respect
to
columbia
university
and
another
result
with
respect
to
a
law
school
which
is
the
seventh
proprietary
school
in
a
large
metropolitan
area
where
each
faculty
member
simply
comes
in
and
bargains
with
the
president
over
what
his
salary
is
going
to
do,
and
there
aren't
any
faculty
committees
to
recommend
anything?
