mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
joining
the
argument
of
my
colleague,
mr.
come,
i
state
the
issue
of
this
case
as
to
whether
the
nature
of
the
authority
of
the
faculty
may
exercise
warrants
their
exclusion
under
the
act.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated,
it
is
indeed
a
procrustean
problem
in
the
application
of
the
statute,
but
it's
a
problem
whose
solution
goes
to
an
understanding
of
what
the
supervisory
and
managerial
exclusions
are
based
upon,
and
that
is
in
the
legislative
history
the
repeated
statement
of
the
congress
to
protect
the
employers
from
the
conflict
of
loyalty
of
those
representatives
who
should
be
loyal
first
to
management
and
secondly
to
maintain
a
balance
of
power
in
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
those
employees
in
bargaining
with
the
employer
and
its
management
representatives.
in
this
respect,
i
should
note,
again
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
when
congress
acted
in
1974
in
amending
the
statute
with
the
health
care
amendments,
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
decided
in
1971
and
in
1972
the
adelphi
decision
and
the
c.
w.
post
decision
which
first
dealt
with
the
inclusion
of
faculty
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
fact,
as
our
brief
indicates,
these
cases
were
brought
up
before
the
congressional
committees
and
before
the
congress
in
their
consideration
of
that
legislation.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
would
believe
so.
they
both
are
institutions
with
full
educational
programs,
with
graduate
schools
in
place,
chartered
by
the
state
of
new
york,
four-year
programs
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
no,
they
are
not.
they
are
not
for
profit
chartered
institutions
also
in
the
state
of
new
york,
i
might
note.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
think
that
is
the
single
critical
inquiry
here.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
think
in
answer
to
that
question,
it
requires
a
distinction
between
their
influence
rather
than
their
authority
and
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
last
point
in
our
brief
we
make
repeated
references
thereto.
one
example
would
be
the
recommendations
of
the
faculty
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
promotion
or
even
hiring
of
other
colleagues,
whether
a
victorian
rather
than
elizabethan
english
historian
might
be
appropriate,
whether
one
might
be
more
appropriate
than
the
other.
what
is
shown
in
this
record
is
notwithstanding
such
recommendations
of
promotions,
of
tenure,
even
of
hiring.
the
university
administration,
without
input
from
the
faculty,
froze
promotions.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
think
they
are
in
the
interests
of
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
believe
so,
and
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
pursuit
of
their
own
professional
excellence.
it
is
within
their
professional
competence,
within
their
professional
domain
to
make
at
least
judgments
as
to
whether
their
department
might
be
improved,
their
department
might
be
furthered
by
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
no.
the
fact
that
their
interests
does
not
solve
the
issue.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
it
would
be
true
with
the
lawyer,
doctor
or
faculty
member,
with
any
professional
who
must
make
a
decision
about
how
to
treat
a
patient,
who
to
appeal
a
case,
how
to
teach
a
course.
they
all
comport
with
the
interests
of
their
employers,
but
then
is
the
effect
of
this
case
to
say
that
no
professional,
because
of
the
nature
of
decisions
he
may
make
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
they
do
not
have
any
effective
authority,
that
they
do
not
possess
the
responsibility
and
authority.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
understand.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
they
would
act
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
if
they
possess
the
authority,
your
honor,
i
must
respectfully
differ.
i
believe
that
that
would
then
become
the
question.
they
do
possess
the
authority
with
respect
to
authority
and
they
do
act
in
the
interests
of
the
employer.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all.
i
am
saying
there
is
often
a
correspondence
between
their
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
university
and
that
they
act
in
both
interests,
but
their
action
does
not
possess
the
authority
as
to
render
them
either
supervisors
or
managers
and
that
is
what
this
record
shows
completely
and
what
i
believe
that
the
circuit
court
overlooked,
and
that
is
where
their
actions,
precisely
in
the
area
you
referred
to,
mr.
justice,
have
only
authority
insofar
as
the
university
chooses
to
defer
to
them.
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
as
i
indicated,
in
promotions
or
tenure
decisions,
the
university
will
freeze
the
authority
for
those.
in
the
non-renewal
of
a
faculty
member,
when
it
goes
to
a
grievance
committee
of
faculty,
they
make
a
judgment
and
then
say
we
have
no
authority
to
resolve
this
matter
and
refer
it
to
their
president
and
to
their
dean.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
only
the
president,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
that
is
correct,
with
an
independent
review
by
the
vice
president
for
academic
affairs
after
interviewing
by
the
dean
and
often
in
some
cases
at
least
with
some
origination
from
the
faculty.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
certain
faculty
or
faculty
committees
have
not
considered
or
acted
on
each
person
appointed
by
the
president.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
the
tenure
decision
is
made
by
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
there
are
cases
in
the
record
here
that
show
that
certain
faculty
who
were
recommended
for
tenure
were
never
considered
by
the
board
of
trustees
or
the
president
because
the
dean
refused
to
pass
up
the
recommendation
under
his
own
choice.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
the
standards
that
the
faculty
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
that
is
correct,
but
the
faculty's
interest
in
those
cases
would
be
really
again
within
precisely
their
professional
expertise
and
competence,
not
in
the
expertise
of
managerial
and
--
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
that
is
correct
here,
but
the
authority
here
is
instead
based
on
again
an
understanding
of
the
professional
identity
and
the
protection
they
are
afforded,
the
coverage
under
the
act
they
are
afforded
as
professional
employees.
thus
it
is
the
faculty
who
can
tell
their
dean
that
--
that
can
best
tell
their
dean
about
the
publications
and
the
writings
of
their
colleagues,
and
even
in
some
respects
the
performance
in
the
classroom.
but
in
each
case
it
will
then
be
the
dean,
it
will
then
be
the
senior
vice
president
of
this
institution
who
independently
reviews
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
might
warrant
or
not
a
promotion
or
a
tenure
or
any
other
personnel
decision
with
particular
view
to
institutional
priorities
and
needs
about
which
the
faculty
cannot
speak
and
about
which
they
do
not
address.
mr.
ronald
h.
shechtman
thank
you.
