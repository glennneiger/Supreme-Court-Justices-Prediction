mr.
come,
does
it
vary
somewhat
among
the
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
each
faculty
member
with
respect
to
his
own
course
and
his
own
students?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
alone
didn't
make
them
managerial.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
real
difficulty
in
this
case
is
more
fundamental,
isn't
it,
mr.
come?
it
is
the
difficulty
that
is
reflected
by
the
rather
procrustean
effort
of
transferring
the
application
of
this
statute,
which
is
tailored
to
meet
the
paradigm
industrial
or
commercial
setting
to
an
academic
institution.
that
is
the
basic
problem
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
is
the
difficult
problem,
the
fundamental
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
originally
a
college,
as
the
latin
word
implies,
collegium,
was
a
collection
of
scholars
who
went
to
oxford
or
cambridge
or
bologna
or
heidelberg
or
paris
and
scholars
then
came
--
students
then
came
to
learn
from
them
and
the
faculty
were
the
university,
they
were
the
college,
that
was
it.
justice
potter
stewart
one
way,
upwards
or
downwards,
but
i
agree
that
it
has
come
a
long
way.
justice
potter
stewart
we
may
both
agree
that
the
present-day
university
is
not
like
kings
college
in
cambridge
originally
was,
but
can't
we
also
agree
that
yeshiva
university
is
not
like
general
motors
either?
justice
potter
stewart
or
chrysler.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
assertion
of
jurisdiction
had
to
do
with
people
who
were
concededly
employees,
janitors
and
the
like,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cornell
case,
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
have
to
do
with
faculty.
justice
potter
stewart
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
in
this
case
does
the
bargaining
unit
include
department
heads?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
still
be
open?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bargaining
unit
did
not
include
deans,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
deans
generally
are
elected
by
their
colleagues,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
or
i
suppose
they
are
appointed
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
recommendation
of
the
faculty.
justice
potter
stewart
did
both
of
those
cases
involve
what
are
now
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
mature
universities?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
weren't
proprietary
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
president
has
ever
hired
anyone
without
the
approval
of
the
faculty
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
granting
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
only
on
the
recommendation
of
the
faculty?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
frankel,
before
you
do,
the
board
did
make
that
finding
about
this
university
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
said
those
words?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
will
let
me
call
it
a
finding
just
for
a
moment,
i
will
go
ahead.
whatever
they
said
and
whatever
it
is,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
it.
so
the
court
of
appeals
turned
over
the
board,
and
the
board
brought
the
case
here,
we
took
it,
what
is
our
posture
here?
do
we
sit
as
a
court
of
appeals
or
does
the
court
of
appeals
--
or
do
we
have
to
respect
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
in
your
favor?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
what
universal
camera
stands
for
to
some
extent
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
what
cases
since
then
have
said?
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
just
get
that
a
little
more
precisely
because
i
am
interested
in
what
is
fact
and
what
is
law
here.
i
take
it
it
is
fact
whether
the
faculty
recommends,
say,
a
new
person
to
be
given
tenure.
but
are
you
saying
it
is
a
question
of
law
as
to
whose
interests
is
served
by
what
recommendation?
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
squarely
say
we
find
that
the
faculty's
own
interest
was
served
on
page
68a
that
you
called
our
attention
to.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
they
made
a
recommendation
on
the
salaries
to
be
paid
to
starting
professors,
would
that
be
in
their
interest
or
in
the
university's
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
starting
professor's
salary
level
would
have
an
impact
on
their
own
though.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
