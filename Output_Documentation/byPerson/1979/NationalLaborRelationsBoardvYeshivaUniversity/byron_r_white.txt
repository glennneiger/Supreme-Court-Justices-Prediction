mr.
shechtman,
i
take
it
that
the
board
thought
it
critical
to
find
that
the
faculty
operated
in
its
own
interests
rather
than
that
of
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
about
to
get
to
that,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
quite
responsive
to
my
question.
are
you
asserting
that
the
faculty's
recommendations
about
hiring
new
personnel
are
in
the
interests
of
the
faculty
rather
than
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
is
the
critical
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
not
the
interest
of
the
university,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
university
hires
somebody
to
make
recommendations
to
it,
isn't
the
faculty
charged
with
making
recommendations
in
the
interests
of
the
university?
wouldn't
that
be
a
job
description
of
some
faculty
committee?
it
wouldn't
say
please
act
in
your
own
selfish
interests
and
not
in
the
interests
of
the
university,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
interested
in
lawyers
or
doctors,
i
am
interested
in
these
professors.
are
you
saying
that
making
recommendations
for
hiring
that
they
are
not
acting
in
the
interests
of
the
university?
and
if
they
aren't,
are
they
breaching
their
--
are
they
outside
their
mission?
justice
byron
r.
white
surely,
i
can't
believe
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
that
these
committees
are
free
to
disregard
in
making
the
recommendations,
are
expected
to
disregard
the
interests
of
the
university.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
completely
different
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
stick
to
the
point
we
are
talking
about,
whether
they
act
in
their
interests
or
that
of
the
university
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
the
critical
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
make
recommendations.
now,
do
you
--
are
you
telling
me
that
their
job
--
that
the
university
freely
lets
them
or
does
not
instruct
them
to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
university?
instead,
they
consistently
take
recommendations
and
have
committees
even
though
consistently
they
disregard
the
interests
of
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
frankel,
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
the
university
would
so
regularly
follow
faculty
recommendations
if
it
thought
the
faculty
was
acting
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
university.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
concluded
that
the
faculty
operated
in
its
own
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
agree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
did,
i
take
it
if
you
were
right,
the
board
would
conclude
otherwise,
its
bottom
line
would
be
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
board
agreed
with
you
that
the
faculty
does
indeed
act
on
behalf
of
the
university,
it
would
not
hold
the
faculty
to
be
employees
rather
than
managers?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
universal
camera
say
unless
we
can
fit
it
into
one
of
two
exceptions
of
the
universal
camera
principle,
we
can't
go
beyond
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
includes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
was
a
finding
of
fact
for
the
board
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
board's
conclusion
that
the
faculty
acts
in
its
own
interests
rather
than
the
university,
would
that
be
a
finding
subject
to
the
substantial
evidence
test?
