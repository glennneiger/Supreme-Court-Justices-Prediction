mr.
come,
in
an
industrial
setting
do
they
let
them
have
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
their
supervisors?
chief

warren
e.
burger
when
congress
passed
this
legislation,
do
you
think
they
gave
any
thought
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
faculty
members
of
a
college
were
to
be
included
is
there
any
evidence
that
congress
thought
about
it
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
aren't
you
asking
us
to
decide
what
congress
would
have
thought
about
it
if
they
had
given
it
any
thought
one
way
or
the
other?

warren
e.

are
you
saying,
mr.
frankel,
that
this
is
a
matter
of
whether
the
court
simply
drew
different
legal
conclusions
from
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
board,
different

mr.
frankel,
going
back
to
the
university
of
bologna,
about
a
thousand
years
ago,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
what
was
good
for
the
faculty
was
good
for
the
university
and
vice
versa?
was
that
the
tradition
of
that
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
consistent
with
the
idea
that
the
university
is
the
faculty,
isn't
it?

is
good
for
the

the
question
that
i
tossed
to
mr.
frankel?
chief

if
it
doubled
their
salaries,
it
might
not
be.
