well,
certainly
in
making
tenure
recommendations,
the
university
must
have
some
standards
and
expects
the
faculty
to
live
up
to
the
university
standards
rather
than
to
serve
the
faculty's
own
parochial
interests.

is
that
right
or
not?

furthermore,
even
if
the
faculty
doesn't
have
authority
and
even
if
the
president
has
the
final
authority,
that
is
true
in
the
industrial
establishment,
foremen
and
admitted
supervisors
often
don't
have
final
authority.
their
bosses
can
overrule
them
at
the
drop
of
a
hat.
