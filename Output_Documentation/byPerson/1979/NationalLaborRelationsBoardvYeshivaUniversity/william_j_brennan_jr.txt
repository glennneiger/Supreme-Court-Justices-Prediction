justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
frankel,
in
our
review
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
did
in
this
case,
does
the
statement
in
universal
camera
have
any
application,
whether
on
the
record
as
a
whole
as
substantial
evidence
as
to
support
agency
findings
on
the
question
which
congress
has
placed
in
the
keeping
of
the
courts
of
appeal?
this
court
will
intervene
only
in
what
ought
to
be
the
rare
instance
when
the
standard
appears
to
have
been
misapprehended
or
grossly
misapplied,
does
that
have
any
relevance
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
was
thinking
wasn't
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
misapplied
universal
camera.
my
question
was
addressed
to
whether
that
limitation
upon
our
review,
namely
when
the
standard
appears
to
have
misapprehended
or
grossly
misapplied
since
what
the
second
circuit
did
was
refuse
to
enforce
the
board's
conclusion,
whether
that
universal
camera
principle
limits
our
review
in
this
case.
