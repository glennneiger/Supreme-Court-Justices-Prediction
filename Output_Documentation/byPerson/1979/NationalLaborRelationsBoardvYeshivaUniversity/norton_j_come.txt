mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
in
the
board's
order
requiring
yeshiva
university
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
yeshiva
university
faculty
association
which
following
a
board
election
had
been
certified
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
university's
full-time
faculty
members.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
university's
faculty
members
who
participate
in
decision-making
regarding
the
hiring,
termination
and
promotion
of
faculty
and
the
academic
standards
of
the
university
are
managerial
or
supervisory
employees
and
thus
exempt
from
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
or
merely
professional
employees
who
are
protected
by
the
act,
as
the
board
held.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
could
be
both,
and
that
is
why
i
said
merely.
there
is
no
question
that
the
faculty
are
professional
employees.
the
question
is
whether
they
are
also
managerial.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeshiva
university
is
a
private
educational
institution
chartered
by
the
state
of
new
york,
facilities
located
on
four
campuses
in
new
york
city,
has
approximately
2,500
full
and
part-time
students
that
attend
schools
involved
in
this
proceeding,
and
those
schools
have
approximately
209
full-time
and
150
part-time
faculty
members.
the
ultimate
policy
and
decision-making
body
is
the
board
of
trustees
on
which
no
faculty
members
sit.
the
university
president,
who
is
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
university,
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
trustees.
the
next
stratum
of
the
administration
consists
of
the
vice
presidents
for
academic
affairs,
business
affairs
and
student
affairs.
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
each
of
the
schools
is
the
dean
or
director
who
serves
as
the
liaison
officer
between
the
programmatic
activities
of
the
school
and
the
central
administration
and
reports
and
is
responsible
to
the
academic
vice
president
and
the
president.
and
there
is
an
executive
council
of
the
university
whose
members
are
appointed
by
the
president,
with
the
concurrence
of
the
board
of
trustees,
which
consists
of
the
deans
of
the
various
schools
and
the
directors
of
the
various
administrative
divisions
of
the
university.
the
administration
also
has
various
committees,
including
a
budget
committee
which
is
appointed
by
the
president
and
consists
of
the
vice
president
for
business
affairs,
the
registrar
and
the
dean
of
one
of
the
colleges.
the
budget
committee
establishes
guidelines
which
are
followed
by
the
deans
and
directors
of
the
various
schools
in
drafting
their
budgets.
the
draft
budgets
are
then
submitted
to
the
vice
president
for
business
affairs
who
reviews
them
with
the
budget
committee
and
then
submits
them
to
the
president.
now,
paralleling
this
administrative
or
bureaucratic
structure
is
a
structure
of
faculty
committees,
councils
and
assemblies
which
enables
the
faculty
members
to
share
in
the
governments
of
the
university.
thus
the
faculty
members
of
the
various
schools
exercise
considerable
discretion
in
determining
their
own
curriculum,
the
grading
system,
admission
and
matriculation
standards,
and
course
schedules.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
does
vary
to
some
extent,
but
in
general
this
is
the
picture
and
the
picture
that
the
board
found
is
typical
of
most
other
universities
and
colleges.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
they
also
make
recommendations
--talking
about
the
faculty
now
--
which
are
often
accepted,
regarding
the
hiring,
reappointment
and
termination,
promotion
and
tenure
of
other
faculty
members.
now,
the
court
below
acknowledged
that,
as
i
said
before,
university
faculty
members
were
professional
employees
within
the
meaning
of
221
of
the
act
and
as
an
incident
of
that
professionalism
they
could
determine
the
contents
of
the
course
and
the
methods
of
teaching
it
and
the
evaluation
of
the
students'
academic
performance.
the
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
did
not.
but
in
the
court's
view,
when
the
faculty
members
go
beyond
that,
as
they
did
here,
and
exercised
the
additional
powers
that
i
have
alluded
to,
they
were
no
longer
simply
exercising
professional
expertise
but
really
were
substantially
and
pervasively
operating
the
enterprise.
now,
we
submit
that
the
court
below
failed
adequately
to
analyze
the
basis
for
the
act's
exclusion
of
managerial
and
supervisory
employees
and
to
distinguish
between
the
faculty's
influence
over
matters
of
professional
concern
and
its
actual
formal
bureaucratic
authority.
supervisors,
as
this
court
is
aware,
are
exempt
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
they
are
defined
as
persons
who
exercise
authority
over
employees
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
the
senate
report
refers
to
them
as
persons
who
are
traditionally
regarded
as
part
of
management
as
opposed
to
rank
and
file
employees.
similarly,
managerial
employees,
as
this
court
held
in
aerospace
several
years
ago,
likewise
are
exempt
from
the
act
and
they
are
defined
as
executives
who
formulate
and
effectuate
management
policies
by
expressing
and
making
operative
the
decisions
of
their
employer.
like
supervisors,
managerial
employees
are
recognized
by
their
alliance
with
management
as
opposed
to
the
rank
and
file
employees.
now,
at
the
same
time
that
it
exempted
supervisory
and
managerial
employees,
congress
continued
the
coverage
of
professional
employees
who
are
defined
in
section
212
of
the
act
as
those
who
exercise
discretion
and
judgment
in
the
exercise
of
their
work.
and
although
many
professional
employees
are
asked
for
their
advice
on
many
important
policy
questions,
they
do
not
become
managerial
employees
merely
because
their
advice
has
an
important
influence
on
the
conduct,
the
ultimate
conduct
of
the
enterprise
or
the
institution.
it
is
necessary
to
show,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
bell
aerospace
opinion,
that
professional
employees
were
acting
as
representatives
of
management
and
implementing
management
policies.
and
the
reason
for
this
requirement
is
that
there
is
attention
in
the
act
between
the
exclusion
of
managerial
and
supervisory
employees
and
the
inclusion
of
professionals,
and
you
have
to
accommodate
them,
the
two
in
such
a
way
that
one
does
not
engulf
the
other.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
presents
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
presents
a
problem.
however,
the
principle
that
the
board
has
applied
here
is
a
principle
that
is
well
ingrained
in
the
statute
and
is
applicable
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
about
that.
however,
we
submit
that
the
modern
university
and
college
has
come
a
long
way
from
the
universal
model,
and
that
we
submit
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
is
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
focused
simply
upon
what
went
on
in
the
individual
colleges
and
neglected
or
at
least
it
didn't
pay
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
parallel
and
elaborate
administrative
structure
of
this
university
which
is
typical
of
most
other
universities
and
colleges
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
not
like
general
motors.
in
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
or
chrysler
--
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
is
so
good.
in
any
event,
in
the
typical
industrial
plant
you
have
what
is
known
as
a
hierarchical
arrangement
and
it's
very
easy
to
spot
supervisory
and
managerial
employees
from
where
they
stand
in
the
hierarchy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
helps
but
the
title,
of
course,
is
not
necessarily
decisive.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
unusual
to
at
least
get
recommendations.
the
administration
doesn't
have
to
follow
it,
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
get
someone
as
a
supervisor
who,
assuming
that
he
is
capable
of
doing
the
job
from
the
management's
standpoint,
can
work
in
harmony
with
the
rank
and
file,
and
i
would
say
it
is
good
industrial
relations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
certainly
at
the
time
they
passed
the
wagner
act,
probably
not.
i
think
there
was
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
extent
of
coverage
under
the
commerce
clause
and
whether
a
college
or
university
could
meet
the
definition
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
not
an
unfamiliar
problem
in
statutory
interpretation
that
this
court
has
to
face.
the
jurisdictional
breadth
of
the
statute
is
very
broad.
the
exemptions
are
very
limited
and
they
do
not
exclude
colleges
and
universities,
but
it
is
not
even
that
hard
because
in
1974,
when
congress
amended
the
statute
to
take
out
the
exemption
for
nonprofit
hospitals,
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
congress
did
that
was
that
it
found
that
there
was
no
justification
for
continuing
to
exclude
that
limited
category
of
nonprofit
institutions
and
they
took
note
of
the
fact
that
the
board
had
over
the
years
as
a
result
of
the
increased
impact
of
colleges
and
universities
on
interstate
commerce,
had
been
asserting
jurisdiction
over
colleges
and
universities.
so
i
think
that
we
do
have
indication
here
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
board
had
been
interpreting
the
act
to
apply
to
colleges
and
universities
and
was
asserting
jurisdiction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
is
right,
librarians
and
maintenance
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
cornell
case.
the
first
faculty
case
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
did
not
have
to
do
with
faculty.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
bargaining
unit
did
include
department
heads.
and
i
should
say
that
the
board
has
included
department
heads
in
some
universities
and
not
in
others,
depending
upon
the
facts
of
the
extent
of
their
alignment
with
management.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
question,
so
presumably
if
we
were
to
prevail
on
the
basic
faculty
question,
that
would
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
however,
that
issue
is
involved
in
the
boston
university
case
which
is
pending
on
certiorari.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
include
deans.
the
board
has
consistently
found
that
deans
were
aligned
with
management
and
excluded
as
such.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
are
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
are
appointed
by
the
president.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
administration
chooses
to
accord
great
deference
and
respect
to
the
judgment
of
its
faculty
does
not
indicate
that
the
faculty
is
acting
as
management
representatives
when
they
give
their
advice.
they
have
the
expertise
in
this
area
and
the
administration
for
that
reason
chooses
to
seek
their
advice.
but
by
the
same
token,
since
in
our
submission
the
faculty
are
not
accountable
to
the
administration
for
the
worth
of
their
recommendations
on
these
faculty
government
questions,
unlike
their
performance
as
teachers
or
scholars,
the
administration
is
free
to
disregard
those
recommendations
and
that
to
us
is
the
heart
of
the
reason
why
they
are
not
managerial
employees
when
they
exercise
their
government's
functions.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
concept
in
the
interest
of
the
university.
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
a
legal
conclusion
by
the
board
which
means
not
that
the
faculty
is
necessarily
opposed
to
the
interests
of
the
university
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconceived
the
legal
significance
of
that
term.
in
the
interests
of
the
employer,
as
the
board
used
it
there,
means
whether
or
not
the
faculty
was
furthering
management
policies
when
it
was
making
its
judgments
on
these
matters.
the
faculty,
to
restate
the
obvious,
is
principally
engaged
in
teaching,
research
and
writing.
those
are
the
things
on
which
it
is
judged
for
promotion,
as
is
indicated
by
the
ferkauf
guidelines
which
are
in
the
record
here
at
pages
1441
and
1447.
now,
in
its
collective
professional
functions,
there
is
of
course
a
very
substantial
overlap
between
th
faculty's
own
interests
and
the
university's,
but
it
make
a
judgment
in
the
interest
of
the
university
as
it
sees
it,
namely
from
the
standpoint
of
what
is
best
professionally.
now,
the
university
has
to
look
at
that
professional
judgment
and
crank
it
in
with
the
other
considerations
that
it
deems
desirable
to
the
welfare
of
the
university
as
a
whole
and
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
may
not
be
always.
for
example,
let
us
assume
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
might
not
be
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
let
us
assume
you
have
a
language
department
that
decides
that
it
would
be
the
strongest
department
and
the
professors
there
and
the
students
would
get
the
best
benefit
from
giving
tenure
to
a
professor
of
greek.
they
make
that
recommendation
to
the
dean.
the
administration
has
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
it
would
overall
benefit
the
university
more
to
go
for
younger
professors,
instructor's
assistant
professors
they
turn
down
that
recommendation.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
professors
who
made
it
are
going
to
be
taught
of
any
less
or
are
going
to
be
downgraded
when
it
comes
to
promotions.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
had
a
buyer
in
an
industrial
plant
who
is
given
a
management
directive
to
buy
from
the
lowest
bidder
and
he
went
out
and
bought
from
the
highest
bidder,
he
isn't
going
to
hang
around
very
long.
and
that
is
the
nub
of
the
difference
between
the
role
of
the
faculty
in
a
university
and
that
of
a
managerial
employee
in
an
industrial
plant,
and
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconceives
that
in
its
evaluation
of
the
evidence
here.
