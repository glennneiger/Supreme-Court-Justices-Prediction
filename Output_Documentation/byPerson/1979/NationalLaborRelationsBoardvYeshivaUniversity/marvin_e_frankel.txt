mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
all
seem
attracted
by
the
procrustean
myth
and
the
procrustean
fit,
even
those
of
us
who
can't
say
it,
and
i
want
to
say
briefly
on
that
subject
that
we
share
our
friend's
view
that
the
act
is
not
a
comfortable
fit,
but
we
take
the
position
that
as
nearly
as
it
could
be
fitted,
if
you
take
the
principles
of
the
board's
decisions
from
the
industrial
area
and
the
commercial
area
in
determining
who
is
managerial
and
who
is
supervisory,
then
it
would
follow
a
fortiori
that
the
faculty
of
a
general
motors
type
university
is
certainly
within
both
of
those
categories
and
outside
of
the
definition
of
employee
for
that
reason.
it
has
been
said
in
the
discussion
of
this
subject
that
times
have
changed
since
the
middle
ages
when
scholars
came
together
to
think
collegially.
of
course,
we
all
agree
on
that.
but
in
the
sense
that
it
is
pertinent
here
and
on
the
basis
of
the
authorities
from
the
academy
on
which
our
friends
for
the
petitioners
rely,
times
have
not
changed
significantly
at
all.
the
american
association
for
higher
education
in
an
important
document
called,
importantly,
"faculty
participation
in
academic
governance,"
which
we
think
really
means
management,
said
in
the
most
fundamental
sense
the
university
is
the
faculty.
and
in
the
same
footnote
in
our
brief
where
we
quote
that
report,
mr.
bundy,
who
had
some
contact
with
schools,
said
when
it
comes
to
a
crunch
in
a
first
class
university,
it
is
the
faculty
which
decides.
now,
mr.
shechtman
has
said
that
the
faculty
decides
--
and
this
is
undisputed
on
this
record
--
in
the
sense
that
its
decisions
on
curriculum,
on
hiring,
promotions,
tenure
and
the
other
fundamentals
are
almost
always
followed.
he
says
the
faculty
decides
because
the
university
chooses
to
let
them.
my
suggestion
with
deference
is
that
thought
is
without
serious
meaning.
it
is
always
true
of
an
organization
that
those
who
have
the
effective
power
of
decision
have
it
because
those
who
might
take
it
away
choose
to
have
it
reside
where
it
resides.
this
record
and
the
literature
on
both
sides
cite
on
the
briefs
reflect
that
universities
that
choose
to
be
distinguished
or
seek
to
be
distinguished
don't
let
faculties
decide
merely
out
of
generosity
or
on
sufferance
but
because
first
class
faculties
would
not
stay
there
unless
their
interests
were
being
heard,
in
having
their
positions
on
governance
followed
or
respected.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
is
right
but,
of
course,
one
of
the
central
issues
--
and
now
we
are
told
it
is
the
central
issue
on
which
there
is
disagreement
between
the
two
sides
--
is
whether
the
faculty
at
yeshiva
or
at
similar
universities
does
not
act
in
the
interests
of
the
university.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
and
it
concluded
that
without
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
i
very
seriously
disagree
with
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
if
the
board
explained
to
us
exactly
what
it
meant,
we
might
know
better
how
to
change
its
mind.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
would
hope
so,
mr.
justice
white.
the
problem
that
causes
me
to
hesitate
in
simply
saying
yes
is
the
difficulty
in
knowing
what
the
board
is
talking
about.
the
board
has
struggled
heroically
with
what
it
has
found
to
be
a
very
difficult
subject.
but
for
all
the
laboring,
it
has
brought
forth
very
little.
it
has
said
those
words,
the
faculty
acts
in
its
own
interests
rather
than
in
the
interest
of
the
university,
but
it
has
failed
to
tell
us
what
that
could
mean.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
with
fellow
counsel,
there
may
have
been
some
difficulty
in
answering
your
honor's
inquiry
as
to
where
you
could
look
in
this
record
to
find
out
why
and
how
the
faculty
is
acting
in
its
own
interests
rather
than
in
the
interest
of
the
university
when
it
says
such
an
such
course
requirements
ought
to
be
added
to
the
degree
given
by
the
college,
or
we
need
a
good
person
in
romance
languages
to
shore
up
the
yeshiva
college
program,
or
we
ought
to
give
tenure
to
"x"
or
promote
"y"
or
regrettably
we
ought
not
to
reappoint
"z."
now,
those
things
seem
to
me
to
be
managerial
and
supervisory
decisions
of
the
highest
order
and
they
are
obeyed.
and
when
you
go
back
to
this
act
and
you
try
to
make
it
fit
and
you
discover
what
the
board
has
done
in
the
settings
with
which
it
is
familiar,
you
find
that
all
through
industry
people
with
much
lower
level,
much
more
constricted,
narrow,
confined
responsibilities
are
held
to
be
managerial
or
supervisory
when
they
merely
recommend
decisions
of
the
kind
that
this
faculty
is
making
every
day
in
the
week,
and
the
board
never
said
--
and
we
found
looking
through
our
records
that
this
recommendation
to
promote
an
employee
was
made
in
the
employer's
interest.
they
say
we
find
that
this
production
scheduler,
this
section
chief,
this
expeditor
or
whatever
is
managerial
or
supervisory
because
of
what
this
person
does.
and
the
board
i
think
quite
properly
has
assumed
that
what
the
person
does
on
the
job
day
in
and
day
out
is
what
is
meant
to
be
determinative
and
unless
somebody
shows
otherwise
is
in
the
interests
of
the
employer.
now,
the
board
in
its
brief
has
tried
to
shore
up,
to
defend
this
notion
of
acting
in
its
own
interest.
i
want
to
say
about
that,
if
the
court
please,
because
think
it
is
a
matter
of
some
consequence,
that
this
subject
which
has
become
central
on
the
argument,
as
perhaps
it
should
be,
is
only
the
second
of
three
propositions
stated
by
the
board
in
one
sentence
as
the
basis
for
its
decision
in
this
case.
and
that
whole
rationale
is
found
in
a
single
sentence
at
page
68a
of
the
appendix
to
the
board's
petition
for
certiorari.
and
the
board
there
says,
acknowledging
that
the
faculty
engages
in
what
it
calls
collegial
decision-making,
it
says,
"at
yeshiva
university,
faculty
participation
in
collegial
decision-making
is
on
a
collective
rather
than
individual
basis."
and
let
me
stop
over
that
and
say
that
that
notion,
if
one
may
respectfully
call
it
that,
was
the
only
basis
for
the
board's
first
decision
holding
that
faculty
members
are
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
the
only
basis,
and
that
is
the
basis
given
in
the
c.
w.
post
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
and
it
is
a
basis,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
wisely
abandoned
now
by
board
counsel
and
seemingly
by
the
petitioner
union
as
well.
so
the
board
said,
proposition
one,
it
is
on
a
collective
rather
than
individual
basis,
it
is
exercised
in
the
faculty's
own
interests
rather
than
in
the
interests
of
the
employer
--
a
subject
that
we
have
paid
a
fair
amount
of
attention
to
that
i
will
call
the
second
proposition.
and
third,
final
authority
rests
with
the
board
of
trustees.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
correct
to
say
that
that
third
thought
relegated
to
a
footnote
in
the
board's
brief,
is
also
abandoned
and
i
think
again
soundly
abandoned
because
it
has
no
visible
merit.
so
we
are
left
with
the
second
thought,
that
the
faculty
can't
be
deemed
managerial
or
supervisory
because
it
acts
in
its
own
interests.
and
on
that
one
might
argue
as
a
technical
matter
of
the
review
of
an
administrative
agency's
decision,
that
a
three-legged
decision
of
which
two
legs
have
been
shot
away
is
pretty
infirm
to
begin
with.
but
in
any
event,
we
go
to
this
notion
of
own
interests
about
which
we
have
been
talking,
and
i
want
to
say
some
further
things
about
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
it
is
right
that
the
board
said
those
words.
i
would
not
believe
in
terms
of
administrative
law
concepts
about
which
we
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i
think
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
merits
the
respect
that
its
inherent
cogency
and
persuasiveness
imports
and
not
more.
that
is
to
say
if
we
go
back,
i
think
first
of
all
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
law
and
not
a
question
of
fact,
and
that
is
the
only
reason
i
recoil
a
little
from
the
notion
of
a
finding.
the
board,
in
its
response
to
our
brief
opposing
certiorari,
said
that
the
basic
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
over
the
facts
but
over
the
legal
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts.
now,
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
that
is
possible,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
case.
i
would
say
respectfully
that,
again,
to
look
at
facts,
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
under
the
universal
camera
doctrine
that
findings
of
the
agency
ought
to
be
overturned
for
want
of
the
requisite
substantial
evidence,
i
think
this
court
normally
would
not
take
the
case,
if
it
did
it
might
well
pay
considerable
deference
to
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
isn't
a
universal
camera
case.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
fact
findings
of
the
board.
i
suppose
it
would
be
an
easier
case
for
us
if
it
were
such
a
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
question.
i
think
this
is
a
case
--
and
here
as
in
some
other
rare
instances
we
agree
with
the
board
--
where
the
question
is
one
of
law
and
where
universal
camera,
for
example,
won't
be
found
cited
in
the
board's
brief
as
it
shouldn't
be.
it
is
found
in
the
union's
brief,
but
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
portions
of
the
brief
where
it
is
cited
and
where
this
subject
is
discussed,
you
will
discover
that
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
mr.
shechtman
is
treating
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
though
it
were
an
agency
decision
and
is
raising
the
question
of
whether
it
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that
is
a
peculiar
reversal
of
roles,
and
i
think
it
is
not
useful
to
the
court
in
deciding
this
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
this
is
where
the
court
made
a
different
decision
on
a
question
of
law
from
facts
which
as
they
come
to
this
court
are
undisputed.
the
ultimate
finding
is
about
the
powers
of
this
faculty,
the
scope
of
its
authority,
the
subject
on
which
it
decides
commonly
with
finality,
all
of
those
things
come
here
undisputed,
and
the
only
question
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
would
say
that
the
board
there
is
giving
a
conclusion
which,
however
you
try
to
characterize
it,
has
no
basis
in
the
record.
i
think
they
are
using
in
their
own
interest
as
a
legal
conception
because
they
are
taking
the
words
out
of
section
211
of
the
act
which
use
those
words
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
in
order
to
define
supervisory
and
they
are
saying
these
people
are
not
supervisors
under
211
because
although
they
do
these
various
things
that
are
the
kinds
of
things
supervisors
do,
they
do
them
in
their
own
interests
somehow
and
not
in
the
interests
of
the
employer.
now,
the
trouble
with
that,
whatever
you
call
it,
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
say
what
they
are
talking
about
to
make
it
rational
or
coherent
or
acceptable
or
meaningful.
there
is
no
place
you
can
look
in
the
record
to
answer
the
question
of
how
would
you
know
if
they
were
acting
in
the
university's
interests
or
why
aren't
all
these
things
that
are
really
what
the
university
is
about,
what
the
university
is
in
business
for,
why
aren't
all
of
these
things
as
much
the
university's
interests
as
a
top
managerial
person's
decisions
of
what
model
to
bring
out,
what
course
of
production
to
follow,
what
schedule
to
follow,
or
anything
else.
what
i
am
saying
is
they
are
words
devoid
of
foundation
factually
and
i
think
legally.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
insofar
as
they
were
not
themselves
starting
professors,
which
by
definition
they
would
not
be,
then
i
think
it
would
be
in
the
university's
interest.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
this
would
affect
their
interests.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
is
no
question
at
some
point
when
the
chairman
of
the
manufacturing
company
makes
a
recommendation
to
the
board
that
they
go
into
a
certain
line
of
endeavor
that
he
thinks
is
going
to
be
very
profitable,
and
he
has
stock
options
that
will
not
be
diminished
in
his
view
by
that
course
of
action,
he
is
furthering
his
own
interests
as
well.
i
don't
say
that
you
can
hermetically
seal
them,
but
i
think
if
you
look
some
of
the
authority
the
board
has
suggested
to
us
or
some
of
the
conceptions
they
have
suggested
to
us,
you
may
get
a
sense,
i
think
the
court
will
get
a
sense
of
how
empty
of
meaning
this
locution
is
in
this
decision.
the
board
has
said,
and
mr.
come
has
said
orally,
that
the
faculty
is
not
looked
to
for
these
governing
responsibilities.
there
is
no
way
of
saying
what
that
means.
if
you
look
in
this
record,
you
will
find
--
and
we
cited
some
of
the
places,
though
not
all
of
them
--
that
faculty
is
expected
to
serve
on
committees,
faculty
is
expected
to
engage
in
governance,
and
the
performance
of
faculty
in
considering
matters
like
promotion
and
tenure,
performance
of
faculty
in
these
areas
is
among
the
factors
considered.
they
don't
do
this
just
because
they
are
permitted
to.
they
are
not
merely
tolerated.
they
are
expected
to
do
it
and
they
expect
to
be
given
the
power
to
do
it
in
this
relationship.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
in
general
that
--
it
is
prior
to
this
act,
of
course,
but
i
would
say
in
general
that
would
have
been
true.
and
as
i
read
and
have
read
for
this
case
and
in
some
prior
incarnations,
the
writings
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors
and
others,
i
would
say
basically
that
is
the
view
of
academicians
today
about
the
university.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
possible
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
record
illustrates
in
a
couple
of
ways
the
kind
of
spectrum
--
which
is
not
my
word
but
that
of
the
national
educational
association
in
its
amicus
brief
--
alone
which
faculties
fall.
there
is
a
first
circuit
case
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
involving
a
school
called
wentworth
institute
where
the
faculty
worked
on
one-year
contracts
where
the
faculty
had
a
curriculum
committee
which
the
first
circuit
noted
nobody
paid
any
attention
to,
where
the
faculty
had
other
committees
that
confined
themselves
to
things
like
sporting
events,
the
arrangements
for
sympathetic
gifts
to
people
in
the
institution
who
became
unwell,
and
things
of
that
nature.
and
so
it
was
a
faculty
that
did
indeed
consist
of
employees
who
went
in
and
taught,
which
is
a
professional
task,
and
perhaps
made
their
course
outlines
and
arranged
and
managed
their
own
classroom,
but
did
nothing
about
the
running
of
the
institution
and
were
not
permitted
or
expected
to
do
that.
and
i
would
say
that
the
board,
if
it
corrected
its
misconceptions
as
we
see
them
on
this
subject,
might
well
place
a
wentworth
institute
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
that
the
nea
talks
about
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
has
relevance,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
this
degree
--
which
i
must
answer
somewhat
hypothetically
--
insofar
as
these
words
that
mr.
justice
white
and
i
conversed
about,
in
their
own
interests.
our
thought
to
import
fact
finding
of
some
kind
and
insofar
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
rejecting
that
statement
overturned
that
fact
finding,
this
might
be
a
universal
camera
case,
an
extraordinarily
rare
kind
of
case.
i
must
repeat
i
think
in
fairness
to
both
sides
that
it
is
not
the
basis
on
which
certiorari
was
sought.
if
it
had
been,
one
might
want
to
consider
whether
it
might
have
seen
improvidently
granted,
because
it
is
not
a
good
universal
camera
case.
nobody
has
argued
really
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
misconceives
or
misapplies
the
universal
camera
test,
because
that
is
not
what
the
case
was
brought
to
the
court
about
all.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
have
frankly,
mr.
justice
brennan,
tended
to
think
the
answer
is
probably
no,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
overturned
agency
fact
finding
in
the
sense
that
i
understand
universal
camera
to
be
concerned
with.
but
as
has
happened,
i
could
be
wrong
in
this,
and
if
mr.
shechtman's
efforts
to
make
this
a
universal
camera
case
is
more
substantial
than
we
have
supposed
it
to
be,
then
the
court
i
think
would
want
to
reconsider
the
whole
business
and
decide
whether
this
case
belongs
here
at
all
--
and
i
must
say
on
that
that
a
very
imperfect
cursory
scarcely
scrutable
agency
decision
with
a
record
where
the
first
time
you
meet
really
competent
fact
findings
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
in
the
agency,
one
might
want
to
conjure
that
question.
now,
i
want
to
approach
an
end,
as
i
think
i
must,
by
saying
another
thing
or
two
about
the
university.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
briefs,
amicus,
opposing
our
position
about
questions
of
policy,
as
they
are
put,
speaking
of
the
university
frequently
as
if
it
consisted
in
some
adversary
way
of
a
management,
so
described,
meaning
i
suppose
the
administration
on
one
side,
and
a
rank
and
file
faculty,
a
phrase
frequently
used
by
the
board,
on
the
other.
and
i
suppose
most
of
us
would
not
wish
to
be
on
or
be
taught
by
something
called
rank
and
file
faculty,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
conception
that
is
used
in
this
kind
of
university.
but
passing
that,
let
me
say
that
what
is
left
out
of
those
amicus
briefs
are
interests
that
are
critical
in
today's
university,
interests
of
students,
of
alumni,
of
trustees,
of
eve
widening
publics
that
have
a
focused
concern
with
the
university.
those
interests
are
what
give
point
and
justification
to
our
notions
of
academic
freedom.
whenever
academic
freedom
is
mentioned
on
the
briefs,
it
seems
to
consist
only
of
freedom
of
faculty
to
resist
or
oppose
or
be
left
alone
by
the
administration.
it
means
much
more
than
that.
now,
those
policy
questions
we
believe
are
mostly
not
central
to
this
case.
they
were
not
central
to
the
board
in
its
decision.
but
i
do
want
to
say,
because
i
think
the
setting
ought
to
be
clear,
that
if
they
were
and
if
this
were
a
question
now
of
legislative
policy,
we
would
want
to
emphasize
the
view
that
taken
by
sanford
kadish,
when
he
was
professor
kadish,
now
dean
of
--
when
he
was
president
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors,
and
when
he
said
in
his
presidential
address,
speaking
about
academic
freedom
and
problems
that
concern
us
here,
he
said
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
raises
problems
in
the
university
even
apart
from
the
strike.
in
dividing
the
university
into
worker
professors
and
manager
administrators
and
governing
boards,
it
imperils
the
premise
of
shared
authority,
encourages
the
polarization
in
interests
and
exaggerates
the
adversary
concerns
of
interests
held
in
common.
he
went
on
to
say
that
it
causes
loss
of
and
peril
to
the
basic
conception
of
the
faculty
as
the
primary
governor
of
the
university.
i
want
to
add
that
when
archibald
cox,
who
stood
here
very
often
and
who
prior
to
that
had
earned
some
repute
as
a
student
of
labor
law,
sat
on
a
commission
to
consider
the
tragic
events
in
1968
at
columbia,
his
commission
at
the
end
made
a
report
that
has
become
fairly
well
known,
and
as
part
of
that
report,
in
a
very
few
words,
mr.
cox
and
his
distinguished
colleagues
under
took
to
identify
what
they
called
the
essential
quality
of
the
institution,
the
university,
and
they
said
--
and
it
sounds
medieval,
but
they
said
in
1968-69,
"the
university
is
a
community
of
scholars,
both
teachers
and
students."
they
said
more,
but
i
see
the
read
light
and
i
thank
you
honors.
