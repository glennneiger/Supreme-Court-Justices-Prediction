does
the

show
who
has
authority
to
engage
professions?

justice

the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
yeshiva
university
to
bargain
collectively
with
school
and
faculty
members.
the
dispute
arose
when
the
university
refused
to
bargain
with
a
union
representing
the
full-time
faculty.
the
university
contended
that
faculty
members
are
supervisory
and
managerial
employees
and
therefore
are
excluded
from
the
act.
the
national
labor
relations
board
disagreed.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
concluding
that
yeshiva
faculty
substantially
and
pervasively
operates
the
enterprise,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
full-time
faculty
members
were
managerial
employees.
we
agree
with
this
conclusion.
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
faculty
exercise
its
authority
which
is
unquestionably
managerial.
they
effectively
determined
for
example
what
courses
will
be
offered,
when
they
will
be
scheduled,
to
whom
they
will
be
taught,
and
who
will
be
graduated.
they
also
make
recommendation
usually
accepted
as
to
faculty
hiring,
tenure,
sabbaticals,
termination,
and
promotion.
faculty
members
undoubtedly
also
exercise
professional
judgment
in
making
these
decisions.
it
is
clear
however
that
the
decisions
reflect
the
interest
and
policy
of
the
university
as
well
as
the
professional
interest
of
the
faculty.
nor
can
we
defer
in
this
case
to
the
expertise
of
the
board
as
it
made
no
specific
findings
of
fact
and
arrived
at
a
conclusion
we
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
the
act.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun.
