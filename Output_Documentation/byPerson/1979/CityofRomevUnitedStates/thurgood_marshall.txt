as
i
get
it,
the
only
way
for
that
would
be
for
the
legislature
to
say
we
are
doing
this
for
the
express
purpose
of
discriminating
against
the
minorities.
now,
if
they
don't
say
that,
that's
it.
is
that
your
position?
justice

thank
you.
justice

we
wouldn't
reach
a
constitutional
claim,
i
take
it,
if
there
was
some
nonconstitutional
basis
upon
which
we
could
decide
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
reviewed
a
three-judge
court's
findings
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis?
justice
thurgood

this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
its
applicability
to
electoral
changes
and
annexations
made
by
the
city
of
rome,
georgia.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
also
hold
that
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
act
to
the
city
of
rome's
electoral
changes
and
annexations.
in
1966,
the
city
fundamentally
altered
its
electoral
scheme.
the
most
important
modification
involved
the
requirement,
that
commissioners
in
board
education
members
would
henceforth
be
elected
concurrently
by
a
majority
of
the
at-large
votes,
not
by
a
plurality.
there
is
no
candidate
for
a
particular
position
received
a
majority
of
the
vote,
a
runoff
election
would
be
held
between
the
two
candidates
who
have
received
the
largest
number
of
votes.
provision
for
numbered
posts
and
staggered
terms
were
also
adopted.
in
addition,
the
city
made
60
annexations
between
november
1,
1964
and
february
10
of
1975.
the
state
of
georgia
is
a
jurisdiction
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act.
section
5
of
that
act
requires
that
the
city's
electoral
changes
and
annexations
be
precleared
either
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
preclearance
is
authorized
only
if
the
electoral
change
or
annexation
"does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color."
the
attorney
general
refused
to
preclear
the
electoral
changes
and
some
of
the
annexations.
the
city
then
filed
this
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
whereupon
the
three-judge
district
court
rejected
the
city's
constitutional
challenge
of
the
act
and
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
united
states
finding
that
the
disapproved
electoral
changes
and
annexations
although
not
made
for
indiscriminatory
purposes
did
have
a
discriminatory
effect.
we
affirmed
and
thereby
reject
all
of
the
city's
procedural
and
constitutional
challenges
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
we
hold
that
the
city
may
not
exempt
itself
from
the
act.
the
language
of
the
act
in
this
legislative
history
plainly
indicates
that
only
the
state
of
georgia
and
not
a
political
subdivision
may
bring
an
action
to
bail
out
the
act's
--
from
under
the
act's
coverage.
we
also
hold
that
the
attorney
general's
decision
to
deny
preclearance
was
timely.
we
find
no
merit
in
any
of
the
city's
constitutional
challenge
to
the
act.
first,
we
note
that
congress
enacted
the
voting
rights
act
under
the
enforcement
authority
accorded
to
it
by
the
fifteenth
amendment,
even
assuming
that
section
1
of
that
amendment
prohibits
only
purposeful
racial
discrimination
in
voting,
the
enforcement
power
of
congress
is
broad
enough
to
allow
it
to
outlaw
voting
practice
that
are
discriminatory
in
effect.
we
so
held
in
the
1966
decision
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
and
we
refused
to
move
away
from
that
view
that
the
civil
war
amendments
vested
congress
with
wide
ranging
authority
to
rid
our
country
of
racially
discriminatory
practices.
the
civil
war
amendments
also
overwrite
any
principles
of
federalism
that
might
otherwise
have
been
an
obstacle
to
adoption
of
that
act.
second,
we
repudiate
the
city's
argument
that
assuming
that
the
act
was
an
appropriate
exercise
of
congressâ€™
congressional
power
in
1965,
it
had
outlived
its
usefulness
by
1975.
when
congress
extended
it
for
another
seven
years
to
the
contrary,
we
uphold
congress'
considered
determination
that
at
least
another
seven
years
of
statutory
remedies
were
necessary
to
counter
the
perpetuation
of
95
years
of
pervasive
voting
discrimination.
third,
we
find
that
the
act
was
not
operated
to
deny
the
citizens
of
rome,
their
first,
fifth,
ninth
or
tenth
amendment
rights.
we
uphold
all
of
the
factual
findings
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
we
agree
that
the
electoral
changes
from
plurality-win
to
majority-win
elections,
numbered
posts,
staggered
terms,
when
combined
with
the
presence
of
racial
bloc
voting,
rome's
majority
white
population
and
at-large
electoral
system
would
dilute
the
negro
vote.
we
also
agree
that
the
city
failed
to
prove
that
the
disapproved
annexation
would
not
dilute
the
voting
power
of
the
negro
community
in
rome.
the
voting
rights
act
is
admittedly
a
strong
medicine
but
it
is
strong
medicine
designed
to
treat
a
pernicious
condition.
as
we
recognized
the
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
"insidious
and
pervasive
evil
of
racial
segregation
discrimination
in
this
voting
had
been
perpetuated
in
certain
parts
of
this
country
by
unremitting
and
ingenious
defiance
of
the
constitution."
today,
we
affirm
our
holding
in
that
decision
where
we
stated
that
the
act
is
an
appropriate
means
for
carrying
out
congress'
constitutional
responsibilities
and
is
consonant
with
all
provisions
of
the
constitution.
