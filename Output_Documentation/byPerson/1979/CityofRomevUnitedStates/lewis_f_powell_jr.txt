justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
may
i
interrupt?
will
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
how
a
state
may
be
relieved
from
the
obligation
to
comply
with
section
5?
you
take
the
position
that
a
city
may
not
bail
out
under
any
circumstances,
how
does
a
state
get
out?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
what
must
it
show?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
mean
if
one
county
failed
to
comply
with
that,
that
the
rest
of
the
state
would
remain
under
the
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
the
smallest
unit
in
a
state
can
keep
the
entire
state
under
the
act
indefinitely?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
act
is
temporary?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
what
katzenbach
said.
