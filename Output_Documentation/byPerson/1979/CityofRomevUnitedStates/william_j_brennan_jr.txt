what
is
it,
except
for
this
situation,
is
it
a
biennial
or
election
every
two
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
every
four
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
terms
at
first,
i
guess,
were
of
differing
lengths,
to
introduce
the
staggered
terms,
but
thereafter
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thereafter
they
were
four-year
terms?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brinson,
it's
been
a
while
since
i
read
the
briefs
in
this
case,
do
i
recollect
correctly
that
the
population
makeup
of
your
city
is
about
three-quarters
white
and
one-quarter
negro?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
read
us
that
finding,
have
there
been
negro
office
holders
in
the
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
neither
one
was
elected?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
election
was
at
large
both
before
and
after
1966?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
republican
form
of
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
submit
that
the
effect
language
in
the
section
is
unsupported,
is
unsupportable
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
argue
that
congress
has
no
power.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
prohibit
electoral
changes
that
have
no
discriminatory
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
argue
that
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
do
argue,
then,
that
congress
had
--
that
the
effect
language
in
section
5
as
it
permits
--
if
it
forbids
changes
without
discriminatory
purposes,
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
majority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
require
us
to
overturn
the
finding
of
the
district
court?
