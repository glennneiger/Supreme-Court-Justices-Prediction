mr.
robert
m.
brinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
city
of
rome
and
two
of
its
citizens
in
a
section
5
matter,
which
is
somewhat
broader
than
a
section
5,
voting
rights
act
of
1965
matter.
the
city
of
rome
is
a
city
of
some
30,000
persons.
it
lies
65
miles
or
so
northwest
of
atlanta,
georgia.
i
am
on
my
23rd
visit
to
the
city
of
washington
in
an
effort
to
get
preclearance
of
my
city's
growth
and
government
under
section
5,
the
preclearance
provision
of
the
voting
rights
act,
a
provision
which
we
here
challenge.
the
city
of
rome
is
governed
by
a
council-manager
form
of
government,
which
has
been
elected
at
large
since
1918.
in
1966,
during
a
time
when,
or
soon
after
this
court's
reapportionment
cases,
and
during
those
reapportionment
cases
the
city
attorney,
upon
request
from
the
then
governing
council,
recommended
to
the
city
council
that
certain
changes
needed
to
be
made,
as
he
understood
the
reappointment
cases,
as
they
existed
at
that
time.
the
reason
for
his
recommendation
was
the
city
of
rome
was
divided
into
nine
wards
of
very
disparate
size,
and
even
though
the
city
council
was
elected
at
large
there
was
a
residency
requirement.
at
that
time
there
was
a
case
pending
under
the
title
of
dusch
v.
davis
in
the
lower
court,
where
that
system
of
government
had
been
challenged.
and
that
ultimately
made
this
court
and
it
was
reversed.
but
at
that
time
the
law
was
in
question.
the
city
attorney
recommended
that
certain
provisions
of
the
charter
of
the
city
of
rome
be
changed
at
that
time.
among
which
were
the
wards
situation,
should
be
changed
from
nine
to
three;
and,
at
the
same
time,
some
housecleaning
matters
in
the
government
should
be
also
changed.
as
of
that
time,
in
1964
the
georgia
election
code
required
a
majority
vote;
and
although
that
code
did
not
specifically
apply
to
municipalities
in
georgia,
it
did
serve
as
an
unofficial
guide
for
local
charter.
he
recommended
that
majority
vote
be
instituted.
and
noting
that
there
was
a
tendency
from
time
to
time
for
both
the
county
government
and
the
city
government
to
be
swept
completely
out
of
office,
he
recommended,
in
order
to
assure
some
continuity
of
government,
that
staggered
terms
be
instituted.
and
the
staggered
terms,
the
best
way
to
set
them
up
would
be
to
provide
for
numbered
posts.
he
also,
to
make
consistent
the
charter
with
respect
to
the
city
commission
and
the
board
of
education,
recommended
that
residency
requirements
be
instituted
for
the
board
of
education,
as
they
were
required
for
the
city
commission.
so
that
these
electoral
changes
which
were
made
in
1966
by
the
georgia
legislature
were
the
majority
vote;
numbered
posts;
staggered
terms;
and
residency
requirement
for
the
board
of
education.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
and
reduction
of
nine
wards
to
three.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that
is
correct.
these
changes
took
place
--
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
the
same
time
these
changes
took
place,
on
the
state
front,
on
the
general
state
law
front,
the
georgia
municipal
election
code
in
1968,
which
also
contained
majority
vote
provision
and
a
numbered
post
provision,
for
statewide
application,
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
precleared.
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
when
the
changes
of
the
city
of
rome
were
made,
it
was
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
allen
vs.
board
of
elections,
and
perkins
vs.
matthews.
and
quite
a
while
prior
to,
in
fact
five
years
prior
to
the
time
that
the
attorney
general
even
had
regulations
governing
the
manner
in
which
submissions
under
section
5
were
to
be
made.
the
city
of
rome
in
1974
had
an
annexation
of
a
rather
large
--
at
least
for
the
city
of
rome
--
section
over
its
objection;
that
is,
over
the
city
government's
objection.
it
was
imposed
upon
them
by
the
state
legislature
because
of
a
great
need
of
sewer
services
within
this
island
in
the
city
of
rome.
it
was
an
island,
the
city
of
rome
surrounded
an
unincorporated
area.
so
that
the
--
over
the
actual
objection
of
the
rome
city
commission,
the
state
of
georgia,
the
local
legislative
delegation
imposed
the
annexation
of
that
area
on
the
city.
it
was
a
state
law
by
which
that
annexation
took
place,
although
annexation
can
also
take
place
by
ordinance.
in
1974
that
annexation
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
then
city
attorney.
the
attorney
general
wrote
back
and
said
that
he
could
not
preclear
it
until
he
learned
about
the
city
government
and
what
it
was
like.
whereupon,
the
city
provided
additional
information
as
to
what
the
city,
how
the
city
was
structured,
and
that
included
the
1966
electoral
changes.
the
attorney
general
then
refused
to
preclear
both
that
annexation
and
the
electoral
changes.
and,
in
addition,
he
had
inquired
about
the
number
of
annexations
which
had
occurred
since
1964.
there
were
a
total
of
60
annexations,
which
had
taken
place
during
a
ten-year
period.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
four
of
them
had
been
state
legislature,
and
the
balance
were
by
ordinance.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
so
that
after
the
exchange
between
the
city
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
there
remained
the
unprecleared
electoral
changes
and
13
of
the
annexations.
in
the
meantime,
the
city
of
rome
had
conducted
some
five
or
six
elections
under
the
changes
which
they
had
made
in
1966,
including
the
staggered
terms
provision.
so
that
there
were
members
right
in
the
middle
of
their
term.
it
was
determined,
as
of
the
objection
time,
that
no
further
elections
were
feasible
under
the
then
existing
interplay
of
federal
and
state
law.
so
that
no
election
has
been
held
in
rome
since
1974.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
yes.
no,
i
believe
it's
every
four
years.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
right,
to
initiate
the
staggered
terms.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
whereupon
the
city
of
rome
filed
suit
in
the
only
jurisdiction
in
which
it
can
file
suit,
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
to
seek
not
only
a
review
of
the
attorney
general's
action
or
the
constitutionality
of
the
attorney
general's
action,
but
bail-out.
and
at
which
time
it
also
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
section
5,
and
also
asked
that
it
be
permitted
to
bail
out
under
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
made
many
findings
of
fact,
to
which
i
commend
this
court
for
its
careful
reading,
which
we
have
itemized
in
the
brief
and
have
shown
that
there
have
been
some
18
particular
findings
which
are
characterized
according
to
the
zimmer
standards,
under
zimmer
vs.
mckeithen.
the
city
of
rome
took
the
position
that
in
order
to
carry
its
burden
approving
no
purpose
and
no
effect,
that
the
zimmer
standards
were
applicable,
at
least
were
a
guide
by
which
they
could
prove
the
lack
of
discriminatory
effect
in
the
changes
and
annexations.
the
court
below
found
that
there
was
not,
had
not
been
used
in
the
city
of
rome
any
literacy
test
for
the
17-year
period
required
by
the
act.
the
court
also
found
no
past
discrimination.
the
court
also
found
a
total
access
to
the
political
process,
and,
to
quote
the
court,
it
said
that
the
city
officials
of
rome
were
quite
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
minorities.
and,
most
remarkably,
with
respect
to
the
political
power
of
minorities
in
the
city
of
rome,
i
quote
the
specific
findings
of
the
court
below
blacks
often
hold
the
balance
of
power
in
rome
elections.
and
in
rome
politics,
the
black
community,
if
it
chooses
to
vote
as
a
group,
can
probably
determine
the
outcome
of
many,
if
not
most,
contests.
the
many
others,
detailing
and
generalizing
the
findings
as
to
the
representations
provided
by
the
city
of
rome
for
the
minorities
are
set
out
on
pages
5
through
7
of
the
brief.
quite
frankly,
i
think
they
are
remarkable,
and
i'm
proud
of
my
city
for
having
conducted
its
own
affirmative
action
plan;
that's
about
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that
is
correct,
almost
exactly.
it's
about
76
to
23.4
percent.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
there
have
been
no
elected
black
officials
in
the
city
of
rome.
however,
there's
been
only
one
black
citizen
who
ran
for
office
after
the
change
times,
and
only
one
significant
candidate
who
ran
before
the
electoral
changes
were
made.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
neither
one
was
elected.
there
in
one
appointed
on
the
board
of
education,
which
is
a
six-member
board.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
the
city
takes
the
position
that,
among
its
basic
positions
that
it
did
take
from
the
very
beginning,
at
the
first
instance,
was
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act,
and
that
is
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
a
provision,
that
is
section
5,
which
permits
the
attorney
general
or
the
court
to
deny
preclearance
merely
on
effect.
because
the
lower
court
found
the
city
of
rome
completely
innocent
of
any
purposeful
discrimination
in
any
of
its
electoral
changes
or
annexations.
that
was
a
specific
finding
by
the
lower
court.
thus
the
question
is
squarely
presented
to
this
court
whether
or
not
congress
indeed
has
the
power
to
prescribe
those
changes
which
may
have
arguable
discriminatory
effect
alone.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that
is
correct.
we
do
that.
we
do
argue
that
point.
that
is
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
enforcement
clause.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
we
say
that
the
substitute
provision,
section
4
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
controls
just
what
they
can
enforce,
that
congress
can
only
enforce
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
don't
agree
that
it
has,
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
we
have
analyzed
the
katzenbach
vs.
morgan
case
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
and
oregon
vs.
mitchell
as
well.
and
we
found
that,
nevertheless,
it
is
based
on
some
rational
fact-finding,
that
in
that
case
what
the
court
did
was
analyze
what
congress
had
done
and
congress
had
specifically,
with
its
fact-finding
powers,
had
determined
that
the
abolition
of
the
literacy
test
would
--
that
the
existence
of
a
literacy
test
denied
services
to
non-english
speaking
people,
and
that
also
it
denied
the
voting
rights,
and
that
a
specific
way
to
counter
that
would
be
to
prohibit
the
literacy
test.
but
that
was
based
on
a
fact-finding
with
specific
reference
to
the
literacy
test
itself.
the
literacy
test,
the
national
application
of
the
prohibition
of
literacy
test
was
also
subject
to
that
fact-finding
in
oregon
vs.
mitchell.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
the
point
that
we
make
is
that,
as
was
noted
in
oregon
v.
mitchell,
that
there
are
three
--
as
justice
black
noted
in
oregon
v.
mitchell,
the
three
things
that
congress
can
do
are
to
enforce
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
cannot
strip
the
states
of
their
power
--
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
--
but
with
reference
to
states,
it
cannot
strip
the
states
of
their
power,
and
can
only
enact
appropriate
legislation,
appropriate
with
respect
to
the
state
power
reserved
to
it.
we
contend
that,
first
of
all,
and
the
question
that
i've
not
yet
reached,
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
does
prohibit
only
purposeful
discrimination,
a
question
which
we
say
--
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
has
been
decided,
i
know
that
it
is
before
the
court
now
in
another
case
--
it
is
also
before
the
court
in
this
case.
but
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
the
court's
treatment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
reflected
in
the
washington
v.
davis,
and
more
recently
in
the
finney
case.
but
it
is
also
consistent
with
gomillion
vs.
lightfoot,
and
the
wright
case,
as
well
as
nevett
vs.
sides,
a
case
from
the
fifth
circuit.
but
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
congress
does
have
the
power
to
expand
the
substantive
provision
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
section
1.
if
section
1
does
not
proscribe
innocent
electoral
changes,
then
we
contend
that
congress
cannot
prescribe
innocent
electoral
changes,
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
expand
that
provision.
and
the
appropriateness
of
such
legislation
with
respect
to
the
states,
which
is
the
test
as
established
in
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
--
it
is
not.
because
the
other
way
that
has
been
justified
is
that
there
is
some
nexus
or
some
prior
discrimination.
in
every
other
voting
rights
case
there
has
been
some
indication
of
discrimination
otherwise.
some
prior
discrimination
which
has
a
present
nexus
to
the
existing
effect.
and
that
does
not
exist
in
rome.
that
was
found
to
be
excluded
with
respect
to
past
discrimination.
it
was
found
that
the
present
--
it
was
an
actual
finding,
it
was
not
just
a
lack
thereof.
the
city
of
rome
proved
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
understand
that
it
has
been
held
to
be
also
enacted
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
right.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
yes,
sir.
now,
however,
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
title
vii
can
be
applicable
to
cities
or
states,
because
of
the
reserve
power
of
the
states,
and
that
there
is
an
additional
consideration.
because
of
states
qua
states,
as
we're
reminded
in
the
national
league
of
cities
case.
i
realize
that
that
was
a
commerce
clause
case,
nevertheless,
it
revivified
the
existence
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
federalism
principle.
i
think
that
fitspatrick
v.
bitzer,
which
was
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
holding.
and
that
where
there's
application
to
state
action
or
to
states
as
states,
that
an
additional
consideration
is
there,
and
that
is
the
federalism
principle
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
of
the
fourth
section
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
the
guaranty
clause.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
one
of
the
considerations,
i
think,
that
has
been
discussed
in
these
cases
is
that,
well,
congress
considered
the
federalism
principle
when
it
enacted
the
statute
in
question.
and
that
may
be
true,
but
i
remind
the
court
in
this
case
that
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
an
entirely
different
animal
from
such
remedies
as
title
vii.
it
is
an
entirely
different
kind,
and
one
that
has
been
observed
to
be
a
vast
departure
from
our
ordinary
concepts
of
federalism.
and
i
would
remind
the
court
also
that
it
has
application
only
to
a
few
states.
therefore,
when
congress
passed
section
5,
it
could
not
have
been
considered
to
uphold
the
federalism
principle
because
it
was
applicable
to
only
a
few
states.
this
has
been
particularly
noted,
i
think,
by
mr.
justice
powell,
who,
in
his
various
dissents
with
respect
to
the
voting
rights
act,
has
noted
that
it
is
made
more
noxious
by
its
applicability
to
a
few
states.
the
national
league
of
cities
decision
--
again,
although
a
decision
involving
commerce
power
--
points
out
that
federalism
principles
prevent
congress
from
enacting
a
law
that
interferes
with
the
state's
separate
and
independent
existence.
we
have
attempted
to
show
in
our
brief
just
how
this
interference
has
occurred.
it
has
been
a
criticism
for
quite
some
time,
and
it
was
indeed
a
criticism
on
theoretical
basis
in
the
katzenbach
case.
and
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
rehear
the
katzenbach
case,
we
have
attempted
to
make
that
clear,
that
katzenbach
is
clear
--
many
times
the
language
of
katzenbach,
that
the
court
was
then
addressing
and
that
congress
was
addressing
purposeful
discrimination.
the
very
terms
that
are
used
throughout
the
katzenbach
case
refer
to
the
evil
of
purposeful
discrimination.
the
contrivances
of
discrimination.
moreover,
it
was
also
important
in
south
carolina
vs.
katzenbach,
and
they
noted,
and
based
their
justification
of
section
5
on
the
temporary
nature
of
the
act;
that
is,
the
intent
of
the
congress
at
the
time
was
that
it
would
last
five
years.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
we
do
not,
your
honor;
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
be
within
our
argument
about
the
constitutionality.
so
that
congress
could
not
be
considered
to
have
expanded
the
limitations
on
section
1,
or
limitations
provided
by
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
construction
is
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
we
do.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
we
do
indeed
argue
that,
your
honor,
except
that
we
argue
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
because
we
feel
that
the
congress
--
unless
the
statute
is
interpreted
the
way
we
suggested,
that
it
has
expanded
those
limitations
of
section
1.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
no,
sir,
we
argue
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
to
the
extent
that
congress
so
intended.
or
to
the
extent
that
it's
been
applied
by
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
don't
believe
this
court
has.
i
believe
that
wherever
this
court
has
had
a
voting
rights
case,
it
has
involved
purposeful
discrimination.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
in
beer
there
was
--
it
was
at
least
noted
in
the
dissent
that
there
was
purposeful
discrimination,
that
it
was
involved.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fact
that
there
had
been
discrimination
in
the
city,
there
had
been
a
history
of
discrimination,
but
in
looking
to
effect,
the
issue
was
not
before
the
court
at
the
time,
but
in
looking
at
the
effect,
there
was
the
cognizance
that
the
city
had
had
a
history
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
the
findings
in
this
case
would
support
our
proposition,
because
they
are
exactly
and
specifically
that
we
have
no
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
well,
we
do
very
well,
that
is
still
another
argument
that
we
made,
that
there
is
no
effect
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
yes,
it
would.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
that's
correct.
and
we
do
argue
that
principle.
we
argue,
first
of
all,
that
it's
unconstitutional,
as
being
expansion
of
substantive
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
argue
that
if
you
can
construe
the
act
to
provide
that
where
there's
purpose,
then
there
should
be
no
preclearance.
if
there
is
the,
also,
on
effect.
if
it's
not
clear
whether
there's
purpose,
then
you
look
at
the
effect
that
exists
and
see
if
you
can
infer
purpose.
and
then
if
there
is
effect
alone,
that
--
without
purpose,
or
if
there
can
be
no
inference
of
purpose,
then
the
provision
should
be
precleared.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
it
was
not
decided,
we
contend,
your
honor,
because
the
question,
first
of
all,
was
not
before
the
court,
and
it
is
clear
from
the
court's
decision
that
it
was
considering
purposeful
discrimination;
that
those
were
the
evils
to
which
it
was
directing
--
to
which
congress
was
directing
the
act,
and
the
reasons
for
justifying
the
act
were
the
unique
circumstances
existing
at
the
time.
and
we
contend
that
those
unique
circumstances
don't
exist
now,
and
did
not
exist
at
the
time
that
the
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
re-enacted
in
1975.
we
contend
that
the
fact
that
there
were
unique
circumstances
was
the
way
that
the
court
justified
the
intrusiveness
or
the
uniqueness
of
the
section
5
other
remedy.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
well,
we
do
not
concede
that
issue,
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
am
saying
in
any
event.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
i
am
saying
that.
because
we
have
several
alternative
approaches
to
this,
and
the
fact,
first
of
all
they
were
looking
at
purposeful
discrimination,
that
was
the
evil
to
which
the
court
and
congress
were
directing
in
1965
and
'66.
but
that
in
any
event,
in
looking
at
it
today,
there's
a
different
set
of
circumstances,
and
in
the
re-enactment
in
1975
there
was
a
different
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
claim
there
was
that
non-english
speaking
people
had
been
intentionally
discriminated
against
with
respect
to
city
services,
or,
rather,
services,
governmental
services.
and
that
there
had
been
an
intentional
discrimination
of
the
right
to
vote
previously.
but
that
the
particular
change,
the
particular
literacy
requirements
had
been
utilized
intentionally,
and
therefore
it
was
promiscuous
under
the
congressional
fact-finding
to
outlaw.
here,
to
show
the
court
our
effect
argument,
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
congress
can
outlaw
non-purposeful
discriminatory
changes,
there
is
no
effect
here.
mr.
robert
m.
brinson
thank
you.
