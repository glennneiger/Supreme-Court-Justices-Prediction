mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
very
little,
if
anything,
is
involved
in
this
case,
other
than
faithful
application
by
the
district
court
to
the
facts
before
it
of
the
principles
established
by
this
court's
pertinent
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
for
me
to
say,
mr.
justice.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
before
the
time
for
filing.
our
response
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
had
expired.
otherwise
the
case
would
have
been
put
over
the
summer
when
the
court
made
that
decision.
and
i'm
not
here
to
question
the
court's
determination
of
that
question.
i'm
here
to
state
our
contentions
about
what's
involved
in
the
case.
the
rule
of
retrogression,
established
in
beer
v.
united
states
--
and
we've
set
out
the
pertinent
quotation
in
our
brief
at
page
33
--
was
largely
determinative
of
the
outcome
here,
as
the
district
court
analyzed
the
case.
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
rule
was
developed
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
a
question
about
the
effect
of
the
changes
that
were
involved
in
beer,
the
question
of
discriminatory
purpose
had
not
been
reached
by
the
district
court
in
beer,
and
therefore
was
not
before
this
court.
it
was
something
to
be
considered
on
remand
in
beer,
after
this
court's
decision.
so
the
rule
of
retrogression
was
adopted
by
this
court
in
beer,
entirely
in
the
context
of
the
effect
test
under
section
50.
that
was
the
rule
applied
quite
properly
here,
in
our
view,
by
the
district
court.
the
kinds
of
changes
at
issue
here,
particularly
annexations
of
predominantly
white
areas,
and
the
imposition
of
majority
vote
requirements
where
previously
there
had
been
election
by
plurality,
and
the
run-off
elections
that
went
along
with
that,
and
the
imposition
of
staggered
terms
were
all
devices
specifically
mentioned
in
the
committee
report
accompanying
the
1975
extension
of
the
voting
rights
act,
as
devices
threatening
diminution
of
black
voting
strength.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
those,
in
47
of
the
60
annexations,
the
attorney
general
precleared
them
after
that
became
apparent.
and
his
objections
were
interposed
as
to
only
13
of
the
60
annexations
that
had
taken
place.
with
respect
to
those,
there
was
an
addition
of,
i
believe
it
was,
2,000-and-some
white
voters.
we
have
the
figures
in
the
brief.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
very
much,
but
measurably,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
a
total
of
two
percent;
it
was
a
one
percent
increase
in
white
registered
voters,
and
a
one
percent
decrease
in
the
percentage
of
black
registered
voters
for
a
difference
of
two
percent.
we
have
that
set
forth
in
a
lengthy
footnote
in
our
brief,
in
which
we
analyze
the
statistical
evidence
--it's
on
pages
38
and
39
--
a
little
bit
differently
from
the
way
the
district
court
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
tie
in
with
the
holding
in
richmond,
mr.
justice,
but
it
ties
in
even
more
closely
with
the
holding
in
the
city
of
petersburg.
and
in
just
a
moment
x
would
like
to
speak
further
about
the
annexations.
i
just
wanted
to
say
with
respect
to
the
other
changes,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief;
unlike
the
typical
section
5
case,
in
this
case
the
district
court
did
not
have
to
predict
whether
there
would
be
a
retrogressive
effect
as
a
result
of
the
other
changes
because
elections
had
taken
place
for
eight
years
under
those
changes,
without
their
having
been
precleared,
and
in
the
1970
election,
in
which
reverend
hill,
a
black
candidate
to
whom
counsel
for
the
petitioner
referred,
ran
for
office.
he
would
have
been
elected
under
the
old
procedure,
indeed,
arguably,
he
was
elected
since
the
run-off
election
and
the
majority
vote
requirement
had
not
been
precleared
and
were
a
nullity.
but
there
has
been
a
subsequent
election,
so
that
issue
is,
for
practical
purposes,
moot.
but,
arguably,
he
was
elected
because
he
received
a
plurality
in
the
initial
vote,
and
then
was
defeated
in
the
run-off,
in
which
a
majority
vote
was.
required
as
a
result
of
the
change.
so
there
was
no
speculation
required
about
whether
a
retrogressive
effect
was
involved
in
the
changes
at
issue
here.
now,
with
respect
to
the
annexations,
this
case,
in
our
submission,
differs
only
in
degree
and
not
in
any
way
in
principle
from
the
petersburg
case,
which
was
decided
summarily
by
this
court
in
volume
410
u.s.,
and
was
referred
to
extensively
in
the
court's
subsequent
opinion
in
city
of
richmond.
in
affirming
that
judgment,
this
court
necessarily
rejected
petitioner's
basic
statutory
argument
here,
and
implicitly
rejected
his
constitutional
argument
as
well.
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
in
order
to
clarify
this,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
circulate
a
xerox
copy
of
the
motion
to
affirm
that
was
filed
by
the
united
states
in
city
of
petersburg,
and
that
was
granted
by
seven
justices
of
this
court,
all
of
whom
are
present
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
court
does
not
necessarily
affirm
the
reasoning,
and
that
is
why
i
thought
it
wise
to
take
a
look
and
see
whether
there's
some
other
conceivable
basis
for
the
affirmance,
and
why
i'd
like,
if
the
court
please,
to
turn
now
to
pages
6
and
7
of
that
motion
to
affirm,
because
i
think
that
the
government
there
fairly
laid
bare
exactly
what
was
at
issue
in
this
appeal,
based
on
the
findings
that
had
been
made
by
the
district
court
in
the
holding
there.
and
with
the
court's
leave,
i'd
like
to
just
read
a
short
passage
here.
appellant
argues
that
because
the
court
below
found
nothing
in
the
annexation
which
indicated
that
it
had
a
racial
purpose,
judicial
inquiry
in
a
suit
of
this
nature,
into
the
effect
on
the
negro
voter
of
an
extension
of
the
city
limits
into
white
suburbia
is
foreclosed.
the
plain
language
of
section
5,
however,
refutes
this
argument.
and
there
we
quote
that
the
burden
is
to
show
that
the
change
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote.
then
we
say,
the
district
court
therefore
properly
did
not
end
its
inquiry
upon
finding
that
the
petersburg
annexation
was
quote,
"a
necessary
measure
to
allow
the
city
to
expand
its
tax
base
and
its
potential
for
growth
and
development."
it
looked
further
to
ascertain
whether,
as
this
court
stated
in
a
related
context,
designedly
or
otherwise,
the
extension
of
the
city
limits
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
would
operate
to
minimize
or
cancel
out
the
voting
strength
of
racial
elements
of
the
voting
population.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
by
looking
at
this
the
court's
recollection
will
be
refreshed
as
to
precisely
what
was
before
the
court
and
whether
there
was
some
other
basis
on
which
affirmance
was
granted.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
a
large
extent,
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
was
subsequently
endorsed
in
the
city
of
richmond's
opinion.
the
reason
why
this
decision
happens
to
be
more
closely
on
point
is
because
here
the
district
court
denied
preclearance
to
the
annexation,
whereas,
after
appropriate
adjustments
were
made
in
voting
procedures,
this
court
upheld
the
annexation,
and
the
city
of
richmond
applying
what
to
all
appearances
are
precisely
the
same
standards
on
which
this
denial
is
based
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
aware
of
that
difference
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
a
different
finding
here,
which
arguably,
could
make
a
difference
either
in
the
relief
that
would
be
appropriate
or
in
the
finding
of
whether
there
was
a
retrogressive
effect.
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
basic
statutory
constitutional
question,
whether,
having
found
nondiscriminatory
purpose,
indeed
a
purpose
that
is
referred
to
in
one
quotation
we
have
from
the
opinion,
in
a
footnote
on
page
11,
there's
a
compelling
need
for
the
annexation.
the
district
court
nevertheless
was
correct
in
striking
it
down,
because
the
city
did
not
meet
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
nonetheless
did
not
have
an
effect,
in
the
absence
of
ameliorative
changes
in
other
voting
procedures,
in
effect
proscribed
by
the
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
basic
statutory
and
constitutional
contention
that
is
being
made
on
the
other
side
of
this
case,
which
would
require
the
rejection
of
this
affirmance.
and
i
would
just
point
out
that
again
on
pages
10
and
11
we
laid
bare
that
that
was
what
was
at
issue
in
city
of
petersburg.
here
the
diminution
in
the
black
voting
strength
resulting
from
the
annexation,
although
measurable,
was
obviously
less
in
degree,
which
is
why
i
say
the
case
differs
in
degree
but
not
in
principle
from
the
city
of
richmond
case.
and
the
district
court
took
proper
account
of
this
difference
in
degree
in
devising
the
remedy,
or,
that
is,
in
stating
what
remedy
would
be
appropriate
in
order
for
preclearance
to
be
granted.
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
district
court's
opinion
begins
at
page
54b
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
and
there
the
district
court
looks
very
properly
to
the
standards
spelled
out
by
this
court
in
the
city
of
richmond
case.
there
was
a
two-step
analysis.
the
first
was
that
the
court
found
the
impact,
because
we
find
the
impact
on
black
voting
strength
to
be
significant,
a
measurable
retrogressive
impact.
and
we
have
spelled
out
the
magnitude
in
that
lengthy
footnote
in
our
brief.
we
must
inquire
further,
we
must
proceed
to
the
second
step,
whether
the
black
community,
after
the
annexation,
has
a
fair
opportunity
to
obtain
representation
reasonably
commensurate
with
its
post-annexation
numerical
strength,
which
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
standard
adopted
by
this
court
in
city
of
richmond.
and
while
in
both
city
of
richmond
and
petersburg,
a
change
to
single-member
districting
was
required
under
the
facts
of
those
cases,
in
order
to
ameliorate
the
retrogressive
effect
that
the
annexations
would
have,
here
because
the
effect
was
less
extreme
the
court
refused
to
say
that
that
was
the
only
possible
way
of
ameliorating
those
adverse
effects.
and,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
several
alternatives
that
are
open
to
the
city
to
ameliorate
those
effects.
the
other
changes
in
voting
procedures,
particularly
the
change
to
majority
voting
requirement
having
been
eliminated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
attorney
general
no
longer
interposes
an
objection
with
respect
to
the
board
of
education
elections,
no
longer
interposes
an
objection
to
the
annexations
for
that
purpose,
but
only
because
ameliorative
changes
of
one
kind
or
another
should
be
made
with
respect
to
the
city
commissioner
election.
and
we
have
spelled
out
on
pages
40
to
42
of
our
brief
the
three
possibilities
that
are
open
to
the
city
to
provide
an
appropriate
amelioration
under
the
standards
of
city
of
richmond.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
difference
is
because
of
a
residency
requirement
for
city
commission
elections,
which
did
not
exist
under
the
old
procedure
for
the
board
of
education
election.
the
residency
requirement,
in
the
context
here,
was
we
have
explained
in
some
detail
on
page
41,
serves
the
function
of
a
numbered
post
requirement,
and
results
in
head-to-head
contests
that,
in
effect,
results
in
majority
vote
requirements.
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
been
the
effect
of
it.
and
the
residency
requirement
could
either
be
dropped
or
adjusted
to
a
requirement
based
on
the
three
wards
that
were
later
adopted
rather
than
the
nine
wards,
as
we
suggest;
so
as
to
ameliorate
the
adverse
effect
of
adding
this
large
number
of
additional
white
voters
we
have
on
the
pre-existing
numerical
opportunity
that
black
voters
had
to
elect
a
candidate
of
their
choice,
which
was
demonstrated
in
the
1970
election,
when
reverend
hill
did
win
a
plurality
on
the
first
vote.
now,
the
statutory
standard,
as
we
say,
was,
in
our
view,
settled
in
petersburg
and
richmond,
and
certainly
is
described
similarly
in
beer
and
in
other
decisions,
and
has
been
endorsed
by
congress
in
the
committee
reports
with
respect
to
the
re-enactments.
and
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
adopt
those
statutory
standards
was
implicitly
upheld
in
all
of
those
decisions.
starting
with
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
itself.
there
really
have
been
four
decisions
under
the
voting
rights
act
which
show
that
congress
is
not
restrictive
in
adopting
legislative
measures
to
taking
action
against
only
what
could
be
proven
to
be
violations
of
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
is
itself
such
a
decision,
and
has
in
common
with
two
others,
gaston
and
oregon
v.
mitchell,
the
fact
that
the
court
upheld
a
congressional
ban
on
the
use
of
literacy
tests,
in
oregon
v.
mitchell
a
wider
ban;
in
gaston
county
an
application
of
the
ban
to
particular
circumstances
--
upheld
that
ban
despite
the
fact
that
this
court
had
held
in
lassiter
v.
north
carolina
that
the
use
of
literacy
test
was
not
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
or
at
least
had
not
been
proven
to
be
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
such
that
the
court
could
strike
it
down.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
that
case.
but
the
congressional
province
was
not
really
to
overrule
the
court's
holding
in
lassiter,
nor
did
the
court
itself
find
it
necessary
to
re-examine
lassiter;
instead,
i
think
what
the
court
did
in
all
of
these
cases
is
very
well
described,
if
i
may
say
so,
in
a
paragraph
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
oregon
v.
mitchell,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
this
opinion,
which
was
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
this
is
on
page
284
of
400
u.s."because
of
the
justification
for
extending
the
ban
on
literacy
test
to
the
entire
nation,
"--
the
claim
here
was
being
made
by
arizona,
that
the
ban
on
literacy
test
should
not
be
extended
to
it
--
"need
not,
because
of
the
justification
for
extending
the
ban
on
literacy
test
to
the
entire
nation,
need
not
turn
on
whether
literacy
tests
unfairly
discriminate
against
negroes
in
every
state
in
the
union;
congress
was
not
required
to
make
state-by-state
findings
concerning
either
the
equality
of
educational
opportunity
or
actual
impact
of
literacy
requirements
on
the
negro
citizens'
access
to
the
ballot
box.
in
the
interest
of
uniformity,
congress
may
paint
with
a
much
broader
brush
than
may
this
court,
which
must
confine
itself
to
the
judicial
function
of
deciding
individual
cases
and
controversies
upon
individual
records,
compare
lassiter
v.
northampton
election
board."
the
findings
that
congress
made
when
it
enacted
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
would
have
supported
a
nationwide
ban
on
literacy
test.
instead,
at
that
time,
congress
chose
to
limit
its
attention
to
the
geographic
areas
where
immediate
action
seemed
necessary,
quoting
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
experience
gained
under
the
1965
act
has
now
led
congress
to
conclude
that
it
should
go
the
whole
distance.
this
approach
to
the
problem
is
a
rational
one,
consequently,
it
is
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress,
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
the
eight
justices
who
reached
this
question
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
--
mr.
justice
douglas
upheld
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
eight
essentially
agreed
on
this
point,
the
disagreements
were
on
other
points.
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion,
and
the
joint
opinion
of
justices
brennan,
white
and
marshall
were
not
in
disagreement
on
this
basic
point
about
legislative
power.
that
there
need
be
a
rational
nexus
to
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
that
congress
can
paint
with
a
much
broader
brush.
and
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
there
are
really
two
ways
in
which
this
legislation
has
a
rational
nexus.
one
is
the
fact
that
it
applies
in
areas
where
there
is
reason
to
presume
that
in
many,
perhaps
most,
of
the
areas
to
which
it
applies,
there
has
been
purposeful
voting
discrimination,
the
effect
of
which
can
be
perpetuated
by
changes
without
this
prophylactic
device
of
preclearance
provided
for
in
section
5.
and
the
other
is
that
in
light
of
the
findings
of
racial
bloc
voting
that
were
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
changes
can
lend
themselves
to
the
facilitation
and
promotion
of
private
purposeful
discrimination,
and
therefore
are
connected
with
the
principle
of
terry
v.
adams
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
under
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
there
are
two
ways
in
which
there
is
a
wholly
adequate
legislative
nexus
here,
a
rational
nexus
with
purposeful
discrimination.
and
the
case
therefore
falls
well
within
the
principles
this
court
has
previously
settled.
on
the
remaining
point,
we'll
rely
principally
on
our
brief.
it
is
clear
in
our
view
that
the
change
at
issue
here
were
not
precleared
in
1968
at
the
time
of
the
attorney
general
preclearing
the
state
law
which
didn't
make
any
specific
reference
to
rome.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
sheffield
case,
which
we
think
is
controlling
on
this
point,
it
bears
re-emphasizing
at
the
outset
that
the
purpose
of
section
5
is
to
establish
procedures
in
which
voting
changes
can
be
scrutinized
by
a
federal
instrumentality
before
they
become
effective.
and
unless
the
attorney
general's
attention
is
called
to
them,
the
purpose
of
the
act
will
not
be
served;
there
will
be
no
scrutiny.
there
was
no
scrutiny
of
what
changes
would
occur
in
the
city
of
rome.
and,
for
reasons
expressed
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
attorney
general
properly
interpreted
his
regulations
with
respect
to
the
request
for
reconsideration
that
had
been
submitted
to
him,
and
acted
in
a
timely
manner
under
those
regulations.
and
even
if
he
had
not,
he
nonetheless
had
interposed
an
objection
within
the
time
specified
by
the
statute.
and
we
don't
see
why
the
protections
of
the
statute
would
be
abrogated
by
tardiness
under
the
regulations
in
consideration
of
the
request
for
reconsideration.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
for
the
bringing
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
exempt
itself
from
the
coverage
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
provision
is
set
out
on
page
43
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
it
must
show
that
no
test
or
device
has
been
used
during
the
seventeen
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
action
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
within
the
entire
covered
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
question
has
not
been
decided
by
a
court,
but
so
far
as
i'm
aware
that
would
be
the
meaning
of
it,
because
there
is
no
provision
for
piecemeal
bail-outs
which
would
be
for
the
reasons
we
stated
a
very
impractical
way
to
proceed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
act,
of
course,
is
a
temporary
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
extended
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
extended
by
congress
in
1975
to
seven
additional
years,
so
it
presently
expires
in
1982.
of
advocates
of
the
extension
at
many
the
that
time
had
been
advocating
a
ten-year
extension.
the
attorney
general
had
advocated
a
five-year
extension.
congress,
after
lengthy
hearings,
determined
that
seven
years
would
be
the
appropriate
extension,
and
i'm
sure
the
question
will
come
up
again
in
1982.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
city
is
saying
that
the
district
court
erred
in
refusing
to
preclear
its
changes.
it
brought
an
ordinary
preclearance
suit
in
the
district
court.
so
that
that
question
is
also
before
this
court.
those
are
separate
counts
of
the
complaint,
and
the
district
court
reached
them
and
decided
them
against
the
city.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
