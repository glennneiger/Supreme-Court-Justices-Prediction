you
say,
then,
that
section
5
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
permits
congress
to
provide
for
implementation
of
the
proscriptions
of
the
amendment
itself,
but
it
does
not
permit
it
to
enlarge
the
rights
created
by
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
sorry,
i
was
confusing
section
5
with
respect
to
those
things,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
court
has
held
otherwise
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
sufficient
answer
in
those
cases
for
the
state
or
city
to
have
come
back
and
said
the
literacy
test,
although
they
may
have
had
discriminatory
effect,
were
not
discriminatory
in
purpose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
that
that
necessarily
includes
your
constitutional
premise.
supposing
you
were
to
show
that
only
was
the
district
court
correct
in
finding
there
was
no
intent,
but
that
it
was
wrong
in
showing
there
was
no
effect,
that
the
annexations,
for
example,
were
de
minimis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
not
require
any
constitutional
holding
on
our
part.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
true
in
morgan
v.
katzenbach,
though.
the
claim
there
wasn't
purposeful
discrimination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
we
made
a
mistake
in
noting
probable
jurisdiction
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
one
of
your
statements
was
annexation
of
predominantly
white
areas.
as
i
understand
it,
if
one
took
the
population
of
the
area
when
it
was
annexed,
frequently
it
was
virtually
unpopulated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
fairly
well
settled
that
when
we
affirm
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
we
don't
affirm
the
reasoning,
we
simply
affirm
the
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
position
that
although
we
do
not
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
when
we
summarily
affirm
we
adopt
the
statement
of
the
government's
motion
to
affirm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
treat
the
board
of
education
different
from
the
city
commissioners
with
respect
to
annexation?
