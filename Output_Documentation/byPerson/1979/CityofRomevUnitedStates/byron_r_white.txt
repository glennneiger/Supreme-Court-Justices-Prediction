justice

r.

well,
i
thought
it
did,
i
didn't
agree
with
the
court
when
it
did
so,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
case
i'm
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1954
and
specifically
title
vii
thereof
was
enacted
under
the
commerce
clause
power,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
amendments
maybe.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
be,
i
suppose,
under
the
commerce
power,
at
least
arguably.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
nice,
talking
about
the
dissent.
that
was
me.
[laughter.]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
at
least
we
would
be
obliged
to
find
that
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
it's
sort
of
hard
to
refresh
my
recollection,
because
i
wasn't
here;
but
on
page
8
of
your
motion
you
point
out
that
in
that
case
the
majority
white
council
had
been
generally
unresponsive
to
the
expressed
needs
and
desires
of
the
black
community,
and
we
have
a
precisely
opposite
finding
in
this
case,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
difference
could
have
been
critical,
couldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
if
you're
correct
that
the
city
can't
bring
an
action
to
bail
out,
and
we
agree
with
you,
is
the
case
over?
do
we
reach
any
other
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
we
must
reach
the
other
issue?
