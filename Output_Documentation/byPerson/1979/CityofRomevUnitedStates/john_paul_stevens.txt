justice
john
paul
stevens
and
reduction
of
nine
wards
to
three.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
commission
or
council
now
still
elected
at
large
and
still
the
same
number
of
members,
but
requirement
that
they
reside,
some
of
them
reside
in
each
of
the
three
wards;
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
these
annexations
had
been
by
way
of
an
ordinance
or
by
way
of
legislation
in
the
state
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
effect
language
bans
changes
that
took
place
without
discriminatory
purpose,
you
say
that
the
effect
language
is
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
we
have
never
hold
otherwise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
beer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
--
more
fundamentally,
mr.
brinson,
do
you
contend
that
this
particular
constitutional
issue
was
not
decided
in
katzenbach,
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach?
or
are
you
conceding
that
it
was
decided
and
asking
us
to
revisit,
reconsider
that
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
telling
us
now
they
have
changed
circumstances,
which
would
imply
that
you're
conceding
that
this
issue
was
decided
in
katzenbach.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
confuses
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
the
conditions
have
not
been
changed,
you're
telling
us
that
in
any
event
this
is
a
new
question
before
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
change
the
percentage
very
much?
justice
john
paul
stevens
less
than
one
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
ties
in
with
the
holding
in
richmond?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case
in
that
case.
