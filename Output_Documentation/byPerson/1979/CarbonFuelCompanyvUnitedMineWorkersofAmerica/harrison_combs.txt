mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
position
of
the
union
is
that
the
bargaining
history
of
the
contractual
clause
is
in
issue
here,
that
if
the
contentions
of
the
operators
are
accepted
by
this
court
that
it
in
effect
would
rewrite
the
contract
on
which
the
parties
agreed.
the
1950
contract,
the
union
and
the
operators
agreed
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
this
contract,
to
exercise
their
best
efforts
to
available
disciplinary
measures
to
prevent
strikes
or
no
accounts
pending
the
processes
of
grievances.
besides
their
use
of
available
disciplinary
measures
of
the
1952
contract
eliminated
the
best
efforts
and
use
of
disciplinary
measures.
since
1952
and
not
to
the
date
of
the
contractual
provisions
that
are
the
subject
of
this
suit
phrases
to
use
the
best
efforts
to
available
disciplinary
measures
had
been
deleted
from
these
contracts.
it
is
the
position
of
the
union
that
there
is
no
contractual
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
union
with
reference
to
unauthorized
wildcat
strikes.
mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct.
of
course
we
cite
that
there
be
some
reflection
on
the
policy
announced
by
norris-laguardia
with
reference
to
encouraging
collective
bargaining
to
arrive
at
these
contracts.
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
we
do
not
rely
on
norris-laguardia
for
that
purpose;
no.
the
answer
would
be
"no,"
mr.
justice.
the
contractual
provisions
that
are
in
dispute
here
were
the
subject
of
interpretations
by
the
court
from
1955
in
the
haislip
case
on
which
the
fourth
circuit
relied
here
from
1958
and
the
decision
of
this
court
admitted
that
the
contracts
were
negotiated
by
the
parties
with
the
interpretation
of
those
provisions
in
those
contracts.
the
union
was
aware
of
those
court
interpretations
at
the
time
that
these
contracts
were
negotiated.
the
national
labor
policy
of
free
collective
bargaining
sustains
our
arguments
that
forbids
government
dictation
on
the
terms
of
the
agreement
as
set
forth
in
this
court's
case
of
h.
k.
porter
to
mr.
justice
black.
the
union
has
a
general
policy
against
wildcat
strikes
as
shown
in
this
record.
it
tried
actively
to
terminate
them
but
it
is
their
judgment,
the
internal
judgment
on
the
best
means
of
doing
this.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
none
of
this
was
authorized.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
would
say
just
a
bare
showing
that
the
union
had
authorized
that
strike
would
not
be
sufficient.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
would
be
my
argument;
that
is
true.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
would
be
a
subject
of
permissive
bargaining
to
decide
on
what
steps
the
union
would
take
in
its
internal
structure
to
bring
about
these
strikes.
that
would
be
permissive
bargaining.
that
would
be
our
position
on
that.
mr.
harrison
combs
it
does
to
this
extent.
the
judgment
was
based
upon
the
mass
action
of
the
local
union
as
an
entity.
they
did
violate
the
contract
by
refusing
to
arbitrate
an
arbitrable
grievance,
that
was
the
judgment.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
harrison
combs
we
do
not
have
an
explicit
agreement
to
that
effect.
mr.
harrison
combs
to
the
extent
that
if
the
contract
--
if
the
strikes
in
question
here
were
authorized
by
the
union
--
mr.
harrison
combs
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
the
arbitration
provisions
of
grievance
procedure
was
equivalent
to
an
implied
agreement
that
those
disputes
would
be
settled
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
guess
--
mr.
harrison
combs
implied
or
explicit,
there
is
very
little
difference
in
those
two
terms.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
correct.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
correct
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
bargaining
history
and
of
course
the
court
decisions
bear
that
out.
i
would
like
to
go
just
to
some
extent
into
the
bargaining
history.
in
1968
and
1971
these
contract
provided
a
grievance
settline
machinery.
it
provided
for
a
miscellaneous
clause.
these
are
the
contracts
suited
by
here.
and
i
disagree
with
counsel
to
the
extent
in
his
answer
that
this
was
ratified
by
the
membership.
it
was
not
at
that
time.
i
would
like
to
go
just
briefly
into
the
methods
by
which
these
contracts
were
bargained
in
1968
and
1971
and
in
the
times
past
on
that.
the
international
union
referred
to
here
has
to
do
with
the
international
convention.
that
convention
was
represented
by
delegates
from
of
the
local
unions
from
the
members.
that
convention
sets
up
a
policy
committee
that
includes
representation
from
each
of
the
districts.
it
involves
some
21
at
this
time.
that
the
members
vote
in
this
policy
committee
is
given
the
authority
under
the
convention
to
negotiate
these
contracts.
the
districts
are
not
parties
to
the
contract,
neither
the
local
union
per
se.
they
represent
on
the
policy
committee
the
membership
of
that
policy
committee
and
once
the
policy
committee
which
consisted
at
that
time
of
175
or
200
members,
that
policy
committee
made
the
contracts
and
executed
and
authorized
them.
they
were
not
ratified
by
the
membership
at
that
time.
in
1941
the
contract
provided
specifically
in
the
settlement
of
disputes,
the
arbitration
clause,
that
pending
the
settlement
of
those
disputes
that
there
should
be
no
cessation
of
work.
that
was
in
the
1941
contract
and,
in
addition,
the
1941
contract
contained
miscellaneous
provision
that
was
bargained
side
by
side
to
the
effect
that
an
illegal
stoppage
of
work
was
a
violation
of
the
contract.
two
provisions.
those
contracts
were
carried
forward
through
negotiations
up
until
1947
at
which
time
the
taft-hartley
act
became
effective.
the
union
negotiated
in
collective
bargaining
with
the
operators
did
delete
from
the
arbitration
machinery
the
cessation
of
work
clause
in
the
arbitration.
they
also
negotiated
in
a
miscellaneous
clause
that
all
the
no-strike
penalty
and
work
stoppage
clauses
would
be
canceled,
made
nul
and
void
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
union
argued
that
it
would
not
be
responsible
and
couldn't
be
responsible
for
the
spontaneous,
unauthorized
walk
out
strikes.
that
was
in
1947.
there
were
contracts
negotiated
between
1950
and
in
the
1950
contract
again
by
negotiating
parties
--
by
the
parties
--
the
1950
contract
contained
clauses
to
the
effect
that
the
parties
--
both
of
them
--
would
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
clause
in
the
contract
through
disciplinary
measures
to
see
that
the
grievance
machinery
was
carried
out
and
that
there
be
no
strikes.
because
of
criticism,
which
is
stated
in
the
record,
the
difficulty
the
union
had
of
internal
discipline
of
its
members,
that
was
eliminated
in
1942,
deleted
from
the
integrity
clause,
and
only
the
integrity
clause
was
left.
now,
from
1952
up
until
the
present
day
that
term
has
been
deleted
specifically
and
the
miscellaneous
clause
is
carried
on
through.
mr.
harrison
combs
our
position
would
be
the
same
insofar
as
authorizing
the
strikes
because
because
of
the
international
union.
mr.
harrison
combs
no;
no,
your
honor,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
with
reference
to
--
mr.
harrison
combs
their
opinion
was
based
upon
the
contract
in
which
they
said
that
the
bargaining
history
of
the
clause
and
the
construction
of
it
was
such
that
there
was
no
contractual
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
do
anything.
they
didn't
say
that
the
union
could
authorize,
specifically
instruct,
and
there
is
no
evidence
as
counsel
said
here,
whatsoever
that
the
union
had
anything
to
do
with
authorizing
those
strikes
or
participating
in
them
or
condoning
them.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
1955
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
haislip
case
construing
the
same
type
of
provision
in
the
contract,
held
through
judge
parker
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
do
anything
with
reference
to
these
unauthorized
wildcat
strikes
and
that
the
record
showed
that
the
union
had
--
that
the
operators
had
called
the
union
in,
the
union
representatives
to
help
them
settle
the
strikes
and
that
the
union
had
done
so.
that
occurred
in
this
case.
this
court
upheld
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
benedict
coal
company
case
mr.
justice
stewart
speaking
for
the
sixth
circuit
at
that
time
as
a
judge
of
that
court,
stated
that
the
language
if
the
1952
contract
relieved
the
union
--
the
national
union
from
any
obligation
for
spontaneous,
unauthorized
strikes.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
basically
the
same
thing.
now,
in
the
light
of
those
court
opinions
these
contracts
were
negotiated
by
the
parties
in
1952,
1954,
1956,
58,
'64,
'68
and
'71.
all
those
contracts
were
negotiated
in
the
light
of
those
court
decisions
including
the
provisions
that
they
are
claiming
here.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
pointed
out
--
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
and
that
is
correct
--
the
court
pointed
out,
the
fourth
circuit
did
that
the
cases
in
the
third
circuit,
u.s.
steel,
republic,
that
it
was
their
opinion
that
the
effect
of
those
cases
were
to
rewrite
the
contract
and
that
they
disagreed
with
them.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
are
in
agreement
on
the
interpretation
of
these
various
provisions
we
are
talking
about
here
and
in
of
course
the
benedict
coal
company
case.
it
is
the
position
of
the
union
here
that
is
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
this
question
of
discipline
is
a
question
of
judgement
and
with
all
due
respect
to
opposing
counsel
in
their
brief
they
point
out
the
difficulties
in
the
company
trying
to
exercise
discipline
themselves.
they
point
out
if
a
fireman
might
have
got
the
whole
crowd
on
their
hands
or
sometimes
their
old
route
and
it
raises
ill
feeling
among
the
members,
their
employees
simply
it
is
not
sufficient
for
disciplinary
action.
now,
we
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
at
the
bargaining
table
and
in
this
record
say
approximately
the
same
thing,
that
these
employees
of
these
companies
are
hired
by
the
company,
they
fired
by
the
company,
they
are
directed
by
the
company
and
if
the
company
says
it
will
cause
too
much
hard
feeling
and
be
too
harsh
to
fire
these
people,
the
union
says
on
the
other
hand
that
we
take
the
charter
away
from
this
local
union
and
probably
spread
to
other
local
unions,
and
certainly
they
don't
want
that.
in
union
procedure,
the
union,
its
constitution
and
law,
it
is
very
strict
on
the
trusteeships.
it
takes
an
extended
period
of
hearings,
it
takes
extended
reports
and
it
requires
a
long
time
to
take
a
charter
away
from
a
local
union.
in
addition
to
that,
they
talk
about
disciplining
a
member.
that
member
has
a
right
under
the
landrum-griffin
act
and
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
he
has
a
right
of
notice
to
what
he
is
charged
with.
he
has
the
right
to
prepare
his
case
to
be
heard.
he
would
be
tried
in
his
own
local
union.
that
would
be
where
the
trial
would
be
held.
he
has
the
protection
of
going
through
appeals
in
the
union
in
6
or
8
months
perhaps
after
the
strike.
maybe
the
discipline
might
be
finished
and
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
and
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
union
that
disciplinary
action
is
not
something
that
would
protect
either
the
union
or
the
operators
in
stopping
these
strikes,
that
their
judgment
has
been
negotiated
on
since
1941
up
to
date.
and
i
might
say
that
the
reason
for
the
111-day
strike,
the
top
thing
on
the
agenda
of
the
negotiators
was
the
question
about
these
unauthorized
strikes.
if
the
court
please,
it
has
long
been
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
laws
to
encourage
collective
bargaining
as
a
means
of
lessening
industrial
strife
and
promoting
industrial
peace.
we
think
this
applies
to
all
unions
and
all
employers
in
this
country;
that
is
the
policy
enunciated
by
the
congress.
justice
black
stated
in
the
porter
company
v.
nlrb
that
the
basic
theme
of
the
labor
act
was
that
through
collective
bargaining
the
passions,
the
arguments
and
struggles
of
prior
years
would
be
channeled
into
constructive,
open
discussions
leading
it
was
hoped
to
mutual
agreement.
but,
it
was
recognized
from
the
beginning
that
some
cases
would
be
impossible
and
it
was
never
intended
that
the
government
would
in
such
cases
step
in
and
become
a
party
to
the
negotiations
and
impose
its
own
views.
that
is
this
court
speaking
in
1970.
we
feel
strongly
that
for
this
international
union
to
be
held
liable
for
work
stoppage
which
it
neither
authorized,
condoned
or
ratified,
that
this
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
labor
policy
of
promoting
collective
bargaining
and
would
seriously
undermine
the
collective
bargaining
rights
and
industrial
strife
between
the
parties
may
be
increased.
mr.
harrison
combs
if
the
court
please,
we
read
that
on
page
19
and
20
of
the
brief
and
it
cites
--
the
united
states
district
court
of
appeals
for
d.c.
stated
it
well,
recites
that
the
thrust
of
the
whole
thing
is
this
both
parties
admit
constantly
since
1941
they
negotiated
this,
they
wanted
to
settle
with
us
by
collective
bargaining.
that
is
what
the
integrity
laws
mean,
that
they
would
exercise
the
best
collective
bargaining
that
could
bring
about
this
settlement.
but
at
no
time
were
they
arguing
at
that
time
that
the
union
would
be
liable
for
unauthorized
spontaneous
strikes.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
it
is
clearly
established
--
it
was
clearly
established
that
the
elimination
of
the
disciplinary
and
the
best
efforts
clauses
were
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
union
from
being
held
liable
for
something
that
could
admit
trouble.
that
was
understood.
and
to
say
that
the
integrity
clause
had
the
same
meaning
we
think
stretches
the
imagination
and
we
don't
think
it
conforms
to
common,
ordinary
reasoning.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
what
it
says
specifically
is
that
they
will
maintain
both
sides,
will
maintain
the
integrity
of
this
agreement
and
it
is
to
be
--
these
matters
are
to
be
settled
by
collective
bargaining
without
recourse
to
the
courts.
that
is
what
it
says.
and
i
think
that
a
lot
of
times
in
the
courts
that
it
is
forgotten.
it
states
the
purpose
in
there
itself.
it
says
that
this
is
to
be
settled
--
these
matters
by
collective
bargaining
without
recourse
to
the
courts.
that
is
what
the
clause
says.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
right.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
to
answer
your
question
i
think
when
you
talk
about
arbitration
both
sides
agree
we
will
do
our
obligation
to
arbitration.
but
i
think
the
company
would
say
that
that
doesn't
mean
they
could
not
bring
out
if
they
wanted
to
whatever
matter
they
wanted
to.
we
are
talking
about
strikes
and
knock
outs
when
we
are
talking
about
the
liability
of
the
union
in
there,
we
are
talking
about
strikes
and
knock
outs;
we
are
not
talking
about
arbitration.
we
accept
the
fact
that
if
the
local
union
refuses
to
go
through
arbitration
and
the
international
and
it
is
authorized,
that
that
is
the
implied
agreement
held
by
this
court
that
it
would
arbitrate
it.
but
certainly
don't
think
that
the
integrity
clause
is
equivalent.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
take
affirmative
steps.
i
think
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
union
under
the
implied
agreement
had
authorized
these
strikes
and
said,
