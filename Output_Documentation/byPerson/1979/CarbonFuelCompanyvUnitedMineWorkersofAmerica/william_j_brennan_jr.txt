justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
a
suit
against
an
internation
union,
united
mine
workers
of
america
against
district
17,
a
regional
subdivision
of
the
international
and
against
three
local
mine
workers
unions.
the
suit
seeks
damages
suffered
by
the
petitioner,
carbon
fuel
company,
resulting
from
some
50
unauthorized
or
wildcat
strikes
engaged
in
by
the
local
unions
of
carbon
fuel's
several
coal
mines
in
west
virginia.
a
jury
awarded
separate
verdicts
for
damages
against
all
of
the
defendants.
the
court
of
appeals
modified
and
as
modified,
affirmed
the
verdicts
against
the
local
unions,
but
the
court
set
aside
the
awards
against
the
international
union
and
district
17,
and
remanded
to
the
trial
court
with
direction
to
dismiss
the
case
against
those
defendants.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
neither
in
law
nor
by
implication
from
the
terms
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
between
carbon
fuel
and
the
international,
was
there
any
duty
on
the
part
of
the
international
or
district
17,
which
carbon
fuel
contended,
to
use
all
reasonable
means
available
to
them
to
prevent
the
wildcat
strikes
or
bring
about
their
termination.
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
liability
of
those
defendants
could
be
found
only
upon
evidence
that
the
international
and
or
the
district
instigated,
supported,
ratified
or
encouraged
the
strikes
since
carbon
fuel
had
preferred
--
proffered
no
such
evidence.
the
verdicts
against
the
international
and
district
17,
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
stand.
we
agree
and
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
