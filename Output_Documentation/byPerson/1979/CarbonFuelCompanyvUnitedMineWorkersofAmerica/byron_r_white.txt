did
they
dispute
the
representation
of
the
district
representatives
in
doing
that?

mr.
coombs,
would
you
have
a
different
position
of
the
contract
had
a
no-strike
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
just
a
bare
no-strike
clause
would
not
carry
with
it
an
obligation
to
take
affirmative
efforts
to
stop
wildcat
strikes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
an
integrity
clause
wouldn't
add
anything
to
that,
i
take
it
you
argue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
doesn't
carry
with
it
any
promise
to
take
any
affirmative
steps.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
integrity
clause
can't
add
another
promise.
justice

arguably
it
could
mean
if
you
just
read
the
words
that
neither
party
will
attempt
to
add
any
provisions
to
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
argue
without
the
integrity
clause
the
international
would
be
liable.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
there
is
no
integrity
clause
but
there
was
an
expressed
no
strike
clause
--
just
a
simple
no
strike
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
effect
then
you
say
the
integrity
clause
doesn't
add
a
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
just
expresses
what
is
already
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
at
the
same
time
they
eliminated
an
express
undertaking.
justice

well,
was
this
the
third
circuit's
position,
was
the
third
circuit's
position
the
same
as
yours
that
the
case
would
be
the
same
without
the
integrity
clause?
