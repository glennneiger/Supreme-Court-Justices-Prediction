mr.
david
d.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
carbon
like
all
the
other
employer
members
of
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association
is
required
by
law
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
the
international
union
umwa
is
the
exclusive
union
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
all
the
operators
including
carbon.
all
the
employees
are
members
of
the
international
as
distinguished
from
separately
its
subordinate
branches.
the
international
bargains
and
negotiates
the
contracts.
it
comes
to
the
bargaining
table
holding
itself
out
as
able
to
speak
for
all
of
its
members
in
support
of
the
branches
and
to
commit
them
to
the
promises
that
it
makes
in
the
bargaining.
the
international
by
its
constitution
has
supreme
legislative,
executive
and
judicial
authority
over
all
of
its
members
and
its
subordinate
branches.
however,
the
umw
has
structured
itself
into
a
three-tiered
organization
with
the
international
union
at
the
top,
the
districts
in
the
middle
with
jurisdiction
in
particular
geographic
areas,
and
the
locals
at
the
bottom
with
jurisdiction
in
particular
mines
or
companies.
the
union
has
also
unilaterally
structured
itself
in
such
a
way
that
the
local
unions
at
the
bottom
of
the
tier
are
at
carbon
and
generally
elsewhere
judgment
proof
against
the
satisfaction
of
substantial
judgments
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
no,
i
think
that
when
i
say
unilaterally
i
mean
the
union
has
control
over
its
internal
structure
and
that
is
very
similar
to
many
corporations
or
business
forms.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
this
international
union
makes,
signs
and
enters
into
the
contract,
it
is
the
bargaining
representative
party
of
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association
members
are
parties
to
the
contract
on
the
employers'
side
of
the
table.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
the
districts
i
believe
sign
the
contract
as
well
as
the
international.
they
have
a
organization
which
is
established
by
the
international
union
to
bargain
the
contract
and
the
district
and
the
locals
participate
to
the
extent
that
the
international
permits
them
to
do
so.
and
i
believe
that
the
districts
sign
the
contract
as
well
as
the
international.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
i
think
they
are
parties.
i
would
the
position
that
they
are
parties
to
the
contract
in
the
sense
that
that
is
the
locals,
the
districts
and
the
international
are
all
parties
to
the
contract
in
the
sense
that
they
all
benefit
from
it,
accept
the
benefits
of
it,
and
i
would
say
they
are
bound
by
it.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
that
is
right.
strictly
speaking
in
that
sense,
i
don't
think
that
the
district
and
the
locals
are
parties
to
the
contract.
the
international
is
the
party
to
the
contract
and
they
are
all
bound
by
the
contract.
the
district
is
a
subdivision
of
the
international,
acts
as
its
agent
with
respect
to
certain
functions
under
the
contract.
and
the
locals
also
have
jurisdiction
based
upon
particular
mines
and
locals
and
they
are
bound
by
the
contract
but
they
are
not
parties
to
the
contract.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
the
contract
is
ratified
by
the
membership
submitted
to
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
sir?
mr.
david
d.
johnson
it
is
binding
upon
them
and
they
ratify
it.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
i
think
certainly
they
are.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
they
could
enforce
it
by
suit,
they
can
--
they
are
bound
by
it,
they
have
the
benefits
of
it,
they
are
obligated
to
comply
with
it.
out
of
this
collective
bargaining
arrangement
the
employer
carbon
and
other
operators
have
obtained
a
commitment
from
the
international
union
to
settle
all
disputes
and
differences
that
arise
between
the
employer
and
the
employees
and
the
union
during
the
life
of
the
agreement
through
a
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
rather
than
by
strikes
and
work
stoppages.
that
commitment
consists
of
two
elements.
one
of
them
is
the
agreed
procedure
itself
leading
to
binding
arbitration.
the
other
is
a
specific
commitment
that
the
parties
agree
and
affirm
that
they
will
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
contract
and
that
all
disputes
and
claims
which
are
not
settled
by
agreement
shall
be
settled
by
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
provided.
and
this
court
in
gateway
coal
company
v.
united
mine
workers
held
that
that
constituted
a
binding
implied
no-strike
clause.
it
is
of
course
the
policy
of
our
national
labor
policy
as
expressed
in
the
federal
labor
laws
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
particularly
commitments
of
this
sort
to
settle
during
the
life
of
the
contract
by
binding
arbitration
shall
be
enforceable
and
shall
not
be
permitted
to
become
or
to
be
illusory.
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
law
expression
a
federal
policy
that
the
court
should
enforce
these
agreements
on
behalf
of
or
against
labor
organizations
in
order
to
bring
about
industrial
peace
and
stability
during
the
life
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
other
provisions
of
the
act
evidence
such
same
policy.
section
204(a)
states
that
employers
and
employees
shall
exert
every
reasonable
effort
not
only
to
make
but
to
maintain
agreements
made
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
despite
that
binding
no-strike
commitment
in
the
coal
contracts
there
were
during
the
period
of
time
covered
by
this
case
31
strikes
at
the
mines
of
carbon
alone
over
issues
that
were
arbitrable
under
the
contract.
the
record
shows
that
in
the
area
of
the
coal
operators
association
in
southern
west
virginia
of
which
carbon
is
a
member,
during
the
same
period
of
time
there
were
literally
hundreds
of
such
strikes
and
more
than
a
thousand
mine-days
of
work
were
lost
over
these
disputes
that
it
had
been
agreed
would
be
settled
peacefully
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
these
strikes
were
not
authorized
by
the
international
or
district
unions.
in
each
case
the
district
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
international
sent
representatives
to
the
local
unions
who
informed
meetings
of
the
local
that
the
strike
was
disavowed
and
not
authorized
and
instructed
the
men
to
return
to
work.
although
they
repeated
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
they
acted
in
anything
but
good
faith.
that
is
to
say
they
wanted
the
men
to
return
to
work,
and
there
was
nod
nor
wink
nor
anything
of
that
sort
indicating
the
contrary.
but
repeatedly
they
stuck
to
the
same
routine
without
any
results
and
although
they
threatened
repeatedly
to
use
the
other
means
that
they
had
available
to
them
to
stop
the
strikes,
none
of
those
mans
that
they
referred
to
or
that
they
threatened
to
use
were
ever
utilized
by
them.
their
position
was
and
has
been
that
they
had
no
obligation
to
do
anything
more
than
they
did
and
of
course
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
they
had
no
obligation
and
have
no
obligation
to
do
anything.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
well,
it
gets
different
i
think
that
our
case
against
the
international
is
stronger
let
us
say
in
the
sense
because
the
district
is
in
the
context
of
this
case
acting
as
an
agent
acting
for
the
international.
the
vacant
commitment
is
by
the
international
union
but
the
liability
of
the
locals
in
this
case,
which
is
not
an
issue
in
here,
was
predicated
on
the
mass
action
theory
that
all
of
the
members
of
the
local
went
on
strike
when
the
mines
went
on
strike,
including
the
officers;
and
that
therefore
it
represented
the
action
of
the
union.
in
that
sense
it
is
different.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
the
district
was
in
trusteeship
throughout
most
but
not
all
of
the
period
of
time
that
we
are
involved
with
here.
that
is
to
say
the
international
had
take
it
over
in
trusteeship
and
appointed
the
officers
of
the
district
during
most
of
the
period.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
no
disciplinary
measures
were
taken
at
carbon's
mine
nor
so
far
as
the
record
indicates
any
mines
in
the
coal
operators
association.
nor
--
it
is
just
a
matter
of
discipline.
the
record
shows
that
the
union
has
a
variety
of
means
that
it
can
use
to
attempt
induce
or
coerce
compliance
with
the
no-strike
clause
including
disciplinary
action
not
only
against
members
but
against
the
local
as
such
--
finds
against
the
local
--
removal
of
the
officers
of
a
local,
improvision
of
a
provisional
government
for
the
local,
and
many
things
which
are
not
spelled
out
in
the
constitution
but
i
think
are
inherent
in
it
such
as
giving
the
members
instructions
that
a
picket
line
is
not
authorized,
that
they
should
cross
the
picket
line
or
that
they
should
remain
at
work
despite
the
picket
line
because
the
picket
line
is
contrary
to
union
policy.
none
of
these
things
were
ever
done,
including
any
disciplinary
action.
our
proposition
basically
is
that
the
situation
that
exists
here
as
shown
in
this
case
under
the
coal
contract
is
wholly
incompatible
with
and
in
conflict
with
the
national
labor
policy
enunciated
by
this
court
to
give
meaning
and
effect
to
no-strike
commitments
in
contracts
during
the
life
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
and
not
to
permit
them
to
become
illusory
and
meaningless.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
it
is
an
action
for
damages,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
it
is
an
action
for
damages
against
the
international
district
unions
as
well
as
the
locals,
but
that
issue
is
not
here,
for
their
failure
to
use
the
reasonable
means
available
to
them
to
prevent
breaches
of
contract
by
their
members
and
subordinate
branches,
specifically
breaches
of
the
no-strike
clause
of
the
contract.
and
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
well,
the
arbitration
clause
--
of
course
when
i
speak
of
the
no-strike
clause
i
am
speaking
of
the
commitment
in
the
contract
that
all
disputes
will
be
settled
through
our
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
rather
than
by
strikes.
the
language
which
this
court
held
in
the
gateway
case
would
constitute
a
binding,
no-strike
clause.
now,
our
proposition
simply
is
that
both
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
law,
the
national
labor
policy
is
to
make
such
agreements
effective
and
prevent
them
from
becoming
illusory
and
common,
ordinary
principles
of
traditional
contract
law
require
that
their
be
implied
in
the
no-strike
clause
an
obligation
upon
the
part
of
the
international
and
district
unions
to
use
reasonable
means
available
to
them
to
stop
and
prevent
strikes
by
their
members
and
subordinate
branches.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
1950
there
was
written
into
the
contract
a
specific
provision.
in
addition
to
the
maintain
the
integrity
clause
of
the
contract
on
which
we
really
we
say
that
even
if
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
that
national
labor
policy
and
ordinary
principles
of
contract
law
don't
require
the
imposition
or
the
implication
of
all
reasonable
means
obligation,
that
in
this
particular
contract
with
its
particular
language,
specifically
the
obligation
of
the
parties
expressly
stated
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
contract
and
that
all
disputes
and
differences
shall
be
settled
through
the
grievance
procedures
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
the
language
--
the
specific
language
referred
to
was
in
addition
to
the
maintain
the
integrity
clause
language.
the
1950
agreement
used
the
words
"and"
exercise
their
best
efforts
to
the
available
disciplinary
measures
to
prevent
work
stoppages.
that
was
deleted
from
the
contract
in
1952
and
the
fourth
circuit
relied
upon
that
deletion
as
meaning
that
there
was
no
remaining
obligation
to
--
or
no
intended
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
international
union'
reasonable
means
to
stop
strikes.
we
think
that
that
was
error,
it
was
error
for
several
reasons.
one
of
them
is
that
it
gives
no
meaning
or
significance,
doesn't
explain
why
the
maintain
the
integrity
language
was
retained
in
the
contract
and
had
remained
in
it
to
the
present
time.
and
secondly,
the
bargaining
history
the
court
relied
on
which
was
that
stated
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
international
union
v.
umw
is
incompletely
and
inaccurately
stated
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
that
case.
the
full
and
accurate
bargaining
history
is
set
forth
in
the
nlrb
case
which
was
a
subject
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
known
as
the
boone
county
case
in
117
nlrb
and
it
appears
in
the
bargaining
history
set
forth
fully
in
that
case
but
the
language
that
we
are
referring
to
was
deleted
in
1952
not
because
the
international
union
objected
to
doing
something
about
strikes
or
attempting
to
take
some
action
to
stop
strikes
by
its
subordinate
branches
but
because
it
objected
to
being
required
to
use
discipline
in
every
case
whether
it
was
reasonable
in
a
specific
case
or
not.
and
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
also
like
the
district
of
columbia
court
on
which
it
relied
fails
utterly
to
take
note
of
the
fact
that
in
1947
when
taft-hartley
was
passed
the
union
did
several
things
with
a
contract
to
protect
against
financial
lability.
one
of
them
was
it
deleted
the
expressed
no-strike
clause.
this
court
in
gateway
said
that
that
deletion
was
not
sufficient
to
destroy
the
no-strike
commitment
but
the
important
thing
was
what
language
remained,
as
in
this
case
the
maintain
the
integrity
language.
but
they
deleted
the
no-strike
clause
in
1947
and
they
also
wrote
into
the
contract
and
the
bargaining
history
in
the
boone
county
case
recites
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
them
of
financial
responsibility
for
a
strike.
they
wrote
into
the
contract
the
"willing
and
able"
clause
which
said
in
effect
the
miners
would
work
when
they
were
willing
and
able
to
do
so,
they
would
have
no
obligation
to
work
otherwise
and
that
the
union
would
have
no
obligation
to
try
to
make
them
work
or
to
get
them
to
work.
the
bargaining
history
in
the
boone
county
case
further
shows
that
after
two
years
with
that
language
the
operators
came
back
into
the
negotiations
in
1952
and
--
or
in
19500
after
--
it
was
1947
that
language
went
in
and
in
1950
they
came
into
the
negotiations
and
negotiated
out
the
"willing
and
able"
clause
for
the
purpose,
for
the
stated
avowed
purpose
in
negotiations
of
reestablishing
the
union's
financial
responsibility
for
wildcat
because
it
had
a
wave
of
such
strikes
under
the
"willing
and
able"
clause.
all
of
this
language
is
overlooked,
not
referred
to
at
all
of
its
bargaining
history
in
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
because
that
court
relied
upon
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decision
which
incorrectly
and
incompletely
stated
what
appears
in
the
findings
of
fact
which
were
not
rejected
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
boone
county
case.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
"maintain
the
integrity
clause
remains
in
the
contract
to
this
day,
committing
the
international
union
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
contract.
our
position
is
that
that
is
a
commitment
to
an
affirmative
action,
it
is
a
commitment
to
take
all
reasonable
means
to
try
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
no-strike
clause
and
that
no
other
meaning,
no
other
reasonable
meaning
can
be
attributed
to
it
but
exactly
that.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
say
a
little
bit
furthermore
about
the
meeting
of
the
integrity
clause
which
your
honors
have
raised.
of
course
the
third
circuit
has
held
that
the
commitment
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
contract
that
all
disputes
shall
be
settled
in
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
in
the
words
of
the
court
necessarily
embraces
an
obligation
to
use
all
reasonable
means
to
enforce
or
uphold.
mr.
david
d.

you
are
referring
to
the
eazor
express
case
or
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
the
united
states
steel
case?
mr.
david
d.
johnson
well,
my
recollection
is
that
in
that
case
they
said
the
maintaining
integrity
clause
necessarily
embraces
an
all
reasonable
means
obligation
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
only
means
that
can
reasonably
be
attributed
to
it.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
all
reasonable
means
obligation
embraces
both
an
obligation
to
try
to
prevent
strikes
when
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
strikes
will
occur
and
an
obligation
to
stop
them
or
to
try
to
stop
them
when
they
do
occur,
and
that
it
is
twofold.
of
course
the
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
that
is
right.
it
means
that
there
are
reasonable
of
course
is
a
question
of
fact
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
resolved
by
the
jury
in
this
case.
but
the
means
that
are
reasonable,
what
constitutes
all
reasonable
means
in
any
given
case
is
of
course
going
to
depend
upon
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
strike.
and
one
of
those
factors
is,
when
did
the
union
get
notice
of
it.
when
did
they
have
an
opportunity
to
act.
and
in
this
case
the
jury
awards
damages
i
think
leads
you
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
the
jury
didn't
find
the
international
union
liable
from
the
commencement
of
each
strike
but
from
such
point
as
the
jury
determined
they
should
have
acted
and
had
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
act.
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
integrity,
some
light
may
be
cast
upon
it
by
the
fact
that
one
of
the
several
directives
that
the
international
union
issued
to
its
members
in
locals
between
1951
and
1966
telling
them
that
these
strikes
were
unauthorized,
that
they
were
a
problem
for
the
union
and
calling
upon
the
locals
and
their
officers
to
act
against
them,
in
one
of
those
it
refers
specifically
to
the
fact
that
the
strikes
--
wildcat
strikes
that
were
occurring
in
the
locals
threatened
the
integrity
of
the
joint
bargaining
relationship
--
contractual
relationship
between
the
operators
and
the
union.
i
don't
--
i
submit
respectfully
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
integrity
clause
is
directly
related
to
the
immediately
following
commitment
to
settle
all
disputes
through
contract
grievances
and
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
our
position
is
that
the
international
is
liable
because
there
is
inherent
in
the
--
well,
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
my
position
would
be
your
honor,
that
whether
there
is
an
expressness
strike
clause
or
whether
there
is
an
implied
no
strike
clause,
whether
the
specific
maintain
the
integrity
language
is
used
or
not,
that
there
is
inherent
in
the
no
strike
promise
under
our
national
labor
policy
and
the
implied
commitment
that
the
union
that
makes
that
promise
will
use
the
reasonable
means
available
to
it
to
prevent
its
subordinate
branches
and
its
member
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
i
say
that
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
you
--
mr.
david
d.
johnson
i
think
that
that
is
essentially
true.
i
think
that
the
parties
were
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
obligation
unless
they
wrote
it
in
there.
they
wrote
it
in
there.
of
course
you
had
on
the
books
at
that
time
a
number
of
decisions
which
certainly
made
it
doubtful
whether
or
not
they
would
have
such
an
implied
commitment
unless
they
expressly
set
it
forth.
and
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
wrote
the
integrity
clause
in
there
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
intent
of
making
sure
that
the
international
union
would
act
affirmatively
and
diligently
to
try
to
stop
and
prevent
the
wildcat
strike
from
going
on.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
that
is
correct.
the
union
argued
in
gateway
you
know
that
the
deletion
of
the
no-strike
clause
had
relieved
them
from
any
no-strike
obligation.
this
court
has
stated,
your
honor,
that
the
important
thing,
the
significant
thing
was
not
the
language
that
had
been
deleted
but
the
language
that
had
been
retained,
a
commitment
to
settle
all
disputes
through
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
it
is
my
reading
of
the
third
circuit's
decision
that
that
they
say
the
national
labor
policy
and
the
fundamental
principles
of
contract
law
require
a
reasonable
effort
by
the
international
union
and
that
the
maintain
the
integrity
clause
vitiates
the
union's
argument
that
the
parties
did
not
intend
any
such
obligation.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
i
think
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
national
labor
policy
to
go
that
far.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
no,
your
honor,
the
court
of
course
long
ago
said
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
federal
courts
in
developing
substantive
law
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
law
to
develop
law
to
give
effect
to
the
national
labor
policy
expressed
in
those
laws.
mr.
david
d.
johnson
no,
but
it
says
very
clearly,
your
honor,
that
the
labor
policy
is
to
make
collective
bargaining
agreements
enforceable
and
particularly
commitments
to
settle
disputes
peacefully
during
the
last
contract
and
grievance
procedure.
and
therefore
when
the
parties
agree
on
a
no-strike
clause
and
say
this
is
the
way
we
will
settle
prior
disputes
during
the
life
of
the
agreement,
the
party
that
makes
that
agreement
is
under
an
obligation
to
prevent
its
breach.
