justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
agreed
no
disciplinary
measures
were
ever
taken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
combs,
the
judgment
here
against
the
local
union
as
i
understand
it.
and
it
is
it
correct
--
i
want
to
ask
you
-
does
the
judgment
against
the
local
rest
at
all
on
this
provision
of
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
in
effect
there
was
a
direct
violation
of
the
implied
no-strike
commitment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
combs,
you
are
not
asking
us
to
reconsider
our
cases
that
say
that
a
no-strike
clause
is
implied
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
combs,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
litigation
in
the
third
circuit
republic
steel
litigation.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
judge
aldersert's
opinion
in
that
case
really
relied
kind
of
on
public
policy
rather
than
strict
interpretation
of
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
case
went
back.
did
the
jury
hold
the
international
liable
for
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
it
has
not
been
tried
yet;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
really
means
to
prevent
the
strike
in
the
first
place,
they
mixed
the
local
and
the
district
and
the
international
on
the
same
litigation,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
second
one
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah
--
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
all
reasonable
means
to
prevent
a
strike
from
starting
or
to
end
once
it
started?
there
is
a
little
difference
between
the
theory
of
the
mass
action
theory
which
i
guess
makes
the
union
liable
for
--
in
effect
for
the
strike
itself.
and
then
your
theory
here
is
that
there
is
sort
of
a
second
obligation
to
get
the
strike
over
as
fast
as
you
can
if
it
starts
without
authorization
of
the
union
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
manner
half
we
have
got
involved
here,
of
course.
