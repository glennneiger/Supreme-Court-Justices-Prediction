justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnson,
did
you
say
the
union
has
unilaterally
structured
itself.
is
that
any
different
than
say
mobil
oil
company
deciding
instead
of
operating
a
particular
business
as
a
subsidiary
of
mobil
as
a
corporation
it
would
spin
off
and
have
another
corporation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
say
a
shareholder
in
a
corporation
is
a
party
to
a
contract
which
only
the
corporation
has
signed
it
just
because
a
shareholder
will
ultimately
benefit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
case
is
stronger
or
weaker
against
the
district,
the
international
or
the
locals
respectively,
or
is
it
the
same
against
all
of
them
legally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
in
effect
an
action
for
a
specific
performance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
failing
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
arbitration
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
there
during
the
period
from
around
1950
a
specific
clause
in
the
agreement
to
that
effect
which
was
later
dropped?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
refute
the
argument
that
there
was
once
a
specific
provision
in
the
contract
that
would
have
probably
required
the
result
that
you
sought,
and
that
was
dropped
by
consent
of
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
comb,
you
are
not
arguing
for
any
norris-laguardia
act
type
of
limitation
independent
of
the
contrary,
you
are
simply
for
proper
construction
of
a
voluntary
reached
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
norris-laguardia
just
deals
with
injunctions.
the
norris-laguardia
policy
though
was
to
settle
--
it
does
have
some
impact
on
this
case,
to
some
extent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
feel
you
must
rely
in
part
on
norris-laguardia
and
not
just
on
an
interpretation
of
the
voluntarily
reached
agreement
between
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
nothing
in
the
last
that
would
permit
the
operators
from
demanding
a
clause
in
the
contract
to
require
the
international
or
the
district
to
do
everything
in
their
power
in
every
single
situation
subject
only
to
the
impossibility
to
prevent
wildcat
strikes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
general
principle
of
contracts
law
that
neither
party
will
do
anything
to
frustrate
the
legitimate
expectations
of
the
other
arising
out
of
the
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
go
further
and
say
that
the
union
guarantees
in
effect
that
there
will
be
no
strikes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
would
you
pull
this
national
labor
policy
from;
from
out
of
the
air?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
didn't
say
that
you
rewrite
the
contracts
that
people
enter
into
in
collective
bargaining.
