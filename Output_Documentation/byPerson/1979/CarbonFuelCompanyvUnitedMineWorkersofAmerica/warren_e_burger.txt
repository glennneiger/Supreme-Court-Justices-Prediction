mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

who
are
parties
to
the
contractor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
all
the
union
parties,
international,
district
and
local
all
bound
for
example
by
the
arbitration
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
could
enforce
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
relying
on
the
gateway
language
about
the
quid
pro
quo
induces
the
employer
to
make
the
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
combs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
it
from
your
argument
--
and
correct
me
if
i
have
a
misconception
of
it
--
that
your
position
would
be
the
same
prior
to
1952
under
that
old
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
puts
you
in
disagreement,
does
it,
with
the
basis
of
the
fourth
circuit's
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
quarreling
with
the
opinion
--
the
basis
of
their
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
the
clause
means
when
the
international
union
took
on
an
obligation
to
guarantee
the
integrity
of
the
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
integrity
clause
has
no
consequence
or
meaning
after
the
contract
is
signed
but
only
beforehand
in
the
negotiations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me,
just
what
do
you
think
it
does
mean.
you
have
told
us
not
what
it
does
not
mean.
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
mean
that
the
company
would
not
be
--
would
not
have
any
obligation
under
the
integrity
clause
if
the
company
refused
to
engage
in
arbitration?
