neither
the
district
nor
the
locals
are
parties
to
the
contract?
justice

stewart
as
parties
to
the
agreement?

mr.
combs,
my
brother
white
i
suppose
means
that
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
contract
at
issue
here
did
have
the
equivalent
of
an
explicit,
simple
no-strike
clause,
i.e.
by
inviting
the
parties
to
settle
their
controversies
otherwise
than
by
strikes.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
in
your
answer
to
justice
white
when
you
said
that
your
argument
would
be
no
different
if
there
were
an
explicit
simple
no-strike
clause
implied
to
me
at
least
that
you
think
this
contract
had
the
equivalent
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes;
to
that
extent.
justice
potter

lucas,
flower
and
--
whatever
they
were.
you
accept
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
a
no-strike
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
was
equivalent
to
an
explicit
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
implied
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
benedict
coal
case?
