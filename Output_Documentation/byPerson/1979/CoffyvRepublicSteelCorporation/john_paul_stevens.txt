mr.
horowitz,
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
i'm
just
was
little
puzzled.
the
--
the
2
years
is
the
necessary
nor
to
be
eligible
for
any
payments.
how
--
if
--
if
you
--
your
opponent
were
correct
in
this
case,
how
would
he
have
met
the
2-year
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
eligibility
but
not
for
the
amount
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
in
fact
agree
that
the
2
year
--
the
eligibility
is
this
an
aspect
to
seniority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
nims,
aren't
there
really
three
classes
of
--
of
seniority
that
people
who
are
senior
enough
not
to
be
laid
off,
people
who
were
in
kind
of
a
middle
category
who
gets
these
benefits,
and
then
the
very,
very
junior
people
who
don't
even
get
this
benefit
and
then
the
very,
very
junior
people
who
don't
even
get
these
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
all
i
was
suggesting
was
the
fact
that
people
who
have
even
greater
seniority
gets
some
greater
benefit
doesn't
necessarily
take
this
benefit
out
of
the
category
of
benefits
that
are
affected
by
the
length
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
saying
that
every
person
who
meets
the
2
year
requirement
always
gets
52
units?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
even
with
among
those
who
were
eligible,
seniority
has
an
effect
on
the
amount
of
the
number
of
units
and
therefore
the
number
of
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
other
than
the
interrupted
service
because
of
military
duty,
could
a
man
get
--
satisfy
the
2-year
requirement
without
also
accumulating
the
52
units?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
other
leave
of
absence
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
he
could
still
be
accumulating
his
2
years
with
earning
any
credits?
