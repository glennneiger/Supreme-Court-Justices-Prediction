mr.
michael
a.
nims
mr.
chief
and
may
it
pleases
the
court.
i
think
that
when
one
understands
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefit
plan
that
the
court
is
considering,
one
will
realize
that
if
anything
it
has
exactly
a
reverse
relationship
to
seniority
rather
than
being
a
perquisite
of
seniority.
in
the
first
place,
the
principle
benefit
of
seniority
obviously
in
a
layoff
situation
is
layoff
preference
and
the
more
seniority
the
employee
accumulates
the
less
likely
it
is,
that
he
will
in
fact
be
laid
off,
that
the
layoff
will
reach
his
seniority
date.
the
employees
--
mr.
michael
a.
nims
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
that's
always
true
of
the
seniority
plan.
that's
the
point
i'm
making
your
honor
that
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefit
which
is
the
benefit
we're
talking
about
here
is
actually
a
benefit
which
is
most
often
used
by
people
with
lesser
seniority
than
people
with
greater
seniority.
it's
more
important
to
people
with
lesser
seniority
than
people
with
greater
seniority
and
the
point
i'm
making
is
rather
than
being
a
perquisite
of
seniority,
it
indeed
operates
in
a
reverse
relationship
with
seniority.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
that's
true
your
honor,
but
that's
true
with
almost
any
benefit.
indeed
i
believe
it
was
true
with
the
vacation
benefit
before
the
court
in
foster
that
there,
there
was
a
one-year
requirement
before
you
became
eligible
for
vacation,
you
got
entitlement
to
the
vacation
in
the
second
year
by
virtue
of
having
worked
25
weeks
in
the
first
year.
and
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
analysis
would
make
this
benefit
or
the
vacation
benefit
in
foster
a
perquisite
of
seniority
or
it
would
make
every
benefit
of
perquisite
of
seniority
--
mr.
michael
a.
nims
no,
i
agree
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
do
that.
but
the
point
being
that
greater
seniority
once
you
pass
the
eligibility
threshold
so
that
you're
entitled
to
the
benefit,
greater
seniority
does
not
have
any
effect
on
the
benefit
at
all
in
a
positive
way.
the
2-year
man
who
is
eligible
to
receive
a
payment
will
get
a
benefit
as
well
the
15-year
man
if
the
layoff
happens
to
reach
his
level
of
seniority
and
the
5th
year
â€“
15-year
man
will
not
have
any
greater
benefit,
any
advantage
over
being
a
15-year
man.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
no.
it
depends
upon
from
the
work
requirement.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
no,
not
seniority
your
honor,
working
day
up
to
accumulating
the
maximum
of
52
credit
units
if
you
haven't
worked
in
2
years
and
accumulated
the
52
maximum
credit
units,
yes
the
fact
that
you
haven't
done
that
work
may
result
when
you're
having
a
lesser
number
of
benefits.
but
once
you
have
work
in
2
years
and
accumulated
52
credit
units
not
only
increased
seniority
will
not
give
a
greater
benefit,
increase
work
won't
give
you
a
greater
benefit.
further,
the
amount
of
the
benefit
represented
by
each
credit
unit
also
bears
a
reverse
relationship
to
seniority
if
it
bears
any
relationship
to
seniority.
the
plan
provides
that
the
amount
of
benefit
that
you'll
receive
in
the
event
that
you
ever
receive
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
is
affected
by
four
factors.
number
one,
the
wage
rate
of
your
job
classification,
that
wage
rate
is
established
by
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
for
each
job
classification
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
seniority
other
than
in
the
sense
that
in
some
jobs
preference
is
a
factor
of
seniority,
and
your
ability
to
hold
a
particular
job
maybe
depended
upon
seniority.
but
the
actual
wage
rate
for
that
job
classification
will
be
the
same
whether
the
individual
holding
that
is
a
2
year
man
or
a
5-year
man
or
a
10-year
man
or
a
20-year
man.
the
second
factor
in
the
amount
to
the
benefit
is
the
number
of
dependents
that
the
employee
has,
obviously
that
has
no
relationship
to
seniority
with
the
company.
the
third
factor
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
benefit
for
each
credit
unit
was
the
amount
of
state
unemployment
compensation
which
the
employee
receives
from
what
ever
state
programs
exists
in
that
particular
state.
that
has
no
involvement
with
sen
--
with
seniority
and
finally,
the
fourth
factor
that
influences
the
amount
of
benefit
is
the
amount
of
money
remaining
in
the
plan
as
whole.
the
obligation
if
the
industry
is
to
fund
the
plan
with
a
finite
number
of
dollars
agreed
to
in
the
collective-bargaining
process
then
as
the
plan
is
exhausted
through
the
layoffs
once
it
reaches
a
sufficient
diminution
to
key
in
that
part
of
the
formula,
the
amount
of
benefit
represented
by
each
credit
unit
drops.
so
that
you
actually
have
the
anomalous
situation
if
you're
focusing
on
seniority
that
the
3-year
man
is
much
more
likely
to
have
his
benefit
be
100%
of
the
possible
benefit
than
the
20-year
man
because
if
a
layoff
in
fact
gets
severe
enough
to
reach
the
20-year
man,
you'll
likely
to
have
the
fund
substantially
depleted
by
the
previous
payments
made
to
persons
of
lesser
seniorities
so
that
the
20
year
man
in
fact
finds
he's
getting
a
lesser
benefit
if
his
seniority
number
is
in
fact
reached
during
the
layoff.
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
kind
of
a
benefit
should
be
classified
to
be
a
perquisite
of
seniority
and
indeed
the
--
the
testimony
in
the
record
below
is
clear
that
it's
--
it's
not
thought
certainly
by
the
industry
and
the
by
the
people
who
negotiated
it
to
be
in
any
sense
of
perquisite
of
seniority.
rather
it
is
based
upon
the
formula
which
is
governed
by
the
actual
practical
realities
of
the
steel
industry
which
found
that
prior
to
1960
they
actual
had
a
sub
plan
which
had
a
very
precise
relationship,
between
how
many
hours
you
worked
and
the
accumulation
of
credit
units,
and
they
determined
that
that
wasn't
necessary.
it
created
an
administrative
headache
that
they
didn't
need
because
in
point
of
fact
people
who
are
working
at
least
32
hours,
if
they
worked
at
all
because
of
the
existence
of
the
short-week
benefit.
and
the
short-week
benefit
provides
that
if
you
call
an
employee
in
during
a
week
and
have
him
worked
less
than
32
hours,
essentially
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
him
for
32
hours
anyway
and
so
naturally
your
try
not
to
call
an
employee
at
all
unless
you
actually
have
32
hours
of
week
for
him.
so
the
sub
plan
and
the
formula
for
the
earning
of
credit
units
in
the
sub
plan
is
tied
to
a
formula
which
in
the
industry
and
the
practical
reality
is
based
upon
at
least
32
hours
of
work
achieving
the
earning
of
the
entire
--
of
entitlement
to
1/2
credit
unit.
now,
whether
or
not
that
ever
translates
into
a
benefit,
of
course,
depends
upon
whether
the
employee
has
to
get
laid
off
and
that
admittedly
is
a
factor
of
his
seniority,
but
the
benefit
as
suppose
to
the
layoff
is
not
a
factor
of
seniority.
indeed
it
--
if
it
has
any
relationship
with
seniority
it's
a
reverse
relationship.
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case
is
that
in
trying
to
analogize
to
other
benefits
which
have
been
before
the
court,
the
closest
benefit
according
to
the
government
is
the
severance
pay
that
was
before
the
court
in
accardi.
respondent
believes
that
that
analogy
is
faulty.
severance
pay
is
normally
and
was
in
accardi
very
much
a
factor
of
seniority.
somebody
who
had
worked
for
that
particular
railroad
19
years
and
the
20-year
people
were
not
subject
to
the
discharge
but
it
was
people
with
less
than
20-year
seniority,
somebody
who
had
worked
for
the
railroad
for
19
years
was
entitled
to
a
larger
amount
of
severance
pay
than
somebody
who
had
worked
for
18
years
and
17
years,
and
16
years
and
back
down
the
line.
and
that
we
submit
was
key
to
this
court's
analysis
of
severance
pay
being
a
long-term
benefit
which
really
the
notion
of
compensated
service
before
the
court
in
the
accardi
case
really
measuring
only
time
on
the
role
as
an
employee,
but
the
sub
benefit
is
very
different.
the
15-year
man
has
no
advantage
whatsoever
over
the
2-year
man
so
long
as
each
have
accumulated
the
maximum
number
credit
units
available
are
52
and
indeed
as
we've
shown
it
might
happen
to
work
out
that
the
15-year
man
is
at
a
disadvantage
because
of
the
diminution
in
the
money
in
the
fund
should
layoff
reach
his
level
of
seniority.
so
we
don't
feel
that
the
sub
benefit
can
possibly
be
analogy
--
analogized
properly
or
fairly
to
a
severance
benefit.
the
government
has
--
has
argued
this
morning
that
in
a
sense
the
steel
industry
is
acting
in
an
inconsistent
fashion
in
treating
the
2-year
continuous
service
requirement
as
seniority
and
crediting
the
veteran
for
that,
but
not
crediting
him
with
the
time
in
the
military
for
purposes
of
accruing
credit
units.
we
don't
feel
that's
inconsistent
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
the
applicable
bargaining
agreements
and
plans
expressly
provide
for
both
of
those
situations.
they
expressly
provide
that
service
in
the
military
will
not
break
continuous
service
in
the
company
and
they
expressly
provide
that
there
will
be
no
accrual
of
credit
units
for
the
individual
during
the
period
of
time
he's
in
the
military,
so
they're
certainly
consistent
with
the
underlying
contractual
documents,
but
more
important,
they're
consistent
with
what
the
industry
regards
as
the
law
being
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
other
courts
throughout
the
last
several
years.
continuous
service
as
that
is
defined
in
the
pension
program
has
indeed
notions
of
seniority,
notion
of
simply
being
on
the
rules
as
an
employee
and
the
industry
recognizes
that
and
does
not
break
continuous
service
for
pension
purposes,
for
sub
purposes,
for
any
benefit
purposes
when
the
veteran
leaves
the
civilian
employee
and
then
comes
back
within
the
permitted
statutory
period.
but
that's
no
different
than
the
situation
that
was
in
front
of
this
court
in
the
foster
v.
dravo
case
in
which
this
court
considered
vacation
entitlement
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
that
while
you
have
to
work
in
the
required
number
of
weeks
in
order
to
earn
vacation
eligibility
for
any
particular
year,
if
in
fact
a
5-year
man
has
two
weeks
vacation
and
a
10-year
man
has
3
weeks
vacation,
and
a
20-year
man
has
4
weeks
vacation,
in
that
sense
under
the
plan
in
front
of
the
court
in
dravo,
the
--
the
defendant
there,
the
company
there
did
credit
time
and
service
for
purposes
of
determining
the
maximum
amount
of
vacation
eligibility
which
an
individual
employee
would
have,
and
the
court
noted
that
in
its
footnote.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
earning
that
four
weeks
vacation
that
you
may
have
the
potential
entitlement
to
is
also
a
factor
of
seniority,
the
court
found
that
it
was
not.
it
found
that
it
was
conditioned
upon
a
bona
fide
work
requirement
that
a
traditional
notion
of
a
vacation
is
a
short-term
reward
for
work
actually
rendered.
and
that
wasn't
changed
by
the
fact
that
also
it's
traditional
that
the
amount
of
vacation
you
can
earn
a
reward
for
is
a
factor
of
your
total
service
over
a
large
number
of
--
of
years,
and
therefore
a
20-year
man
may
get
four
weeks
vacation
while
a
15-year
man
get
three.
that
didn't
change
the
actual
earning
of
vacation
in
any
particular
year
as
being
key
to
a
bona
fide
work
requirement,
as
being
reasonably
key
to
such
a
requirement,
that
didn't
change
the
traditional
notion
of
vacation
in
this
work
site.
we
think
that
the
same
is
true
with
the
sub
plan.
there
is
a
minimum
vesting
period
of
2
years,
but
it
also
should
be
understood
that
that
period
relates
only
to
the
actual
entitlement
to
payment
of
a
benefit.
it
does
not
relate
to
the
earning
of
the
credit
unit,
so
that
the
first
week
in
which
the
individual
employee
works,
he
accumulates
1/2
credit
unit.
he
merely
has
a
2-year
eligibility
requirement
before
he
can
receive
a
benefit
in
the
event
of
layoff,
but
that's
--
that's
no
different
than
with
lots
of
other
benefits
which
don't
kick
in
until
an
employee
has
had
some
minimum
period
of
time
with
the
company.
that's
true
in
many
companies
of
hospitalization
benefits
or
sick
pay
of
many
other
kinds
of
benefits
which
i
think
the
court
would
readily
agree
that
if
the
focus
is
on
the
real
nature
of
the
benefit,
those
benefits
are
thought
to
be
short-term
compensation
benefits
rather
perquisite
of
seniority,
but
they
still
may
have
an
eligibility
requirement
that
you
be
with
the
company
1
or
2
years
before
the
company
starts
to
fund
those
benefits
for
you
and
we
don't
think
that
that
changes
every
benefit
that
may
exist
into
a
perquisite
of
seniority.
we
don't
think
the
court
found
that
in
the
foster
v.
dravo
decision.
so
in
summing
up,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
we
think
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
wrote
two
very
detailed
opinions.
he
wrote
the
first
opinion
before
he
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
guidance
in
alabama
power
in
which
he
analyzed
why
the
industry
had
the
work
requirement
it
had,
why
it
had
the
formula
it
had,
how
the
benefit
was
applied
and
as
he
interpreted
the
court's
decisions
up
to
that
point
in
time,
he
wrote
a
--
we
believe
very
detailed
opinion
as
to
why
the
sub
benefit
was
not
a
perquisite
of
seniority
and
why
the
plan
should
be
administered
according
to
its
terms.
following
this
court's
decision
in
alabama
power,
he
wrote
another
detailed
opinion
focusing
precisely
on
the
real
nature
of
the
benefit
and
concluding
based
upon
the
record
made
in
front
of
him,
that
the
real
nature
of
the
benefit
with
short-term
compensation
was
substitute
for
wages
in
areas
where
wages
had
traditionally
been
paid.
we
believe
those
two
decisions
correctly
interpret
the
plan
and
the
law.
we
believe
the
affirmance
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
proper.
would
--
we
would
say
one
thing,
there
is
of
course
a
conflict
between
the
courts
in
this
case
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which
also
had
the
steel
industry
plan
in
front
it
and
it's
decision
in
hoffman
v.
bethlehem
steel,
but
that
decision
and
your
honors
i'm
sure
we'll
read
it
carefully,
was
rendered
in
1973
prior
to
either
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
foster
v.
dravo
or
the
opinion
of
this
court
--
of
this
court
in
alabama
power
v.
davis.
and
the
focus
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
hoffman
was
that
since
it
was
theoretically
possible
to
earn
a
1/2
credit
unit
with
as
little
as
one
hour
work
in
a
week,
the
third
circuit
felt
that
the
same
bizarre
result
which
this
court
had
mention
in
accardi
was
possible.
but
this
court
has
indicated
in
its
decision
in
foster
v.
dravo
and
its
decision
in
alabama
power
v.
davis
that
that
bizarre
result
theoretical
though
it
maybe
is
not
the
appropriate
analysis.
mr.
michael
a.
nims
it's
very
theoretical
particular
in
this
--
particularly
in
this
case
in
which
there's
been
testimony
as
to
these
industry's
that
need
under
its
