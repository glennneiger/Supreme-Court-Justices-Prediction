mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
concerns
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statutory
provisions
that
guarantee
certain
reemployment
rights
to
veterans
upon
their
return
to
employment.
these
provisions
are
now
codified
in
38
u.s.c.,
2021.
the
question
here
is
how
those
provisions
apply
to
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
or
sub's
that
are
provided
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
between
respondent
and
the
united
steel-workers.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
guarantee
against
loss
of
seniority
under
the
act
requires
that
the
time
spent
by
a
veteran
in
the
service
be
included
in
the
time
used
to
compute
sub's.
sub's
are
payments
that
are
made
by
the
employer
to
employees
who
have
been
laid
off.
these
payments
are
over
and
above
the
unemployment
compensation
that
the
employee
otherwise
receives
from
the
state.
under
the
sub
plan
involved
in
this
case,
which
is
set
out
beginning
at
page
17
of
the
appendix,
sub
payments
are
made
on
a
weekly
basis
for
a
period
of
up
to
52
weeks.
that
period
depends
upon
the
number
of
sub
credits
that
the
employee
has
accrued.
the
amount
of
each
weekly
payment
is
determined
according
to
a
formula
set
out
in
section
1
of
the
plan.
that
formula
depends
on
several
factors,
including
the
employee's
present
salary
and
his
number
of
dependents
and
the
amount
of
compensation
that
he
receives
from
the
state.
the
formula
does
not
depend
on
the
amount
of
time
that
the
employee
has
been
employed.
therefore,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
about
the
amount
of
each
weekly
benefit
that
was
received
by
petitioner.
what
the
dispute
in
this
case
does
concern,
is
the
length
of
the
time
period
over
which
this
weekly
sub
payments
continue.
this
period
is
determined
by
the
number
of
sub
credits.
and
these
credits
are
earned
through
the
passage
of
time
as
described
in
section
2
of
the
sub
plan
on
page
19.
one-half
credit
is
earned
per
week.
an
eligible
week
for
which
1/2
credit
maybe
on,
is
one
and
which
the
employee
has
any
of
the
following
hours;
hours
worked
for
the
company,
hours
that
are
not
worked
but
for
which
the
employee
is
paid.
for
example,
vacation
time
or
time
spend
on
jury
duty
and
also,
certain
categories
of
hours
not
worked
and
for
which
the
employee
is
not
paid,
where
the
employee
is
performing
certain
duties
for
the
local
union
or
as
on
a
certain
specified
disability
leave.
when
an
employee
is
laid
off
and
receives
weekly
payments,
he
uses
up
the
sub
credits.
finally,
under
the
plan
an
employee
is
not
eligible
to
receive
sub
payments
at
all,
no
matter
how
many
credits
he
has
accrued
until
he
has
two
years
of
continuous
service
with
the
employer.
as
an
example
of
how
the
system
works,
if
an
employee
begin
work
for
the
company
and
worked
or
engaged
in
time
of
these
other
eligible
activities
for
continuous
period
the
year
and
a
half
and
was
then
laid
off
he
would
have
accrued
39
sub
credits
by
that
time.
that
would
be
at
the
rate
of
1/2
credit
per
week.
however,
because
he
had
not
reached
the
2-year
eligibility
threshold,
he
would
not
receive
any
sub
payments
when
he
was
laid
off.
in
this
case
the
petitioner
began
working
for
respondent
in
1968.
and
work
for
respondent
for
a
period
of
four-and-half
months
during
that
time.
he
was
then
laid
off
and
he
then
left
respondent's
employment.
he
had
accrued
9
sub
credits
during
the
time
that
he
was
employed
in
1968.
however,
because
he
elected
to
leave
respondent's
employment
those
credits
were
canceled.
he
then
begun
to
work
for
respondent
again
in
late
january
1969
and
continued
to
work
for
respondent
until
he
entered
military
service
in
september
of
1969.
he
thus
earned
approximately
16
sub
periods,
excuse
me
sub
credits
during
the
slight
of
period.
he
served
in
the
military
unit
august
1971
when
he
was
honorably
discharged.
he
was
the
reinstated
to
this
previous
position
with
respondent.
however,
because
of
respondent's
economic
situation,
he
was
immediately
placed
in
layoff
status.
he
remained
layoff
for
period
of
9
1/2
months
until
july
1972.
during
the
layoff
period,
petitioner
received
sub
payments
for
approximately
16
weeks,
corresponding
to
the
16
sub
credits
that
he
had
earned
before
he
entered
the
service.
however,
he
did
not
receive
any
payments
for
the
remaining
5
1/2
months
that
the
layoff
continued.
had
petitioner
not
entered
military
service
and
continued
in
respondent's
employment,
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
he
would
have
52
sub
credits
at
the
time
of
his
layoff.
thus,
he
would
have
received
sub
credits
for
the,
excuse
me,
sub
payments
for
the
entire
duration
of
his
layoff.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
then,
is
simply
whether
petitioner
should
have
had
his
military
service
counted
in
determining
his
total
sub
credits
when
he
was
reinstated
following
his
military
service.
petitioner
originally
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
alleging
that
the
failure
to
consider
his
service
time
in
computing
his
sub
credits
violated
his
statutory
rights.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioner's
contention,
holding
that
the
sub
plan
established
a
bona
fide
work
requirement
for
the
earning
of
sub
credits.
petitioner
appealed
and
while
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
alabama
power
company
v.
davis,
holding
that
pension
benefits
or
perquisite
of
seniority
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
then
vacated
the
district
court's
decision
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
alabama
power.
the
district
court
again
held
for
respondent,
stating
that,
“entitlement
to
sub
benefits
requires
more
than
continued
status,
such
as
a
work
requirement
to
any
actual
performance
on
the
job”.
the
court
of
appeals
then
affirmed
for
the
reason
stated
by
the
district
court.
the
relevant
provision
of
the
statute
involved
here
is
that
portion
of
38
u.s.c
2021
(b)
(1)
that
requires
veterans
to
be
reinstated
without
loss
of
seniority.
if
this
court
finds
that
sub
payments
are
perquisite
of
seniority
within
the
meaning
of
that
section
then
petitioner
must
be
given
credit
for
his
army
service
time
in
computing
his
sub
credits.
that
is
a
consequence
of
two
main
principles
that
were
established
in
this
court's
decision
in
fishgold.
first,
the
escalator
principle
was
established,
that
is
that
a
veteran
who
returns
to
his
employment
is
to
be
reinstated
at
the
same
place,
he
would
have
been
had
he
remained
in
the
employment,
that
is,
at
the
place
he
would
have
been
on
the
escalator,
that
he
remained
in
employment
not
at
the
place
he
got
off
the
escalator
when
he
entered
the
service.
secondly,
fishgold
also
established
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
ought
to
be
liberally
construed
for
the
benefit
of
the
veteran.
in
this
court's
decision
in
alabama
power,
it
established
the
appropriate
analysis
for
determining
whether
a
particular
benefit
is
indeed
a
perquisite
of
seniority.
the
real
nature
of
the
benefit
is
to
be
examined.
and
it
is
to
be
determined
whether
other
one
hand
the
benefit
is
primarily
in
the
nature
of
a
reward
for
length
of
service
in
which
case
it
is
a
perquisite
of
seniority
or
on
the
other
hand
whether
the
benefit
is
primarily
short-term
compensation
for
work
performed.
applying
this
test,
severance
pay
and
pension
benefits
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
perquisites
of
seniority.
vacation
pay
has
been
held
to
be
primarily
in
the
nature
of
compensation
for
work
performed.
before
i
turn
to
discussion
of
those
factors
that
we
believe
indicate
that
sub
should
be
treated
as
a
perquisite
of
seniority,
i
would
like
briefly
to
discuss
the
notion
of
a
work
requirement
upon
which
the
district
court
and
respondent
have
focused
some
of
their
attention.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
sub
credits
are
primarily
earn
by
employees
who
are
workers.
this
is
naturally
true
of
most
benefits
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
whether
they
are
determined
by
language
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
refers
to
work
or
whether
that
it
is
determined
by
language
that
refers
use
of
service.
now,
in
alabama
power,
a
contention
was
made
to
this
court
that
any
benefit
that
is
determined
by
work
requirement,
that
is
where
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
specifies
that
most
of
the
employees
who
earn
the
benefit
will
be
working,
should
automatically
dispose
of
any
contention
that
the
benefit
maybe
treated
as
a
perquisite
of
seniority.
the
court
expressly
rejected
that
contention
in
alabama
power
and
it
noted
that
almost
any
benefit
could
be
tied
to
a
work
requirement
such
as
existed
in
that
case.
that
would
permit
the
employer
himself
to
decide
whether
a
benefit
was
a
perquisite
of
seniority
and
the
employer
himself
to
decide
whether
the
veteran
was
entitled
to
have
his
service
time
credited.
however,
congress
has
not
left
that
decision
up
to
the
employer.
this
is
a
decision
that
congress
has
made.
now,
as
far
as
the
work
requirement
in
this
case,
it
is
significantly
less
in
the
work
requirement
that
this
court
rejected
in
alabama
power.
there,
the
question
was
whether
the
employee
was
entitled
to
accredited
service
time
for
the
time
that
he
spent
in
the
military.
accredited
service
was
defined
in
terms
of
full
time
service
at
40
hours
per
week.
moreover,
the
limited
exceptions
in
alabama
power,
applied
only
to
employees
who
are
on
paid
leave
not
employees
who
are
in
certain
categories
of
unpaid
leave
as
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
sub
benefits
should
be
treated
as
a
perquisite
of
seniority.
they
serve
a
purpose
that
is
akin
to
the
most
traditional
seniority
benefit.
and
this
analysis
incidentally
was
made
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
foster
decision
which
was
later
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
--
the
primary
purpose
of
sub
benefits
is
to
protect
employees
against
economic
loss
during
periods
of
the
diminished
employment.
it
acts
as
an
adjunct
to
the
normal
layoff
protection
that
employees
get
when
they
accrue
seniority
benefits.
thus
when,
there's
an
economic
downturn
and
the
employer
is
forced
to
layoff
a
number
of
employees,
what
happens,
is
those
employees
that
have
accrued
the
most
amount
of
seniority
are
protected
from
layoff
because
of
the
seniority
that
they
have
accrued.
employees
who
have
not
accrued
enough
seniority
to
be
protected
from
layoff
get
this
more
limited
protection
of
the
sub
benefits.
that
is
they
receive
some
money
to
tie
them
over
the
period
for
which
they
are
unemployed
and
employees
who
have
the
least
seniority
at
all
will
either
not
be
eligible
at
all
for
sub
payments
or
they
will
receive
less
because
they
have
accrued
fewer
credits.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
the
subs
are
only
intended
to
be
a
supplement
to
the
unemployment
benefits
provided
by
the
state
and
the
formula
for
figuring
out
how
much
sub
is
to
be
paid
inclusive
deduction
for
the
amount
of
state
on
employment
benefits.
and
in
fact
if
an
employee,
for
some
reason,
does
not
get
state
unemployment
benefits
for
reason
that
was
within
his
control
if
he
doesn't
apply
for
them
for
example,
then
he
will
not
be
eligible
to
receive
subs.
we
think
the
best
analogy
to
the
subs
is
a
quite
similar
benefit
of
severance
pay
that
this
court
held
to
be
a
perquisite
of
seniority
in
the
accardi
case.
severance
pay
also
provides
income
that
ties
an
employee
over
a
period
of
unemployment
as
to
sub's.
the
difference
essentially
is
that
with
sub's
layoff
is
only
temporary
and
severance
pay
deals
with
the
issue
of
permanent
layoff.
as
in
the
accardi
the
intent
of
sub's,
is
to
provide
compensation
for
the
lost
of
the
rights
and
expectations
that
the
employee
has
accrued
over
his
period
of
service.
it
is
not
to
provide
compensation
for
the
work
that
the
employee
did
in
the
past.
the
amount
the
sub
benefits
as
the
amount
of
severance
pay
benefits
are
not
at
all
tied
to
the
amount
of
work
that
was
done
in
the
past.
moreover,
the
provisions
of
the
plan
are
completely
inconsistent
with
any
notion
that
sub's
are
to
be
treated
as
compensation
for
work
performed.
first
of
all,
sub
credits
are
forfeitable
at
anytime
if
the
employee
incurs
a
break
in
continuous
service.
therefore,
an
employee
could
work
for
20
years
and
then
if
he
incurred
to
break
in
service,
he
would
loss
all
the
sub
credit
that
he
had
accrued
and
if
he
hadn't
been
laid
off
in
the
time,
he
never
would
have
received
any
benefit
at
all.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there's
a
maximum
52.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
at
--
at
the
time
that
in
this
collective-bargaining
agreement
i
said
existed
at
time
the
petitioner
was
laid
off,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
was
laid
off
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
was
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
he
was
laid
off
as
soon
as
he
came
back
to
work
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right,
because,
according
to
his
seniority
status,
they've
already
passed
the
--
the
time
when
he
was
then
laid
off
had
he
been
back
before.
he
still
have
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
he
--
he
first
works
for
period
in
1968,
then
was
laid
off
and
then
quit.
and
at
that
time
he
forfeit
of
all
the
credits
they
had.
he
then
came
back
to
work
and
worked
for
a
period
of
time
which
enabled
him
to
accrue
16
more
credits
and
he
then
entered
the
service.
and
he
--
when
he
came
back
he
was
given
those
16
credits
that
he
accrued
before
he
entered
the
service.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
when
you
quit
you
forfeit
the
benefits.
now,
what
--
what
happen
here
is
that,
the
employer
actually
made
a
mistake
and
did
give
him
credit
for
the
benefits
that
he
had
accrued
even
before
he
quit
and
made
payments
upon
to
that
but
later
on
the
mistake
was
realized
and
petitioner
had
to
repay
that
money.
so
in
effect,
he
did
not
get
the
credit
and
we
don't
contend
that
he
should
have
gotten
credit
for
that
time.
most
significantly
there
is
a
vesting
requirement
here
before
the
employee
is
eligible
to
receive
sub
payments.
as
in
alabama
power,
there
was
a
vesting
requirement.
here
--
no.
if
the
employee
works
for
any
period
less
than
2
years,
he
does
not
receive
any
sub
payments.
even
after,
the
two-year
period
comes
the
payments
are
still
contention
upon
his
being
laid
off.
now,
this
is
completely
inconsistent
with
any
notion
of
compensation,
that
the
idea
of
sub
payments
was
compensation
and
the
employee
--
if
an
employee
did
a
certain
amount
of
work
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
payment
for
that
work
whether
or
not
he
was
laid
off
and
whether
or
not
he
manages
to
hang
around
for
2
years.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
respondent
was
willing
to
count
his
military
service
time
for
the
purposes
of
the
2-year
requirement
but
it
was
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
it
was
treated
inconsistently
for
the
two
different
purposes
under
the
sub
plan.
the
reason
i
believe
that
the
respondent
felt
compelled
to
give
credit
for
the
military
time
is
that,
that
2-year
requirement
is
--
is
the
same
requirement
that
is
generally
occurs
throughout
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
it's
defined
through
the
same
definitional
section.
and
it's
clear
that
for
--
the
more
traditional
seniority
benefits
he
would
have
to
have
been
given
credit
for
his
time
in
the
army.
so,
if
respondent
had
not
given
him
credit
for
time
in
army
it
would
–
he
would
have
been
using
same
definition
in
giving
him
credit
under
that
definition
for
some
purposes
and
not
for
other
purposes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan

moreover,
there
is
absolutely
no
correlation
between
the
amount
of
work
that
is
performed
by
the
employee
and
the
amount
of
benefits
that
he
accrues.
he
accrues
1/2
credit
per
week,
no
matter
how
much
work
he
does
during
that
week.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
now
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
one
hour
is
certainly
the
exception.
there
are
probably
no
instances
of
one
hour.
respondent
put
on
testimony
in
the
district
court
and
we
accept
the
district
court's
finding
that
as
a
general
rule
most
employees
work
32
hours
in
any
given
week
or
work
none
at
all.
that
is
only
for
general
rule.
it's
clear
that
in
some
cases
and
place
did
not
manage
to
work
32
hours.
there
is
an
entire
section
of
the
sub
plans,
section
4
that
is
devoted
to
the
question
of
what
benefits
are
paid
when
employee
does
not
work
32
hours.
even
a
--
even
if
all
employees
have
worked
32
hours,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
that
is
not
the
normal
amount
of
work.
the
normal
amount
work
is
40
hours
per
week.
employees
who
work
32
and
employees
who
work
40
accrue
the
same
amount
of
sub
benefits.
moreover
employees
who
work
overtime
also
accrue
the
same
amount
of
sub
benefits.
apart
from
--
apart
from
the
amount
of
sub
credit
they've
accrued,
the
weekly
--
the
amount
of
the
weekly
benefit,
the
actual
money
which
is
paid
to
the
employee
has
absolutely
no
correlation
to
the
work
that
is
performed.
it
depends
upon
the
number
of
dependents
that
he
has,
it
depends
upon
his
salary
at
the
time
of
layoff,
not
at
the
time
that
the
credits
are
earned
and
it
depends
on
the
amount
of
money
in
the
fund.
now,
in
fact
the
--
the
fact
that
it
depends
to
some
extent
upon
his
salary
at
the
time
of
layoff
is
an
aspect
of
seniority,
if
anything
in
determining
the
amount
for
this
payment
–
or
these
payments.
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
alabama
power
where
as
well
it
was
noted
at
the
pension
benefits
that
were
paid
depended
upon
the
employees
compensation
at
the
time
that
he
was
--
began
to
receive
pension
benefits
not
at
the
time
that
he
earned
the
credits
for
them.
finally,
the
specific
points
that
this
court
mentioned
in
foster
as
indicating
some
sort
of
correlation
between
the
amount
of
work
and
the
amount
of
earning
a
credit
are
absent
in
this
case.
there
are
two
factors
that
this
court
mentioned
in
foster.
first,
that
vacation
benefit
--
more
vacation
benefits
were
earned
by
employees
who
worked
overtime,
than
employees
who
did
not
and
there
was
a
special
provision
that
was
made
for
overtime.
here
there
is
no
such
provision.
secondly,
in
foster,
employees
who
did
not
meet
the
minimum
threshold,
there
you
had
to
work
25
weeks
per
year
in
order
to
get
a
vacation.
employee
--
certain
employees
who
did
not
work
25
weeks
per
year
were
entitled
to
pro
rata
vacation.
and
here
there
is
no
such
pro
rata
requirement.
an
employee
who
works
all
the
way
up
to
the
2
years
is
not
entitled
to
any
sub
payments
at
all.
now,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
an
employee
who
works
less
than
32
hours
is
entitled
to
the
full
one
half
credit
–
one-half
sub
credit.
now,
what
section
4
of
the
agreement
does
is
that
it
defines
what's
called
the
“short
week
benefit”.
that
is
if
an
employee
works
24
hours
in
a
week,
he
is
entitled
to
a
benefit
that
he'll
be
paid
as
if
he
had
worked
32.
but,
and
--
and
the
idea
i
think
of
that
provision
is
probably
--
it
was
probably
put
in
mostly
the
instigation
of
the
union
is
to
encourage
the
employer
to
make
sure
that
--
i
should
say
to
penalize
the
employer
for
not
allowing
employees
to
work
32
hours
per
week.
it
acts
as
disincentive
to
the
employer,
to
schedule
employees
for
less
than
32
hours
per
week.
now,
as
far
as
how
it
fits
into
the
sub
plan,
an
employee
who
works
less
than
32
hours
per
week
does
get
half
in
sub
credit
no
matter
how
many
hours
he
works
he
maybe
eligible
for
a
benefit
under
section
4
of
the
plan.
again
he
is
not
eligible
for
that
benefit
unless
he's
already
got
2
years
of
service
under
his
belt.
if
he
receives
a
benefit
under
section
4,
he
would
still
accrue
1/2
sub
credit
for
that
time
but
--
but
because
he's
receiving
a
benefit
he
would
also
have
to
give
up
one
sub
--
excuse
me
1/2
sub
credit
for
that
time.
so,
he
would
end
up
in
not
accruing
additional
credits
if
he
was
actually
receiving
a
benefit.
petitioner
in
this
case
left
his
employment
and
went
to
serve
in
the
military.
when
he
return
from
his
employment
he
was
disadvantage
as
compared
to
those
other
employees
who
began
employment
on
the
same
day
that
he
did.
had
he
remained
in
a
civilian
employment,
he
would
have
had
52
sub
credits
and
would
have
received
payments
for
an
additional
22
weeks.
having
served
in
the
military
he
was
denied
these
payments.
we
believe
that
this
is
precisely
the
result
that
congress
was
intending
to
avoid
when
it
passed
the
veterans'
re-employment
rights
act
statute
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
--
should
hold
that
sub
benefits
are
perquisite
of
seniority
and
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
his
credits.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
do
have
a
couple
points
i
would
like
to
make
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
regard
of
the
comment
about
the
bizarre
results,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
that
is
merely
a
theoretical
analysis
and
i'm
sure
it
was
theoretical
in
accardi
as
well.
the
court
there
was
just
using
the
bizarre
results
to
indicate
that
the
plan
in
no
way
attempted
to
compensate
for
the
amount
of
work
performed.
the
same
is
true
here.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
this
plan
that
indicates
that
sub
benefits
are
intended
to
be
compensation.
respondent
has
noted
the
four
factors
that
go
into
determining
the
amount
of
the
weekly
payment
that
is
made,
not
one
of
those
factors
has
anything
to
do
with
compensation
for
work.
the
only
work
requirement
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
most
of
the
employees
who
earn
this
benefits
work.
there
is
not
a
requirement
that
all
employees
work.
as
i
discussed
in
setting
out
the
plan,
there
are
several
categories
of
employees
who
are
not
working
who
can
also
receive
benefits.
and
essentially
the
only
difference
between
the
work
requirement
here
and
the
work
requirement
in
any
case
were
there
is
just
a
period
of
service
that
is
required
to
accrue
a
benefit,
for
example,
in
the
most
standard
seniority
situation,
is
that
respondent
has
seen
fit
to
exclude
certain
categories
of
employees
on
leaves
of
--
who
are
on
leaves
of
absence
from
receiving
these
sub
benefits.
now,
our
contention
is
that,
these
rights
are
guaranteed
by
congress
and
the
fact
that
respondent
chooses
to
exclude
certain
employees
who
are
leaves
of
absence
does
not
mean
that
veterans
can
be
excluded
from
these
benefits.
i'd
also
like
to
discuss
the
point
about
whether
this
is
a
seniority
benefit
simply
because
employees
who
have
20
years
of
service
and
employees
who
have
15
years
of
service
will
receive
the
same
benefit.
that's
clear
that
at
the
lower
levels
of
the
seniority
ladder
there
is
a
seniority
distinction
made
based
on
length
of
service.
employees
who
have
more
service
are
eligible
for
the
benefits,
employees
who
have
less
than
2
years
or
not,
employees
who
have
more
service
may
get
up
to
the
52
credit
maximum
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
takes
2
years,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
unless
--
unless
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
up
till
that
time
there
is
a
difference.
and
we
submit
that
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
there's
–
it's
as
of
no
significance
of
petitioner
that
everyone
--
whether
everyone
above
him
had
52
units
or
whether
some
of
them
had
52
and
some
of
them
had
200
and
some
then
had
300.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
wouldn't
have
–-
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
nobody
can
have
more
that
52.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
but
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
if
someone
could
have
200
or
300.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
you
can
have
less
and
petitioner
had
less.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
--
he
acquires
credits.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
they're
not
good
for
his
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
would
have
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
--
no,
he
gets
--
he
gets
1/2
per
week
so
after
a
year
he
has
26.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
has
--
he
has
some
writ
and
allege
of
26
but
they're
not
good
for
anything.
if
he's
laid
off,
he
can't
collect
any
payments.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
so
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
he
would
then
have
52
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
--
that's
right.
he
would
have
--
he
would
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
52
by
that,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
if
he
was
on
some
leave
of
absence
during
the
2
years
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--
was
not
eligible
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct
and
if
he
was
on
layoff
status
as
well
he
would
be
accumulating
his
2
years.
and
i
just
like
to
briefly
allude
to
the
foster
decision
which
respondent
has
cited.
in
foster
as
this
court
explained
in
alabama
power,
the
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
vacation
benefits
are
understood
to
be
directly
related
to
work,
that
there
are
(inaudible)
for
worked
performed.
and
that
there
the
court
did
not
find
that
there
was
any
reason
to
diverge
from
that
understanding
but
here
where
there's
clearly
a
seniority
aspect
to
this
benefit
as
we've
just
discussed.
the
question
then
is
whether
the
benefit
is
to
be
characterized
a
short-term
compensation
for
worked
performed
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
for
the
number
credits.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
number
of
credits
aren't,
correct
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--
whether
by
work
or
by
some
other
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
it
stipulated
that
had
he
remained
in
employment
he
would
have
had
52
credits
at
the
time.
if
there
is
no
further
question,
thank
you.
