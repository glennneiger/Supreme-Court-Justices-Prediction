mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
only
one
issue
before
this
court
today
and
that
is
whether
to
adopt
the
special
master's
report
wherein
he
concludes
that
the
boundary
between
ohio
and
kentucky
is
the
northerly
1792
low
water
mark.
ohio
respectfully
submits
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
fully
support
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
and
therefore
it
should
be
adopted.
i
hope
to
use
my
time
this
morning
to
make
just
two
points.
first,
the
decision
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
is
indeed
a
fixed
boundary
decision;
and,
secondly,
there
are
even
policy
considerations
that
are
particularly
appropriate
today
which
compel
this
same
decision
to
be
followed.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
we
most
assuredly
agree
with
that
statement.
and
i
can
direct
your
honor's
attention
for
a
moment
to
page
12
of
kentucky's
exceptions,
i
submit
that
in
arkansas
v.
tennessee,
a
case
cited
on
page
12
by
kentucky,
the
general
rule
is
set
out,
and
as
characterized
by
this
court
in
1918,
it
is
settled
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
where
running
streams
are
the
boundaries
between
states,
the
same
rule
applies
as
between
private
proprietors,
namely
that
when
the
bed
and
channel
are
changed
by
the
natural
and
gradual
processes
known
as
erosion
and
accretion,
the
boundary
follows
the
varying
course
of
the
stream.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
if
indeed,
as
kentucky
has
already
conceded,
it
was
a
gradual
process
which
caused
the
channel
north
of
green
river
island
to
dry
up,
then
indiana,
not
kentucky,
would
have
been
determined
to
rightfully
possess
green
river
island
and
then
later
in
the
opinion,
because
of
another
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence,
to
have
lost
it.
but
that
isn't
what
happened
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
no,
your
honor,
most
decidedly
we
are
not.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
indiana
v.
kentucky
holding
that
there
is
a
fixed
boundary
between
those
states,
a
fixed
boundary
as
of
the
date
of
kentucky's
statehood,
1792.
therefore
the
principles
of
accretion
and
avulsion
do
not
apply
to
the
ohio
river,
and
a
special
master
so
found.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
it
is
reconcilable,
your
honor,
because
this
court
in
1890
determined
that
there
was
a
fixed
boundary
along
the
river.
it
determined
it
because
there
are
only
two
constructions
that
we
can
give
to
that
case.
either
it
was
an
avulsion
case
or
it
was
a
fixed
boundary
case,
and
i
submit
it
cannot
be
an
avulsion
case
because
the
language
in
arkansas
v.
tennessee
sets
out
a
rule
long
settled
and
no
longer
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
a
gradual
change
in
the
river,
in
the
channel
and
bed
of
the
river
would
be
accredited.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
nebraska
v.
iowa
was
dealing
with
the
middle
of
the
river
boundary
and
unlike
the
boundary
here
that
is
fixed
by
the
cession,
a
deed
and
apparently
this
court
in
handly's
and
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
construed
those
matters
to
have
fixed
the
boundary
as
of
1972.
the
special
master
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
the
original
81,
in
a
report
which
is
now
lodged
with
the
court
but
has
not
as
yet
officially
received,
comes
to
that
same
conclusion
in
both
matters.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that
is
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
just
in
passing,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
this
court's
decisions
recognized
that
in
1890
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
it
was
most
relevant
that
the
court
inquire
into
exactly
what
the
status
of
events
was
in
1792,
and
the
court
points
out
in
that
opinion
that
if
we
could
just
look
today
we
might
come
to
a
different
result
because
the
water
is
now
all
south
of
the
island,
but
we
can't
do
that.
it
is
a
fixed
boundary.
we
have
to
look
to
june
1,
1792,
and
in
looking
at
that
date,
the
date
that
kentucky
became
a
state,
we
have
to
examine
where
was
that
river,
and
at
that
time,
after
examining
all
of
the
evidence,
they
were
able
to
conclude
that
indeed
the
waters
of
the
river
ohio
did
indeed
run
to
the
north
of
that
island
and
therefore,
because
it
is
a
fixed
boundary,
the
boundary
remains
there
irrespective
of
whether
the
boundary
has
changed
by
avulsion,
by
accretion
or
anything
else.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
yes,
your
honor,
it
most
certainly
was
because
of
the
cession
and
the
interpretation
which
this
court
has
placed
on
what
that
document
did
and
what
boundary
it
set,
whereas
in
missouri
v.
nebraska
or
nebraska
v.
iowa
the
treaties
that
were
involved
set
the
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
and
obviously
when
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
all
of
these
normal
common
law
rules
of
erosion
and
accretion
and
reliction
and
avulsion
apply,
but
they
don't
apply
here
in
our
case,
and
this
court
so
found
in
the
1890
decision.
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
i
think
that
really
brings
me
to
the
policy
considerations
that
i
indicated
i
wanted
to
discuss
anyway.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
it
would
have
been,
yes,
that's
right,
as
always,
the
navigable
channel
within
the
river.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
practical
result
is
that
somewhere
in
that
river
there
is
a
1792
low
water
mark.
we've
already
--
this
court
has
already
noted
that
the
damming
of
the
river,
particularly
the
large
dams
since
1955,
have
greatly
widened
the
river
and
by
widening
it
the
1792
low
water
mark
is
somewhere
out
in
the
river.
clearly,
kentucky
would
have
you
believe
that
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
fishermen
or
for
the
industry
that
must
discharge
water
or
other
substances
into
the
river
from
determining
where
they
are,
are
they
in
ohio
or
are
they
in
kentucky.
i
submit
the
contrary
is
true
-
a
fixed
boundary
is
much
more
convenient
and
therefore
much
less
subject
to
cause
great
amounts
of
litigation.
for
instance
--
and
let's
take
the
example
of
industry,
a
power
plant,
for
example.
before
the
power
plant
can
be
constructed,
it
must
obtain
a
certificate
and
a
permit
under
the
clean
water
act
from
the
state
in
which
it
will
discharge.
if
the
boundary
is
going
to
be
a
constantly
moving
boundary
and
if
we
assume
that
my
arm
is
the
discharge
pipe
and
that
this
is
the
moving
boundary
today
and
the
pipe
is
in
kentucky
waters,
tomorrow
the
boundary
can
be
here.
does
that
mean
they
have
to
stop
construction
and
go
back
to
the
other
state?
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
1792
low
water
mark
that
is
fixed,
whether
it
is
by
monuments
or
not,
at
least
he
has
some
idea
and
it
will
become
generally
well
known,
where
you
have
about
80
to
100
feet
on
the
river,
if
you
are
within
80
feet
of
ohio's
bank,
you
are
safe,
you
are
not
going
to
be
arrested
by
kentucky
for
fishing
in
kentucky
waters.
and
if
you
choose
to
only
fish
in
ohio
waters,
you
will
only
need
an
ohio
license.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
want
to
venture
wherever
your
boat
or
the
fish
take
you,
then
you
may
need
two
licenses.
but
that
is
much
more
difficult
to
accomplish
if
the
boundary
is
a
constantly
moving
boundary
because
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
i
really
believe
that
there
are
two
principal
reasons
that
this
case
is
in
court.
one,
there
is
a
revenue
consideration,
taxes
can
be
levied
to
the
extent
there
is
property
that
is
within
your
jurisdiction,
bridge
revenues,
license
revenues
for
fishing,
boating,
matters
such
as
liquor
license
regulation
and
the
revenues
from
that
regulation
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
there
are
the
river
boats
that
at
times
do
attach
themselves
to
the
boundary,
but
those
matters
are
all
part
of
the
revenue
producing
aspects
of
this
case.
as
this
court
has
frequently
noted
in
all
boundary
cases,
there
is
the
notion
of
sovereign
jurisdiction
here,
and
each
state
obviously
feels
strongly
about
having
that
matter
finally
determined
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
no,
your
honor,
most
assuredly
mr.
ringo
and
i,
as
much
as
we
enjoy
being
here
today,
would
have
easily
passed
it
up
if
the
matter
could
have
been
resolved
short
of
this.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
do.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
in
one
proceeding
already,
a
nuclear
regulatory
commission
proceeding
which
is
referred
to
in
ohio's
brief,
the
public
service
company
of
indiana
has
already
proven
where
the
1792
low
water
mark
lies
with
respect
to
a
small
area
that
they
must
--
to
which
they
will
discharge
their
waters
from
the
plant.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
i'm
really
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
yes,
your
honor.
the
evidence
is
at
least
as
good
as
the
evidence
which
this
court
accepted
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
in
1896.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
concededly,
your
honor,
they
were
working
with
surveys
that
related
to
a
portion
of
the
indiana
boundary,
but
the
same
surveys
can
be
depended
upon,
though
those
surveys
exist,
the
1806
surveys
and
the
1896
surveys
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
your
question
indicates
to
me
that
i
have
obviously
failed
in
my
attempt
to
convince
you
that
there
is
a
fixed
boundary
and
therefore
avulsions
don't
matter.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
or
accretions.
they
are
simply
irrelevant,
as
in
the
ohio
river.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
there
is
a
second
policy
reason
that
for
consistent
i
probably
should
go
on
and
discuss
it
as
well,
and
that
is
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
is
much
more
convenient
and
therefore
less
likely
to
cause
a
great
amount
of
litigation
to
have
a
fixed
boundary,
there
is
a
more
equitable
concern
that
operates
here
today
and
that
is
with
respect
to
a
river
like
the
ohio
that
has
a
low
water
mark
as
a
boundary
and
which
has
been
dammed
so
that
the
river
is
now
much
wider
than
it
was
previously,
the
concepts
of
avulsion
and
accretion
no
longer
work,
the
compensating
theory
that
this
court
talked
about
in
bonelli
or
corvallis
is
no
longer
at
work
along
the
ohio
river.
and
so
this
reason
also
compels
the
court
to
follow
the
decisions
which
it
rendered
in
1890.
for
instance,
normally
along
any
river
that
has
a
middle
of
the
river
boundary,
if
there
is
accretion,
the
court
has
noted,
what
you
can
gain
on
the
one
hand
you
might
lose
on
the
other.
and
with
respect
to
avulsions,
there
is
really
no
relevance
because
it
fixes
the
boundary
as
of
the
avulsion.
but
what
happens
on
the
ohio
river?
it
is
a
no-win
proposition.
kentucky
takes
it
all
and
ohio
loses
it
all.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
is
that
a
middle
of
the
river
case?
i
am
not
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
therefore,
the
distinction
is
apparent.
it
is
not
a
river
like
the
ohio
where
we
are
not
working
from
the
middle
where
those
equities
can
play,
where
you
can
gain
on
the
one
hand
or
lose
on
the
other.
we
don't
gain
anything
along
the
ohio
river
if
you
happen
to
be
a
state
to
the
north
of
the
river,
and
those
traditional
principles
which
this
court
looked
at
the
underlying
reasons
for
those
principles
in
trying
to
apply
them
in
bonelli
and
corvallis.
if
you
examine
it,
it
is
a
windfall
to
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
i
do
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
but
for
a
different
set
of
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
which
would
therefore
support
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
court
held.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
right.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
there
are
additional
reasons
why
this
court
should
read
indiana
v.
kentucky
as
having
found
a
fixed
boundary.
for
instance,
again,
if
i
may
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
21,
20
and
12
of
the
exceptions
filed
by
kentucky.
first,
on
page
21,
kentucky
sets
out
the
language
that
we
all
concede
is
the
most
important
language
in
that
case
as
far
as
determining
this
question.
if
when
kentucky
became
a
state,
a
focus
on
statehood,
not
on
some
date
prior
to
an
avulsion.
on
the
first
of
june
1792,
clearly
the
date
that
kentucky
officially
became
a
state.
kentucky
concedes
that.
later
in
that
language,
that
her
jurisdiction
extended
at
that
time
--
and
the
special
master
recognized
it
--
that
can
only
refer
to
the
date
of
statehood.
thus
a
fixed
boundary,
not
a
boundary
fixed
by
avulsion,
a
fixed
boundary,
because
of
the
deed
and
the
cession,
at
that
time
was
the
low
water
mark
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
river,
and
then
some
very
important
language
in
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case,
where
the
court
said
these
rights
--
i
am
paraphrasing
today
--
these
rights
could
not
be
affected
by
any
subsequent
change
of
the
ohio
river.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
from
page
21
of
kentucky's
exceptions,
from
the
passage
that
is
quoted
from
indiana
v.
kentucky,
and
it
is
about
half-way
down
in
the
passage,
the
line
begins
"they
could
not
be
affected,"
and
i
submit
that
means
these
rights
that
kentucky
had
inherited
from
virginia
--
could
not
be
affected
by
any
subsequent
change
of
the
ohio
river.
and
the
word
"any"
includes
not
only
avulsion
changes
but
accretion
changes,
and
it
goes
on
to
say
"or
by
the
fact
that
the
channel
in
which
the
river
once
ran
is
now
filled
up
from
a
variety
of
causes,
natural
and
artificial."
now,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
language
clearly
indicates
to
this
court
that
in
1890
the
court
felt
that
this
was
a
fixed
boundary,
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
my
interpretation.
kentucky
tells
us
as
much
on
two
other
pages
in
their
exceptions.
on
page
20,
they
try
to
finesse
the
issue
when
they
say
that
the
--
they
admit
first
that
the
river
gradually
began
to
change
its
course
so
that
the
main
channel
flowed
to
the
south
of
the
island.
so
we
have
a
change
in
the
channel
which
kentucky
is
going
to
argue
was
an
avulsive
change.
and
that
is
what
they
do,
they
argue
that
the
change
in
the
ohio
river
--
now
i
am
reading
on
page
20,
about
half-way
down
the
page
--
the
change
in
the
ohio
river
around
the
island
had
been
an
avulsive
change,
a
change
in
the
bed
or
main
channel
of
the
river
itself,
and
that
is
how
they
are
going
to
define
avulsion
on
page
20.
but
if
we
look
at
page
12
of
their
exceptions,
we
find
out
that
that
is
not
an
avulsive
change.
the
court
recognized
the
long
settled
rule
that
when
the
bed
--
and
i
am
reading
from
arkansas
v.
tennessee,
the
quote
on
page
12,
about
the
fourth
or
the
fifth
or
eighth
lines
--
that
when
the
bed
and
channel
are
changed
by
the
natural
and
gradual
processes
known
as
erosion
and
accretion,
the
boundary
follows
the
varying
course
of
the
stream.
well,
clearly
if
the
court
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
held
or
noted
in
its
language
that
this
boundary
couldn't
be
changed
by
any
process,
and
kentucky's
argument
is
they
were
talking
about
an
avulsion,
they
couldn't
have
been
talking
about
an
avulsion
because
an
avulsion
doesn't
involve
a
gradual
change,
and
kentucky
admits
it
on
page
12
of
their
brief.
it
involves
a
sudden
change.
in
all
of
the
avulsion
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
there
is
a
date
that
you
can
find
in
the
opinions,
a
date
that
points
out
the
year
in
which
the
avulsion
occurred.
in
one
case,
in
missouri
v.
nebraska,
1904,
they
were
able
to
point
to
the
day,
july
5,
1867.
if
indiana
v.
kentucky
were
an
avulsion
case,
then
this
court
would
have
pointed
to
a
day
or
at
least
a
year
in
which
the
avulsion
occurred,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
pointed
to
the
date
statehend
became
official,
and
that
has
absolutely
no
relevance
to
an
avulsion
at
all.
so
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
even
on
kentucky's
brief,
this
court's
interpretation
of
indiana
--
that
the
interpretation
applied
to
indiana
v.
kentucky
in
1890
is
that
they
found
a
fixed
boundary.
the
only
way
it
could
have
been
an
avulsive
finding
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
is
if
the
definition
of
avulsion
included
a
gradual
change.
and
not
only
do
they
cite
the
case
that
shows
to
the
contrary,
but
all
of
the
other
avulsion
cases
point
out
that
it
has
to
be
a
sudden
change
and
so
do
all
of
the
treatise
writers,
and
that
simply
is
not
the
facts
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
you
do
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
well,
your
honor,
in
a
fixed
boundary
situation,
obviously
wherever
the
island
lies
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
a
fixed
line,
it
can't
be
changed.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
with
respect
to
a
middle
of
the
river
boundary
situation,
which
is
the
more
general
case,
the
nebraska
v.
iowa
case,
the
boundary
i
submit
can
and
may
change;
if
there
is
an
avulsion
it
won't,
but
if
there
is
an
accretion
it
can.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
the
second
case
was,
your
honor,
the
boundary
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
although
it
is
not
evidence
in
the
record,
we
have
the
benefit
of
a
rather
prodigious
project
by
dean
wallace,
the
former
dean
of
the
indiana
law
school
where
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
indiana
he
has
been
researching
in
great
britain
and
in
all
of
the
archives
available
in
this
country,
all
of
the
old
surveys
and
many
surveys
that
can
be
referred
to,
competent
surveyors
today
so
that
they
can
do
the
same
thing
that
was
done
in
indiana
v.
kentucky,
take
those
surveys
and
do
the
best
job
to
come
up
with
the
1792
low
water
mark,
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
river
boundary
along
the
entire
ohio,
the
ohio-kentucky
boundary
as
well.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
unfortunately,
your
honor,
it
is.
in
indiana
v.
kentucky,
this
court
in
its
decree
remanded
the
matter
to
the
three
commissioners
to
actually
locate
the
boundary,
and
the
special
master
in
this
case
recommends
to
this
court
that
if
you
approve
and
adopt
his
recommendations,
one
of
those
is
to
have
the
matter
remanded
to
him
so
that
we
can
begin
the
task
of
actually
locating
the
1792
low
water
mark.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
no.
there
is
only
one
issue
here
today,
your
honor,
and
that
is
whether
to
adopt
the
special
master's
report.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
--
i
notice
my
time
is
almost
up.
there
are
two
points
i
want
to
make
before
i
stop
talking,
and
one
is
that
there
is
only
one
issue
and
all
of
the
suggestions
by
kentucky
with
respect
to
acquiescence
is
simply
not
an
issue
before
the
special
master
and
under
the
stipulation
we
are
not
presented
--
they
are
factual
matters,
there
is
no
record
on
which
to
premise
any
findings.
the
special
master
didn't
make
any
findings
and
therefore
all
of
the
argument
that
kentucky
devotes
to
that
questions
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
proceedings
before
the
court
today.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
your
honor,
let
me
correct
my
answer
in
one
respect,
and
that
is
that
not
only
because
it
is
a
low
water
mark
but
because
that
is
what
was
apparently
intended
when
they
ceded
the
land
northwest
of
the
ohio
river.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
but
a
particular
low
water
mark.
and
the
low
water
mark
--
there
was
a
question
from
the
court
while
mr.
ringo
was
arguing
as
to
which
low
water
mark
it
is.
under
the
definitions
that
this
court
has
handed
down,
it
is
the
lowest
point
to
which
the
river
recedes
during
the
year.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
back
that
far
to
actually
fix
the
boundary.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
this
court
only
need
go
back
as
far
as
1890
because
the
decisions
of
the
court
are
already
there.
they
stand
as
stare
decisis
on
the
question
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
there
is
one
other
point
that
i
wish
to
make
and
that
is
that
kentucky
has
not
always
asserted
the
argument
that
is
before
the
court
today,
and
i
suggest
that
that
should
be
considered
when
you
try
to
determine
whether
indiana
v.
kentucky
stands
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
fixed
boundary
or
not.
in
the
answer
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
no,
your
honor,
and
unfortunately
we
are
back
to
our
original
position.
but
my
point
is
with
respect
to
indiana's
position
today,
it
is
inconsistent
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
kentucky's,
i'm
sorry
--
is
inconsistent
with
the
answer
which
they
gave
in
this
case
initially,
and
their
answer
admitted
that
it
was
a
1792
low
water
mark
but
argued
that
for
practical
reasons
you
can't
find
it
so
we
ought
to
have
a
prevailing
low
water
mark.
and
then
if
we
look
at
their
exceptions,
they
talk
about
avulsion,
36
times
they
mention
avulsion,
and
when
we
see
their
reply
brief
the
word
doesn't
appear
once,
and
i
submit
that
is
instructive,
that
they
felt
avulsion
to
argue
avulsion
was
a
weak
position
and
they
retreated
from
it.
and
that
inconsistently
should
be
considered
when
this
court
tries
to
determine
whether
to
read
indiana
v.
kentucky
--
mr.
michael
r.
szolosi
thank
you,
your
honor.
