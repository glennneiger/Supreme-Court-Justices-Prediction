mr.
james
m.
ringo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
original
action
initiated
by
ohio
in
1966
is
before
the
court
today
on
kentucky's
exceptions
to
the
report
of
a
special
master.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
location
of
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
along
the
northerly
edge
of
the
ohio
river.
ohio's
claim,
adopted
by
the
report,
is
that
the
boundary
is
a
fixed
and
static
line
located
on
the
northerly
low
water
mark
as
it
existed
in
the
year
1792.
kentucky
contends
that
the
boundary
is
the
prevailing
or
current
low
water
mark
as
it
may
exist
at
any
given
time
as
affected
by
the
processes
of
accretion
and
erosion.
this
court
in
its
1973
opinion
in
this
case
rejected
ohio's
attempt
to
amend
its
complaint
to
claim
the
middle
of
the
river
as
the
boundary
and
in
so
doing
this
court
held
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
was
the
northerly
low
water
mark.
this
was
based
on
two
grounds.
one,
ohio's
long
acquiescence
to
kentucky's
open
assertions
of
sovereignty
over
the
river,
and
the
other
was
the
court's
earlier
decision
in
handly's
lessee
v.
anthony
that
held
that
the
boundary
between
indiana
and
kentucky
is
the
river
itself,
not
the
banks
but
the
river
itself,
wherever
that
may
be
at
the
low
water
mark
on
the
northwest
edge.
that
decision
was
based
on
the
cession
made
by
virginia
and
agreed
to
by
the
united
states
in
1784.
this
court
held
that
when
virginia
ceded
its
lands
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
to
the
national
government,
she
intended
to
retain
the
entire
river
wherever
it
may
be
as
the
boundary
between
itself
and
unceded
northwest
territory.
the
river
was
to
be
a
natural
and
ever-changing
boundary
for
the
convenience
of
the
future
population
of
the
country
and
avoidance
of
controversy.
this
holding
in
handly
simply
reflects
the
universal
commonlaw
principle
applied
by
this
court
to
state
boundaries,
that
when
a
river
serves
as
a
boundary,
the
boundary
follows
the
gradual
changes
in
the
river
caused
by
accretion
and
erosion.
besides
this
general
rule
of
accretion,
there
are
two
other
general
principles
relating
to
streams
as
boundaries.
one
is
the
principle
of
avulsion,
which
is
when
the
boundary
suddenly
and
perceptibly
changes
its
old
channel
and
adopts
a
new
one,
the
boundary
remains
in
the
old
channel.
the
other
opinion
--
the
other
principle
set
forth
by
this
court
in
missouri
v.
kentucky
is
a
well-recognized
exception
to
the
rule
of
accretion
and
which
was
applied
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
it
is
the
abandoned
or
island
rule,
which
is
when
a
river
gradually
abandons
its
boundary
channel
and
shifts
around
an
island,
adopting
a
new
channel,
the
boundary
remains
in
the
original
boundary
channel.
the
result
of
this
gradual
shift
of
the
channel
of
the
river
is
the
same
as
an
avulsion.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
two
years
later,
i
believe.
the
result
of
this
gradual
shift
of
the
channel
of
the
river
is
the
same
as
an
avulsion;
that
is,
the
boundary
stays
in
the
original
channel,
but
it
differs
in
that
it
occurs
over
a
long
period
of
time,
rather
than
suddenly,
as
in
an
avulsion.
ohio's
position
in
this
case
is
based
upon
a
misconception
of
indiana
v.
kentucky
and
this
recognized
exception
to
the
rule
of
accretion
or
the
island
rule.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
right.
well,
the
island
rule
has
two
aspects;
one,
did
it
change
the
river,
and
what
is
the
ownership
or
dominion
of
the
island.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
if
the
island
belonged
to
the
state
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union,
then
no
subsequent
change
of
the
river
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
can
divest
it
of
its
sovereign
territory.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
think
that
the
best
statement
of
the
position
would
be
that
it
is
the
prevailing
low
water
mark,
wherever
it
may
be.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
well
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
a
day
to
day
change
probably
wouldn't
be
as
perceptible
as
perhaps
over
a
large
number
of
years,
the
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
if
there
happens
to
be
a
flood
or
precipitation
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
right.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
a
classic
example
of
avulsion
would
be
the
ox
bow
situation,
where
it
cuts
through
the
ox
bow.
the
boundary
remains
the
abandoned
river
resulting
from
the
cut
through
the
ox
bow.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
ohio's
position
is
based
upon
the
misconception
of
indiana
v.
kentucky
which
is
an
important
case
to
this
discussion
and
the
island
rule.
in
that
case,
it
did
not
involve
a
determination
of
the
entire
boundary
between
the
two
states.
it
involved
a
dispute
over
green
river
island,
a
2,000-acre
tract
of
land
on
the
indiana
side
of
the
ohio
river.
in
that
case,
the
court
found
that
when
kentucky
became
a
state
in
1792,
the
ohio
river
ran
in
two
channels
north
and
south
of
the
island.
the
northern
or
boundary
channel
separated
the
island
from
the
mainland
of
indiana,
but
the
river
gradually
abandoned
the
northern
channel
and
by
1816,
when
indiana
became
a
state,
the
island
had
become
attached
to
indiana.
in
applying
the
island
rule,
this
court
held
that
the
island
was
within
kentucky
when
it
became
a
state
and
that
subsequent
abandonment
of
a
boundary
channel
did
not
divest
kentucky
of
its
dominion
over
the
island.
the
boundary
remained
along
the
northern
river
watermark
of
the
river's
abandoned
channel.
thus,
indiana
v.
kentucky
fixed
only
a
land
boundary
along
along
the
abandoned
channel
and
did
not
involve
a
determination
of
the
boundary
between
two
states
along
the
remainder
of
the
entire
river.
another
misconception
ohio
has
of
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case
is
based
on
the
language
which
set
the
land
boundary
at
green
river
island
channel
as
the
low
watermark
on
the
indiana
side
of
the
north
channel
as
it
existed
in
1792.
however,
in
the
absence
of
any
accretive
or
erosive
change
in
that
channel
after
kentucky
became
a
state,
and
none
was
suggested,
the
abandoned
channel
which
existed
in
1792
continued
to
be
the
boundary.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
principle
set
forth
in
handly's
lessee
v.
anthony
continued
to
apply
along
the
remainder
of
the
original
channel.
the
river
itself,
wherever
it
may
be,
continues
to
be
the
boundary.
ohio
also
misconstrues
the
court's
language
in
that
case
that
kentucky's
jurisdiction
and
dominion
continues
as
they
existed
when
she
was
admitted
into
the
union,
unaffected
by
the
action
of
the
forces
of
nature
upon
the
course
of
the
river.
it
is
clear
from
the
context
of
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that's
true.
this
was
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
reach
at
this
very
moment.
it
is
clear,
when
they
speak
of
the
action
of
the
forces
of
nature
upon
the
river,
the
course
of
the
river,
in
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case
it
was
clear
from
the
context
of
the
court's
opinion
that
this
action
of
the
forces
of
nature
upon
the
course
of
the
river
referred
to
the
abandonment
of
a
channel,
which
would
be
the
island
example
of
an
avulsion,
and
not
to
a
gradual
change
in
the
channel
which
would
be
accretion
and
erosion
and
the
boundary
would
follow
that
change.
nothing
in
that
opinion
suggests
that
the
low
water
mark
as
it
existed
in
1792
is
of
any
significance
in
those
areas
where
the
river,
wherever
it
may
be
--
and
the
words
"wherever
it
may
be"
is
exactly
the
words
used
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
handly
--
continued
to
flow
in
its
original
channel.
ohio
cites
absolutely
no
rule
of
law
which
would
support
its
view
of
indiana
v.
kentucky,
and
we
are
aware
of
none.
the
holdings
in
handly
and
indiana
v.
kentucky
each
were
recognized
by
the
legislatures
of
indiana
and
kentucky
in
a
1943
compact
approved
by
congress.
the
compact
connected
the
terminal
points
of
the
1896
green
river
island
survey
line
of
indiana
v.
kentucky
to
the
low
water
mark
constituting
the
remainder
of
the
boundary.
this
acknowledged
that
the
boundary
line
is
the
river,
wherever
it
may
be
at
the
prevailing
low
water
mark
on
the
northerly
edge
as
set
forth
in
handly,
and
that
the
holding
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
was
limited
to
the
fixing
of
a
land
boundary
along
the
fill
channel
north
of
green
river
island.
in
addition
to
all
of
this,
kentucky
has
openly
maintained
for
almost
200
years
that
its
boundary
extends
to
the
prevailing
or
current
low
water
mark
at
its
northerly
edge.
such
has
been
done
through
its
legislative
and
judicial
assertions
of
sovereignty
over
the
river.
this
has
been
expressly
recognized
not
only
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court
but
by
the
courts
of
ohio,
indiana,
illinois
and
kentucky.
to
adopt
ohio's
position
would
completely
ignore
the
assertion
of
virginia
to
retain
the
river
itself
wherever
that
may
be
as
a
natural
and
living
boundary
and
the
united
states
agreement
to
accept
that
assertion.
a
1792
line
would
be
unrealistic.
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense
to
make
a
natural
river
a
boundary
and
expect
it
to
remain
a
fixed
and
beautiful
line.
thus,
no
matter
from
what
viewpoint
this
case
is
considered,
the
result
indicated
is
the
same
-
history,
legal
precedent
and
common
understand
all
support
the
continuation
of
the
natural
boundary
of
the
river's
northerly
edge
at
the
prevailing
low
water
mark.
in
the
more
than
thirteen
years
since
this
case
has
been
pending,
ohio
has
been
unable
to
cite
to
this
court
any
rule
which
would
warrant
adoption
of
the
1792
low
water
mark
as
the
boundary.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
decree
should
be
entered
providing
that
the
boundary
between
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
is
the
prevailing
low
water
mark
on
the
northerly
edge
of
the
ohio
river
as
it
existed
at
any
given
time.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
address
is
this
misunderstanding
as
to
the
distinction
between
the
use
of
the
word
avulsion
and
in
our
reply
brief
the
absence
of
the
word
avulsion,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
distinction
between
the
general
principle
of
an
avulsion,
which
is
a
certainly
perceptible
change
that
the
boundary
remains
in
an
abandoned
channel.
the
island
rule
recognizes
the
exception
to
the
rule
of
accretion.
it
has
the
same
result
as
an
avulsion,
but
it
happens
very
gradually
and
it
is
the
very
same
thing
that
happened
in
the
missouri
v.
kentucky
case
involving
a
dispute
over
wolf
island
which
was
an
island
of
some
15,000
acres.
when
kentucky
was
admitted
to
the
union,
first
of
all,
the
boundary
between
kentucky
and
missouri
was
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river.
when
kentucky
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
main
channel
ran
west
of
the
island
and
therefore
the
island
was
within
kentucky's
jurisdiction.
but
by
the
time
of
the
dispute,
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
had
changed
and
shifted
and
ran
east
of
the
island
and
therefore
putting
at
that
time
wolf
island
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
channel,
but
the
court
held
that
the
subsequent
change
of
the
channel
did
not
divest
kentucky
of
its
sovereign
territory
of
wolf
island,
and
this
is
the
same
principle
that
was
applied
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
well,
the
reason
we
discuss
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
but
that
is
the
reason
i
discussed
missouri
v.
kentucky,
because
that
principle
which
we
are
calling
the
island
principle,
rather
than
avulsion
because
in
looking
through
all
the
cases
of
avulsion
it
always
involves
a
sudden
and
perceptible
change,
but
this
was
a
result
that
was
the
same,
so
since
it
wasn't
sudden
and
perceptible
it
differs
from
avulsion.
but
the
reason
that
we
mention
missouri
v.
kentucky,
that
is
precisely
the
principle
that
the
court
relied
upon
in
indiana
v.
kentucky.
it
states
the
principles
and
then
cites
that
principle,
whether
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river
or
the
law
water
mark
that
is
in
the
kentucky
case.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
first
you
must
look
at
the
context
of
the
case.
it
was
a
dispute
over
green
river
island,
that
2,000-acre
tract
of
land.
the
jurisdiction
that
were
talking
about
was
jurisdiction
remaining
over
that
island.
it
was
not
discussing
the
entire
river
or
the
entire
state.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
okay.
now
this
is
the
point
i
tried
to
make
earlier,
that
it
is
clear
from
the
context
of
that
portion
of
the
court's
opinion,
that
this
referred
to
the
island
rule
exception,
that
they
were
discussing
an
abandonment
of
this
northern
channel,
did
not
strip
or
divest
kentucky
of
this
island.
another
important
point
is
that
the
opinion
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
did
not
refer
to
changes
in
the
remainder
of
the
course,
it
was
consistent
with
the
policies
of
handly's
lessee
v.
anthony.
going
back
to
an
earlier
question
of
the
court,
we
look
to
the
cession
which
determined
the
boundary
and
how
the
river
was
to
be
perceived
as
a
boundary.
the
cession
fixed
the
river
as
a
natural,
ever-changing
boundary
subject
to
accretion,
and
it
mentioned
in
the
opinion
that
the
states
had
the
right
to
it
and
if
there
was
an
accretion
to
the
indiana
side
then
the
accretion
would
belong
to
indiana.
to
accept
ohio's
position,
you
fix
the
1792
line
and
locate
it
wherever
it
happens
to
be
located,
we
can
assume
that
this
is
a
natural
river
and
accretions
have
occurred.
any
accretion
that
has
occurred
north
of
the
1792
low
water
mark
now
would
not
belong
to
indiana,
ohio,
or
illinois,
but
would
belong
to
kentucky,
and
you
would
have
situations
where
you
would
have
the
river
in
kentucky
and
ohio
or
indiana
and
it
would
cause
additional
problems
and
this
is
exactly
the
reason
that
virginia
retained
the
river
itself
as
a
natural
river,
because
no
matter
what
the
decision
of
this
court
is
or
the
arguments
of
counsel,
the
river
will
continue
to
go
through
its
natural
processes
of
adjustment
which
will
be
through
accretion
and
erosion,
and
to
do
anything
to
the
contrary
would
defeat
or
defy
the
terms
of
virginia's
cession
of
the
national
government
and
the
government's
exception
of
that
cession.
that
is
all
i
have,
your
honor,
except
i
do
have
--
there
are
some
eighth
circuit
cases
concerning
this
island
rule
which
i
did
not
put
in
my
brief
and
in
fairness
to
the
court
i
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
--
if
you
are
going
to
follow
the
traditional
rules
that
have
been
set
forth
by
this
court
and
adopted
by
this
court
in
its
federal
common
law,
whose
ox
is
being
gored
is
not
in
question.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
if
it
can
be
determined.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
it
is
not
in
evidence.
it
possibly
could
be,
but
kentucky
does
not
admit
this.
there
are
some
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
