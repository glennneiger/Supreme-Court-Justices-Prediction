that
is
what
i
thought
your
point
was,
mr.
szolosi,
that
while
you
concede
the
general
applicability
of
the
common
law
rules
of
accretion
and
avulsion
with
respect
to
a
typical
boundary,
which
is
the
middle
of
the
river,
that
this
is
an
atypical
boundary
depending,
as
it
does,
upon
the
origins
of
the
state
of
kentucky
and
the
origins
of
the
northwest
territory
part
of
which
became
the
state
of
ohio,
and
that
with
respect
to
this
atypical
boundary
it
is
the
1792
line
that
is
the
line,
quite
regardless
of
any
subsequent
avulsion
or
accretion,
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all
because
of
the
language
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
confirmed
by
two
decisions
of
this
court
and
embodied
today
in
the
master's
report.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
making
that
point
to
support
your
argument
that
the
1792
boundary
is
the
applicable
boundary
and
that
that
decision
in
this
court
cannot
be
explained
in
terms
of
avulsion
but
can
be
explained
only
in
terms
of
the
1792
boundary?
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
your
argument
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
when
it
goes
back
to
the
master,
if
we
agree
with
you
and
if
we
agree
with
the
special
master's
report,
and
if
this
goes
back
to
him,
then,
as
the
chief
justice
says,
the
question
will
be
where
was
the
1792
low
water
mark
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
is
your
boundary.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
both
parties
agreed
that
the
low
water
mark
in
1792
was
lower
than
it
now
is
and
that
it
is
now
higher
as
a
result
of
the
activities
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
