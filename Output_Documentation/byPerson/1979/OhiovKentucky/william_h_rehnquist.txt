justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nebraska
v.
iowa
came
after
that
case,
did
it
not?
it
was
decided
later.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
concede,
i
take
it,
that
if
there
had
been
an
avulsive
change
in
the
ohio
river
such
that
it
wasn't
gradual
but
a
sudden
shift,
that
that
would
change
the
boundary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
colleague
white
is
right
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
you
say
in
handly's
lessee
that
the
principle
is
that
the
river,
however
it
may
change,
continues
to
be
the
boundary.
now,
if
it
changes
by
avulsion,
as
my
colleague
white
said,
the
river
would
no
longer
continue
to
be
the
boundary,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
szolosi,
are
you
going
sometime
during
your
argument
to
address
the
language
of
justice
brewer
in
ohio
v.
nebraska
on
page
143
of
370
which
i
am
about
to
quote
to
you,
that
not
only
in
respect
to
the
rights
of
individual
landowners
but
also
in
respect
to
the
boundary
lines
between
the
states,
the
law
of
accretion
controls?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
we
are
talking
about
basically
a
factual
situation
and
that
is
whether
the
course
of
the
ohio
river
between
ohio
and
kentucky
changed,
if
it
did
change
by
avulsion
or
accretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
justice
brewer's
language
much
later
or
at
least
two
years
later
in
nebraska
v.
iowa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
have
an
avulsion
at
one
point
in
the
river,
say,
between
ohio
and
kentucky,
and
nonetheless
any
changes
in
the
river
between
ohio
and
kentucky
as
opposed
to
indiana
and
kentucky
could
be
purely
accredit
and
you
could
have
two
different
results
under
nebraska
v.
iowa,
couldn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
did
you
have
to
go
into
green
island
and
the
abandonment
of
the
channel
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
the
line
was
fixed
by,
in
effect,
metes
and
bounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that,
you
say,
was
simply
a
different
situation
than
nebraska
v.
iowa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
it
was
the
indiana
public
service
company
that
had
produced
the
evidence.
was
that
as
to
the
boundary
between
indiana
and
kentucky
or
the
boundary
between
ohio
and
kentucky?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
have
had
an
avulsion
or
an
accretion
where
the
river
runs
between
ohio
and
kentucky
and
not
one
where
it
runs
between
indiana
and
kentucky.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
it
doesn't
make
--
that
the
principle,
the
general
principle
doesn't
apply
on
the
ohio
river
because
of
the
findings
of
the
earlier
court
in
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
true
with
respect
to
the
arizona-california
boundary
made
by
the
colorado
river.
there
have
been
four
sets
of
dams
in
that
river
and
yet
it
is
recognized
that
if
there
is
an
accretion,
the
state
that
gets
the
land
gets
the
boundary
change,
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nebraska
v.
iowa
came
along
a
long
time
before
either
bonelli
or
corvallis
and
it
simply
stated
a
general
rule.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
simply
saying
that
where
the
granting
state
says
it
isn't
the
middle
of
the
river,
all
of
the
river
belongs
to
us,
and
it
is
the
low
water
mark
on
the
other
side,
that
the
accretion-avulsion
rule
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
why
that
follows
at
all.
i
can
see
why
it
would
be
a
different
point
that
you
look
to
for
accretion
and
avulsion,
but
i
can't
see
why
the
general
rule
of
accretion-avulsion
wouldn't
apply.
i
don't
see
why
that
is
any
more
of
a
fixed
boundary
point
than
the
fixed
boundary
point
between
nebraska
and
iowa.
