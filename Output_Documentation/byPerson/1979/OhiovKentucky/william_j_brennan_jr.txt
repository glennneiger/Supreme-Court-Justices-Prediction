justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
are
suggesting
that
the
regular
rule
is
that
no
one
loses
title,
or
a
boundary
doesn't
change
with
respect
to
an
island?
whether
there's
an
avulsion
or
whether
it's
gradual?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
general
ringo,
is
it
kentucky's
position
that
the
boundary
is
at
the
low
water
mark
on
the
ohio
side
on
any
particular
day?
just
from
day
to
day
that
it
might
change?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
change?
might
that
change
from
day
to
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
from
year
to
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perceptible
or
not,
it
might
change
in
24
hours,
might
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
is
kentucky's
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
you
familiar
with
texas
v.
louisiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
another
atypical
boundary
between
two
states,
depending
on
the
specific
words
of
some
treaties
that
overrode
any
ordinary
rule
about
the
boundaries
between
two
states.
there
it
was
just
the
middle
of
the
river,
rather
than
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
and
based
on
the
word
that
control
where
the
boundary
was
originally
created,
that
was
the
rule,
regardless
of
the
general
rule
about
accretion
and
avulsion
and
things
like
that.
but
your
point
is
that
the
words
of
the
grant
fixed
the
boundary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
practical
results
of
your
position?
does
a
fisherman
have
to
have
licenses
from
both
states
because
if
the
old
line
is
now
under
water,
how
does
he
know
whether
he
is
in
ohio
or
in
kentucky?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
that
would
be
the
rule
if
the
ordinary
rule
of
boundary
lines
applied,
namely
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
go
back
to
my
illustration
of
the
fisherman.
do
you
have
a
little
string
of
lights
out
in
the
river
so
he
knows
whether
he
is
in
kentucky
or
in
ohio?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
has
he
got
two
licenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
really
is
this
case
all
about?
what
is
the
value
for
which
each
of
you
is
contesting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
saloons
out
in
the
middle
of
the
river
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
like
to
litigate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
concede
that
is
the
general
rule,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
assert
that
this
is
a
special
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
texas
v.
louisiana,
the
case
i
mentioned
to
you,
came
a
long
time
after
the
nebraska
case
and
yet
it
said
that
a
general
rule
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
specifics
of
the
creation
of
the
boundary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
to
cross
two
bridges,
i
gather.
one
is
that
this
isn't
a
middle
of
the
river
case,
it
is
a
low
water
mark
case,
but
then
you
have
to
cross
the
other
bridge
that
it
is
the
low
water
mark
at
the
time
of
admission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
where
you
rely
on
the
cases
in
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
an
unchanging
low
water
mark.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
also
indiana
v.
kentucky
was
decided
the
same
day
as
plessie
v.
ferguson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
case,
that
is
when
the
decree
came
down.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
--
plessie
has
been
overruled.
do
you
think
we
should
overrule
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
go
back
to
the
practical
problem
for
a
minute.
i
guess
you
mentioned
the
power
company
has
a
survey
of
a
very
small
portion
of
this
boundary.
are
there
surveys
in
existence
for
this
entire
--
it
is
a
rather
long
boundary
between
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
within
the
scope
of
this
litigation
to
fight
out
all
the
details
of
that
for
the
whole
length
of
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
not
within
the
scope
wherefore
of
any
issues
now
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
it
is
a
1792
low
mark.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
in
that
earlier
case
it
didn't
involve
the
ohio
river,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
didn't
involve
a
boundary
that
concededly
now
is
from
the
low
water
mark,
the
north
low
water
mark?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ringo,
what
is
your
response
to
this
language
in
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case
where
the
court
says
that
if
when
kentucky
became
a
state
on
the
first
of
june
1792,
the
waters
of
the
ohio
river
ran
between
that
tract
known
as
green
river
island
and
the
main
body
of
the
state
of
indiana,
and
her
right
to
it
falls
from
the
fact
that
her
jurisdiction
extended
at
that
time
to
the
low
water
mark
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
river.
now,
that
says
the
boundary
between
the
state
is
the
low
water
mark.
then
it
says
she
succeeded
to
the
ancient
right
and
possession
of
virginia
and
they
could
not
be
affected
by
any
subsequent
change
of
the
ohio
river
or
by
the
fact
that
the
channel
in
which
the
river
once
ran
is
now
filled
up
from
a
variety
of
causes,
natural
or
artificial.
now,
doesn't
that
just
say
in
plain
words
that
it
is
the
north,
it
is
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
and
that
the
north
low
water
mark
--
the
boundary
doesn't
change
by
changes
in
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
court
goes
on
and
says
her
dominion
and
jurisdiction
continue
as
they
existed
at
the
time
she
was
admitted
to
the
union,
unaffected
by
the
action
of
the
forces
of
nature
upon
the
course
of
the
river.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ringo,
unless
you
know
where
the
1792
low
water
mark
is
all
along
the
river,
unless
you
know
that
now
and
have
it
in
your
mind,
you
really
don't
know
whose
ox
is
going
to
be
gored
with
this
line,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
with
you,
but
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
you
don't
know,
do
you
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
it
is
irrelevant,
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
clear
what
the
result
would
be
in
this
case.
