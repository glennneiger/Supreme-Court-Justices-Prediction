do
you
have
dependable
evidence
as
to
where
the
boundary
was
in
1792?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
it
generally?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
full
length
of
the
river
between
these
two
states,
roughly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
are
suggesting
there
is
evidence
that
would
enable
the
definite
establishment
of
a
boundary
for
the
full
length
of
the
river
between
the
two
states
200
years
ago?

well
this
case
is
a
boundary
dispute
between
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
it
began
in
1966
when
ohio
filed
a
complaint
under
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
to
establish
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
at
the
northerly
edge
of
the
ohio
river
as
it
has
existed
in
1792
when
kentucky
was
admitted
to
the
union.
kentucky
by
its
answer
took
the
position
that
the
boundary
line
is
the
current
low
watermark
on
the
northerly
side
of
the
river.
later,
ohio
moved
to
amend
its
complaint
to
assert
that
the
boundary
was
the
middle
of
the
river.
in
1973,
argument
was
heard
on
that
issue
and
we
denied
the
motion.
and
the
case
thus
reverted
to
its
original
posture
namely
that
the
northern
edge
of
the
river
is
the
line
alright
but
that
the
parties
disagree
as
to
whether
it
was
the
1792
line
or
the
current
and
changing
line.
the
special
master
has
filed
his
report
recommending
the
1792
line.
we
agree
with
the
special
master.
we
therefore
overrule
the
exceptions,
adopt
the
master's
report
and
remand
the
case
to
him
for
the
preparation
and
submission
of
an
appropriate
form
of
decree.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
