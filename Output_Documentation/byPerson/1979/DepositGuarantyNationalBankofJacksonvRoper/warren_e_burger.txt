you

meanwhile,
i
assume,
unless
the
--
the
other
members
of
the
potential
class
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers,
would
not
have
known
anything
about

its

is
that
correct?

what
you're
saying

i'll
put
it
this

is
what
you
are
saying
and
that
what
should
be
done
is
that
if
these
class

people
or
if
the
lawyers
sponsoring
the
litigation
want
to
have

wanted
continuing,
they
should
go
out
and
drum
up
another
plaintiff.
chief

warren
e.

is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief

but
isn't
that
the
realistic
aspect
of

of
great

necessarily
this
one

any
category

mr.

you

from

people
they

don't

well
--
chief

e.

there's
nothing

i'll
put

question

what
is
there
in

suggest
this
fiduciary
concept

if
there

if

if
that's
the
concept,
then
it
may
have
been

it
might
be
that
making
a
settlement

moot
the

now,

i'm

speaking

speaking

if
settlement
is
made

people
get

whatever.
on

they
might

well,
before

after?
chief

but
all
this

hypothetical

would
you

venture
a
guess

to
how
many
of

90,000

about
