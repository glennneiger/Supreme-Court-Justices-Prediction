except
because
there
was
no
certification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the
plaintiff
ever
have
a
right
to
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
request
for
class
certification
and
is
(voice
overlap)
--
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
ever
have
such
a
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
he
wins
the
lawsuit?
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
he
--
he
--
that
his
request
is
denied,
then
what
is
his
--
what
is
he
motivated
to
do?
should
he
try
and
win
his
individual
claim?
i
assume
he
should
and
if
he
wins
on
his
individual
claim,
does
he
lose
the
right
to
appeal
the
denial
of
the
class
certification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
could
he
--
what
is
his
motivation
at
that
point
if
he's
lost
on
the
class
certification?
i
guess
it's
in
his
interest
then
try
not
to
win
his
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
individual
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
then
have
to
assume
he
has
no
separate
legal
interest
in
representing
a
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
incorrect.
mr.
goodman,
that
isn't
really
correct
as
to
what
say
we're
claiming.
weren't
they
from
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
making
two
separate
claims;
one,
that
they're
entitled
to
$12
a
piece
or
whatever
it
was,
or
hundred
and
--
i
forgot
the
dollar
and
secondly,
that
they
were
entitled
to
represent
a
large
group
of
persons
who
had
similar
claims.
didn't
they
make
both
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
--
they
got
half
of
it
when
you
tendered
them
the
money
but
they've
never
gotten,
the
first
thing
they
asked,
namely
the
right
to
represent
everybody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
did
they
lose
that
right?
when
did
they
lose
the
right
to
assert
that
they
had
a
right
to
represent
everybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
when
did
that
the
question
become
moot,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
could
represent
a
class,
when
did
that
become
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
plaintiffs
contended
because
they
rejected
your
tender.
they
said,
"we
don't
want
your
money,
we
still
want
to
try
and
represent
a
class
as
we
have
from
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit."
the
only
thing
that's
happened
is
that
insofar
as
we
claim
wrongdoing
in
money,
they've
acknowledged
we're
right.
so
why
should
that
cause
them
to
forfeit
their
right
to
litigate
the
other
half
of
their
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
individual
controversy
but
not
the
--
not
the
controversy
concerning
their
claimed
right
to
represent
this
class.
when
did
that
become
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
so
you
could've
sent
them
the
money
but
before
even
the
class
certification
issue
arose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would've
become
moot
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not
give
the
appellate
court
the
same
right
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
goodman,
if
you're
talking
in
terms
of
power,
i
don't
understand
why
a
tender
before
the
issue
of
certification
is
even
presented
at
the
trial
judge,
wouldn't
equally
moot
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
if
you
have
made
the
argument
that
it
would.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
argument
you're
making
that
whenever
the
tender
is
made
to
an
individual
claimant,
if
there
had
been
no
certification,
there's
nothing
more
to
litigate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
logically,
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
logically,
that
distinction
is
the
same
whether
it's
--
whether
it's
before
presentation
of
certification
or
an
erroneous
denial
of
certification.
logically,
you
get
the
same
mootness
problem
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
we
carry
--
if
we
accept
your
argument,
carry
to
a
logical
conclusion,
i
think
we
should
equally
have
to
hold
and
maybe
we
should,
that
the
defendant
can
run
in
before
--
as
soon
as
the
complainants
filed
and
pay
off
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
--
you'd
defeat
a
lot
of
class
actions
that
way
and
people
get
their
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
thing
you're
doing
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
couldn't
have
appealed
the
class
certification
issue
until
the
case
was
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
won
the
case,
he'd
lose
his
right
to
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lyons
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lyons,
apart
from
cases
involving
short
time
in
the
doctrine
of
evading
review
--
i
--
i
forgot
the
exact
language,
apart
from
those
cases,
has
the
court
ever
squarely
held
that
a
tender
in
advance
of
an
attempt
to
certify
will
not
moot
a
case
in
a
class
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
logically,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
we
really
--
that's
sort
of
a,
the
bedrock
of
the
whole
argument
is
whether
a
tender
even
then
might
moot
it
because
i
think
their
argument
applying
advanced,
simple
certification
as
well
after
and
he
doesn't
want
to
press
that
because
i
know
it's
an
extreme
position,
but
don't
you
have
to
start
from
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
prior
to
certification
even
though
the
named
plaintiff
has
been
tendered
all
he's
asked
and
therefore,
he's
no
longer
a
good
class
representative,
would
be
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
--
it's
certifiable
but
10
days
after
the
lawsuit
starts,
the
named
plaintiff
has
tendered
as
$300
or
whatever
it
is.
now,
he's
happy.
if
he
refuses
that
tender,
how
can
he
be
a
good
class
representative
anymore?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
he
--
he's
--
because
he's
--
he's
no
longer
--
is
shown
he's
not
really
interested
in
his
own
claim
anymore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
still
try
--
i
must
confess,
i'm
little
troubled
by
mr.
justice
white's
example.
in
terms
of
article
iii,
why
is
there
such
a
difference
between
going
into
the
bank
informally
and
say,
"pay
us
off
now
and
we
won't
sue
you"
and
then
there's
--
there's
no
lawsuit.
they
obvious
can't
come
in
the
next
day
and
represent
the
class
and
paying
him
off
three
days
after
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
why
didn't
that
moot
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
because
it's
voluntarily
ceasing
illegal
conduct.
they
say
we
think
we've
done
everything
lawful
all
along
but
we
want
to
get
out
of
your
hair
and
so
we're
going
to
pay
you
off
and
you
can't
sue
us
anymore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
then,
how
do
we
have
a
live
case
of
controversy
that
can
even
be
certified?
