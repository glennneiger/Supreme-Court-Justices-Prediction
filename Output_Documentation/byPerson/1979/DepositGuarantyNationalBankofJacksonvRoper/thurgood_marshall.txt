that
i
don't
know
whether
you
said
or
not,
nobody
tried
to
intervene.
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
or
after
up
until
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
goodman
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
--
i
don't
get
it.
he
didn't
accept
this.
he
didn't
agree
to
this,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
way
thing
i
read
that
in
the
opinion
--
indeed,
the
opinion
in
this
case
said
that
they
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
the
whole
point
is,
if
that
was
all
of
their
claim,
if
you
take
the
class
action
out
and
the
only
thing
they're
entitled
to
is
800
to
400,
then
they
have
great
trouble
with
excess
of
10,000,
don't
they?
but,
the
other
point
is
that
they
didn't
agree
that
that's
what
the
facts
were.
now,
what's
behind
that?
did
--
did
that
--
the
statement
he
made
in
the
opinion
that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
agree
with
this,
the
appellants
do
not
agree
with
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lyons,
let
me
get
to
this
another
way.
i'm
confused.
look,
you
--
you
write
to
bank
and
you
say,
"look,
if
you
don't
pay
me
my
money
that
you
owe
me,
i'm
going
to
sue
you"
and
the
bank
says,
"okay,
i'll
pay."
you
don't
have
any
suit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
filed
a
lawsuit
and
ten
after
you
have
filed
it
the
bank
comes
in
and
says,
"we
will
pay
you."
are
you
still
going
for
your
class
action?
you
have
a
right
for
your
transaction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
trouble
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
somebody
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
a
member
of
the
class
have
intervened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
said
--
(voice
overlap)
it
wasn't
to
destroy
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
somebody
intervened
and
won't
let
them
pay
them
off.
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
class
action
was
just
a
procedure.
it
--
it
has
no
jurisdictional
value
at
all,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
why
i'm
wondering
when
a
fiduciary
thing
gets
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is,
is
that
before
or
after
the
class
is
certified,
that's
my
point
that
the
fiduciary
part
comes
in.
the
--
does
--
is
there
before
it'd
certified?
