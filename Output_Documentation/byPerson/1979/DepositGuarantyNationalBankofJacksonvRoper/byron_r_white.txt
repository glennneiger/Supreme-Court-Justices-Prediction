justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
take
it
in
mcdonald.
named
--
the
class
action
denied,
the
plaintiff
recovers
--
whatever
he
wanted
and
he's
paid
off
and
at
that
moment,
you
would
think
that
he
had
no
--
later,
no
more
interest
in
the
case.
intervenor
comes
in
and
he's
permitted
to
appeal
the
denial
of
class
action,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
there's
no
intervenor
but
that
the
named
plaintiffs
want
to
appeal
it
on
behalf
of
the
class,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
and
you
say
that
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
it
because
the
named
plaintiff's
interest
is
over,
it's
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
mcdonald,
i
would
think
as
soon
as
the
named
plaintiffs
had
been
paid
off,
his
case
was
moot
in
mcdonald
and
the
case
was
moot.
it
was
just
as
dead
as
a
doornail
at
least
as
dead
as
this
one
and
yet,
the
intervenor
wasn't
permitted
to
appeal.
so,
why
shouldn't
the
named
plaintiffs
be
permitted
to
appeal
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
a
live
controversy
--
because
of
the
--
the
named
plaintiffs
into
--
the
named
plaintiff
was
out
of
the
case.
he
was
--
because
his
case
was
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
had
never
been
a
certified
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
dissent
said
that
the
majority
was
quite
wrong
in
saying
that,
but
the
majority
stepped
right
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
right
to
intervene
during
the
trial
was
to
try
his
own
case
like
the
named
plaintiff
was
trying.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there,
there
was
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
judgment
entered
there
and
there
was
a
--
and
so
that
the
--
the
intervention
didn't
occur
until
after
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
--
your
--
you've
--
you
go
to
the
bank
and
you
say
you've
been
violating
the
usury
laws.
"why
don't
you
pay
us
all
off?"
and
the
bank
says,
"well,
we'll
think
about
it"
and
you
say,
"well,
you
better
because
i'm
going
to
sue
you."
so
they
call
you
up
and
say,
"well,
we're
going
to
pay
you.
we'll
pay
you.
your
--
your
two
--
you've
got
two
clients,
we'll
pay
both
of
your
clients."
and
you
say,
"well,
i'm
awfully
happy
about
that.
please
pay
us
and
then
i'm
going
to
file
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
clients"
and
i
don't
suppose
you
could
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
have
your
own
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
the
day
after
as
soon
as
you
file,
the
day
you
file,
you
--
you're
no
longer
subject
to
being
picked
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
say
you
have
the
--
you
have
the
right
to
have
that
issue
finally
decided
on
appeal
whether
you're
picked
off
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
the
case
starts,
the
case
can't
be
possibly
be
mooted
by
being
paid
off
or
your
recovering
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
--
even
if
the
case
as
other
--
might
otherwise
be
called
moot,
it
just
isn't
moot
for
the
class
on
the
class
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
and
i
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
are
paid
off,
you
file
a
suit,
class
action
is
denied
and
then
you're
paid
off.
and
then
you
go
out
and
that
you
file
a
separate
suit
on
behalf
of
the
class,
you'll
be
thrown
out
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
the
--
but
you
have
standing
to
maintain
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
old
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
suggesting
that
he
say
they
--
they
just
didn't
pay
off
everybody
but
are
--
are
you
suggesting
as
they
admitted
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
thought.
so
you
don't
--
i
mean
a
lot
of
people
pay
plaintiffs
off
just
to
get
rid
of
a
lawsuit
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
they'd
rather
--
they'd
rather
pay
than
litigate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
--
i
know
but
they
didn't
admit
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
they
may
not
have
been
in
--
in
the
long
run,
you
may
lose
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
so
you
may
not
have
been
entitled
to
your
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you
one
thing?
could
--
could
the
defendant
have
insisted
on
having
the
case
dismissed
if
you
--
where
he
tenders
a
settlement
and
you
refuse
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
status
of
the
named
plaintiffs'
case
now
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
what
happened
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
what
have
you
tried
to
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
appeal
with
dismissal?
