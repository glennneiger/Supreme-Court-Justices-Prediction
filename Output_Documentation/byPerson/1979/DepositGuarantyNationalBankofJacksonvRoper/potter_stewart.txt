well,
that
--
that
question
as
i
understand
in
view
of
our
limited
grant,
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
us
here
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
or
wrong
in
the
merits
of
the
class
action.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
--
that
was
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
opinion
written
by
judge
rubin
but
it
wasn't
necessarily
the
theory
of
judge
thornberry
and
yet,
it's
not
one
that
you
have
to
adopt.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
a
matter
of
(voice
overlap)
or
voluntary
action.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
do
you
--
you
don't
need
to
contend
that
you
had
a
duty
to
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeal
held
that
you
did.
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
privilege,
an
option
not
a
right.
