justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goodman,
you
referred
to
our
previous
cases
and
certainly
in
cases
like
jacobs
and
sosna
and
franks
and
united
airlines
and
rodriguez,
we
have
dealt
with
various
trees
in
the
class
action
for
us.
do
you
think
all
of
our
cases
are
reconcilable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
--
in
the
intervenor
in
--
in
effect
didn't
have
to
bring
a
class
action.
the
intervenor
could've
brought
a
simple
action
on
her
own
behalf.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
mcdonald
must
mean
that
not
only
is
the
controversy
revolving
around
a
--
an
amount
of
money
due
justiciable
but
that
there
is
an
additional
element,
the
right
to
bring
a
class
action
which
is
also
a
judicial
--
justiciable
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
--
what
about
judge
thornberry's
concurrence
in
the
fifth
circuit
saying
that
if
the
named
plaintiffs
had
accepted
the
tender,
that's
all
a
court
had
to
decide
--
had
to
--
to
--
the
court
didn't
have
to
decide
what
the
question
would
be
then.
these
named
plaintiffs
had
refused
the
tender.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
goodman
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goodman,
don't
--
don't
you
really
have
to
get
down
a
little
deeper
than
perhaps
this
court
has
in
some
of
its
class
action
cases
here
and
recognize
that
at
least
many
courts
have
read
into
rule
23
that
it's
--
it's
basically
a
case
managed
not
by
clients
but
by
lawyers
and
that
the
clients
themselves
probably
couldn't
care
less
about
giving
$12
a
piece
from
the
bank
and
that
somehow
rather
--
whether
it's
--
as
justice
stevens
says
the
other
half
of
the
issue
or
at
least
another
part
of
the
issue;
one
is
whether
each
client
will
recover
particular
sum
of
money
and
the
other
of
which
is
whether
a
rather
large
class
which
will
furnish
a
rather
large
attorney's
fee
to
attorneys
will
be
certified
or
will
not
be
certified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lyons,
isn't
that
exactly
of
why
we
have
to
explore
here
not
just
the
recovery
of
individual
plaintiffs
but
whether
in
--
in
adopting
rule
23,
it
was
intended
to
confer
not
only
the
right
to
litigate
about
individual
claims,
but
about
the
right
to
litigate
whether
or
not
a
class
should
be
certified
as
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
--
that's
a
capable
of
--
of
that
of
grant
petition
but
evading
review
type
of
situation
where
you're
not
seeking
a
money
judgment.
you're
seeking
relief
which
the
particular
named
plaintiff
may
not
ever
be
able
to
obtain
because
of
the
--
and
it's
a
durational
residency
requirement.
i
have
trouble
with
transferring
that
over
into
the
simple
money
judgment
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
won't
be
--
it
won't
be
moot
as
to
people
who
have
not
filed
unless
there's
been
an
intervening
event,
the
statute
of
limitation
in
this,
not
a
question
of
mootness,
it's
a
question
of
the
bank
having
an
affirmative
substantive
defense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
upon
timely
intervention.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
a
pick
off
system,
it
--
couldn't
you
equally
well
refer
to
as
a
system
of
a
defendant
settling
with
plaintiffs
who
present
their
claims.
i
mean
i
--
it
all
depends
on
how
you
couch
the
language,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
position
consistent
with
jacobs
versus
the
indianapolis
school
board,
do
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
pray
for
certification
in
your
complaint
then
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
in
order
to
harmonize
it
with
jacobs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
refer
to
the
doctrine
relation
back,
are
you
referring
to
sosna?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
though,
that
simply
left
the
question
open,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
--
those
are
the
kind
of
open
questions
that
we've
got
to
decide
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
or
put
to
one
side
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
since
wt
grant
on
its
head
to
say
that
paying
a
money
judgment
is
a
voluntary
cessation
of
illegal
conduct.
that's
always
been
in
the
injunctive
context
before.
