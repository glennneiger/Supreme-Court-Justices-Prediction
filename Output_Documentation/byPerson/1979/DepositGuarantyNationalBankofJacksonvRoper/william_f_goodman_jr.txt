mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
rule
23
cases
somehow
tend
to
evoke
emotional
and
hypothetical
arguments
from
both
sides.
i
will
try
to
avoid
such
arguments
insofar
as
possible.
i
will
try
to
deal
with
the
realities
of
this
case
on
its
merits
because
my
hope
is
to
persuade
this
court
to
deal
with
this
case
in
the
same
manner.
very
briefly,
two
credit
card
holders
sued
the
bank
in
1971.
the
district
court
denied
certification
in
october,
1975.
interlocutory
appeal
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
december,
1975.
over
seven
months
later,
the
bank
tendered
to
the
two
plaintiffs
all
that
they
demanded
and
the
litigation
was
concluded.
an
appeal
was
then
attempted
on
behalf
of
the
unnamed
and
uncertified
class
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
rejecting
the
mootness
concept
and
went
further
to
order
certification,
hence
this
petition.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor
but
we
do
know
this
that
from
1971
to
the
present
day,
according
to
the
record,
not
a
single
other
customer
of
the
bank
has
filed
suit,
joined
this
suit,
sought
to
intervene
or
made
a
complaint.
from
1971
to
1979,
not
a
single,
other
customer
has
done
any
of
those
things.
that
we
know
from
the
record.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
of
course
my
response
to
that,
your
honor
would
be
that
it
was
not
certified.
it
was
simply
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
and
--
and
entitled
the
class
action,
certification
was
denied.
as
i
said,
over
seven
months
went
by
before
the
case
was
finally
terminated
and
no
one
made
any
effort
to
join
or
intervene
or
enter
the
suit
in
any
fashion
and
that
leads
me
to
--
to
say
that
this
court
has
previously
dealt
in
effect
with
two
situations;
one,
an
appeal
for
a
certified
anonymous
class
despite
a
mooted
plaintiff
and
where
the
only
identifiable
person
showing
an
evident
continuing
interest
in
the
legal
issue
was
counsel.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
nobody
tried.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
and
not
now.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
meant
to
say
that,
i
--
i
may
not
have
said
it
clear.
no
one
has
attempted
to
intervene
at
any
point
including
up
until
today.
now,
you
have
previously
considered
the
situation
where
there
was
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
a
certified
class.
in
addition,
the
court
has
considered
the
situation
where
there
was
an
appeal
by
an
intervenor
after
denial
of
certification
and
after
a
settlement
by
the
named
"plaintiffs."
but
today,
you'll
consider
in
a
situation
where
named
plaintiffs
with
moot
claims
ask
the
appellate
court
to
reverse
the
trial
court's
denial
of
class
status
with
no
intervenors.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
oh!
i
think
that
the
cases
are
reconcilable,
your
honor.
i
think
that
sometimes
when
we
write
a
particular
opinion,
maybe
we
--
we
can't
say
it
a
little
bit
strong
for
the
particular
version
that
it's
being
put
forth
but
--
and
--
and
i'm
--
i
am
familiar
with
all
those
cases
and
that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
but
today,
you're
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
plaintiffs
with
moot
claims
are
asking
the
appellate
court
somehow
to
engage
in
legal
fiction
and
let
me
say
this,
i
--
i
think
this
is
the
heart
of
the
lawsuit.
an
exercise
in
the
legal
fiction
is
unquestionably
required
to
reverse
on
appeal
and
make
the
reversal,
if
your
honors
please,
retroactive
back-past
the
mootness
occurrence
until
the
time
that
the
appellate
court
says
the
district
court
should've
certified
the
case.
now,
that
takes
an
exercise
in
legal
fiction.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
article
iii
permits
engaging
in
such
a
legal
fiction
or
perhaps
better
put,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
such
a
legal
fiction
should
be
employed
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
that's
the
reason
i
tried
to
say
with
difference
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
an
exercise
in
legal
fiction.
and
if
i
can
--
if
i
can
say
so,
that's
what
the
court
did
in
mcdonald,
but
the
court
did
it
because
it
had
a
party
before
the
court
who
possessed
a
live
controversy
in
person
of
an
intervenor.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
mcdonald
of
--
of
course
troubles
me
and
i
wouldn't
be
candid
if
i
--
if
i
didn't
say
that
it
did.
there's
one
sentence
in
mcdonald
that
of
course
my
friend
seized
upon
and
i
wish
it
wasn't
there,
but
that
sentence
was
not
necessary
for
the
decision.
that
sentence
was
not
essential
for
the
decision
as
i
read
the
decision
united
conceded
it
that
particular
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
--
as
i
recall
the
dissent,
they
were
also
dealing
in
other
factors.
my
point
is
this,
what
the
court
has
done,
right
or
wrong,
so
far,
the
court
has
said,
"well,
we
can
permit
an
appeal
by
certified
class
because
it
--
it
acquires
a
separate
and
distinct
legal
status"
and
we've
not
only
said
that,
we've
said
that's
significant
and
so
we
can
permit
a
certified
class
to
appeal.
then
we
come
along
in
mcdonald
and
we
say,
we
can
take
this
a
step
further
and
we
can
permit
an
intervenor
to
appeal
where
we
do
not
have
a
certified
class.
now,
if
we're
now
going
to
say
that
anytime
a
lawyer
files
a
suit
and
entitles
it
a
class
action,
does
not
persuade
the
court
that
case
should
be
certified,
the
case
becomes
moot
that
counsel
at
his
own
instance
and
on
his
own
behalf
can
continue
to
pursue
the
litigation
as
long
as
he
chooses.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes.
he
was
simply
saying
as
i
recall
your
honor
that
judge
rubin
went
further
than
he
--
than
he
had
to
go.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
but
i
see
no
--
no
distinction.
in
october,
1975,
this
case
was
stripped
of
its
class
action
characteristics.
it
had
none.
now,
the
bank
was
in
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
certification.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
certainly
unless
in
the
interim
his
claim
becomes
moot.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
unless
in
the
interim,
his
claim
becomes
moot.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
in
our
judgment,
he
does.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
motivation
of
a
named
plaintiff
is
to
recover
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
have
said
that
--
that
he
does
as
long
as
he
himself
possesses
a
live
claim
but
not
--
not
that
--
not
in
immortality.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
--
well,
let's
talk
about
that
a
minute
because
that's
one
of
the
key
things
here.
the
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
the
--
there's
also
talk
of
settlement
in
the
opinion
and
that's
incorrect.
here's
--
here's
what
happened
and
the
record
shows
it.
seven
months
after
the
denial
of
class
certification,
the
bank
said
to
the
two
plaintiffs,
"what
are
you
claiming?"
they
responded,
"the
bank
tendered
to
them
every
dollar
they
were
claiming."
now,
it's
inferred
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there's
something
wrong
about
that.
what
did
the
bank
do?
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
they
did.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
to
--
to
get
right
down
at
the
lawsuit,
judge,
there's
no
way
that
rule
23,
a
rule
of
procedure,
can
somehow
create
appellate
jurisdiction
or
power
to
decide
a
moot
question.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it
became
moot
when
there
was
nobody
left
in
a
lawsuit
contending
that
the
question
still
existed
with
counsel.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
there's
nobody
before
the
court
was
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
because
the
--
the
controversy
is
moot.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it
became
moot
--
your
honor
as
i've
said,
the
minute
their
personal
claims
become
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
we
could
have
but
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
not
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
the
court.
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
the
court,
you've
got
to
give
the
trial
court
a
fair
chance
and
a
fair
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
certification
question.
you
can't
just
run
in
and
--
and
moot
the
case
immediately.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
that's
--
that's
a
candid
look
at
it,
your
honor
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
and
i
--
i
realize
that
--
that
i'm
not
satisfying
your
inquiries
over
here
and
the
reason
is
that
i
think
you're
assuming
with
those
questions
that
the
--
if
--
that
when
you
filed
a
lawsuit,
that
somehow
the
rule
when
it
permits
you
to
request
class
action
status,
permits
you
to
litigate
that
question
all
the
way
up,
but
here's
the
problem.
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
i
don't
think
it
ever
should've
gotten
to
the
question
but
it
did
and
it
said
that
the
district
judge
was
wrong
when
he
denied
certification.
now,
what
the
district
judge
did
was
not
void.
it
was
simply
wrong
according
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
enter
a
--
a
nunc
pro
tunc
type
ruling
and
--
and
have
that
jump
back
in
time
to
the
time
when
the
district
judge
entered
his
ruling.
now,
i
think
the
problem
is
that
if
you
are
conscientious
appellate
judge
and
you
have
something
before
you
and
you
think
it
was
decided
wrong
below,
you
know,
you
feel
like
you
need
to
decide
it
and
correct
it,
but
there
are
many
instances
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
i
could
--
i
think
i
could
make
a
strong
argument
that
it
would.
but
you
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
but
--
but,
as
i
understand
the
--
the
rulings,
you've
made
the
--
made
the
important
distinction
between
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--
the
time
of
certification.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
don't
know.
one
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
put
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
personal
stake
here,
your
honor
is
money
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--
is
money.
and
if
these
named
plaintiffs
recover
their
money,
they
have
recovered
their
entire
stake.
now,
what's
happened
in
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
perhaps
in
other
places
around
the
country,
this
is
exactly
what's
happened.
first,
they
came
along
with
title
7
cases,
let's
say,
and
the
named
plaintiff
controversy
would
become
moot.
but
the
court
would
say,
"because
it's
this
type
of
case
and
because
congress
has
entrusted
the
federal
courts
with
particular
responsibility
in
this
kind
of
case,
sort
of
a
private
attorney
general
concept
that
the
nexus
is
there
and
we
will
continue
with
--
with
the
lawsuit,
with
legal
fiction
perhaps
justified,
perhaps
not."
they
do
that
in
a
half
of
dozen
of
cases,
your
honor
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
get
to
a
pure,
commercial
money
lawsuit
and
they
do
the
same
thing
and
cite
as
authority
these
earlier
title
seven
decisions
which
will
bottom
on
an
entirely
different
premise.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
that
would
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
would
hate
to
say
it
exactly
that
way.
that's
one
way
for
him
to
continue
it
unfortunately.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
wish
i
knew
that
one.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
realism
and
i
--
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
say
this
correctly,
the
realism
is
if
the
case
should
not
be
here
and
shouldn't
be
litigated
when
there
is
no
controversy.
there
is
not
a
single
dissatisfied
customer
out
of
90,000
of
deposit
guaranty
national
bank
other
than
two
who
claimed
money
and
has
been
tendered
to
them,
not
a
single
dissatisfied
customer.
so
i
submit
that
the
realism
of
the
matter
is
that
because
counsel
wishes
to
pursue
the
litigation,
it
can
be
pursued
so
long
as
counsel
deems
appropriate.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
they
tendered
to
the
named
plaintiffs,
was
nothing
more
than
a
deliberate
act
to
destroy
the
jurisdiction.
it
was
a
calculated
gimmick
and
they
--
they
refer
in
their
brief
to
being
weary
of
the
litigation.
i
think
electrified
of
the
possibilities
of
having
to
pay
back
the
illegal
entries
is
what
motivated
their
entire
conduct.
the
case
of
controversy
rule
that
the
--
the
basis
for
it
in
the
trial
part
of
that
government,
it
makes
sense
that
the
judicial
power
not
be
exercised
except
in
real
cases
and
not
in
imaginary
cases.
it
is
also
a
device
for
ensuring
the
quality
of
an
adversary
proceeding
in
this
form
that
we
have
historically
come
at
custom
the
resolution
of
judicial
controversies.
i
submit
we
have
that
here.
there
are
cases
where
both
parties
said,
"please
rule,
we've
got
to
have
an
answer
to
this,"
and
the
--
this
court
has
said,
"oh
no,
just
because
both
parties
want
and
ask
that
doesn't
mean
this
court
is
going
to
have
a
case
of
controversy
jurisdiction."
those
cases
aren't
important
here.
we've
got
one
party
that
doesn't
want
any
ruling.
we've
got
one
that
says,
"this
isn't
live
and
active
controversy,"
and
that's
the
plaintiffs.
now,
mootness
is
a
time
dimension
of
standing.
there
is
no
question
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
action,
the
named
plaintiffs
had
standing
and
they
possessed
all
of
the
prerequisites
of
rule
23.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
alright
sir.
the
notice
of
appeal
is
a
strange
thing
in
this
case.
the
appeal
was
not
filed
for
the
named
plaintiffs
but
was
filed
for
--
solely
on
behalf
of
an
anonymous
unnamed,
uncertified
class.
reference
has
been
made
to
illegal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
bank.
now,
the
record
before
you
shows
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
mississippi
has
not
only
specifically
outlined
the
charges
that
can
be
made
for
credit
card
arrangements,
such
as
this
but
has
made
that
retroactive.
so,
you
could
say
to
me
what
are
you
concerned
about,
not
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
the
court
please,
but
concerned
about
with
no
champion
and
we
say
no
jurisdiction
concerned
about
notices,
about
a
dispute
that
started
in
1971
being
sent
by
a

that's
what
the
bank
is
concerned
about.
and
we
submit
that
in
a
case
of
no
jurisdiction,
that
shouldn't
take
place
when
here
comes
a
notice
from
a
court
which
of
course
a
great
many
of
them
will
not
understand,
suggesting
that
they
opt
in
or
opt
out
as
the
case
maybe
of
litigation
of
this
type.
now,
counsel
says
that
if
certification
is
significance
that
this
puts
the
trial
judge
in
--
in
a
position
of
--
of
power
that

i
submit
that
certification
does
require
integrity
at
the
trial
level,
the
question
of
certification
and
i
submit
that
so
does
the
entire
judicial

require
integrity
at
the

level.
how

our

upon

at

whether
we
sometimes
like
it

not

article

dictates
that
the

judge
many
times
rule
upon
questions
that
are

after
