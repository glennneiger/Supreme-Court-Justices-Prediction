mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
charges
made
during
the
briefing
and
to
some
extent
during
argument
that
this
is
an
action
maintained
for
the
benefit
of
the
attorneys.
i
don't
mean
to
take
unto
umbrage
but
i
do
detect
some
suggestion
of
lack
of
unprofession
--
of
lack
of
professional
conduct.
there's
been
no
evidence
whatsoever.
i'm
confident
that
if
there
had
been
any
evidence
of
it,
the
defendant
would
have
been
able
to
produce
it.
that
is,
we
submit
a
smoke
screen.
this
is
not
purely
a
commercial
damage
action.
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
charge
of
usury
by
national
bank
and
in
--
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
in
direct
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
usury
usually
has
been
universally
condemned
by
about
every
culture
that
our
civilization
has
produced.
this
is
not
a
technical
usury
claim
of
one
half
of
point
or
so
forth.
this
is
a
charge
of
10%
over
the
legal
rate
of
interest.
it
involves
claims
that
will
range
from
$100
and
on
up.
that
maybe
a
small
sum
of
money
to
the
bank
but
it
aggregates
to
the
extraction
of
$12
million
in
illegal
interest
from
a
class
composed
of
upwards
of
90,000
people
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
in
that
posture,
the
public
interest
is
involved
and
this
is
an
action
charging
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
essential
to
my
theory
of
the
harmonizing
of
all
of
these
cases
which
your
honor
referred
to
as
many
forests
--
many
trees
in
the
class
action
forest.
and
in
all
of
the
cases,
in
which
we
find
language
that
a
properly
certified
class
will
avoid
mootness
in
none
of
those
cases,
warrants
the
right
to
proceed
as
a
class
action
a
litigated
issue
in
the
case
as
it
is
here.
in
only
one
case,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
vacated
the
proceedings
as
moot
where
the
class
action
was
a
litigated
issue
in
the
case
and
that's
(inaudible)
against
united
states
parole.
but
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
said,
"no,
the
district
court
was
right
there
shouldn't
be
a
class,"
it's
different
from
the
case
here.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
in
fact,
what
happened
when
the
court
denied
class
action
certification
in
a
coopers
&
lybrand
proceeding,
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
sought
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
defendants
successfully
opposed
it.
in
the
seven
months
hiatus
period
that
has
been
talking
about
was
consumed
during
that
proceeding.
then
the
plaintiffs
came
back
and
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
their
individual
claim
and
at
that
time,
the
tender
was
made
which
was
filed
with
the
court
in
the
form
of
a
confession
of
judgment.
we
served
a
counter
offer
of
judgment
which
would've
expressly
made
the
defendants
agree
that
the
class
issue
is
available
for
review.
they
wouldn't
have
anything
of
it
and
the
district
court
entered
the
judgment
over
our
objection
and
the
money
remains
in
the
court
as
of
this
date.
now,
the
thing
we
can't
lose
sight
of
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
this
was
a
classic
case
for
class
action
treatment
and
there
had
been
indeed
an
abuse
of
discretion.
in
that
portion
of
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that
before
us
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
no.
that's
right.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
trouble
because
of
the
--
the
sosna
line
of
cases
recognizes
that
this
court
has
already
embraced
the
notion
that
standing
can
exist
at
the
commencement
of
an
action.
events
can
occur
prior
to
certification
which
would
moot
the
individual
claim
but
nonetheless
case
of
controversy
jurisdiction
is
ongoing.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
both
are
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
review
standard
in
the
mootness
field
in
the
concept
of
voluntary
cessation
of
illegal
conduct
is
not
being
basis
for
mootness,
arose
historically
in
the
injunctive
context.
this
is
an
action
for
money
damages
but
i
submit
that
both
doctrines
have
a
field
of
operation
here.
the
voluntary
cessation
of
illegal
conduct
is
already
analog
to
paying
two
out
of
90,000
claims.
therefore,
that
act
ought
not
to
be
viewed
as
it
existed
for
the
purpose
of
mootness.
they've
argued
in
their
brief
that
is
not
what
the
cause
of
mootness
but
the
fact
of
it.
that
very
rule,
the
voluntary
cessation
of
legal
conduct
flies
in
the
face
of
that.
secondly,
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review;
we
all
recall
the
icc
case
where
there
was
a
raid
order
that
was
going
to
expire
and
it
did
expire
and
they
said,
"no,
capable
of
repetition
evading
review
go
forward."
the
ready
analog
to
that
and
the
money
judgment
case
is
in
this
case,
there
will
be
an
evasion
of
review
because
if
the
case
is
moot,
the
bar
of
statute
of
limitations
comes
crashing
down
on
the
entire
class.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
in
united
airlines
against
mcdonald
that
the
named
plaintiff
can
appeal.
and
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
could
have
intervened?
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
he
could've
intervened
for
himself
only
and
under
the
teaching
of
united,
i
would
assume
he
could
intervene
to
appeal
the
class
certification
issue.
this
appeal
was
noticed
before
united
was
written
where
the
right
of
intervenor
to
come
in
prospect
--
prosecute
the
appeal
was
not
as
clearly
established.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that's
right.
he
would've
been
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
of
course,
in
united,
there
was
condemnation
of
setting
up
the
multiplicity
of
action
whereby
the
named
--
the
--
the
non-member
class
comes
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
in
and
intervenes
as
a
spectator
to
a
final
judgment.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
in
united,
that's
correct.
but
the
statute
of
limitations
arguments
we're
all
made
were
non
--
were
unavailable,
unavailing
in
a
context
where
the
--
the
named
plaintiff
himself
could
have
appealed.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that,
i
think
that
that's
the
point
because
they
had
rejected
that
kind
of
offer
of
judgment
and
it
would've
just
been
a
pick
off
system,
one
right
after
another.
i
mean
there's
a
strong
argument
that
they
were
estopped
and
it
belonged
in
the
absence
of
intervenors
because
the
clear
implication
of
it
is,
"oh,
if
we'd
only
had
an
intervenor,
we
would
have
a
right
controversy
to
review
the
class
wide
issue
on
when
in
truth
and
in
fact,
they
would
have
paid
him
off
one
at
a
time"
and
i
further
submit
that
too
many
of
them
that
showed
up
that
it
turned
me
over
to
grievance
committee.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
its
--
it's
a
pick
off
anyway
you
slice
it
whether
it
occurs
before
certification
or
after
and
it's
a
calculated
gimmick
to
avoid
rule
23
treatment.
if
it
was
so
easy,
some
lawyers
in
a
big
case
that
went
through
this
court
on
big
occasions,
missed
the
boat
because
in
(inaudible),
they
could
have
tendered
a
$1.10
and
get
rid
of
the
whole
case
if
this
result
is
valid.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
no,
sir
because
you've
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
got
to
have
standing
at
the
commencement
of
the
action.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
not
the
class
claim
because
the
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
the
class
claim
is
a
properly
certifiable
class
claim
and
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
once
you
have
standing
going
in
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that's
right.
even
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled
that
the
pre-certification
payoff
won't
cut
it.
that's
susman
against
lincoln
american
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
if
it's
a
properly
certifiable
class,
that's
correct,
sir
and
that
harmonizes
with
sosna
in
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
you
wouldn't
have
the
standing
of
bringing
new
action
because
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
you
can
(inaudible)
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
can
be
ongoing
proceeding.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
the
--
in
this
case,
the
rules
of
mootness
of
this
court
have
been
--
there
must
be
a
mootness
on
all
claims,
that's
powell
against
mccormick.
part
of
the
claim
remains
unsatisfied.
80
or
two
out
of
90,000
are
the
only
claims
that
have
been
satisfied.
the
mootness
rules
of
this
court
have
said
there
must
be
the
complete
ratifications
of
the
effects
of
illegal
conduct.
that
has
been
no
such
complete
ratification.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
jacobs,
the
question
of
certification
was
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
--
at
--
in
--
in
this
proceeding.
the
--
the
litigation
of
whether
or
not
there
should've
been
a
certification
never
came
up.
the
sosna
case
is
harmony
--
is
--
is
in
harmony
with
this.
the
sosna
case
said
that
the
fact
of
the
certified
class
maybe
a
sufficient
basis
to
avoid
a
finding
of
mootness.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
certifiability
of
the
class
is
also
a
basis
for
the
avoidance
of
mootness
and
that
the
sosna
case
isn't
consistent
--
in
--
inconsistent
with
that
because
nobody
litigated
in
sosna.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
you
have
to
ask
for
certification
and
you've
have
to
have
it
refused
and
you
have
to
keep
litigating
it,
which
we
did.
now,
the
footnote
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that
would
be
a
solution
to
the
problem
and
would
avoid
the
dilemma
that
no
--
no
review
of
certification
creates,
but
if
there
can
be
no
immediate
review
of
certification
as
we
understand
the
law
to
be
today,
then
--
unless,
there
is
review
after
judgment,
then
you're
down
the
dead
end
street
of
no
review
and
you
have
to
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
the
district
court's
discretion
on
the
denial
of
class
action
is
infallible.
and
i
frankly
find
that
abhorrent
to
the
system
of
the
justice
that
i've
come
to
expect
with
the
right
to
review
of
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
on
all
your
claims.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
case
of
controversy.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
the
court
has
said
this
that
there
is
no
absence
of
case
of
controversy
when
a
named
plaintiff's
claim
becomes
moot
before
certification
can
take
place.
and
that
the
doctrine
of
relation
back
where
the
issue
will
otherwise
evade
review
is
available.
now,
they
say
there's
a
fiction
involved
here.
i
submit
if
there'll
be
a
fiction,
the
greater
fiction
is
to
say
that
the
case
of
controversy
has
gone
and
there
is
no
mootness
simply
because
two
out
of
90,000
claims
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
footnote
11
in
sosna.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
your
honor,
it
does
speak
in
the
context
of
a
transitory
temporal
type
claim.
we
respectfully
submit
the
doctrine
is
equally
applicable
here
where
the
transitory
appeal
time
has
got
to
run
before
you
can
get
up
and
then
you
get
your
review
and
then
you
ought
to
relate
back
to
the
day
you
were
in
district
court
asking
for
certification.
the
defendant's
never
challenged
the
standing
at
that
time.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
requires
any
expansion
of
any
existing
precedent.
i
think
it's
just
a
situation
of
new
wine
in
old
bottles.
it's
just
that
these
are
new
facts
which
have
never
clearly
been
opened
and
i
--
i
submit
that
it's
just
an
--
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
method
by
which
we
administer
justice
that
that
relationship
back
principle
applies
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
because
there
is
no
way
to
go
an
appeal
and
go
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
get
it
reversed
just
like
that.
and
even
that
mr.
chief
justice's
suggestion
of
opening
up
for
30
days
to
take
your
appeal,
you're
still
going
to
consume
many
months
probably
before
you
could
get
a
ruling
if
it
were
reviewed
for
that
at
that
time.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
this
court
has
not,
the
seventh
circuit
has.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
--
that
--
that's
correct
because
of
the
existence
of
a
properly
certifiable
class.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
if
he
refuses
the
tender?
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
he's
interested
in
his
own
claim
to
the
extent
that
he
doesn't
want
to
do
anything
to
jeopardize
the
other
prong
of
his
being
there
and
that's
the
fiduciary
duty
to
the
class.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
because
--
well,
one
distinction
is
when
the
payoff
after
the
lawsuit
is
filed,
that
is
the
voluntary
--
voluntary
cessation
of
illegal
conduct
which
is
calculated
to
eviscerate
rule
23
what
this
court
ought
not
tolerate.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
and
--
and
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
to
avoid
the
fact
that
there's
a
good
class
action
here,
that's
what
they
did
it
for.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
not
when
it's
a
partial
payment.
it's
not
a
complete
ratification
of
the
effects
of
the
illegal
conduct
which
is
also
an
essential
ingredient
of
mootness
that
the
illegal
conduct
be
completely
covered
up
and
everything
be
taken
care
off
and
resolved
and
made
hold.
they
say
they
were
just
paying
their
piece,
they
tendered
a
crumb.
they're
not
even
half
a
loaf.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
by
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
permitting
his
name
to
be
used
in
the
u.s.
district
courthouse
on
a
complaint
where
the
claim
asked
them
for
a
class
action
treatment.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that's
a
commitment
to
that
class.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
that
--
that
is
very
correct.
we're
here
whether
we
answered
the
call
of
(voice
overlap)
his
right.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
that
in
the
abstract
if
the
court
is
interested
but
for
the
purposes
of
resolving
this
case,
that
question
is
not
going
to
affect
the
result.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
class
action
rule
could
procedurally
--
a
rule
of
procedure
could
dictate
what
and
what
isn't
substantive
fiduciary
duty,
but
i
think
that
once
you
cast
yourself
in
that
role
that
just
under
the
general
rules
that
apply
to
fiduciaries,
you
got
certain
responsibilities.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
absolutely
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
i
contend
it
that
there
was
a
right
but
not
a
duty.
that
the
duty
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
--
and
(voice
overlap)
to
have
a
ruling
on
a
procedure
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
i
come
forward
and
i
say,
"i
want
to
represent
myself
and
everybody
else,"
and
i
avail
myself
with
a
federal
procedural
rule
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
if
it
takes
to
payoff
before
certification,
he
is
liable
to
get
into
pack
of
trouble.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
they
didn't
accept
money,
your
honor.
that
money
is
still
on
deposit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
if
this
act
of
certification
has
been
refused.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
before,
i
think
it's
a
real
problem
because
you
could
extract
a
greater
claim
in
your
own
individual
behalf
and
it's
really
worth
in
order
to
avoid
the
--
the
threat
to
the
defendant
of
the
class
recovery.
and
then
you're
making
a
personal
gain
by
reason
of
somebody
else
as
being
involved
that
after
certification,
it
would
be
my
view
that
the
duty
ought
to
be
on
the
member
of
the
class
to
ascertain
the
intention
of
the
plaintiff
as
to
whether
he
was
going
to
appeal.
that's
clearly
recognized
that
he's
got
the
right
to
appeal
in
coopers
&
lybrand
running
in
united
airlines.
and
if
the
named
plaintiff
decides
that
the
--
he's
--
he's
not
going
to
appeal,
then
you
could
have
the
intervention.
our
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
on
the
25th
day.
we've
never
had
an
end
of
--
evidentiary
hearing
of
what
the
90,000
people
are
thinking
or
did
think.
we
don't
--
we'd
like
--
be
interested
to
know
on
how
many
of
them
opt
out
if
we
get
back
and
go
to
a
judgment.
but
the
fact
if
it
is,
there
was
a
five-day
period
after
we
filed
our
notice
of
appeal
when
--
for
ought
appearing
would
be
intervene
or
sat
back
and
say,
"our
rights
are
being
protected,
the
case
is
going
forward,
we're
going
to
have
judgment
next
into
erroneous
order,
reviewed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
feel
confident
that
it
will
be
overturned,"
particularly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
had
already
been
the
same
type
of
case
go
all
the
way
through
the
alabama
federal
court
system
through
certification
and
then
settlement.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
no,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
communication
that
--
that
the
bank
has
made
available
to
them
over
the
years
if
they
would
have
inquired
the
bank
as
to
what
is
going
on
in
this
lawsuit.
in
--
in
summary,
the
defendant
has
a
huge
windfall.
the
ratification
of
this
theory
of
mootness
will
allow
them
to
keep
their
windfall
after
paying
only
two
out
of
90,000
claims.
this
would
eviscerate
rule
23.
it
would
violate
the
rule
1
mandate
for
the
just
determination
of
every
action.
it
allow
--
elevates
the
district
court's
ruling
on
certification
to
a
level
of
infallibility
which
destroys
rights.
it
destroys
the
federally
created
right
to
review
and
adverse
procedural
ruling
and
it
allows
the
adverse
procedural
ruling
to
control
this
court's
subject
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
it
was
without
prejudice.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
of
course
they
paid
here
to
get
away
the
class
action
too
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
they
did
not
admit
liability,
yes.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
absolutely
and
had
the
merits
here.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
but
we
have
not
had
them
trial
on
the
merits.
in
summary,
there
is
a
logical
nexus
between
the
named
plaintiffs
and
the
class.
this
court
has
the
requisite
concreteness
and
adversity
sufficient
to
recognize
case
of
controversy
jurisdiction.
they
had
standing
going
in.
this
court
has
already
embraced
in
sosna,
the
notion
that
something
might
happen
to
that
standing
as
it
stood
on
the
day
the
plaintiff
walked
into
the
courthouse
and
then
certification
occurs
subsequently
without
destruction
of
case
of
controversy
jurisdiction.
that
rule
needs
to
be
logically
applied
in
this
case
so
as
to
recognize
the
right
of
a
named
plaintiff
who
has
been
the
victim
of
an
erroneous
ruling
on
the
right
to
certify
the
class
to
have
it
reviewed.
the
proper
test
should
be
as
to
whether
a
case
of
controversy
jurisdiction
exists,
is
--
does
the
named
plaintiff
represent
a
properly
certifiable
class
and
that
properly
certifiable
class
is
a
question
he
is
entitled
to
have
an
answer
in
the
federal
judicial
system
and
it
ought
not
to
stop
it
at
district
court
level.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
due
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
i
--
we
contended
all
along,
your
honor,
that
the
dismissal
of
the
case
after
we
had
claimed
for
class
action
treatment
ought
not
to
take
in
place.
but,
since
the
district
court
had
ruled
against
us
on
our
right
to
class
action,
then
i
would
suppose
the
district
court
will
have
the
right
to
say,
"case
dismissed,"
for
whatever
reason.
no
more
claims
live
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
but
then
we
took
it
--
we
didn't
get
in
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
the
named
plaintiffs'
claim
was
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
district
court.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
the
case
was
dismissed
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
well,
the
certification
had
been
refused
and
then
the
money
was
paid
into
the
court
and
based
upon
the
tender
--
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
--
the
judgment
was
entered,
dismissing
a
--
remain
--
the
remaining
portion
of
the
case.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
we
appealed
the
right
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
class.
mr.
champ
lyons,
jr.
yes,
we
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
of
the
entire
action
and
took
it
to
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
i'm
not
sure
where
--
where
that
leaves
me
but
that's
what
we've
all
along
sought
to
review
the
right
to
proceed
on
the
part
of
the
class
and
we
consider
that
problem
before
the
court.
thank
you.
