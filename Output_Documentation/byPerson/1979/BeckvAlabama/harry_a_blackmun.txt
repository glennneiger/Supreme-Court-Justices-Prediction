but
it
is
up
to
the
judge
to
conduct
a
separate
sentencing
hearing,
i
take
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
judge
determines
the
penalty.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
any
one
juror
can
refuse
to
vote
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
it
will
just
be
a
new
trial.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
all
12
of
them
do
not
want
to
fix
the
penalty
at
death,
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
that
was
with
respect
to
the
penalty.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

know
you
do.
i
know
you
do,
but
none
of
our
cases
say
that.
