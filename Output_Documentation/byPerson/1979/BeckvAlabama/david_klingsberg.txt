mr.
david
klingsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
upheld
a
death
sentence
based
on
a
conviction
for
the
crime
of
robbery
where
the
victim
was
intentionally
killed.
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
the
narrow
question
of
whether
a
sentence
of
death
constitutionally
may
be
imposed
after
a
jury
verdict
of
guilt
of
a
capital
offense
where
a
jury
was
not
permitted
to
consider
a
verdict
of
guilt
of
a
lesser
included
non-capital
offense
and
when
the
evidence
would
have
supported
such
a
verdict.
as
to
the
second
condition
in
your
honors'
grant
of
certiorari,
the
state
has
conceded
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction
of
a
lesser
included
offense
either
of
robbery
or
felony
murder,
both
of
which
are
non-capital
offenses
in
alabama.
the
evidence
supporting
the
lesser
offense,
briefly
stated,
is
as
follows.
petitioner
confessed
that
he
and
another
man
named
roy
clements
participated
in
a
robbery
in
which
the
victim
was
killed.
petitioner,
however,
took
the
stand
on
his
own
behalf
and
testified
that
he
did
not
do
the
killing,
that
mr.
clements
did
the
killing,
that
when
mr.
clements
did
do
the
killing,
petitioner
immediately
protested,
"oh,
my
god,
what
did
you
do?"
at
which
point
he
left
the
premises.
he
denied
having
any
weapon.
he
denied
intending
to
kill.
he
said
that
even
though
there
was
a
discussion
prior
to
the
robbery,
tying
up
the
victim,
there
was
no
discussion
or
intention
of
harming
or
killing
the
victim.
the
principal
evidence
against
the
petitioner
was
the
testimony
of
the
woman
who
was
described
by
petitioner
as
an
accomplice
and
a
lookout,
which
she
denied.
she
testified
that
petitioner
had
been
sharpening
a
knife
before
the
robbery.
that
was
also
denied
by
petitioner
and
contradicted
by
other
evidence.
the
trial
judge,
following
the
dictates
of
the
statute
in
alabama,
did
not
charge
the
jury
that
it
could
find
petitioner
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
moreover,
the
trial
judge
told
the
jury
that
if
it
acquitted
the
defendant,
he
could
never
be
tried
for
anything
that
he
did
to
the
victim.
the
alabama
circuit
court,
intermediate
court,
said
that
this
instruction
was
in
accordance
with
the
alabama
statute.
we
contend
principally
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
--
which,
incidentally,
was
not
originally
in
the
record,
but
we
had
it
sent
up,
a
certified
copy
--
said
that
the
statute
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
that
it
violates
provisions
in
the
constitution
under
the
eighth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
is
in
fact
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
the
arguments
which
had
been
made
below
in
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
on
similar
grounds,
indicating
that
the
procedure
was
akin
to
or
in
the
nature
of
a
mandatory
death
sentence,
specifically
referred
to
the
choice
which
the
jury
was
given
of
either,
one
extreme,
acquitting
the
defendant
or,
the
other
extreme,
convicting
of
the
capital
offense.
it
is
true
that
unfortunately
even
though
extensive
arguments
were
made
in
the
circuit
court
directly
on
the
point
of
the
lesser
included
offense,
that
that
was
although
in
the
petition,
not
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
affirm
on
the
basis
of
its
decision
in
the
jacobs
case,
which
dealt
only
with
federal
constitutional
issues,
dealt
at
length
with
the
lesser
included
offense
issue,
and
there
were
two
dissents
which
also
incorporated
and
referred
directly
to
their
decisions
in
jacobs
which
dealt
practically
entirely
with
this
lesser
offense
question.
so,
i
think
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
this
was
considered
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
and
the
question
has
been
preserved.
moreover,
the
state
does
not
challenge
that,
at
least
on
the
due
process
question,
only
on
the
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
petitioner
testified
that
they
did
have
an
intention
to
tie
up
the
victim
and
that
he
in
fact
had
grabbed
the
victim
from
behind
in
order
to
tie
him
up
and
that
at
that
point
mr.
clements
suddenly
and
to
the
petitioner's
surprise
attacked
him
with
a
knife.
mr.
david
klingsberg
no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
such
testimony.
the
critical
point
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
legal
issue
presented
here
i
think
is
that
there
was
a
very
sharp
issue,
very
hotly
contested
issue
on
the
question
of
intent
to
kill.
this
made
it
particularly
important
that
the
lesser-included-offense
verdict
be
given
to
the
jury
as
an
option
because
the
jury
without
it
was
placed
in
an
impossible
position.
the
jury
was
faced,
on
the
one
hand,
with
the
possibility
of
convicting
of
a
capital
offense,
and
the
only
alternative
was
acquittal
of
a
defendant
who
was
admittedly
and
confessed
to
a
very
serious
crime.
and
we
say
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
jury
would
plainly
have
veered
away
from
acquittal
in
its
deliberations,
particularly
when
attempting
to
resolve
this
delicate
issue
of
intent
to
kill.
if
the
jury's
thoughts
drifted
toward
the
possibility
of
no
intent,
finding
of
no
intent,
then
they
would
have
to
think,
"well,
we
have
to
acquit
this
defendant."
and
the
idea
of
acquitting
a
defendant
who
was
guilty
of
a
very
serious
crime,
guilty
of
a
crime
of
robbery
in
which
a
victim
was
killed,
would
be
so
repulsive
to
the
jury
that
that
would
upset
and
off
course
the
accuracy
of
their
finding
on
the
issue
of
intent
to
kill.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that
because
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
explicitly
refers
to
the
eighth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
i
disagree
with
it
because
i
think
the
court
actually
considered
that
in
light
of
its
reference
and
incorporation
of
the
jacobs
case.
i
should
also
note
that
there
was
a
rule
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
was
enacted
before
the
appeal
but
became
effective
before
the
appeal
was
decided,
which
enabled
the
supreme
court
to
consider
any
important
issues
in
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
there
is
no
question,
your
honor
--
and
the
question
is
not
raised
by
respondent
--
that
this
matter
was
raised
very
distinctly
at
the
trial
court
level.
and
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
as
contrary
to
rights
under
the
constitution.
there
were
citations
to
gregg
and
woodson.
and
there
was
specifically
in
the
argument
at
various
points
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
jury
only
has
this
choice
of
two
things,
of
convicting
of
the
capital
offense
and
imposing
the
death
sentence
or
acquittal.
it
was
raised
on
the
motion
to
quash.
it
was
raised
at
transcript
527
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
case.
and
there
was
an
exception
to
the
charge
also
referring
to
lesser
included
offenses
at
transcript
748.
so,
i
think
the
matter
was
definitely
raised
in
the
district
court.
there
was
no
point
in
requesting
the
charge
because
the
statute
explicitly
precluded
it.
but
it
was
raised
in
the
motion
to
quash.
mr.
david
klingsberg
we
contend
that
there
had
to
be
some
evidence,
and
the
state
concedes
that
there
was
some
evidence.
and
i
have
described
that
evidence,
which
was
based
principally
on
the
fact
that
petitioner
took
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf.
he
was
the
only
eye-witness.
the
testimony
against
him
was
circumstantial.
and
there
was
other
evidence
in
addition.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
on
the
intent
to
kill
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
am
speaking
simply
of
the
intent
issue.
mr.
david
klingsberg
no.
i
think
that,
for
example,
if
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand
at
all,
it
might
be
argued
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence.
but
there
is
no
question
that
when
the
petitioner
takes
the
stand
and
denies
intent
to
kill,
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
for
example,
under
the
alabama
law
which
applies
to
non-capital
cases
and
in
respect
of
the
laws
of
every
other
state
which
provides
for
lesser
included
offenses,
which
requires
that
charge
to
be
given.
mr.
david
klingsberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
and
if
they
also
believed
his
testimony
that
both
before
and
during
the
course
of
the
crime,
that
he
had
no
intent
to
harm
or
kill
the
victim.
mr.
david
klingsberg
there
were
two,
mr.
justice
marshall.
one
was
felony
murder,
which
is
not
a
capital
offense
in
alabama,
and
the
second
was
robbery.
mr.
david
klingsberg
he
can
be
acquitted
of
robbery
with
intent
to
kill,
if
the
only
basis
for
his
holding
was,
as
he
testified,
to
tie
up
the
victim
rather
than
to
cause
him
harm
or
kill
him.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
may
be.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessarily
true.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
the
order
is.
it
has
to
be
robbery
where
the
victim
is
killed
intentionally
by
the
defendant.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
absence
of
the
lesser
included-offense
instruction
and
the
appalling
prospect
which
the
jury
was
faced
with
of
acquitting
the
defendant
in
light
of
the
court's
charge,
freeing
that
defendant
and
putting
him
in
a
position
where
he
could
never
be
tried
again
for
the
crime
of
robbery
or
felony
murder
was,
we
say,
an
injection
into
this
case
of
an
extraneous
circumstance.
it
was
an
element,
a
factor,
which
created
and
influenced
the
jury
perhaps
in
a
subconscious
way,
in
a
subtle
way,
that
did
not
require
that
the
jurors
intentionally
decide
to
disobey
their
instructions.
the
jurors
who
have
a
feeling
of
duty
to
the
community,
a
natural
impulse
to
see
that
someone
pays
for
a
crime
such
as
robbery
where
a
victim
is
killed,
would
naturally
be
repulsed
by
the
prospect
of
acquitting
and
freeing
that
defendant.
and
that
factor
was
an
influence
on
the
jury's
resolution
of
the
doubts
regarding
the
intent
issue.
due
process
should
not
allow
putting
the
jury
in
a
position
where
if
it
does
not
convict
a
defendant
of
a
capital
offense,
the
results
will
be
inconsistent
with
all
of
the
human
impulses
to
do
justice.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
keable
against
united
states.
mr.
david
klingsberg
but
it
is
not
my
argument.
mr.
david
klingsberg
well
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
that
it
could
be
the
argument.
it
could
be
logically.
but
i
don't
think,
particularly
in
light
of
the
narrower
question
on
certiorari,
that
the
court
has
to
go
that
far.
the
court
has
said
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
mr.
justice
white,
that
higher
standards
of
due
process
are
required
in
capital
cases,
that
capital
defendants
should
be
accorded
all
procedural
safeguards.
this
is
a
procedural
safeguard,
and
i
think
that
the
court
could
decide
why
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
but
i
think
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
but
there
would
also
be,
because
this
is
a
capital
case
and
because
the
lesser-included-offense
crime
is
so
serious,
there
will
also
be
a
greater
abhorrence
of
letting
the
defendant
go
free
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
no,
because
in
this
case
--
and
i
think
probably
in
most
death
cases
--
the
next
lesser
offense
down
is
going
to
be
a
very
serious
offense.
and
for
that
reason
the
jury's
reluctance
to
release
and
free
this
defendant
for
all
time
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
if
your
honor
please,
there
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
there
are
two
points.
one
is
the
legal
point
that
in
a
death
case,
because
death
is
irreversible,
death
is
qualitatively
different.
there
is
no
room
for
correction.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
the
court
--
and
the
court
has
said
--
should
be
more
prone
to
apply
higher
standards
of
due
process
to
do
more
to
minimize
the
risk
of
error,
to
do
more
to
assure
that
the
jury's
resolution
of
doubt
is
a
reliable
and
accurate
resolution
of
doubt.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
other
side
and
say
that
the
jury's
reluctance
to
acquit
and
free
will
be
much
greater
where
the
lesser
included
offense
is
a
very
serious
crime,
as
it
is
here.
in
keable
against
united
states,
for
example,
where
the
court
said
that
if
a
statute
was
interpreted
--
in
that
case
the
major
crimes
act
--
was
interpreted
to
preclude
the
lesser-included-offense
instruction,
there
would
be
serious
constitutional
questions
raised
under
the
due
process
clause.
there
the
crime
charged
was
assault
with
intent
to
injure,
and
the
lesser
offense
was
simple
assault.
and
the
court,
through
mr.
justice
brennan,
held
that
it
would
go
out
of
its
way
to
avoid
interpreting
that
statute
to
preclude
lesser
offenses
even
though
the
crime
of
simple
assault
was
not
independently
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
major
crimes
act.
the
basis
for
that
decision
was
that
the
resolution
of
doubt
and
the
intent
issue,
which
as
in
this
cases
was
very
seriously
in
dispute,
would
be
affected
adversely
by
the
absence
of
the
lesser
offense.
in
this
case,
where
the
crime
is
much
more
serious
than
simple
assault,
i
think
that
the
jury's
reluctance
to
resolve
doubts
on
the
intent
issue
in
favor
of
acquittal
will
be
even
greater;
and,
therefore,
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
that
there
is
basis
in
a
capital
case
for
holding
that
lesser
offense
instructions
are
an
important
procedural
protection
which
rises
to
the
due
process
level.
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
court
avoided
the
constitutional
holding
which,
it
said,
would
have
been
presented
if
it
had
not
interpreted
the
statute
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
holding
is
not
constitutional,
and
there
has
not
been
a
constitutional
holding
because
every
state
in
the
union,
going
back
many
years--over
a
hundred
years
--
has
required
lesser
included
offenses.
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
we
can
also
look
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
is
recognized
as
a
right
of
the
defense
as
a
protection
which
the
defense
can
have
if
the
defense
wants
it
under
the
applicable
statute,
the
rules
of
procedure,
or
common
law.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
respect
of
your
earlier
question,
the
fact
that
there
have
been
many
cases,
including
cases
of
this
court
on
or
about
the
turn
of
the
century
involving
different
degrees
of
murder,
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
failure
to
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
the
lesser
included
offense
charge,
if
the
defendant
wants
it,
is
a
protection,
is
a
benefit,
is
a
procedural
right,
indicates
that
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
we
have
been
arguing
so
far,
your
honor,
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
it
is,
one,
the
accuracy
and
reliability
of
the
fact
finding.
it
has
also
been
held
by
this
court,
not
specifically
on
constitutional
grounds
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
right.
this
takes
away
from
the
province
of
the
jury
the
right
to
determine
an
important
element
of
the
case.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
it
also
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
it
also
takes
away
the
right
to
have
an
impartial
jury
because
the
jury
necessarily
becomes
biased
by
facing
this
appalling
prospect
of
releasing
a
defendant
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
no,
we
are
also
making
a
claim
in
regard
to
the
eighth
amendment
in
so
far
as
i
believe
that
we
can
look
to
the
court's
post-furman
decisions
for
guidance
on
what
should
be
the
standards,
the
standards
under
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
what
the
court
did
in
the
post-furman
decisions
in
saying
that
there
should
be
rationalization,
there
should
be
guidelines,
there
should
be
standards,
was
to
look
to
the
standards
that
have
been
generally
applied
in
the
past
at
the
guilt-finding
stage.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
standards
which
the
court
has
announced
in
those
cases
as
applicable
to
the
sentencing
stage
should
certainly
be
applied
at
the
guilt-finding
stage
as
well.
petitioner
contends
that
the
state
was
attempting
to
eliminate
all
discretion
or
as
much
discretion
as
possible,
which
it
reads,
alabama
read,
misread
i
think,
as
the
purpose
of
the
furman
decision.
and
that
i
think
is
a
quirk
--
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
separate
sentencing
in
alabama.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
the
very
same
standards
which
this
court
has
applied,
rationalizing,
providing
guidelines,
focusing
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
offense,
can
all
be
applied
to
the
lesser-offense
instruction
and
be
incorporated
into
the
due
process
requirements
for
the
lesser-offense
instruction.
the
lesser-offense
instruction
does
not,
as
alabama
initially
thought,
provide
for
a
discretionary
action
by
the
jury.
the
jury
is
not
asked
to
exercise
discretion
but
rather
is
instructed
to
find
the
correct
level
of
guilt
consonant
with
the
evidence.
the
evidence,
the
level
of
the
evidence
is
the
standard,
and
the
lesser-offense
instruction
is
the
guideline.
mr.
david
klingsberg
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
standards
which
the
court
has
applied
and
the
same
careful
scrutiny
which
the
court
has
applied
to
the
sentencing
stage
of
a
death-penalty
case
should,
in
the
case
of
guilt
finding,
also
be
applied.
mr.
david
klingsberg
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
david
klingsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
so-called
historical
evidence
which
the
respondent
cites
concerning
jury's
reluctance
to
convict
of
a
capital
crime,
based
on
our
reading
of
the
cases
in
respondent's
brief,
is
only
in
mandatory
capital
sentencing.
the
implication
of
the
argument
is
that
there
should
be
reduced
standards,
reduced
procedural
protections
in
capital
cases.
and
the
court
has
consistently
said
that
because
of
the
irreversibility
and
the
absence
of
any
opportunity
for
correction
of
error,
that
there
should
be
greater
standards
and
that
there
should
be
greater
procedural
protections
and
more
reliability
in
a
capital
case.
mistrial
is
not
a
substitute
for
the
lesser-included-offense
procedure.
this
postulates
a
situation
where
the
jurors
would
say
to
each
other,
"we
really
think
the
defendant
is
guilty
only
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
so,
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
go
and
tell
the
trial
judge
that
some
of
us
vote
to
convict,
some
of
us
vote
to
acquit.
then
there
will
be
a
mistrial.
and
then
maybe,
if
the
statute
does
not
require
it,
there
will
be
a
reindictment,
and
maybe
that
reindictment
will
be
for
the
lesser
offense,
and
maybe
there
will
be
a
conviction."
that
sort
of
speculation
on
such
a
tenuous
chain
of
events
cannot
be
a
substitute
protection.
so
far
as
the
interest
of
the
state,
which
i
think
is
really
vital
here
because
we
have
an
interest
of
the
defendant,
which
is
life
or
death.
we
have
this
court
saying
in
keeble
and
other
courts
saying
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
interference
with
the
resolution
of
doubts
and
fact
finding
in
the
event
that
lesser-included-offense
protection
is
not
given.
what
is
the
interest
of
the
state?
respondent
says
it
relates
to
bias,
discretion
in
sentencing.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
sentencing.
the
lesser-included-offense
procedure
has
to
do
with
guilt
finding.
and
where
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
denies
his
guilt
and
then
the
court
instructs
the
jury,
"you
are
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
event
that
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
supports
it,"
that
is
not
bias
that
is
not
discretion.
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
controlled,
guided
exercise
of
discretion,
which
is
what
is
suppose
to
happen
in
the
guilt-finding
stage.
mr.
david
klingsberg
not
as
furman
was
subsequently
interpreted
and
clarified
in
that
where
the
jury
is
given
instructions
and
told
to
act
on
the
basis
of
standards,
that
is
not
something
which
furman
condemned,
as
the
court
indicated
in
gregg
and
the
subsequent
cases.
and
it
is
a
misinterpretation
of
furman,
as
the
court
said
in
jurek
and
proffitt.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
same
thing
should
apply
at
the
guilt-finding
stage.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
example,
in
gregg,
when
he
was
talking
about
why
there
should
be
instructions
and
why
the
jury
should
be
guided
and
standardized
on
sentencing,
said
that
the
reason
for
that
is
because
that
is
what
juries
always
are
asked
to
do
at
the
guilt-finding
stage.
and
all
of
those
standards,
i
think,
are
adopted
and
imported
into
the
sentencing
stage
from
traditional
standards
which
are
applied
at
the
guilt-finding
stage.
i
think
that
the
state
has
no
interest
here.
clearly
this
is
something
which
is
a
misreading
and
a
misinterpretation
of
furman
and
therefore
should
be
set
aside.
thank
you.
