justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
trouble
with
this
lesser.
what
lesser
included
defense
did
the
state
agree
he
could
be
convicted
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
a
man
that
holds
a
victim
while
he
is
stabbed
can
be
acquitted
of
homicide?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
true
under
these
cases
the
man
could
not
have
gotten
stabbed
if
he
had
not
been
held?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
my
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
jury
know
about
the
lesser
included
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
the
lesser
offense.
how
did
the
jury
know
about
the
lesser
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
say
anything
about
the
ingredients
of
any
other
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
could
the
jury
have
found
him
guilty
of
any
lesser
offense
if
they
did
not
even
know
what
the
offense
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
not
say
they
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
could
find
it,
you
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
am
asking,
how
could
they
find
it
if
they
did
not
even
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
consider
murder
plus
robbery
as
being
a
lesser
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
lesser
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
less
than
murder?
murder
plus
robbery
is
less
than
murder?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
that
is
different
from
what
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
what
happens
if
the
jury
came
in
and
said,
"we
convict
him
of
second
degree
murder"?
