chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
first
in
beck
against
alabama.
mr.
klingsberg,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
getting
back
to
the
facts,
mr.
klingsberg,
i
correctly
or
got
the
impression
from
you
or
your
statement
of
the
facts
that
your
client
was
just
along,
just
present.
but
is
it
not
a
fact
that
he
held
the
victim
while
the
attacks
were
going
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
evidence
in
the
case
about
two
knives
being
present,
the
one
that
was
said
to
have
been
sharpened
by
beck?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
entitle
a
defendant
to
a
lesser
-
included
-
offense
charge,
do
you
contend
that
there
need
be
no
evidence
at
all
with
respect
to
some
lesser
included
offense
as
just
as
absolute
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
the
testimony
against
him
was
circumstantial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
just
also
told
us
he
admitted
presence
at
the
crime,
the
scene
of
the
crime,
and
holding
the
victim
at
the
time
the
victim
was,
as
he
says,
murdered
by
someone
else,
not
by
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
more
than
circumstantial,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point
is
that
if
they
believed
his
testimony
that
he
was
just
holding
the
man
and
that
the
other
fellow
did
the
cutting
with
the
knife,
then
he
should
be
found
guilty,
could
be
found
guilty
of
some
lesser
included
offense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
keable
case
was
not
based
on
a
constitutional
holding,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
holding
is
not
constitutional.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
the
requirement
if
the
defense
does
not
want
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
that
due
process
is
satisfied,
i
take
it,
by
the
fact
that
after
the
jury's
verdict,
the
defendant,
the
accused
has
another
shot
at
it
if
he
can
persuade
the
judge
that
the
jury
verdict
was
too
harsh
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
jury's
verdict
is
not
final,
is
it,
on
the
issue
of
life
or
death?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carnes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
under
the
alabama
system
the
jury
that
had
any
inclination
to
find
a
lesser
included
offense
or
a
lesser
consequence
would
simply
have
returned
a
verdict
as
they
did
but
with
no
recommendation
on
the
death
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
would
be
nothing
for
the
judge
to
veto.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
split?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
clarify
for
me
again,
if
the
jury
had
made
no
recommendation
of
death,
what
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
would
be
nothing
for
the
judge
to
do
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes
left,
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
