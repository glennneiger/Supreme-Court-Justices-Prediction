justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
of
course
there
are
cases
where
--
we
have
had
them
here,
and
i
have
had
more
of
them
on
the
court
of
appeals
--
where
defense
counsel
prefer
to
have
only
the
most
serious
presented
to
the
jury
and
do
away
with
lesser
included
offenses
in
the
thought
that
the
evidence
is
shaky
enough
that
a
jury
will
not
convict
of
the
most
serious
offense
where
they
might
opt
for
a
lesser
included
one.
and
you
do
not
pursue
that
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
then,
i
take
it,
this
is
an
argument
that
is
not
confined
to
death
cases.
i
mean,
this
is,
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
on
the
due
process
basis
that
it
would
lead
to
inaccurate
verdicts
in
non-death
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
it
does.
when
are
you
going
to
limit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
just
been
going
that
far
though.
that
is
your
argument
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
could
certainly
argue
that
if
it
is
a
capital
case,
the
jury
might
be
even
less
willing
to
convict
of
the
greater
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
knows
then
that
there
would
be
a
chance
of
the
death
penalty
even
though
the
jury
would
not
impose
it
itself.
there
would
even
be,
i
would
suppose,
there
would
be
less
reason
for
them
to
convict
of
the
greater
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
because
it
is
a
death
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i
do
not
see
why
it
is
any
more
telling
in
a
death
case
than
in
any
other,
and
it
might
even
be
less.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
i
know
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
therefore,
the
jury
would
be
more
reluctant
to
convict
of
the
greater
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
response
to
my
earlier
question
really
was
not
responsive.
well,
go
ahead.
in
any
event,
you
want
them
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
klingsberg,
what
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
have
you
been
arguing
about
so
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
due
process
in
general
in
terms
of
the
accuracy
of
the
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
a
deprivation
of
jury
trial,
or
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
claims
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
that
is
interference
with
the
right
to
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
well
as
just
generally
it
risks
such
inaccuracy
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
the
only
two
--
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
the
only
constitutional
claims
you
are
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
carnes,
could
i
go
back
to
a
problem
that
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
of
your
adversary
has
raised?
and
that
is
that
sometimes
it
is
advantageous
for
the
defendant
and
sometimes
disadvantageous
to
have
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
i
suppose
for
both
sides
it
kind
of
increases
the
gamble.
say
there
is
about
a
90
percent
chance
of
conviction
of
an
intermediate
offense
and
maybe
a
50/50
chance
of
conviction
of
the
greater
offense,
in
which
event
you
only
submit
the
greater
offense.
it
is
kind
of
you
are
really
rolling
the
dice
in
the
case.
what
is
the
state
interest
in
this
particular
statute
denying
the
lesser-included-offense
instruction
in
any
situation
--
because
sometimes
the
state
would
be
better
off
obviously
to
have
the
man
convicted
of
the
intermediate
offense
and
go
scott
free.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
state
interest
does
the
statute
vindicate?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
do
not
want
their
contention.
what
is
your
explanation
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
to
me
in
the
example
i
gave
you
--
how
does
that
reduce
arbitrariness
where
you
increase
the
gamble,
the
50/50
case
but
where
you
could
get
a
sure
conviction
in
the
--
i
do
not
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
one
infer
that
maybe
california
--
or,
rather,
alabama
--
thought
it
was
necessary
to
do
this
to
comply
with
furman?
but
if
they
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
it
is
hardly
a
very
reasonable
way
to
approach
the
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
alabama's
policy
in
non-death
cases
is
directly
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
rule
in
that
instruction
for
the
jury
to
split
on
the
death
penalty?
it
does
not
sound
to
me
like
there
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
jacobs
against
state
before
me.
it
says
that
under
the
alabama
scheme,
if
the
jury
refuses
to
follow
the
legislative
mandate
and
does
not
fix
the
penalty
at
death,
the
statutory
scheme
acts
as
a
form
of
safety
valve
favorable
to
the
accused
because
if
one
single
juror
refuses
to
follow
the
legislative
mandate
and
refuses
to
fix
the
penalty
at
death,
the
trial
court
may
grant
a
mistrial,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says
too.
what
does
that
"may"
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
can
the
judge
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
a
judge
do
if
they
bring
back
a
verdict
and
they
have
not
fixed
a
death
penalty
because
one
juror
will
not
agree?
does
he
say,
"go
back
and
do
your
job,"
or
what
does
he
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
jury
just
will
not
do
it,
then
he
either
acquits
them
or
has
a
mistrial.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statute
on
its
face
seems
to
contemplate
just
such
a
possibility,
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
jury
not
agreeing.
