mr.
edward
e.
carnes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
all
the
questions
about
the
facts
and
the
alabama
law
and
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
devote
approximately
five
minutes
to
that
topic
before
i
turn
to
the
merits.
the
petitioner
was
not
indicted,
tried,
and
convicted
for
the
capital
crime
of
robbery,
during
the
course
of
which
the
defendant
was
intentionally
killed.
that
is
how
the
statute
said.
but
the
state
gratuitously
averred
that
the
victim
was
murdered
in
the
first
degree
by
the
defendant.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said
when
we
aver
it,
we
have
to
prove
it.
it
is
not
a
variance
between
the
statute
and
the
indictment,
but
nonetheless
we
are
stuck,
so
to
speak,
with
what
we
say
in
the
indictment.
the
elements
of
that
crime,
as
defined
in
ritter
v.
state
--
and
that
is
the
important
case
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
on
what
the
elements
are
--
was
robbery,
which
the
defendant
admitted.
first
degree
murder
of
the
victim
during
the
robbery,
which
the
defendant
admitted
by
admitting
facts
sufficient
to
constitute
felony
murder,
first
degree
murder.
and
the
third
element,
the
crucial
element,
the
one
which
was
in
some
dispute
at
the
trial,
was
defined
in
ritter
as
related
to
the
intent
and
culpability.
ritter
said
that
even
though
the
defendant
did
not
have
to
actually
do
the
killing
himself,
he
nonetheless
--
a
non-trigger
man
or
non-knife
wielding
defendant
as
in
this
case
--
either
had
to
have
had
some
kind
of
particularized
intent
that
the
killing
take
place,
or
he
had
to
have
been
a
knowing
accomplice
to
the
intentional
killing
itself,
not
the
robbery,
but
the
intentional
killing.
ritter
went
on
to
define
"accomplice
to
the
intentional
killing
itself"
as
meaning
that
the
defendant
either
sanctioned
or
knowingly
facilitated
the
crime.
and
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
defendant
and
the
co-defendant
clements
both
admitted
they
went
there
and
both
participated
in
a
robbery.
they
both
admitted
that
when
they
left,
both
victims
were
dead.
they
of
course
disputed
who
committed
the
murder,
the
actual
stabbing
or
throat
cutting.
each
one
blamed
it
on
the
other
one
and
said,
"oh,
i
was
just
shocked,
i
was
appalled,
i
had
no
idea.
i
was
just
sick
at
heart
when
i
found
out
what
happened.
and
i
immediately
repudiated
it.
"in
other
words,
both
of
them
admitted
robbery.
both
of
them
admitted
first
degree
murder.
and
both
of
them
denied
the
third
crucial
element
in
ritter.
and
the
evidence
on
that
third
disputed
element
at
trial
was
this.
beck
admitted
that
he
was
12
years
older
than
clements.
beck
admitted
that
it
was
he
who
drove
to
and
from
the
crime.
beck
admitted
that
it
was
he
who
disposed
of
the
victims'
wallet
and
purse.
beck
also
admitted
that
he
held
the
victim
down
while
the
victim's
throat
was
being
cut.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
overwhelming.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
it
depends
on
how
you
define
the
word
"consistent."
consistent
as
a
matter
of
alabama
state
law
because
we
have
such
a
broad
lesser-included-offense
permissibility?
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
in
terms
of
the
berra
and
sansome
rational
or
reasonable
basis,
there
is
a
very
real
question.
but
what
we
concede
in
section
8
of
our
brief
is
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
preclusion
as
a
matter
of
alabama
state
law,
the
jury
would
have
been
instructed,
not
necessarily
it
would
have
been
under
berra
and
sansome
and
certainly
not
that
they
would
have
been
constitutionally
entitled
to
it.
but
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no
question
about
it.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no
question
about
it.
also
beck
admitted
that
his
clothing
was
to
blood
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
victim
that
he
had
to
burn
it.
he
admitted
that
he
had
the
victim's
blood
on
his
pants,
shirt,
jacket,
and
boots.
another
witness
whom
beck
disputed
testified
at
trial
that
beck
was
sharpening
his
knife
before
they
went
to
commit
the
crime.
a
second
witness,
whom
beck
admitted
was
telling
the
truth
about
everything
she
testified
to,
testified
that
after
they
got
back,
beck
said,
quote,
"we
did
it."
and
beck
specifically
admitted
she
told
the
truth
about
everything.
beck
himself,
even
though
he
said,
"well,
i'm
the
one
that
was
surprised.
i'm
the
one
who
was
shocked,"
he
testified
concerning
ritter's
condition
after
the
crime,
emotional
condition.
and
this
is
very
pertinent
to
who
was
surprised
and
who
was
shocked.
beck
himself
testified,
quote,
"roy
was
white
as
a
sheet,
shaking
all
over
like
a
wet
cold
bird
dog
freezing
to
death."
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
evidence
that
beck
himself
was
so
visibly
shaken.
so,
there
was
from
the
undisputed
evidence,
also
the
only
way
beck
could
have
planned
to
get
away
with
this
robbery
was
by
killing
the
victim
because
the
victim,
roy
malone,
knew
beck
on
a
name
basis,
knew
where
he
lived
and
could
identify
him.
of
course
beck
said,
"i
was
planning
on
going
to
florida.
"but
the
state
of
alabama
has
very
good
extradition
relationships
with
the
state
of
florida,
and
beck
could
not
have
imagined
in
any
way
he
could
have
evaded
such
a
serious
crime
by
merely
going
across
the
state.
so,
the
overwhelming
evidence
was
that
beck
either
committed
the
murder
himself,
had
a
particularized
intent
to
do
so,
or
knowingly
facilitated
or
sanctioned
it.
nonetheless,
as
a
matter
of
alabama
state
law,
because
beck
got
up
and
said,
"notwithstanding
all
the
evidence,
i
deny
that
i
knowingly
facilitated
it.
i
facilitated
it,
yes,
but
i
did
not
know
it,
and
i
deny
that
i
knew
that
it
was
going
to
take
place,"
alabama
law,
under
the
davis
decision
specifically
cited
in
that
case,
says
that
if
there
as
any
evidence
barring
preclusion,
statutory
preclusion,
if
there
is
any
evidence
whatever,
quote,
"however
insufficient
or
lacking
in
credibility,"
end
of
quote,
only
an
entire
absence
of
evidence
can
you
preclude
it
common
law.
and
because
of
that,
we
concede
as
a
matter
of
alabama
state
law
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
statutory
preclusion
clause,
the
instruction
would
have
been
given
enabling
the
jury
to
convict
on
those
lower
offenses.
but
now
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
determining
that
a
lesser
included
offense
occurred
and
convicting
on
the
lesser
included
offense.
the
alabama
capital
punishment
statute
does
not
preclude
the
jury
from
determining
that
the
defendant
was
only
guilty
of
a
lesser
offense.
instead,
what
the
alabama
statute
does
is
preclude
them
from
convicting
on
that
lesser
offense
and
say,
"if
you
determine
that
he
is
guilty
of
only
the
lesser
offense,
you
acquit
him
of
that
higher
capital
offense."
on
the
issues
question
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
one
would
not
know.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
your
honor,
i
was
simply
trying
to
stress
that
the
jury
was
not
permitted
--
was
not
prevented
from
considering
the
fact
that
he
may
have
just
been
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
in
other
words,
their
argument
is
in
order
to
have
fact
finding,
an
impartial
jury,
into
--
one
of
their
arguments
is
in
order
to
fit
the
facts
to
the
crime,
the
jury
ought
to
be
able
to
determine
whether
he
was
guilty
of
a
lesser
offense
or
not.
they
can
determine
that.
they
just
cannot
convict
him
of
it.
perhaps
i
can
give
more
weight
to
that
distinction
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
they
were
instructed
on
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder
and
first
degree
robbery
as
part
of
the
higher
crime,
and
they
were
told
--
they
were
also
instructed
on
intent
not
as
clearly
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
they
are
told.
these
are
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder.
these
are
the
elements
of
robbery.
unless
you
find
both
of
these
elements,
you
cannot
find
him
guilty
of
the
higher
offense.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
other
than
murder
and
robbery,
no,
sir,
except
the
intent
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
your
honor,
if
they
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
they
could
not
return
a
verdict
convicting
him.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
if
they
found
he
was
guilty
of
murder
and
of
robbery
but
not
of
the
intent
element,
then
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no
question
about
it.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
it
is
lesser
than
the
capital
offense
defined
in
ritter.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no,
sir.
murder
plus
robbery
is
less
than
a
capital
offense
in
alabama.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
ritter
is
the
--
i
apologize
for
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
intent
to
kill,
no,
sir.
the
statute
specifically
bans
felonies.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
most
--
well,
felony
murder
is
defined
as
one
of
the
four
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no
question.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes.
turning
now
to
the
issues
on
the
merits,
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
involved
in
this
case
depend
actually
on
the
answer
to
one
question,
and
that
question
is
essentially,
does
preclusion
in
the
special
context
of
the
alabama
statute
jeopardize
the
reliability
of
fact
finding
and
undermine
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
cases
tried
under
that
statute?
if
this
court
determines,
viewing
the
statute
and
its
particularities,
if
this
court
determines
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
then
the
preclusion
clause
is
unconstitutional
and
should
in
fact
be
struck
down.
however,
if
this
court
determines
that
the
answer
to
that
crucial
question
is
no,
then
just
as
clearly
and
just
as
certainly
the
preclusion
clause
should
be
upheld
and
the
statute's
validity
affirmed.
it
is
our
position
that
preclusion
does
not
undermine
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
does
not
jeopardize
the
reliability
of
fact
finding,
at
least
not
in
the
context
of
alabama's
statute,
which
has
special
procedural
safeguards,
three
of
these.
the
first
is
the
requirement
that
the
jury,
in
its
verdict
form,
fix
the
penalty
of
death
even
though
the
jury
has
no
role
in
the
sentencing
process
and
the
judge
and
not
the
jury
sentences.
the
requirement
that
the
jury
fix
the
penalty
at
death
--
and
no
defendant
can
be
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
in
alabama
unless
that
jury
verdict
form
says,
"and
we
fix
the
penalty
or
punishment
at
death"
--
is
for
the
specific
purpose
of
calling
upon
the
jury's
historical
reluctance
and
caution,
some
of
which
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
earlier,
in
capital
cases.
and
the
historical
evidence
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
17
to
21
shows
the
jurors
in
capital
cases
are
extremely
reluctant
to
convict
when
death
appears
to
be
the
result.
they
resolve
all
doubts
on
guilt
or
innocence
--
on
guilt
or
innocence
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
not
the
state.
it
is
different
from
non-capital
cases.
and
the
evidence
shows
that
if
they
do
disobey
their
instructions,
it
is
to
favor
capital
defendants
and
not
the
state.
this
court
in
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief
has
relied
upon
that
difference
in
capital
as
versus
non-capital
cases
in
decisions
in
the
past.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no,
sir.
they
might
have
done
that,
and
that
would
indicate
to
the
trial
judge
that
his
instructions
had
not
been
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
that
is
not
a
permissible
verdict
form.
if
the
jury
comes
back
with
that
form
in
alabama,
that
is
not
a
resolution
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
if
they
split,
there
is
a
mistrial.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir,
which
is
a
safeguard,
the
second
safeguard
in
our
statute,
because
the
statute
says
if
there
is
a
mistrial
either
because
of
a
failure
to
agree
on
guilt
or
innocence,
or
because
somebody
does
not
want
to
write,
"fix
the
penalty
at
death"
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
there
is
a
mistrial,
and
there
is
the
possibility
the
reindictment
option
--
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
after
a
mistrial
because
of
the
failure
of
the
jury
to
agree,
the
state
can
go
back
and
reindict
on
a
non-capital
lesser
included
offense.
and
the
jury
in
this
case
was
specifically
instructed
about
that
possibility.
and
one
of
the
defendant
beck's
two
retained
attorneys
at
trial
even
mentioned
or
alluded
to
it
in
his
oral
argument.
he
said,
"look,
do
not
be
stampeded.
do
not
be
rushed
into
this
thing.
if
i
have
any
possibility
under
a
reindictment
or
otherwise
to
take
my
man
before
the
bar
of
justice
and
plead
him
guilty
to
these
lesser
offenses
of
murder
or
robbery,
i
will
do
it.
i
will
do
it,
but
do
not
be
stampeded.
"and
then
the
judge
told
them
if
they
returned
a
failure
to
agree
on
the
penalty
of
death,
on
guilt
or
innocence,
that
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
the
reindictment.
of
course
the
state
controls
the
reindictment
option.
the
state
determines
that.
but
just
by
telling
the
jury
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
that,
the
importance
is
it
is
a
safeguard.
they
say
the
jury,
if
he
is
guilty
of
a
serious
non
--
a
lesser
included
offense
such
as
robbery
or
murder,
the
jury
may
feel
compelled
to
convict
an
innocent
man,
innocent
of
the
capital
offense,
just
to
keep
from
letting
him
go.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
the
judge
would
say,
"no,
you
do
not.
you
cannot
do
that."
he
would
either
interpret
that
as
an
acquittal,
which
there
would
be
very
strong
arguments
for,
or
declare
a
mistrial,
depending
on
whether
his
instructions
had
been
clear
or
not.
the
importance
of
the
mistrial
option
is
that
if
the
jury
does
disobey
the
instructions
--
they
say,
"okay,
the
guy
--
we've
got
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
capital
offense
but
we
do
not
want
to
let
him
go,"
it
gives
them
a
way
out.
it
is
a
safeguard,
a
stop
measure.
and
the
keeble
case
was
different.
the
dictum
or
the
reasoning
in
the
keeble
case
was
different
on
these
two
particularities.
there
was
no
verdict
form
convicting
the
man
in
setting
his
penalty
or
his
punishment
at
death.
there
was
no
calling
upon
the
traditional
reluctance
and
caution
of
jurors
in
capital
cases.
also
there
was
no
mistrial
and
reindictment
option.
of
course
the
jury
in
that
case
could
have
mistried,
as
any
jury
can.
but
they
were
not
told
that
if
the
guy
was
guilty
of
only
a
lesser
included,
he
could
be
reinducted.
and
in
distinguishing
our
case
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
exactly.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
and
as
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
interpreted,
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
a
lesser
included;
so,
there
was
no
way
up
until
keeble
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
--
under
that.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir.
in
distinguishing
the
language
of
keeble,
we
rely
heavily
upon
parker
v.
randolph
type
analysis
where
this
court
or
a
plurality
of
this
court
said,
"we
held
one
thing
in
bruton.
we
are
holding
a
different
thing
here
because
every
case
should
be
decided
upon
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
unique
to
the
procedure
in
question
there.
change
of
one
fact,
change
of
one
circumstance
may
tip
the
constitutional
scales
the
other
way."
and
that
is
what
--
even
accepting
the
reasoning
in
keeble,
which
was
not
a
constitutional
decision,
that
is
what
we
feel
distinguishes.
there
is
a
third
safeguard
built
into
the
statute
to
ensure
that
a
person
who
is
not
guilty
of
the
capital
offense
is
not
executed,
and
that
is
the
judge's
sentencing
authority.
the
separation
of
the
judge's
determination
of
sentencing
from
the
trial
jury's
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
judge
is
not
in
any
way
bound,
as
in
the
tomlin
decision
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
makes
clear,
by
any
fact
finding.
the
judge
can
find
the
facts
in
the
sentence
hearing
entirely
different
then
the
jury
did,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
in
tomlin.
but
even
if
the
judge
accepts
the
jury's
fact
finding
on
guilt,
he
can
say,
"all
right,
it
was
enough
to
convict
a
man.
but
i
am
not
going
to
sentence
a
man
to
death
because
it
just
was
not
enough
for
me.
it
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
jury."
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
trial
court
did
in
neal
v.
state.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
not
on
the
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
the
state
interest
is
the
purpose
behind
the
statute.
it
is
their
contention
that
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
our
contention
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
reduce
arbitrariness,
capriciousness,
and
discrimination
in
sentencing
even
beyond
the
amount
the
constitution
would
tolerate.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
the
underlying
judgment
is
that
if
there
is
a
50/50
gamble,
that
in
itself
is
something
of
capriciousness
or
arbitrariness.
the
alabama
statute
focuses
on
sentencing
results
in
capital
cases
and
says,
"okay,
in
gregg,
jurek,
and
proffitt
the
court
said
you
do
not
have
to
preclude.
you
can
reduce
to
the
level
the
constitution
will
tolerate
the
amount
of
arbitrariness,
discrimination,
and
capriciousness
by
other
means."
but
what
alabama
has
done
is
say,
"we
want
to
go
beyond
that.
we
want
to
reduce
it
even
further.
and
even
though
we
have
a
post-furman
and
pre-gregg
statute,
we
think
that
that
is
the
evident
purpose
behind
the
statute
because
of
the
chronology
of
some
of
the
legislative
developments."
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
one
could
certainly
infer
that,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reported
legislative
history
in
the
form
of
committee
reports
and
hearings.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
but
as
furman
posed,
capital
sentencing
is
different
from
all
other
sentencing
either
as
a
minimal
constitutional
requirement
or
as
taking
the
values
and
policies
of
furman
even
further.
and
there
is
a
very
strong
indication
that
alabama
did
write
on
a
clean
slate
after
gregg,
proffitt,
and
jurek
made
it
clear
preclusion
was
not
constitutionally
required
because
in
1977,
a
year
after
the
'76
cases
from
this
court,
alabama
passed
a
new
criminal
code
which
totally
restructured
and
redefined
everything
from
trespassing
to
homicide.
and
in
that
new
criminal
code
a
year
after
gregg,
proffitt,
and
jurek,
the
alabama
legislature
incorporated
by
reference
and
thereby
readopted
the
alabama
capital
punishment
statute,
including
the
preclusion
clause.
and
we
think
that
evidences
that
the
purpose
--
at
least
as
of
1977
and
arguably
as
early
as
'75
when
the
statute
was
originally
enacted--was
to
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
furman.
otherwise,
why
would
they
not
have
left
it
in
there
after
this
court
made
clear
in
'76
it
was
not
constitutionally
required?
and
everything
is
geared
in
the
statute
towards
the
preclusion
of
lesser
included
offenses.
it
is
especially
important
in
alabama
statutes
because,
for
example,
the
verdict
form
requirement
--
that
is
the
way
where
you
insist
that
the
jury
proceed
as
cautiously
and
as
reluctantly
as
possible
to
protect
the
reliability
of
fact
finding.
but
if
you
do
not
have
preclusion
and
you
have
got
a
verdict
form
where
the
jury
says,
"we
fix
his
penalty
at
death,"
absent
preclusion,
where
are
you?
you
are
back
at
roberts.
you
are
back
at
woodson,
where
this
court
said
there
would
be
--
or
the
joint
opinion
said
there
would
be
a
risk
of
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
through
nullification,
through
the
mechanism
of
lesser
included
offenses.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
it
is
different,
except
when
you
take
the
alabama
common
law
rule
or
even
the
federal
rule
on
a
reasonable,
rational
basis,
you
are
going
to
have
--
all
the
defendant
has
to
do
to
get
a
chance
at
jury
emotion,
jury
prejudice,
jury
bias
in
his
favor
is
take
the
stand
and
say,
"yes,
but
i
do
not
kill.
what
happened?
i
did
not
intend
to
do
it."
that
is
in
essence
roberts
because
however
incredible
in
alabama,
the
evidence
is
it
goes
to
the
jury.
and
the
tendency
of
trial
court
judges
is
to
interpret
lesser
includes
really
broadly,
not
so
much,
one
would
suppose,
to
protect
the
defendant.
it
is
just
to
protect
themselves
against
any
chance
of
reversal.
unless
the
defendant
objects
to
it
--
and
in
some
cases
it
would
be
in
the
defendant's
interest
not
to
have
the
instruction
as
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no,
sir.
and
those
cases
are
the
rare
exception
generally.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir,
and
we
point
out
two
examples
under
the
alabama
statute
in
section
8
of
our
brief,
one
case
of
which
is
pending
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
of
ritter
v.
state,
one
where
the
alabama
supreme
court
promulgated
the
elements
or
announced
the
elements.
in
that
case,
the
non-trigger
man
said,
"we
talked
about
it,
we
planned
on
doing
it.
the
only
reason
i
did
not
do
it
is
because
my
co-defendant
was
in
my
way.
i
am
glad
we
did
it.
i
do
not
have
any
remorse.
too
bad
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me."
in
that
case,
even
in
alabama,
he
would
not
have
got
a
lesser
included.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
and
the
same
thing
with
the
co-defendant
case.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
the
defendant
would
not
be
convicted
of
a
capital
--
that
has
never
happened.
in
terms
of
the
statute,
in
terms
of
the
alabama
appellate
courts'
statements
about
the
statute,
that
would
not
convict
him
of
the
capital
offense.
they
would
be
told
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
nothing.
there
is
no
way
that
the
man
--
they
have
to
fix
the
penalty
at
death.
that
is
just
put
in
there
so
the
jury
--
"well,
now,
look,
you
have
been
here
in
court
today.
you
have
had
your
time
off
from
your
job.
but
this
is
serious
business.
a
man
could
die
if
you
are
not
careful."
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
if
they
disagree
on
the
death
penalty
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
not
necessarily,
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
one
would
not
assume
so
from
that.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
i
think
it
reads
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
it
may
mean
shall.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
i
do
not
know.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
individual
judge.
but
it
is
clear
that
until
they
do
that,
there
is
no
way
you
can
have
a
capital
conviction
and
sentence
in
alabama
because
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
right,
in
which
case
the
prosecutor
had
better
be
thinking
about
reinducting.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
the
possibility
of
a
mistrial?
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
sir,
it
does,
and
defense
attorneys
will
argue
that.
"look,
they
will
tell
you
you
are
supposed
to,
but
you
do
not
have
to.
you
can
get
a
mistrial.
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
case
he
did.
and
also
in
another
case,
the
jacobs
case
which
came
to
cert
and
was
denied
last
year,
the
same
thing
happened.
where
defendants
ask
in
this
case
for
instruction,
he
got
it.
he
was
reading
what
the
--
here
he
was
giving
his
oral
charge.
but
two
pages,
three
pages
over,
four
pages,
on
page
13
he
read
to
the
jury
again
that
same
thing
exactly
what
the
defense
attorney
asked,
the
second
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
13.
so,
the
jury
knew
about
the
mistrial
and
reindictment
option
in
this
case.
and
we
think
that
is
a
significant
safeguard.
now
--
mr.
edward
e.
carnes
no,
sir.
your
honor,
there
are
no
appellate
opinions
in
which
that
has
happened,
and
i
do
not
know
of
any
trial
court
decisions.
it
is
possible
there
were
some
of
those
that
just
have
not
reached
the
appellate
stage
yet.
but
under
the
statute
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
capital
offense.
and
this
is
part
of
the
strategy
that
will
play
into
the
defense
attorney's
argument,
closing
argument.
you
do
not
have
to.
that
is
what
the
mistrial
is
about.
i
have
asked
the
judge
to
tell
you
about
it.
listen
to
it.
if
you
think
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
come
back
here
and
refuse
to
fix
the
penalty
at
death.
i
just
told
the
judge
you
cannot
decide.
much
boils
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
thinks
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
innocent
of
a
capital
crime
will
be
convicted
of
a
capital
crime
and
sentenced
to
death
because
of
preclusion.
we
argue
because
of
those
safeguards
it
will
not
be.
they
point
to
the
conviction
statistics.
ninety-six
percent.
"my
goodness,
how
can
you
say
innocent
men
are
not
being
convicted
wrongfully?
ninety-six
percent."
the
whole
point
in
that
is
that
preclusion,
as
this
court
recognized
in
keeble,
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
--
historically
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
prosecutor,
not
the
defendant.
and
any
prosecutor
who
knows
he
does
not
have
the
protection
of
lesser
included
offenses
because
of
that
preclusion
clause
is
going
to
be
extremely
reluctant
and
extremely
hesitant
to
bring
any
case
as
a
capital
case
unless
he
is
absolutely
certain
that
not
only
is
the
man
guilty,
but
he
can
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
