justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carnes,
just
so
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
comments,
you
are
saying
there
is
very
strong
evidence
supporting
the
intentional
killing
here.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
denying,
however,
the
fact
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
evidence
for
the
jury
to
have
accepted
some
of
what
the
defendant
said
and
found
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
had
there
not
been
this
special
rule
for
death
cases,
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
lesser-included-offense
instruction
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
say
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carnes,
before
you
leave
that
last
one,
how
does
one
know
whether
a
jury
--
say
a
jury
acquitted
a
defendant.
how
would
one
know
whether
they
found
him
not
guilty
of
anything
or
determined,
as
you
describe
it,
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
lesser
included
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
is
the
legal
significance
of
their
ability
to
reach
a
totally
meaningless
and
irrelevant
conclusion
then?
justice
potter
stewart
i
really
do
not
understand
the
force
of
the
argument.
but
that
is
all
right.
i
do
not
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
have
to
show
intent
to
kill,
do
you,
in
your
felony
murder
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
do
in
your
ordinary
first
degree
murder
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
in
felony
murder
you
do
not
have
to
show
intent
to
kill,
do
you,
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
first
degree
murder,
non-felony
murder,
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
not,
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
he
could
not.
the
reason
they
were
not
told
so
in
keeble
was
i
think
even
the
court
opinion
did
not
indicate
that
he
could
have
been
indicted
in
the
first
instance
for
the
lesser
included
offense
--
justice
potter
stewart
--in
a
federal
district
court
since
that
court
had
only
the
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
it
by
the
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
he
certainly
could
not
have
been
originally
indicted
for
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
roberts
against
louisiana
in
which
that
point
was
made,
as
i
remember
--
and
the
only
one
of
those
three
cases
in
which
that
was
made
because
only
in
louisiana
did
the
practice
exist
of
requiring
an
instruction
on
lesser
included
offense
in
every
single
case,
whether
or
not
there
was
any
justification
for
it.
that
is
quite
different
from
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
some
cases
--
not
only
hypothetical
cases,
but
real
cases
--
where
it
is
either
first
degree
murder
perpetrated
by
this
defendant
or
he
is
absolutely
innocent.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
hundred
eyewitnesses
to
a
brutal,
premeditated,
intentional
killing
and
his
defense
is
"that
was
not
me,
that
was
my
twin
brother,"
then
he
is
either
guilty
clearly
of
first
degree
murder,
or
he
is
entirely
innocent.
there
is
no
room
for
a
lesser
included
offense
in
a
case
like
that,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
do
exist.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
point,
general
carnes,
are
you
familiar
with
any
alabama
reported
decisions
treating
of
the
situation
where
a
jury
found
a
man
guilty
of
a
capital
offense
but
did
not
fix
the
penalty
at
death?
