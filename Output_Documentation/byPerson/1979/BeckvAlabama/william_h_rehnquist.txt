justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
went
also
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
question
did
you
raise
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klingsberg
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
let
me
get
back
a
moment
to
that
earlier
question
i
asked
you.
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
i
take
it
was
delivered
by
mr.
justice
maddox,
he
starts
out
saying,
"petitioner
beck
raises
only
one
issue
here,"
and
then
there
is
a
colon.
then
he
says,
"whether
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
erred
in
its
finding
that
the
alabama
death
penalty
statute
is
not
in
violation
of
article
iii,
section
43,
article
v,
section
124,
and
amendment
38
of
the
1901
constitution
of
alabama."
do
you
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
unless
the
defendant
admits
that
he
had
the
intent
to
kill,
the
evidence
of
his
intent
to
kill
is
necessarily
circumstantial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
jury
is
entitled
to
disbelief
of
petitioner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
robbery
with
intent
to
kill
by
definition,
if
you
succeed
in
the
robbery,
you
are
not
going
to
kill
the
man?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
alabama
law,
robbery
with
intent
to
kill
means
that
you
plan
to
first
rob
him
and
then
kill
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
did
suggest
that
the
jury
might
disagree
on
the
death
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
violating
their
instructions
if
they
disagree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
told
that
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty,
you
must
fix
the
death
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carnes,
in
the
appendix
at
page
9
at
the
last
paragraph
of
the
page,
the
trial
judge,
unless
i
misread
the
language
of
his
instructions,
he
said,
"ladies
and
gentlemen,
all
12
of
you
must
agree
before
you
can
reach
any
verdict
in
this
case."
he
was
following
that
line
of
reasoning,
was
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
guilt-finding
stage,
does
it
not
at
least
tend
to
eliminate
the
arbitrariness
that
was
criticized
in
furman
if
the
jury
is
forced
to
fish
or
cut
bait
as
to
whether
this
man
either
committed
a
capital
offense
or
did
not
commit
it?
