mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
interesting
thing
about
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision,
mr.
justice
white,
is
they
never
addressed
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
an
interesting
point.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
is
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
respondents
in
this
case
are
in
basic
agreement
with
the
petitioners
that
the
d.c.
circuit
erred
in
ordering
the
district
of
columbia
district
court
to
adjudicate
essentially
the
same
controversy
with
the
same
documents
and
the
same
legal
issues
as
that
involved
in
the
already
pending
delaware
litigation.
the
principal
concern
of
the
federal
government
in
this
area,
however,
is
not
to
urge
this
court
to
adopt
rules,
procedural
rules
that
favor
foia
requesters
or
submitters,
but
rather
to
urge
the
court
to
adopt
procedural
rules
to
insure
that
federal
agencies
are
not
put
in
a
position
where
they
are
subject
to
inconsistent
and
perhaps
even
irreconcilable
injunctive
orders
of
different
federal
courts,
with
one
court
requiring
the
agency
to
turn
over
to
the
public
certain
records
whose
disclosure
another
court
has
enjoined.
now,
this
problem
is
unlikely
to
arise
when
the
first
suit
brought
is
an
action
by
a
requester
under
the
foia.
in
those
circumstances,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
mentioned,
the
practice
has
generally
been
for
the
agency
to
notify
the
submitter
of
the
pendency
of
the
foia
request
or
of
a
legal
action
if
one
has
been
filed,
and
to
give
it
the
opportunity
to
intervene
if
it
believes
that
its
interests
are
not
adequately
protected
by
the
agency.
the
more
significant
problem,
however,
which
is
clearly
illustrated
by
this
case
occurs
when
the
first
suit
brought
is
a
so-called
reverse
foia
action
by
a
submitter
of
information
to
the
government
and
when
the
submitter
obtains
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
agency
from
disclosing
the
records
in
question.
the
federal
government's
view
is
that
a
second
district
court
in
a
suit
subsequently
brought
by
an
foia
requester
should
not
proceed
to
adjudicate
the
disclosability
of
the
very
same
documents
that
are
the
subject
of
the
first
suit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
use
the
phrase
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand
that
the
foia
itself
doesn't
give
any
rights
to
submitters,
but
we
use
the
phrase
reverse
foia
action
here
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
just
as
a
shorthand,
as
mr.
shniderman
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
be
happy
to
call
them
chrysler
actions,
if
that
would
please
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
perhaps
i
will
continue
to
call
them
reverse
foia
actions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
and
here
there
are
allegations
that
the
trade
secrets
act
and
section
6(b)(1)
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act
prohibited
the
agency
from
disclosing
the
television
accident
reports.
now,
the
first
and
most
obvious
reason
why
we
think
that
the
d.c.
circuit
should
not
have
ordered
the
district
court
to
continue
to
take
this
case
is
one
that
mr.
shniderman
has
already
touched
on,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
it
because
of
its
obvious
importance
to
this
case,
and
that
is
the
very
language
of
the
foia
itself.
section
552(a)(4)(b)
empowers
the
district
court
to
order
the
disclosure
of
agency
records
that
are
being
"improperly
withheld
under
the
foia."
and
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
an
agency's
obedience
to
a
federal
court
order
can
in
no
sense
be
regarded
as
improper.
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
believes
that
the
injunctive
order
that
was
issued
in
delaware
is
based
on
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
law
and
it
has
appealed
that
injunction
to
the
third
circuit
and
it
has
now
filed
a
certiorari
petition
in
this
court.
but
the
commission
is
bound
to
obey
the
injunction
until
and
unless
it
is
set
aside.
we
simply
don't
understand
--
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
didn't
bother
to
explain
--
how
the
agency
could
have
"improperly
withheld"
television
accident
reports
from
the
requesters
when
it
refused
to
turn
over
those
documents
solely
because
of
the
outstanding
delaware
injunction.
the
requesters
never
addressed
this
issue
in
their
brief
and
they
never
explained
what
the
commission
is
supposed
to
do
if
it
is
subjected
to
inconsistent
injunctions.
now,
along
with
the
petitioners,
the
government
also
believes
that
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
is
wrong
for
yet
another
somewhat
broader
reason,
and
that
is
that
it
violates
fundamental
principles
of
judicial
comity.
the
court
has
often
applied
the
general
rule
that
a
federal
court
should
refrain
from
duplicating
or
interfering
with
the
proceedings
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
did
not.
we
filed
a
brief
at
the
petition
stage
and
that
is
why
we
appear
here
as
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
but
it
was
not
because
we
did
not
believe
that
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
was
wrong.
we
said
precisely
that
we
thought
it
was.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
do
concede
that
there
are
eleven.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
we
think
in
the
foia
area
there
is
a
strong
analogy
to
be
drawn
to
cases
involving
in
rem
or
quasi-in
rem
jurisdiction.
in
such
cases,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
second
court
in
which
an
action
is
filed
must
always
defer
to
the
court
first
asserting
jurisdiction,
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion
but
as
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity.
so
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
itself
recognized
that
actions
seeking
to
require
or
to
prohibit
the
disclosure
of
copies
of
specific
documents
are
in
many
ways
indistinguishable
from
actions
seeking
the
particular
disposition
of
a
specific
piece
of
property.
in
both
types
of
cases,
exclusive
control
over
the
property
is
essential
to
effectuate
the
court's
judgment.
it
is
obvious
that
an
injunction
preventing
release
of
certain
information
is
absolutely
useless
unless
it
prevents
agency
action
everywhere.
and
by
the
same
token,
an
order
requiring
disclosure
of
information
obviously
can't
be
limited
to
a
single
jurisdiction
and
would
forever
foreclose
a
subsequent
non-disclosure
order
from
ever
being
effected.
in
short,
foia
claims
or
reverse
foia
claims,
when
they
concern
the
same
agency
records,
we
believe
must
be
adjudicated
in
one
and
not
multiple
jurisdictions.
and
we
believe
that
it
makes
the
most
sense
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
administration
to
centralize
that
litigation
in
the
first
court
to
assume
jurisdiction,
subject,
of
course,
to
that
court's
further
order
transferring
the
case
to
some
other
district.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
candidly
acknowledged
that
its
decision
would
require
duplicate
of
litigation,
but
it
felt
that
that
result
was
justified
in
this
case
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
the
reason
that
they
did
not
offer,
but
they
offered
several
others
which
we
think
are
equally
meritless.
we
discussed
them
in
our
brief.
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
about
the
d.c.
circuit's
approach,
its
so-called
creative
approach
or
flexible
approach,
as
the
requesters
call
it,
is
that
it
totally
fails
to
offer
a
satisfactory
solution
to
what
we
believe
is
the
most
pressing
problem
in
this
area,
which
is
the
very
real
possibility
that
a
federal
agency
may
be
subject
to
conflicting
injunctive
orders
of
two
separate
courts.
the
procedural
device
is,
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said
is,
"we're
not
going
to
require
that
the
litigation
be
centralized
in
the
first
court.
it
can
proceed
wherever
the
foia
action
is
filed,
despite
the
pendency
of
another
case,
and
there
are
a
number
of
procedural
devices
that
can
be
used
to
try
to
consolidate
the
litigation.
but
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
that
the
procedural
devices
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
rely
on,
such
as
section
1404(a)
of
title
28,
rule
19
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
while
they
may
be
useful
in
some
cases
to
accomplish
a
consolidation
clearly
can't
be
used
in
every
case,
and
then
you
are
left
with
the
specter
of
possibly
conflicting
inconsistent
injunctions.
for
example,
section
1404
only
allows
transfer
to
a
district
in
which
the
case
could
originally
have
been
brought,
and
rule
19
often
can't
be
used
to
bring
a
non-party
into
a
law
suit
because
of
venue
or
service
of
process
problems.
and
perhaps
more
important,
the
principal
defect
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
approach
is
that
it
relies
heavily
on
procedural
devices
that
we
submit
are
simply
ill-suited
to
foia
litigation,
where
a
plaintiff
need
not
have
any
legal
basis
or
any
legal
interest
in
the
documents
that
he
requests.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
suggestion
that
foia
submitters
or
federal
agencies
should
make
use
of
the
so
called
requester
class
action
is
totally
unworkable
in
practice
because
every
person
in
the
united
states,
indeed
i
suppose
every
person
in
the
world,
is
a
member
of
the
class.
anybody
can
make
a
request
under
the
foia,
and
i
might
add
it's
significant,
we
think,
as
mr.
shniderman
said,
that
the
requesters
in
this
case
have
abandoned
any
reliance
on
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
this
court.
moreover,
if
in
fact
the
commission
had
attempted
join
these
requesters
in
the
delaware
litigation
under
rule
19,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
later
said
they
should
have
attempted,
tactic
would
have
been
of
little
practical
value
in
avoiding
duplicate
of
litigation
or
inconsistent
judgments,
because
even
if
the
commission
could
have
succeeded
in
joining
the
requesters,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
far
from
clear
in
light
of
the
venue
and
service
of
process
problems
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
all
that
would
have
been
accomplished
is
that
these
two
particular
requesters
would
have
been
bound
by
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
delaware
judgment.
however,
anyone
in
the
united
states
would
still
have
been
free
to
file
an
foia
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
access
to
the
very
same
documents,
and
under
the
d.c.
circuit's
theory,
since
these
new
requesters
would
not
have
been
parties
to
or
bound
by
the
delaware
litigation,
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
continue
to
litigate
and
to
receive
an
adjudication
of
their
foia
claim
in
the
district
of
columbia,
despite
the
existence
of
the
delaware
injunction.
so
we
think
that
this
so-called
flexible
approach
just
won't
work
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases,
and
could
lead
to
what
we
believe
is
the
most
important
problem
in
this
area,
one
that
the
court
i
think
should
be
concerned
about
in
resolving
the
issue,
which
is
the
very
real
possibility
that
exists
in
this
case
and
these
types
of
cases
of
an
agency
having
to
either
comply
with
an
order
requiring
or
an
order
prohibiting
disclosure
of
the
precisely
the
same
document
on
pain
of
contempt.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
has
been
suggested,
but
there
is
certainly
no
case
that
the,
i
mean
the
requesters
and
judge
robinson
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
an
effort
to
explain
what
they
meant
by
"creative
approach,"
listed
every
conceivable
procedural
remedy
that
might
exist
in
this
area,
but
there
are
no
cases
that
ever
applied
it
and
we
don't
think
it
would
be
workable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
think
that
the
first,
the
second
court
in
this
case,
the
d.c.
circuit,
district
court,
could
have
stayed
its
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
would
have
been
error.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
so.
first
of
all,
there's
of
course
the
improperly
withheld
argument
which
exists
in
that
situation.
by
the
time
the
second
district
court
case
was
filed,
the
commission
was
already
under
an
injunction
not
to
disclose
the
documents.
that's
reason
1
why
the
d.c.
district
court
should
not
have
continued
to
adjudicate
the
case.
but
secondly,
the
problem
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely,
and
that's
what
the
commission
did
here.
it
appealed
that
injunction
to
the
third
circuit,
which
is
affirmed,
and
it's
filed
a
certiorari
petition
in
this
court.
but
until
that
injunction
is
set
aside,
i
don't
see
how
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
assuming
that
no
temporary
restraining
order
had
been
entered
in
the
delaware
case
in
this
court,
then
we
wouldn't
have
our
first
argument,
which
is
the
improperly
withheld
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
we
think
that
the
principles
of
comity
would
apply
here,
even
if
the
first
court
did
not
come
to
judgment,
because
i
think,
for
the
reason
i
gave,
the
analogy
to
the
in
rem
or
quasi-in
rem
unless
you
apply
a
bright
line
test
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
you
don't
have
to
reach
what
i
have
stated
is
a
broader
theory,
because
we
do
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
said
that
we
would
have
turned
--
as
i
recall,
we
said
in
late
march
or
early
april,
1975,
that
we
were
planning
to
turn
the
documents
over
on
may
first.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
could
arise
in
the
situation
where
on
april
10th
the
submitters
ran
into
the
delaware
district
court
and
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
which
i
think
it's
unlikely,
you're
right,
the
delaware
district
court
might
have
refused.
the
case
could
then
have
been
litigated,
could
have
gone
to
judgment
in
the
very
short
period
of
time
between
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that's
absolutely
right;
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
it's
not
exempt,
and
we
would
have
turned
it
over;
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
we
do.
we
have
addressed
that
very
briefly
in
our
footnote.
we
think
that
there
is
a
lot
of
controversy
between
the
requesters
and
the
commission
as
to
whether
these
documents
are
being
improperly
withheld.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
between
the
requesters
and
the
commission
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
whether
the
documents
that
the
requesters
have
asked
for
are
being
improperly
withheld
under
the
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
we
think
should
have
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
documents
were
not
being
improperly
withheld
and
that
the
requesters
had
not
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me,
that's
right,
judge
ritchey
had,
although
on
a
different
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that's
right.
we
think
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
could
be
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
that
is
a
possibility.
we
say
that
judge
ritchey
could
have
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
don't
think
there
is
any
practical
difference
between
judge
ritchey's
having
said
i
am
going
to
stay
my
order,
because
if
a
permanent
injunction
was
issued
in
delaware
and
never
overturned
that
stay
would
have
been
an
indefinite
duration.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
it
was
overturned
then
it
is
conceivable
that
these
requesters
could
have
just
asked
for
the
documents
at
that
point.
they
wouldn't
have
needed
a
lawsuit
to
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think
that
the
cases
in
this
court
have
said
that
under
rules
of
comity
a
case
can
be
dismissed,
it
need
not
be
stayed.
the
court
has
to
decide
what
is
the
appropriate
remedy
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
thank
you.
