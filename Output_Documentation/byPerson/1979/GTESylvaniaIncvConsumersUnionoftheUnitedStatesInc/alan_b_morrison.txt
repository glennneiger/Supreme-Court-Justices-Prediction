mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
virtually
from
the
start
of
this
litigation,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
have
opposed
the
efforts
of
the
requesting
parties
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
litigate
this
case
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
have
consistently
asked
why
didn't
you
go
to
delaware?
and
i
want
to
answer
that
question
today
in
three
separate
ways.
we
didn't
go
to
delaware
for
three
reasons.
first,
we
didn't
want
to
go
to
delaware;
second,
we
didn't
have
to
go
to
delaware;
and,
third,
it
is
the
wrong
question
to
ask.
and
the
proper
question
to
ask
is
why
didn't
the
parties,
and
in
particular
the
government,
move
to
take
the
cases
in
delaware
and
bring
them
down
to
the
district
of
columbia
where
everybody
was
here,
the
case
could
have
gone
forward
for
judgment
on
the
merits
in
one
court,
this
one.
now,
bluntly
stated,
this
case
involves
forum
shopping
by
all
the
parties.
there
is
nothing
inherently
evil
in
forum
shopping.
congress
has
provided
alternate
venue
provisions
and
they
are
there
to
be
exercised.
the
manufacturers
went
to
delaware
because
they
believed
it
would
be
favorable
to
then
to
go
to
delaware.
it
is
not,
of
course,
the
principal
place
of
business
of
any
of
them.
in
fact,
four
lawsuits
were
not
even
filed
in
delaware,
they
were
filed
elsewhere
and
later
transferred
to
delaware.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
my
point
is
that,
like
saying
this
is
a
forum
shopping
case,
we
don't
decide
anything.
the
manufacturers
were
there
in
delaware,
despite
the
absence
of
any
witnesses,
despite
the
absence
of
land
counsel.
the
documents
weren't
there.
they
were
merely
incorporated
in
delaware.
we
wanted
to
avoid
delaware
for
our
own
reasons,
because
we
believed
it
was
inconvenient
and
because
it
was
more
costly
to
litigate
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
clients
would
here,
the
counsel
was
here.
we
considered
going
up
to
delaware
and
moving
to
intervene
in
delaware
and
attempting
to
have
the
case
transferred
here
under
1404(a).
but
as
soon
as
we
thought
about
that,
we
saw
we
were
in
a
box
because
there
are
cases
that
have
held
that
if
you
voluntarily
come
into
an
action
as
an
intervenor
you
waive
your
right
to
go
to
ask
that
the
case
be
transferred.
so
we
were
put
in
a
bind
because
they
had
run
the
race
to
the
courthouse.
indeed,
we
couldn't
have
gone
to
delaware
only
at
the
time
of
filing.
we
would
have
had
to
have
gone
to
the
district
of
delaware,
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania,
and
we
would
have
had
to
have
gone
to
the
western
district
of
new
york
and
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
litigate
a
single
controversy.
now,
we
also
perceived
that
the
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
more
favorably
disposed
of
here.
presumably
the
manufacturers
thought
the
contrary
for
they
went
to
delaware
and
the
general
reputation
of
the
courts
is
at
least
a
matter
that
counsel
believed
they
ought
to
consider
in
their
obligations
to
their
clients.
moreover,
there
had
been
temporary
restraining
orders
already
entered
in
those
other
cases
and
it
was
a
negative
footing
on
which
to
settle
the
cases.
the
result
is
that
we
would
have
been
faced
with
the
situation
at
the
time
we
filed
the
complaint.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
was
four
days
after
the
may
1st
self-imposed
deadline
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
product
safety
commission.
four
days
after
that,
we
did
the
simplest
thing,
we
filed
one
case
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and,
unlike
the
manufacturers,
we
named
every
single
person
who
was
relevant
in
the
controversy
and
tried
to
get
them
all
in
a
single
forum.
so
that
is
why
we
didn't
want
to
go
to
delaware.
and
as
counsel,
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
obligated
to
represent
my
clients
to
the
best
i
can.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
why
don't
i
do
that
now,
mr.
justice
stevens.
let
me
say
first
that
that
argument
was
barely
made
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
barely.
it
was
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
saying
that
it
was
barely
made
because
i
can't
say
to
you
now
that
it
wasn't
made.
i
don't
have
any
recollection
of
it,
but
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
am
only
saying
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
issue
is
here
and
i
am
prepared
answer
it
on
the
merits.
i
didn't
think
it
was
fair
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
not
a
principal
focus,
it
was
certainly
not
an
issue
made
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
there
was
the
first
time
-
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--
but
not
the
second
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
only
the
time
before.
the
remand,
your
honor,
was
in
connection
with
the
fact
of
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
now,
we
suggest
that
there
is
now
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
have
never
suggested
the
product
safety
commission
disobey
that
injunction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
believe
that
they
should
not
disobey
the
injunction
under
walker
v.
birmingham.
what
we
believe
would
happen
is
if
this
case
had
properly
been
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
suggest
that.
what
i
suggested
would
happen
is
if
all
of
the
parties
were
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
part
of
an
ancillary
relief
on
the
merit,
the
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
would
have
power
analogous
to
the
comity
power
to
stay
an
action,
another
action,
to
order
the
petitioners
here
to
seek
to
withdraw
the
injunction
in
delaware,
to
clean
up,
to
be
sure
there
is
no
outstanding
injunction.
after
all
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
i
must
say
this
case
is
unique
in
a
number
of
different
ways
because
it
seeks
to
apply
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
when
we
weren't
a
party,
it
seeks
to
apply
comity
based
on
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
the
petitioners
not
only
say
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
trying.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
know
it
is,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there
is
now
a
final
injunction,
affirmed
on
appeal,
petition
for
certiorari
pending.
but
the
origin
of
the
withholding
argument,
the
improper
withholding
argument,
the
linchpin
was
the
grant
of
the
initial
temporary
restraining
orders
in
the
13
different
cases
that
were
initially
filed.
now,
according
to
this
argument,
if
you
cannot
stop
--
if
you
have
no
jurisdiction,
it
is
because
there
was
no
improper
withholding
from
the
moment
that
that
temporary
restraining
order,
mr.
justice
white,
was
entered
in
those
cases.
and
so
we
could
not
have
from
the
very
start
had
jurisdiction
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
as
soon
as
the
temporary
--
but
the
argument
is
made
that
as
soon
as
the
temporary
restraining
order
is
entered,
there
can
no
longer
--
the
basis
of
withholding
is
no
longer
that
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
withhold
but
that
there
is
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
is
the
argument
that
was
made
the
first
time
and
every
time
it
has
been
made
that
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
now
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there
are
two
things
that
are
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
first
is
that
presumably
if
we
had
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--
and
filed
a
case
and
they
had
gotten
a
temporary
restraining
order
some
place
else
in
another
case
without
us
being
a
party,
at
that
point
our
case
would
have
to
be
dismissed
under
this
argument.
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
this
statute,
which
was
a
broad
remedial
statute,
to
give
the
rights
to
requesting
parties
to
come
in
ever
intended
it
to
be
so
narrowly
construed
--
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
bannercraft
case
suggests
that
the
foia
did
not
strip
a
court
of
its
equity
powers.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
thought,
your
honor,
the
first
that
it
was
simply
not
a
way
of
dealing
with
it,
that
it
might
be
the
case
if
we
had
a
situation
in
which
the
manufacturers
had
gone
in
and
requested
and
brought
an
action,
had
gotten
a
temporary
restraining
order,
gotten
preliminary
injunction,
a
permanent
injunction
in
the
district
court
affirmed
on
appeal,
two
years
later
we
came
in,
at
that
point
we
might
have
a
case
in
which
not
that
we
would
be
precluded
from
proceeding
at
all
but
that
we
might
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
forum.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor
that
is
not
what
i
meant.
what
i
meant
was
you
would
have
to
bring
a
legal
proceeding
of
some
kind,
i
did
not
mean
appeal
in
the
traditional
sense
of
appeal.
i
would
feel
that
in
walker
you
resort
to
judicial
process,
which
is
what
walker
was
talking
about,
and
the
judicial
process
here
that
you
would
be
resorting
to
is
bringing
in
the
manufacturers,
the
submitters,
and
the
product
safety
commission
and
the
requesters
in
one
forum.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
--
the
case
would
have
to
be
transferred.
it
should
have
been
transferred
there.
we
should
have
been
joined
up
there
to
begin
with.
i
would
have
had
no
problems.
they
transferred
the
case
down
here
from
delaware
and
we
would
have
relitigated
it
here.
but
nobody
tried
to
do
that
up
there.
and
if
we
went
up
there
to
do
it,
we
were
likely
to
get
our
heads
chopped
off.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
i
said
it,
i
didn't
mean
it
in
that
sense.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
are
trying
out
first
chance
to
litigate.
we
have
never
litigated
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
believe
that
we
should
have
been
joined
as
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
they
could
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
at
that
point,
no.
the
third
circuit
could
have
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
this
courg
rants
certiorari,
in
our
view,
and
decides
the
case,
if
it
affirms
the
decision
below
we
would
not
be
legally
bound
by
the
outcome
because
we
were
not
parties
to
the
delaware
proceeding.
now,
as
a
matter
of
stare
decisis
of
course,
i
would
advise
my
clients
that
the
likelihood
of
success
is
very
small.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
at
that
point,
your
honor,
if
we
had
brought
a
lawsuit
after
this
court
affirmed
the
decision,
i
might
have
to
go
to
delaware
to
open
the
proceeding
there
and
both
sides
of
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
could
presumably,
if
i
had
to
join
the
agency
up
in
delaware,
if
their
argument
is
right
that
it
is
pursuant
only
to
a
court
order,
it
is
the
court
order
at
that
point
that
would
preclude
me
from
proceeding
on
the
merits
and
i
don't
see
how
it
is
wrongfully
withholding
now
i
could
ever
relitigate.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
problem
with
what
the
government
has
suggested
here
is
that
they
have
made
everything
turn
on
a
race
to
the
courthouse
which
under
these
circumstances
we
could
not
win
and
we
couldn't
win
because
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
consented
to
it
in
most
cases
and
everybody
has
agreed
that
it
is
virtually
automatic.
in
this
kind
of
litigation,
if
you
don't
give
the
submitters
an
injunction,
the
case
is
over.
and
every
case,
every
government
case
that
i
have
seen,
the
government
has
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
we
were
tossed
out
and
the
argument
on
improper
withholding
was
made
at
both
temporary
restraining
and
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
and
that
is
when
we
lost
our
case
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
district
court
initially,
because
we
were
told
we
could
not
proceed.
and
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
government
here
and
the
petitioners
are
making
everything
turn
on
a
race
to
the
courthouse,
a
race
which
we
couldn't
win
for
one
reason,
because
we
let
the
administrative
process
take
its
course.
and
as
sure
as
i
am
standing
here
today,
i
want
to
assure
you
that
this
will
be
the
last
case
we
will
lose
on
a
race
to
the
courthouse,
because
next
time
we
are
going
to
be
smart
and
we
are
going
to
be
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
anyone
who
wants
to
come
in
is
going
to
have
to
come
in
on
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
because
i
don't
think
that
is
a
sensible
way
for
this
court
or
other
courts
to
resolve
these
controversy
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
we
will
get
in
there
before
they
decide
because
most
of
them
don't
make
it
in
the
10
or
20
days
that
the
statute
specifically
authorizes
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
i
believe
is
clear
on
this.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
within
10
days
plus
the
extension.
congress
dealt
with
this
in
the
1974
amendments.
they
were
concerned
about
this
very
problem
and
said
we
recognize
the
interruption
in
administrative
processes
is
not
a
good
thing
in
general,
but
we
also
realize
that
the
agency,
if
they
keep
saying
just
wait
a
couple
days,
a
couple
days,
a
couple
days,
and
you
don't
get
them
--
congress
said
yes,
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
if
the
statutory
time
frames
have
passed.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your,
honor,
there
are
not
going
to
be
very
many
of
those
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
at
that
point,
your
honor,
i
think
what
would
happen
is
--
what
we
urge
is
that
the
government
is
in
the
middle
of
all
of
these
cases,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
government
who
claims
to
be
a
stakeholder
here
and
has
no
other
interest
besides
doing
that,
to
say
we've
got
to
try
to
do
what
we
can,
either
join
the
parties
under
rule
19,
which
we
say
they
should
have
done
here
when
we
are
known
requesters,
not
a
hypothetical
200
million
but
known
requesters
who
have
been
asking
for
these
documents,
or
move
to
transfer
under
1404(a)
which
incidentally
the
government
finally
got
around
to
doing
after
the
first
decision
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
of
course,
at
that
time
it
was
denied
as
untimely.
moreover,
the
government
didn't
have
all
the
cases
in
delaware
to
begin
with,
there
were
four
cases
which
they
moved
from
other
districts
to
delaware
instead
of
moving
them
all
down
to
the
district
of
columbia,
and
we
say
that
is
a
more
sensible
way,
that
neither
requesters
nor
submitters
ought
to
have
the
option
of
unilaterally
choosing
the
forum
and
having
the
other
person
go
up
and
have
to
intervene
and
then
lose
their
right
to
move
to
transfer.
that
is
not
a
sensible
way
of
deciding
in
which
forum
these
cases
ought
to
be
litigated.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
have
to
do
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
all
i
am
suggesting
that
you
do
is
to
look
at
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
and
see
where
the
appropriate
forum
for
litigation
is.
here
it
plainly
would
have
been
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
principal
counsel
for
the
submitters
was
here,
the
agency
was
here,
the
records
were
here,
the
principal
counsel
for
the
requesters
was
here
and
the
requesters
themselves
were
here.
what
if
the
next
case,
someone
requested
the
records
of
somebody
who
was
living
in
alaska
and
it
was
requested
by
a
corporation
down
in
florida,
say
that
one
party
or
the
other
should
automatically,
without
any
consideration
of
fairness,
be
able
to
drag
that
person
to
an
unfriendly
forum
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
sensible
way
to
do
things.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
can
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
just
as
we
resolve
other
issues
where
there
are
two
parties
filing
lawsuits
in
just
the
patent
area,
it
happens
all
the
time.
the
difference
in
the
patent
area
is
that
the
race
isn't
fixed
because
here
if
the
government
decides
to
release
the
documents
the
requesters
no
longer
can
be
in
the
race.
there
is
no
case
of
controversy.
we
admit
that,
without
the
bringing
in
of
another
party.
but
once
the
government
says
that
they
are
not
going
to
turn
the
documents
over,
then
the
submitters
can't
win
the
race
because
by
that
definition
they
don't
have
a
dispute.
indeed,
they
don't
have
a
dispute
with
the
agency
until
the
agency
affirmatively
decides
to
release
the
documents.
so
whatever
the
sense
of
applying
the
race
to
the
courthouse
notion
may
be
another
context.
it
doesn't
make
sense
here.
it
won't
work.
we
need
other
procedural
devices,
rule
19
and
1404(a),
in
order
to
be
able
to
consolidate
the
cases
in
a
single
forum.
now,
in
addition
to
the
problems
created
by
the
race
to
the
courthouse,
we
are
going
to
have
situations
here.
it
is
purely
fortuitous
that
we
were
able
to
consolidate
all
of
the
cases
brought
by
the
submitters
in
delaware,
and
that
is
only
because
the
fact
that
all
the
corporations
were
there.
in
the
absence
of
that,
we
would
have
had
litigation
around
the
country
and
indeed
it
could
have
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
believe
we
would,
hour
honor,
and
that
is
because
there
is
a
special
venue
provision
under
the
foia
that
permits
an
action
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
so
under
the
"might
have
been
brought
test"
of
1404(a),
an
action
under
the
foia
can
always
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia,
so
that
that
likelihood
makes
it
much
more
probable
that
we
will
be
able
to
consolidate
the
cases
in
a
single
forum.
now,
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
will
work
in
every
case.
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
if
the
district
courts
are
told
you've
got
to
try
to
work
this
thing
out
flexibly
instead
of
just
simply
saying
you
lost
your
case
to
the
courthouse,
so
good-by.
that
is
all
we
are
talking
about,
a
temporary
restraining
order
here
is
nothing
more
than
the
filing
of
a
complaint
and
an
automatic
grant.
they
said
--
the
petitioners
say
so,
and
i
think
footnote
11
of
their
brief,
they
say
it
is
automatic
and
we
don't
dispute
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
agree.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
do
have
a
problem
of
forum
shopping
and
that
is
what
it
is,
and
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it.
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
principle
that
your
honor
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
agree.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is,
of
course,
true.
everything
under
the
faoi,
congress
can
make
any
changes
it
wants
in
the
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
am
here
in
court
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
or
california,
as
other
cases
have
been
involved.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
they
object
to
taking
a
trip
to
the
district
of
columbia,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
because
they
don't
want
to
be
here
and
we
don't
want
to
be
up
there.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
this
race
to
the
courthouse
theory
which
has
been
put
forth
is
going
to
produce
unnecessary
and
premature
litigation.
it
is
going
to
produce
an
unnecessary
interruption
of
the
administrative
process
as
parties
are
racing
to
the
courthouse
to
get
their
choice
of
forum
so
that
everything
can
be
consolidated
there
because
they
are
going
to
win,
and
it
provides
an
absolute
choice
of
forum
to
one
side
or
the
other
without
regard
to
the
merits.
we
don't
think
that
is
a
sensible
way
of
dealing
with
it,
but
if
that
is
what
the
court
says
we
believe
we
can
live
with
it
in
the
first
case,
and
we
are
here
today
because
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
there
is
a
problem
with
judicial
administration.
we
agree
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
proceedings
consolidated
in
one
forum.
we
disagree
that
the
race
to
the
courthouse
with
one
side
a
guaranteed
winner
and
the
other
side
a
guaranteed
loser
as
a
sensible
way
of
resolving
that
conflict.
what
we
urge
is
that
the
flexibility
entailed
in
rule
19
and
1404(a)
be
used
to
solve
the
problems
in
virtually
every
case
and
that
we
don't
think
there
are
significant
problems
that
cannot
be
worked
out
through
them.
thank
you,
your
honors.
