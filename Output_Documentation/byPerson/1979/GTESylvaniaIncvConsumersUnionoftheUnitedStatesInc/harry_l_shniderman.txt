mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please.
we
are
here
for
a
second
time
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
the
second
time
that
court
has
placed
its
district
court
on
a
collision
course
with
the
district
court
for
delaware
and
with
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioners
here
are
twelve
television
manufacturers
which
furnished
information
to
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
with
respect
to
television
related
accidents.
the
respondents
are
prominent
consumer
groups
who
have
sought
access
to
that
data.
in
early
'75,
the
commission
notified
all
interested
parties
that
it
was
prepared
to
release
the
data,
and
shortly
thereafter
the
twelve
manufacturers
brought
suit
in
four
district
courts.
most
of
the
suits
were
brought
in
the
delaware
district
court;
the
balance
were
brought
in
other
district
courts
not
in
the
district
of
columbia.
temporary
restraining
orders
were
promptly
obtained
and
the
non-delaware
cases
were
transferred
to
delaware
with
consent.
in
may
'75,
about
two
weeks
after
the
manufacturers
filed
their
suits,
the
requesters
brought
a
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
and
joined
the
manufacturers
as
defendants.
the
district
of
columbia
suit
was
fairly
promptly
dismissed
by
judge
ritchey
in
september
of
'75.
he
found
a
lack
of
a
case
of
controversy
between
the
requesters
and
the
agency
because
the
agency
stood
quite
willing
to
release
the
documents
when
not
enjoined
from
doing
so.
and
he
found
a
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
as
against
the
manufacturers
because
no
documents
were
being
sought
from
the
manufacturers.
in
october
'75,
chief
judge
latchum
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
in
the
delaware
case.
he
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well,
it
was
really
a
--
i
guess
in
view
of
chrysler,
it
is
clear
that
a
reverse
foia
case
is
really
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
--
there
is
no
such
thing.
it
is
a
very
convenient
shorthand
way
of
describing
the
chrysler
kind
of
suit,
and
that
is
what
basically
we
have
and
basically
what
the
third
circuit
ultimately
found
that
we
had.
in
any
event,
judge
latchum
found
that
section
6(b)(1)
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act
barred
disclosure
of
the
requested
data
and
he
entered
a
preliminary
injunction.
now,
judge
ritchie
had
explicitly
noted
that
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
requesters
to
seek
to
intervene
in
delaware
but
they
did
not
do
so.
instead
they
appealed,
as
they
had
a
right
to
do,
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
july
of
'77,
approximately
ten
months
after
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reversed
the
decision
below
and
directed
the
case
to
proceed
on
the
merits,
in
spite
of
the
delaware
preliminary
injunction.
this
court
granted
certiorari,
summarily
vacated
the
judgment
below,
and
it
remanded
the
case
for
reconsideration
by
the
court
below
because
by
that
time
there
had
been
a
permanent
injunction
which
had
been
entered
by
the
delaware
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reconsidered
the
matter
and
ultimately
reaffirmed
its
decision
and
hence
we
are
here.
in
april,
in
the
meantime,
in
april
of
'79,
the
third
circuit
affirmed
judge
latchum's
decision
on
the
permanent
injunction.
now,
in
that
proceeding
the
respondents
in
this
case
appeared
as
amicus
curiae
on
a
procedural
issue,
and
the
consumer
federation
of
america,
of
which
at
least
one
requester
is
a
member,
appeared
as
an
amicus
on
the
merits.
the
delaware
case
thus
is
final
except
for
a
pending
petition
for
certiorari
filed
by
the
agency
in
this
court.
now,
the
court
below
in
this
case
first
found
that
there
was
a
case
of
controversy
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
then
preliminary
and
final
judgment,
the
injunction.
second,
it
failed
to
find,
failed
to
discuss
the
argument
that
had
been
made
by
both
the
agency
and
by
us
that
there
had
not
been
an
improper
withholding
of
the
documents
within
the
meaning
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
because
the
agency
was
willing
to
produce
the
documents
but
was
enjoined
from
doing
so.
and
third,
it
concluded
that
neither
principles
of
comity
nor
collateral
estoppel
preclude
the
district
of
columbia
from
going
forward.
indeed,
in
its
second
opinion
the
district
of
columbia
court
advised
and
directed
the
trial
court
to
consider
whether
it
may
enjoin
the
manufacturers
from
enforcing
the
injunction
in
delaware
in
the
event
the
injunction
were
disobeyed.
and
it
also
commented
on
class
action
opportunities
for
joining
all
requesters,
a
technique
which
had
been
espoused
by
neither
side
and
to
this
day
is
not
espoused
by
either
side.
we
rely
on
three
wholly
independent
arguments
for
urging
reversal
to
this
court.
the
first
ground
is
quite
simple
and
it
is
this.
the
freedom
of
information
act,
in
section
552(a)(4)(b),
provides
a
requester
with
access
to
a
district
court
which
is
given
jurisdiction,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
to
order
the
production
of
any
agency
records
--
and
here
are
the
key
words
--
improperly
withheld.
we
have
here
a
permanent
injunction
which
bars
disclosure
of
the
records
which
the
agency
would
willingly
produce.
it
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
this
case
in
its
entirety
simply
to
rule
that
the
documents
are
not
improperly
withheld
in
the
circumstances
when
the
agency
is
permanently
or
indeed
temporarily
enjoined
from
producing
them.
the
injunction
must
obviously
be
obeyed
unless
or
until
it
is
vacated.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
would
suppose
they
would
have
had
such
a
right
and
they
still
may
have
such
a
right.
that
is
something
that
this
court
would
have
to
decide,
whether
they
have
waived
that
right
or
not.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
of
course.
of
course,
certainly
and
they
had
every
opportunity
to
do
so
at
all
levels,
as
i
would
point
out.
now,
the
entire
orientation
of
this
act
--
and
i
am
talking
about
the
freedom
of
information
act
now
--
is
to
restrict
unbridled
administrative
decisions.
no
one
before
has
ever
suggested
that
the
agency
is
required
to
defy
court
orders.
the
act
is
directed
at
agency
conduct,
it
is
not
directed
at
courts,
it
is
not
directed
at
court
restraining
orders
blocking
record
production.
in
chrysler,
this
court
recognized
that
a
submitter
of
documents
has
a
right
to
sue
to
restrain
production
of
those
documents.
now,
if
a
suit
is
authorized,
it
obviously
has
a
prospect
of
success,
and
this
means
the
prospect
that
there
will
be
a
restraint
on
the
agency,
and
such
a
court
restraint
on
an
agency
cannot
be
translated
into
an
improper
agency
withholding.
there
are
ways
of
vacating
or
modifying
a
decree
but
only
the
issuing
court
can
do
so.
never
a
moment
in
time
has
there
been
since
this
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
been
instituted
when
the
agency
was
not
under
temporary
or
permanent
restraint
from
producing
those
documents.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
by
virtue
of
temporary
restraining
order
in
the
delaware
court,
by
virtue
of
a
temporary
injunction
and
by
virtue
of
a
permanent
injunction,
all
in
another
court.
and
yet
the
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
very
common
in
the
reverse
situation.
there
are
many
cases
on
the
books
where
an
agency
has
refused
to
produce
documents
and
a
requester
has
brought
suit
in
some
court
where
the
submitter
has
intervened
to
help
bolster
the
position
of
the
government
and
make
whatever
arguments
it
thought
was
appropriate.
that
has
been
very
common.
the
requesters
would
have
this
court
consider
this
case
as
if
there
had
never
been
any
restraining
order
in
effect,
but
that
is
not
our
case.
and
it
is
equally
significant,
i
submit,
that
the
requesters
in
their
brief
never
take
a
position
whatsoever
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done,
what
ought
to
be
done
with
this
case
now
that
there
is
a
permanent
injunction
in
place,
and
yet
that
is
our
case.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
true
and
i
would
suppose
we
would
have
intervened.
but
in
all
candor,
when
the
decision
is
that
the
agency
will
release
the
documents,
it
is
usually
going
to
be
the
submitter
of
the
documents
that
will
bring
the
suit
first.
and
when
the
decision
is
not
to
release
the
documents,
it
will
be
the
requester
who
will
bring
the
suit
first.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes,
of
course,
and
because
a
party
who
is
going
to
get
what
he
asked
for
really
has
no
cause
of
action
and
that
comes
to
a
second
point
as
to
whether
there
is
a
case
of
controversy.
he
has
no
basis
for
suing
if
the
agency
says
i
am
going
to
give
you
these
documents
tomorrow.
so
we
come
to
the
second
ground,
the
second
quite
independent
ground,
and
that
is
comity.
we
submit
that
sound
principles
of
judicial
administration
really
require
that
deference
be
given
to
a
sister
court
which
has
first
seized
hold
of
a
lawsuit
and
is
in
the
process
of
adjudicating
it.
unfortunately,
we
witness
here
an
almost
deliberate
effort
to
cause
a
collision.
it
is
very
unfortunate,
but
i
must
say
to
cause
duplicative
litigation,
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
preferred
its
own
court,
and
yet
it
is,
as
i
have
said,
quite
natural
for
the
plaintiff
to
select
its
jurisdiction.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
comity
principles
apply,
as
is
the
suggestion
of
the
court
below,
only
when
all
the
parties
in
the
second
suit
are
parties
to
the
first,
but
there
is
no
such
rule
and
we
certainly
urge
that
this
court
not
to
construct
such
a
rule
when
there
is,
justice
rehnquist,
an
opportunity
to
intervene
in
the
delaware
district
court,
if
there
is
a
feeling
that
the
government
will
be
an
adequate
representative.
or
the
respondents
could
have
intervened
here
in
the
third
circuit.
and
when
they
moved
to
appear
as
amicus
on
a
procedural
issue,
we
opposed
their
appearing
on
that
basis
and
said
in
our
same
paper
that
we
would
have
no
objection
even
at
that
late
date
if
they
were
to
intervene
at
the
third
circuit
level.
so
certainly
where
we
do
not
have
a
recalcitrant
agency
in
this
case,
we
do
not
think
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
provides
a
basis
for
relief.
what
we
do
have
here
is
that
the
manufacturers
have
a
strong
statutory
basis
in
1391(e)
for
bringing
a
suit
in
a
locality
where
it
resides,
a
very
strong
government
policy
dating
back
to
1962.
and
with
a
potential
of
200
million
requesters
who
might
request
a
document
at
any
particular
moment,
we
believe
that
comity
should
indicate
that
litigation
in
this
area
ought
to
be
focused
in
a
single
forum.
now,
my
final
argument,
case
or
controversy,
which
i
would
only
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
so
i
may
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
--
judge
ritchey
found
that
since
the
requesters
and
the
government
both
desired
the
same
result,
release
of
the
documents,
that
it
was
no
case
of
controversy
as
to
then.
no
court,
not
even
the
court
below
here,
has
held
that
the
joinder
of
manufacturers
under
rule
19
provides
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
we
are
a
mere
appendage
and
our
being
added
as
an
appendage
did
not
translate
a
non-controversy
into
a
controversy.
thank
you,
sir.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
your
honors,
first
of
all,
in
response
to
some
questions
from
the
justice,
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
improperly
withheld
point
was
fully
briefed
in
the
court
below.
those
briefs
indeed
are
lodged
with
this
court
and
if
there
is
any
question
about
it
or
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
it
was
briefed
more
sketchily
the
first
time
because
we
were
placing
greater
emphasis
on
the
case
of
controversy,
but
it
was
there
by
both
the
government
incidentally
and
by
us.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes,
more
fully
the
second
time.
and
we
frankly
do
not
know
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deal
with
the
point
at
all.
perhaps
some
of
the
discussion
here
today
would
suggest
why
the
point
was
not
dealt
with.
i
might
also
add,
although
it
may
date
me,
justice
rehnquist,
when
you
rely
on
walker
v.
birmingham,
i
would
also
like
to
say
that
in
our
brief
we
point
to
the
united
mine
workers
case
where
john
l.
lewis
made
a
mistake
as
to
whether
an
injunction
was
binding
or
not
and
it
cost
his
union
$1
million.
so
i
would
think
that
injunctions
are
to
be
obeyed
until
such
time
as
they
were
set
aside.
we
are
frankly
at
a
loss,
although
perhaps
it
is
not
important,
as
to
why
the
government
has
changed
its
position
on
case
of
controversy.
part
of
the
difficulty
that
we
get
in
here
is
because
we
really
did
not
have
a
case
of
controversy
in
this
court.
the
government
now
states
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
as
to
the
scope
or
the
effect
of
the
injunction.
but
i
have
not
heard
one
word
on
the
part
of
the
government
or
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
as
to
what
the
controversy
is
about
that
injunction.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
there
still
isn't
one,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
are
in
this
bind
here,
wasting
this
court's
time
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
no,
mr.
justice,
you
need
not
decide
it.
there
are
three
independent
bases
for
deciding
it
and
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
of
course,
that
is
quite
acceptable
to
us.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
think
it's
good
practice
and
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
although
this
court
and
other
courts
upon
occasion
do
avoid
the
jurisdictional
issue,
there
are,
for
example
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well,
this
case
is
now
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
it
is
still
undecided
in
the
district
court
whether
warwick,
one
of
the
twelve
manufacturers,
was
properly
served
with
process.
that
issue
has
not
yet
been
decided
either,
which
is
sometimes
considered
jurisdictional.
thank
you.
