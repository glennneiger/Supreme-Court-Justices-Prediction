justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
geller,
did
the
court
of
appeals
reject
the
argument
that
the
district
court
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
should
be
dismissed
because
there
just
isn't
any
wrongful
withholding?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
presented
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
opinion
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
call
them
chrysler
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
may
be
gone
pretty
soon,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
pretty
general
ground.
i
wondered
why
the
--
you
didn't
petition
independently,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
file
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
government's
position
that
the
court
in
the
--
the
court
handling
the
second
suit,
the
later
suit,
should
hold
its
hand
from
the
very
outset,
or
do
you
say
that
comity
picks
up
when
there
has
been
a
judgment
in
one
court
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
could
have
stayed
its
action.
what
is
your
position,
when
should
it
have
stayed
it,
from
the
very
outset?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
it
have
then
erred
to
go
ahead
until
there
has
been
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
been
error
to
go
ahead,
even
though
predictably
--
let's
assume
the
district
of
columbia
district
court
thought
that
the
docket
in
this
court
is
much
freer,
much
more
--
much
quicker
than
the
court
in
delaware.
couldn't
they
have
proceeded
to
judgment
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
threshold
issue,
the
threshold
issue
on
the
--
i
suppose
is
whether
a
permanent
injunction
ought
to
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
feel
you
must
interpose
that,
the
injunction,
to
answer
my
question?
suppose
no
temporary
restraining
order,
preliminary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
one
court
or
the
other
had
come
to
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
we
don't
need
to
settle
that,
because
there
is
a
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
district
of
columbia
--
so
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
done
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
have
been
all
right
for
them
to
just
say
we
are
going
to
wait?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
comity?
what
is
the
bottom
line
on
the
comity
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
to
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
to
wait
to
see
if
the
other
case
really
stands
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibility?
what
else
could
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you,
but
what
if
it
was
over-turned?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
reverse
--
if
you
affirm
the
district
court,
it
is
a
dismissal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the
bottom
line
on
the
comity
case.
you
would
just
sit
and
wait.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
usually
a
reason
for
venuing
a
case,
though,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
made.
apparently
you
recognize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
petition
for
rehearing
for
this
last
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
it
barely
raised,
this
time
or
the
time
before?
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
realize
this
was
a
jurisdictional
argument.
i
thought
you
just
lose
on
the
merits
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
adjudicates
your
case
that
you
file
and
say
you
lose,
there
isn't
any
improper
withholding.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
agency
says
i'm
withholding
the
documents
because
i
have
been
ordered
to
or
i
will
be
held
in
contempt
if
i
don't,
they
nevertheless
are
wrongfully
withholding?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
second
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
disagreeing
with
the
other
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
point
where
we
are
now,
is
there
is
a
court
of
appeals
judgment
and
cert
is
pending
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
as
far
as
the
fact
that
the
agency
would
not
be
violating
foia
because
it
is
not
wrongfully
withholding,
the
injunction
has
been
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile
the
agency
would
not
be
wrongfully
withholding.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
true
without
a
permanent
injunction.
i
mean
that
is
after
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
times
or
the
first
time
or
the
second
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
more
fully
the
second
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
there
still
isn't
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
is
a
threshold
issue
that
you
urge
and
that
we
must
decide
at
the
doorstep
because
that
question
is
always
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
don't
we
have
to
decide
that
before
we
can
reach
anything
else?
we
just
can't
assume
jurisdiction
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
isn't
that
inevitable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
raised
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
assume
we
have
jurisdiction
and
therefore
we
decide
the
merits?
