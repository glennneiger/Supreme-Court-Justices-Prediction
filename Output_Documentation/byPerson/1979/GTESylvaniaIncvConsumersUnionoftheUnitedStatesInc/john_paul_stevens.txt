justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
is
that
true
as
to
both
of
the
opinions
of
the
d.c.
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
presented
both
times,
i
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
there
are
going
to
be
any
more
reverse
foia
actions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
chrysler,
which
said
there
were
no
such
thing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
as
a
shorthand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
i
don't
see
how
that
case
could
arise,
because
if
there
is
no
injunction,
presumably
if
mr.
shniderman's
argument
is
correct,
anyway,
you
would
have
simply
turned
the
documents
over,
notwithstanding
the
pendency
of
the
delaware
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
had
been
no
injunction
before
may
first,
should
we
not
assume
that
you
would
have
done
what
you
said
you
were
going
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
hypothetical
couldn't
arise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
justice
white's
question
was,
assuming
just
the
pending
case
and
no
order,
and
my
understanding
of
the
government's
position
on
all
along
has
been,
if
there
were
no
order,
we
would
have
turned
the
documents
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
there's
a
case
in
controversy
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morrison,
i
trust
before
you
are
through
you
will
explain
your
views
about
the
improperly
withheld
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morrison,
don't
forget
to
answer
my
question
about
improper
withholding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you're
trying,
but
it
is
really
terribly
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
how
it
got
here
or
the
equities
or
all
the
rest
of
it,
we
really
have
to
address
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
what
about
the
argument,
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
figure
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
any
time
during
this
case,
could
they,
were
they
wrongfully
withholding
documents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
no
procedures
for
transferring
a
case
from
one
court
of
appeals
to
another,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
mr.
morrison.
they
also
had
to
get
the
injunction.
they
could
have
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
a
position
that
a
wrongful
withholding
occurs
when
an
agency
says
we
need
time
to
evaluate
your
request?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
wrongful
withholding
unless
they
send
you
the
documents
by
return
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
reverse
be
true,
mr.
morrison,
you
could
have
multiple
requesters
all
over
the
country
and
not
be
able
to
consolidate
them
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morrison,
it
may
be
that
the
tro
is
automatic,
but
you
don't
suggest
that
district
judges
around
the
united
states,
when
the
government
argues
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
the
submitters
to
get
an
injunction,
that
they
automatically
enter
injunctions
right
and
left,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
must
at
least
be
a
legal
basis
for
the
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
shouldn't
we
presume
that
all
judges
are
equally
competent
to
weigh
the
merits
of
these
claims,
all
federal
district
judges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
really
if
there
is
a
colorable
legal
basis,
it
persuades
the
district
judge
that
the
documents
should
not
be
released,
they
shouldn't
be
pell-mell
released
just
to
protect
the
forum
of
the
other
side?
