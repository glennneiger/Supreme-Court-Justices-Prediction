justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shniderman,
since
so
much
of
this
case
seems
to
depend
on
procedural
history
and
so
forth,
was
the
theory
of
your
case
in
delaware
solely
a
reverse
foia
case
or
was
it
partly
a
chrysler-type
case
that
there
was
some
protection
given
to
providers
that
couldn't
be
furnished
regardless
of
whether
an
agency
wanted
to
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
such
thing
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
would
have
to
say,
i
suppose,
that
the
requesters
had
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
delaware
action
and
to
appeal
the
injunction
against
disclosure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
if
we
were
to
lay
down
a
general
legal
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
position,
you
would
almost
have
to
take
the
opposite
position
if
they
had
first
filed
an
action
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
before
your
clients
had
filed
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
disclosure,
wouldn't
you,
if
you
rely
on
comity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
agencies
have
set
up
internal
procedures
whereby
they
notify
in
advance,
don't
they,
at
least
that
was
true
in
chrysler,
that
the
secretary
of
defense
notify
chrysler
ten
days
in
advance
that
he
is
going
to
release
them
in
case
chrysler
wanted
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
mean
is
action
based
on
some
statute
which
forbids
an
agency
to
whom
information
has
been
furnished
by
a
private
person
from
disclosing
it
to
someone
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
concede
that
there
are
eleven
courts
of
appeals
in
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
under
walker
v.
birmingham,
it
is
not
being
improperly
withheld,
even
though
the
injunction
is
erroneous,
because
the
remedy
is
to
appeal
the
injunction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
virtue
of
the
joinder
under
rule
19?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
case
from
this
court
ever
holding
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
saying
that
foia
is
so
broad
and
congress
didn't
intend
to
strip
a
court
of
its
equitable
powers,
and
yet
i
understood
a
moment
ago
that
you
agreed
that
under
walker
v.
birmingham
the
only
way
to
challenge
an
injunction
was
to
appeal
it,
not
to
disobey
it.
are
you
saying
that
applies
only
to
an
injunction
issued
only
four
days
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
district
court
in
which
you
apply
your
new
tactics
if
you
lose
this
case
says
the
agency
says
it
is
going
to
give
you
the
records,
you
say
you
want
them,
what
are
you
arguing
about?
you
don't
have
a
case
of
controversy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
ones
which
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
those
statutory
time
frames
have
not
passed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
few
of
them
that
there
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
prefer
the
forum
in
which
the
government
agency
is
located
to
the
forum
in
which
either
the
submitter
or
the
requesters
are
located?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
are
going
to
create
a
whole
new
branch
of
law,
depending
on
case
by
case
situations
as
to
whether
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
can't
decide
anything
else
if
we
decide
there
is
not
a
case
of
controversy.
