didn't
you,
just
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
that
freudian
moving
in
on
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
you
are
trying
to
do.
aren't
you,
relitigate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
to
the
third
circuit
case
that
is
on
appeal
here,
on
cert
here?
what
would
happen
to
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
to
that
case?
could
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
reverse
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
you
do
that
on
this
case
if
you
have
it
all
settled?
if
you
don't
need
us
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
bring
in
hawaii
while
you
are
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
could
stop
the
forum
shopping,
couldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
answer
is
yes,
but
you
would
rather
have
us
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
delaware.
that's
strange.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
california
isn't
involved
in
this.
you
just
object
to
taking
a
trip
to
delaware.
justice
thurgood
marshall
neither
of
you
like
amtrak.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
information
may
be
obtained
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
when
the
agency
holding
the
material
has
been
enjoined
from
disclosing
it
by
federal
district
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
an
agency
enjoined
from
disclosing
information
by
a
federal
district
court
has
not
"improperly"
withheld
that
material
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
in
an
investigation
of
hazards
in
the
operation
of
televisions,
respondent,
consumer
product
safety
commission
obtained
accident
reports
from
various
manufacturers
including
petitioners.
the
respondent,
consumers
union
of
the
united
states
and
public
citizen's
health
research
group
requested
disclosure
of
the
reports
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
cpsc
decided
to
release
the
reports
and
petitioner
filed
since
in
various
federal
district
courts
to
enjoin
the
disclosure.
those
suits
were
consolidated
in
the
district
of
delaware
and
that
court
issued
temporary
restraining
orders,
a
preliminary
injunction
and
a
permanent
injunction
to
bar
disclosure.
after
these
suits
have
been
filed,
the
requesters
filed
the
instant
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
against
cpsc
and
the
petitioners.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
concluding
that
there
was
no
article
3
case
or
controversy
since
the
agency
agreed
with
the
requesters
that
the
material
should
be
disclosed.
ultimately,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
there
was
a
case
of
controversy
and
that
the
injunction
handed
in
delaware
did
not
foreclose
the
request
to
sue.
there
is
an
article
3
case
of
converse
between
the
requesters
and
the
cpsc.
the
parties
clearly
disagree
under
the
effect
of
the
delaware
injunction
on
the
rights
of
the
requesters
to
obtain
the
reports
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
this
conflict
satisfies
the
requirement
of
article
3.
the
requesters
may
not
obtain
documents
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
when
that
agency
possessing
the
documents
had
been
enjoined.
the
foia
gives
district
courts
jurisdiction
to
order
the
production
of
improperly
without
agency
records
but
the
withholding
is
not
improper
when
the
cpsc
is
obeying
an
injunction
issued
by
a
court
with
jurisdiction.
since
the
material
was
not
improperly
withheld
by
the
cpsc
within
the
meaning
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
thereby
reversed.
