mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
of
statutory
construction
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
section
357
permits
the
condemnation
of
allotted
indian
lands
by
seizure
or,
put
another
way,
whether
would
be
condemnors
are
required
to
file
a
judicial
condemnation
proceeding.
the
second
is
whether
highway
rights
of
way
across
indian-allotted
lands
can
be
obtained
by
condemnation
at
all
or,
rather,
as
tabbytite
contends,
whether
the
statutes
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
grant
rights
of
way
over
allotted
indian
lands,
subject
to
his
conditions
and
requirements,
is
the
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
the
right
of
way.
now,
briefly,
a
textual
argument
with
regard
to
the
first
issue.
the
statute
says
that
allotted
indian
lands
“may
be
condemned.”
it
does
not
say
“may
be
seized.”
it
does
not
say
“may
be
taken.”
it
doesn't
even
say
“may
be
acquired.”
now,
when
land
has
been
seized,
we
don't
say
it's
been
taken
--
we
do
say
it's
been
taken,
we
don't
say
it's
been
condemned.
condemnation
requires
one
of
two
things,
either
a
judicial
proceeding
initiated
by
the
condemnor
or
a
land
owner's
suit
for
just
compensation
which
has
come
to
be
known
as
an
inverse
condemnation
suit.
now,
that,
i
should
say,
there's
no
indication
that
the
term
“inverse
condemnation”
had
been
used
at
all
in
1901
when
section
357
was
enacted.
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
land
owner's
suit
for
just
compensation
is
the
land
owner's
remedy
and
the
condemnation
cannot
occur
without
either
one
of
those
two
preconditions,
either
the
land
owner
suit
or
the
suit
by
the
governmental
authority.
and,
in
this
case,
neither
of
those
things
has
occurred,
so
that
neither
condition
precedent
is
present.
therefore,
the
lands
have
not
been
condemned
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
your
honor,
our
position
on
that
is
that
seizure
--
a
blatant
seizure
of
property
without
notice
or
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
violates
due
process.
inverse
condemnation,
again,
is
a
land
owner's
remedy
and,
in
a
sense,
when
a
land
owner
sues
for
compensation,
he
is
acknowledging
his
notice.
he
is,
himself,
pursuing
his
suit
in
a
forum
of
competent
jurisdiction.
so,
in
a
sense,
the
procedural
due
process
issues
on
--
do
not
arise
in
an
inverse
condemnation
setting,
but
seizures
--
there
is
--
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
advertent
and
inadvertent
seizures.
on
many
cases,
most
of
the
so-called
inverse
condemnation
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
involved
situations
where
there's
a
good
faith
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
land
owner
about
whether
fifth
amendment-protected
property
rights
have
actually
been
invaded.
a
classic
example
of
that
would
be
the
crosby
case
involving
whether
an
invasion
of
air
rights
constituted
a
violation
of
a
compensable
property
interest.
of
course,
the
court
held
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
but,
our
position
is
certainly
that
section
357
should
be
construed
to
--
in
compliance
with
procedural
due
process
requirements
and,
certainly,
state
and
local
authorities
proceeding
under
section
357
should
be
required
to
do
what
they
should
be
doing
in
any
event,
namely,
to
provide
opportunity
and
a
notice
to
be
heard
to
property
owners
whose
rights
stand
to
be
invaded,
just
like
they
were
required
to
do
before
terminating
welfare
benefits,
before
garnishing
wages,
before
suspending
driver's
licenses.
indeed,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
compensable
property
rights
are
entitled
to
any
less
procedural
process
protection
than
our
--
other
kinds
of
lesser
property
interests.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
correct.
now,
the
procedural
due
process
aspects
of
the
case
are
further
highlighted
by
the
declaration
of
takings
laws
in
both
federal
and
state
laws,
providing
very
meticulous
procedures
and,
indeed,
a
court
order
before
possession
can
be
transferred
prior
to
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
and,
indeed,
if
seizures
are
permitted,
these
declarations
of
takings
statutes
are
rendered
completely
superfluous.
alaska
statutes
in
that
regard
are
especially
meticulous
in
protecting
the
rights
of
affected
property
owners.
now,
aside
from
general
procedural
due
process,
the
court
--
this
court
has
been
especially
vigilant
in
assuring
special
fairness
to
indians.
for
example,
in
1978,
the
--
this
court
decided
in
santa
clara
pueblo
against
martinez
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
have
created
and
employ
cause
of
action
by
tribal
officials
against
tribal
officials
because
tribal
officials
had
not
had
a
prior
opportunity
to
present
their
views
to
the
congress
in
the
consideration
of
the
1968
indian
civil
rights
act.
the
court
relied
on
“the
overriding
duty
of
our
federal
government
to
deal
fairly
with
indians.”
similarly,
in
the
1974
decision,
morton
against
ruiz,
needy
indians
who
were
living
near
but
off-indian
reservations
were
held
not
to
be
able
to
be
denied
welfare
benefits
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
by
an
unpublished
ad
hoc
agency
determination.
the
court
held
that
their
denial
of
assistance
under
these
circumstances
“is
inconsistent
with
the
distinctive
obligation
of
trust
incumbent
upon
the
government
in
its
dealings
with
these
dependent
and,
sometimes,
exploited
people.”
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
--
primarily,
there
was
that
aspect
of
the
decision,
but
the
court
also
held
that,
even
if
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
the
authority
by
congress
to
reduce
welfare
benefits
or
even
to
eliminate
them
to
off-reservation
indians,
they
haven't
done
it
in
a
proper
way
in
this
case.
so,
it
is
even
more
difficult
to
ascribe
to
congress
an
intent
to
allow
indian
lands
to
be
taken
by
seizure,
a
procedure,
incidentally,
that
the
ninth
circuit
itself,
in
another
case
and
not
an
indian
case,
described
as
“high-handed
government
conduct
and
not
to
be
favored.”
now,
the
second
issue
that's
presented
by
tabbytite
was
left
open
in
this
court's
decision
40
years
ago
in
minnesota
against
the
united
states.
at
that
time,
solicitor
general
jackson
argued
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
that
highway
rights
of
way
across
allotted
lands
could
not
be
obtained
by
condemnation
at
all,
but
rather
require
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
pursuant
to
25
u.s.c.,
section
311
which,
incidentally,
was
part
of
the
same
statute
that
also
included
section
357,
the
1901
indian
appropriations
act.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit,
though,
has
a
controlling
precedent
on
point
which
is
contrary
to
our
position.
so,
even
if
it
were,
it's
doubtful
that
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
reconsidered
that
decision.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i'm
not
sure
why
it
wasn't
raised,
your
honor.
i
wasn't
involved
in
the
case
at
that
time.
i
would,
however,
join
mr.
dalton's
remarks
that
to
decide
this
case
solely
on
the
ground
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
sending
it
back
and
requiring
the
municipality
to,
then,
file
a
condemnation
action
on
which,
then,
mrs.
tabbytite
would
defend
on
the
grounds
that
the
right
of
way
can't
be
acquired
by
condemnation
would
prolong
this
already
decade-long
litigation
which
has
already
been
twice
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
they're
not
really
the
same
thing,
particularly
in
the
context
of
--
when
you
consider
12
million
acres
of
allotted
indian
land
scattered
across
the
country
to
say
that
the
land
has
been
condemned
through
seizure
without
notice
or
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
is
a
--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
except
that
the
decision
make
up
would
be
completely
different.
if
the--
if
anchorage
was
required
to
apply
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
a
right
of
way,
then
it
would
not
--
anchorage
would
not
have
the
power
of
condemnation
under
that
statute.
it's
within
the
secretary's
discretion
and
he
could
impose
conditions
that
are
favorable
to
the
interest
of
the
indian
allottee.
it
would
be
a
very
different
kind
of
a
resolution
than
the
one
that
was
affected
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
now,
in
fact,
the
kinds
of
problems
that
have
arisen
in
this
case
would
not
have
come
up
at
all
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
the
exclusive
power
to
authorize
the
use
of
indian-allotted
lands
for
highway
rights
of
way.
and,
indeed,
those
matters
would
be
considered
administratively
by
the
interior
department,
rather
than
in
the
federal
courts.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
tabbytite's
position
on
the
second
statutory
argument
is
supported
by
all
of
the
applicable
canons
of
construction.
the
1901
indian
appropriations
act
is
ambiguous
on
its
face
because
it
has
these
two
sections,
arguably,
which
one
applies
to
the
acquisition
or
which
one
or
both
of
them
apply
to
the
acquisition
of
rights
of
way
across
allotted
lands.
well,
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
indians
and
the
specific
statute
should
take
hold
of
the
general
one
and
the
statute
should
not
be
rendered
insignificant
or
superfluous.
thank
you.
