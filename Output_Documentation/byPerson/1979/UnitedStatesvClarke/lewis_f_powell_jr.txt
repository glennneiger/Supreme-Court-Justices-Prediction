may
we
come
back
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
to
a
question
that
was
put
to
you
a
little
earlier?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
that
the
municipality
wanted
to
acquire
either
right
of
way
or
title
to
land
override.
forget
all
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
city
council
says
“we
need
the
land”
and
they
consult
the
city
attorney
and
he
says
the
quickest
way
to
get
it
is
to
proceed
under
357,
exercising
what
you
describe
as
a
de
facto
right.
now
suppose
the
city
simply
goes
out
with
a
bulldozer
and
knocks
down
a
building
or
two,
giving
no
notice
to
anybody,
purporting
to
exercise
their
right
under
357
that
i
understand
you
are
setting
here
today,
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
your
case
entirely
dependent
on
the
facts
that
would
enable
you
to
argue
as
you
are
arguing,
perhaps
correctly,
that
the
city
was
ignorant
of
the
situation
and
did
not
understand
that
the
proper
procedure
required
that
it
go
through
judicial
condemnation?
well,
putting
it
differently,
are
you
saying
that
this
statute
conveys
a
right
knowingly
to
condemn
property
by
force
without
resort
to
judicial
proceedings?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
i'm
just
testing
your
theory
that
357
authorizes
both
de
facto
and
judicial
condemnation.
