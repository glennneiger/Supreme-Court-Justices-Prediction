mr.
dalton,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
say
that
inverse
condemnation
is,
perhaps,
synonymous
with
de
facto
condemnation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
have
to
be
inadvertent?
there's
nothing
inadvertent
about
this,
was
there?
they
knew
the
road
was
going
over
some
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we'll
let
you
pick
it
up
in
the

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
united
states
against
clarke.
mr.
dalton,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief

but,
absent
an
action,
there
is
no
fixed
price
until
there
is
an
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
in
this
case,
no
price
can
be
fixed,
from
your
point
of
view,
until
they
commenced
an
action
--
a
true
action
and
not
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
this
called
inverse
condemnation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
a
governmental
agency
having
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
without
commencing
any
proceeding,
moves
in
and
takes
over
a
building
and
either
removes
the
occupants
or
occupies
a
building
that's
not
occupied,
are
they
--
in
your
point
of
view,
are
they
no
different
from
any
other
squatter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
they
being
clothed
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
to
you,
means
that
they
must
exercise
it
in
a
traditional
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dalton.
mr.
pelcyger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
sh
--
i
suppose
a
threshold
issue
in
any
formal
condemnation
proceeding
is
whether
the
condemnor,
in
law,
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
is
that
not
a
threshold
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
would
be
your
first
question
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weinig.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
united
states
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
government
has
told
us
that
there
are
12
million
acres
of
land
in
this
particular
category.
i
suppose
you'd
agree
that
the
real
parties
in
interest
are
not
likely
to
know
what's
going
on
in
all
of
those
12
million
acres,
nor
is
any
indian
agent.
is
that
reasonably
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
suppose
it's
six
million
or
two
million.
that's
a
lot
of
acres,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
notice
function
just
fundamental
in
due
process
to
al
--
to
let
a
property
owner
or
a
claimant
to
property
know
that
someone
is
taking
or
about
to
take?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
last
cite?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
mentioned
that
one
alternative
date
for
fixing
compensation
was
the
date
of
payment,
did
you
mean
payment
or
tender?
suppose
you
had
a
tender
by
the
municipality
or
the
condemning
authority
and
it
was
rejected,
and
the
payment
was
made
a
year
later.
it
--
tender
would
be
the
more
accurate
or
the
more
equitable
date,
would
it
not?
chief
justice

e.

of
the
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you.
i
believe
the
time
is
all
consumed.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against

be
announced
