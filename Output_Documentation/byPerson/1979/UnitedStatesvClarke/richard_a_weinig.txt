mr.
richard
a.
weinig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
eminent
domain.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
to
construe
a
simple
unambiguous
statute,
25
u.s.c.,
section
357.
it
reads,
“the
lands
allotted
in
severalty
to
indians
may
be
condemned
for
any
public
purpose
under
the
laws
of
the
state
or
territory
where
located
in
the
same
manner
as
land
owned
in
fee
may
be
condemned
and
the
money
awarded
as
damages
shall
be
paid
to
the
allottee.”
the
issue
of
state
law
concerning
what
constitutes
condemnation,
substance,
and
procedure
are
rendered
applicable
in
this
st
--
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
language
of
section
357.
section
357
is
both
a
substantive
and
procedural
statute
concerning
the
law
of
eminent
domain
and
is
to
be
governed
by
the
law
of
the
state.
the
specific
issues
before
us
involve
a
sub-specie
of
condemnation
or
its
synonym,
eminent
domain,
which
is
called
inverse
condemnation
or
de
facto
condemnation.
inverse
condemnation,
which
is
identical
with
de
facto
condemnation,
is
a
taking
of
private
property
authorized
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
for
public
purpose
without
the
prior
filing
of
formal
judicial
eminent
domain
proceedings
and
requires
subsequent
payment
and
just
compensation.
the
specific
task
before
this
court,
in
construing
section
357,
is
to
determine
whether
it
allows
condemnation
of
lands
allotted
in
severalty
to
indians
to
be
taken
through
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
condemnation
or
de
facto
condemnation
if
the
laws
of
the
state
applicable,
allow
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
condemnation
or
de
facto
condemnation,
as
well
as
by
formal
eminent
domain
proceedings.
now,
the
united
states
has
attempted
to
categorize
this
case
as
a
feud
between
two
homesteaders
on
a
remote
mountain
top
in
frozen
alaska
with
the
issue
being
whether
one
could
obtain
the
right
to
trespass
across
the
lands
of
another.
this
is
not
so.
it
is
misleading.
the
issue
is
whether
a
roadway
used
as
a
public
roadway,
wholly
within
city
boundaries,
and
maintained
as
the
principal
street
of
the
city
between
1961
and
1975,
and
by
the
municipality
of
anchorage,
a
home
rule
of
municipality
created
in
september
of
1975,
constitutes
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
eminent
domain
of
inverse
condemnation,
a
de
facto
condemnation
for
a
public,
not
private
road.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes,
it
would
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
the
facts
are
not
terribly
important,
except
in
the
sense
that
the
laws
of
the
state
of
alaska,
since
the
crosby
case
was
decided
in
197--
1966,
have
a
continuous
train
of
cases
from
their
city
of
anchorage
versus
nesbett
and
the
wickwire
case
have
recognized
that
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
condemnation
is
equally
valid
to
a
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding
as
long
as
just
compensation
is
paid
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
it
certainly
could,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
it
is.
it
is
up
on
the
hillside.
it
is
one
of
the
more
desirable
subdivisions
and
residential
areas
of
anchorage.
it
is
situated
at
about
2,000-foot
level
in
the
chugach
mountain
area,
an
area
that's
fre
--
very
rapidly
developing.
it
is
an
area,
for
instance,
that
has
probably
the
finest
view
of
any
subdivision
of
anchorage,
but
it
is
in
the
hilltop
area.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
has
not
ruled
upon
issues
specifically,
but
i
think
that
if
a
government
entity
knew
in
advance
that
it
were
to
bring
eminent
domain
proceedings,
it
would
be
proper
for
it
to
file
a
complaint,
not
necessarily
with
a
declaration
of
taking
because
that
is
discretionary
with
the
public
agency.
but
i
think
there'd
been
--
the
facts
of
this
case
are
critically
important
because
the
city
--
the
municipality
of
anchorage
did
not
exist
during
the
time
of
the
transgressions
which
have
been
outlined
by
the
united
states
and
mrs.
tabbytite.
it
was
not
created
until
september
of
1975
and
i
would
like
to
review
the
facts
of
this
case
for
you
because
i
think
they're
critical
to
an
understanding
of
it.
and,
i
think
the
first
thing
to
examine
in
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
surely,
sir,
you
can.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
normally,
it
would,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
if
a
deliberate
act
were
made
to
go
out
and
file
a
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding,
it
would
have
to
be
described.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
well,
i
would,
first,
answer
that
the
allegation
of
the
12
million
acres
is
not
of
record
in
this
case.
i
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
right.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
the
notice
function
is
integral
to
due
process.
however,
in
the
cases
of
inverse
condemnation
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court,
the
notice
function
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
constitutional
deficiency
to
the
taking.
for
instance,
take
the
united
states
versus
crosby
case,
the
over
flight
cases,
the
griggs
case.
the
over
flights,
of
course,
were
direct
intentional
actions
on
the
part
of
the
particular
agency,
but
there
was
no
finding
by
this
court
in
either
case
that
the
lack
of
notice
was
a
jurisdictional
or
constitutional
infirmity
here.
now,
i
think
that
the
same
situation
would
apply
with
regard
to
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
de
facto
or
inverse
condemnation
with
regard
to
the
indian
lands,
but
if
a
party
knew
in
advance
that
this
government
entity
were
going
to
go
out
and
condemn
land,
the
notice,
i
think,
would
be
essential.
but,
the
fact
in
this
case
is
that
when
anchorage
began
maintenance
of
this
road
in
1975,
in
september
of
1975,
there
was
notice
to
both
the
united
states
and
tabbytite
that
this
action
was
being
taken.
now,
the
history
of
the
litigation
is
critical
to
this.
as
i've
mentioned
previously,
before
september
of
1975,
the
history
of
local
government
is
critical
to
this
case.
before
september
of
1975,
the
regional
government
in
the
area
was
the
borough,
and
there
were
a
number
of
cities
therein
anchorage
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
we
--
since
anchorage
--
the
answer,
directly,
is
no,
except
for
trespass
damages
which,
i
believe,
were
paid
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
1973.
we
have
been
willing
to
adjudicate
the
issue
of
just
compensation
in
this
case
since
1976.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
because
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
excuse
me,
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
richard

because
--
mr.
richard

we

mr.

not
in
the

sir.
mr.
richard

there
are
two
reasons.
mr.
richard
a.

no.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
no.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
alright,
there
[laughter]
--
as
i
indicated,
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
did
not
condemn
immediately
after
the
ninth
circuit
decision
came
down
in
february
of
1976.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
alright.
let's
take
it
from
the
beginning
of
time,
in
september
of
1976,
when
the
municipality,
a
newly
created
government
began
maintenance
of
the
road.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
final
judgment
by
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
binding
upon
the
municipality
as
successor
to
glen
alps,
binding
upon
the
united
states,
and
binding
upon
tabbytite
at
that
time
that
the
road
was
a
public
road
right
of
way
through
an
easement
of
necessity.
for
the
next
five
months,
the
municipality
maintained
that
road,
snow-plowing
it
through
the
rigorous
of
alaskan
winter
pursuant
to
a
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
alaska.
after
the
ninth
circuit
rendered
its
decision
in
february
of
1976,
as
soon
as
the
file
was
returned
from
the
ninth
circuit
in
san
francisco
to
anchorage
so
that
the
new
party,
the
municipality,
could
examine
what
the
prior
course
of
litigation
was,
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
determine
whether,
as
a
consequence
of
the
actions,
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
had
occurred.
after
the
district
court
judge
in
s
--
in
november
of
1976
ruled
that
it
did
not
because
the
former
city
of
glen
alps
did
not
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain
but
invited
us
to
re-file
a
motion,
determining
whether
the
new
status
of
law
of
the
municipality,
which
clearly
granted
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
would
be
there.
the
municipal
assembly,
in
december
of
1976,
held
a
public
hearing
tha
--
upon
the
issue
of
whether
a
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding
should
be
instigated
on
that
road.
at
that
public
hearing
and
the
transcripts
can
be
available
to
this
court
if
you
wish
them,
mrs.
tabbytite,
the
indian,
and
her
attorney
appeared
and
spoke
with
great
earnestness
and
great
fervor
requesting
the
municipality
not
to
file
formal
eminent
domain
proceedings
upon
this
road.
pending
further
negotiations
of
the
parties
and
pending
further
outcome
of
the
litigation,
which
was
then
in
process,
pursuant
to
the
request
of
the
district
court
or
an
invitation
to
re-file
a
motion
determining
whether
the
issue
of
inverse
condemnation
had
been
changed
because
a
new
government
entity
was
involved.
pursuant
to
the
district
court's
invitation
in
november
of
1976
and
pursuant
to
the
request
of
tabbytite
before
the
municipal
assembly
not
to
file
a
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding,
we
filed
a
su
--
motion
for
summary
judgment,
determining
the
issue
of
inverse
condemnation.
in
april
of
1977,
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
ruled
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
file
a
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding
because
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
condemnation
had
taken
place.
this
was
appealed
by
the
united
states
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
january
of
1979
that
an
inverse
taking
had
occurred.
now,
throughout
all
this
time
period,
the
position
of
the
municipality
has
been,
and
this
can
be
documented
by
the
record
and
i
have
cited
to
the
record
in
my
brief
that,
at
any
time,
we
were
willing
to
adjudicate
the
issue
of
just
compensation
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
this
is
not
of
record,
but
i
will
answer
your
question.
the
answer
is
--
mr.
richard

well,
it's
--
mr.
richard

it
was
in

with
the

attorney
of
anchorage
--
mr.

i
would
think
that
the

until
just
compensation
is
paid
in
this
case,
the

would
rest
in
the

as
trustee.

and
inverse
condemnation
are
the

we're
willing

at
this
case
at
any
time
in
which
the
united

mr.

there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
but
there
is
plenty
of
contemporary
interpretation
of
contemporary
statutes
which
allowed
what
is
now
known
as
inverse
for
statutes
using
the
words
“condemnation”
as
section
357
does,
or
condemnation
under
judicial
process
as
section
7
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
does
which
was
passed
by
the
same
congress
that
enacted
19
--
section
357.
both
of
--
the
most
persuasive
evidence
of
contemporary
usage
in
absence
of
any
legislative
history
is
section
7
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
cited
in
my
brief,
i
believe,
pages
32
and
33.
that
statute
enacted
by
the
same
congress
that
enacted
section
357
in
1901
allowed
condemnation
under
judicial
process.
this
phrase
was
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
versus
buffalo
pitts
company
in
1914
to
allow
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
seizure
or
is
now
known
as
inverse
condemnation.
this
statute
was
further
interpreted
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
state
versus
rank,
1961,
affirmed
by
this
court
in
dugan
versus
rank
in
1963,
to
allow
language
in
a
statute
condemned
under
judicial
process
that
is
more
restrictive
than
the
word
“condemnation”
under
our
statute
to
allow
what
is,
in
essence,
a
taking
in
the
nature
of
inverse
condemnation.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
it
--
the
other
statute
was
enacted
by
the
same
congress
one
year
after
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes,
it
was,
but
the
primary
interpretation
of
section
7
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
was
in
1914
and
that's
highly
contemporary.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
i
think
that
the
consequences
would
be
in
that
case,
that
it
would
not
be
a
valid
condemnation
under
section
357
and
for
this
reason
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
good
faith,
i
believe,
on
the
part
of
the
condemnor
in
exercising
its
powers
of
eminent
domain.
in
the
case
that
you
raise,
i
think
that
good
faith
would
not
be
present,
but
that
is
not
the
case
before
us
with
the
municipality
of
anchorage.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
no,
it
does
--
i
would
not
think
that
it
conveys
a
right
to
go
out
and
condemn
property
by
force,
but
again,
that
is
not
the
situation
in
our
case.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
no
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
theories
concerning
inverse
condemnation
or
de
facto
condemnation
that
have
been
evolved
over
the
years
would
allow
a
taking
by
brute
force
premeditated
in
that
regard,
but
there
are
of
course
any
number
of
instances,
for
instance,
in
which
the
united
states
government
has
gone
out
and
taken
land.
you
have
the
edel
case,
the
dickinson
case
that
whole
string
of
cases
where
the
united
states
has
gone
unto
someone's
land
and
taken
it,
probably
with
the
premeditation
of
the
individual
officer
involved,
but
i
can
only
emphasize
that
that
is
not
the
case
in
our
situation.
we
began
maintenance
of
the
road
under
a
binding
decision
of
the
district
court
and
we
have
been
engaged
in
good
faith
litigation
as
to
its
status
ever
since.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
there
is
a
great
deal
of
alaska
law
about
inverse
condemnation.
the
leading
cases
that
are
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
they
do
not
say
that
you
may
go
out
and
rally
the
tanks
and
move
on
to
somebody's
property
sir,
but
let's
take
a
look
at
the
two
leading
cases
that
have
been
involved
in
the
alaska
supreme
court
on
inverse
condemnation.
the
crosby
case
is
a
prime
example.
the
state
of
alaska
built
a
road
across
somebody's
property
and
they
did
so
under
mistaken
fact.
they
thought
it
was
a
section
line
right
of
way
and
it,
in
fact,
wasn't.
and,
the
state
supreme
court
of
course
found
that
the
road
was
there.
the
road
had
been
built.
the
road
had,
in
fact,
been
placed
there
under
good
faith
under
a
mistake,
very
similar
to
the
mistake,
i
believe,
in
municipality
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
that
is
absolutely
right
sir.
now,
i
think
it's
important
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
i
was
suggesting
that,
in
this
case,
nothing
like
that
is
here
and,
this
is
why
it
is
very
important.
in
light
of
the
presentation
of
tabbytite
and
of
the
united
states
to
bear
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
status
of
the
municipality
language
and
the
former
city
of
glen
alps,
the
homesteaders
on
the
mountain,
everything
else
because
we
weren't
--
we
did
not
exist
at
the
time
that
such
transgressions,
if
transgressions
they
were,
occurred.
i
am
suggesting
that
since
the
municipality
was
created
and
it
is
the
responsible
body
here
today,
that
mrs.
tabbytite
has
been
afforded
every
due
process
required
by
both
the
constitution
and
the
state
of
alaska
eminent
domain
laws.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
i
say
that
there
is
--
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
constitutional
prohibition
and
i
say
that,
in
this
case,
section
357
allows
condemnation
under
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
property
is
located.
yes,
i
think
it
is
authorized
by
statute
in
this
circumstance.
i
see
no
denial
of
due
process
or
constitutional
impediment
by
the
municipality
of
anchorage.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
well,
the
answer
to
the
question,
no,
unorganized
municipalities
may
not.
glen
alps
was
not
an
unorganized
municipality.
it
was
organized
pursuant
to
court
order
as
a
third-class
city
in
1961.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
if
glen
alps
were
the
only
party
involved
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
november
of
1976
that
would
be
correct,
but
let
–
my
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
if
the
municipality
did
not
exist?
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
can
i
refer
very
briefly
to
the
trial
of
this
case
in
which
eminent
domain
was
in
issue
in
june
of
1972?
eminent
domain
had
been
posed
as
an
issue
by
the
city
of
glen
alps.
there
was
hearing
on
the
issue
of
necessity
placed
on
the
road,
and
the
expert
testimony
is
summarized
in
my
brief.
the
issue
of
authority
by
virtue
of
the
glen
alps
counterclaim
was
before
the
court
at
that
time
in
june
of
1972,
but
because
the
court
found
an
alternative
theory
of
law
upon
which
to
make
its
decision
that
the
road
was
public,
an
easement
of
necessity.
it
dismissed
the
glen
alps
counterclaim
as
moot
and
refused
to
rule
upon
the
issues
that
would
otherwise
have
been
presented
if
it
had
chosen
an
eminent
domain
theory
upon
which
to
rely.
it
may
well
have
chosen
the
same
decision
in
june
of
1972
that
it
did
in
november
of
1976
that
glen
alps
did
not
have
that
power,
but
it
should
not
be
thought
by
this
court
that
these
issues
were
not
before
the
trial
court
in
june
of
1972.
it
just
ruled
on
a
different
theory
of
law.
the
issue
has
been
before
the
courts
on
eminent
domain
by
glen
alps
at
every
--
at
all
times
since
december
of
1970.
might
i
add
two
other
quick
observations,
if
i
may?
the
date
of
evaluation
nationwide,
if
this
court
determines
that
--
i
take
it,
the
nature
of
inverse
is
allowed
by
section
357
need
not
always
be
at
the
date
of
physical
invasion.
under
the
laws
of
each
state,
the
date
of
evaluation
differs.
now,
under
alaska
law,
city
of
nesbett
versus
anchorage
is
under
united
states
law,
dow
versus
united
states,
that
date
is
in
fact
the
date
of
invasion,
but
it
varies
from
place
to
place.
other
states
have
the
date
of
evaluation
at
the
time
of
filing
of
complaint.
some,
like
california,
under
certain
circumstances,
have
the
date
of
evaluation
at
the
time
of
trial
or
the
payment
of
the
award.
so,
it's
not
uniform.
now,
two
other
things,
one,
the
allegation
is
made
by
the
united
states
in
tabbytite,
“we
would
like
to
have
an
election
of
remedies.
we
would
like
to
have
trespass
and
injunction
as
we
--
as
opposed
to
just
compensation.”
again,
under
the
laws
of
the
eminent
domain
statutes
of
each
state,
this
varies
from
state
to
state.
under
the
state
of
alaska,
clearly,
there
is
no
election
of
remedies.
the
wickwire
versus
jubelirer
case
decided
that,
but
that's
not
uniform
nationwide.
for
instance,
colorado
is
at
the
other
extreme.
if
you
take
the
aspen
case
versus
mountain
states
telephone
and
telegraph,
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
in
1974,
the
condemnee,
if
in
a
situation
of
inverse
condemnation,
was
given
such
election
remedies.
so,
this
isn't
a
uniform
thing
nationwide.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
two
other
observations,
slight
corrections
in
my
brief.
i'd
indicated
in
my
brief
that
leg
--
that
administrative
opinion
and
practice
was
of
little
consequence.
at
that
time,
i
had
not
had
access
to
the
briefs
of
minnesota,
but
i
believe
that
the
minnesota
case,
113
f.2d,
administrative
procedure
is
persuasive
in
this
case.
the
last
thing
i
wish
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
is
that
i
have
found
one
case
in
the
reply
brief
of
tabbytite
which
is
unfavorable
to
my
client
and
i
feel
an
ethical
obligation
to
disclose
this
to
the
court.
in
the
united
states
versus
northern
trading
and
transport
company,
justice
brandeis
ruled
that
condemnation
and
implied
contract
were
different
beasts.
however,
in
subsequent
cases
following
that,
the
next
year,
the
united
states
versus
rogers,
255
us
163,
a
similar
situation
was
found
to
stem
directly
from
the
fifth
amendment.
in
seaboard
airline
versus
united
states,
261
us
299,
1923,
another
requisition
for
military
goods
cause
of
action
found
to
stem
directly
from
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
same
in
phelps
versus
united
states,
274
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
phelps
versus
united
states,
274
us
341.
my
only
explanation
for
the
northern
transport
case,
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
that
were
submitted,
there
are
--
there
was
no
claim
in
the
petition
of
the
court
of
claims
which
alleged
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
were
two
common
counts
for
debt
and
breach
of
contract
and
in
light
of
the
subsequent
cases,
i
can
only
believe
that
justice
brandeis
ruled
as
he
did
by
narrowly
construing
in
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
i
would
--
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
a
more
equitable
date.
i
think
that,
in
terms
of
policy,
it
definitely
would.
in
terms
of
law,
i
think
this
is
a
matter
that
is
probably
fixed
by
the
eminent
domain
laws
of
each
state.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
and
it
varies
widely.
it's
a
good
equitable
decision.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
yes,
i
think
that
--
well,
there
are
two
statutory
grounds
that
are
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
the
first
of
which
is
the
argument
that
section
311
concerning
secretarial
grants
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
--
controls
over
section
357
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
--
because
it
is
more
specific.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
the
other
one
is
the
allegation
that
there
has
been
a
repeal
by
implication
of
357
by
the
act
of
february
5,
1948
which
currently
contains
title
25
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
these
are
both
raised
by
tabbytite
for
the
first
time.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
that
is
always
the
case
when
a
constitutional
issue
is
raised.
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
your
honor
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
situation
that
the
court
must
face
at
any
time
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
--
an
appellant
raises
--
mr.
richard
a.
weinig
--
a
constitutional
issue.
