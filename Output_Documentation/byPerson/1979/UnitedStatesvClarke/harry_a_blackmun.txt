mr.
dalton,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
start?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
be
joining
mrs.
tabbytite's
arguments
if
they
had
been
raised
below
and
on
a
petition
for
cert?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
certainly
are
these
differences.
doesn't
the
case
really
come
down
to
the
date?
that's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
your
argument
about,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
i
understand
you
then
you
take
the
position
that
inverse
condemnation
always
violates
due
process
or
just
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
this
ever
been
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
the
reason
it
wasn't
raised?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
a
matter
of
curio
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
this
right
in
the
built
up
section
of
anchorage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
more
question,
if
you
knew
before
hand
that
you
were
taking
property
for
a
public
purpose,
under
alaska
law,
do
you
have
an
obligation
to
bring
formal
condemnation
proceedings?
