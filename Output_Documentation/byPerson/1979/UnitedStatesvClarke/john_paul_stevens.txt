mr.
dalton,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
one
question
keeps
running
through
my
mind.
you're
denying
that
there
was
a
taking
here,
that
the
indian
inverse
condemnation,
and
the
government,
as
i
remember
it,
is
seeking
an
injunction.
you
want
to
stop
traffic
from
going
over
the
road
until
the
state
institutes
a
condemnation
proceeding.
is
that
what
you
want
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
therefore,
you
close
off
the
road
to
traffic
until
the
condemnation
proceeding
is
concluded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
few
commuters
may
be
unhappy,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
few
commuters
may
be
unhappy.
it's
sort
of
a
main
thoroughfare,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
