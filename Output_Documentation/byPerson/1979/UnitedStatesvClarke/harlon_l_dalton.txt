mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
is
called
upon
to
determine
the
means
by
which
states
and
municipalities
may
acquire
rights
of
way
across
land
allotted
to
indians
and
held
in
fee
by
the
united
states.
the
precise
question
presented
today
is
whether
the
municipality
of
anchorage
may,
invoking
section
357
of
title
25,
acquire
a
private
road
running
across
the
allotment
of
one
bertha
mae
tabbytite
by
simply
taking
over
that
roadway
and
saying,
in
effect,
“sue
me.”
in
1954,
ms.
tabbytite
entered
onto
the
land
in
question
and
began
to
homestead
it.
four
years
later,
respondents,
clarke
and
baker,
filed
a
homestead
application
on
an
adjoining-80
acres
and,
two
months
after
that,
bulldozed
a
road
across
the
tabbytite
allotment
without
seeking
or
obtaining
her
consent
and
without
obtaining
an
easement
from
anyone.
tabbytite
protested
and
continued
to
protest
for
the
11
years
from
the
construction
of
the
road
in
1958
until
this
suit
was
commenced
in
1969,
without
success.
now,
from
1968
to
19
--
1958,
rather,
to
1966,
clarke
--
neighbors
clarke
and
baker
interposed
three
contests
to
tabbytite's
application
for
a
homestead
patent
as
a
result
of
which,
she
was
unable
to
perfect
that
application
during
the
pendency
of
those
contests.
clarke
and
baker,
however,
were
able
to
obtain,
in
1961,
a
homestead
patent
for
their
property
and
they
properly
subdivided
it
into
40
parcels
which
were
essentially
sold
before
this
suit
was
instituted.
also,
in
1961,
the
city
of
glen
alps,
third-class
city
of
glen
alps,
was
incorporated
and
took
over
maintenance
of
the
road.
essentially,
that
city
covered
the
territory
surrounding
the
property
of
all
of
the
aforementioned
parties
to
this
litigation.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
exactly.
in
1966,
apparently
despairing
of
ever
obtaining
the
--
her
homestead
patent,
tabbytite
elected
to
take
her
land
as
an
indian
allotment,
as
she
was
entitled
to
do.
in
1967,
she
attempted
to
block
the
road.
prior
to
that,
her
attempts
to
block
trespassers
essentially
amounted
to
posting
“no
trespassing”
signs.
in
1967,
she
tried
physically
to
block
the
road,
but
pulled
back
when
glen
clarke
indicated
to
her
that
she
could
be
arrested
for
so
doing.
at
that
point,
she
turned
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
with
her
predicament.
in
1969,
the
united
states
government
instituted
this
suit
to
close
the
road
and
to
seek
damages.
in
1973,
the
district
court,
in
fact,
awarded
damages
but
declined
to
enter
injunction
holding
that
the
road
across
the
tabbytite
allotment
constituted
a
way
of
necessity,
and
that
to
close
it
would
create
undue
hardship
for
the
defendants.
now,
that
determination
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
1976.
just
a
few
months
before
that
reversal,
however,
anchorage
and
glen
alps
merged
in
effect.
there
was
a
unification
of
anchorage
and
two
smaller
communities,
and
as
the
resulted
entity
of
the
municipality
of
anchorage
took
over
maintenance
of
the
road
and
entered
this
lawsuit.
now,
on
remand,
the
municipality
of
anchorage
opposed
the
government's
injunction
--
request
for
injunction
on
the
grounds
that
its
predecessor
in
interest,
glen
alps,
had,
in
effect,
condemned
the
land
inversely
back
in
1961
when
it
took
over
the
road.
the
district
court
entered
two
opinions,
the
second
time
around,
which
together
held
that
glen
alps
did
not
have
the
power
of
inverse
condemnation
and,
therefore,
had
not
acquired
the
land
in
1961
but
that
in
1975,
when
anchorage
and
glen
alps
were
unified,
anchorage
had
effectively
obtained
the
land
by
inverse
condemnation
and
that
that
was
satisfactory
within
the
meaning
of
section
357.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
i
would
not
s
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
on
the
contrary.
the
government's
position
is
180-degrees
away
from
that
position.
our
position
is
that,
despite
the
similarity
of
terminology,
inverse
condemnation
and
condemnation
are
by
no
means
equivalent
and,
indeed,
i
may
not
use
the
term
“inverse
condemnation”
again
today.
what
inverse
condemnation
is
essentially
is
the
second
half
of
a
taking
by
seizure.
reverse
condemnation
is
a
phrase
that's
been
used
to
des
--
really
to
describe
the
fact
that
land
owners
whose
land
is
taken
inadvertently
by
the
sovereign
had
a
constitutional
right
to
just
compensation
and
the
so-called
reverse
condemnation
proceeding
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
absolutely
and,
indeed,
one
of
our
contentions
is
that,
though
this
is
somewhere
further
down
the
line
of
my
argument,
that
is
a
general
proposition
we're
taking
our
purposeful
it
is
a
policy
of
the
united
states
and
the
policy
of
the
state
of
alaska
that
those
takings
proceed
by
condemnation
not
by
seizure.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
line
of
authority,
but
i
trust
that
it
exists.
it
strikes
me
as
helpful
to
the
government's
argument.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
absolutely.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
anchorage
has
the
power
under
alaska
law
--
eminent
domain
law
to
affect
takings
this
by
seizure
and
that's
because
this
land
is
owned
in
fee
by
the
united
states
and
absent
the
consent
of
the
united
states,
there
is
no
method
by
which
anchorage
can
acquire
a
roadway
across
the
tabbytite
allotment.
now,
section
347,
on
its
face,
appears
to
consent
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
united
states'
sovereign
immunity
with
reference
to
state's
attempts
to
condemn
allotted
land.
i
suppose
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
acknowledge,
as
the
court
is
aware,
that
respondent
tabbytite
draws
into
question
whether
even
section
357,
at
this
point,
constitutes
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
when
rights
of
way
are
at
issue
and
particularly
when
roadway
rights
of
way
are
at
issue.
but,
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
section
357
does
apply,
it
should
be
construed
narrowly,
both
because
it
constitutes
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
because
takings
under
it,
condemnation
under
it,
in
effect,
potentially
results
in
derogation
of
interest
of
indians.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
we
certainly
take
the
position
that
section
357
has
to
be
adhered
to
and
that
means
that,
until
a
formal
condemnation
proceeding
is
brought,
this
taking
constitutes
a
trespass
and,
so,
i
think
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
i
take
it,
that
would,
by
the
way,
impose
no
hardship
on
the
municipality
of
anchorage,
in
that,
when
glen
alps
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
again
please?
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
it
is
a
main
thoroughfare
in
the
context
of
a
dirt
road
and
one
lane
going
either
direction
but,
for
that
part
of
the
world,
it
is
a
main
thoroughfare.
but,
when
glen
alps
was
involved
in
this
litigation,
it,
in
fact,
filed
a
counterclaim
for
formal
condemnation
in
the
event
that
its
way
of
necessity
argument
was
rejected
by
the
court.
now,
at
that
point,
the
district
court
did
uphold
that
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
at
that
point,
the
municipality
of
anchorage
essentially
reserve
the
right
within
30
days
of
in
adverse
decision
to
it
in
this
litigation
to
bring
a
formal
condemnation
action
until
it
strikes
me
that
they're
quite
prepared
to
proceed
in
that
fashion
if
necessary.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
anchorage
has
insisted
in
its
brief
that
the
term
“condemnation”
--
that
the
definition
of
the
term
“condemnation”
in
section
357
is
subject
to
state
law
because
section
357
provides
that
condemnation
may
proceed
under
the
laws
of
the
states
where
the
property
is
situated,
but
we
submit
that
that
simply
cannot
be.
the
term
“condemnation”
is
central
to
what
congress
was
about
in
section
357.
it's
determinative
of
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and,
to
leave
states
free
to
define
the
very
right
which
congress
confers
in
that
section,
we
submit,
would
stand
the
whole
notion
of
consent
and
waiver
on
its
head.
the
decision
below
and
anchorage
in
its
brief
also
suggest
that
united
states
seeks
to
deny
indians
the
right
to
bring
suits
for
just
compensation.
we
certainly
don't
oppose
the
rights
of
indians
to
receive
just
compensation
but
that,
of
course,
can
be
obtained
in
the
context
of
a
formal
condemnation
proceeding.
our
point,
rather,
is
that
the
state
cannot
relegate
indian
allotees
to
an
action
for
just
compensation
because,
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
your
first
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
phrase
proceeding
for
just
compensation,
while
fairly
mutual
on
its
face,
really
carries
with
it
the
reality
that,
at
some
point,
a
taking
by
seizure
has
occurred
or
is
being
contemplated.
and,
since
it's
our
position
that
a
taking
by
seizure
cannot
be
squared
with
section
357,
it
is
inconsistent
to
place
allottees
in
the
position
of
having
to
--
the
burden
of
bringing
an
action
for
just
compensation.
now,
there
may
be
a
case
in
which
there
would
be
inadvertent
taking
in
which
an
allottee
ought
to
be
freed
to
elect
to
proceed
in
an
action
for
just
compensation,
but
that's
not
this
case.
that
need
not
happen
pursuant
to
section
357.
that
is,
as
this
court
has
said
more
than
once,
essentially
a
constitutional
right.
we,
of
course,
acknowledge
that
seizures
by
taking
do
exist.
that
the
tucker
act,
in
federal
practices
is
the
proceeding
by
which
persons
whose
land
has
been
taken,
may
indeed
proceed
for
just
compensation.
this
existed
at
the
turn
of
the
century
at
the
time
357
was
enacted
as
it
exists
today.
in
general,
we
agree
that
it's
an
appropriate
remedy
for
inadvertent
takings,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
this
land
owner's
remedy
can
be
converted
into
a
means
by
which
a
sovereign,
like
the
municipality
of
anchorage,
can
acquire
a
roadway
affirmatively
purposefully
across
an
indian
allotment.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'm
looking
at
the
clock,
i've
got
about
a
minute,
i
can
enter
into
my
next
argument
or
i
can
pick
it
up
in
the
morning.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
thank
you.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
sure.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
i
also
might
add
that
if
the
court
has
mind
to
entertain
those
arguments,
then
the
government
would
be
pleased
if
the
court
would
reach
them
in
this
case
because
it
appears
that
even
if
the
government
prevails
on
the
arguments
that
we've
made,
those
arguments
could
be
raised
in
the
context
of
condemnation
proceeding,
and
this
proceeding
has
already
gone
on
for
10
years.
so,
it
may
be
better
to
end
it
once
and
for
all
at
this
juncture.
as
i
think
i
indicated
yesterday,
the
heart
of
the
government's
case
is
the
proposition
that
takings
by
seizure
are
not
the
functional
or
the
legal
equivalent
of
takings
by
condemnation.
both
modes,
of
course,
ultimately
result
in
dispossession
of
the
land
owner,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
involved,
but
there
the
similarity
ends.
before
land
can
be
taken
by
condemnation,
several
events
must
occur.
a
notice
must
be
given
to
all
parties
with
an
interest
in
the
land,
and
that's
particularly
important
in
the
allotment
context
since
allottees
need
not
reside
on
their
allotments
and
the
united
states
government
certainly
does
not.
before
land
can
be
taken
by
condemnation,
the
land
must
be
described.
there
must
be
determination
of
authority
for
the
taking
and
this
case
illustrates
the
significance
of
that
requirement,
in
that,
given
the
dispute
over
the
power
of
the
city
of
glen
alps
to
proceed
by
eminent
domain.
fourteen
years
after
glen
alps
took
over
the
road,
a
court
finally
determined
that
it
did
not
even
have
the
power
to
proceed
in
any
fashion
by
eminent
domain.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
that's
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
even
once
--
let's
assume
the
taking
has
occurred,
the
proceeding
for
just
compensation
does
not
make
up
for
the
deficiencies
prior
to
that
point
because
the
date
of
taking
fixes
the
time
of
evaluation
or
the
property
and,
in
a
taking
by
seizure,
that
date
that
possession
or
seizure
occurs
whereas
in
a
condemnation
proceeding,
the
evaluation
of
the
land
does
not
occur
until
condemnation
is
actually--
until
con
--
compensation
is
actually
paid
and,
that's
significant
because
there
are
necessarily
delays
when
a
taking
by
seizure
occurs.
in
fact,
there
are
incentives
for
delay
and
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
or
at
the
date
of
the
bringing
of
the
condemnation
proceeding.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
sir.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
date
of
the
action,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
correct.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
precisely,
and
so,
in
that
sense,
the
--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
precisely.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
exactly.
there's
one
other
major
distinction
in
terms
of
the
additional
--
well,
in
terms
of
the
deficiencies
of
a
proceeding
by
inverse
condemnation
that
i'd
like
to
draw
to
the
court's
attention
and
that's
the
fact
that,
in
an
--
in
a
proceeding
for
just
compensation
or
an
inverse
condemnation
proceeding,
ordinarily,
the
land
owner
cannot
challenge
the
authority
for
the
taking.
contrary
to
suggestions
in
the
municipality's
brief,
the
crosby
case
in
ala
--
from
the
alaska
supreme
court
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
authority
for
taking
can
be
challenged
in
a
compensation
proceeding.
and,
indeed,
the
line
of
cases,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
which
you
alluded
yesterday
in
the
toccara
cases
involving
unauthorized
takings,
certainly
in
those
cases,
the
court
determined
that
the
takings
were
unauthorized,
but
it
was
in
a
peculiar
posture
because
the
government
asserted
the
unauthorized
nature
of
the
taking
as
a
defense
to
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes
sir.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes
sir.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
precisely.
thank
you.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes
and,
indeed,
i
think
that's
the
force
of
the
cases
that
you
brought
to
my
attention
yesterday,
yes
sir.
with
the
court's
permission,
if
i
have
any
time
remaining,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
