it
wasn't
annexed
to

it
was
just
incorporated
as

city.
justice
william

rehnquist
in
inverse
condemnation
actions
they
brought
under
the
tucker
act,
isn't
there
a
long
line
of
federal
authorities
holding
that
if
the
government
may
defend
such
an
action
by
saying
congress
had
not
authorized
the
intrusion
and,
then,
the
person's
remedy
is
simply
to
have
a
person
--
have
their
land
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
evaluation
of
the
land
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
doesn't
take
place
or
as
of
the
date
of
payment?

of

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government,
being
clothed
with
eminent
domain
does
not
mean
that
it
can
simply
--
that
the
bureau
of
land
management
can
simply
wander
around
the
country
and
seize
various
pieces
of
property
requires
an
authorization
by
congress
as
to
the
particular
property.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think,
in
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
it's
consistent
with
our
decision
in
the
railroad
reorganization
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
based
largely
on
statute,
wasn't
it?
that
the
government
--
that
the
bia
had
represented
in
appropriations
hearings
time
after
time
that
it
was
providing
assistance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's,
in
effect,
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning,
isn't
it,
that
it's
just
a
--
two
horses
that
are
--
maybe
have
different
labels,
but
they're
the
same
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
point
is
a
valid
one,
but
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
feel
back
on
the
idea
that
we
might
as
well
wrap
up
this
whole
ball
of
wax
here
now
that
you're,
in
effect,
using
the
same
type
of
reasoning
that
the
ninth
circuit
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weinig
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
get
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
those
facts?
you
say
the
mun
--
condemning
authority
would
have
to
file
a
c
--
an
action
in
condemnation,
but
not
necessarily
a
declaration
of
taking.
what
would
be
complaint
in
condemnation
have
to
describe
with
particularity,
the
property
that
was
to
be
taken?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
there
circumstances
under
which
it
would
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
state
of
alaska
allow
unorganized
municipality
such
as
glen
alps,
as
i
understand
was
at
one
time,
to
condemn?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
at
all
times,
it
has
been
a
third-class
city
and
not
just
a
collection
of
people
around
an
or
--
a
municipality.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
united
states
against
clarke,
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
federal
authorizes
a
state
or
local
government
to
"condemn"
alloted
indian
trust
lands
by
physical
occupation.
that
section
provides
that
lands
alloted
to
the
indians
may
be
condemned
for
any
public
purpose
under
the
laws
of
the
state
or
territory
where
located
in
the
same
manner
as
land
owned
in
fee
may
be
condemned.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
section
357
which
is
the
act
in
question
permits
acquisition
of
alloted
lands
by
what
is
come
to
be
known
as
"inverse
condemnation."
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
point
and
accordingly
reverse
its
judgment.
we
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
meaning
of
the
statute
may
be
determined
by
the
admittedly
old-fashioned
by
nonetheless
entirely
appropriate
plain
meaning
canon
of
statutory
construction.
and
although
the
landowner
action
to
recover
just
compensation
for
a
taking
by
a
physical
intrusion
has
come
to
referred
as
inverse
or
reverse
condemnation
for
the
simple
term
condemn
and
condemnation
which
are
used
in
the
statute
are
not
commonly
used
to
describe
such
an
action.
rather,
a
condemnation
proceeding
is
commonly
understood
to
be
an
action
brought
by
the
condemning
authorities
such
as
the
government
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
of
imminent
domain.
the
legal
and
practical
differences
between
condemnation
and
inverse
condemnation
convinces
that
section
357
authorizes
the
condemnation
of
lands
pursuant
to
laws
of
the
state
or
territory.
the
term
"condemned"
refers
not
to
an
action
by
a
landowner
to
recover
compensation
for
a
taking
that
has
already
occurred
but
to
a
formal
condemnation
proceeding
instituted
by
the
condemning
authority.

justice
blackmun
joined
by
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
