justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
--
doesn't
–
doesn't
the
section
refer
to
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
authorize
any
condemnations
of
state
law,
does
it?
and
that,
i
suppose
an
adequate
answer
to
a
question
like
mr.
justice
powell
might
be
if
there
were
some
alaska
law
that
alaska
law
just,
itself,
doesn't
allow
inverse
condemnations
of
the
kind
that
he
referred
to.
is
there
some
alaska
law
about
inverse
condemnations
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
go
any
further
than
--
does
it
--
do
they
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
you
may
condemn
by
force
rather
than
by
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
--
i
take
it,
your
submission
then
is
that
whatever
happened
here
is
wholly
consistent
with
alaska
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
is
authorized
by
alaska
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
doesn't
violate
any
constitutional
limitations
and,
hence,
you
should
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
some
other
situation
comes
up
some
time
different
there
may
be
some
constitutional
limitations
on
what
the
state
of
alaska
and,
hence,
what
this
federal
statute
can
authorize,
but
you
--
i
suppose
you
suggest
that
nothing
like
that
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
alaska
law,
this
is
one
of
those
situations
where
an
inverse
condemnation
is
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
say
that
since
it
is
permissible
under
alaska
law,
it
should
be
permissible
here
unless
there's
some
constitutional
prohibition
and
you
say
there
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose,
if
the
--
if
this
property
--
if
this
property
hadn't
been
taken
to
the
anchorage
but
is
still
owned
by
glen
alps,
i
suppose
--
and
since
it
didn't
have
power
to
condemn,
it
didn't
have
power
to
inversely
condemn
either
and
so
this
section
wouldn't
authorize
any
kind
of
condemnation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
the
section
depends
on
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you'd
have
to
give
the
property
back
if
there
was
no
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
you
still
object
or
your
brief
says
we
should
not
consider
the
--
one
of
the
statutory
grounds
that's
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what's
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they're
both
raised
by
tabbytite?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
that
if
you
were
to
prevail
on
either
one
of
those,
we
would
avoid
reaching
constitutional
questions
that
seem
to
be
hovering
in
them.
you
can't
win
–
you
can't
win
without
our
--
on
your
ground
without
our
rejecting
whatever
constitutional
arguments
that
are
being
made
here,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
so
--
but
we
wouldn't
reach
them
if
we
decided
against
you
on
any
statutory
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you
very
much.
