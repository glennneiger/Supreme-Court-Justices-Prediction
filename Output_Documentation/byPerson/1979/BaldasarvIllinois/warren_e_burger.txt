chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
77-6219,
baldasar
v.
illinois.
mr.
mulder,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
tax
driver's
license,
would
he
be
barred
from
getting
a
tax
driver's
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
mr.
baldasar's
vocation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
contend
that
if
a
judge
in
his
sentencing
had
a
range
in
the
indeterminate
sentence
approach
and
the
pre-sentence
report
excludes
all
the
facts
that
are
disclosed
in
this
case,
that
he
was
constitutionally
barred
from
taking
that
into
account
in
fixing
a
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
jury
sentence
in
illinois
or
does
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
williams
v.
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
judge
can
look
at
all
sorts
of
hearsay
that
wasn't
put
to
nearly
the
test
that
this
uncounseled
conviction
was
at
the
time
of
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
he
be
suffering
in
any
different
sequence
if
the
sentencing
judge
were
taking
this
into
account
in
the
hypothetical
we
discussed
earlier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
he
be
suffering
then
for
the
first
time
in
your
terms
for
what
you
consider
his
first
conviction
which
you
concede
is
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
thought
you
conceded
that
the
judge
could
take
that
into
account
under
williams
v.
new
york
and
cases
since
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
had.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
from
the
cost
point
of
view,
though,
the
reason
for
the
state
foregoing
the
cost
in
the
initial
round
where
there
isn't
any
threat
of
imprisonment
is
that
it
is
just
a
great
big
three-million
square-mile
country
where
it
isn't
always
that
easy
in
lots
of
non-metropolitan
areas
to
obtain
counsel.
so
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
trial
at
all,
even
on
the
misdemeanor,
you
may
well
have
to
have
it,
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
speedy
trial,
without
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
involve
a
waiver,
too,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
involve
a
waiver
also.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
here
at
1:00
o'clock,
if
you
have
any
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mulder,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
said
that,
mr.
mulder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
binds
any
other
litigant
here
or
binds
this
court,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
or
any
other
state
when
he
has
a
case
here
is
out
to
win
that
case
and
not
some
other
case,
isn't
that
the
usual
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
can
hardly
bind
his
own
court
either.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
no.
