mr.
michael
mulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
an
illinois
conviction
of
a
petitioner
sentenced
for
theft
under
an
enhanced
penalty
statute.
the
charge
that
the
petitioner
was
facing
was
the
theft
of
a
dial
massage
shower
head,
having
a
value
of
less
than
$150.
he
was
charged
with
taking
that
from
montgomery
ward
on
november
13,
1975.
now,
this
information
also
charged
as
an
additional
element
that
this
was
his
second
theft
conviction,
the
first
occurring
in
may
of
1975.
ordinarily,
under
illinois,
had
there
only
been
one
theft
conviction
charged
in
the
statute,
the
punishment
would
have
been
classified
as
a
misdemeanor
and
he
would
have
been
punished
by
up
to
less
than
one
year
with
no
parole
and
the
incarceration
could
have
taken
place
in
other
than
a
penitentiary.
however,
in
illinois,
under
this
enhanced
penalty
statute,
upon
a
second
conviction
the
penalty
would
be
classified
as
a
felony
punishable
one
to
three
years,
with
two
years
of
automatic
parole
followed,
and
that
also
the
incarceration
would
occur
in
a
penitentiary
as
opposed
to
a
jail
or
another
institution.
mr.
michael
mulder
yes,
it
has
been
served
and
the
parole
term
has
also
been
served,
mr.
justice.
we
are
arguing
for
a
--
here
we
are
attacking
the
conviction
and
i
believe
that
the
court
has
held
that
even
though
a
sentence
has
been
served
we
can
still
attack
the
felony
conviction.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
do
feel
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
there
are
ramifications
of
the
case.
for
example,
under
the
illinois
statute,
the
new
sentencing
statute,
the
petitioner
could
be
exposed
to
an
extended
term
upon
conviction
of
the
same
class
felony
on
the
basis
of
his
prior
felony,
and
this
statute
involved
there
is
chapter
38,
section
1005-5(3)(2)(b),
and
also
1005-8-2(a).
there
may
also
be
ramifications
with
regard
to
the
petitioner's
future
employment
on
the
basis
of
this
felony.
under
illinois
law,
a
license
may
be
refused
to
issue
on
the
basis
of
this
felony,
and
as
an
example
of
that
the
sections
for
dentists
--
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
that
the
case
in
the
past
base
on
these
ramifications
would
be
ginsberg
v.
new
york,
which
is
found
at
390
u.s.
629,
possible
ineligibility
into
employment
was
looked
at
by
the
court
there.
mr.
michael
mulder
no,
he
is
not
a
dentist.
what
i
am
trying
to
make
a
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
it
may
affect
his
future
employment,
that
it
does
have
a
ramification
for
future
employment.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
believe
in
illinois
that
they
can
vote
after
the
sentence
has
been
imposed.
mr.
michael
mulder
or
served,
yes,
i'm
sorry,
after
it
has
been
served.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
licenses
where
he
may
not
be
barred
but
where
it
may
be
taken
into
consideration.
that
is
a
general
wording
of
the
statute
in
illinois,
that
it
may
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
michael
mulder
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
mulder
not
to
my
knowledge
on
that
either.
i
think
most
of
them
read
conviction
of
a
felony.
mr.
michael
mulder
mr.
baldasar
is
a
semi-skilled
worker
and
i
believe
at
this
time
he
is
working
in
a
factory
but
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
his
employment
in
the
factory
is.
your
honors,
at
trial
there
was
an
objection
to
the
entry
of
this
prior
misdemeanor
conviction
which
was
uncounseled.
the
basis
of
the
objection
was
burgett
v.
texas,
and
defense
counsel
made
the
objection
stating
that
she
felt
that
the
evidence
would
show
that
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
the
prior
misdemeanor
proceedings,
but
that
the
state
had
an
affirmative
showing
to
show
that
he
was
represented.
what
happened
was
that
the
court
overruled
the
objection
and
said
that
this
did
not
apply
to
felony
proceedings.
on
appeal,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
over
the
dissent
of
one
judge.
our
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
denied,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
prohibit
the
use
of
the
prior
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
which
did
not
result
in
imprisonment
to
increase
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
on
a
subsequent
conviction
under
an
enhanced
penalty
statute.
mr.
michael
mulder
there
is
no
question
that
under
scott
v.
illinois
that
it
was
proper
and
a
valid
conviction,
your
honor.
i
think
in
sum
our
argument
is
that
the
prior
uncounseled
conviction,
even
though
valid
for
purposes
of
a
fine,
is
not
valid
for
purposes
of
incarceration.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
prohibit
that
under
tucker
v.
united
states.
i
think
that
that
is
much
closer
a
question
than
our
case
at
bar
now
because
in
our
case
at
bar
the
imprisonment
flows
as
a
"but
for"
consequence.
in
other
words,
when
you
face
the
enhanced
penalty
situation
in
illinois,
upon
that
second
conviction
being
proved
up,
the
judge
has
a
whole
new
range
of
options.
instead
of
less
than
one
year,
he
now
imposes
one
to
three,
with
the
parole
to
follow.
but
i
think
the
problem
with
your
--
with
that
argument,
which
i
believe
the
amicus
makes,
that
if
hearsay
statements
can
come
into
the
presentence
report
and
if
arrest
reports
can
come
into
the
presentence
report,
why
can't
we
use
these
uncounseled
convictions
which
are
at
least
as
reliable
as
that.
ordinarily,
when
counsel
approaches
the
bench
at
such
a
sentencing
hearing,
he
can
argue
that
the
hearsay
isn't
worth
very
much
or
that
the
arrest
record
doesn't
mean
very
much.
but
the
problem
with
the
amicus
argument
is
that
they
want
to
use
that
conviction
for
full
value,
they
want
to
treat
it
like
any
other
conviction
with
counsel,
and
i
think
that
is
the
real
danger
involved.
so
i
think
the
better
approach
--
and
again
i
think
the
analogy
can
be
made
to
tucker
v.
united
states
--
is
that
that
shouldn't
flow
from
the
conviction.
mr.
michael
mulder
the
judge
does,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mulder
well,
i
think
in
the
same
manner
that
tucker
v.
united
states
distinguished
williams,
and
that
was
that
where
there
was
no
counsel
at
that
prior
conviction,
the
court
would
look
at
it
in
a
different
manner
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
used
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
and
i
think
what
our
argument
is
that
it
is
not
reliable
to
impose
imprisonment
and
therefore
should
not
be
looked
at
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
michael
mulder
that's
true,
and
admittedly
it
is
a
closer
case.
but
i
think
if
we
can
say
from
the
sentencing
hearing
that
the
additional
imprisonment
resulted
from
that
prior
uncounseled
conviction,
that
the
better
approach
would
be
not
to
use
it.
but
again
i
say
that
the
consequence,
the
collateral
consequence
in
our
case
is
a
lot
more
direct.
it
is
the
"but
for"
causation.
and
i
think
the
analogy
to
burgett
can
be
made.
in
burgett,
it
was
reversed
on
the
basis
of
an
invalid
conviction
under
gideon
v.
wainwright.
admittedly,
as
i
spoke
before,
the
conviction
here
is
valid
but
the
defect
in
burgett
was
the
lack
of
counsel,
and
that
is
the
same
defect
that
existed
here.
and
our
argument
is
that
the
fact
that
imprisonment
was
imposed
on
burgett
does
not
add
any
reliability
to
that
conviction.
in
burgett,
the
court
found
that
burgett
was
suffering
anew
from
that
uncounseled
conviction.
and
although
petitioner
baldasar
did
not
suffer
initially
imprisonment,
he
is
in
a
sense
suffering
imprisonment
for
the
first
time
at
the
subsequent
proceeding,
so
that
he
too
suffers
anew
from
the
uncounseled
conviction.
mr.
michael
mulder
clearly,
there
is
a
difference
in
that
in
burgett
the
conviction
was
invalid
and
here
the
conviction
is
valid.
but
our
point
is
that
the
defect
underlying
the
reasoning
in
burgett
was
lack
of
counsel,
and
he
has
no
counsel
at
that
prior
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction.
the
amicus
and
the
respondent
seem
to
take
the
argument
that
the
central
premise
of
argersinger
was
imprisonment,
and
i
believe
that
it
is
true
but
it
can't
be
looked
at
out
of
the
context.
i
think
what
has
to
be
taken
into
accoun-
here
is
that
it
was
not
only
imprisonment
but
it
was
a
decision
involving
the
right
to
counsel,
and
that
when
counsel
was
provided
the
assurance
of
reliability
and
the
degree
necessary
to
impose
imprisonment
would
be
available
upon
that.
more
simply,
i
think
what
we
can
say
is
that
where
a
fine
is
acceptable,
it
is
acceptable
because
a
worse
consequence
has
been
removed.
a
counselless
conviction
for
a
fine,
the
worse
consequence
of
imprisonment
has
been
removed.
and
i
think
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
imprisonment
has
been
imposed
at
a
later
date,
but
that
doesn't
make
the
conviction
any
more
reliable
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
occurred
some
place
down
the
road.
mr.
michael
mulder
that's
true,
but
under
illinois
--
and
i
don't
think
you
can
get
away
from
the
fact
that
part
of
the
charge
--
and
i
think
the
state's
argument
that
he
is
being
punished
only
for
the
second
offense
is
perhaps
correct,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
element,
and
part
of
the
elements
charged
in
this
offense
is
the
first
one,
is
the
first
prior
uncounseled
conviction.
mr.
michael
mulder
perfectly
valid
for
only
the
purpose
of
fine,
not
for
the
purpose
of
imprisonment.
if
so,
like
in
burgett,
the
defendant
suffers
anew
from
that
uncounseled
conviction.
the
only
difference
is
here
he
is
suffering
for
the
first
time.
the
contributions,
of
course,
that
counsel
can
make
in
--
mr.
michael
mulder
going
back
to
the
hypothetical?
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
he
would
be
--
if
we
could
say
that
--
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
he
would
be
suffering
for
the
first
time
if
you
could
say
in
your
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
additional
imprisonment
arose
from
that
prior
uncounseled
conviction.
it
is
a
harder
--
mr.
michael
mulder
we
don't
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mulder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
mulder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
it
was
reliable
enough
for
purposes
of
a
fine.
mr.
michael
mulder
yes.
correct.
mr.
michael
mulder
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
goes
back
to
the
reasons
that
gideon
and
argersinger
were
based
on
and
that
is
the
contributions
that
counsel
can
make
at
those
proceedings.
he
can
assess
the
terms
of
the
statute's
constitutionality,
he
can
move
to
suppress
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence,
he
can
help
the
defendant
determine
whether
a
jury
--
mr.
michael
mulder
i
think
reliability
can
be
waived
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
cases
hold,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mulder
yes.
mr.
michael
mulder
correct.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
would
say
it
could
still
be
used
if
a
waiver
was
shown,
but
i
would
again
argue
that
under
burgett
that
is
the
state's
affirmative
burden,
to
show
any
waiver,
and
that
the
record
shows
here
that
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
claim
that
is
the
petitioner
prevails
in
this
case,
that
there
will
be
confusion.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
rule
could
be
easily
applied
here
and
simply
applied
if
the
state
seeks
to
enhance
imprisonment,
they
must
show
that
the
prior
conviction
that
the
defendant
was
either
represented
by
counsel
or
waived
counsel.
further,
they
claim
that
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosecutor
or
the
trial
court
judge
to
predict
whether
or
not
this
conviction
would
be
used
sometime
down
the
road.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
a
hard
decision
to
make
that
prediction
and
it
is
based
on
some
of
the
same
things
that
they
predict
initially
on
whether
to
grant
the
petitioner
counsel
or
not,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
offense,
the
circumstances
involved,
whether
there
was
violence
or
injury
to
any
person,
and
whether
a
pattern
of
criminal
conduct
is
developing.
if
those
things
appear,
then
the
tate
can
keep
their
option
open
to
use
this
at
a
later
enhancement,
to
use
this
as
later
enhancing
the
sentence
by
providing
counsel.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
the
court
on
the
matter
of
cost.
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
true
that
the
sixth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
of
these
convictions,
then
cost
may
be
irrelevant.
but
the
amicus
and
the
respondent
argue
it,
so
i
would
like
to
address
it.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
clear
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position,
and
that
would
be
that
the
same
option
that
was
left
open
in
argersinger
and
scott
still
exists.
that
is
that
if
the
state
chooses
not
to
provide
counsel,
it
doesn't
have
to.
it
can
simply
forego
the
option
of
imprisonment
so
that
no
cost
would
result
to
the
state
in
that
situation.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
point
out
with
regard
to
--
mr.
michael
mulder
well,
that
is
true
but
it
doesn't
add
any
additional
cost
to
the
state
to
continue
to
maintain
that
system.
even
under
argersinger
--
mr.
michael
mulder
two
points
i
think
with
regard
to
that.
first,
we
are
not
saying
here
that
the
state
can't
have
a
recidivist
statute.
we
are
merely
saying
that
if
they
do,
on
the
basis
of
misdemeanors,
they
have
to
provide
counsel
at
that
first
proceeding.
and
my
second
point
with
regard
to
that
is
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
problem
here
that
is
a
lot
smaller
in
scope
than
in
scott.
we
are
not
asking
that
counsel
be
supplied
in
every
misdemeanor
conviction.
for
one
thing,
there
are
many
of
them
that
don't
have
an
enhancement
provision
attached.
so
i
think
we
are
really
talking
about
a
much
smaller
--
mr.
michael
mulder
oh,
i
think
that
is
a
definite
problem.
but
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
penalize
the
repeat
offender,
we
ought
to
provide
counsel
to
make
sure
that
that
conviction
has
the
necessary
degree
of
reliability
to
result
in
this
case
in
two
extra
years
of
imprisonment.
mr.
michael
mulder
i
don't
believe
that
is
true.
i
don't
think
that
burgett
v.
texas
and
loper
v.
beto
go
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
mulder
no.
mr.
michael
mulder
well,
i
don't
think
the
cases
go
that
far
so
that
that
would
be
permitted.
but
why
i
think
that
at
least
a
facial
showing
that
counsel
was
there
is
required
under
those
cases
is
because
the
right
to
counsel
makes
the
other
rights,
the
other
due
process
rights
that
a
defendant
has
meaningful.
your
honors,
we
would
request
that
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
be
reversed
in
this
case.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
mulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
respond
to
two
points.
first,
the
attorney
general
has
claimed
that
his
position
has
not
changed
since
the
argument
in
scott.
as
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
two,
at
that
time
the
attorney
general
said
in
scott,
when
prosecuting
an
offense
the
prosecution
knows
that
by
not
requesting
that
counsel
be
appointed
for
the
defendant
he
will
be
precluded
from
enhancing
subsequent
offenses.
i
think
the
--
mr.
michael
mulder
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois
said
that
in
scott
v.
illinois.
mr.
michael
mulder
no,
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
binds
this
court,
but
i
think
for
the
respondent
to
claim
that
it
takes
a
gift
of
prophecy
to
apply
the
requested
rule
is
seriously
undermined
by
that
statement
which
recognized
that
it
could
be
easily
applied
in
a
previous
case.
mr.
michael
mulder
that
is
the
usual
procedure,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
mulder
no,
he
cannot.
your
honors,
the
second
thing
i
wish
to
point
out
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
also
argued
the
cost
factor
to
the
court
but
no
figures
have
been
cited,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
not
to
speculate
on
this
issue.
where
liberty
is
at
issue,
we
don't
believe
that
cost
is
a
relevant
factor
to
be
concerned
with.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
preclude
the
use
of
uncounseled
prior
misdemeanor
convictions
for
enhancement
purposes
and
reverse
this
case
for
a
new
trial.
thank
you,
your
honors.
