mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
stress
that
this
case
does
not
involve
situations
where
"but
for"
the
counselless
conviction
the
petition
would
not
have
been
incarcerated,
for
even
if
he
were
tried
in
this
case
without
the
use
of
that
first
conviction,
he
would
have
been
subject
to
incarceration
for
up
to
364
days.
thus
the
case
really
involves
an
increase
in
the
length
of
incarceration
and
not
the
fact
of
incarceration
itself.
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sentence
had
been
served,
i
had
contacted
the
illinois
department
of
corrections
just
last
week,
they
did
advise
that
the
sentence
had
been
served.
mr.
baldasar
served
a
total
of
one
year
and
six
months
and
one
day
incarceration.
your
honors,
the
petitioner
has
never
challenged
the
reliability
of
the
first
conviction
--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
if
there
had
not
been
a
prior
conviction,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
we
were
talking
simply
about
the
misdemeanor
theft
conviction,
he
could
have
served
up
to
364
days.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
parole
period
has
also
expired,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
really
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
that
is
an
interesting
question,
your
honor.
i
really
--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
your
honor,
i
had
not
frankly
considered
the
question
of
mootness
because
i
did
not
know
that
the
petitioner
had
even
served
his
total
period
of
time
until
just
last
week.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
the
conviction
was
i
believe
late
in
'76.
if
he
served
the
full
three
years,
we
would
be
talking
about
him
possibly
being
released
now.
he
would
still
be
serving
the
mandatory
parole
term
of
two
years.
so
in
theory
it
could
have
gone
on
for
two
years
from
now.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
the
only
possible
consequences
would
have
to
do
with
possibly
the
licenses,
the
occupations
he
might
be
barred
from.
i
believe
justice
burger
asked
about
the
taxi
license.
i
think
in
chicago
they
are
barred
from
having
a
tax
license.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
your
honor,
i
am
really
not
sure.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
think
there
is
some
interest.
i
think
there
is
a
great
question
involved
here
that
this
court
if
it
didn't
face
today
would
in
fact
face
at
a
later
date.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
if
in
fact
this
court
feels
the
case
is
moot
then
clearly
it
should
not
be
decided.
the
petitioners
never
challenged
the
reliability
of
his
first
conviction
other
than
his
general
arguments
as
to
the
question
of
reliability.
in
other
words,
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
he
did
not
even
raise
any
question
of
reliability.
he
has
never
talked
about
this
first
conviction
having
been
factually
inaccurate.
perhaps
the
defendant
did
a
poor
job
of
examining
witnesses,
that
type
of
question.
he
has
simply
stated
today
or
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court
that
their
first
conviction
lacks
reliability.
however,
the
petitioner
has
always
conceded
the
validity
of
that
first
conviction,
and
in
fact
he
conceded
that
validity
even
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
scott
v.
illinois
or
he
conceded
it
in
the
illinois
appellate
court.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
your
honor,
if
the
complaint
had
already
been
filed,
the
complaint
itself
would
have
had
to
have
alleged
the
prior
conviction.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
exactly.
therefore,
i
would
assume
that
the
complaint
could
not
later
be
amended,
assuming,
for
example,
that
he
is
convicted
on
the
first
case
without
counsel
or
with
counsel,
that
it
could
be
later
amended
to
charge
that
first
conviction.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
well,
i
would
imagine
it
would
depend
upon
how
close
we
were
to
trial
because
to
include
it
would
change
the
entire
crime
involved
from
a
misdemeanor,
as
we
have
on
its
face,
to
a
felony
where
the
person
could
be
incarcerated
for
a
longer
length
of
time.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no.
our
--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
exactly,
your
honor.
thus,
the
entire
argument
that
the
petitioners
made
simply
stated
is
that
his
uncounseled
conviction,
his
first
uncounseled
conviction
has
now
ended
up
in
incarceration
and
thus
argersinger
has
been
violated.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
an
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
which
is
valid
under
scott,
clearly
valid
under
scott,
like
any
other
valid
conviction,
can
be
used
for
certain
collateral
purposes,
one
of
which
is
sentence
enhancement.
we
believe
that
any
other
conclusion
would
substantially
undercut
this
court's
opinion
in
scott
and
would
create
untold
confusion
among
state
and
federal
courts
as
to
the
possible
collateral
uses
of
valid
convictions.
for
example,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
we
believe
that
a
ruling
in
petitioner's
favor
would
lead
to
similar
challenges
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prior
counselless
conviction
could
be
used
in
a
presentence
report,
whether
it
could
be
used
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
the
same
type
of
situation
that
did
arise
after
this
court's
decisions
after
burgett
and
loper
and
united
states
v.
tucker.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
the
predictive
evaluation
by
the
trial
judge
would
become
an
administrative
nightmare
for
the
judge
would
have
to
evaluate
not
only
the
aspects
of
the
case
before
him,
that
is
the
particular
aspects
of
that
case,
but
he
would
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
possibility
of
preserving
enhancement
possibilities
in
future
cases.
i
suggest
that
a
judge
would
in
effect
have
to
have
a
prophecy
to
make
that
determination.
i
think
it
is
quite
possible
even
that
a
conservative
judge
might
appoint
counsel
in
all
cases.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
no,
i
don't
necessarily
believe
it
is
terrible,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
scott.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
then
we
are
back
into
the
arguments
of
--
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
many
states
do.
however,
we
felt
both
in
scott
and
in
this
case
that
counsel
was
not
required
at
this
first
misdemeanor
conviction
as
long
as
incarceration
did
not
result.
therefore,
we
believe
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
could
well
lead
to
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
cases
due
to
either
cautious
judges
or
perhaps
cautious
prosecutors,
a
result
which
this
court
rejected
in
argersinger
and
specifically
in
scott.
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
sentences
that
might
be
involved
here,
the
illinois
supreme
court
noted
at
least
thirty
enhancement
sentences
in
illinois
that
would
be
relevant.
the
amicus
has
done
a
brief
survey
of
those
sentences
around
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
the
federal
system,
and
i
think
we
are
talking
about
more
than
just
a
minor
amount
of
sentences.
thus
there
would
be
substantial
costs
to
the
state
and
to
the
judicial
system,
the
same
types
of
costs
which
a
majority
of
this
court
recognized
in
scott,
and
therefore
chose
not
to
require
counsel
at
misdemeanor
convictions
not
leading
to
imprisonment.
the
instant
sentence
therefore
is
a
direct
result
only
of
a
second
conviction.
it
is
not
a
delayed
or
additional
punishment
for
the
first
uncounseled
conviction.
additionally,
it
is
the
petitioner's
voluntary
act
of
committing
the
second
theft
that
most
directly
led
to
his
incarceration
for
one
to
three
years.
as
to
reliability,
burgett
and
the
later
cases
of
loper
and
united
states
v.
tucker
dealt
with
convictions
which
were
presumptively
void
under
gideon
v.
wainwright.
there
is
no
question
but
that
a
void
conviction
is
clearly
unreliable.
however,
here
the
petitioner
could
have
attacked
his
first
conviction
via
direct
appeal,
a
post-hearing
act,
a
quorum
novis
petition,
or
perhaps
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
fact
that
he
chose
not
to
is
further
indication,
indeed
possibly
a
presumption
of
its
correctness.
the
respondents
believe
that
under
the
facts
presented
herein,
the
counselless
conviction
is
no
less
reliable
from
a
conviction
obtained
after
perhaps
a
waiver
of
counsel
or
a
faretta
situation
where
defendant
insisted
upon
his
personal
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
pardon
me?
mr.
michael
b.
weinstein
yes,
that
would
involve
a
waiver.
i
simply
say
that
in
the
positive
way
because
that
is
the
way
it
was
stated
in
faretta,
where
the
opposite
term,
simply
waiver.
to
insist
that
a
conviction
is
valid
yet
unreliable
simply
does
not
make
any
sense.
in
summary,
your
honors,
the
respondents
believe
that
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
would
only
open
up
a
"pandora's
box"
at
substantial
costs
to
the
criminal
justice
system
and
to
society
in
general.
moreover,
we
believe
that
it
would
completely
abrogate
this
court's
previous
decisions
in
argersinger
and
scott.
therefore,
your
honors,
we
respectfully
urge
that
this
honorable
court
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
illinois
courts.
thank
you.
