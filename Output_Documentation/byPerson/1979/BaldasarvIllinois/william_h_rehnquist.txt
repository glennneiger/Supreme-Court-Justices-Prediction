justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
this
court
has
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
case
is
moot?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
baldasar
a
dentist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
some
illinois
statutes
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
you
were
indicted
for
a
crime,
whether
you
were
convicted
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
question
but
what
the
original
misdemeanor
conviction
which
did
not
result
in
imprisonment
was
proper
under
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
difference
between
this
case
and
burgett,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
reason
you
would
give
for
saying
that
the
uncounseled
conviction
in
this
case
couldn't
be
used
to
enhance
is
that
although
valid
it
was
--
there
was
sufficient
unreliability
about
it,
that
it
shouldn't
be
used.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
was
sufficient
unreliability
because
counsel
wasn't
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
although
valid
it
was
unreliable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
it
is
unreliable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unreliable
to
prevent
its
use
to
enhance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
add
a
cost
to
the
state
if
you
are
going
to
say
that,
sure,
you
can
maintain
this
system
but
you
can't
have
a
recidivist
statute
based
on
it,
or
you
can't
ever
take
that
conviction
into
account
in
a
second
sentencing
of
what
is
clearly
a
felony.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
one
of
the
concerns
of
criminal
justice
experts
in
the
country
now
this
problem
of
the
repeater,
and
isn't
that
why
states
have
responded
with
enhancement
statutes?
