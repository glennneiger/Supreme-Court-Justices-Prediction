it
doesn't
make
the
conviction
--
it
makes
the
conviction
valid,
but
it
doesn't
make
it
any
more
reliable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
still
say
you
could
use
it.

it
sounds
to
me
like
yours
does,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
have
served
a
sentence
that

if
there
had
not
been
a
prior
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens

you
now

mootness
as
we
suggested

you?
