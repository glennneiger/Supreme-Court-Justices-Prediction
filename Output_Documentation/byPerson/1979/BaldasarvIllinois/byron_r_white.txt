has
that
sentence
that
was
actually
imposed
been
served
as
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
feel
that
the
case
is
not
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
there
had
been
a
waiver
of
counsel
at
this
prior
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
prevail
i
suppose
you
would
also
argue
that
in
any
case
like
this,
even
if
there
was
counsel
provided
in
the
prior
misdemeanor
case,
you
should
be
able
to
litigate
whether
counsel
was
adequate
in
the
later
enhancement
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
arguing
reliability.
if
the
reliability
rather
than
a
seemingly
valid
conviction
is
the
test,
i
would
think
you
would
say
this
conviction
is
invalid
because
counsel
was
inadequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
the
parole
period
has
also
expired?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
true
in
the
argersinger
case,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
be
arguing
that
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
not
have
to
argue
that
a
convicted
felon
has
no
interest
in
clearing
his
name?
justice

mr.
weinstein,
on
that
point,
of
course,
he
concedes
it
for
purposes
of
the
fine.
he
doesn't
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
bases
for
imprisonment.
supposing
he
--
as
i
remember
the
facts,
he
was
tried
both
in
dupage
county
and
cook
county.
the
two
misdemeanors
were
in
different
counties.
supposing
the
two
complaints
had
been
filed
close
together
in
point
of
time
and
the
second
complaint
had
already
been
filed
before
he
was
tried
on
the
first
complaint,
so
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record
that
he
was
subject
to
possible
enhancement
if
he
were
found
guilty
on
both
occasions.
in
the
first
trial,
would
there
have
been
a
duty
to
provide
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
but
he
would
still
be
presumptively
innocent,
of
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
if
there
were
a
conviction
on
the
first
complaint
but
before
the
second
complaint
were
tried,
you
couldn't
amend
the
second
complaint
to
add
the
additional
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
do
you
think
the
state
would
be
under
a
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
him
with
counsel
in
the
first
trial,
knowing
that
a
second
misdemeanor
charge
is
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
it
would
still
not
