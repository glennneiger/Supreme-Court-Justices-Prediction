is
there
any
question
about
where
it
was
marked
on
the
ground
at
the
time
of
admission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
any
question
now
where
that
mark
was?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
find
it?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
find
where
the
houghton-ives
line
was?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
question
of
filling
a
gap
rather
than
moving
a
line?
justice
potter
stewart
there
wasn't
any
confusion
about
the
line
was
before
1872,
at
least
that
it
was
marked
on
the
ground,
almost
all
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
there
was
that
mark.
and
what
was
the
occasion
for
putting
it
in
the
different
location,
as
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
had
just
as
accurate
instruments
in
1872
or
1860
as
they
have
got
today,
and
the
same
people
were
doing
the
two
surveys,
would
the
120th
be
in
the
same
place?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
denied
or
admitted
or
what
is
the
position?
is
the
meridian
always
where
it
is
supposed
to
be,
or
is
it
moving?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
an
accurate
survey
were
made
100
years
from
now,
then
the
120th
might
be
in
a
different
place?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
one
more
question.
california
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
in
your
original
complaint
did
you
ask
the
master
to
declare
the
von
schmidt
line
the
correct
line,
or
the
120th
meridian
the
correct
line?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
other
forums
for
settling
these
title
questions,
they
don't
have
to
be
settled
here.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
that?
it
is
just
a
fight
between
the
united
states
and
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
not
against
each
other.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
it
can
be
settled
somewhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
these
proceedings
would
determine
the
title
to
the
united
states
and
that
is
not
a
very
informal
participation
if
you
are
going
to
present
the
united
states
with
a
decree,
is
it?
