mr.
jan
s.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
california's
characterization
of
the
federal
action
in
surveying
the
von
schmidt
line
as
it
is
described
and
delineated
in
the
exhibits
that
we
have
lodged
with
the
court
for
oral
argument
would
be
somewhat
different
from
nevada's.
our
position
is
that
the
federal
government
did
not
in
1872
move
the
boundary
between
california
and
nevada.
rather,
what
the
federal
government
did
was
to
mark
that
boundary
at
a
different
location
and
the
boundary
which
the
federal
government
marked
was
immediately
accepted
by
both
states
and
respected
by
them
in
all
of
their
political
actions
and
jurisdiction
over
since
1872
to
the
present.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
it
was
from
lake
tahoe
north,
certainly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
it
is
our
understanding
that
there
were
substantial
doubts
raised,
primarily
by
the
general
land
office,
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
original
houghton-ives
line.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
to
reflect
the
120th
meridian
on
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
--
on
the
ground,
exactly.
and
also
to
extend
southeasterly
for
approximately
103
miles
south
of
lake
tahoe
the
so-called
oblique
boundary
to
which
justice
stevens
made
reference.
the
extension
of
that
boundary
by
mr.
lawson,
to
which
counsel
has
referred,
was
authorized
unilaterally
by
nevada
and
california
had
no
role
in
either
authorizing
or
approving
it
subsequently.
so
the
houghton-ives
line
insofar
as
it
existed
was
marked
on
the
ground
from
lake
tahoe
to
oregon
and
it
was
marked
on
the
ground
for
approximately
103
miles
southeasterly
from
lake
tahoe.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
72.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
believe
that
it
would
have
been,
your
honor.
and
what
happened
in
fact
is
very
close
to
that.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
well,
whether
it
is
characterized
as
agreement
or
by
acquiescence
--
or
as
acquiescence.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
believe
there
is
a
question
as
to
that,
mr.
justice.
justice
field
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
the
course
of
virginia
v.
tennessee
and
it
was
his
feeling
that
there
were
several
answers
to
that
case,
which
of
course
was
an
acquiescence
case
and
the
same
point
was
raised.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
well,
i
believe
justice
field's
first
point,
at
least,
was
that
in
effect
this
was
not
an
agreement
that
altered
the
political
balance
of
the
states
or
affected
sovereignty
to
such
an
extent
as
to
require
express
congressional
ratification
or
a
compact
within
the
meaning
of
that
clause.
his
second
point
was
that
congressional
approval
can
be
inferred
as
well
as
expressly
given
in
cases
in
which
the
states
have
reach
an
implied
agreement
or
in
which
they
have
acquiesced
upon
a
boundary
for
a
long
period
of
years,
and
that
this
was
a
separate
and
independent
ground
equally
supportive
of
the
position
that
there
was
an
acquiesced
boundary.
we
believe
that
the
same
is
true
here.
the
lines
which
are
in
question
have
been
observed
by
both
states
in
the
north
for
108
years
in
every
respect,
in
political
jurisdiction
school
districts
and
county
lines
have
been
drawn
up
and
they
were
immediately
accepted.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
believe
so,
because
immediately
after
the
new
line
was
drawn
the
general
land
office
directed
that
its
public
surveys
be
redrawn
to
close
upon
the
new
line.
and
subsequently
if
land
title
stability
is
to
be
a
factor
california
received
many
lands
based
in
reliance
upon
the
new
von
schmidt
line.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
so
as
a
matter
of
equity
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
correct,
it
did.
it
patented
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
the
united
states
not
only
expressly
approved
this
new
boundary
line
but
it
subsequently
immediately
took
all
steps
that
were
necessary,
including
the
recognition
for
public
land
purposes
to
recognize
this
as
public
land
within
california.
of
course
it
did
a
lot
of
other
things,
too.
the
post
office
maps
showed
the
new
von
schmidt
line,
the
federal
judicial
districts
reflected
that
line
and
in
every
respect
it
was
recognized
by
the
united
states
as
well
as
both
the
states
ever
since
1872.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
believe
that
is
basically
one
of
the
two
points
that
we
would
believe
militates
for
this
line,
your
honor.
acquiescence,
whether
it
is
characterized
as
acquiescence
or
as
agreement
i
am
not
sure
is
important,
because
we
believe
that
both
are
shown
under
the
facts
here
and
under
the
reasoning
of
justice
field
in
virginia
v.
tennessee.
we
assumed,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
since
nevada
has
not
referred
to
the
alternative
lines
which
it
has
urged
before
the
special
master
that
unless
the
court
desires
us
to
discuss
them
we
will
address
ourselves
primarily
to
the
principal
lines
in
issue,
the
houghton-ives
line
and
the
von
schmidt
line
in
the
north
and
the
coast
&
geodetic
survey
line
on
the
oblique
boundary.
nevada
had
also
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
if
the
120th
meridian
is
to
be
the
boundary
between
nevada
and
california
and
if
the
court
rejects
the
concept
of
acquiescence
or
acceptance
of
the
lines
which
have
been
respected
by
both
the
states
we
believe
that
the
only
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
order
a
new
survey,
as
the
court
did
of
course
in
the
new
mexico
case.
and
such
a
new
survey
could
in
fact
depict
the
120th
meridian
with
a
great
deal
more
certainty
than
the
old
instruments
and
the
poor
conditions
of
100
years
ago
could.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
your
honor,
he
pointed
out,
and
i
think
legitimately,
that
there
is
no
boundary
that
could
be
not
more
precisely
defined
today
than
it
could
have
been
a
hundred
years
ago.
and
this
of
course
is
very
true.
and
this
is
why
our
principal
prayer
is
for
an
acquiesced
boundary
rather
than
through
a
new
survey
by
which
california
would
actually
stand
to
gain
some
rather
significant
land
around
lake
tahoe.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
land
was
very
important
to
people
and
very
little
attention
was
paid
to
it.
some
question
has
been
laid
of
course
to
the
acceptance
of
both
states,
their
readiness
to
accept
a
new
boundary
as
laid
by
the
united
stages
in
1872.
and
perhaps
the
principal
reason
would
be
their
eagerness
to
select
from
the
public
domain
and
to
have
these
lands
go
into
private
hands,
because
as
a
practical
matter
of
course
unless
the
general
land
office
had
a
boundary
that
it
was
happy
with,
it
was
going
to
be
impossible
for
either
california
or
nevada
to
make
selections
of
school
lands
and
other
lands
that
could
in
fact
be
put
into
private
hands.
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pressure
to
do
so
in
those
days.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
your
honor,
it
is
our
belief
that
if
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
the
evidence
before
the
special
master
indicates
that
if
an
accurate
survey
were
made
today,
california's
line
would
extend
anywhere
from
1,200
to
1,700
feet
into
what
is
now
nevada
if
the
north
lake
tahoe
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
am
not
sure
there
would
be
a
significant
difference.
there
have
been
different
data
set
from
time
to
time.
it
is
my
understanding
we
are
on
the
verge
of
getting
another
one.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
believe
in
a
direct
answer
to
your
question
that
there
would
be
a
significant
difference.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
no.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right.
we
believe
that
the
record
amply
supports
the
special
master's
recommendations
with
respect
to
the
location
and
the
acceptance
of
this
line.
the
california-nevada
boundary
was
established
of
course
by
california's
1849
constitution
and
california
has
never
consented
to
a
different
location.
so
the
120th
meridian
must
be
the
description
of
the
california-nevada
boundary.
no
other
description
can
take
its
place.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
actually
i
think
that
the
acquiescence
perhaps
itself
could
only
go
to
the
location
of
that
120th
meridian
on
the
ground.
i
am
not
sure
california
could
acquiesce
for
instance
in
a
different
line
at
the
43rd
meridian
west
of
washington,
which
was
one
of
nevada's
alternative
suggestions,
because
that
is
an
entirely
different
line
from
that
set
forth
in
the
california
constitution.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
might
be
used
to
argue
and
support
such
a
different
location.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
he
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
he
did
come
from
california.
it
was
not
very
valuable
in
those
days.
the
proof
with
respect
to
acceptance
of
this
boundary
by
nevada
is
rather
incontrovertible.
the
nevada
surveyor
general
pointed
out
in
his
1873
report
that
the
federal
government
was
in
the
process
of
surveying
a
new
line,
depicting
the
120th
meridian
and
he
praised
them
for
it.
he
said
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
by
the
munificence
of
the
general
government
within
a
year
the
state
will
be
enclosed
by
an
actual
surveyed
line
and
that
troubles
heretofore
existing
will
be
entirely
and
forever
obviated.
this
was
his
opinion
in
1873.
we
hope
that
his
opinion
will
be
borne
out
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
nevada
state
controller
promptly
directed
the
county
assessors
to
close
their
lines
upon
the
new
boundary.
the
legislature
in
nevada
used
the
new
boundary
to
define
county
boundaries
of
nevada.
and
of
course
the
general
land
office
directed
that
the
public
land
surveys
be
closed
upon
it.
and
ever
since
1872
in
the
north
and
1903
in
the
south
with
respect
to
the
oblique
boundaries
this
has
been
the
case.
there
is
no
dispute
with
respect
to
mutual
observance
by
the
two
states
of
the
boundary
that
is
marked
on
the
ground
and
respected
by
them
today.
and
if
stability
is
to
be
a
factor,
we
would
suggest
that
this
boundary
should
be
put
to
rest
and
ratified,
in
effect,
by
the
court
as
the
accurate
placement
of
this
line.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
the
accurate
description.
now,
the
nevada
constitution
uses
a
dual
description
of
its
western
boundary.
their
constitution
refers
to
the
43rd
meridian
west
of
washington
and
the
eastern
boundary
of
california.
but
it
has
been
our
position
that
the
facts
before
the
special
master
pretty
well
showed
that
it
was
believed
in
those
days
the
43rd
meridian
west
of
washington
was
synonymous
with
the
120th
meridian
west
of
greenwich.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
no,
there
is
not,
this
is
solely
between
california
and
nevada.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
there
were
two
principal
factors,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
it
has
been
discovered
from
time
to
time
and
more
lately,
very
recently
that
the
location
of
the
boundary
was
not
an
accurate
depiction
of
the
120th
meridian.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
von
schmidt
was
about
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
so
it
is
not
an
accurate
depiction
of
the
120th
meridian
and
there
was
some
fear
that
taxes
and
criminal
prosecutions
and
acts
of
the
like
could
be
challenged
on
the
basis
that
in
fact
the
california-nevada
boundary
as
set
forth
in
law
was
not
being
followed
by
the
states.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
in
the
nature
of
one,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
of
course
the
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
the
second
concern
that
came
to
our
attention
was
a
ruling
of
the
department
of
the
interior
which
seemed
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
validity
of
titles
which
were
granted
in
reliance
upon
the
old
replaced
boundary,
the
von
schmidt
boundary.
in
effect,
the
department
of
the
interior
has
held
that
a
school
land
selection
initially
made
in
california
and
approved
by
the
department
of
the
interior
at
that
time
clear
listed,
in
effect,
but
subsequently
found
to
be
located
actually
in
nevada
remained
public
lands,
notwithstanding
the
usual
line
of
authority
that
once
a
survey
is
approved
by
the
federal
government
of
a
selection
made
by
a
state,
then
the
title
has
passed
to
the
state
or
the
persons
who
take
under
the
state.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
to
homestead,
to
internal
improvement
lands
and
to
school
lands.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
would
hope
that
that
would
be
the
position.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
it
has.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
very
recently,
in
the
1960's.
and
our
concern
is
that
the
stability
of
titles
be
treated
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests
in
further
proceedings
before
the
special
master,
because
in
the
absence
of
this
affirmative
interior
decision
we
think
that
there
would
be
very
little
difficultly
in
confirming
the
present
boundary
in
its
present
place.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
yes,
it
would
involve
nevada,
your
honor,
because
nevada
has
made
a
substantial
number
of
selections,
the
validity
of
which
could
be
cast
into
doubt
by
the
decision
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
they
could,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
believe
that
they
would
be
properly
before
this
court.
they
could
intervene
because
there
is
a
question
of
possible
u.s.
title
involved
here.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
and
i
would
agree
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
the
united
states
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
right.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right.
to
pursue
this
question,
however,
they
have
volunteered
to
participate
in
further
proceedings.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
a
feasible
way
of
coping
with
the
problems
that
have
come
to
earth
respecting
these
titles.
perhaps
the
united
states
can
disclaim
any
interest
in
the
patents
that
have
been
made
pursuant
to
this
old
boundary.
this
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
perhaps
legislation
passed
by
the
two
states
and
by
congress
can
solve
it
and
perhaps
this
court
can
offer
some
further
relief,
thereby
settling
all
problems
which
have
arisen
from
the
california-nevada
boundary.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
asked
that
the
von
schmidt
line
be
declared
to
be
the
accurate
one,
your
honor,
it
was
basically
in
the
nature
of
a
quiet
title
as
has
been
suggested.
when
alternative
lines
were
suggested
by
nevada,
we
felt
it
necessary
to
request
an
alternative
survey
of
our
own
because
if
the
entire
location
of
the
line
was
to
be
questioned
to
such
extent,
we
felt
that
an
accurate
survey
should
be
thrown
in
as
an
alternative
to
quieting,
in
effect,
the
present
line.
the
oblique
boundary
of
course
we
have
referred
to
surveyed
somewhat
later
than
the
north-south
boundary.
it
was
surveyed
from
1893
to
1899
by
the
coast
&
geodetic
survey.
and
it
replaced
the
von
schmidt
line
which
is
the
only
line
that
entirely
surveyed
the
oblique
boundary
from
lake
tahoe
to
the
colorado
river.
once
again,
we
feel
that
this
is
clearly
an
accepted
and
an
acquiesced
boundary
and
the
evidence
is
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
its
acceptance
by
the
states,
with
two
exceptions.
one,
the
period
of
acquiescence
is
somewhat
shorter,
it
is
80
years
rather
than
108
years
as
it
is
in
the
north.
and
the
second
thing
in
that
this
line
was
recognized
not
only
in
fact
but
in
statute
by
both
the
states.
both
states
passed
in
1901
and
1903
statutes
expressly
recognizing
the
fact
the
coast
&
geodetic
line
delineated
their
boundaries.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
we
have
no
problem
as
to
the
point.
now,
in
the
oblique
boundary,
just
by
way
of
passing,
nevada
gained
256
square
miles
but
california
nevertheless
recognized
that
boundary
initially
and
we
feel
it
deserves
equal
recognition
in
this
case.
we
have
indicated
that
we
feel
there
is
clearly
authority
for
a
new
survey
if
it
is
necessary.
and
oklahoma
v.
texas
represents
good
authority
to
that
effect.
in
that
case
the
line
proposed
by
texas
had
been
rejected
on
the
grounds
that
it
wasn't
properly
authorized;
the
line
proposed
by
oklahoma
was
rejected
on
the
grounds
evidence
of
acquiescence
was
insufficient.
and
the
court
felt
that
the
proper
remedy
in
that
case
was
to
direct
a
new
survey
to
be
made.
we
have
touched
on
the
question
of
titles
but
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
touch
on
it
at
length
in
this
proceeding,
because
what
is
before
the
court
directly
of
course
is
the
location
of
the
boundary
between
california
and
nevada.
we
do
suggest
that
the
special
master
and
the
united
states
have
both
properly
recommended
that
this
question
be
referred
to
further
proceedings,
because
we
believe
that
solutions
are
possible.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
no,
only
to
the
extent
that
the
special
master
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
certainly
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
assume
it
would.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
have
filed
a
motion,
your
honor,
for
the
commission
to
file
an
amended
complaint
which
expressly
raises
this
question.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
and
you
have
not
acted
on
that.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
the
special
master
initially
recommended
in
its
preliminary
report
that
it
would
be
advantageous
to
the
parties
and
the
court
to
resolve
all
known
disputes
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
joint
common
boundaries
and
that
piecemeal
litigation
should
be
avoided.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
your
honor,
they
may
have
to
be.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
the
controversy
may
involve
both
states
and
the
united
states.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
know
of
no
direct
instance
in
which
both
states
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
to
select
the
same
parcel.
it
is
possible
that
it
could
but
since
all
three
parties
have
interests
in
the
lands
affected,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
properly
suggested
that
it
may
be
that
we
will
have
to
seek
resolution
in
this
court.
it
is
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
only
that
further
proceedings
be
had
with
respect
to
this
question
and
the
solicitor
general
has
recommended
only
that
such
proceedings
take
place
without
the
actual
joinder
of
the
united
states
and
possibly
without
the
necessity
of
further
action
here.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
by
agreement,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
referring
to
resolution
of
the
question
of
titles?
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
would
have
every
hope
that
we
--
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
we
can't
speak
for
them,
really.
there
is
precedent
of
course
for
such
a
proceeding.
in
the
last
case,
oklahoma
v.
louisiana,
which
this
special
master
presided
over
the
question
to
possible
unites
states
title
to
an
island,
an
island
named
sam,
the
state
line
river
as
i
recall,
came
up
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
and
it
was
determined
that
a
further
determination
was
necessary
to
resolve
the
entire
border
controversy
to
ascertain
what
u.s.
interests
may
be
in
that
island.
florida
v.
georgia
of
course
is
the
best
and
most
apropos
precedent
for
such
a
thing.
in
that
case
the
united
states
attorney
general
actively
applied
for
leave
to
intervene
in
a
boundary
dispute
between
two
states
on
the
basis
that
millions
of
acres
had
been
alienated
by
the
united
states
in
what
it
then
believed
to
be
florida
but
georgia
was
contending
to
be
georgia
and
that
therefore
the
united
states
had
a
real
interest
to
its
grantees
in
participating
in
the
proceeding
and
helping
to
assist
the
court
in
ascertaining
the
propriety
both
of
the
boundary
and
the
consequences
of
that
boundary
determination,
the
status
of
lands
within
the
affected
states.
it
was
the
duty
to
see
the
case
was
fully
and
well
briefed,
he
argued,
and
the
united
states
had
a
general
interest
in
state
boundaries
because
of
political
considerations.
well,
in
that
case
justice
tawney
granted
leave
for
the
united
states
to
intervene
informally,
as
it
was
characterized
at
that
time,
and
to
present
evidence
and
to
participate
but
not
to
be
granted
leave
as
a
formal
party.
and
perhaps
this
resembles
what
the
special
master
has
recommended
in
this
case,
that
the
united
states
offer
to
participate
with
nevada
and
california
to
help
clear
up
this
last
remaining
question
which
has
been
caused
by
these
old
boundaries.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white,
and
it
may
be
necessary
that
they
join
formally
at
a
later
time.
they
have
deferred
presentation
of
their
views
and
simply
asked
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
participate
informally
until
resolution
can
be
had.
basically,
then,
our
position
has
been
that
the
boundary
question
is
one
which
is
capable
of
easy
resolution.
it
does
not
represent
a
case
of
the
unconstitutional
transfer
of
a
boundary
from
one
jurisdiction
to
another.
rather,
it
involves
the
location
of
a
boundary
in
the
ground
which
was
accepted
immediately
by
both
states
and
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
residents
of
those
states
for
over
100
years
in
one
case
and
for
80
years
in
the
other.
the
cases
we
think
clearly
support
the
special
master's
recommendation
in
that
case
that
the
boundary
be
settled
where
it
has
been
and
where
we
relied
upon
it.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
it
is
very
close
to
that,
your
honor,
if
not
precisely
that.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
the
difference
is
that
there
was
a
line
and
the
states
have
accepted
it.
and
the
federal
government
came
along
and
marked
a
new
line
and
the
states
promptly
accepted
that
line
and
they
have
done
so
ever
since.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
that
is
right,
that
is
correct.
the
120th
meridian
is
we
think
beyond
doubt
the
proper
constitutional
boundary
between
the
states.
and
for
that
reason
we
haven't
gone
into
the
alternative
line
suggested
by
nevada.
we
believe
that
the
location
which
we
have
respected
for
all
this
time
should
be
affirmed
at
this
time.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
nevada's
alternative
being
the
43rd
west
of
d.c.
and
nevada's
second
alternative
being
another
line
altogether
drawn
from
a
different
location
at
oregon
border,
which
was
represented
as
being
the
120th.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
your
honor,
we
believe
it
originally
was
in
the
white
house
and
it
was
subsequently
moved
to
the
old
naval
observatory
and
then
to
the
new
naval
observatory.
and
the
one
to
which
the
act
of
congress
of
september
29,
1850
referred
to
is
not
entirely
clear
to
us
but
in
any
event
it
would
be
approximately
2-1/2
miles
farther
west
into
california.
mr.
jan
s.
stevens
it
is
involved,
your
honor.
thank
you.
