justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
if
we
adopt
the
special
master's
report
and
if
you
take
the
special
master's
--
it
includes,
what,
5,000
acres
of
land
or
so,
that
the
united
states
purported
to
give
to
nevada?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
land
that
the
united
states
purported
to
give
to
nevada
and
nevada
purported
to
convey
to
settlers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
those
titles
resting
in
the
change
from
u.s.
to
nevada
to
owners,
that
land
will
now
be
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
what
is
your
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
interest,
is
it
just
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
land
is
in
nevada
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
isn't
anything
like
oil
or
minerals
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
taxes,
or
anything.
it
is
just
sovereignty.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
present
landowners
have
to
get
their
title
quieted
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
of
the
diagonal
line
as
well
as
the
north-south
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
record
indicate
why
the
von
schmidt
survey
was
ever
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can
you
say
that
neither
one
of
them
gained
or
lost
territory
if
the
line
is
not
in
fact
on
the
120th
meridian?
wherever
you
put
it,
somebody
had
to
lose
if
it
was
erroneous.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
there
were
more
perfect
methods
of
measuring
those
--
ascertaining
those
lines
now
than
existed
a
hundred
years
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
best
available
modern
technology
that
we
would
find
the
very
first
time
they
drew
the
line
on
the
ground
they
made
some
mistakes
and
they
therefore
took
territory
from
one
state
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
contend
that
is
what
should
be
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
united
states,
though,
based
on
the
old
line
conveyed
in
nevada
some
land
that
was
--
you
claim
was
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
infer
united
states
acquiescence
or
approval
of
that
agreement
of
moving
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
upon
the
subsequent
line,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise
it
would
have
been
in
nevada,
under
the
old
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
about
nevada,
but
at
least
i
take
it
that
judge
van
pelt
was
not
particularly
enthusiastic
about
this,
he
offered
it
as
an
alternative.
justice
byron
r.
white
houghton-ives
wasn't
and
neither
was
von
schmidt.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
inaccurate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
quiet
title
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
other
thing
that
precipitated
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
necessary
party
indispensable
to
settle
your
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
you
could
go
ahead
and
impede
the
united
states
in
this
case.
certainly
you
couldn't
against
its
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
never
referred
to
him
any
issue
about
titles.
you
have
just
referred
to
him
the
dispute
between
the
two
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
would
have
to
expand
his
reference,
wouldn't
we,
if
he
was
going
to
go
on
and
do
something
besides
what
he
has
done
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
we
haven't
acted
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
the
absence
of
that,
we
would
have
to
simply
resolve
the
issue
of
the
boundary
line
and
if
this
special
master
went
beyond
the
reference
to
suggest
private
title
litigation,
a
decree
reflecting
that
recommendation
would
probably
be
beyond
the
reference,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
time
thinking
that
they
were
locating
the
120th
meridian?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
alternative
line
being
the
43rd
west
of
d.c.?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
the
understanding
that
the
43rd
was
the
same
as
the
120th?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
was
it
recognized
they
were
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
was
the
eastern
boundary
--
the
eastern
boundary
of
california
wasn't
the
43rd,
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
territory
of
nevada
was
created
right
up
against
it.
