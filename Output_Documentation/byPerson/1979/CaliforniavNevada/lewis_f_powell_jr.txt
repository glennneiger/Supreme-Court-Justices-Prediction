the
special
master's
report
wouldn't
have
any
impact
on
private
titles,
would
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
if
we
accept
the
special
master
it
wouldn't
have
any
impact
on
the
private
titles?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
must
confess
i
really
don't
understand
the
argument.
if
the
claim
of
right
of
california
is
it
owns
up
--
it
has
sovereignty
up
to
the
120th
meridian
and
if
they
thought
they
were
claiming
land
up
to
the
120th
meridian,
does
it
matter
whether
the
survey
was
done
by
a
private
person
who
was
misinformed
or
the
united
states
government
or
is
california
or
nevada
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

the
acquiescence
cannot
move
it
even
though
the
parties
believe
that
is
where
it
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
under
later
surveys
it
was
put
in
another
place.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
diagonal
line.
masters
said
that
the
houghton-ives
survey
extended
from
the
oregon
border
to
approximately
103
miles
southeast
of
the
intersection
in
lake
tahoe.
it
was
not
continued
to
the
colorado
river
and
therefore
approximately
302
miles
of
the
oblique
boundary
were
left
unmarked
and
unsurveyed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
correct
that
part
of
the
boundary
had
not
been
marked?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
then,
how
can
you
say
it
was
all
on
the
ground?
it
wasn't.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
your
argument
does
not
apply
to
the
southeasterly
part
of
the
southeasterly
line?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
at
least
as
to
that
you
would
have
to
perhaps
assume
that
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence
would
apply.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
think
it
is
just
as
though
there
was
a
dispute
at
the
time
about
where
the
boundary
was,
that
it
had
never
been
marked
on
the
ground
definitely
and
people
were
in
a
big
argument
about
where
it
was
and
so
the
two
states
agreed
to
have
a
survey.
so
it
is
marked
on
the
ground
and
they
both
then
accept
it.
you
think
the
situation
is
just
like
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
only
thing
is
that
there
was
a
line
on
the
ground.
