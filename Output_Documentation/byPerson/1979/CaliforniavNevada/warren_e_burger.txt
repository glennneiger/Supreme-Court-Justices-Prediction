we
will
hear
arguments
next
this
afternoon
in
the
state
of
california
v.
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
thompson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

justice

mr.
stevens.
chief

e.
burger
that
is
where
you
say
the
united
states
acquiesced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
fair
to
say
that
california
in
this
case
depends
upon
treating
acquiescence
in
the
same
way
and
having
the
same
consequences
as
an
affirmative
agreement,
an
affirmative
express
agreement
on
the
boundary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
neither
of
you
is
very
enthusiastic
about
a
brand
new
survey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
when
this
description
was
originally
agreed
upon
that
people
knew
it
would
end
up
in
the
middle
of
lake
tahoe,
the
meeting
of
the
two
lines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
field
didn't
know
how
valuable
land
around
lake
tahoe
was
going
to
be
in
the
20th
century,
did
he?
chief
justice

to
homestead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
dispute
just
between
california
and
the
united
states;
it
doesn't
involve
nevada,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
--
how
would
that
dispute
be
resolved
in
this
case?
how
could
you
get
the
united
states
into
this
suit;
could
they
intervene?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
solicitor
general
has
got
power
to
waive
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
did
nothing
else
that
would
mean
we
acquiesced
in
the
master's
recommendation
that
you
continue
this
process,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
were
to
grant
your
motion
for
the
amended
complaint,
do
we
know
now
whether
nevada
will
be
in
agreement
with
that,
assuming
we
go
with
you
on
the
main
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
know
that
now.
perhaps
nevada
is
not
prepared
to
respond,
but
we
will
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
thompson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
