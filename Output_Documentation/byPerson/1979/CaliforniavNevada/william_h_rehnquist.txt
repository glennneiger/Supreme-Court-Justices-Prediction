justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
acquiescence
is
inapplicable
here
and
your
reason
for
it
is
that
it
is
the
united
states
that
made
the
mistake?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
acquiescence
any
less
persuasive
in
a
situation
like
that
than
where
it
simply
drafts
a
wrong
decision
of
this
court
or
a
mistaken
decision
of
this
court
or
a
mistake
in
a
surveyor's
note?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
the
acquiescence
principle
come
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least
you
can't
acquiesce
if
the
boundary
is
marked
on
the
ground.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
arkansas
v.
tennessee,
i
think
it
was
chief
justice
hughes'
opinion
and
in
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
opinion,
certainly
the
acquiescence
principle
was
applied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
pollard,
this
court
ultimately
held
that
congress
had
no
right
to
admit
the
state
of
mississippi
or
alabama,
whichever
it
was,
the
way
it
did
because
it
had
a
right
to
be
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
state,
supposing
that
for
90
years
each
of
the
states
had
acquiesced
in
the
boundaries
set
by
the
united
states
at
the
time
it
admitted
the
state
of
missisippi,
do
you
think
acquiescence
would
have
been
out
of
place
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
admitting
the
state
to
the
union
prescribed
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
the
critical
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
critical
aspect
of
the
acquiescence
doctrine
is
the
fact
the
boundary
has
been
marked
on
the
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
metes
and
bounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
still
identify
the
calls?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
surveyor's
notes
extant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
was
it
within
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
do
that
at
that
time,
since
both
california
and
nevada
had
been
admitted
to
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
after
two
states
have
been
admitted
to
the
union
by
an
act
of
congress
that
the
united
states
geological
survey
can
come
along
and
run
a
survey
line
that
doesn't
comport
to
the
act
of
congress
and
that
then
becomes
the
boundary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happens
in
a
case
of
land
that
is
still
territory.
say
in
1864
when
the
territory
of
new
mexico
included
both
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
president
lincoln
severed
arizona
and
made
it
a
territory
in
its
own
right.
was
that
done
by
a
survey
or
by
an
act
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
nevada
was
carved
out
of
utah
its
western
boundary
was
specifically
made
the
eastern
boundary
of
california.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
two
known
lines
on
the
ground
that
didn't
jibe.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
supposed
to
be
what,
to
reflect
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
the
two
states
in
18
--
when
was
it
--
von
schmidt
--
'72?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
the
two
states
had
got
together
and
said,
gee,
i
think
it
is
probably
a
mistake,
they
used
this
mark
on
the
ground
and
that
is
where
it
was
when
nevada
was
admitted
and
that
is
the
line
that
both
the
legislatures
accepted
at
the
time
of
nevada's
admission,
anyway.
didn't
they
accept
the
line
as
it
was
marked
on
the
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
they
had
said
then,
well,
we
want
to
change
it,
we
want
to
change
our
boundary.
and
so
they
signed
up
an
agreement.
would
that
have
been
a
valid
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
you
must
have
to
argue
that,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
that
have
required
the
consent
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
my
example,
what
is
the
argument
they
wouldn't
have
had
the
consent
of
congress
if
the
two
states
wanted
to
change
their
boundary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
california
received
new
lands.
you
mean
in
the
sense
of
political
jurisdiction
or
in
the
sense
of
ownership
of
school
lands
and
that
type
of
thing?
the
united
states
patented
lands
in
california
based
on
the
von
schmidt
line.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
based
on
corrections
on
the
ground
conforming
to
an
abstract
description.
it
remains
constant,
though,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
not
supposed
to
be.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
an
accepted
notion
that
meridians
are
traveling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
there
has
been
acquiescence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
justice
field's
comment
in
the
old
indiana
case
that
it
wouldn't
significantly
alter
the
balance
of
power
between
the
states
as
a
ground
for
allowing
acquiescence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
nevada
has
no
western
boundary
except
the
eastern
boundary
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
other
state
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precipitated
this
dispute;
i
mean
why
are
you
all
jerc
if
you
have
been
so
happy
all
these
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
von
schmidt
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
i
thought
you
argued
a
moment
ago
that
the
interior
department
has
made
some
nonacquiescence
acts
recently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly
in
the
recent
case
that
we
wrote
in
idaho
v.
washington
and
oregon,
we
held
that
even
though
perhaps
only
political
sovereignty
was
involved,
the
united
states
was
not
an
indispensable
party
and
its
intervention
was
not
required,
didn't
we.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
both
nevada
and
california
recognize
the
act
of
congress
in
the
'sixties
as
making
the
canalized
colorado
river
the
boundary
where
california
and
nevada
have
joint
boundaries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least
you
don't
say
that
the
real
boundary
was
contained
in
the
conference
report.
