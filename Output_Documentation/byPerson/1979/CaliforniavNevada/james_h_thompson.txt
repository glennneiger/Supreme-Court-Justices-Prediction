mr.
james
h.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
nevada
submits
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
california
and
nevada
in
1863
constitutionally
set
their
joint
state
boundary.
nevada
submits
that
they
did.
the
second
question
is
assuming
that
boundary
was
constitutionally
set,
that
the
united
states,
whether
they
had
the
power
to
move
it
onto
a
new
land.
nevada
submits
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
this
power
under
the
constitution.
nevada
does
concede
that
if
this
were
a
proper
case
for
application
of
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence
that
nevada
has
acquiesced
in
the
present
marked
lines,
the
lines
recommended
by
the
master.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence,
because
to
apply
the
doctrine
in
this
case
would
confer
upon
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
the
power
to
act
upon
state
boundaries.
and
this
court
in
rhode
island
v.
massachusetts
many
years
ago
said.
"there
can
be
but
two
tribunals
under
the
constitution
who
can
act
on
the
boundaries
of
states,
the
legislative
or
the
judicial
power,
the
former
is
limited,
in
express
terms,
to
assent
or
dissent,
where
a
compact
or
agreement
is
referred
to
them"
--
meaning
congress.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
united
states
had
no
power
to
move
the
boundary
under
the
constitution.
therefore
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
we
contend
that
the
failure
of
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
move
the
boundary
goes
to
california's
claim
of
right
in
which
acquiescence
has
always
been
applied
on
the
claim
of
right
in
the
state.
in
all
the
boundary
decisions
of
this
court
there
has
always
been
an
enabling
act
or
something
of
that
nature,
a
concession
from
virginia
to
the
united
states,
a
monument
of
title,
a
color
of
title.
and
california,
we
contend,
does
not
have
that
because
they
claim
the
united
states
has
wrongfully
moved,
taken
part
of
nevada
and
given
it
to
california.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
it
is
approximately
218
square
miles.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
forty-six
hundred
acres,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
that
land
would
be
in
california
by
the
master's
decree.
but
concurrently
with
that,
california
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
interest
in
those
patents?
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
territorial
sovereignty,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
there
is
some
question
by
california
as
to
the
legality
of
those
private
titles.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir.
nevada
still
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
territorial
sovereignty,
the
political
integrity
of
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
i
don't
think
it
does,
particularly
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
not
according
to
nevada.
california
and
the
united
states
have
some
question
about
it
but
i
could
find
no
parcel
of
land
patented
by
both
states,
such
as
you
had
in
coffee
v.
groover
or
poole
v.
fleeger.
i
haven't
found
any
parcel.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
well,
if
the
special
master's
line
is
decreed,
this
court
i
remember
in
maryland
v.
west
virginia
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
law-making
bodies
of
those
two
states
to
enact
legislation
validating
the
new
found
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
he
has
made
a
recommendation
that
california
be
permitted
to
file
an
amended
complaint
in
which
the
matter
of
titles
and
certain
claims
will
be
asserted
against
the
united
states
by
california.
i
think
mr.
stevens
will
go
into
that.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir.
we
are
strictly
concerned
with
the
movement
of
part
of
our
territory
to
the
state
of
california.
congress
can
act,
they
can
prescribe
a
boundary,
they
can
establish
it,
they
can
set
it.
but
once
it
is
done,
they
can't
move
an
established
boundary.
so
you
are
back
to
the
question
did
the
joint
survey
establish
the
boundary
between
california
and
nevada.
and,
if
it
did,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
united
states
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
go
out
there
and
physically
move
it,
to
give
part
of
nevada,
a
significant
portion
of
territory
to
california.
so
the
dispositive
question
really
to
be
answered
and
indeed
to
be
faced,
because
california
won't
face
it,
the
special
master
did
not
face
it,
is
did
the
federal
government
act
under
a
power
under
the
constitution
when
it
moved
the
posted
boundary.
and
that
question
has
not
been
addressed
and
we
submit
that
it
has
to
be
looked
at
and
answered,
you
just
can't
go
on
acquiescence,
because
there
is
no
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
if
it
is
first
set
on
the
ground
and
marked,
that
is
the
boundary.
under
the
constitution
you
would
then
have
to
go
to
the
compact
clause
to
move
it
or
by
suit
in
this
court.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
because
the
actual
moving
was
without
constitutional
authority
and
california's
title
is
only
so
good
as
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
that
territory.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
the
special
master
in
california
urged
it
was
a
simple
case
of
acquiescence,
like
any
other
boundary.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
we
cannot
acquiesce
and
avoid
a
constitutional
act.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
in
every
case
before
this
it
was
correctly
applied,
there
was
a
claim
with
color
of
title
in
every
case.
it
stated
in
there
that
kentucky
succeeded
to
the
ancient
right
and
possession
of
virginia.
there
was
a
color
of
title.
california
is
trying
to
take
advantage
of
an
unconstitutional
void
act
and
say
we
have
got
a
valid
claim
to
it.
and,
as
i
say,
the
question
has
not
been
addressed.
we
tried
to
address
it
and
we
have
raised
it
and
for
the
first
time
i
have
someone
who
is
listening
to
it.
if
the
united
states
did
act
under
the
constitution,
it
did
have
this
power
to
set
the
boundary,
then
the
decision
of
this
court
should
rest
upon
the
holding
to
that
effect,
that
it
was
pursuant
to
a
constitutional
power
and
not
upon
acquiescence.
because
we
can't
acquiesce
and
avoid
an
act.
and
this
court
on
several
occasions
has
held
that
the
state
cannot
confer
on
the
united
states
a
absent
power.
chief
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
v.
maryland
said
"these
powers
(of
the
united
states)
are
not
given
by
the
people
of
a
single
state.
they
are
given
by
the
people
of
the
united
states.
consequently,
the
people
of
a
single
state
cannot
confer
a
sovereignty
which
will
extend
over
(the
people
of
the
united
states)because
it
is
the
usurpation
of
a
power
which
the
people
of
a
single
state
cannot
give."
and
nevada
cannot
by
acquiescence,
silent
submission,
constitutionalize
the
usurpation
of
a
power.
another
case,
pennsylvania
v.
wheeling
bridge,
there
was
question
whether
a
compact
between
two
states
and
which
congress
had
consented
to
could
offer
a
restriction
upon
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
said,
clearly
not.
otherwise
congress
and
two
states
would
possess
the
power
to
modify
and
alter
the
constitution
itself.
there
are
three
other
decisions
of
this
court,
morley
v.
first
municipality,
coyle
v.
smith
and
pollard
v.
hagan
that
all
said
the
same
thing.
the
special
master
said
this
was
a
novel
argument.
it
isn't.
it
goes
back
to
chief
justice
marshall.
he
calls
it
a
novel
argument.
we
submit
he
could
not
have
been
more
wrong.
clearly
then,
since
a
state
cannot
directly
--
as
these
decisions
say
--
cannot
directly
alter
the
constitution,
how
could
nevada
ever
do
it
by
--
indirectly
by
acquiescence?
it
can't,
it
can't
be
done.
not
under
the
past
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
i
think
it
would
have
been
applied
there
if
there
was
a
survey
on
the
ground
at
the
time
of
the
admission.
they
were
bound
to
observe
that
boundary.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
prescribed
the
boundary.
it
had
not
been
set
on
the
ground.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
the
united
states
would
have
been
free
to
go
out
there
and
set
it.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir.
and
if
the
power
was
exhausted,
then
to
change
it
except
by
the
compact
clause
of
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
except
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
every
time
they
would
go
out
and
survey
it,
they
would
move
it.
no
one
has
ever
agreed
on
where
it
is.
this
court
has
always
preferred
stability
of
location
over
stability
of
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
it
was
marked
on
the
ground
at
time
of
admission.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
there
isn't.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes
sri.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
there
is
testimony
in
another
case
that
it
can
be
reestablished.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
patents
were
issued
by
the
united
states
with
relation
to
both
the
diagonal
and
the
meridional
boundary
and
you
can
go
to
the
united
states'
own
records
in
the
blm
land
office
and
they
are
by
metes
and
bounds
description.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
in
the
evidence
there
is
township
plats
for
six
townships,
running
from
lake
tahoe
north
about
25
miles
and
there
are
some
chains
and
links,
the
nevada-california
boundary
line.
and
the
patents
were
issued
in
relation
to
that
line
on
either
side.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes
sir.
i
will
put
everything
in
evidence
for
those
six
townships
where
it
is
heavily
populated
by
western
standards.
those
are
in
evidence.
what
california
is
actually
asking
this
court
when
she
requests
the
court
to
hold
that
acquiescence
is
controlling,
is
for
the
court
to
apply
the
equitable
doctrine
of
acquiescence
so
as
to
alter
the
constitution,
the
organic
law
of
the
land.
and
chief
justice
marshall
again
put
to
rest
any
notion
that
the
constitution
would
be
changed
by
ordinary
means
in
marbury
v.
madison.
there
he
said.
"the
constitution
is
either
a
superior
paramount
law
unchangeable
by
ordinary
means
or
is
on
the
level
with
ordinary
legislative
acts.
and
if
the
latter
part
be
true,
then
written
constitutions
are
absurd
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
limit
a
power
of
its
own
nature
illimitable."
i
would
submit
that
the
constitution
is
not
an
equitable
document.
it
is
a
legal
document
setting
forth
relations
of
the
states
between
each
other,
or
among
each
other,
among
the
states
vis-a-vis
the
federal
government.
and
those
legal
constitutional
relationship
cannot
be
changed
by
the
application
of
equitable
doctrine
normally
applied
between
two
private
citizens.
i
would
like
now
to
talk
about
the
joint
state
survey,
the
houghton-ives
line.
california
by
statute
prescribed
that
they
would
use
in
this
joint
survey
two
terminal
points
set
by
lt.
j.
c.
ives,
not
to
be
confused
with
butler
ives.
these
points
were
established
at
the
colorado
river
and
the
35th
parallel
and
at
lake
tahoe.
and
they
prescribed
that
these
would
be
used
and
they
were
set
by
the
united
states
boundary
commission
in
1861.
so
two
years
later
the
survey
is
run.
it
is
a
complete
survey
of
the
120th
meridian
and
it
was
surveyed
along
the
lake
boundary
for
about
102
miles
and
the
following
year
california
appropriated
money
to
put
a
permanent
marker
at
terminal
point
so
as
"to
enable
the
survey
to
be
continued
from
that
point
at
some
future
time."
that
monument
was
put
up.
the
following
year,
in
1875,
lawson,
who
also
participated
in
the
other
survey,
lawson
extended
the
survey
another
73
miles,
acting
as
a
joint
commissioner
for
both
states.
so
you
have
to
remember
at
that
time
the
nevada
boundary
with
california
only
went
as
far
as
the
37th
parallel,
it
did
not
go
to
the
colorado
river.
so
that
joint
boundary
was
surveyed
within
a
few
miles
of
the
37th
parallel
by
lawson's
terminal
monument.
so
the
states
when
they
accepted
it,
they
said,
we
accept
that
survey,
it
is
the
official
boundary
so
far
as
it
has
been
run.
so
they
knew
it
was
incomplete.
it
hadn't
been
run
all
the
way
to
the
colorado
river.
they
accepted
it
the
way
it
was.
and
incomplete
surveys
are
not
unusual
at
all.
the
united
states
government
has
surveyed
many
a
state
boundary
by
piecemeal
surveys.
probably
the
longest
one
is
the
majors
darling-preston
line
by
three
different
surveyors
on
the
37th
parallel
between
new
mexico
territory
and
colorado.
so
it
is
not
unusual
to
do
it
in
piecemeal
fashion.
and
general
houghton,
who
was
california's
commissioner
of
the
joint
survey,
reported
to
the
legislature
that,
we
have
marked
on
the
oblique
boundary
the
important
part
to
be
marked
at
this
time.
i
don't
think
there
were
any
settlements
along
there.
at
this
time
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
have
gone
out
there
at
that
terminal
monument,
close
the
public
land
surveys,
and
extend
lawson's
terminal
monument
on
to
the
colorado
river,
fill
in
that
gap.
they
would
have
plenty
of
power
to
do
that.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
the
united
states
government
surveyed
many
state
boundaries
which
turned
out
to
be
state
boundaries;
our
northern
boundary
with
idaho
was
surveyed
by
the
united
states.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
saying
that
the
states
can
set
it
the
first
time
or
the
united
states
can
set
it
the
first
time.
since
the
states
actually
ran
the
survey,
that
fixed
it.
but
there
was
still
a
gap
in
it
and
the
united
states
certainly
had
an
interest
in
continuing
that
line
so
they
could
close
the
public
land
surveys;
but,
they
didn't
do
that.california
has
never
argued
that
the
houghton-ives
line
did
not
set
the
boundary.
they
said
but
it
was
only
observed
for
ten
years.
of
course
it
was
ten
years,
because
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
1864,
your
honor.
of
course
it
was
only
there
for
ten
years
because
the
united
states
had
picked
up
the
monuments,
they
were
gone.
they
sent
them
over
to
von
schmidt's
line.
california
would
have
you
believe
that
for
some
period
of
time,
unspecified,
at
which
a
state's
right
to
rely
on
its
boundary
becomes
vested
and
prior
thereto
it
is
subject
to
being
divested.
that
is
sheer
nonsense.
nevada
submits
that
the
two
states
acquired
a
vested
boundary
the
very
day
they
adopted
the
joint
state
houghton-ives
line
posted
it.
california
complains,
but
the
federal
government
never
formally
approved
th
houghton
line,
as
though
there
were
some
requirement,
perhaps
by
congress,
i
don't
know,
to
officially
proclaim
a
survey
as
the
boundary.
there
is
no
such
requirement.
outside
of
congress'
approval
of
a
line
between
texas
and
the
united
states
territory
and
also
the
carpenter
survey
between
new
mexico
and
colorado,
i
don't
know
if
they
have
ever
formally
approved
any
survey.
what
happens
is
that
if
they
like
a
survey,
if
it
is
run,
the
general
land
office
closes
the
public
land
surveys
on
that
land.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
they
were
all
done
by
surveys
through
appropriation
acts
by
congress.
and
the
general
land
office
would
hire
surveyors.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
that
is
right;
yes,
sir.
but
the
united
states
surveys
the
boundaries
and
usually
they
were
always
between
two
territories
of
the
united
states.
or,
if
it
were
between
a
state
and
a
territory
there
was
usually
a
commissioner
representing
that
state.
in
fact
the
only
boundaries
that
the
united
states
has
ever
surveyed
between
two
existing
states
are
both
involved
in
this
proceeding.
the
boundary
between
california
and
oregon,
they
were
both
states;
and
the
boundary
between
nevada
--
on
its
north
boundary
with
oregon.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
it
was
run
not
because
of
any
dispute
between
states.
the
united
states
surveyor
in
california
wrote
the
general
land
office
in
washington
and
said
the
majors
monument,
the
survey
between
california
and
oregon,
was
some
2
miles
and
30
chains
further
west
than
the
houghton-ives
monument,
the
joint
state
line.
and
they
said
such
a
discrepancy
should
not
go
unnoticed.
we
are
concerned,
let
us
go
up
there
and
do
something.
well,
it
is
our
contention
they
had
no
power
to
do
that,
that
the
line
had
been
fixed.
that
is
how
it
all
got
started.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
there
were
two
monuments,
both
purporting
to
be
the
47th
parallel
and
the
120th
meridian.
but
there
was
only
one
line
marked
on
the
ground,
the
houghton-ives
line
meridional
line
down
to
lake
taho.
majors
never
run
a
line
that
way.
he
went
straight
to
the
pacific
ocean.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
at
that
time
there
was
approximately
98
miles
left
unsurveyed,
because
nevada's
boundary
with
california
did
not
extend
to
the
colorado
river.
that
was
another
200
miles
further
down.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
and
lawson
in
the
1865
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
so
much
of
it
as
had
been
run.
this
is
frequently
done.
once
it
is
run
it
is
posted
and
it
serves
to
delineate
the
political
sovereignty
of
each
state.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
well,
we
submit
it
was
surveyed
within
about
20
miles
of
the
37th
parallel.
that
is
where
lawson
terminated
his
survey.
at
that
point
there
was
a
gap.
we
contend
though
that
the
united
states,
if
they
wanted
to
fill
that
gap
they
should
have
started
at
the
terminal
monument
on
the
state
survey
and
surveyed
on
to
the
colorado
river.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
filling
the
gap
from
the
already
posted
terminal
monument.
indeed,
all
that
is
necessary
for
federal
recognition
of
approval
of
a
boundary
is
the
closure
of
a
general
land
office
upon
that
line.
and
this
court
has
held
in
louisiana
v.
mississippi
that
the
closure
there
and
the
deeding
to
the
state
of
louisiana
lands
under
the
swamplands
grant
approved
louisiana's
title
up
to
that
boundary
line,
the
very
thing
the
general
land
office
has
done
here.
and
they
called
that
approval
and
recognition
by
the
federal
government.
at
the
time
of
admission
of
nevada
to
the
union
congress
is
presumed
to
know
the
boundaries
of
a
state.
that
is
west
virginia
v.
maryland.
and
at
the
time
of
nevada's
admission
to
the
union
there
was
a
defined
boundary
on
the
ground.
california
had
already
adopted
it
by
statute
ten
months
before
nevada
was
admitted
to
the
union.
and
nevada
submits
that
the
houghton-ives
boundary
was
constitutionally
established.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
you
cannot
move
the
territorial
limits
of
a
state.
washington
v.
oregon,
louisiana
v.
mississippi
and
new
mexico
v.
colorado,
which
is
the
most
analagous
case
to
this
one,
there
this
court
clearly
held
after
colorado
had
been
admitted
to
the
union
in
1876
its
right
to
rely
upon
the
line
previously
established
could
not
be
impaired
by
any
subsequent
on
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
and
congress
in
that
case
by
resolution
had
approved
the
carpenter
survey
and
president
roosevelt
--
theodore
roosevelt
vetoed
it
and
congress
never
overrode
that
veto,
he
put
the
line
back
where
it
was.
the
special
master
said
nevada's
territory
was
not
alienated
when
von
schmidt
picked
up
these
granite
markers
and
set
them
over
to
his
line.
i
suggest
the
mere
fact
of
all
those
patents
and,
the
nevada
patents
today,
the
plan
to
the
west,
the
von
schmidt
line
is
ample
proof
there
was
an
alienation
of
territory.
it
was
the
special
master's
conclusion
that
there
was
no
alienation
of
territory.
he
ignores
all
the
evidence
on
the
matter,
that
houghton-ives
was
the
first
practical
location
on
the
ground.
and
being
marked
for
the
first
time,
neither
california
nor
nevada
gained
or
lost
any
territory.
they
eliminated
their
political
sovereignty
for
the
first
time.
and
that
is
virginia
v.
tennessee.
therefore
there
was
no
need
for
a
compact
since
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
either
gained
or
lost
territory.
it
falls
that
any
movement
of
this
jointly
surveyed
state
boundary
would
alienate
the
territorial
estate.
and
it
did.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
the
120th
meridian
is
subject
to
being
moved.
it
may
be
moved
four
years
from
now
in
1983
when
the
geodetic
survey
tightens
up
the
geodetic
grid.
these
are
astronomic
lines
and
they
are
set
by
a
shooting
on
the
stars.
the
120th
that
is
marked
on
the
maps
that
you
have
in
front
of
you
is
a
geodetic
line.
but
everyone
who
goes
out
to
set
an
stronomic
line
is
going
to
put
it
in
a
different
place,
it
is
just
human
nature,
nature
of
the
surveying
technique
and
equipment.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
there
are;
yes,
sir,
you
are
right.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
that
is
true,
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
that
we
can
receive
signals
from
the
stars
and
fix
the
120th
meridian
within
three
feet
of
its
true
location.
but
i
submit
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
because
you
would
have
to
go
out
and
survey
every
western
state
boundary
all
over
again.
it
would
be
an
endless
--
really
upset
titles.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir.
i
might
add
that
the
43rd
meridian
did
not
spring
out
of
nevada's
constitution,
it
was
in
nevada's
enabling
act
by
congress.
at
the
time
nevada's
attorney
general
said,
we
welcome
this
new
"state
boundary,"
that
same
year
the
united
states
was
surveying
nevada's
northern
boundary.
so
we
had
to
get
up
there,
we
had
to
get
up
on
the
oblique.
so
when
they
said
fully
enclosed,
we
had
hoped
we
were
getting
an
enclosed
boundary
that
year,
which
we
did.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no,
sir,
we
have
argued
that
congress
has
recognized
that
they
were
different,
because
there
was
actually
a
survey.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
yes,
sir,
in
1850
congress
recognized
there
was
a
difference.
there
was
a
house
report
published
and
ordered
printed
by
congress
when
they
established
the
american
primary
meridian.
that
has
been
argued
--
mr.
james
h.
thompson
but
california
argues
that
the
congress
can
change
it
and
take
part
of
nevada
and
give
it
to
california.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
the
eastern
boundary
of
california
but
the
state
was
specified
at
the
43rd
meridian
west
of
washington.
mr.
james
h.
thompson
no.
thank
you.
