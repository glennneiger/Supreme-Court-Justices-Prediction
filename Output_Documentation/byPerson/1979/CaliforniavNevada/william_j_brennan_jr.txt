justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
we
accept
the
special
master's
report,
are
there
some
more
proceedings
before
the
special
master
that
have
to
go
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
not
concerned
with
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
question
is
where
a
certain
meridian
is,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
admitted
it
was
marked
out
on
the
ground
at
a
certain
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
the
united
states
has
acquiesced,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
just
argued
here
a
while
ago
that
the
united
states
has
recognized
the
von
schmidt
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
involved
before
us
right
now,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
just
happen
to
agree
with
you
on
this
acquiescence
issue,
we
don't
need
to
do
anything
else,
do
we?
