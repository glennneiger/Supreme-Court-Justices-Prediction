we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
79-5146,
rawlings
v.
kentucky.
mr.
aprile,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
how
they
got
into
the
young
lady's
purse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
was
it
important
how
they
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
this
is
a
fishing
expedition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
baffled
at
your
constant
repetition
of
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition
that
arises
out
of
a
motion
made
by
the
defendant,
not
by
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
it
persists
because
if
he
takes
the
stand
he
might
be
in
difficulty,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
he
testifying?
at
pretrial
or
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
can't
be
used
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
is
the
chief
motivation
of
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
the
courts
have
said
is
the
court's
reason
for
doing
it,
which
are
wholly
independent
and
separate
from
the
defendant's
purposes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
stopping
right
on
that
question,
if
they
asked
him
a
question
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
suppression
hearing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
the
judge
forced
him
to
answer,
haven't
you
got
a
compelled
incrimination
claim
as
to
that
particular
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
wouldn't
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn't
make
for
automatic
standing,
as
justice
white
said
to
you
before.
so
which
which
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
told
us
the
entire
conversation.
i
finally
found
what
i
was
trying
to
recall.
she
said,
"david,
i
do
not
want
to
carry
this
in
my
purse."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
question
that
your
friend
hypothesized,
that
is,
did
you
have
these
drugs
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them,
and
an
immediate
objection,
the
objection
is
overruled
by
the
hearing
judge
and
he
is
ordered
to
answer,
now
would
that
be
held
as
self-incrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
question
that
i
postulated
to
you
relevant
to
the
suppression
hearing,
that
is,
did
you
have
these
drugs
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them,
did
you
intend
to
sell
them,
had
you
sold
some
of
them,
is
that
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
shouldn't
be
allowed,
should
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
is
compelled
under
an
order
of
the
court
to
answer,
he
is
being
compelled
to
incriminate
himself,
isn't
he,
unless
that
evidence
is
excluded
at
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
unless,
unless
you
exclude
it
at
trial,
that
is
the
only
protection
he
has
got
against
self-incrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
concede
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
moral
of
that
story
is
that
you
should
keep
out
of
the
narcotics
business.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
is
the
consequence
of
this
young
lady's
answer
to
him,
"david,
i
do
not
want
to
carry
this"
--
referring
to
the
drugs
--
"i
do
not
want
to
carry
this
in
my
purse."
does
that
have
any
effect
on
his
claim
that
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
as
an
alternative
she
had
been
charged
with
possession
of
the
drugs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
she
would
be
able
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
right
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
