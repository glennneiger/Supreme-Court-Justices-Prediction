justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
it
turned
out
that
the
search
of
the
purse
was
perfectly
legal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
his
question
meant
whether
getting
into
the
purse
was
legal
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
makes
a
difference
whether
it
was
legal,
getting
into
the
purse
was
legal
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
you
might
have
standing,
the
only
thing
is
you
would
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
your
first
point,
which
as
i
understand
it
is
that
your
example
is
that
if
something
is
found
in
a
suitcase
and
he
is
charged
with
possession
of
that
item,
he
can't
later
on
get
on
the
stand
and
testify
sort
of
tangentially
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
that
argument
apply
equally
if
he
were
charged
with
murder
and
there
were
a
gun
in
the
suitcase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
really
not
particularly
related
to
the
automatic
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
part
of
your
argument
really
is
that
the
cross-examination
by
the
prosecutor
going
into
the
motives
was
really
improper
examination
and
i
wonder
if
your
argument
has
the
same
force
if
one
presumes
the
trial
judge
wouldn't
allow
that
kind
of
cross-examination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
did
anybody
ever
have
to
get
to
automatic
standing
then
in
this
case
if
you
are
claiming
that
you
have
a
privacy
interest
in
the
purse,
that
the
seizure
of
your
property
was
the
product
of
an
illegal
search
of
what
is
in
effect
your
property,
why
the
big
hassle
about
automatic
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
was
this
claim
ever
made
to
anybody,
this
particular
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
has
been
rejected
at
every
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
what
basis,
that
you
didn't
have
an
interest
in
the
purse
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
you
have
to
say
that
you
had
a
privacy
interest
in
the
purse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
the
courts
reject
a
claim
that
he
had
a
privacy
interest
in
the
purse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
to
have
that
claim
and
doesn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
so.
i
don't
think
you've
got
any
--
if
she
had
consented,
by
the
way,
to
search
of
the
purse,
you
know
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that
your
interest
in
the
property
wouldn't
have
done
you
any
good.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
i
agree
with
you,
or
if
there
had
been
a
warrant
to
search
the
purse,
it
wouldn't
have
done
you
any
good
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
a
legitimate
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you've
got
a
claim
of
some
privacy
interest
in
the
purse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
never
did
then.
i
take
it
that
you
are
telling
me
you
never
did
claim
a
privacy
interest
in
the
purse
anywhere
in
these
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
ever
present
to
the
lower
courts
your
third
argument
that
you
present
in
your
brief,
that
the
search
of
the
purse
was
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
no,
was
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
of
the
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
is
a
warrant
that
--
the
search
of
the
purse
took
place
after
the
warrant
issued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
had
a
warrant
to
search
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
the
warrant
to
search
the
house
didn't
authorize
anybody
to
search
a
person
in
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
any
guest
in
the
house
could
object
to
overstepping
the
search
warrant
and
the
search
warrant
was
overstepped
by
searching
the
person,
timely
a
purse
and
hence
your
property
was
seized
and
is
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
presented
anywhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fox,
on
the
question
of
whether
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse,
how
do
we
answer
that?
do
we
answer
that
based
on
the
relationship
between
the
parties
or
on
our
judgment
as
to
whether
he
actually
expected
that
nobody
would
look
inside
the
purse?
what
is
the
test?
