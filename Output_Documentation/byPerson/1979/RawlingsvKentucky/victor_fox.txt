mr.
victor
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
automatic
standing
in
possession
cases
is
no
longer
necessary
for
the
protection
of
substantive
fourth
amendment
rights.
as
we
have
heard
this
afternoon,
the
basis
for
automatic
standing
which
came
out
in
jones
was
simply
the
problem
of
self-incrimination,
i.e.,
the
clash
between
one
asserting
his
fourth
amendment
rights
at
perhaps
the
expense
of
the
fifth
amendment;
and
the
second
aspect,
which
we
contend
basically
was
thrown
in
as
an
afterthought,
and
that
is
the
so-called
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction.
we
submit
simply
that
simmons
has
solved
the
problem
at
least
of
that
portion
of
jones
which
says
self-incrimination.
an
individual
may
go
in
at
a
motion
to
suppress
and
assert
his
fourth
amendment
substantive
rights
without
fear
of
this
being
used
against
him
as
evidence
of
his
guilt
at
trial.
the
fact
that
it
may
come
back
a
little
later
as
perhaps
impeachment
purposes,
we
would
submit
is
not
sufficient
to
expand
the
exclusionary
rule
to
exclude
this.
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
of
course,
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
in
a
fifth
amendment
context,
in
the
harris
case,
this
court
has
said
we
are
unwilling
to
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
point
where
it
would
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
commit
perjury.
we
are
submitting
that
this
is
just
as
applicable
to
the
fourth
amendment
right
as
it
is
within
the
fifth
amendment.
this
we
submit
is
sufficient
as
to
the
impeachment
purposes.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
pointed
out
a
case
in
kentucky
called
jett,
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
rule
in
jett
for
the
purpose
of
substantive
use.
and
it
says,
"out
of
court
statements
made
by
any
person
who
appears
as
a
witness,
which
statement
is
relevant
and
material
to
issues,
may
be
received
as
substantive
evidence
through
another
witness
and
need
not
be
limited
to
impeachment
purposes.
we
submit
that
this
is
simply
the
very
situation
which
simmons
attempted
or
does
in
fact,
we
submit,
cure.
first
of
all,
we
would
say
that
testimony
at
a
suppression
hearing
is
not
necessarily
an
out
of
court
statement.
it
is
part
of
the
same
proceedings.
second,
it
would
require
that
the
person
making
the
statement,
i.e.,
the
accused,
first
testify
as
a
witness
before
jett
would
come
into
play.
finally,
the
key
here,
that
which
is
substantive,
material,
relevant
to
the
issues,
i.e.,
substantive
use
of
evidence
of
guilt,
is
that
which
is
prohibited
in
simmons.
that
leaves
only
the
impeachment
aspect
of
it,
a
contradictory
statement
which
we
submit
again,
as
previously
pointed
out,
is
permissible.
finally,
the
basis
for
the
--
the
only
basis
i
should
say
left
for
jones
for
the
automatic
concept,
rather
than
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
rights,
is
the
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction.
this
is
the
only
aspect,
as
the
dissent
in
a
footnote
in
rakas
points
out,
this
is
the
only
thing
that
is
really
left
of
jones.
we
have
here
people
who
are
accused
of
a
possessory
crime
being
treated
substantially
different
than
any
other
accused.
for
example,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
the
same
factual
situation
as
in
this
case,
we
add
one
additional
element,
a
third
person
has
a
revolver
in
mrs.
cox's
purse.
as
a
result
of
that
revolver
being
found
in
her
purse,
he
is
charged
with
murder.
now,
the
respondent
--
petitioner
would
have
us
believe
that
mr.
rawlings
is
entitled
to
automatic
standing,
i.e.,
assertion
of
mrs.
cox's
fourth
amendment
rights,
because
of
his
possessionary
crime
where
the
individual
who
is
charged
with
murder
cannot
assert
vicarious
fourth
amendment
right
or
vicariously
assert
it.
we
are
creating
or
have
created
by
this
one
remaining
aspect
of
jones
a
special
class
of
defendant
out
here.
the
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
by
merely
going
in
upon
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress
and
the
government
saying
what
reasonable
right
of
privacy,
expectation
of
privacy
did
you
have
in
that
which
was
seized
or
that
which
was
searched,
and
having
that
individual
give
factors
to
show
some
reason
why
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
then
to
come
back
at
trial
and
under
the
concept
of
possession
under
a
penal
code
assert
that
there
was
possession
sufficient
for
conviction.
there
is
nothing
contradictory
about
that.
assuming
that
there
is
no
longer
the
need
--
mr.
victor
fox
there
would
be
a
problem
for
the
self-incrimination
aspect,
yes,
your
honor,
as
with
any
other
defendant.
mr.
victor
fox
what
do
i
think
about
jones?
i
think
simmons
articulated
somewhat
more
clear
what
jones
attempted
to
do
and
that
is
resolve
the
problem
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
mr.
victor
fox
are
you
referring
to
the
fishing
expedition
aspect
of
it?
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are
all
excludable.
the
point
is
that,
first
of
all,
simmons
excludes
those
items
--
mr.
victor
fox
if
these
other
statements,
other
items
go
to
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
go
to
guilt,
as
simmons
refers,
i
believe
they
would
be
prohibited
by
simmons.
but
if
it
goes
beyond
that,
if
it
is
immaterial,
then
the
exclusion
which
comes
from
evidence
which
is
not
material
to
or
irrelevant
to
the
issues
is
not
admissible.
mr.
victor
fox
well,
your
honor,
under
kentucky
law
the
charge
of
trafficking
does
include
not
only
possession
but
the
sale,
and
so
forth,
and
it
would
be
no
more
so
than
that
is
the
purpose
of
simmons,
to
prevent
the
assertion
of
the
fourth
amendment
right
at
the
expense
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
self-incrimination.
at
a
suppression
hearing,
it
is
not
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
whether
this
can
be
used
at
a
later
point
in
time
on
that
issue
--
mr.
victor
fox
it
is
really
not
relevant
or
material.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
he
has
not
been
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
because
that
evidence
is
not
admissible
at
trial
because
it
goes
to
--
mr.
victor
fox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
i
will
concede
that
without
the
simmons
protection
anything
he
says
at
the
suppression
hearing
can
be
used
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
guilt.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
basically
it.
he
had
to
flip
a
coin
and
if
it
came
down
fourth
amendment
he
went
after
his
fourth
amendment
rights,
if
it
came
down
fifth
amendment
he
didn't.
that
may
be
a
rather
cut
and
dried
view
of
it,
but
that
was
basically
what
he
was
faced
with
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
victor
fox
i
am
unaware,
sir,
of
that.
mr.
victor
fox
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
--
mr.
victor
fox
i
would
say
that
if
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
and
goes
to
his
guilt,
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be.
i
would
say
that
any
time
you
lose
a
motion
to
suppress,
whether
it
be
in
a
narcotics
case
or
any
other
case
--
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
victor
fox
my
personal
experience
is
i
am
unaware
of
any,
your
honor,
because
we
only
get
those
where
he
is
convicted
on
appeal.
mr.
victor
fox
very
well,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
simply
simmons
has
resolved
these
issues
and
that
under
the
prosecutorial
concept
of
self-contradiction
no
longer
being
a
valid
basis
for
retention
of
the
automatic
standing
we
then
look
at
the
issues
as
they
come
to
expectation
of
privacy,
and
in
rakas
this
court
has,
of
course,
rejected
the
standing
concept
for
the
reasonable
expectation.
factors
which
you
must
take
into
consideration
or
that
are
taken
into
consideration
in
reaching
whether
an
individual
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
first
of
all
the
nature
of
the
premises.
mr.
victor
fox
he
would
have
to
demonstrate
some
reasonable
expectation
--
mr.
victor
fox
i
would
hope
that
he
would
be
capable
from
his
viewpoint.
mr.
victor
fox
he
goes
through,
you
know,
why
he
was
there,
what
his
interest
was
--
mr.
victor
fox
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed
i
won't
make
a
judgment
on.
whether
he
has
the
right
to
assert
his
fourth
--
if
he
proves
that
it
was
his
fourth
amendment,
then
under
the
facts
that
they
were
in
there
with
a
search
warrant
for
a
piano
and
they
go
through
a
jewel
box
--
mr.
victor
fox
--
there
is
no
question.
mr.
victor
fox
as
a
result
of
it
not
being
a
search
of
--
mr.
victor
fox
it
is
a
warrantless
search
under
--
mr.
victor
fox
he
has
an
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
victor
fox
they
first
arrived
on
the
scene
to
serve
an
arrest
warrant.
then
because
--
mr.
victor
fox
they
didn't
search
here
then.
they
returned
with
what
they
thought
was
a
valid
search
warrant.
mr.
victor
fox
then
they
searched
her
and
they
thought
at
that
time
they
had
a
valid
search
warrant
to
search
her.
mr.
victor
fox
it
turned
out
that
the
warrant
was
not,
but
it
still
did
not
change
the
--
mr.
victor
fox
that's
right,
but
they
thought
they
were
obtaining
a
warrant
for
the
people
and
that
is
evident
from
the
evidence,
the
testimony
of
the
officers.
at
any
rate,
we
are
admitting
that
the
search
of
her
purse
was
without
a
valid
warrant.
now
the
question
is
what
is
his
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse.
mr.
victor
fox
as
a
casual
visitor?
mr.
victor
fox
he
walked
in,
he
was
a
transient,
he
had
never
been
there
before,
there
was
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
victor
fox
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
i
thought
that
the
individual
had
his
drugs
in
a
dresser
of
his
within
that
house.
mr.
victor
fox
which
was
just
another
transient.
for
him
to
come
in
and
demonstrate
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
premise,
the
mere
fact
he
was
there
is
insufficient.
that
is
only
one
factor.
mr.
victor
fox
your
example
is
relevant
only
in
the
fact
that
his
mere
presence
is
and
of
itself
the
sole
determining
factor.
his
presence
is
merely
a
factor
among
others
to
be
considered
before
you
reach
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
he
had
a
fourth
amendment
expectation
of
privacy.
his
presence
there
is
but
one
factor.
mr.
victor
fox
it
would
indicate
that
first
of
all
it
would
have
no
effect
upon
his
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse,
applying
the
factors,
and
assuming
that
he
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse
under
the
fourth
amendment
substantive
right
process,
does
the
fact
that
he
placed
his
drugs
in
her
purse
create
an
expectation
of
privacy.
his
placing
of
those
drugs
in
her
purse
without
her
active
consent
--
and
at
this
point
we
do
disagree
with
the
petitioner
on
that
point
--
it
would
be
no
more
different
than
his
breaking
into
a
home
and
hiding
the
drugs
--
and
i
believe
i
heard
an
example
this
morning
of
an
individual
going
into
a
home
in
the
earlier
salvucci
case
and
placing
the
drugs
in
the
basement
and
the
police
illegally
searching
the
basement.
his
expectation
of
privacy
is
diminished
by
the
placing
of
the
drugs
in
her
purse
without
her
consent.
mr.
aprile
pointed
out
that
the
spouse
--
and
here
again,
going
back
with
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
concept
to
those
areas,
each
case
must
be
considered
upon
its
facts,
and
this
is
why
we
are
saying
it
is
no
longer
necessary
and
no
longer
in
fact
should
the
automatic
standing
remain.
i
would
have
far
more
expectation
of
privacy
in
my
wife's
purse
than
i
would
in
my
brother's
briefcase.
it
is
a
recognition
granted
by
society
that
as
a
part
of
a
unit,
a
marital
unit
i
would
have
some
degree.
at
the
same
time,
i
would
not
have
the
same
amount
of
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse
than
she
has.
here
the
individual
was
not
a
spouse,
was
a
casual
acquaintance
of
approximately
a
week's
time.
he
had
never
put
anything
in
this
purse
before.
his
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is
rather
diminished
and
really
not
one
which
society
would
be
prepared
to
recognize,
which
brings
us
to
the
final
point,
his
expectation
of
privacy
in
contraband.
this
court
in
brown
has
said
that
there
was
no
protected
interest
in
stolen
property.
stolen
property
is
just
nothing
but
another
form
of
contraband.
we
would
simply
submit
that
society
is
not
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
contraband.
mr.
victor
fox
the
search
warrant
covered
the
premises.
mr.
victor
fox
i
do
not
recall.
the
search
warrant
is
not
a
part
of
the
record.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
victor
fox
they
went
in
and
in
searching
for
the
individual
named
in
the
arrest
warrant
--
mr.
victor
fox
it
was
never
a
part
of
the
record
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
i
happen
to
have
a
xerox
copy
in
my
office,
but
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
victor
fox
i
believe
we
would
have
problems
under
ybarra.
mr.
victor
fox
if
the
purse
was
sitting
over
by
itself
--
mr.
victor
fox
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
in
that
case.
mr.
victor
fox
our
trial
court
in
its
opinion
also
--
and
i
will
make
this
point
--
we
have
basically
since
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
intermediate
said
that
the
search
of
her
purse
was
a
warrantless
search
and
must
be
justified
under
some
other
exclusion
or
some
exception
to
it.
the
courts
have
agreed
--
mr.
victor
fox
basically,
your
honor,
we
have.
that
order
also
in
there
states
that
there
was
a
finding
that
he
had
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse.
that
point
is
in
there,
in
response
to
an
earlier
question
of
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
we
have
to
--
assuming
that
the
automatic
standing
no
longer
exists,
we
then
must
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
surrounding
this
case
within
that
concept.
first
of
all,
did
he
have
a
reasonable
expectation
--
mr.
victor
fox
that
is
correct,
that
is
that
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse,
which
we
deny,
and
that
his
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
drugs
was
insufficient
to
constitute
a
protected
interest.
mr.
victor
fox
well,
there
are
some
factors
that
we
must
look
at,
and
i
would
--
basically
these
are
the
nature
of
the
premises
or
the
activity
involved,
the
personal
interest
in
that
point,
the
steps
taken
by
the
individual
to
protect
that
privacy,
and
whether
society
really
characterizes
that
as
something
which
is
to
be
protected.
these
are
all
factors.
a
possessory
interest
is
really
a
factor
as
well.
it
is
not
the
sole
purpose,
but
we
apply
all
of
these
factors
and
we
look
at
the
situation
involving
the
purse,
and
that
is
first
of
all
he
has
no
possessory
interest
in
the
purse,
he
didn't
buy
the
purse,
he
didn't
give
it
to
her,
it
wasn't
his
that
she
was
carrying
for
him.
what
steps
did
he
take
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
purse?
he
didn't
attempt
to
hide
it,
he
didn't
say
don't
let
anybody
see
this.
society's
characterization,
which
i
gave
earlier,
of
my
spouse's
purse
as
opposed
to
my
expectation
of
privacy
in
someone
else's
spouse's
purse
or
someone
else's
purse,
this
characterization,
society
i
don't
think
would
characterize
that
he
really
had
some
interest
in
her
purse,
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
purse.
mr.
victor
fox
her
expectation
of
privacy
--
mr.
victor
fox
basically
i
will
answer
your
second
question.
i
don't
see
too
much
difference.
now,
the
purpose
is
what
is
his
expectation
of
privacy
in
her
dress.
she
has
a
tremendous
expectation
of
privacy
in
both
her
purse
and
that
which
society
is
willing
to
recognize.
it
only
goes
to
what
society
and
what
his
expectation
is
in
that,
and
i
believe
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
which
the
search
of
the
purse
and
so
forth
is
sufficient.
now,
if
he
had
under
the
same
factual
situation
had
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
stuff
in
her
pockets
or
putting
stuff
in
her
pockets
or
with
her
consent
and
she
had
not
said
i
don't
want
it
in
there,
then
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
is
her
purse
or
her
pockets.
mr.
victor
fox
we
wouldn't
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
by
all
means.
by
all
means,
and
i
don't
believe
we
would
be
here
if
she
had
asserted
her
fourth
amendment
right
to
privacy.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
