that
wouldn't
be
an
inconsistency.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
bound
to
be
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
do
you
think
is
left
of
mcgautha
after
our
subsequent
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
all
your
reasoning
is
that
the
defendant
should
be
encouraged
to
do
everything
he
can
to
prevent
the
prosecution
from
establishing
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
charges
it
brings
against
him
if
there
is
some
constitutional
implication
in
the
thing,
and
that
no
weight
should
be
attached
whatever
to
the
usefulness
of
the
trial
as
a
process
for
finding
out
whether
or
not
the
charges
are
true.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
trial
judge
always
has
the
right
and
duty,
doesn't
he,
to
exclude
evidence
that
isn't
probative
or
isn't
relevant
to
the
issues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
talking
about
a
trial,
which
is
where
a
--
assuming
the
suppression
motion
doesn't
end
up
with
a
finding
of
guilt
or
the
imposition
of
a
sentence.
i
am
saying
at
a
trial
the
judge
has
a
right
and
duty
to
exclude
non-probative,
non-relevant
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
might
lead
to
the
truth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
he
is
not
guilty
he
has
got
nothing
to
hide,
presumably.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
made
the
suppression
motion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government
certainly
doesn't
make
suppression
motions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
finder
of
fact
has
a
right
to
disbelieve
the
testimony
of
anyone.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
they
said
that
she
did
give
him
permission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
have
they
said
specifically
that
she
did
give
him
permission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
permission.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
aprile,
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
you
referred
to
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
chadwick.
how
finely
can
you
slice
that
--
i
use
the
word
"onion"
not
with
any
disrespect,
although
i
did
dissent,
but
that
concept.
suppose
it
is
not
a
footlocker,
it
is
not
a
suitcase,
but
it
is
a
small
paper
bag,
does
the
same
ruling
still
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
heartening
to
know.
(laughter)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually,
prior
to
jones
all
of
the
trend
in
the
lower
courts
has
been
exactly
the
opposite
to
jones,
had
it
not,
that
the
defendant
had
simply
to
fish
or
cut
bait
on
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
learned
hand
had
written
one
of
those
opinions.
