mr.
attorney
general,
isn't
it
true,
lawyer
to
lawyer,
that
when
you
lose
your
suppression
hearing
on
a
drug
case,
you
go
to
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
all
practical
standpoint,
in
a
dope
case,
a
narcotics
case,
when
you
lose
your
motion
for
suppression
of
the
evidence,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
road
for
the
defense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
that
narcotics
is
in
a
category
all
by
itself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
cases
are
you
aware
of
where
dope
is
admitted
in
evidence
where
the
man
was
acquitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
handed
this
to
her
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
or
her
dress,
would
he
expect
any
privacy
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
going
to
be
fair
with
you.
my
next
question
is
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
pocket
book.
