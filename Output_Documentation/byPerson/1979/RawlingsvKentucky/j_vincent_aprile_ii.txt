mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
today
presents
four
issues.
the
primary
issue
is
the
first
issue,
and
it
deals
with
whether
the
petitioner,
david
rawlings,
has
standing,
that
is,
is
he
entitled
to
raise
a
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
generated
by
the
illegal
search
of
the
purse
of
vanessa
cox
and
the
seizure
from
that
purse
of
property,
including
contraband
drugs,
on
the
basis
that
the
property,
one,
belonged
to
mr.
rawlings,
and,
two,
on
the
basis
that
he
was
charged
with
an
offense
that
was
the
possession
of
those
very
contraband
drugs.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
the
searches
and
seizures,
all
of
them,
not
only
of
vanessa
cox's
purse
but
also
of
mr.
rawlings,
and
the
other
incriminating
evidence
were
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
detention
and
arrest
of
both
petitioner
and
vanessa
cox
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
third
issue
and
the
fourth
issue
in
the
case
are
derivative
issues
that
depend
upon
this
court
finding
the
first
issue
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
third
issue,
that
the
search
of
vanessa
cox's
purse
was
unconstitutional,
has
been
conceded
in
this
court
by
the
respondent.
so
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we
are
entitled
to
assert
the
illegalities
in
that
situation.
i
would
immediately
turn
to
that
first
issue
and
tell
you
that
we
are
proceeding
on
three
different
theories.
we
are
proceeding
first
on
the
theory
of
automatic
standing,
because
under
any
restrictive
construction
that
you
give
to
the
doctrine
of
automatic
standing,
david
rawlings
clearly
qualifies.
the
theory
of
the
prosecution's
case,
the
indictment,
everything
points
to
the
fact
that
david
rawlings
is
charged
with
possession
of
these
contraband
drugs
while
they
are
in
the
purse
of
vanessa
cox,
and
when
they
were
searched,
october
18,
1976
is
the
date
of
the
crime
and
the
date
of
the
purse.
so
there
is
no
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
entitled
to
automatic
standing.
the
question
is
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
under
the
first
analysis
that
we
propose
for
automatic
standing,
we
would
suggest
no,
it
does
not
matter
how
they
got
there,
except
in
a
situation
--
no,
i
would
say
under
automatic
standing
it
would
not
matter.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i'm
sorry,
the
question
that
was
addressed
to
me,
your
honor,
was
how
they
got
into
the
purse,
not
how
it
was
taken
out.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
with
regard
to
automatic
standing?
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
suggest
with
regard
to
automatic
standing
that
would
not
deal
with
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
on
the
question
of
the
merits
of
it,
yes.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
that
would
be
determinative
of
the
merits
of
the
issue.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
addressing
the
question
of
automatic
standing
in
this
situation,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
three
major
concepts
that
are
involved
here,
and
i
think
--
excuse
me,
there
would
be
two,
and
the
first
one
would
be
subdivided
into
three
concepts.
the
first
question
is
the
dilemma
of
self-incrimination,
and
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
we
take
the
position
that
simmons
has
not
eradicated
completely
for
the
defendant
the
dilemma
of
self-incrimination
that
occurs
when
he
must
take
the
stand
in
a
suppression
hearing
and
testify
to
either
ownership
or
possession
of
the
premises
searched
where
the
possessory
offense
crime
was
committed,
that
is
where
the
possession
of
the
contraband
material
occurred,
or
where
he
must
take
the
stand
and
admit
either
ownership
or
possession
of
the
contraband
goods
themselves
which
are
the
very
gravamen
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
we
say
that
this
exists
for
three
reasons.
the
first
one
is
the
danger
of
impeachment.
and
as
this
court
will
know,
it
does
not
require
a
situation
where
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
in
a
suppression
hearing
and
says
one
thing
and
then
takes
the
stand
at
trial
and
says
another
thing
that
is
an
outright
lie.
all
in
most
jurisdictions
required
for
impeachment
is
an
inconsistent
statement.
so
if
this
defendant
wants
to
assert,
for
example,
possessory
ownership,
possessory
interest
or
ownership
interest
in
the
contraband,
he
may
come
in
and
say,
in
this
particular
situation
i
owned
the
suitcase
in
which
this
was
found,
and
in
that
situation
when
he
asserts
that
in
a
possessory
offense,
he
may
then
want
to
take
the
stand
and
say
but
i
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
the
drugs
got
in
there.
once
he
would
say
i
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
the
drugs
got
in
there,
then
the
prosecutor
could
say
us
we
want
to
introduce
the
inconsistency
that
that
was
his
suitcase,
and
in
that
situation
a
marginal
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
say
to
you
that
i
have
seen
numerous
cases
on
appeal
in
which
that
type
of
ruling
has
been
made
by
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
on
appeal
that
that
is
enough
of
an
inconsistency
to
allow
the
question
of
credibility
to
be
raised.
the
real
issue
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
the
real
issue,
your
honor,
is
will
it
deter
a
defendant
and
his
defense
attorney
from
going
ahead
and
challenging
the
propriety
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
that
was
the
rationale
behind
jones.
you
reaffirmed
that
in
mcgautha
v.
california
when
you
said
the
reason
why
we
say
this
is
a
dilemma
of
self-incrimination
here
is
because
the
danger
is
it
will
deter
people
from
bringing
marginal
fourth
amendment
claims.
that
is
an
incredibly
good
reason
for
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
don't
think
that
mcgautha
--
i
don't
think
the
question
in
mcgautha
was
reached,
perhaps
in
dicta,
but
it
was
a
discussion
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
in
the
previous
case
to
show
what
you
meant
by
simmons,
and
that
is
all
i
am
using
it
for.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
the
underpinnings
of
mcgautha
with
regard
to
death
penalty
is
still
good
law.
i
am
just
talking
about
your
discussion
of
the
tension
and
the
reasons
in
simmons
behind
the
prophylactic
rule
that
you
enunciated.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think
there
are
two
important
considerations,
when
i
respond
to
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
first
one
very
basically
is
i
cannot
accept
chief
justice
burger's
position
that
every
motion
to
suppress
is
a
motion
to
exclude
the
truth.
that
simply
has
not
been
the
result
of
practical
experience.
sometimes
it
excludes
the
truth,
sometimes
it
excludes
falsity
done
by
the
police,
such
as
motion
to
exclude
or
suppress
on
the
basis
of
an
involuntary
confession.
you
have
even
said
in
cases
such
as
mincey
v.
arizona
that
the
very
question
of
the
validity
of
the
truthfulness
of
that
confession
is
at
issue
and
you
would
not
allow
impeachment
under
similar
circumstances
to
harris
v.
new
york.
so
we
can't
just
start
off
with
a
presumption
that
every
motion
to
suppress
is
an
attempt
to
destroy
the
truth-finding
process.
in
some
instances
it
may
very
well
be,
but
i
think
the
second
and
most
important
response
that
we
have
here
goes
to
the
concept
of
what
was
talked
about
earlier,
and
that
is
this
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction.
and
i
would
just
simply
jump
ahead
to
that
to
say
that
what
is
the
government
attempting
to
say.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
your
analysis
and
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
deem
it
in
any
way.
i
agree
with
it.
my
response,
however,
is
that
jones
was
not
predicated
on
the
fact
that
these
problems
would
not
occur
in
other
kinds
of
situations.
it
was
predicated
on
the
knowledge
that
where
the
crime
is
a
possessory
off
use,
the
danger
is
the
greatest.
and
we
all
know
as
a
practical
reality
that
i'm
not
up
here
just
saying
something
for
the
purposes
of
appellate
argument.
in
each
of
the
examples
that
i
would
give,
that
is,
impeachment,
substantive
use
of
prior
inconsistent
statements,
in
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition,
the
danger
is
always
the
greatest
when
the
defendant
is
testifying
at
the
suppression
hearing
about
something
that
directly
relates
to
his
involvement
with
the
possession
itself,
the
very
nature
of
the
charge.
the
example
you
give
is
very
true.
what
about
a
murder
situation
when
the
defendant
comes
in
and
he
testifies,
yes,
the
shirt
that
you
found
is
mine.
okay.
and
consequently
this
evidentiary
item
gives
me
standing
to
contest
the
search,
say
of
the
third
person,
the
premises
where
the
shirt
was
left.
what
else
will
be
generated
by
the
fact
that
he
has
acknowledged
that
this
incredulous
piece
of
evidentiary
material
is
his?
it
is
not
going
to
open
up
all
kinds
of
opportunities
for
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition,
and
it
is
probably
not
going
to
generate
much
in
the
way
of
impeachment
or
the
substantive
use
of
prior
inconsistent
statements
in
a
jurisdiction
like
kentucky.
so
i
suggest
the
danger
is
the
greatest
in
possessory
offenses,
and
that
is
what
was
recognized
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
majority
opinion
in
jones
v.
united
states,
and
that
is
very
significant.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think
that
is
an
interesting
question
you
ask
me,
your
honor,
because
i
would
point
to
two
things.
it
is
interesting
with
regard
to
the
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition.
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
this
case
took
the
position
that
that
certainly
is
just
a
legitimate
function
of
the
adversarial
nature
of
the
prosecution's
function.
they
said
that
it
is
good
for
a
prosecutor
in
a
suppression
hearing
to
take
the
tactic
of
trying
to
find
out
everything
you
can
when
the
defendant
testifies.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
non-probative
and
non-relevant,
but
the
point
is
an
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition
example
that
we
just
mentioned,
what
would
happen
is
that
the
suppression
hearing
would
generate
all
kinds
of
leads,
all
kinds
of
information.
the
case
at
bar
is
a
perfect
example.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
the
point
is
the
defendant
was
only
taking
the
stand
for
the
purposes
of
establishing
standing.
he
takes
the
stand
for
that
purpose.
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
allows
him,
as
occurred
in
the
case
at
bar,
to
go
way
far
afield
asking
whom
did
you
try
to
sell
these
drugs
to,
in
a
case
of
trying
to
prove
trafficking.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
placing
an
incredible
burden
on
his
right
to
assert
standing.
he
comes
in
to
assert
standing
and
he
is
required
to
truly
incriminate
himself.
that
is
exactly
what
you
are
saying.
that
is
exactly
what
simmons
was
supposed
to
stop.
duncan
v.
state,
the
maryland
supreme
court
said
about
the
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition,
this
is
exactly
the
vice
that
jones
was
intended
to
prevent.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
peruse
the
suppression
hearing
number
two
in
the
case
at
bar,
there
was
nothing
more
than
a
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
did
not
make
the
suppression
motion.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
the
point
is,
even
under
simmons
he
was
allowed
to
go
into
that
suppression
hearing
to
be
protected
when
he
made
his
statements
to
allege
standing,
that
they
would
not
be
in
turn
used
against
him.
here
in
a
prosecutorial
fishing
expedition
situation,
it
becomes
derivative
evidence
which
the
defendant
would
be
hard-pressed
to
ever
prove
came
directly
from
the
testimony
that
he
gave
during
the
course
of
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
arise
out
of
the
motion
to
suppress,
it
arises
out
of
not
allowing
automatic
standing
and
forcing
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand,
not
to
establish
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
but
to
establish
whether
or
not
he
has
the
right
to
even
raise
the
merits,
and
that
is
what
the
automatic
standing
rule
was
generated
to
prevent,
and
that
is
what
simmons
does
not
answer
and
that
is
why
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
dilemma
of
self-incrimination
continues
to
persist
despite
simmons
for
the
defendant
and
the
defense
attorney
who
is
counseling
him,
and
those
are
the
three
reasons.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
as
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
in
this
case
wanted
to
establish
not
only
possession
but
possession
for
the
purposes
of
sale,
trafficking.
they've
got
this
man
on
the
stand
who
is
now
testifying
that
those
were
his
drugs,
so
he
can
show
an
actual
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
he
is
testifying
at
a
suppression
hearing
pretrial,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
that
is
the
point.
maybe
that
can't
be
introduced
against
him,
but
all
of
a
sudden,
now
that
he
is
on
the
stand,
the
prosecutor
has
a
wide
open
vista
to
ask
him
did
you
ever
try
to
sell
these
drugs
to
anybody.
that
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
standing.
what
that
is
relevant
to
is
establishing
why
did
you
possess
the
drugs.
he
possessed
them
for
purposes
of
sale.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
time
the
motion
to
suppress
concept
is
to
stop
the
government
from
violating
constitutional
rights.
and
as
mcgautha
indicated,
as
simmons
indicated,
we
are
going
to
give
this
kind
of
protection
because
we
don't
want
defendants
to
be
deterred
from
raising
marginal
fourth
amendment
claims
because
we
don't
want
the
police
to
engage
in
unconstitutional
activities,
and
that
is
what
a
motion
to
suppress
is
all
about.
it
is
not
just
vindicating
rights
of
the
defendant,
it
is
vindicating
the
rights
of
society
against
incorrect
police
procedures
that
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
don't
know,
sir,
i
don't
propose
to
say
that.
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
my
chief
motivation
as
a
defense
attorney,
but
i
realize
that
it
is
a
legitimate
motivation
and
it
is
one
of
my
motivations
as
a
defense
attorney.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
acknowledge
that,
your
honor.
in
some
situations,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
you
feel
that
it
is
unfortunate
and
unfair
that
a
guilty
person
goes
free
because
the
constable
blundered.
i
understand
that.
but
the
point
is
what
we
are
talking
about
is
what
was
the
motivating
policy
reason
behind
automatic
standing,
and
this
is
exactly
what
it
was,
to
allow
people
to
raise
marginal
fourth
amendment
claims
without
being
afraid
that
the
testimony
they
provide
in
the
suppression
hearing
to
establish
standing
would
come
back
to
haunt
them
as
a
form
of
self-incrimination,
and
that
is
my
response.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to
a
moment
ago,
your
honor,
and
i
guess
i
lost
track
of
it.
i
apologize.
but
this
respondent
argues
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible.
the
solicitor
general
in
the
previous
case
argues
that
no
self-respecting
trial
judge,
no
self-respecting
prosecutor
would
ever
do
these
things
and
that
they
would
stop
it
if
it
occurred,
and
i
just
submit
to
you
that
there
certainly
is
not
unanimity
on
the
side
of
the
prosecutors
in
their
approach
to
this,
nor
in
the
trial
judge.
in
this
case,
it
is
a
perfect
example.
i
don't
want
to
be
side-tracked
so
long
on
this
issue,
but
i
would
say
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
every
one
of
these
questions
were
objected
to.
in
every
instance,
the
judge
said
overruled,
this
is
not
a
trial
in
front
of
the
jury,
give
the
information
to
the
prosecutor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
like
to
think
that
you
do,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
think
that
simmons
would
stand
for
that.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
the
problem
that
i
see
is
the
very
difficulty
begins
to
demonstrate
when
they
turn
up
a
witness
as
a
result
of
this
and
they
say,
well,
we
had
this
witness
before,
we
say
well,
you
got
this
witness
as
a
result
--
it
becomes
a
very
difficult
problem.
that
is
the
only
reality,
and
automatic
standing
would
prevent
that
real
proof
problem.
if
i
could
for
a
moment
just
briefly
skip
ahead
to
the
concept
of
prosecutorial
self-incrimination,
and
i
want
to
point
out
in
the
salvucci
brief
that
the
petitioner,
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
salvucci,
they
say
that
self-incrimination
--
i'm
sorry,
the
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
doesn't
really
exist
because
of
instances
like
constructive
possession
and
aiding
and
abetting
are
examples
where
we
get
a
terrible
result.
and
i
would
point
out,
first
of
all,
as
i
said
in
my
reply
brief
in
this
case,
that
aiding
and
abetting
is
not
under
your
past
construction
of
where
automatic
standing
would
apply,
aiding
and
abetting
somebody
else
who
commits
a
possessory
offense
would
not
entitle
someone
to
automatic
standing.
another
example
they
give
construction
possession,
the
very
definition
of
constructive
possession
is
such
a
nexus
between
the
thing
seized
and
the
defendant,
such
dominion
and
control
that
the
defendant
would
almost
have
actual
standing.
so
i
would
say
in
that
situation
there
is
really
no
harm
generated
by
applying
automatic
standing,
and
the
examples
given
by
the
solicitor
general
certainly
do
not
show
a
bad
result
generated
by
the
use
of
automatic
standing
in
those
two
examples.
i
would
next,
if
it
is
permissible
with
the
court,
move
to
the
other
two
theories
that
we
advance
in
this
case
which
are
different
from
the
preceding
case.
the
second
one
is
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
four
theories,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
did.
what
i
am
referring
to
is
the
first
theory
was
automatic
standing.
the
second
one
is
the
ownership
or
possessory
interest
in
the
thing
seized,
that
is,
generates
automatic
standing.
and
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court,
i
hope
i
have
not
in
my
brief
seemed
to
say
that
i
don't
agree
with
your
position
in
rakas.
it
is
not
that.
i
tried
to
say
that
the
reason
i
was
using
the
terms
"automatic
standing"
and
"actual
standing"
is,
even
though
you
did
away
with
those
in
rakas,
the
appellate
courts
of
this
country
as
well
as
the
trial
courts
are
still
fumbling
around,
as
i
am,
with
the
concept
of
what
is
left
over.
i
know
in
rakas
you
said
the
inquiry
would
be
the
same
under
your
new
best,
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
as
it
was
under
the
old
concepts
of
actual
standing,
so
i
tried
to
integrate
the
two
vocabularies
and
i
hope
i
haven't
indicated
that
i
don't
follow
the
reasoning
of
rakas.
in
this
particular
regard,
i
would
say
what
do
we
have
in
this
situation?
this
defendant,
when
he
was
denied
automatic
standing
took
the
stand
and
admitted
ownership
of
the
drugs.
he
outright
said
these
are
my
drugs.
we
say
that,
as
jones
pointed
out
when
it
went
back
historically
and
said
what
is
a
basis
for
establishing
standing,
actual
standing
has
always
been
a
possessory
or
ownership
interest
in
the
premises
searched
or
the
items
seized.
in
this
case,
the
defendant's
interest
in
the
property
that
he
put
in
her
purse
gave
him
the
right
to
complain
about
that
violation,
and
this
is
also,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
sir,
no
more
than
he
could
object
had
she
consented.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this,
that
he
shares
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that's
right,
because
his
privacy
right
and
his
interest
in
the
property
seized
when
he
turns
it
over
to
somebody
else
is
minimized
by
her
ability
to
control
the
use
of
it.
but
that
does
not
do
away
with
either
his
total
expectation
of
privacy
nor
the
fact
that
an
interest
is
generated
by
the
property
seized.
in
this
particular
case
--
as
i
said,
in
the
case
of
a
consent
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
he
had
a
privacy
interest
generated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
storing
something
within
it
with
her
permission.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
there
were
only
two
people
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir,
but
may
i
point
this
out,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
in
the
suppression
hearing
vanessa
cox
did
not
testify.
the
first
suppression
hearing
was
only
officer
railey,
and
then
when
we
were
denied
automatic
standing
then
the
petitioner
testified
and
his
testimony
is
quite
clear.
he
said
i
asked
her
if
i
could
put
these
items
in
her
purse
and
she
said
yes.
there
is
one
place
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
under
redirect
examination
by
the
prosecutor,
a
leading
question,
he
says
did
you
object
when
he
put
the
property
in
there.
i
think
it
is
page
59
of
the
transcript.
and
at
that
point
she
says
yes,
but
if
you
look
at
her
other
testimony,
which
i
have
detailed
in
the
reply
brief,
she
actually
says
at
the
time
he
said
may
i
put
these
items
in
your
purse,
she
said
nothing
with
regard
to
that,
she
doesn't
go
into
anything
like
that,
she
said
he
put
the
items
in
my
purse,
it
was
later
when
i
glanced
in
the
purse
that
i
then
objected.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
he
didn't.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
but
no
court
that
has
looked
at
this
case
has
done
it
on
the
basis
that
vanessa
cox
did
not
give
him
permission
to
put
the
things
in
the
purse,
so
there
has
been
no
question
like
that.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
it
has
been
accepted
through
the
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
they
have
said
that
the
items
were
placed
in
her
purse
with
her
knowledge,
yes.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no
finder
of
fact
has
ever
based
a
decision
to
deny
the
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
not
permission
given.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
because
when
it
started,
your
honor,
the
very
first
thing
that
the
trial
defense
attorney
did
was
say
this
is
a
possessory
offense
alleged
to
have
occurred
and
the
possession
at
the
time
of
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
gives
us
automatic
standing.
that
was
rejected
and
then,
rather
than
give
up
the
claim,
he
went
ahead
and
testified
as
to
his
ownership
of
the
drugs,
generating
both
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir,
it
has
been
presented
all
the
way
through
the
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
on
the
basis
that
he
was
vicariously
asserting
somebody
else's
rights,
that's
exactly
right,
that
even
though
he
was
saying
that
there
were
his
drugs
and
he
admitted
ownership,
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
says
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
he
testified
that
when
he
placed
them
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
in
the
purse
itself?
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
ever
said
that.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
what
happens
is
the
possessory
interest
in
the
thing
that
is
contained
in
the
repository
generates
the
privacy
interest.
it
is
just
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
exactly
right,
nor
would
interest
in
the
purse
have
done
any
good.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
if
it
was
a
legitimate
warrant,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
this
and
i
think
that
your
[illegible
word]
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
i
am
saying
that
we
claimed
a
privacy
interest
in
the
issue
that
were
placed
in
the
purse
and
therefore
the
protection
of
the
purse,
that
is
exactly
right.
we
did
claim
that
all
the
way
through,
and
that
has
been
rejected.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor,
we
are
entitled
to
automatic
standing
unless
you
find
that
automatic
standing
no
longer
exists
and
that
was
rejected,
and
then
we
were
forced
to
take
the
stand
and
admit
ownership,
and
that
is
where
we
have
an
actual
standing,
and
a
reasonable
expectation
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
violated
reasonable
expectation?
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
oh,
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
if
you
look
in
the
brief
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
you
bar
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
exactly
right.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
in
fact
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
is
presented
all
the
way
through
the
proceedings,
your
honor.
page
8
of
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
brief
points
out
that
in
summarizing
the
issues
before
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
they
said
that
the
appellant
also
contends
that
the
search
warrant
for
the
premises
did
not
authorize
the
search
of
all
persons
on
the
premises.
so
it
is
all
the
way
through.
all
of
these
issues
are
properly
before
this
court.
we
have
raised
them
and
each
court
has
ruled
upon
them,
and
this
has
been
no
attempt
to
supplement
it
at
this
level,
our
position.
i
would
just
like
to
ask
this
court
to
consider
with
me
the
very
reality
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
we
would
have.
consider
if
you
were
walking
with
your
spouse
and
you
were
carrying,
for
example,
a
diary
and
it
was
getting
cumbersome
and
you
said
to
your
wife
will
you
put
this
in
your
purse
for
me,
and
she
says
yes,
i
will
put
it
in
the
purse.
are
we
to
believe
that
society
no
longer
would
recognize
your
own
personal
expectation
of
privacy,
even
though
she
is
carrying
that?
if
you
give
to
me
some
of
your
papers
to
carry
in
my
briefcase
because
you
don't
have
a
briefcase
while
we
are
walking
down
the
street,
and
it
is
easier
for
one
of
us
to
carry
it,
have
you
lost
your
right
of
privacy?
clearly,
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
there.
in
the
reply
brief
i
have
cited
for
you
prof.
goffman
in
"relations
in
public,"
talking
about
what
people
expect
with
regard
to
privacy
rights,
and
one
of
the
key
things
is
joint
tenure.
joint
tenure
can
be
generated
in
a
purse,
it
can
be
generated
in
a
briefcase.
and
i
think
your
cases
such
as
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
chadwick
v.
united
states
recognize
that
when
we
talk
about
repository
of
effects,
it
doesn't
mean
that
because
i
place
my
effects
in
someone
else's
repository
that
i
will
necessarily
lose
all
expectation
of
privacy.
if
i
do
it
with
consent,
if
i
do
it
with
their
permission,
then
of
course
i
realize
i
do
it
with
the
limitation
that
they
may
consent,
and
then
i
lose
my
privacy
rights.
but
you
said
in
mancusi
v.
deforte
that
that
didn't
matter
when
it
doesn't
happen
in
the
case,
and
this
woman
did
not
consent.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
sir.
that
did
not
occur
until
--
i
said
that
--
until
after
she
glanced
in
the
purse,
and
david
said,
according
to
her
testimony,
"just
give
ma
second
and
i
will
take
it
out."
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door,
the
police
were
there
and
david
could
not
get
back.
now,
this
is
a
crucial
point.
if
she
really
wanted
him
to
remove
the
information,
remove
the
drugs
from
her
purse,
she
had
45
minutes
while
she
sat
there
with
the
police
and
all
she
had
to
do
at
any
time
was
to
say,
"david,
here
are
the
drugs,"
but
she
didn't
do
that.
she
waited
until
the
police
said
open
up
your
purse,
she
dumped
them
out
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
drugs
are
revealed
and
now
she
says,
"david,
you'd
better
take
what
is
yours."
if
she
really
wanted
him
not
to
have
an
expectation
of
privacy,
then
she
had
45
minutes
while
she
was
right
there
with
the
police
officers
where
she
could
have
said,
"david,
remember
three
minutes
before
they
got
here?
take
the
drugs."
she
didn't
do
that
--
anybody
who
tries
to
say,
such
as
the
respondent
has
in
this
case,
that
she
did
not
agree,
consent,
acquiesce
all
through
that
45-minute
period
of
detention,
of
keeping
those
drugs
in
her
purse,
is
simply
not
dealing
with
the
real
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
noticed
in
criminal
law
reporter
just
recently,
i
can't
remember,
i
think
it
was
the
california
court
that
just
recently
said
you
had
no
expectation
in
a
fast
food
cup,
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
fast
food
cup.
i
would
go
along
with
that.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
arkansas
v.
sanders,
the
very
strong
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
didn't
matter,
that
this
was
a
briefcase
that
was
unlocked,
you
know,
i
think
that
really
fits
quite
well
with
the
purse.
i
think
if
you
will
notice
in
the
goffman
material
that
i
cited
to
you
in
the
reply
brief
from
"relations
in
public,"
they
talk
about
perhaps
even
the
pockets
on
your
raincoat,
you
could
share
that
with
someone
and
they
would
have
an
expectation
or
privacy
with
you.
society
is
ready
to
recognize
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
thought
that
is
what
we
were
talking
about
in
rakas,
was
it
subjectively
reasonable
and
was
it
an
interest
that
society
was
ready
to
recognize.
i
suspect
that
somewhere
between
the
purse
that
is
closed
up
and
not
open
to
view
and
the
paper
cup
from
the
fast
food
company,
we
can
slice
the
onion
in
a
way
that
we
will
know,
but
that
of
course
is
your
job
and
not
mine.thank
you.
