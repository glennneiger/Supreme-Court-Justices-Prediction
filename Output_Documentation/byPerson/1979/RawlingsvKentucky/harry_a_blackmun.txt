justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
they
had
had
a
warrant
to
search
her
purse,
the
fact
that
--
say
they
had
a
warrant
to
search
her
purse
for
stolen
checks.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
they
searched
her
purse
and
found
some
drugs
that
happened
to
belong
to
your
client.
now,
your
client
couldn't
object
to
the
procedure.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
his
interest
in
the
property
seized
isn't
enough.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
if
they
were
legally
in
the
purse,
it
isn't
enough.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
saying
that
his
property
was
seized
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
search
of
a
purse
in
which
he
had
a
joint
interest
or
in
which
he
had
a
privacy
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
she
consent
to
his
placing
this
in
the
purse?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
there
some
dispute
about
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
except
for
simmons,
there
would
be
a
problem
for
the
defendant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
absent
simmons,
what
do
you
think
about
jones?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
under
simmons
that
not
only
any
evidence
at
the
hearing
but
any
fruits
of
that
evidence
would
be
excludable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
--
i
take
it
under
simmons
if
the
defendant
took
the
stand
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
said
i
had
possession
of
these
drugs,
that
that
would
be
excludable
at
his
trial.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
he
said
some
other
things
that
gave
the
prosecution
some
hints
and
they
tracked
down
some
other
evidence
as
a
result
of
what
they
heard
at
the
suppression
hearing
from
the
defendant,
do
you
think
under
simmons
that
all
those
things
are
excludable,
too?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn't
there
something
to
what
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
about
the
dangers
of
overruling
that
part
of
jones?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
fox,
let
me
ask
you
something.
suppose
the
officers
had
shown
up
at
the
house
here
with
a
search
warrant
and
were
going
to
search
the
house
for
a
stolen
piano
and
they
decided
that,
well,
now
that
they
had
found
everybody
here
they
will
just
search
them.
i
suppose
--
let's
suppose
they
searched
in
a
drawer
for
a
stolen
piano
and
found
some
drugs
and
it
just
turned
out
that
the
drugs
belonged
to
this
particular
defendant.
he
wouldn't
need
any
automatic
standing
to
question
that,
would
he?
rakas
didn't
say
that
that
part
of
jones
is
reversed,
that
a
guest
in
the
house
has
got
some
interest
in
privacy
in
the
house.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sure.
sure,
but
couldn't
he?
"i'm
a
guest
in
the
house."
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sure,
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
says,
"i
was
a
guest
in
the
house."
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
they
seized
my
drugs,
wouldn't
you
say
that
is
excludable?
wouldn't
you
say
that
he
would
win?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
he
gets
it
excluded.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
it
is
a
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
right,
it
is
a
warrantless
search
of
a
house
in
which
he
has
a
privacy
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
exactly.
now,
tell
me
why
in
this
case
isn't
that
situation
present
when
the
officers
show
up
with
a
search
warrant
and
the
search
warrant
doesn't
authorize
searching
anybody
in
the
house,
but
they
do
search
somebody
in
the
house?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
didn't
search
the
lady
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
waited
until
they
had
a
search
warrant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
isn't
so,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not?
the
warrant
just
didn't
authorize
searching
people.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i
am
asking
you
whether
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
on
the
premises.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
he
was
a
guest
there
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
assume
he
was.
assume
that
he
was
exactly
like
the
person
in
my
example
with
the
piano.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
didn't
have
his
drugs
in
a
dresser
drawer,
he
had
his
drugs
in
the
lady's
purse.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
right.
i
would
agree
with
you
that
if
he
didn't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises,
then
my
piano
example
is
irrelevant.
but
if
he
did
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
my
example
is
very
relevant,
and
your
answer
is
very
damaging.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
did
the
search
warrant
cover,
by
the
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
what?
what
did
it
list,
marijuana,
they
wanted
to
search
for
marijuana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
isn't?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
why
did
they
ever
go
get
a
warrant?
i
thought
it
was
because
they
smelled
marijuana
or
drugs
or
something.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
mean
the
search
warrant
isn't
a
part
of
the
printed
record
or
isn't
a
part
of
the
record
that
was
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
can
you
get
it
from
a
lower
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
warrant
for
--
if
you
have
a
warrant
that
authorizes
you
to
search
a
premises
for
marijuana,
you
can
look
almost
anywhere
on
the
premises
for
marijuana.
i
think
you
could
look
behind
doors,
you
could
look
in
jewel
boxes,
and
you
probably,
if
you
just
saw
a
purse
sitting
in
the
corner
somewhere,
you
could
search
the
purse.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why?
let's
assume
that
--
you
would
certainly
search
boxes
that
you
found.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
court
below
in
this
case
said
that
although
warrants
do
not
ordinarily
authorize
the
search
of
persons
in
a
room,
the
search
of
this
purse
wasn't
the
search
of
a
person.
it
was
just
like
searching
any
other
containers
on
the
premises
for
marijuana.
now,
i
take
it
you
don't
agree
with
that,
although
that
is
what
your
court
said.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you've
abandoned
that
part
of
the
trial
court's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
we
agree
with
you
on
your
automatic
standing
theory,
we
have
to
reach
in
order
to
affirm,
we
still
have
to
reach
any
other
fourth
amendment
issue
that
is
fairly
before
us.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
we
have
to
answer
the
questions
that
he
raises
in
his
petition
for
certiorari.
