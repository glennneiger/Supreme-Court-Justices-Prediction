mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
about
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
about
going
back
to
virginia
for
a
permanent
disability
award.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
any
further
benefits
under
the
virginia
statue.
it
would
just
have
been
a
question
of
whether
they
were
called
temporary
or
permanent.
but
even
under
permanent
disability,
his
benefits
would
have
run
out.
these
are
benefits
that
are
not
paid
by
virginia.
they
are
paid
by
the
employer,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
correct.
virginia
provides
fewer
benefits
than
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
had
he
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia
initially
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
under
the
statute
as
it
was
written
at
the
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
as
a
consequence
of
a
virginia
workmen's
compensation
award
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
bars
the
district
of
columbia
from
making
an
award
to
petitioner
under
its
own
worker's
compensation
statute.
now,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
already
answered
the
constitutional
question
presented
here
in
the
mccartin
case,
and
that
that
decision
compels
reversal
in
this
case.
mccartin
held
two
things
first,
it
held
that
a
worker's
compensation
award
in
one
state
was
not
necessarily
preclusive
of
a
worker's
compensation
award
in
a
second
state
that
supplemented
the
first
award,
but
that
the
preclusive
effect
depended
upon
the
intent
of
the
first
state
in
granting
its
award.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct,
but
it
does
not
have
to
give
any
greater
effect.
virginia
did
not
intend
to
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
believe
so.
if
i
understand
what
is
troubling
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
the
question
of
whether
we
look
at
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
virginia
award
in
virginia
or
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
virginia
award
in
the
district
of
columbia.
is
that
accurate?
the
district
of
columbia
only
has
to
give
the
virginia
award
the
preclusive
effect
that
virginia
would
give
it.
virginia
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
quite
correct.
now,
in
this
case
there
is
a
question
of
whether
the
virginia
award
is
intended
by
virginia
to
preclude
awards
under
the
district
of
columbia
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
agree,
but
the
question
is
what
does
the
virginia
award
mean
in
virginia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
in
virginia,
the
virginia
courts
would
not
hear
a
claim
under
the
district
of
columbia
statute,
so
there
is
no
way
to
tell,
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
case
law
to
tell
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
we
can
treat
it
as
if
he
had
gotten
his
award
in
virginia
and
it
had
been
called
a
permanent
disability
award.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
suppose
he
had
gone
to
virginia
and
gotten
a
permanent
disability
award
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first
of
all,
on
the
question
of
virginia
law,
there
is
a
dispute.
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
hold
that
under
mccartin
the
virginia
statute
possessed
the
unmistakable
language
referred
to
in
mccartin
and
that
it
thereby
barred
second
awards.
what
we
contend
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
misinterpreted
mccartin.
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
in
pettus
does
not
deal
with
mccartin
in
much
detail
but
simply
says
that
mccartin
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
magnolia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
true,
the
fourth
circuit
was
divided
on
pettus.
moreover,
another
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
has
stated
in
a
case
that
is
distinguishable
on
its
facts
that
the
intent
of
the
virginia
statute
is
not
to
preclude
a
district
of
columbia
award.
moreover,
the
d.c.
circuit
has
also
held
that
the
virginia
statute
does
not
have
thus
effect,
explicitly
rejecting
the
decision
in
pettus.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
defer
to
the
fourth
circuit
because
the
court
specified
in
mccartin
what
the
rule
of
construction
was
for
interpreting
these
worker's
compensation
statutes
when
they
don't
specifically
address
the
question
of
an
award
under
another
state's
statute,
and
that
rule
of
construction
is
that
the
state
must
specify
by
unmistakable
language
that
it
intends
to
bar
such
an
award.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
consider
that.
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
deal
with
mccartin's
injunction
on
that
point.
the
fourth
circuit
simply
said
that
mccartin
has
no
application
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right,
and
i
think
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
am
saying
that
they
misinterpreted
mccartin.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
and
so
they
did
not
interpret
--
they
made
no
attempt
to
interpret
the
virginia
statute
in
line
as
prescribed
by
this
court
in
mccartin.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
decision
in
pettus
as
far
as
the
interpretation
of
virginia
law
is
entitled
to
much
deference
by
this
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
longshoremen's
act
that
appeal
should
be
to
the
circuit
where
the
injury
occurred.
there
is
some
dispute
over
exactly
what
that
means,
whether
it
means
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
or
to
interpret
it
literally,
where
the
injury
occurred,
but
that
was
not
disputed
in
this
case.
again,
mccartin
sets
out
a
rule
of
construction
that
the
virginia
statute
must
state
in
unmistakable
language
that
it
intends
to
preclude
the
district
of
columbia
award.
now,
the
virginia
statute
here
contains
no
unmistakable
language.
indeed,
it
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
that
was
construed
by
this
court
in
mccartin,
the
illinois
statute.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
the
virginia
statute
gives
us
any
suggestion
at
all
about
its
views
on
supplemental
awards,
we
understand
that
virginia
permits
supplemental
awards
in
its
own
courts.
that
is,
if
the
petitioner
here
had
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia
first
and
gotten
an
award
that
was
less
than
what
he
was
entitled
to
in
virginia,
it
is
clear
from
the
virginia
statute
that
he
could
have
gone
to
virginia
and
supplemented
that
award
up
to
the
benefits
that
virginia
allows
under
its
statute.
so
what
respondent
is
asking
for
is
an
extremely
arrogant
interpretation
of
the
virginia
statute
and
that
is
that
virginia
expects
other
states
to
honor
the
limitations
that
virginia
puts
on
its
awards,
but
virginia
will
not
honor
such
limitations
by
other
states,
and
that
virginia
expects
other
states
to
permit
virginia
to
give
supplemental
awards,
yet
virginia
will
not
permit
other
states
to
give
their
supplemental
awards.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
interest
--
it
is
conceivable
that
virginia
might
have
decided
that
it
was
better
not
to
have
supplemental
awards,
that
they
prefer
the
limitations,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
have
expressed
themselves
on
that,
they
have
shown
that
their
interest
is
in
providing
supplemental
awards,
that
is
that
the
stronger
interest
is
to
compensate
the
injured
employees.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct,
that
it
just
would
not
want
to
restrict
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
certainly
has
no
direct
economic
interest.
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct,
in
a
case
where
there
is
jurisdiction
of
both
states.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
now,
to
the
extent
that
virginia
might
have
an
interest
and
somehow
having
a
limitation
where
there
is
jurisdiction
in
two
states,
which
is
what
the
respondent
is
suggesting,
that
is
an
interest
that
they
cannot
vindicate
unless
the
injured
employee
makes
a
mistake
in
the
first
instance
and
goes
to
virginia.
i
mean
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
petitioner
could
have
gone
directly
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
gotten
all
the
benefits
that
he
is
entitled
to
under
the
district
of
columbia
act.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
he
was
a
resident
and
because
the
respondent
is
an
employer
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
the
washington
gas
light
company.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
in
fact
he
went
to
virginia.
as
it
happened,
he
signed
a
memorandum
agreement
with
respondent
after
two
weeks
and
that
award
was
just
approved
by
the
virginia
industrial
commission
and
it
then
takes
on
the
force
of
an
award
in
virginia.
he
didn't
--
it
is
true
that
he
went
to
virginia.
the
way
the
worker's
compensation
system
works,
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
choice
that
a
litigant
makes
when
he
chooses
to
go
to
a
particular
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
forced
to
sign
the
award.
it
is
certainly
probable
that
he
had
no
idea
that
he
had
any
rights
under
the
district
of
columbia
statute
at
that
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
think
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
settled
by
mccartin
if
this
court
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
the
court
is
going
to
reconsider
mccartin.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
case?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
is
always
a
statutory
issue
as
to
whether
the
virginia
statute
intends
to
preclude
a
d.c.
award.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
respondent
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
to
the
scope
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
was
apparently
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
conceded
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
it
was
not
passed
on.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
court
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
felt
that
it
wasn't
raised
below,
they
didn't
say.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
administrative
hearing.
it
was
conceded
in
the
administrative
hearing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
was
a
contention
that
the
d.c.
law
did
not
apply
because
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
at
the
administrative
hearing
they
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
was
conceded
at
the
administrative
hearing,
that
there
was
no
contention
that
the
district
of
columbia
act
would
not
have
applied
if
it
were
not
for
the
virginia
award.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
all
the
monies
that
are
paid
out
are
paid
out
by
the
employer.
the
state
is
not
the
employer.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
the
district
of
columbia
award
would
give
credit
for
the
monies
paid
out
in
virginia.
there
is
no
issue
of
double
recovery
here.
the
employee
is
only
receiving
what
he
would
have
gotten
had
he
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
first
place.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
under
the
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
no,
that
is
not
a
correct
ruling.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
the
longshoremen's
act
does
not
restrict
its
recoveries
to
cases
that
are
not
covered
under
other
state
laws,
and
that
contention
of
respondents
is
incorrect.
it
was
rejected
back
in
the
1940's
by
the
d.c.
circuit
and
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
anything
about
it.
i
think
perhaps
they
implicitly
rejected
it.
they
may
have
thought
it
was
insubstantial.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
but
technically
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
court
might
want
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
the
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
if
they
rejected
it.
they
didn't
consider
it
apparently.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
this
court
has
not
decided
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
was
a
question
prior
to
mccartin
as
to
whether
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
would
bar
this
award
simply
because
an
award
was
made
in
virginia
and
virginia
has
a
general
exclusivity
provision
that
makes
that
award
exclusive.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
for
these
purposes
it
would
be.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
ties
both
the
constitution
implementing
statute
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
and
they
are
practically
coextensive.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
also
simply
a
statutory
question
and
that
is
what
does
the
virginia
statute
say.
it
is
only
if
the
court
is
going
to
reconsider
mccartin
that
it
has
to
worry
about
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reconsider
magnolia
in
this
case.
whether
it
is
possible
in
another
case
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
suggested
that
other
--
we
were
trying
to
have
the
court
not
step
back
from
the
mccartin
rationale
and
in
support
of
that
we
have
noted
that
some
commentators
have
suggested
that
even
magnolia
was
wrong
and
that
is
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
of
the
nature
of
workmen's
compensation
actions
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--
that
the
state
never
considers
the
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
if
you
were
to
reach
that
argument,
but
there
is
no
need
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
i
thought
it
was
supportive
of
the
notion
that
mccartin
was
correct.
mccartin
sets
up
a
rule
of
construction
that
permits
the
magnolia
result
only
when
the
state
has
made
it
quite
it
quite
explicit.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
except
that
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
and
so
the
question
of
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
so
the
question
is
whether
the
virginia
award
would
preclude
the
d.c.
award.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
because
virginia
never
considers
d.c.
awards,
you
can't
tell
that
from
what
happens
in
virginia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
provision
that
is
in
the
virginia
law
is
practically
identical
to
the
provision
that
was
in
the
illinois
law
that
was
considered
in
mccartin.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct,
although
the
magnolia
case
had
the
extra
feature
which
the
court
specifically
relied
on,
that
the
state
of
texas
did
not
permit
its
own
courts
to
give
supplemental
awards,
whereas
here
virginia
does
permit
its
courts
to
give
supplemental
awards.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
that
is
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
magnolia
finding,
that
texas
--
in
magnolia,
the
court
did
not
specifically
on
this
language
but
they
found
that
texas
did
not
permit
its
awards
--
did
not
permit
another
state
to
give
supplemental
awards.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
it
could.
we
cited
the
nevada
statute
in
our
brief
which
is
quite
explicit.
it
says
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
it
is
unique.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
is
unique
because
states
have
no
interest
in
restricting
supplemental
awards
in
other
states,
and
some
of
the
state
haven't
done
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
virginia.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
because
that
was
under
the
worker's
compensation
statute.
what
this
language
does
is
bar
other
remedies
other
than
worker's
compensation,
and
the
question
is
does
that
bar
other
remedies
other
than
the
virginia
worker's
compensation
or
does
it
not
bar
remedies
under
another
state's
workers
compensation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
what
it
states.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
this
language
bars
other
remedies
even
before
there
is
an
award.
what
this
does
is
it
forces
the
employee
to
go
within
the
worker's
compensation
system.
he
can't
sue
in
tort.
he
can't
bring
any
other
remedy.
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
effect
of
the
virginia
award.
now,
it
is
not
intended,
because
it
is
clear
that
virginia
would
not
have
the
power
to
prevent
the
employee
from
going
to
d.c.
initially
and
getting
an
award,
yet
theoretically
this
language
would
also
prevent
that.
so
i
do
think
it
is
clear
that
this
language
is
not
specifically
aimed
at
an
award
under
another
state's
statute
and
that
is
what
mccartin
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
this
case
it
is
paid
directly
by
his
employer.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
under
the
nevada
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
is
some
tension,
they
are
not
satisfied
as
a
theoretical
conflicts
of
law
problem.
they
have
some
of
the
difficulty
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has,
and
that
is
that
it
should
not
make
that
much
of
a
difference
what
virginia
says
about
the
extraterritorial
--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
mccartin
case
severely
limited
magnolia
and
the
magnolia
case
can
still
come
up,
it
can
still
come
up
in
nevada,
but
the
fact
is
there
is
no
policy
for
a
state
to
have
such
a
statute
so
it
is
unlikely
that
this
court
will
ever
be
faced
with
the
need
to
overrule
magnolia
or
with
that
question.
thank
you.
