we
will
hear
argument
next
in
thomas
v.
washington
gas
light
company.
mr.
green,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
green.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
virginia,
he
received
compensation
for
total
but
not
permanent
disability,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
totally
but
not
permanent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
claim
now
is
that
he
is
permanently
disabled.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
his
claim
foreclosed
in
virginia
for
permanent
disability?
in
other
words,
has
he
no
residual
rights
when
it
developed
that
his
temporary
disability
was
apparently
a
permanent
disability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
having
a
little
difficulty
reconciling
your
two
answers
just
on
the
factual
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
why
i
put
the
question,
because
i
was
confused
as
to
the
reality.
could
he
have
got
an
award
for
total
and
permanent
in
virginia
if
he
had
ignored
the
district
of
columbia
entirely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
virginia
have
any
economic
interest
or
any
other
kind
of
interest
in
being
concerned
about
how
much
money
someone
else
pays
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whatever
some
other
state
--
whatever
is
achieved
in
some
other
state
relieves
any
tension
or
pressure
for
virginia
to
expand
its
awards,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
possibility
here
that
if
a
total
and
permanent
award
were
made
in
the
district
of
columbia,
virginia
could
recover
from
what
it
has
paid
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
meant
to
say
the
employer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
wouldn't
give
him
any
more
money
is
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
baldwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
the
consequence
of
an
appeal
of
the
virginia
award,
if
i
understood
you
correctly
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
it?
what
would
have
been
appealed
from
the
virginia
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
there
is
no
consequence
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
all
the
time
is
consumed.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
