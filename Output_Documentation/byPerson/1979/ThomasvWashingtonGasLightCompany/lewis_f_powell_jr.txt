well,
the
nevada
statute
is
unique,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
among
the
fifty
states.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
bars
all
other
remedies
at
common
law
or
otherwise.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
pretty
broad
language.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
why
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
involved
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
like
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but

go
back
in
virginia
and

an
award
for
permanent
disability?

or
wrongly,

agreed
with
your
colleagues

is
the
same,
he
could
have
gone
back
--
virginia
just
didn't
bar
going
back
and
getting
an
award
for
permanent
disability,
even
though
there
had
been
an
award
for
temporary
total
disability.
suppose
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know,
but
suppose
--
i
heard
that
from
the
other
side,
and
you
heard
it,
too.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
say
that
is
wrong.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
suppose
they
were
right
in
what
they
said?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
don't
want
to
suppose?
all
right.
