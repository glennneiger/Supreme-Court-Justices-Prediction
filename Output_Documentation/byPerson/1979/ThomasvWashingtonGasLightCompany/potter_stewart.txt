justice
potter
stewart
i
perhaps
misunderstood
this
situation,
but
i
thought
the
fact
was
that
he
has
now
been
paid
all
that
he
could
be
paid
under
the
virginia
workmen's
compensation
act
for
--
even
for
total
permanent
disability.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
one
concedes
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
fact
is
that
he
has
gotten
all
that
he
could
possibly
get
under
the
virginia
system
and
all
that
somebody
who
didn't
have
even
a
potential
choice
of
going
into
another
jurisdiction
system,
all
that
such
a
person
could
possibly
get.
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
received,
hasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
had
a
virginia
employer
and
been
injured
in
virginia
and
had
no
connection
with
any
other
jurisdiction
and
had
been
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
this
is
all
he
could
ever
get
under
the
virginia
system,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
as
it
was
then
written.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
wholly
at
odds
with
accepted
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
the
intent,
it
is
what
effect
the
home
state
would
give
that
judgment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
foreign
state
must
give
the
same
effect.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
you
wouldn't
concede
that
the
statement
of
the
court
in
mccartin
was
a
little
bit
at
odds
with
normally
accepted
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
potter
stewart
it
only
has
to
give
it
that
and
under
full
faith
and
credit
it
must
give
it
that.
justice
potter
stewart
under
ordinary
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine,
it
is
not
that
the
law
of
virginia
says
we
want
to
make
very
clear
that
this
must
be
given
effect
in
other
jurisdictions.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
virginia
is
not
concerned
about
awards
elsewhere,
one
would
think
that
it
isn't
concerned
about
its
own
allocation
of
awards.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
90
percent
or
more
of
the
industrial
accidents
in
virginia,
an
injured
person
wouldn't
have
a
choice
of
two
jurisdictions.
isn't
that
your
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
the
two
first
arguments
made
by
your
brother.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
longshoremen's
act
permits
a
longshoremen's
award
if
a
state
has
granted
an
award.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
horowitz,
before
you
sit
down,
you
said
there
was
a
constitutional
question.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
is
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
district
of
columbia
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
has
that
ever
been
held?
i
was
just
wondering
if
it
is
a
statutory
question
rather
than
a
constitutional
question.
it
is
a
statutory
question
identical
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
we
may
not
have
the
problem
mr.
justice
white
suggests
of
needing
to
address
some
other
statutory
question
before
this
statutory
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right,
but
this
one
does
not
read
on
the
constitution
and
that
is
why
you
needed
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
quite
contrary,
as
i
suggested
at
the
outset
in
my
question,
from
ordinarily
accepted
doctrine
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
duty
of
a
foreign
jurisdiction
to
give
precisely
the
same
effect
as
the
local
jurisdiction
would
give
to
that
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
what
the
legislature
might
have
said.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
a
question.
i
have
before
me
section
65.1-40
of
the
virginia
code
and
i
will
read
this
language
and
then
ask
you
a
question.
i
have
it
at
page
4a
i
think
of
respondents'
brief,
in
the
appendix
in
the
back
of
the
brief
"the
rights
and
remedies
herein
granted
to
an
employee...
shall
exclude
all
other
rights
and
remedies
of
such
employee...at
common
law
or
otherwise..."
now,
you
rely
on
the
mccartin
case
as
holding
that
a
state
statute
must
explicitly
exclude
all
other
remedies.
what
language
would
you
suggest
to
meet
your
own
standard
beyond
what
is
presently
in
the
virginia
law?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
said,
if
i
recall,
in
pettus
that
it
was
practically
identical
with
the
statute
before
the
court
in
magnolia.
justice
potter
stewart
you
rely
solely
on
that
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
putting
that
aside,
could
a
state
statute
be
any
more
explicit
than
65.1-40?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
you
suggest
in
summary
as
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
isn't
the
usual
rule
under
the
longshoremen's
act
though,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
there
now
currently
an
overlap
between
the
state
laws
and
the
longshoremen's
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
it
happened.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
that
getting
a
recovery
under
state
law
precluded
a
recovery
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
"any
other
common
law
judgment,"
this
is
not
a
common
law
judgment,
is
it?
it
is
a
workmen's
compensation
award.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
precludes
common
law
remedies.
