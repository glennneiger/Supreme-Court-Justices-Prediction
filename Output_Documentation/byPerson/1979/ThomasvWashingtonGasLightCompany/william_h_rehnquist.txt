justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
consider
to
be
the
holding
as
you
described
it
in
mccartin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
a
good
deal
of
what
you
have
just
said
dicta
rather
than
a
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
court
can
write
a
ten-page
opinion
and
say
we
hold
that
in
every
paragraph
and
that
still
doesn't
make
each
paragraph
a
holding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fourth
circuit
certainly
knows
more
about
virginia
law
than
we
do.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
have
to
choose
between
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
virginia
law
and
the
d.c.
circuit's
interpretation
of
virginia
law,
ordinarily
we
would
defer
to
the
fourth
circuit
rather
than
the
d.c.
circuit,
wouldn't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
have
three
judges
sitting
down
in
richmond
who
are
presumably
familiar
with
the
cases
they
are
talking
about,
they
talk
about
mccartin
and
they
say
mccartin
does
not
control
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
may
be
wrong,
but
if
you
are
saying
that
they
misinterpreted
virginia
law,
i
think
you
are
leading
on
a
rather
weak
reed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
be
another
question,
but
they
didn't
understand
what
mccartin
told
them
they
had
to
find
in
order
to
do
what
they
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
fact
he
went
to
virginia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
one
forced
him
to
sign
the
award,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
issue
here
constitutional
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
statutory
issue
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
on
the
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
just
had
a
two-paragraph
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
sat
on
the
pettus
result.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
statutory
question
was
implicitly
rejected,
we
should
reach
it
first
here?
is
that
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
told
me
they
rejected
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
this
court
has
never
decided
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
an
award,
you
are
talking
about
something
that
is
ultimately
paid
for
by
a
tax
on
his
employer,
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
worker
go
to
nevada,
for
instance,
and
get
an
award?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
commentators
in
the
academic
world
think
there
is
a
bit
of
tension
between
magnolia
and
mccartin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
change
in
the
chief
justice
and
the
later
case
was
unanimous
with
only
one
justice
concurring
in
the
result.
the
other
one
was
a
very
bare
majority
and
a
tenuous
one
at
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
have
supporting
you
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
pattus
at
631
of
deciding
where
they
say,
turning
to
the
virginia
statute,
we
find
it
as
exclusive
of
the
second
proceeding
as
the
chief
justice
in
magnolia
found
the
texas
law?
