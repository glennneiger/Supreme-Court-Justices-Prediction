mr.
james
f.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
halley
i.
thomas,
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
since
1949,
was
hired
in
1970
as
a
heavy
laborer
by
the
washington
gas
light
company
in
their
employment
office
in
washington,
d.
c.
although
mr.
thomas
occasionally
worked
in
the
neighboring
jurisdictions
of
virginia
and
maryland,
approximately
60
percent
of
his
duties
were
performed
in
the
district
of
columbia.
for
his
endeavors,
mr.
thomas
received
a
paycheck
drawn
upon
a
district
of
columbia
bank.
on
january
22,
1971,
mr.
thomas
was
breaking
concrete
with
an
air
hammer
in
arlington,
virginia,
when
he
sustained
a
disabling
injury
to
his
back.
since
that
date,
mr.
thomas
has
been
unable
to
return
to
his
occupation.
prior
to
his
being
represented
by
counsel,
mr.
thomas,
while
still
hospitalized,
signed
a
virginia
agreement
for
temporary
total
disability
benefits
under
the
virginia
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
thomas
received
the
virginia
benefits
until
the
maximum
amount
payable
under
virginia
law.
mr.
thomas
is
currently
without
any
disability
compensation
and
medical
coverage.
mr.
thomas
pursued
permanent
and
total
disability
benefits
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
received
an
award
which
has
never
been
honored.
the
court
is
today
presented
with
two
independent
statutory
schemes,
each
of
which
has
as
its
purpose
the
compensation
of
injured
workers.
the
statutes
concerned
are
those
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
the
compensation
statutes
in
both
of
these
jurisdictions
create
administrative
remedies.
the
respective
administrative
fora
do
not
look
north
or
south
or
east
or
west
to
determine
whether
a
given
person
is
entitled
to
compensation
in
that
forum.
mr.
james
f.
green
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
green
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
green
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
f.
green
that
is
correct.
that
claim
was
presented
to
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
james
f.
green
your
honor,
the
question
of
permanent
and
total
disability
was
never
resolved
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
that
claim
--
mr.
james
f.
green
because
the
benefits
in
the
district
of
columbia
after
mr.
thomas
obtained
counsel
were
more
generous
to
mr.
thomas,
and
a
claim
was
initiated
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
permanent
and
total
disability
benefits.
mr.
james
f.
green
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
do
not
misunderstand
what
he
has
been
paid.
he
has
been
paid
the
extent
of
the
virginia
award
as
it
was
then
enacted
in
1971.
mr.
james
f.
green
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
f.
green
he
has
been
paid
that
amount,
the
point
being
that
they
continue
to
pay
the
virginia
award
even
after
the
district
of
columbia
had
granted
thomas'
claim
for
permanent
and
total
disability;
an
award
was
entered,
they
never
paid
the
award.
mr.
james
f.
green
let
me
see
if
i
can
--
mr.
james
f.
green
and
my
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
have
been
he
could
have
pursued
such
a
remedy
in
virginia.
the
virginia
statutory
scheme
left
open
to
thomas
a
claim
for
additional
relief
beyond
temporary
total
disability.
he
elected
not
to
pursue
the
permanent
total
disability
claim
in
virginia
and
pursued
that
claim
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
judgment
which
has
never
been
honored.
the
virginia
award
continued
to
be
paid
until
it
ran
out
in
the
summer
of
1978,
july
of
1978.
mr.
james
f.
green
he
would
have
been
able
in
virginia
to
pursue
under
a
separate
statutory
policy
permanent
disability,
that
is
permanent
and
total
disability,
although
it
is
not
captioned
as
such
in
virginia,
under
their
statute
he
could
have
--
mr.
james
f.
green
he
received
an
award,
a
voluntary
award
for
temporary
total
disability.
mr.
james
f.
green
yes.
mr.
james
f.
green
it
would
be
our
position
that
he
could
have,
mr.
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
james
f.
green
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
would
not
have
obtained
any
more
money
because
the
virginia
statue
at
that
time
--
mr.
james
f.
green
that
is
why
he
came
to
d.
c.,
sir,
that
was
the
election
and
he
made
it
and
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
brought
his
action
and
received
the
award
which
has
not
been
honored.
mr.
james
f.
green
not
just
the
money
--
mr.
james
f.
green
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
not
just
the
money
but
also
the
medical
benefits.
in
virginia,
the
statutory
scheme
in
1971
allowed
for
a
termination
of
medical
care
to
an
injured
worker
when
the
money
ran
out.
the
district
of
columbia
has
no
such
statutory
policy.
under
section
907
of
title
33
of
the
u.s.
code,
the
man
could
obtain
his
benefits
for
medical
care
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
long
as
he
was
still
disabled
from
that
industrial
accident.
the
petitioner
would
state
that
you
do
not
have
to
reach
a
question
of
full
faith
and
credit
in
order
to
determine
this
case,
because
the
controversy
involved
does
not
bring
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution
to
bear
on
these
issues.
what
it
does
do
is
it
suggests
that
this
court's
holding
in
mccartin
is
correct,
that
the
virginia
statute
is
not
so
exclusive
as
to
preclude
thomas'
claim
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
james
f.
green
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
consider
the
holding
to
be
that
in
a
statutory
scheme
where
a
state
allows
for
recovery
by
an
injured
worker
having
only
limited
demands
prior
common
law
right
to
sue
his
employer
through
that
statutory
scheme,
he
can
bring
an
additional
action
in
any
state
or
any
forum
in
which
he
desires
to
do
so,
allowing
certain
constitutional
contacts
that
would
give
him
the
right
to
bring
that
claim.
mr.
james
f.
green
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
i
believe
that
the
court
repeated
twice
in
mccartin,
after
discussing
the
reservation
of
the
contractual
right
that
they
found
that
the
illinois
statute
or
a
statutory
scheme
similar
to
illinois,
like
those,
we
would
allow
those
statutory
schemes
to
not
be
preclusive
and
to
not
be
exclusive
so
that
the
man
cannot
bring
additional
claim
for
benefits.
mr.
james
f.
green
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
is
not
dicta
in
mccartin,
that
it
is
the
rule
of
mccartin
and
has
been
so
interpreted.
since
this
court
came
with
the
mccartin
decision,
the
progeny
of
mccartin
are
throughout
this
country
and,
as
we
have
cited
on
brief,
they
are
numerous.
they
understand
the
court
to
have
said
in
that
decision
that
unless
a
statutory
scheme
is
exclusive,
the
man
can
bring
an
additional
claim
for
relief
in
any
forum
in
which
he
has
a
right
to
bring
such
a
claim.
the
aggregate
of
that
claim
is
a
set
amount.
it
cannot
be
more
generous
than
the
most
generous
forum.
that
is
what
we
would
urge
this
court
to
consider,
that
your
announcement
in
mccartin
controls
this
case,
not
magnolia.
and
because
it
does,
the
virginia
exclusive
remedy
provision
is
only
exclusive
as
to
a
common
law
right
to
sue
your
employer
and
is
exclusive
for
no
other
purpose.
and
because
it
is
not,
a
man
has
a
right
to
bring
a
claim
in
multiple
jurisdictions.
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
