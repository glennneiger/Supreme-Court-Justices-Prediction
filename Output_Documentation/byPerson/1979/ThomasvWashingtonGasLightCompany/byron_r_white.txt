and
what
would
it
have
been
open
to
him
to
pursue
in
virginia
after
his
initial
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
he
get
an
award
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
temporary
total.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
could
have
pursued
another
award
for
permanent
in
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
what
it
is
worth,
the
fourth
circuit
was
divided
in
pettus.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
was
a
resident
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
like
a
1983
case,
a
purely
statutory
claim
but
reads
right
on
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
suggest
in
your
brief
that
we
might
reconsider
both
magnolia
and
mccartin
to
the
extent
of
being
persuaded
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution
and
its
supplementary
statute
have
nothing
to
do
with
workmen's
compensation
awards
or
that
workmen's
compensation
awards
are
an
exception.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
it
on
page
26
of
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution
or
its
equivalent
statute
are
simply
inapplicable
to
workmen's
compensation
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
require
reexamination
of
both
magnolia
and
mccartin,
at
least
as
to
their
underlying
premises.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
did
you
put
it
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
going
to
mention
mccartin?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
you
are
going
to,
are
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
later
of
the
two
cases,
and
i
would
like
to
know
how
you
