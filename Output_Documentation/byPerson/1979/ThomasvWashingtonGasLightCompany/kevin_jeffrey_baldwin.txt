mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
could
have
and
should
have
dismissed
this
case
on
the
non-constitutional
grounds
that
the
district
of
columbia
did
not
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
independent
of
that
the
claim
was
untimely
filed.
we
have
learned
that
mr.
thomas
was
employed
by
the
gas
company
out
of
our
springfield,
virginia
offices.
he
was
injured
in
arlington,
virginia
in
january
of
'71.
in
february,
the
parties
executed
a
memorandum
agreement,
they
submitted
it
to
the
virginia
industrial
commission.
a
month
and
a
half
later
the
commission
comes
down
with
an
award.
two
years
later
he
retains
counsel
and
three
and
a
half
years
later
a
claim
is
maid
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
regard
to
jurisdiction,
in
1928,
congress
incorporated
the
federal
longshoremen's
act
in
toto
as
the
district
of
columbia
workmen's
compensation
act.
the
act
provides
coverage
for
jurisdiction
for
injuries
on
navigable
waters
and
if
compensation
cannot
be
validly
had
in
a
state.
another
provision
provides
that
coverage
is
available
irrespective
of
the
place
of
injury.
this
provision
can
be
read
and
harmonized
with
the
federal
coverage
to
read
that
coverage
is
afforded
irrespective
of
the
place
of
injury
and
if
compensation
cannot
validly
be
had
in
the
state.
thomas
was
injured
in
virginia,
he
received
and
validly
received
compensation
from
virginia.
congressional
hearings
tell
us
that
the
d.c.
act
was
to
fill
a
void.
there
was
no
recovery
for
d.c.
employees
working
for
d.c.
employers
who
were
injured
on
the
job
in
the
district
of
columbia.
if
they
were
injured
outside
the
district
of
columbia,
they
were
covered
by
state
compensation
laws.
congress
filled
this
void
with
a
mutually
exclusive
federal
act.
it
was
a
very
restrictive
act
and
it
clearly
intended
to
give
the
employees
of
the
district
of
columbia
one
remedy,
not
as
suggested
by
our
opponents,
two
remedies.
in
regard
to
timeliness
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
your
honor,
in
1928
the
longshoremen's
act
came
after
a
rather
hard
line
of
cases,
the
jensen
case
and
then
back
up
to
1942
where
this
court,
speaking
through
justice
black,
described
these
early
cases
as
employees
being
caught
in
a
twilight
zone,
that
is
pursuing
a
state
remedy
and
then
being
unable
to
recover
under
a
one-year
statute.
also
in
this
time
era
the
cases
were
thought
to
be
maritime
national
versus
maritime
local.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
by
overlap
do
you
mean
today
or
do
you
mean
when
this
accident
happened?
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
there
is
no
overlap
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
is
not
--
this
court,
decided
in
1969
the
nacirema
case
where
an
employee
fell
off
a
ship
onto
a
pier
and
it
refused
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
to
the
really
doesn't
apply
because
mr.
thomas
was
injured
in
arlington,
virginia,
and
the
overlap
question
doesn't
pertain
to
this
case.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
yes,
it
was
in
brief,
your
honor.
the
court
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
they
did
not
decide
it.
in
regard
to
timeliness,
your
honor,
the
employee
has
a
year
to
file,
and
ten
years
later,
in
1938,
congress
enacted
a
different
provision
that
said
time
is
not
going
to
run
against
the
employee
until
the
employer
also
files,
but
the
purpose
of
this
enactment
was
to
prevent
employer
overreaching,
which
is
certainly
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
also
provided
the
employee
his
one
remedy,
that
if
he
were
to
pursue
compensation
in
a
state
or
any
other
jurisdiction
and
not
get
it,
he
would
still
have
it
in
the
district
of
columbia.
for
either
reason,
this
court
--
that
is,
for
either
one
of
these
reasons,
this
case
should
be
dismissed
and
should
be
dismissed.
with
regard
to
the
federal
question,
if
there
were
no
constitution,
if
there
were
no
magnolia
case,
if
there
were
no
mccartin
case,
the
result
reached
below
would
still
be
correct
for
reasons
dating
back
to
roman
law
where
it
is
said
no
one
ought
twice
be
sued
for
the
same
cause
of
action,
plus
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
state
that
there
shall
be
at
end
to
litigation.
but
there
is
a
constitution,
and
article
4
says
that
full
faith
and
credit
shall
be
given
in
each
state
to
the
public
acts
and
records
and
judicial
proceedings
of
every
other
state.
in
the
act
of
congress
implementing,
it
says
that
such
proceedings
shall
have
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
in
every
court
within
the
united
states
as
they
have
by
law
and
by
usage
in
the
courts
of
such
states
from
which
they
are
taken.
in
effect,
this
is
a
litigant's
bill
of
rights.
it
brings
an
end
to
litigation.
we
have
this
court
in
magnolia
telling
us
the
clear
purpose
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
establishes
throughout
the
federal
system
a
salutory
principle
of
common
law.
a
litigation
once
pursued
to
a
judgment
shall
be
conclusive
for
the
rights
of
the
parties
and
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
it
is
involved,
your
honor,
because
we
have
in
this
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
--
we
have
the
constitution,
we
have
an
act
implementing
it,
and
that
is
the
act
of
congress
gives
the
effect
of
a
judgment
in
one
state
the
some
effect
in
every
other
state.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
so
the
rights
that
are
--
when
the
parties
have
their
rights
concluded,
the
cause
of
action
is
merged
in
the
first
state
and
it
is
merged
in
every
other
state.
we
have
this
court
saying
again
in
magnolia
that
a
workmen's
compensation
award
that
has
been
final
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
court.
from
the
above,
we
learn
that
no
state
has
the
power
to
legislate
beyond
its
borders.
no
state
can
bind
within
its
borders
and
unbind
outside
and
thus
no
state
can
give
or
intend
to
give
an
award
or
judgment
within
its
borders
one
effect
and
a
different
effect
outside.
the
state
does
not
have
any
power
to
do
so.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
when
am
i
going
to?
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
yes,
your
honor,
i
intend
to
and
let
me
get
to
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
i
am
familiar
with
both
cases,
your
honor.
one
more
principle
is
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution
is
what
gives
extra-territorial
effect,
by
giving
an
award
or
judgment
in
a
rendering
state
the
same
effect
in
every
other
state.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
what
effect
is
to
be
accorded
a
workmen's
compensation
award
in
virginia
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
we
are
shown
in
dillard
v.
virginia
industrial
commission,
a
1974
case
before
this
court,
what
effect
an
award
in
virginia
has.
it
concludes
the
rights
of
the
parties.
it
binds
the
parties
and
it
binds
the
courts
in
virginia.
virginia
accords
a
workmen's
compensation
award
the
same
status
as
that
of
a
judgment.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
to
mislead
you.
i
do
not
believe
he
could.
he
received
an
award
for
total
incapacity.
there
is
a
separate
paragraph
in
65.1-56,
paragraph
18,
which
describes
what
total
and
permanent
incapacity
is,
but
the
dollars
are
the
same.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
yes,
it
is
the
same
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
i
don't
know
why
one
would.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
yes.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
it
is
under
subparagraph
18,
your
honor
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
your
honor,
they
don't.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
get
into
a
discussion
of
mccartin,
what
is
good
about
its,
what
is
right
about
it,
what
is
constitutional,
but
i
would
say
that
although
we
don't
recommend,
i
can't
tell
you
to
go
into
looking
at
the
extraterritorial
effect
of
the
state
legislature
of
the
state
statute
where
it
has
no
power.
i
cannot
lead
you
that
way.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
pettus
review
--
pettus
v.
american
airlines
--
reviewed
magnolia
and
it
reviewed
mccartin.
it
reviewed
the
statute
and
the
fourth
circuit
interpreted
the
virginia
statute
to
be
exclusive.
this
court,
in
butner
v.
united
states
in
1979,
and
bishop
v.
wood,
said
it
gives
great
deference
to
the
fourth
circuit
in
interpreting
state
laws.
the
state
laws
in
those
two
cases
were
north
carolina.
the
two
judges
that
decided
the
pettus
case
are
not
only
virginia
lawyers
but
they
were
educated,
they
received
their
legal
education
in
virginia.
on
that
ground
alone,
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
upheld.
but
in
virginia,
by
law
and
by
usage,
virginia
treats
a
workmen's
compensation
award
exactly
the
same
as
it
does
a
judgment,
and
by
law
and
by
usage
in
virginia
a
judgment
is
res
judicata
unless
timely
appealed.
it
was
never
appealed.
if
virginia
wanted
to
make
an
award
something
less
than
a
judgment,
it
could
easily
do
so,
but
it
did
not.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
how
would
you
do
it?
your
honor,
you
have
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
there
is
nothing
to
be
appealed.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
there
are
no
facts
that
you
can
put
on
the
bones
to
make
an
appeal.
he
has
a
final
award,
he
has
got
his
judgment,
and
the
time
for
appeal
has
gone,
it
is
final.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
your
honor,
i
am
not
the
greatest
one
for
interpreting
statutes,
but
the
illinois
statute
says
--
it
replaces
common
law
and
statutory
law,
actions
against
the
employer.
in
texas,
it
says
this
is
your
sole
remedy.
in
virginia
it
says
common
law
or
otherwise,
so
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
--
is
the
word
"otherwise"
greater
than
"statutory"
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
illinois
says
common
law
or
statutory.
virginia
says
common
law
or
otherwise.
is
"otherwise"
greater
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
your
honor,
"otherwise"
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
i
am
not
interpreting
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
i
would
take
the
position
of
the
court
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
if
they
think
that
the
virginia
act
is
more
similar
to
the
texas
act,
fine,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
your
honor.
i
cannot
draw
the
line
for
you.
in
mccartin,
the
court
said
if
it
were
apparent
that
an
illinois
award
was
intended
to
be
final
and
conclusive
of
all
the
rights
of
the
employee
against
the
employer,
then
magnolia
would
control.
beyond
its
decisive
facts,
the
magnolia
court
looked
at
three
things.
it
looked
at
the
award,
its
nature
and
effect,
statutory
construction
and
legislative
intent,
and
cases
to
interpret
it.
what
are
the
decisive
facts
in
mccartin?
the
decisive
facts
show
that
there
are
two
simultaneous
proceedings
going
on,
one
in
illinois
and
one
in
wisconsin.
wisconsin
was
studied
while
awaiting
a
lump-sum
agreement
without
prejudice
to
be
approved
in
illinois.
what
did
illinois
do?
illinois
agreed
with
this
arrangement
through
one
of
its
commissioners,
mr.
granada,
who
had
apparent
authority
to
approve
the
express
intent
of
the
parties.
the
nature
of
the
award
was
that
it
was
expressly
without
prejudice
to
proceed
to
wisconsin.
the
effect
of
the
award
was
that
it
was
not
final,
it
was
expressly
not
final,
and
so
the
court
in
illinois
could
not
bind
the
parties.
i
should
note
that
an
agreement
of
this
type
comes
within
the
exception
of
res
judicata
from
the
restatement
of
judgments.
at
this
point,
had
the
mccartin
court
given
the
illinois
award
its
expressly
intended
effect,
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
but
the
court
went
further.
it
went
into
the
extraterritorial
legislative
intent,
it
found
no
cases
on
point,
which
is
not
surprising,
and
it
read
the
statute
as
non-exclusive
to
the
extent
that
the
mccartin
court
turned
its
opinion
on
the
state
legislature's
intent
not
to
bind
a
party
extraterritorially.
we
disagree.
no
state
policy
can
be
greater
than
that
of
the
constitution.
and
so
it
is
we
believe
a
strange
concept
that
would
permit
the
constitution
of
this
country
to
turn
on
a
state
legislature's
extraterritorial
intent.
such
intent
is
constitutionally
meaningless.
the
department
and
mr.
thomas
in
their
brief
and
in
their
reply
briefs
imply
or
wish
that
a
state
cannot
bind
a
workmen's
compensation
case.
there
would
be
no
finality
at
all.
or
alternatively,
workmen's
compensation
cases
should
be
taken
out
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
if
that
is
so,
then
the
same
arguments
can
be
made
for
any
other
common
law
judgment.
all
of
these
arguments
--
and
there
is
not
one
argument
before
the
court
--
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
it
has
the
same
effect
as
a
common
law
judgment.
mr.
kevin
jeffrey
baldwin
that's
right,
and
what
i
am
talking
about
is
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
tax
cases,
the
wrongful
death
cases,
the
gambling
cases,
bigamy,
child
support,
winds
v.
north
carolina,
a
long
line
of
hard
decisions.
and
magnolia
said
that
we
cannot
say
that
a
workmen's
compensation
award
would
not
stand
on
any
different
footing.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
every
argument,
every
social
policy
argument
that
you
have
heard
today
has
been
expressly
rejected
by
this
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
