justice
harry

blackmun
but
would
he
have
obtained
a
single
dime
more
than
he
had
already
obtained?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
precisely,
therefore
why
go
to
virginia?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
we
are
making
a
lot
of
fuss
over
nothing
here.
you
went
to
the
district
of
columbia
because
there
was
more
money
available.
he
had
wrung
virginia
dry
of
all
its
funds
under
the
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whether
it
is
total
or
whether
it
is
permanent.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
virginia
courts
would
hear
a
petition
for
a
permanent
disability
award.
it
may
not
give
him
any
more
money,
but
they
would
hear
the
case,
we
were
just
told.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
think
you
would
want
to
treat
it
that
way,
but
the
fact
is
he
was
given
a
temporary
permanent
disability
award
and
virginia
did
not
bar
his
seeking
a
permanent
disability
award.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
something
slipped
my
mind
here.
why
did
this
case
go
to
the
fourth
circuit
rather
than
the
district
of
columbia
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
you
are
saying
by
that
is
that
there
is
no
interest
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
that
is
really
implicated
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
of
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
that
ever
presented?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
it
passed
on?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
wasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
certainly
would
have
avoided
the
constitutional
question,
wouldn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe,
if
it
had
been
decided
one
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
was
it?
you
ought
to
know.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
don't
usually
raise
those
in
an
administrative
hearing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
about
the
claim
that
the
d.c.
law
didn't
apply
because
it
is
the
longshoremen's
act
and
the
longshoremen's
act
does
not
permit
awards
where
a
state
has
awarded?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
assume
that
an
issue
had
been
raised
that
no
longshoremen's
style
recovery
may
be
had
because
the
state
has
already
entered
an
award,
and
you
read
something
out
of
the
longshoremen's
act
to
that
effect.
suppose
the
court
of
appeals,
it
had
been
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
is
absolutely
right,
the
district
of
columbia
award
is
barred
because
virginia
has
made
an
award.
would
that
have
been
a
correct
ruling?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
that
have
been
a
correct
ruling
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
really
what
is
challenged
here
is
the
pettus
case
and
not
this
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
perhaps
we
should
have
taken.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
despite
the
language
that
justice
powell
mentioned
to
you,
you
just
answered
him
that
after
this
temporary
permanent
disability
award
in
virginia,
he
could
have
gone
back
and
got
a
permanent
disability
award.
that
is
what
you
just
said.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that
language
that
justice
powell
read
to
you
wouldn't
bar
his
again
proceeding
in
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
you
may
have
answered
this,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
are
not
particularly
eager
to
have
magnolia
overruled.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
you
can
live
with
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
was
this
question
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
they
didn't
decide
it?
