justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
answered,
“yes,
the
shirt
was
in
my
luggage”?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
would
have
been
the
instruction,
if
any,
about
that
answer,
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
there
was
a
bench
conference
about
whether
you
were
going
to
pursue
this
for
impeachment
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
--
was
the
question
--
the
question
--
was
the
question
ruled?
it
must
have
been
--
the
question
must
have
been
ruled
proper
cross-examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
argument
was
at
the
bench?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
if,
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
wasn't
a
proper
cross-examination
in
the
first
place,
surely
it
was
not
and
nothing
that
happened
thereafter
was
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
go
outside
the
scope
of
proper
cross-examination
and
ask
some
--
some
question
that
you
know
you
can
impeach
him
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
is
that
what
the
argument
was
at
bench
that
was
this
a
proper
question
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
no
object
--
ever
any
objection
that
as
to
whether
this
--
this
initial
question
was
proper,
namely,
did
you
have
a
--
did
you
have
a
--
a
shirt
like
this
in
your
bag?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
would
--
if
he
answered
yes
to
the
question,
did
you
have
that
--
would
that
be
inconsistent
with
anything
he
said
on
direct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
just
found
the
--
the
cocaine
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
find
--
tell
him
that
shirt
withholds
in
his
bag.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
as
even
though
it
weren't
flatly
inconsistent,
it's
very
relevant
to
his
direct
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
if
he's
answering,
“yes,
i
had
a
shirt
like
that
in
my
bag.”
was
inconsistent
with
something
he
had
said
on
direct.
then
you're
within
--
that
is
--
that
is
impeachment
itself.
that
is
--
that
is
either
if
you're
using
some
illegally
obtained
information.
it's
used
to
--
it's
used
to
contradict
something
said
on
direct
examination
consistently
with
our
cases,
our
cases
already
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
let
me
pursue
my
point
with
you
at
the
moment.
suppose
--
suppose
at
this
bench
conference,
the
--
the
objection
was
made
that
this
question
was
not
proper
cross-examination
and
the
judge
said
it
doesn't
have
to
be
within
the
scope.
and
he
said
you
may
ask
that
question.
and
if
he
says
yes,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
if
he
says
no,
then
you
may
fully
introduce
the
t-shirt.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
--
you'd
have
a
little
problem,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
were
manufacturing
a
--
a
--
you
were
manufacturing
an
opportunity
to
impeach.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
asking
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
you're
asking
the
question
from
--
i
suppose
if
you
say
--
if
--
if
you
just
asked
him
one
cross-examination,
“by
the
way,
five
years
ago,
did
you
have
a
--
did
you
have
a
t-shirt
in
your
bag?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
and
then
you
could
prove
he
did,
that
would
be
improper.
it
is
completely
irrelevant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
--
here
on
page
43,
in
this
--
of
the
appendix
at
this
bench
conference,
mr.
mccain,
i
take
it
that's
the
defendant's
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
“how
can
he
be
impeached,
your
honor,
it
--
if
it
was
not
covered
on
direct,
whether
or
not
he
had?”
the
court,
“it
does
not
have
to
be
covered
on
direct.”
if
he
denies
something
under
oath,
which
is
--
and
then
a
cutoff,
well,
without
even
deciding
that
it
was
covered
on
direct
or
it
was
proper
of
the
cross-examination.
this
question
was
permitted
to
be
asked
and
then
the
opposite
of
the
question
was
permitted
to
be
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
has
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
you
think
that
you
--
you
don't
think
your
--
in
your
--
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
--
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
do
you
think
the
government
just
on
rebuttal,
without
ever
having
gone
through
this
thing,
could
have
introduced
the
shirt
found
in
the
bag?
called
the
agent
and
said,
“we
found
this
in
his
bag”.
because
arguably,
you'd
say,
that
is
absolutely
contradictory
to
his
direct
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
the
--
if
he
had
been
asked
--
if
he
had
been
asked
which
he
was,
did
he
--
“did
you
have
the
shirt
in
your
bag?”
and
he
had
said,
“yes,”
then
i
suppose
the
government
wouldn't
argue.
that
quite
inconsistent
with
his
direct
testimony
or
at
least
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
tell
me
again
or
maybe
you
didn't
tell
me.
if
he
had
answered,
yes
to
that
question,
“yes,
it
was
in
my
bag.”
and
the
government
--
tell
me
why
the
government
is
entitled
to
use
that
information
against
him
that
that
answer
in
argument
to
the
jury
--
obviously
they
obtained
--
they
were
put
on
to
the
question
by
an
illegal
act
of
theirs.
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
--
yes,
but
the
question
was,
did
they
have
it
in
his
bag?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
he
answered
and
says,
“yes,
i
had
it.”
now,
tell
me
why
you're
--
you
are
entitled
affirmatively
to
use
that
answer
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
--
even
though
the
question
you
ask,
it
has
its
source
in
an
illegal
--
in
an
illegal
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you're
--
you're
not
--
you're
not
exactly
saying
and
that
using
this
answer
as
you
were
in
these
other
cases
you
referred
to.
in
the
other
cases,
you
say
the
man
should
not
be
permitted
to
--
to
lie
on
the
stand.
and
here,
he
lied
and
we're
just
going
to
impeach
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
your
--
if
you
ask
him
the
question
and
he
answers,
yes.
you
aren't
impeaching
him
at
all.
all
you're
saying
is
that
we
don't
have
a
piece
of
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
maybe
a
critical
piece
of
evidence
in
--
in
convicting
him,
not
--
not
just
to
show
that
he's
dishonest,
but
it's
a
critical
piece
of
evidence
that
goes
to
government's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
doesn't
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unlike
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
your
argument
is
--
so
your
argument
is
that
any
illegally
seized
evidence
that
the
government
has
should
be
able
--
you
should
be
able
to
--
you
should
be
able
to
introduce
in
rebuttal
in
order
to
counter
--
if
it
goes
to
prove
that
what
he
said
on
--
on
direct
examination
was
dishonest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
then
on
the
cross,
you're
--
you
--
you
are
entitled
to
say,
“by
the
way,
on
such
and
such
a
date,
did
you
have
this
gun
in
your
house?”
and
go
through
a
whole
list
of
things
that
you
illegally
seized
from
his
house.
and
if
he
says,
yes
to
every
one
of
them,
you're
--
you're
home
free
and
if
he
says
no,
you
could
reduce
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
even
if
that
question
arose
out
of
--
even
came
to
--
came
to
the
government's
mind
because
they
had
seized
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
you'd
take
the
position
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
question
that
they
asked
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
the
possession
of
this
t-shirt
was
--
was
--
however
or
otherwise,
it
might
be
proper
cross.
it
was
improper
here,
because
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
provided,
to
have
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
--
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
they
had
had
a
warrant
and
had
seized
the
shirt
properly,
and
then
on
cross-examination,
i'd
ask
him
this
question,
he
would
say
that
would
have
been
a
proper
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
proper
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
within
the
scope
of
direct
examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
the
first
time
where
the
statement
in
which
to
impeach
comes
out
first
on
cross-examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
on
cross
that
he
was
impeached
in
walder.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
was
repeated
on
cross
like
you
would
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
you
would
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see,
you
said
on
direct
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
and
so
and
he
repeats
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
they
would
--
they
would
say
that
--
they
would
say
that
--
that
the
t-shirt
being
in
the
bag
--
finding
a
t-shirt
in
the
bag,
a
t-shirt
like
this
is
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
on
--
on
direct.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
plain
inconsistent
--
just
introducing
it
tends
to
impeach
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
statements
on
his
direct
examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
--
as
i
suppose
they
had
gotten
it
by
a
warrant
and
they
just
hadn't
introduced
it
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
direct
side
of
their
case,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
they
can
introduce
it
in
rebuttal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
i
just
decided
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
it
was
in
the
--
you
--
you
thought
the
question
about
it
was
perfectly
--
the
--
the
question
whether
he
had
it,
you
thought
was
perfectly
good
cross-examination,
if
they
had
had
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
and
so
--
and
i
suppose
on
rebuttal,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
to
introduce
the
t-shirt.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
--
if
there'd
been
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
isn't
it
arguable
then
that
the
t-shirt
is
as
far
as
the
exclusionary
rule
is
concerned,
you
aren't
to
do
anymore
to
the
exclusionary
rule
by
permitting
the
t-shirt
to
be
introduced
to
--
on
rebuttal,
because
it's
inconsistent
with
his
direct
examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
somebody
had
asked
him
on
his
direct,
“did
you
have
a
t-shirt
in
your
bag?”
and
then
he
had
said,
“no”,
you
could
introduce
the
t-shirt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
i
suggest
you
should
--
you
could
introduce
your
t
--
introduce
the
t-shirt
because
it
is
sufficiently
inconsistent
with
his
direct
testimony
that
it
would
tend
to
disprove
his
direct
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
my
--
that
--
that
was
my
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
prosecuted
quite
a
few
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but,
mr.
frey,
if
they
had
answered
this
question
yes
and
you
--
and
you
could
--
and
you
--
you
would
say
it
would
be
substantive
evidence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
substantive
evidence.
and
it's
--
and
you
--
and
you
would
use
it
because
it's
arguably
inconsistent
with
his
direct
testimony
on
his
side
of
the
case.
and
so,
any
--
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
reason
for
the
--
for
the
exclusionary
rule
is
deterrence,
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
it
could
be
foreseen
that
almost
any
piece
albeit
by
evidence,
if
you
could
get
a
hold
of
it
is
--
is
very
likely
to
turn
up
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
defendant's
testimony
if
he
takes
the
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
which
event,
you
could
always
use
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
problem
is
as
long
as
the
exclusionary
rule
here
is
one
of
--
one
of
its
limits.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
and
--
and
you
keep
--
and
one
of
the
relevant
questions
to
that
is
--
is
whether
or
not
the
--
the
amount
of
deterrence
is
worth
the
candle.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
if
he
had
answered
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
i
know.
you're
saying
--
you're
--
you're
saying
on
the
chance
that
he
lie,
i'm
entitled
to
ask
this
question
based
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
--
based
on
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
--
if
he
tells
the
truth,
you're
entitled
to
use
it
as
substantive
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
source
of
your
question
is
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
any
prior
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
that
it
had
been
true.
it
might
not,
it
--
either
there
may
still
have
been
a
--
a
question
of
--
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
keep
saying
that
but
it
--
conceivably,
you
could
--
the
instruction
could
be
considered
as
only
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
