mr.
william
c.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
statement
of
facts
first,
because
i
think
there's
some
expansion
now,
that's
useful
to
put
the
issues
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
show
also
the
pernicious
influence
of
the
principle
for
which
the
government
is
arguing.
the
prosecution
was
based
exclusively
on
the
testimony
of
the
codefendant,
mcleroth.
mcleroth's
liability,
as
a
general
proposition,
can
be
gained
by
the
fact
that
he
testified
that
he
had
been
forced
into
this
by
the
respondent
because
he
was
penniless.
he
had
no
income
for
several
years
and
not
file
any
federal
income
tax
returns.
evidence
shows
that
he
had
run
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
through
one
bank
account
that
was
admitted
into
the
evidence
on
his
cross-examination.
it
showed
in
fact,
that
he
had
telephone
bills
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
that
was
developed
through
a
cross-examination
of
mcleroth,
plus
the
fact
that
he
had
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
that
is
correct.
likewise
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
not
as
to
the
scope
of
the
question.
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
based
upon
the
fourth
amendment
problem
that
this
cross-examination
has,
that
is
the
cross-exam
--
examination
of
the
respondent.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no
--
no,
your
honor.
no.
no,
i'm
simply
saying
that
--
that
harris
is
distinguishable
because
in
that
instance,
the
defendant
offered
the
testimony
on
his
direct
examination.
mr.
william
c.
lee
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
we
contend
is
raised
by
agnello.
we
think
agnello
is
virtually
on
all
force
with
this
case,
because
in
agnello,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
well
[laughs]
sir,
i
think
silverthorne
and
--
and
agnello
are
clearly
distinguishable.
what
the
government
has
consistently
referred
to
as
the
doctrine
of
agnello
that
improperly
seized
evidence
cannot
be
--
cannot
be
used
at
all
is
not
the
doctrine
of
agnello,
that's
the
doctrine
of
silverthorne.
agnello,
in
fact,
dealt
specifically
with
cross-examination,
a
denial
of
a
prior
event
and
then
the
use
of
that
on
rebuttal
to
try
to
impeach
agnello.
it's
on
all
force
with
this
case.
and
one
of
the
points
that
i
wish
to
leave
with
the
court
is
that
if
you're
going
to
sustain
the
government's
position
on
this
matter
of
the
propriety
of
using
this
improperly
seized
evidence
on
cross-examination,
you
must
overrule
agnello.
you
cannot
fit
the
government's
argument
into
agnello
as
they
argued
in
their
principal
brief.
they
--
they
make
the
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
--
and
holding
of
agnello
was
narrower
than
the
government
attributes
to
it.
whereas
they
say,
that
agnello
holds
that
improperly
seized
evidence
may
not
be
used
at
all.
i
think
it
clearly
holds
as
--
as
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
from
it.
in
his
direct
examination,
agnello
was
not
asked
and
did
not
testify
concerning
the
can
of
cocaine.
in
cross-examination
in
answer
to
a
question
permitted
over
his
objection,
he
said
he
had
never
seen
it.
he
did
not
nothing
to
waive
his
constitutional
protection
or
justify
cross-examination
in
respect
of
the
evidence
claimed
to
have
been
obtained
by
the
search.
so
we
think
agnello
is
confined
to
the
inadmissibility
of
improperly
seized
evidence
through
cross-examination.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think,
yes.
i
think
that
given
the
broad
latitude
that
would
normally
be
permitted
a
cross-examiner,
i
think
it's
--
it's
obviously
a
judgment
call,
but
i
think
that
one
could
argue
that
--
that
the
cross-examination
per
se,
may
have
been
proper
in
an
effort
to
impeach
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
--
the
defendant.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no.
i
mean
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
precisely,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
it
would've
been
proper,
but
for
this
defect.
do
--
do
i
make
myself
clear?
mr.
william
c.
lee
okay.
all
right.
mr.
william
c.
lee
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
lee
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
but,
your
honor,
the
testimony
to
which
you
refer
in
walder
was
elicited
on
his
direct
examination.
that's
the
distinction.
you
see
this
is
the
first
instance
in
which
the
government
has
sought
to
use
cross-examination,
that
is
to
say,
the
first
instance
which
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
it
has
sought
to
use
improperly
seized
evidence
on
cross-examination
to
impeach
a
defendant
or
to
rebut
his
testimony
in
some
particular.
walder,
harris,
hass,
are
all
cases
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
exactly.
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
that
was
--
that
was
what
i
intend
to
say.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes,
but
mr.
justice
white
assisted
me
to
point
out
that
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
the
statement
sought
to
be
impeached.
the
statement
sought
to
be
impeached
in
walder
was
given
by
the
defendant
in
his
direct
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
sure.
mr.
william
c.
lee
and
in
this
case,
the
statement
sought
to
be
impeached
was
first
elicited
on
cross-examination.
and
therefore,
it
is
clearly
distinguishable
on
the
facts
from
walder,
harris
and
hass.
and
falls,
we
believe,
within
the
four
corners
of
agnello
and
requires
this
court
to
overrule
agnello,
if
it's
going
to
grant
the
government
the
relief
that
they
seek.
the
--
just
to
continue
on
briefly
with
the
facts,
i
--
i
want
to
pursue
this
because
i
think
it
shows
the
significance
of
this
issue
in
a
given
fact
situation.
mcleroth
in
addition,
as
i've
pointed
out
to
having
been
shown
to
be
untruthful
on
the
matters
of
his
income,
was
shown
by
his
own
banker
who
was
called
to
put
his
bank
records
in
to
have
told
him
that
in
this
instance,
he
was
importing
cocaine
for
the
government.
a
government
agent
was
quickly
called
to
the
stand
to
deny
that
that
was
the
fact.
the
respondent,
havens,
who
testified
in
his
own
behalf,
was
never
shown
of
any
prior
involvement
in
criminal
activities.
he
was
shown
to
have
traveled
abroad
to
the
middle
east
on
the
same
kind
of
export-import
business
that
he
testified
he
was
on
in
peru.
his
partner
in
that
business
was
called
to
corroborate
that.
he
put
character
witnesses
into
evidence
and
that
did
not
elicit
any
response
from
the
government
to
show
anything
negative
about
him.
and
in
short,
it
was
the
t-shirt,
just
this
cutup
t-shirt
that
was
the
only
piece
of
corroborative
evidence
that
corroborated
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
well,
we
respectful
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
--
we
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
evidence
does
not
establish
that
he
did
and
--
and
let
me
pursue
that
point.
the
government
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
the
--
the
government
in
--
in
its
argument,
your
honor,
clearly
inferred
that
mcleroth's
testimony
was
that
this
shirt
manufacturing
process
took
place
in
connection
with
the
trip
upon
which
these
two
men
were
arrested.
that
is
not
true.
mcleroth's
testimony
is
that
the
shirt
manufacturing
process
took
place
earlier
in
september
in
fort
wayne,
indiana.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
and
my
point
is
that
with
this
one
piece
of
corroborative
evidence,
which
we
--
which
we
contend,
was
improperly
submitted.
this
jury
was
out
nine
hours
and
finally
convicted
the
respondent
in
a
case
which
contrary
to
the
government's
footnote
1,
can
most
charitably
be
described
as
a
very
skinny
case.
and
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
understand
that,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
this
piece
of
evidence
for
which
there
is
no
logical
connection,
why
would
the
respondent
have
transported
a
cutup
t-shirt
that
was
manufactured
weeks
earlier
from
fort
wayne,
indiana
to
peru
and
then
transported
it
back
to
miami
international
airport?
and
furthermore,
he
was
not
going
to
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
they
were
traveling
on
the
same
plane.
they
were
not
down
there
on
the
same
business
according
to
the
respondent's
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
lee
the
record
shows,
i
think
that
he
substantially
financed
them
himself
although
i
believe
in
one
instance
he
said
that
he
ran
out
of
money
while
they
were
there.
and
that
havens
helped
pay
his
hotel
bill
and,
or
some
other
expenses.
but
the
point
is
there
is
no
logic
to
the
government's
position
that
he
would
have
transported
a
t-shirt
remnant
from
fort
wayne,
indiana
to
peru
and
back
to
the
miami
international
airport,
where
it
would
have
been
in
his
luggage
when
he
was
arrested
on
october
2nd.
the
conflict
which
the
government
elicited
on
cross-examination
was
when
havens
was
asked,
“did
you
have
this
cutup
remnant
in
your
baggage
when
you
were
arrested
on
october
2nd?”
he
said,
“not
to
my
knowledge”.
then
he
went
on
to
explain
at
some
length
that
he
did
acknowledge
that
when
his
luggage
was
returned
to
him
the
next
day,
agent
martinez,
in
a
very
elaborate
process,
went
through
his
luggage
and
(inaudible)
discovered
the
t-shirt
and
gave
him
a
receipt
for
it.
martinez
testified
when
he
put
the
shirt
in,
that
in
fact,
he
went
through
the
luggage
on
october
2nd,
found
the
t-shirt,
disclosed
it
to
havens
and
talked
to
him.
martinez
never
denied
the
conversation
on
october
3
and
the
question
i
would
raise
just
as
a
practical
matter
since
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
of
--
of
credibility.
why
would
an
experienced
drug
agent
discover
a
t-shirt
which
was
patently
related
to,
according
to
the
government's
position,
the
courier
that
they
had
arrested
four
hours
earlier
and
not
take
it
into
their
custody
at
that
time?
why
would
they
leave
it
in
the
luggage
after
having
first
discussed
it
with
havens
allegedly
on
october
2nd
to
rediscuss
it
with
him
on
october
3rd,
and
give
him
the
receipt
for
at
that
time?
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
did
not
personally,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
presume
that
trial
counsel
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
the
--
the
--
i
think
that's
correct
because
they
had
the
t-shirt
in
evidence
and
in
the
jury
room
with
them.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
the
matter
of
the
two
sub-arguments.
first,
while
we've
--
i've
discussed
the
matter
of
the
alleged
perjury,
the
government,
of
course,
has
maintained
throughout
in
its
principal
brief
that
the
reason
that
agnello
needs
to
be
overruled
is
to
protect
the
trial
process
from
perjury
by
the
defendant
on
cross-examination.
and
they
stoutly
insist
throughout
their
principle
brief
that
that's
clearly
what
we
have
here.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
it's
not
perjury.
there's
a
conflict
between
whether
havens
admitted
that
he
first
became
aware
of
the
t-shirt
on
october
2nd
or
october
the
3rd.
mr.
william
c.
lee
but
the
question
then
becomes,
your
honor,
do
we
overrule
in
effect
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
his
fourth
amendment
right,
because
of
a
mere
conflict
that
you
want
to
impeach
him
on
vis-à-vis,
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
he's
committed
perjury.
in
other
words,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
it
needs
this
extraordinary
remedy
in
order
to
curtail
or
prevent
perjury.
and
that's
what
they
talk
about
in
their
principle
brief.
and
then
when
they
filed
their
reply
brief,
after
we
had
taken
the
task
to
some
extent,
they
say
“well,
maybe
it
was
just
a
matter
of
credibility
and
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
do
it
anyway.”
and
it's
our
position
that
that
simply
impeaching
someone
or
--
or
attacking
their
credibility
in
some
particular
maybe
appropriate,
but
it
doesn't
justify
doing
a
way
with
their
fourth
amendment
right.
pursuing
a
point
that
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
and
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
saw
this
very
clearly,
when
it
said
as
--
as
we
quote
in
our
brief,
“according
to
the
view
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
prosecutor,
the
defendant
could
be
asked
on
cross-examination
a
question
which
answered
affirmatively,
would
admit
the
incriminating
tendencies
of
illegal
evidence
and
answered
negatively,
would
allow
the
subsequent
introduction
of
the
illegal
evidence
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment.”
what
the
government
is
really
asking
this
court
to
do
by
overruling
agnello
is
to
do
away
with
the
fourth
amendment
right
of
any
defendant
who
would
like
to
testify
on
his
own
behalf.
because
if
any
prosecutor
or
deputy
prosecutor
or
united
states
attorney
isn't
clever
enough
to
devise
a
line
of
cross-examination,
which
would
bring
within
the
scope
of
the
direct
some
object
or
fact
which
is
in
fact
somehow
connected
with
the
event,
he's
going
to
get
it
in.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
lee
but
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
i
--
i
want
to
look
at
this
from
a
practical
standpoint
and
we
cite
an
authority
in
the
footnote
for
this
proposition.
a
defendant
who
goes
to
trial
before
a
jury
and
does
not
testify
in
his
own
behalf
has
in
my
experience
at
some
duration
as
a
prosecutor,
almost
no
prospect
of
acquittal.
it
is
absolutely
essential
for
a
criminal
defendant
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
in
a
criminal
jury
trial.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think
he
should,
but
for
the
fact
that
here,
we're
saying
that
there
is
some
evidence
that
he's
been
constitutionally
and
permissibly
obtained.
and
that
simply
that
should
not
be
used
--
we're
not
saying
that
the
cross-examination
process
should
be
impeded
anyway,
we're
simply
saying
that
evidence
which
has
been
unconstitutionally
seized,
should
not
be
used
in
that
process.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
well,
not
really
your
honor,
because
you
see
in
that
case
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
pardon
me?
mr.
william
c.
lee
all
right.
mr.
william
c.
lee
in
that
case,
the
defendant
offered
the
testimony
in
question
on
direct
examination.
he
was
in
fact,
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
on
direct
examination,
trying
to
build
a
defense
affirmatively
and
shield
himself
from
this
impermissibly
seized
evidence.
and
i
think
the
court
there
and
we
concede
in
our
brief.
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
mr.
william
c.
lee
he
didn't
say
that.
oh,
no.
he
didn't
say
that
at
all.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
important
to
analyze
carefully
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
the
only
thing
that
he
said
that
they're
relying
upon
on
direct
examination
is
that
--
and
mr.
frey
read
it,
“and
you
heard
mr.
mcleroth
testify
earlier
as
to
something
to
the
effect
that
this
material
was
taped
or
draped
around
his
body
and
so
on
you
heard
that
testimony?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“did
you
ever
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity
with
mr.
mcleroth
and
augusto
or
mr.
mcleroth
and
anyone
else
on
the
fourth
visit
to
lima,
peru?”
answer,
“i
did
not.”
we
contend
under
the
weeks
case
that
that
is
simply
a
general
denial
of
his
involvement
in
the
crime.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
you
would
get
to
the
point
where
you
will
rule
that
this
direct
testimony
which
i
consider
to
be
attenuated
to
use
a
word
that
was
used
in
our
earlier
argument
in
its
relationship
to
the
t-shirt,
i
submit
that
you're
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
cases
in
which
you're
going
to
be
asked
then
to
examine
the
specific
phrasing
and
context
of
attenuated
answers
like
this
to
try
to
tie
them
up
to
something
specific
like
a
t-shirt
or
a
gun
or
the
cocaine
capsule
in
agnello
or
whatever.
but
i
do
think
that
there's
a
--
a
distinction
between
walder
and
this
case
and
a
very
important
one,
because
in
walder,
the
defendant
on
his
own
initiative,
attempted
to
build
a
defense
and
shield
himself
from
the
improperly
seized
evidence.
and
the
court
there
said
he
couldn't
do
that.
here,
it's
the
government
that's
trying
to
get
into
the
evidence,
the
impermissibly
seized
evidence,
by
i
think
what
can
charitably
be
describe
as
an
attenuated
line
of
questioning.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no.
i
presume
he
would've
said
no
and
then
the
--
then
the
question
occurs
to
me
as
has
occurred,
i
believe
to
mr.
justice
white
and
others,
then
is
that
--
would
that
standing
alone
be
a
competent
basis
to
admit
the
t-shirt
and
apparently
government's
position
is
that
it
would
be.
so
that
if
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
sure.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
and
if
the
t-shirt
had
been
properly
available
to
be
admitted,
no
question
that
they
could
do
that.
but
here
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
there
might
be
some
technical.
it
would
depend,
of
course,
on
the
line
of
questioning
because
it
would
have
to
be,
you
know,
related
to
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
--
but
i
think
they
probably
could've
shown
that.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
your
--
i
think
you're
abolishing
the
exclusionary
rule
for
a
--
for
a
defendant
who
takes
the
witness
stand
because
by
hypothesis,
if
the
object
is
closely
enough
related
to
the
general
subject
matter
of
the
case
or
the
event,
that
--
that
they
want
to
bring
in,
then
a
line
of
cross-examination
can
be
devised
to
bring
it
in.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think
it
would
and
if
it
--
if
it
weren't
under
this
constitutional
burden,
i
think
it
could
be
admitted.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no,
no,
no.
i'm
--
i'm
admitting
that
it
was
--
i'm
sorry.
this
was
the
distinction
we
had
tried
to
derive
before.
i'm
admitting
that
it
would
be
admissible,
but
for
the
constitutional
defect.
mr.
william
c.
lee
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
see.
well,
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
--
the
real
issue
and
i
think
something
has
been
lost
in
the
case
and
i
--
it's
a
point
that
i
--
i'm
glad
that
you
reminded
me
of
is
that
the
--
the
impermissible
activity
here
really
is
the
line
of
questioning,
more
or
so
perhaps
than
the
admission
of
the
physical
evidence.
for
example,
in
agnello,
there,
they
were
--
they
did
not
offer
the
physical
evidence
because
i
presume
it
had
long
since
been
destroyed.
what
they
offered
in
agnello
was
the
agent
who
had
seized
the
prior
drug
and
the
laboratory
chemist
who
had
analyzed
it.
i
really
think
a
question
was
raised
earlier
that
perhaps
the
objection
should
have
been
more
vigorously
and
timely
made
when
the
line
of
questioning
was
brought
up.
but
i
think
if
you
read
the
transcript,
you'll
see
the
trial
counsel
there
was
confronted
with
a
typical
dilemma
and
that
is
that
as
soon
as
the
t-shirt
is
mentioned,
if
he
pops
up
in
front
of
the
jury
and
makes
an
objection,
immediately,
he's
highlighted
that
evidence.
and
the
jury
concludes
either
if
he's
successful
that
he's
kept
something
out
that
he
shouldn't
have
or
if
he's
unsuccessful,
he's
highlighted
it.
what
he
did
was
to
ask
to
approach
the
bench
as
soon
as
he
could
gracefully
do
so
and
he
did
raise
it
then
in
the
bench
conference.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
but
my
point
simply
is,
your
honor,
that
i
think
that
--
that
from
a
theoretical
standpoint,
it
was
the
line
of
questioning
that
was
really
impermissible
and
i
can
concede
that
perhaps
a
more
timely
objection
could
have
been
made,
but
obviously
if
you
read
the
record,
that's
what
happened.
he
did
get
up
to
the
bench
very
shortly
after
that
issue
was
raised
and
did
take
it
up
with
the
judge
at
that
time.
mr.
william
c.
lee
no.
he
did
not
in
response
to
the
initial
reference
to
it
in
the
cross-examination.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
do
and
i
think
that
in
this
case,
one
has
to
read
very
carefully
the
questions
and
answers
given
and
put
them
in
the
context
of
some
of
the
other
facts
that
i
pointed
out.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
think
if
you're
going
to
overrule
agnello
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
--
and
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
does
any
abstract
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
it
is
a
hazard
--
it
is
the
hazard
of
testifying.
it
is
a
hazard
of
testifying.
mr.
william
c.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
lee
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes,
just
if
i
--
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
very
briefly
to
conclude
having
taken
the
position
and
i
hope
supported
it
that
if
the
government
is
to
be
granted
its
relief,
it
will
require
the
reversal
for
the
overruling
of
agnello.
i'd
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
policy
considerations
which
have
been
touched
on
in
the
briefs
about
whether
or
not
the
abolition
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
these
situations
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
that
there
are
some
real
problems
in
that
as
i've
already
suggested.
first,
i
think
any
prosecutor
who
is
competent
to
be
in
the
courtroom
could
have,
in
this
case
or
in
many
other
cases
where
there
is
a
piece
of
evidence
that
has
been
improperly
seized
which
can
be
related
to
the
transaction
at
issue,
can
surely
develop
a
line
of
cross-examination
to
cause
the
admission
of
that
evidence.
if
that's
the
case,
and
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
it's
very
important
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
no.
except
that
in
this
instance,
it's
our
position,
it's
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
lee
not
--
not
where
--
as
i've
stated
earlier,
the
issue
was
first
raised
upon
the
cross-examination
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
c.
lee
it
--
it
maybe
but
i
think
it
happens
to
exist.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
william
c.
lee
perhaps.
mr.
william
c.
lee
alright.
the
second
point
that
i
wish
to
make
to
relate
to
that
is
that
because
of
the
interest
in
the
prosecution
in
keeping
defendants
off
the
stand
and
the
opportunity
to
use
improperly
suppressed
evidence
to
do
so,
there
would
be
an
incentive
in
fact
to
gather
evidence,
properly
or
improperly
seized
with
the
thought
that
as
long
as
we
have
it
in
the
file,
we
can
use
it
to
keep
the
defendant
from
the
witness
stand.
and
therefore,
it
will
serve
a
very
useful
purpose
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
--
well
--
mr.
william
c.
lee
we
have
--
we
have
cited
at
footnote
13
of
our
brief
an
authority
for
the
converse
of
that,
so
i'll
have
to
let
the
court
evaluate
that
point.
mr.
william
c.
lee
it
is
a
handbook
on
criminal
procedure
which
says
that
you
should
do
everything
you
want
to,
to
keep
the
defendant
off
the
witness
stand.
[laughs]
mr.
william
c.
lee
i
don't
think
i
can
present
it
any
further,
your
honor.
i
think
i'm
on
an
impasse
there.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes,
i
have.
and
today
i'm
here
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
william
c.
lee
with
all
due
respect,
i
wouldn't
think
that
a
policy
consideration
dealing
with
a
substantive
area
of
offense
would
be
a
competent
basis
for
doing
a
way
with
this
constitutional
protection.
thank
you.
