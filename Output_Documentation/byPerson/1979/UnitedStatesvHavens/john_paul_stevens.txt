justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask
one
question.
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
but
putting
to
one
side
for
the
moment
the
effect
that
the
evidence
was
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
whenever
a
--
a
defendant
makes
a
statement
on
cross-examination
that
the
prosecutor
believed
to
be
false,
the
prosecutor
has
a
right
to
impeach
that
statement.
it's
my
understanding
that
there
are
certain
collateral
areas.
there
are
some
that
has
developed
on
cross-examination
as
to
which
the
judge
in
his
discretion
may
say
even
if
it's
false,
i'm
not
going
to
allow
the
--
for
the
impeachment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
--
would
you
have
said
that
it
might
well
have
been
within
the
trial
judge's
discretion
in
this
case
to
say,
“well,
i
think
we've
gone
far
enough
with
this
matter
and
i
won't
allow
the
impeachment.”
i'm
not
suggesting
it
was
error
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
for
him
to
allow
it,
but
i'm
--
i
think
perhaps
the
converse
is
also
through
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
you
--
you
said
that
it
would
be
impeaching
of
his
direct
testimony
that
he'd
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
t-shirts,
but
that
was
cross-examination
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
thing
he
said
on
direct
was
that
he
said,
no
to,
“did
you
ever
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity
with
these
two
people?”
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
kind
of
activity
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
saying
he
had
the
t-shirt
in
his
bag
wouldn't
have
been
impeaching
of
that,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
if
he
simply
said,
“i'm
not
guilty.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
transaction.”
you
could
impeach
him
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
i'm
little
puzzled.
i
think
you're
changing
your
position
a
little
bit
and
maybe
you
tend
to
but
you
are
acknowledging
then
that
it's
admissible
under
harris
and
walder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
still,
i
--
i
think
you're
saying
then
it
is
--
it
is
impeaching
of
direct
testimony
putting
aside
the
fourth
amendment
argument.
if
you
admit
that,
then
i
would
think
it's
admissible
under
the
rationale
of
harris
and
walder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
it
was
for
use
by
prosecutors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
you
meant
--
