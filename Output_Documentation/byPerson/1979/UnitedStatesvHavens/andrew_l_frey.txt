mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
reversing
respondent's
convictions
for
possession
and
importation
of
cocaine
on
the
ground
that
respondent's
trial
testimony
was
improperly
impeached
by
the
use
of
illegally
seized
evidence.
on
october
2nd,
1977,
respondent's
coconspirator,
mcleroth,
a
fellow
attorney
from
fort
wayne,
indiana,
was
apprehended
by
customs
at
the
miami
airport
in
possession
of
approximately
three
and
a
half
pounds
of
cocaine,
which
was
hidden
in
pockets
sewn
into
a
t-shirt.
upon
being
questioned,
mcleroth
implicated
respondent
who
had
arrived
in
miami
with
him
on
the
same
flight
from
peru
and
had
already
cleared
customs.
respondent
was
located
by
the
agents
and
arrested
and
his
luggage
was
seized
and
searched.
it
contained
a
t-shirt
from
which
material
was
missing
that
correspondent
to
the
material
used
in
making
the
pockets
in
mcleroth's
shirt,
in
which
the
cocaine
was
secreted.
on
respondent's
pre
--
pretrial
motion,
the
district
court
suppressed
the
t-shirt
as
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
warrantless
search
of
respondent's
luggage.
now,
mcleroth
testified
as
the
principal
prosecution
witness
at
trial.
he
recounted
several
trips
that
he
and
respondent
had
made
to
peru
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
cocaine
and
he
described
respondent's
role
in
preparing
the
pocketed
t-shirt
for
use
in
the
smuggling
venture.
with
regard
to
the
ill-fated
trip
that
culminated
in
their
arrest,
he
described
respondent's
actions
in
procuring
the
cocaine
in
peru
and
secreting
it
in
the
shirt.
respondent
testified
in
his
own
defense
and
he
denied
any
involvement
in
the
cocaine
smuggling.
in
the
course
of
his
direct
testimony,
the
following
colloquy
occurred
which
appears
at
page
34
of
the
appendix.
question,
“and
you
heard
mr.
mcleroth
testify
earlier
as
to
something
to
the
effect
that
this
material
was
taped
or
draped
around
his
body
and
so
on,
you
heard
that
testimony?”
“yes,
i
did.”
question,
“did
you
ever
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity
with
mr.
mcleroth
and
augusto
or
mr.
mcleroth
and
anyone
else
on
that
fourth
visit
to
lima,
peru?”
“i
did
not.”
on
cross-examination,
the
prosecutor
asked
the
following
question
which
appears
on
page
35
of
the
appendix.
“now,
on
direct
examination,
sir,
you
testified
that
on
the
fourth
trip,
you
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
wrapping
of
any
bandages
or
t-shirts
or
anything
involving
mr.
mcleroth,
is
that
correct?”
answer,
“i
don't.
i
said
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
wrapping
or
bandages
or
anything
else.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
anything
with
mr.
mcleroth
in
connection
with
this
cocaine
matter.”
and
further
down,
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
was
asked,
“your
testimony
is
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sewing
of
the
cotton
swatches
to
make
the
pockets
of
that
tee
shirt?”
answer,
“absolutely
not.”
and
when
it
became
clear
that
the
prosecutor
intended
to
pursue
the
subject
of
the
shirt
found
in
respondent's
luggage,
a
bench
conference
was
held.
the
court
concluded
that
it
would
permit
questioning
about
the
shirt
for
impeachment
purposes.
if
respondent
admitted
that
the
shirt
was
in
his
luggage
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
if
he
denied
it,
impeachment
of
his
denial
would
be
permitted.
respondent
did
in
fact
deny
any
knowledge
that
the
shirt
had
been
in
his
luggage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
have
been
--
it
--
i
think
he
could
have
been
asked
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
how
do
you
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
instruction
about
that
answer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
bench
conference
about
this
whether
this
questioning
would
be
allowed
as
cross-examination
and
whether
if
he
answered
in
response
to
the
cross-examination
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
definitely
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
argument
at
the
bench
was
about
whether
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
the
government
could
cross-examine
on
this
subject.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
cross-examination
was
proper.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
--
that
--
that's
correct.
it's
not
our
contention
that
you
could
ask
something
that's
outside
the
proper
scope
of
direct,
but
when
you're
dealing
with
a
testifying
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i
think
the
argument
involved
the
--
the
walder-harris
issue
about
whether
they
would
--
it
would
be
permissible
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
specifically
recollect
whether
that
point
was
made.
the
--
the
thrust
of
the
discussion
was
that
the
prosecution
had
a
right
to
ask
the
question
if
the
question
was
answered
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
illegally
seized
evidence,
impeachment
of
that
answer
by
rebuttal
testimony
would
be
allowed
and
by
introduction
of
the
shirt.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
answered,
yes,
it
--
yes,
it
would
be
inconsistent.
he
would
have
to
--
he
would
have
some
explaining
to
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
--
both
with
his
testimony
that
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
cocaine
smuggling.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
peculiar
that
he
has
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
shirt
withholds
as
the
shirt
that
--
that
evidently
was
used
in
the
preparation
of
the
--
of
the
shirt
that
mcleroth
wore.
it
is
certainly
a
--
a
strongly
suspicious
circumstance
that
if
he
had
no
involvement
whatsoever,
if
he
didn't
know
as
he
testified
that
mcleroth
was
obtaining
cocaine
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
--
it
is
--
yes
it's
--
it's
our
contention
that
this
is
unquestionably
proper
cross-examination
except
for
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
illegally
seized.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
--
how
much
the
net
of
agnello
picks
up
today
i'm
not
sure,
but
agnello
itself
is
--
is
somewhat
unclear
as
to
exactly
what
the
four
ramifications
of
its
rationale
are.
our
view
of
agnello
is
that
--
that
its
principal
rationale
was
that
you
simply
cannot
use
illegally
seized
evidence
in
court
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
i
don't
think
that
was
the
focus
of
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
clearly,
the
purpose
of
the
cross-examination
in
this
case
was
to
try
to
give
the
light
of
his
testimony
that
he
had
no
involvement
in
the
cocaine
smuggling
and
he
had
no
involvement
in
preparing
mcleroth's
shirt
and
so
on,
on
the
last
trip
by
--
by
calling
him
to
account
for
evidence
that
exist,
that
the
tendency
of
which
is
inconsistent
with
his
testimony.
but,
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
normal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
wish
it
were
that
easy,
but
i'm
afraid
it
wouldn't
be
perfectly
consistent
with
agnello,
because
in
agnello,
the
evidence
was
initially
suppressed.
he
then
took
the
stand
and
testified
and
the
evidence
was
introduced
to
impeach
his
answers
on
cross-examination.
in
that
respect,
agnello
was
structured
in
a
manner
parallel
to
the
present
case.so
that
--
while
i
think
the
court,
as
--
as
i
will
get
to
as
--
as
it
has
matured
in
its
thinking
on
this
problem
and
in
--
in
the
more
contemporary
cases,
the
court
has
clearly
come
to
the
view
that
the
distinction
that
you
suggest
is
the
proper
one.
the
court
said
in
harris
unequivocally
and
it
said
it
again
in
--
in
oregon
against
hass
unequivocally,
that
the
deterrent
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
are
adequately
served
by
excluding
the
evidence
from
the
prosecution's
case
in
chief,
making
it
put
on
a
case
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
without
any
reliance
upon
the
illegally
obtained
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i
think
that
we
--
well,
we
have
two
arguments
in
this
case.
the
--
the
first
argument
is
which
is
on
the
broad
issue,
is
that
the
distinction
of
the
court
of
appeals
attempt
to
draw
between
impeachment
of
answers
given
on
direct
examination
and
impeachment
of
answers
given
on
cross-examination
is
not
a
valid
distinction.
the
way
we
would
look
at
the
case
is
to
ask
the
question
whether
cross-examination
on
this
point
was
proper.
if
cross-examination
on
the
point
was
proper,
it
is
our
view
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
conduct
that
cross-examination
and
the
defendant
is
obliged
to
submit
to
it
and
that
that
is
well
settled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
if
he
then
lies
in
response
to
the
cross-examination,
then
the
government
is
entitled
to
impeach.
now,
as
i
said
before
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there's
absolutely
no
question
in
this
case
that
if
this
t-shirt
had
been
found
in
a
warranted
search
or
had
been
found
at
the
time
havens
was
going
through
customs
and
therefore,
there
was
no
question
of
the
legality
of
the
seizure,
nobody
would
question
for
a
moment
that
the
t-shirt
could
be
used
in
exactly
in
the
manner
it
was
used
in
this
case
and
his
answers
could
be
impeached.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
could
have
been
used
in
the
case
of
chief,
but
if
the
prosecutions
for
some
reason
had
not
used
it
on
the
case
in
chief,
it
could
have
been
used
in
connection
with
the
cross-examination
and
for
impeachment
or
rebuttal
of
the
responses
given
on
cross-examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
i
understand
that
they
are
two
conceptually
different
things.
there
are
times
when
impeachment
and
rebuttal
tend
to
merge
in
the
--
in
the
tendency
of
the
particular
evidence.
i
mean
the
case
like
walder,
is
a
--
is
a
case
where
clearly
only
impeachment
was
involved
and
not
rebuttal,
because
the
evidence
was
evidence
of
a
prior
crime
which
was
inconsistent
with
his
denial
that
he
had
ever
had
drugs
before.
not
admissible
at
all
on
the
--
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
in
that
case,
but
admissible
only
on
the
question
of
the
defendant's
veracity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
that
--
i
guess
my
--
my
view
is
that
it
reaches
--
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
--
in
which
there
--
the
distinction
is
--
while
it
exists
is
more
technical
and
substantial
in
terms
of
the
use,
because
in
--
in
a
case
where
the
evidence,
be
it
impeachment
or
rebuttal,
relates
directly
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
and
not
to
any
collateral
question.
in
order
for
the
jury
to
conclude
that
the
defendant's
testimony
has
been
impeached,
that
is
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
they
will
presumably,
by
virtue
of
that
very
conclusion,
determine
that
the
opposite
of
what
he
was
saying
was
the
truth
or
was
likely
to
be
the
truth.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
rebuttal,
but
--
but
where
the
witness
is
called
to
contradict
a
specific
statement
that
the
defendant
made
in
his
direct
or
cross-examination,
is
where
the
distinction
begins
to
pale,
i
think.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
my
--
my
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
problem.
they
wouldn't
be
--
involve
the
issue
that's
presented
in
this
case.
the
--
our
problem
in
that
case
would
not
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
shirt
had
been
illegally
seized,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
court
had
allowed
improper
cross-examination
that
before
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
matter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
--
what
the
rule
would
be
if
--
if
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that's
--.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i
think
--
well,
what
is
submerged
in
that
is
that
the
--
the
defendant's
attorney
was
suggesting
that
he
never
talked
about
the
t-shirt
that
was
found
in
his
bag,
which
of
course
he
wouldn't
since
his
tendency
was
purely
inculpatory
and
it
wouldn't
help
him
to
talk
about
it
at
all.
what
the
court,
i
think
was
saying
is,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
covered
with
that
degree
of
specificity
on
direct
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
in
order
to
justify
cross-examination.
and
if
he
gives
a
false
answer
on
cross-examination
--
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
if
he
says,
“yes,
that
shirt
was
in
my
bag
and
it
had
pieces
missing.”
that
--
that
would
--
there
wouldn't
be
no
testimony
about
the
discovery
of
the
shirt,
no
actual
introduction
of
the
shirt.
but
as
i
see
the
scenario
and
i
--
it
seems
clear
to
me,
the
question
you
ask
is,
“is
this
proper
cross-examination?”
and
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
leaving
aside
the
illegal
nature
of
the
seizure
of
the
shirt,
there
would
be
any
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
the
cross-examination.
if
he
answers
falsely
in
response
to
a
question
asked
on
proper
cross-examination,
that
answer
can
be
impeached
by
contradictory
testimony.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
i
--
my
position
is
the
court
does
not
have
to
go
that
far
to
decide
this
case,
but
i
think
if
it
had
such
a
case,
the
government
should
be
permitted
to
do
that.
and
indeed
i
think
that,
that
is
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
impeach
that.
what
would
happen
then
is
that
that
his
answer
might
be
further
explored.
i
mean
--
then
the
next
question
would
be,
“well,
how
--
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
have
in
your
bag
a
shirt
that
was
used
in
connection
with
the
cocaine
smuggling?”
and
then
he
would
give
some
explanation
or
no
explanation
and
then
that
matter
would
be
probe,
but
it
would
never
be
necessary
to
introduce
the
shirt
separately
from
his
own
testimony.
and
he
must
give
that
testimony
on
cross-examination
because
he
chose
to
get
up
on
direct
examination
to
deny
his
guilt,
to
deny
his
involvement
with
the
smuggling,
to
deny
his
involvement
with
the
preparation
of
the
shirt.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
a
case
like
this,
i
--
i
think
it
is
clear
that
if
he
chose
to
get
on
the
stand
and
testify
and
deny
any
involvement
in
the
cocaine,
he
--
he
would
and
did
properly
loose
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
his
right
to
testify,
i
think
--
it
is
clear
that
his
right
to
testify
is
not
a
right
to
get
on
the
stand
and
give
false
testimony
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
said
precisely
that
in
harris,
you
said
precisely
that
in
nobles
with
--
where
the
question
was
whether
the
investigator's
testimony
to
the
court,
as
you
--
you
--
in
the
plural
sense,
where
the
question
was
whether
they
had
to
turn
over
the
investigator's
notes
and
the
court
said
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
confer
the
right
to
present
testimony
free
from
the
legitimate
demands
of
the
adversarial
system.
one
cannot
invoke
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
justification
presenting
what
might
have
been
a
half
truth.
and
then
united
states
against
grayson,
where
the
defendant
claimed
that
his
right
to
get
on
the
stand
would
be
inhibited
by
the
possible
effect
on
his
sentence
of
the
judge's
conclusion
that
he
had
lied.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
said
assuming
arguendo
that
the
sentence
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
correct,
but
he
does
not
have
a
right.
he
does
not
have
a
right
in
our
view
and
i
think
the
court's
cases
make
that
clear
to
get
on
the
stand
and
present
a
false
defense.
if
he
does
that,
then
he
has
forfeited
the
benefits
of
--
of
suppression.
in
so
doing,
because
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
has
been
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
what
his
rights
were,
but
they
didn't
include
smuggling
cocaine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly,
that
would
both
be
impeachment
and
rebuttal
and
although
whether
or
not
it
would
be
rebuttal,
would
depend
on
whether
the
evidence
went
to
guilt
or
innocence
in
the
case
or
to
a
collateral
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
it
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
then
it
would
be
impeached.
in
that
context,
it
would
be
impeachment
and
there's
no
question
that
this
could
be
done.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
--
not
in
our
view
and
certainly
it
involves
no
more
smuggling
in
this
--
this
suggestion
that
something
insidious
is
being
done
by
the
prosecutor.
it's
no
more
smuggling
into
cross-examine
about
the
t-shirt
in
view
of
its
high
relevance
to
the
defendant's
testimony
than
it
would
be
in
the
stewardess
example.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
and
in
this
case,
and
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
why
the
position
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
--
that
is
why
the
position
for
which
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
are
--
they
are
not
the
same
in
that
respect
and
that
is
why
the
position
for
which
we're
contending
does
not
do
damage
to
the
objectives
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
because
the
prosecution
still
must
make
its
case
against
respondent
without
using
the
illegally
seized
evidence.
only
if
it
can
get
to
the
jury
does
this
quest
--
with
--
without
the
illegally
seized
evidence,
does
this
question
even
arise.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
but
--
but
it
would
have
to
be
collateral.
on
this
case
it's
not
collateral,
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
if
the
testimony
goes
directly
to
--
to
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
--
my
view
is
that
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
error
for
him
not
to
--
to
permit
the
impeachment.
i
think
there
--
there
is
an
area
of
cross-examination
which
goes
to
the
issue
that
must
be
decided
by
the
jury.
and
within
that
area,
the
judge
does
not
have
discretion
to
cut
off
cross-examination
or
impeachment.
then
there
are
areas
that
are
collateral
to
the
basic
inquiry
and
in
those
areas,
i
believe,
the
judge
does
have
discretion
to
let
it
in
or
let
it
out.
this
however,
i
think,
was
central
because
(voice
overlap)
the
sheriff
was
evident
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
not
solely
in
this
case
since
they
also
had
the
testimony
of
mcleroth
about
the
t-shirt
and
about
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
understand
that
that
if
they
had
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
we're
entitled
to
cross-examine
him
when
he
takes
the
stand
and
the
policies
of
the
exclusionary
rule
are
not
sufficiently
advanced
by
restricting
the
traditional
and
essential
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
sir.
because
that
is
--
that
was
true
in
harris
and
that
was
true
in
hass,
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
then
impeached.
asked
on
cross-examination,
had
their
source
in
an
illegal
search.
it's
true
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
that
the
defendant
adverted
to
the
matter
in
his
direct
testimony,
but
they
never
would've
been
able
to
ask
him
about
the
statements
if
they
hadn't
procured
the
statements.
so
i
don't
think
this
case
is
different
in
that
regard.
the
court
would
have
to
go
back
and
reconsider
harris
and
hass
in
order
to
rest
the
decision
on
the
--
on
the
impropriety
of
the
question
itself.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
i
understand
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
happens
to
show
--
it
happens
to
show
both
at
the
same
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
why
does
it
show
that
he's
dishonest?
it
doesn't
show
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
he's
dishonest
when
--
when
answering
our
last
question,
but
it
shows
that
he
was
--
it
shows
that
he
was
dishonest
in
answering
the
questions
on
direct
examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
like
he
had
no
involvement
in
the
cocaine
smuggling.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
mcleroth
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
preparing
the
shirt.
those
answers
are
inconsistent
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
for
rebuttal
or
impeachment.
i
mean
we're
back
in
that
--
our
--
our
narrow
position
in
this
case,
although
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
i
suppose
that's
right,
assuming
that
they
are
within
this
realm
of
cross-examination
that
we're
entitled
to
conduct.
i
--
i
mean,
i
think
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
existence
of
--
of
--
for
instance,
a
defendant
can
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
resist
cross-examination.
once
he
elects
to
take
the
stand,
there
are
consequences
that
flow
from
that
and
i
think
the
court
has
been
steadfast
in
its
adherence
to
the
policy
that
the
truthfulness
of
his
testimony
can
be
explored
and
cross-examination
is
the
primary
instrument.
impeachment
is
secondary
when
cross-examination
fails.
and
--
and
our
position
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
of
course
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
--
first
of
all,
it
impeaches
his
denial
of
any
involvement
with
the
cocaine.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
mcleroth,
he
testified.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
importing
the
cocaine.
now,
if
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
those
things,
what
was
this
t-shirt
doing
in
his
luggage?
it
certainly
demanded
an
explanation.
now,
it
--
it's
also
our
view,
as
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
that
his
testimony
about
draping
and
taping
the
material
on
the
fourth
trip,
he
was
a
lawyer,
i
think
it's
clear
that
he
was
trying
to
tailor
his
testimony
to
waltz
between
the
walder,
agnello,
harris
line.
but
in
our
view,
when
we
analyze
it
in
our
brief,
that
testimony
amounted
to
the
jury.
it
communicated
a
denial
of
any
involvement
in
preparing
the
shirt
in
which
the
cocaine
was
secreted
and
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
under
our
first
position,
that's
right,
if
it's
a
legitimate
cross-examination.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
wanted
to
be
clear
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
white
asked
earlier
about
whether
the
interrogation
itself
is
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
seizure
that
that
was
true
in
walder,
that
was
true
in
harris,
that
was
true
in
hass.
and
therefore,
in
order
to
base
a
decision
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
on
that
ground,
you
would
have
to
retrace
steps
that
you've
already
taken
in
those
cases.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
here
is
basically
the
straightforward
exclusionary
rule
policy
case
with
which
the
court
has
often
been
confronted,
balancing
the
values
of
accurate
trial
outcomes
and
particularly,
the
value
of
--
of
exposing
false
testimony
on
the
one
hand
against
the
deterrent
values
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i
think
that
the
balance
has
basically
already
been
struck
in
harris
and
in
hass.
the
court
made
clear
there.
it
stated
explicitly
that
keeping
the
evidence
out
of
the
prosecution's
case
in
chief
is
sufficient
deterrent.
we're
now
in
the
area
of
speculation
which
respondent
engages
in
about
whether
the
distinction
between
impeach
and
cross-examination
answers
an
impeaching
direct
examination
testimony,
and
as
we've
seen
earlier
in
the
argument
of
this
case,
that
can
be
a
very
fuzzy
distinction,
will
materially
alter
the
behavior
of
police
officers
and
secure
a
greater
degree
of
compliance
with
the
dictates
of
the
fourth
amendment.
essentially,
the
argument
that
the
prosecution
will
arm
itself
with
means
of
keeping
the
defendant
off
the
stand
was
an
argument
that
was
equally
applicable
in
harris
and
in
hass.
and
indeed,
in
hass,
that
was
the
very
argument
that
was
made
that
the
prosecution
--
that
the
police
there
having
given
miranda
warnings
and
the
defendant
having
asked
for
a
lawyer,
they
could
do
nothing
to
get
a
statement
that
would
be
admissible
on
the
miranda
at
that
point,
therefore,
they
had
every
incentive
to
go
ahead
and
collect
this
evidence
for
possible
use
for
impeachment
purposes
and
the
court
refused
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
in
the
same
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
that
it's
both
substantive
and
impeaching.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
can
be
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
can
be
foreseen
in
many
circumstances.
i
mean
many
of
the
exceptions
for
the
exclusionary
rule
take
the
standing
or
requirement,
for
instance,
if
i
can
use
that
word
to
describe
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
the
question
that
we
have
before
the
court.
and
our
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
the
--
the
basis
of
the
court's
continued
adherence
to
the
exclusionary
rule
is
that
the
fundamental
deterrence
of
keeping
the
evidence
out
of
the
prosecution's
case
in
chief
is
still
judged
sufficiently
worth
a
candle
to
retain
the
rule.
the
question
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
given
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
our
--
but
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
cross-examine
him
and
we're
entitled
to
have
truthful
answers
from
him.
and
of
course,
the
answers
he
gives
on
cross-examination
are
as
much
substantive
evidence
as
the
answers
he
gives
from
direct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
saying
that
we
are
entitled
to
ask
the
question
in
the
hope
that
he'll
tell
the
truth.
if
he
does
not
tell
the
truth,
then
we're
entitled
to
impeach
his
false
answer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct,
and
that
was
--
that
was
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
--
oh,
yes,
that
would've
been
true
in
walder
as
well
if
he
had
--
if
on
cross-examination
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
but
supposed
in
harris
on
cross-examination,
they
had
said,
“didn't
you
make
the
statements?”
and
he'd
--
and
he'd
said,
“yes,
they
--
they
are
true,
my
testimony
on
direct
examination
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
was
wrong.
i
have
now
corrected
in
this
manner.
that
would
be
used
as
direct
evidence.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i
do.
i
don't
want
to
recede
in
any
way
from
my
argument
that
this
is
also
impeaching
his
--
his
answers
on
direct
--
his
denials
on
direct
of
his
complicity
in
the
crime.
if
you
had
a
bank
robber
and
you
found
scheme
masks
and
the
loot
in
his
apartment
in
an
illegal
search,
and
he
got
on
the
stand
and
said,
“i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
bank
robbery,
nothing
whatsoever,”
the
scheme
masks
and
the
loot
would
clearly
impeach
that
denial
of
guilt
as
well
as
contradicted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
just
pleads
not
guilty,
you
clearly
could
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
it's
not
the
denial
of
guilt
in
that
form
that
is
the
focus
of
the
court's
attention.
the
--
first
of
all,
you
have
the
policy
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
inconsistent
to
some
degree
with
the
truth
seeking
function,
but
which
--
which
hasn't
been
limited
before
to
the
--
to
the
direct
case
of
the
prosecution.
the
prosecution
can't
use
it.
now,
the
question
is,
“what
uses
can
it
make
for
impeachment
or
rebuttal?”
and
all
the
--
the
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
since
agnello
have
all
allowed
an
impeachment
or
rebuttal
use
of
the
evidence.
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
what
deterrence
you
feel
will
be
accomplished
and
it's
a
matter
of
the
policy
that
he's
entitled
to
plead
not
guilty
even
if
he's
guilty
of
sin.
but
he's
not
entitled
in
this
court's
view
to
get
on
the
stand
and
testify
falsely,
and
that
policy
comes
into
play
once
it
does
so.
thank
you.
