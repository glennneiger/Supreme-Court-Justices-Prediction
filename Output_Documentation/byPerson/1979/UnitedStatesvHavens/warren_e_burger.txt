chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
lee
havens.
mr.
frey,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
your
position,
mr.
frey
that
anything
within
the
area
of
--
of
the
case
itself,
which
tends
to
reflect
negatively
on
the
credibility
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
on
the
stand
is
admissible.
how
--
how
far
do
you
carry
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
have
they
use
it
in
the
case
in
chief
and
that
--
and
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
we
say
precisely
that
in
harris?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
assume
a
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
he
--
as
--
as
here,
he
was
trying
in
his
testimony
to
dissociate
himself
from
mcleroth
completely.
suppose
his
testimony
had
gone
so
far
to
say
that
--
that
he
had
never
seen
mcleroth
in
his
life,
didn't
know
him
and
never
had
a
conversation
with
him.
and
then
they
brought
the
stewardess
of
the
airline
and
--
and
he
insisted
on
that
on
his
--
on
his
cross-examination.
could
he
be
impeached
by
bringing
in
the
stewardess
of
the
airline
who
said
they
sat
together
and
were
engaged
in
emanated
conversations
throughout
the
entire
flight
from
peru
to
miami?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
this
doesn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
hypothetical
doesn't
go
to
guilt
or
innocence
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
goes
to
whether
this
fellow
--
it
would
be
a
reliable
witness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
--
is
--
is
this
t-shirt
fundamentally
in
terms
of
the
law
of
evidence
different
from
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
testimony
of
the
stewardess
on
the
airline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
--
how
did
this
develop,
by
impeachment
of
mcleroth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
--
no
--
no
one
questions
that
that's
perfectly
valid
cross-examination
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
between
cross-examining
a
--
a
witness
in
chief,
to
undermine
credibility
and
to
do
the
same
thing
to
a
defendant
who
takes
the
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you're
--
you're
questioning
harris
against
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
think
your
responses
in
conflict
with
what
the
court
did
in
walder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
cross-examination
in
walder
was
that
he
had
never
--
he
was
asked
--
walder
was
asked,
“have
you
ever
sold
narcotics?”
and
he
said,
no,
he
hadn't.
and
then
the
government
introduced
narcotics
which
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
had
been
suppressed
in
another
totally
independent
transaction
years
before.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn't
cross-examine
in
walder
by
the
prosecutor,
when
he
said
he
had
never
engaged
and
never
had
in
his
possession
any
narcotics.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
a
credibility
attack
whether
there's
outright
perjury
or
whether
there
is
faulty
recollection.
you
--
you
can
undermine
the
credibility
of
a
witness
by
showing
much
less
than
perjury,
can't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you're
quarreling
with
walder
and
harris
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
--
let
me
remind
you
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said.
“it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
government
cannot
make
an
affirmative
use
of
evidence
unlawfully
obtained.
it
is
quite
another
to
say
that
the
defendant
can
turn
the
illegalness
and
by
which
the
evidence
in
the
government's
possession
was
obtained
to
his
own
advantage
and
provide
himself
with
a
shield
against
contradiction
of
his
untruths.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
--
you're
really
arguing
with
that
proposition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
tell
me
how
that's
--
how
--
how
you
are
not
arguing
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
how
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
do
not
argue
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
havens
was
doing
when
he
said
he
didn't
know
mcleroth
and
never
had
anything
to
do
with
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
did
he
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
of
the
english
judges
is
often
quoted
in
american
opinions,
mr.
lee.
he
said
something
to
the
effect
that
cross-examination
is
the
greatest
tool
ever
invented
to
--
for
the
exposure
of
falsehood.
i
take
it,
you
generally
agree
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
necessarily,
that
makes
cross-examination
a
pretty
rough
business.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
interfere
with
the
--
does
--
does
the
allowance
of
cross-examination
interfere
with
the
right
to
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
abstract.
no.
just
in
the
abstract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
--
it's
a
hazard
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
take
the
stand
in
a
criminal
case
for
a
defendant
is
hazardous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
resume
at
1
o'clock
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
different
--
is
that
fundamentally
different
from
many
tactical
choices
and
options
that
are
available
in
the
trial
of
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
that
was
argued
in
walder
and
in
harris
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
someone
suggested
before
that
that's
a
line
that's
sometimes
difficult
to
identify.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
sometimes
it's
a
moveable
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not
immutable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
often
than
not,
the
--
the
greatest
hope
that
a
prosecutor
has
in
any
case
is
that
the
defendant
will
take
the
stand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
--
it's
hardly
persuasive
to
suggest
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
cite
some
substantial
supporting
data?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
that's
why
i
suggest
the
prosecutor's
greatest
hope
is
that
the
defendant
will
take
the
stand.
prosecutor
can't
lose
by
that,
can
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
if
it's
worth
with
--
with
credibility
--
challenges
to
credibility,
the
jury
maybe
instructed
on
request
that
the
jury
is
to
consider
that
evidence
only
with
respect
to
credibility.
now,
i
emphasize
for
whatever
that's
worth
because
if
--
if
the
jury
may
treat
it
as
substantive
evidence
but
that
instruction,
precautionary
instruction
is
given,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
must
always
be
given
on
request.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
thomas
against
the
washington
gas
light
