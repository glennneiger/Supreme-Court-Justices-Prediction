justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
--
it's
--
it's
perfectly
--
rule
would
be
perfectly
rational
under
both
agnello
and
walder
that
said
that
government
cannot
use
the
illegally
seized
evidence
in
its
case
in
chief.
and
the
defendant
could
move
to
dismiss
and
to
close
the
case
in
chief,
under
agnello,
if
the
cocaine
had
been
introduced
at
the
government's
case
in
chief.
and
still
if
a
defendant
chooses
to
take
the
stand
or
if
the
government
--
and
the
government
chooses
to
cross-examine
him,
then
a
different
rule
might
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
battle
or
rebuttal
on
impeachment
are
two
quite
different
things,
are
they
not?
rebuttal
is
the
government's
going
forward
with
or
--
its
own
case
on
the
second
round
so
to
speak,
whereas
impeachment
is
an
effort
to
show
that
the
defendant's
case
is
not
to
be
believed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
agnello
speaks
in
terms
of
rebuttal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
is
that
if
the
government
or
the
--
the
--
in
--
in
a
civil
case,
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
feels
that
they
have
successfully
impeached
the
--
credibility
of
the
--
of
a
principal
opponent,
they
may
choose
not
to
put
on
any
rebuttal.
whereas,
if
they
think
the
matter
is
still
hanging
in
the
minds
of
the
jury,
they
may
call
two
or
three
more
witnesses
and
that
would
be
rebuttal,
but
not
impeachment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
and
what
fourth
amendment
problem
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
agnello
and
gouled
and
silverthorne
are
all
pretty
shaky,
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
jury
convicted
it,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
are
skinny
cases
and
fat
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
would
look
at
as
jury
verdicts
and
were
talking
about
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
have
everything.
i
mean,
you
--
you've
always
got
the
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
shouldn't
he
be
subjected
to
the
same
process
of
cross-examination
that
any
other
person
who
elects
to
testify
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
government
--
attorney
had
asked
on
cross-examination
of
the
defendant
who
had
voluntarily
elected
to
take
the
stand,
are
you
guilty
of
this
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
of
--
anything
wrong
with
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
true
only
in
almost
any
case
you
tried
though.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
counsel,
wishing
to
object,
has
to
think
over
quickly
in
his
mind
by
objecting,
do
i
call
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
more
than
if
i
just
sit
there
and
would
historically
and
act
as
if
it
didn't
make
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
--
not
at
the
moment
it
was
raised.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
before
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
your
--
your
last
discussions
pertain
to
so-called
policy
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
considerations.
would
you
think
it
to
be
at
all
weighed
in
the
balance
that
there
is
presumably
a
multibillion
dollar
traffic
in
illegally
some
smuggled
cocaine
coming
in
from
columbia
through
miami
and
that
the
--
a
truth
finding
prior
trial
least
impeded
by
exclusionary
processes
is
desirable?
