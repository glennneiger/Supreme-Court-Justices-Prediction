mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
both
novel
and
surprising
novel
and
that
the
carey
act
was
a
noble
experiment,
a
one
of
a
kind
statute
unique
in
concept
in
1894
and
never
again
duplicated.
novel
in
that
unlike
most
federal
statutes,
it's
only
been
before
this
court
once
in
its
84
years
of
existence,
and
surprising
in
that
the
act
is
before
the
court
again
at
all.
and
that
in
1970
the
department
of
interior
felt
that
the
act
was
so
obsolete
and
useless
said
it
repealed
all
of
the
carey
act
regulations
assuming
that
they'd
never
be
used
again.
as
the
solicitor
made
a
brief
reference,
technology
and
advances,
and
deep
well,
and
in
sprinkler
systems
have
now
restored
some
possibility
of
achieving
the
original
congressional
purpose
and
offer
an
opportunity
to
offset
something
up
to
2
million
acres
per
year
lost
and
farmland
every
year.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
continuing
investigation
in
review
of
those
aquifers
in
a
number
of
context
and
more
is
being
learned
about
them
everyday.
but
the
technology
and
the
efficiency
and
the
economy
of
drawing
water
and
well
more
cheaply
and
sprinkling
it
more
effectively
is
the
chief
reason
that
brings
life
back
into
this
act.
we
would
urge
that
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation
and
that
the
carey
act
granted
no
such
absolute
discretion
as
the
solicitor
describes
to
the
secretary.
we
would
urge
that
there
is
a
--
an
actual
case
or
controversy
right
for
consideration,
and
that
the
denials
of
this
--
of
this
particular
application
even
though
it'd
be
on
reserve
land,
where
in
fact
as
the
ibla
ruled
based
upon
an
absolute
secretarial
discretion
which
the
secretary
suggested,
flowed
from
the
language,
the
history
and
the
intent
of
the
carey
act
itself.perspective
on
the
carey
act
is
simple.
the
congress
in
1894
had
both
the
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
your
honor,
the
--
the
basis
for
denial
of
those
acres
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
was
the
secretary's
discretion.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
but
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
what
the
district
court
suggested
is
that
we
have
an
opportunity
to
go
back
in
and
should
have
if
the
carey
act
is
properly
interpreted
to
petition
for
reclassification
which
idaho
would
do.
but
the
secretary
says
that
he
has
the
absolute
discretion
and
will
not
permit
us
even
to
go
back
under
the
reclassification
procedure
thus
an
actual
case
or
controversy
is
framed.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
idaho
would
contend,
your
honor,
yes,
that
--
that
we
have
the
right
to
do
as
the
district
court
instructed
us
to
do,
to
petition
for
reclassification,
and
the
secretary
would
contend
that
we
have
no
such
right
because
he
exercises
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
claim
as
the
district
court
suggested
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
--
we
would
so
claim
yes.
but
it
would
be
upon
--
based
upon
evidence
and
material
presented
that
reclassification
hearing.
the
proper
perspective
of
carey
act
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
we
would
per
se
when
the
secretary
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
do,
when
the
secretary
--
especially
when
the
secretary
per
se,
contends
that
he
has
no
authority.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
then
we
would
not
so
--
we
would
not
so
contend
that
we
would
be
automatically
entitled
to
the
land
because
we
have
rejected
of
the
in
present
theory
which
we
presented
to
the
district
court.
we
suggest
now
that
the
carey
act
is
a
conditional
grant,
conditioned
upon
the
performance
of
--
of
certain
conditions
which
the
congress
specifically
outlined
in
1894.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
let
me
pursue
it
because
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
position.
it
would
be
your
view
that
you
could
get
the
27,000
acres
by
filing
a
petition
for
reclassification.
the
issue
in
that
proceeding
would
be
whether
or
not,
the
27,000
acres
had
been
properly
withdrawn
for
stock
driveway
purposes.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
would
suggest
at
that
point,
yes,
your
honor,
that
we
would
have
been
disadvantaged.
though,
we
would
suggest
unfairly
in
that
the
carey
act
and
this
entitled
to
flowing
from
the
act
of
1894
should
have
been
originally
considered
when
the
secretary
went
through
the
machinations
of
--
and
--
and
considerations
in
all
those
other
reservations.
and
in
addition,
it's
important
to
note
that
it
is
not
likely
or
possible
or
feasible
for
a
block
of
3
million
acres
to
be
sought
under
the
carey
act,
and
it's
also
important
to
note
that
there
is
no
such
sword
hanging
over
the
secretary
to
make
and
discomfort
his
--
his
discretion
in
this
regard.
there
being
33
million
acres,
as
we
note
in
the
brief,
for
federal
lands
in
idaho,
12
million
under
the
control
and
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
approximately
8.5
million
susceptible
of
possible
irrigation
is
still
in
federal
hands.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
--
it
is
in
this
sense.
the
carey
act
obviously,
by
its
terms,
identifies
no
specific
lands,
and
we
claim
no
entitlement
as
to
any
specific
parcel.
but
as
to
a
general
right
of
entitlement
which
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
secretary
in
his
classification
and
planning
process
and
should
have
been
since
1894,
we
urge
that
position
on
the
court.
but
the
district
court's
position
actually
says
is
that
it
draws
a
very
careful
distinction,
it
suggest
a
very
careful
balance
between
the
rights
of
the
state
and
the
rights
of
the
secretary
rejecting
the
idaho
in
presenti
argument
rejecting
the
u.s.
argument
about
right
discretion,
instead
holding
that
there's
a
right
of
entitlement
under
the
carey
act
created
by
the
congress.
that
that
right
is
not
so
absolute
that
the
state
can
perfunctorily
select
any
particular
parcel
of
land
that
wishes
for
the
secretary
has
other
withdrawal
authority.
but
third,
if
the
state
meets
the
carey
act
conditions,
the
secretary
has
no
unfettered
discretion
to
deny
applications.
fourth,
if
the
land
sought
has
been
withdrawn
for
other
purposes,
the
state
may
apply
for
reclassification
which
petition
should
be
handled
in
the
ordinary
course
and
subject
to
judicial
review.
and
fifth,
since
congress
prescribed
acreage
entitlements
to
the
state
in
1894,
the
secretary
should
preserve
suitable
amounts
to
honor
applications
as
they
come
in
overtime.
that's
exactly
what
the
judge's
decision
did.
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history,
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
it
properly
addresses
the
administrative
and
contemporaneous
construction
given
to
it
by
the
agency.
the
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
not
--
not
automatically,
your
honor,
for
the
acreage
and
entitlement
and
reservation
and
potential
for
carey
act
application
was
there.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
there's
a
present
case
or
controversy
because
in
this
particular
identification
of
acreage,
a
part
of
that
3
million
acres
the
ibla
and
the
secretary
assert
that
they
can
--
they
can
reject
to
have
right
in
their
absolute
discretion
or
opportunity
to
--
to
petition
them
for
a
contract
on
that
acreage.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
it's
--
it's
our
--
it's
our
suggestion
of
the
court
that
ibla
exercises
exactly
such
an
absolute
discretion
because
they
intended
to
and
so
they
did
in
this
particular
partial
in
acreage.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
the
--
the
partial
is
withdrawn.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
and
they
are
suggesting
that
they
will
not
entertain,
as
the
district
court
suggested
they
must
or
petition
for
reclassification
because
they
have
the
absolute
discretion
under
the
carey
act
not
to
do
so.
but
nothing
about
the
language
of
the
carey
act,
nothing
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
carey
act,
nothing
about
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
carey
act
suggest
any
such
absolute
discretion
of
the
secretary.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
in
fact,
that's
accurate.
the
--
there
were
four
separate
types
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
no.
as
to
--
as
to
a
federal
reclamation
project,
as
to
a
wildlife
reserved,
as
to
some
state
land
grant
exchanges,
idaho
did
not
press
its
claim
forward.
showing
again
that
it's
--
that
it's
eminently
possible
for
the
state
and
the
secretary
to
work
in
this
fashion
then
acknowledge
the
secretary's
other
duties
if
the
secretary
does
not
have
any
absolute
discretion
as
the
search
flaws
from
the
act
of
1894,
and
that
discretion
is
simply
not
there.
a
study
of
the
statutory
language
with
reference
to
the
contract
authority
of
the
secretary,
the
special
duties
detailed
the
secretary
--
of
legislative
debates
and
discussions,
none
of
those
factors
and
features
make
any
mention
of
any
general
and
unfettered
discretion
to
the
secretary.
the
contract
contemplated
by
the
carey
act
is
nothing
more
or
nothing
less
an
--
an
agreement
of
feasibility
as
to
certain
lands
and
a
protection
to
states
and
the
settlers
on
those
lands
which
are
identified
and
may
guarantee
that
as
to
dollars
expended
and
efforts
expended
the
states
and
the
sellers
will
be
protected.
congress
had
already,
in
a
sense,
by
the
terms
of
the
act
made
an
offer
to
the
states
and
the
states
accepted
that
offer
and
it
was
--
it
was
that
kind
of
arrangement,
that
kind
of
conditional
grant
that
the
carey
act
contemplated.
in
the
language
of
the
act,
the
specific
duties
of
the
secretary
are
detailed
to
accept
applications,
review
maps
and
plans.
to
review
for
their
sufficiency
to
accomplish
the
irrigation
and
needed
and
desire
to
--
to
--
as
fast
as
adequate
proof
is
received
to
issue
the
patents
and
to
produce
such
rules
and
regulations
but
only
as
to
the
motive
proof
and
motive
procedure.
there
is
no
general
discretion
encouraged
or
authorized
in
the
statutory
language.
and
what
--
and
if
any
such
discretion
was
intended
or
contemplated
by
the
congress,
it
would
have
been
a
discretion
that
would
have
to
had
the
potential
as
in
this
case
to
frustrate
the
--
the
noble
purpose
which
congress
sought,
namely,
for
meeting
the
states
to
go
forward
in
the
absence
of
federal
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
justice
white,
again,
the
secretary
in
the
new
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
it
would
not
automatically
override
write
such
withdrawal.
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
make
the
petition,
and
the
secretary
would
have
the
right
to
balance
the
equities
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
exactly.
and
--
and
we
would
have
the
right
to
require
the
secretary
to
review
the
matter.in
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
again,
we
would
be
entitled
to
request
other
--
of
the
secretary
and
identify
and
petition
to
him
for
carey
act
application
in
withdrawal
and
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
justice
white
presented
a
harder
case
suggesting
that
lawful
grants
had
--
had
already
been
issued
dropping
us
below
the
3
million.
but
--
but
were
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
not
unless
either
congress
modified
the
carey
act
or
idaho
modified
its
terms
and
conditions
of
acceptance
of
the
carey
act.
the
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
it
will
be
our
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
is
a
conditional
entitlement
in
an
already
conceived
congressional
purpose
flowing
from
1894,
we
would
acknowledge
that
the
acts
and
the
management
duties
of
the
secretary
need
to
be
read
together.
we
would
not
necessarily
presume
that
a
court
would
find
that
the
carey
act
either
was
subservient
to
a
later
act
or
nor
would
be
presume
that
it
would
overwrite
it.
i
can't
--
i
can't
answer
the
question
directly.
i
think
that
i
would
not
guess
what
the
court
might
do.
but
i
would
say
that
the
congressional
entitlement
from
1894
would
be
of
equal
dignity
in
--
in
before
a
court
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
conditional
(voice
overlap)
-
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
would
--
we
would
suggest
that
that
would
likely
be
a
--
a
result
in
court.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
not
so
in
a
sense
that
the
--
that
the
judge
also
acknowledges
that
reclassification
procedure
and
judicial
review
are
available
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
but
in
--
in
the
sense
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
in
the
sense
that
he
says
very
directly
that
3
million
acres
ought
to
be
reserved,
so
that
from
time
to
time,
applications
can
be
made.
yes,
it
would
be
slightly
inconsistent.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
well,
your
honor,
there
is
an
entitlement
of
entitlement
flows
from
a
congressional
act
in
1894.and
as
to
--
as
to
other
acts
including
oil
shale
activities,
they
would
--
they
were
necessarily
be
a
reading
together
before
a
court
of
--
of
those.
but
we
contend
before
the
court
that
the
district
judge
was
correct
in
urging
an
entitlement
in
the
nature
of
a
--
a
grant
upon
condition
flowed
from
the
carey
act.
we
would
also
urge
that
the
--
the
department
of
interior
has
not
properly
presented
to
the
court
their
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
act.
the
--
immediately
after
the
act
in
1894,
a
key
to
the
case
would
be
a
review
of
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior.
in
those
regulations,
the
first
promulgated
under
authority
of
the
act
was
absolutely
no
mention
of
secretarial
discretion.
and
in
1895,
report
to
congress,
annually
made
every
year
as
house
document
number
5,
the
general
land
office
commissioner
to
the
secretary
said,
in
characterizing
the
carey
act,
that
this
is
a
form
of
agreement
to
donate
a
million
acres
of
desert
land
upon
a
condition
and
continued
onward.
the
secretary
of
the
congress
described
the
carey
act
as
a
grant
condition
upon
the
reclamation
and
settlement.
it's
our
contention
that
it
was
interior
not
idaho
that
first
characterized
the
carey
act
as
a
grant
upon
condition.
and
in
that
same
year,
1895,
idaho
accepted
the
grant
of
the
carey
act
by
legislative
activity
that
specifically
referred
to
the
carey
act
as
a
grant.
the
annual
reports
of
the
department
of
interior
if
reviewed
from
1895
to
1905
contained
grant
language
including
the
1895
reference
to
the
grant
condition.
there's
no
discretion
mentioned
in
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
in
1895,
idaho
became
the
second
state
to,
through
its
state
legislature,
pass
the
statute
that
--
that
accepted
the
donation,
the
grant
of
congress
with
regard
to
the
carey
act.
there
were
12
such
states
in
the
west
that
accepted
that
and
each
of
those
12
states,
in
one
way
or
another,
discussed
the
carey
act
by
that
language.
10
of
the
12
states
accepted
the
grant
of
congress,
the
grant
of
congress
intended
in
the
carey
act.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
the
purpose
of
those
several
carey
acts
were
also
to
set
up
a
structure
whereby
contracts
could
be
entered
in
with
construction
companies
to
construct
the
works
necessary
to
transport
the
waters
long
distances
and
apply
water
to
the
land
and
as
well,
contemplated
boards
and
land
commissioners
to
receive
applications
and
administer
the
actual
settlers
who
filed
under
the
act.
one
of
the
greatest
dignities
in
terms
of
the
departmental
position
on
what
the
carey
act
actually
meant
there
was
such
rules
and
regulations.
there've
been
five
such
sets
of
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
between
1894
on
the
time
of
this
particular
lawsuit.
in
1894,
the
regulations,
immediately
after
the
promulgation
of
the
act,
made
no
mention
of
secretarial
discretion.
in
1898,
the
--
the
word
“grant”
was
mentioned
four
times
in
those
regulations,
discretion
not
mentioned
at
all.
in
1902,
the
word
"grant"
was
mentioned
four
times,
discretion
not
mentioned
at
all,
except
in
the
context
of
a
limited
1901
amendment.
and
in
1902
regulations
which
provision
became
identical
in
the
1909
regulations
a
very
careful
two-step
process
whereby
the
general
land
office
would
review
the
applications
and
then
upon
their
approval
for
that
technical
sufficiency,
submit
them
to
the
secretary.
the
regulation
said,
“upon
approval,
the
contract
is
executed
by
the
secretary
as
directed
by
the
act.”
that
regulation
continued
in
effect
in
1909.
and
those
1909
regulations
were
in
effect
until
repealed
in
1970.
we
would
urge
that
the
secretary,
by
his
administrative
construction,
neither
contemplated
discretion
and
characterized
by
the
--
at
the
--
to
the
contrary
that
the
act
was
in
fact
the
grant
of
the
states.
the
doctrine
of
contemporaneous
consistent
administrative
construction
suggest
that
if
a
statute
is
susceptible
of
two
reasonable
interpretations
and
the
department
adopts
interpretation
a,
and
great
deference
ought
to
be
accorded
to
a
but
it
never
said
that
if
the
department
adopts
a
in
1895
and
then
somehow
in
1977
and
1975
switches
to
be
contending
that
no
discretion
and
no
mention
of
discretion
has
become
absolute
discretion
that
the
court
ought
to
incur
--
attach
any
difference
to
the
later
construction.
had
congress
intended
the
secretary
to
have
any
absolute
discretion
of
this
type
so
significant
as
to
frustrate
the
statutory
purpose
in
the
great
noble
objective
of
the
carey
act,
it
certainly
would
have
authorized
it
in
clear
and
specific
language.
we
thus
contend
that
both
legislative
history
and
administrative
construction
suggest
no
such
discretion
existed.
the
subsequent
acts
by
congress
indeed
also
characterized
the
carey
act
as
a
grant
in
1896
amendment,
characterized
it
as
a
grant.
in
1901
amendment,
congress
illustrated
that
it
knew
how
to
use
the
words
in
his
discretion
with
the
secretary
and
giving
him
a
five
year
extension
privilege
that
used
those
very
words
in
his
discretion.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
that
same
year,
as
we
indicate
at
page
8
of
our
brief,
issued
a
letter
in
assistance
of
congress
in
attempting
to
establish
what
the
legislative
purpose
and
intent
might
be
for
the
amendment.
and
secretary
of
interior
hitchcock
in
that
letter,
four
times
mentioned
that
he
characterized
the
carey
act
as
a
grant
to
the
states.
first
mentioning,
“a
grant
made
the
certain
states.”
next,
“grant
was
a
departure”.
third,
“lands
intended
to
be
granted”,
and
fourth,
“under
this
grant.”
in
the
1921
amendment
to
the
carey
act,
the
restoration
privileges
to
the
secretary
to
return
lands
the
public
domain
if
construction
not
began
within
three
years,
provided
secretary
may,
in
his
discretion,
commit
that
act.
thus
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
no,
mr.
justice,
we
would
not
suggest
that
congress
cannot
change
its
mind.
the
--
the
features
of
the
conditional
grant
are
that
no
title
would
pass
until
the
conditions
are
fulfilled,
thus,
we
would
urge
that
no
equitable
title
attaches
until
the
same.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
mention,
but
a
good
deal
of
authority
is
placed
in
the
brief
of
interior
on
the
wyoming
land
decision
reported
in
1908.
we
would
urge
to
this
court
that
that
land
decision
which
found
some
discretion
in
the
secretary's
opportunity
to
contract
is
not
a
proper
administrative
construction.
it's
not
consistence
with
the
secretary's
own
rules
and
regulations.
it's
not
strictly
contemporaneous.
it's
not
--
it's
based
on
a
faulty
reasoning
that
it
is
no
authority,
that
it's
not
persuasive
and
it
never
was
embraced
by
congress
nor
even
called
to
congress's
attention,
and
it
remained
obscure
within
the
department
in
that
it
was
not
even
contemplated
and
grafted
into
the
1909
rules
and
regulations
as
the
secretary
promulgated
them
some
six
months
later.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
the
difference,
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
is
that
they
say
they
have
the
absolute
discretion
to
contemplate
receiving
no
applications
at
all
the
receiving,
no
petitions
for
reclassification
at
all,
to
not
giving
us
the
time
of
day
on
the
carey
act.
and
they
also
urge
that
if
there
is
no
entitlement
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
we'd,
to
the
contrary,
contend
that
the
carey
act
created
neither
an
absolute
grant
nor
an
absolute
discretion.
but
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
challenge
the
states
to
pick
up
a
great
and
noble
public
purpose
that
the
--
the
department
of
interior
acknowledged
in
1895
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
conditional
grant,
that
by
legislative
action,
the
states
accepted
that
grant
and
began
to
operate
on
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
department
which,
for
74
years,
characterized
both
the
act
as
a
grant
and
suggested
that
the
department
of
interior
and
the
secretary
of
interior
had
no
authority
to
do
anything
after
that
technical
approval
but
signed
the
contract
as
directed
by
law.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
the
government
has
deprived
those
by
the
stands
that
they've
taken
in
the
ibla
and
by
the
secretary
of
interior
of
an
opportunity
to
seek
any
lands
under
the
carey
act,
saying
that
they
have
in
their
absolute
discretion.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
they
did
not
deny
us
an
access
to
the
--
the
outer
office.
but
they
deny
us
access
to
any
decision
making
process
and
they've
not
so
granted
any
carey
acts
in
idaho
in
the
last
30
years.
and
it's
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
they
have
taken
the
position
before
the
ibla
that
they
will
not
in
this
instance
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
the
case
or
controversy
actually
frame.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
on
this
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
no,
sir.
but
they
will
not
exercise
any
discretion
in
either
the
state
billing
office
or
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
that
resulted
in
this
actual
case
not
--
that's
not
being
a
lot
of
petition
for
reclassification
with
any
likelihood
of
success.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
did
apply
for
both
a
temporary
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes.
and
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
we
applied
for
both
a
temporary
withdraw
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
--
and
for
a
segregation.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
but
in
--
in
construing
the
statute
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
it's
not
possible
now.
he's
finally
with
agency
action
close
the
door
and
rest
his
position
on
an
assertion
of
absolute
discretion
formed
in
1894
act.
we
suggest
there's
no
such
discretion
there.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
it
prevents
us
from,
as
to
these
particular
lands,
the
possibility
of
moving
them
in
the
carey
act
development
from
framing
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes.
and
--
and
the
vehicle
of
--
of
that
denial
was
an
assertion
of
absolute
discretion
and
a
refusal
to
follow
the
dictate
of
the
district
court
in
allowing
us
to
petition
for
reclassification
and
determining.
mr.
david
h.
leroy
alright.
and
i've
indicated
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
david
h.
leroy
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
