there
a

you're

i

there

john

and
you
think
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
argue
that
in
your
point.
their
theory,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
they
had
a
present
grant
of
3
million
acres,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
justice
john
paul

so
that's
what
they
allege.
justice
john

this
argument
was
weighed

made,
as
i
understood
it,
to
say
that
the
27,000
acres
that
had
been
preempted
for
highway
rights
away
or
something
like
that,
i
forget
what
it
was,
that
that
preemption
by
the
secretary
was
invalid

reservation
by
the
secretary
was
invalid
because
it
had

the
land
had
previously
been
made
available

the

that
their
position?

john

how
much
is
available
still,
some
11

isn't
there?
justice
john

how
can
this
controversy

some

correct

did

did
he
get
reasons
in
those

justice
john

now,
i'm
--
justice
john

--
totally
baffled
because
i
read
the
district
court
opinion
to
reject
idaho's
claim
that
the
27,000
acres
and
his
judgment
to
reject.

is
that
wrong?

the
sword
as
i
--
they
still
got
11
million
acres
that
are
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
is
there
in
idaho?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
lot
more
than
3
million
acres.
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
allocation
that,
as
i
understood
it,
that
was
imposed
under
the
government
to
save
at
least
3
million
acres.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
present
indication
he
intends
to
do
that,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
there
--
i
thought
it
was
11
million
acres,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
i
don't
know.
but
as
long
as
there,
you
know,
three
or
four
times
much
land
as
might
be
needed
to
fulfill
the
--
the
commitment
made
in
1894,
assuming
there
was
a
commitment
or
the
--
the
tender,
whatever
you
might
describe
it,
i
just
don't
see
any
damocles
and
sword
over
anybody.
they
--
if
they
came
in
and
asked
for
some
land
and
the
secretary
turn
it
down,
sure
you
get
a
lawsuit.
or
if
he
said,
"i
can
handle

all
the

of

then
they
may
want

justice

and
of
course,
he
had
turned
them
down
properly.
justice
john
paul

it
shows
how
ripe
this
case,
even
the
same
issue
has
been
available
for
40
or
50
years,
there
is
no
problem
arose
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
three
years.
really
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
27,000
acres
application
was
denied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
clarify
this
one.
on
the
particular
land
that
was
subject
to
the
application
in
dispute
in
this
case,
does
idaho
still
contend
that
it's
entitled
to
have
that
--
those
27,000
acres
conveyed
pursuant
to
the
carey
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
--
you
said,
they
gave
the
wrong
reason.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
contend
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
you're
entitled
to
those
27,000
acres?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
on
your
answer
to
my
question.
is
idaho
still
contending
that
it
has
a
right
to
these
27,000
acres?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
then,
if
the
--
if
the
withdrawal
for
those
purposes
was
authorized
by
statute
and
it
was
not
an
abuse
to
discretion,
then
you
would
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
would
have
no
carey
act
right
to
those
27,000
acres.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
under
your
understanding
of
the
district
court
ruling,
as
long
as
at
least
3
million
acres
remained
unclassified
for
any
purpose
under
desert
land,
could
therefore
--
thereafter
be
selected
by
idaho,
would
there
be
any
violation
on
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
the
--
is
it
not
also
true
that
--
that
if
--
if
the
secretary
purported
to
withdraw
so
much
that
there
was
less
than
3
million
available,
you
would
then
have
a
right
under
the
judgment
to
enjoin
him
or
to
prevent
him
from
making
that
additional
withdraw?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
anything
that
invaded
the
3
million
would
be
subject
to
reclassification
made
available.
but
if
that's
all
true,
how
can
there
be
a
present
controversy
until
you
approach
the
area
of
withdrawal
that
would
invade
the
3
million
figure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
the
best
way
to
challenge
that
is
by
making
a
request
for
some
of
that
land
and
having
them
do
it.
if
they
never
--
if
they
--
they
say
have
the
power,
but
suppose
they
never
exercise
such
arbitrary
power,
that
they
always
grant
your
applications,
why
do
we
have
to
decide
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
the
27,000.
there's
--
that's
withdrawn
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
complaining
that
they
gave
the
wrong
reason
for
something
they
have
a
perfectly
lawful
right
to
do,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
leroy,
supposing
the
oil
shale
withdrawal
covered
7
million
acres?
so
there's
less
than
3
million
would
be
available,
would
that
be
permitted
under
your
view?it
clearly
would
not
under
the
district
judge's
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
this
sir,
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
do
that.
he
couldn't
--
they
could
not
invade
the
3
million,
they
must
reserve
at
all
times
at
least
3
million
acres
for
carey
act
development.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
true.
but
now,
we're
talking
about
--
there
now
are
more
than
3
million
acres
available,
and
the
question
is
under
your
interpretation
to
district
court's
holding,
could
they
with
--
could
the
secretary
withdraw
enough
acreage
to
invade
the
3
million
and
have
the
withdrawal
for
the
purposes
of
shale
oil.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
ought
to
be
reasonably
the
words
that
mr.
smith
called
my
attention
to
--
are
--
it
is
likewise
clear
that
the
carey
act
conferred
upon
the
state
of
idaho
a
right
of
entitlement
to
3
million
acres
of
--
of
land
suitable
for
irrigation.
and
i
think
you're
saying
that
when
we
--
if
we
have
this
oil
shale
conflict
problem
way
down
in
the
future
somewhere,
we
ought
to
decide
that
one
that
arises,
which
is
exactly
what
i've
been
suggesting
for
some
time
here.
