justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
you
say
that
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
must
reserve
indefinitely
the
3
million
acres
reserved
or
mentioned
in
the
carey
act.
actually,
all
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
is
27,000
--
an
application
for
27,000
acres.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
--
the
state
is
bound
by
the
case
or
controversy
and
all
the
other
related
requirements
of
article
iii,
the
same
way
any
other
litigant
in
its
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
secretary's
action
in
declining
the
27,000
acres
where
a
request
was
perfectly
proper.
if
it's
reviewable
at
all,
would
we
then
have
to
go
and
expatiate
the
way
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
day
after
the
carey
act
was
passed,
idaho
could've
gone
in
the
federal
district
court
in
idaho
and
asked
for
--
to
serve
of
a
declaratory
judgment
not
that
it
was
ready
with
any
plan
but
just
requiring
the
secretary
to
make
sure
it
didn't
let
the
original
1
million
acres
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
that's
the
intimation
at
the
bottom
of
page
18a
of
the
petition
where
the
district
court
has
--
however,
the
state
may
not
perfunctorily
select
acreage
previously
withdrawn
for
other
purposes
such
as
in
this
case
withdraw
for
stock
driveways.
the
district
court
wasn't
saying
the
idaho's
application
in
this
case
should
have
been
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
--
is
that
really
a
--
a
case
or
article
iii
lawsuit
where
the
government
says,
“we
ought
to
win
on
this
ground.”
and
the
district
court
says,
“you
ought
to
win
on
a
narrower
ground”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
deny
without
any
judicial
review
under
the
overton
park
theory
that
there
is
simply
no
standard
set
forth
by
which
you
may
determine
whether
they
grant
it
or
deny
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
--
then
you
--
he
--
do
you
think
his
action
in
denial
could
be
reviewed
under
the
apa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
secretary
simply
said,
the
carey
act
is
an
authorization
and
nothing
more,
and
i
just
don't
choose
to
allot
under
the
carey
act.
i
realize
i
could,
but
i
--
i
just
don't
feel
like
doing
it.
would
that
be
an
adequate
response?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
--
what
you're
saying
that
the
carey
act
is
the
factor
that
the
secretary
has
to
take
into
consideration
in
passing
on
any
application
for
withdrawal
of
public
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
if
the
secretary
in
response
to
the
type
of
situation
posed
by
justice
stevens
said,
"i
recognized
the
carey
act,
i
recognized
the
oil
shale
act,
it
necessarily
requires
me
to
balance
the
needs
for
uses
of
public
land
and
in
the
exercise
of
my
informed
discretion,
i
grant
the
oil
shale
act
withdrawals,"
would
you
feel
that
you
had
anything
more
than
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
abuse
of
discretion
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
on
flat
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
not
of
flat
provision
against
the
secretary's
reserving
into
the
3
million
allocated
to
idaho,
if
he
could
sustain
a
classification
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
judge
reviewing
it
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
idaho
do
in
1895?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
set
up
a
mechanism
whereby
private
settlers
could
make
claims
analogous
to
the
way
you
make
mineral
claims
or
homestead
claims
by
locating
on
the
property
and
residing
on
it
for
a
year?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
real
argument
here?
not
between
you
and
the
district
court
or
between
the
government
and
the
district
court,
but
between
you
and
the
government,
because
the
government,
as
i
undertake,
concedes
that
the
secretary's
actions
are
subject
to
review
and
that
the
carey
act
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
you
concede
that
the
carey
act
isn't
an
outright
grant.
and
that
the
secretary
could
invade
the
minimum
amount
or
the
maximum
amount
granted,
if
he
could
show
sufficient
justification
for
it.
i
--
i
don't
see
there's
much
difference
in
your
position.
