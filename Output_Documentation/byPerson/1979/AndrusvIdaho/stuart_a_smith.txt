mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
whether
the
carey
act
of
1894
requires
the
secretary
of
interior
indefinitely
to
reserve
from
appropriation
for
other
public
or
private
uses,
some
2.4
million
acres
of
desert
land
within
idaho
for
the
eventuality
that
the
state
may
be
able
and
willing
to
select
all
or
any
part
of
such
acreage
for
irrigation
and
reclamation
under
this
statute.
the
statute
is
set
forth
at
pages
2
through
5
of
the
petition.
its
language,
in
our
view,
is
clear
and
direct.
it
authorizes
the
secretary
of
interior
with
the
approval
of
the
president
is,
as
the
statute
says,
authorized
and
empowered
upon
proper
application
of
the
state
to
contract
and
agree
from
time
to
time
with
each
of
the
states
to
enter
into
contracts
with
the
states
which
will
then
be
binding
upon
the
united
states
to
donate
grant
and
patent
to
the
state
certain
desert
lands
not
exceeding
a
particular
amount
of
acreage
in
each
state
on
the
condition
that
the
state
covers
them
to
be
irrigated,
reclaimed
and
occupied.
the
statute
provides
that
after
the
secretary
approves
the
state's
application
for
grant,
the
land
is
then
segregated
from
the
public
domain
for
a
period
of
three
to
15
years
to
permit
the
state
to
undertake
the
required
reclamation
and
irrigation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that's
the
way
the
--
mr.
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
case
originally
arose
on
the
--
on
the
state's
application
for
27,400
acre
tract
to
reserve
that
under
the
temporary
withdrawal
statute
of
1910
which
permits
the
state
to
ask
for
a
temporary
segregation
in
advance
of
a
plan.
the
--
that
application
was
rejected
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
on
the
--
for
the
reason
that
the
--
that
some
--
some
of
that
land
was
being
used
for
stock
driveway
purposes.
the
state
then
appealed
that
determination
to
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals.
and
that
--
and
that
body
that
administrative
body
within
interior
affirmed
and
rejected
the
state's
argument
which
in
part
was
focused
on
the
--
on
that
particular
tract
but
the
state
then
began
to
make
the
broader
argument
that
it
was
entitled
to
have
a
reservation
of
its
maximum
quota
under
the
act.
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals,
the
state
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
of
idaho
for
--
to
withdraw
declaratory
relief.
and
specifically,
it
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
state
has
an
absolute
right
to
demand
up
to
3
million
acres
of
desert
land,
and
that
the
board
of
land
management
--
the
bureau
of
land
management,
that
is,
has
no
discretion
to
deny
request
for
segregation
of
desert
lands.
so,
the
case,
well,
you're
right
that
the
case
originally
arose
out
of
this
narrow
application,
but
it
became
--
it
became
broader
as
the
state
requested
broader
relief,
a
relief
which
the
district
court
granted
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
--
that's
--
i
--
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
i
think
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
here,
because
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
court
--
of
the
district
court
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
since
before
this
court
requiring
the
secretary
of
interior
to
--
to
withdraw
and
--
you
know
to
withdraw
--
you
know
to
manage
the
public
lands
in
a
way
to
ensure
that
idaho
will
ultimately
get
its
3
million
acre
quarters.
in
fact
the
--
the
judgment
says
that
idaho
is
entitled
to
have
withdrawn
and
patented
3
million
acres
providing
that
(a)
that
they're
all
lands
of
such
character
in
kind,
and
that
the
state
fulfills
the
condition.
so
there
is
--
i
think
the
controversy
between
the
parties
is
now
over,
you
know,
the
propriety
of
this
judgment.
although
i
agree
with
you
that
originally,
the
case
started
with
this
application
for
a
withdrawal
of
a
particular
tract.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
go
on
to
the
extent
that
we
have
this
judgment
binding
the
secretary
of
interior
to
reserve,
you
know,
on
the
event
--
the
3
million
acres
on
the
eventuality
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
it
would
get
rid
of
it,
although,
i
think,
you
know,
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
you
know,
a
case
or
a
controversy
between
the
parties
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
because
i
think
that
the
--
the
state
has
brought
a
lawsuit.
i
think
--
you
know,
i
think
the
chronology
of
it
is
such
that
the
case
arose
out
of
the
particular
application
for
the
27,400
acre
tract.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
but
i
think
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
district
court
and,
you
know,
granted
the
states
--
you
know,
request
for
the
prayer
for
declamatory
relief
ordering
the
secretary
to
have
withdrawn,
that
idaho
was
entitled
to
have
withdrawn
and
patented
3
million
acres
of
land.
i
think
that
from
the
secretary's
point
of
view,
if
he
were
to
allocate
public
lands
for
other
purposes
under
the
host
of
other
federal
statutes
that
--
that
he
administers
for
all
the
public
domain,
and
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
quarter
acre
go
below
3
million,
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
i
would
violate
the
judgment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
i
think
that's
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
correctness
of
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
the
idaho
--
you
know
i
think,
we
would
take
the
position
that
idaho
would
not
be
entitled
to,
you
know,
that
kind
of
relief.
but
i
don't
see
any
--
any,
you
know,
anything
that
would,
you
know,
prevent
idaho
from
doing
it,
and
if
a
court,
like
this
district
court
so
hold,
i
think
that
the
secretary
would
be
before
reviewing
court
the
way
we
have
petitioned
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
our
position.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
is
this
the
view
that
the
government
expressed
idaho
in
the
administrative
proceedings?
yes
i
mean
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
the
argument
was
framed
below
where
the
state
was
arguing
that
the
carey
act
gave
it,
you
know,
the
day
it
was
enacted
gave
it
an
absolute
right
to
3
million
acres
and
that
this
right
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
district
court
rejected
the
argument
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
there
was
in
present
a
grant
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
you
look
on
--
if
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
18a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
where
the
court
says
that
in
--
in
presenting
a
grant
of
title
did
not
occur
under
the
carey
act
seems
quite
clear
from
the
language
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history,
administrative
interpretations
and
court
interpretations
all
be
a
dicta.
it
is
likewise
clear,
however,
that
the
carey
act
in
subsequent
enactments
conferred
upon
the
state
of
idaho
a
right
of
entitlement
to
3
million
acres
of
desert
land
for
irrigation
etcetera.
and
i
think
that's
--
that's
in
the
opinion.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
they
had
a
present
grant
of
3
million
acres
--
well,
i
mean,
the
district
court
interpreted
the
--
you
know,
their
claim
to
and
then
present
a
grant
as
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
their
right
to
a
--
you
know,
a
particular
3
million
acres
and
said
that
the
state
didn't
have
a
right
to
any
particular
3
million
acres,
but
it
does
have
a
right
to
3
million
acres
of
suitable
desert
land,
and
that
the
secretary
has
to
manage
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
their
position
was
on
that
--
the
position
on
the
--
they
did
appeal.
their
in
presenti
argument
went
to
the
27,400
acre
thing.
they
said
basically
that
they
had
a
right
to
that
--
i
think
perhaps
we're
saying
the
same
thing.
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
that
particular
land
and
they
--
and
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you
know,
on
there
and
present
a
grant.
but
the
--
but
the
secretary
also
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
they
had
any
right
to
any
particular
acreage.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
are
some
11
million
acres,
i
think,
total
overall
the
--
overall
the
states
that
the
carey
act
touches.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
controversy
is
right
to
the
extent
that
the
--
that
the
state
has
asked
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
has
granted
this
declaratory
relief
essentially.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
--
that
may
well
be
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
and
then
they
will
not
be,
because
as
--
i
think
we
point
out
and
argue
at
great
length
and
there
are
host
of
federal
statutes
and
secretary
has
to
manage
federal
--
you
know,
this
public
domain
under
variety
of
statutes.
i
think
that
this
--
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
parties
and
that
the
western
states
need
clarifications
to
meaning
of
the
carey
act
can't
be
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
in
this
particular
case,
the
second
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
the
complaint
did
raise
the
issue
in
the
sense
that
it
--
it
talked
about
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
first
count
of
the
complaint
because
i
think
the
second
count
of
the
complaint
went
to
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
no.
but
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
record
appendix,
i
think.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
but
i
--
looking
at
page
5,
this
is
the
defendant's
age
and
he's
notified
plaintiff.
he
will
not
allow
request
segregation
was
wrong
to
the
carey
act
as
a
matter
of
right.
the
defendant's
specific
alleges
the
--
it
has
the
authority
to
determine
what
lands
are
suitable
for
disposal
under
the
carey
act
even
though
lands
refuse
to
be
granted
on
fact
desert
unsuitable
for
agricultural
use
and
settlement
etcetera.
the
plaintiff
believes
that
these
lands
are
subject
to
temporary
withdrawals.
i
think
that
--
you
know,
i
think
that
the
issue
is
--
is
joined
before
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
was
the
--
you
know,
the
controversy
--
the
controversy
was
--
it
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
--
what?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
--
well,
i
mean
they
cannot
--
they
could've
identified
indeed
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
3
million
acres.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
difference
between
the
administrative
proceeding
and
this
lawsuit
can
be
best
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
while
the
state
--
while
this
thing
was
--
while
the
administrative
action
was
pending
in
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals,
the
state
brought
this
action
for
broader
declaratory
relief
and
its
that
relief,
i
think,
that
the
district
court
grappled
with
and
determined
was
appropriate.
it
did
reject
the
in
present
their
argument,
but
it
did
nevertheless
hold
and
i
think
that
the
opinion
couldn't
really
any
be
clearer
that
--
that
the
carey
act
confers
upon
the
state
of
right
of
entitlement
to
3
million
acres.
it's
the
--
it's
that
the
--
it's
--
it's
the
seriousness
of
that
judgment.
they've
caused
us
to
petition.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
could
not
--
i
could
not
state
to
you
with
complete
certainty
that
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
thing
to
do,
but
i
can
say
to
you,
number
one,
that
we
think
that
the
broader
relief
that
the
state
has
requested
and
the
broader
relief
that
the
district
court
has
--
has
granted,
has
put
this
question
before
the
court.
the
--
since,
since
this
cases
come,
the
board
of
land
and
--
the
bureau
of
land
and
management
has
rejected
two
state
applications
for
--
from
idaho
for
--
since
the
district
court
decision
under
the
carey
act.
our
petition
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
and
since
that
--
there
was
also
--
there
was
also
brewing
in
nevada,
as
we
point
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
petition,
a
host
of
applications
that
are
getting
ready
to
be
filed.
and
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
secretary's
--
the
--
i
don't
think
the
secretary
has
to
give
reasons,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
the
secretary
--
i
don't
think
the
secretary
--
i
don't
think
the
secretary
did
give
reasons.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
in
that
--
i
think
in
that
effect
of
the
district
court's
judgment
has
to
be
read
that
way,
because
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
idaho
is
not
entitled
to
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
anything.
in
fact
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
and
i
think
that
--
you
know,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
district
court
went
--
i
think
the
district
court
ordered
the
--
you
know
--
i
think
idaho
has
to
go
back
for
--
and
petition
for
reclassification
of
the
27,000
under
the
carey
act.
that
was
--
that
was
the
impression
--
that
was
the
impression
i
got
from
the
district
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
should
not
be
arbitrarily
denied.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
shouldn't
have
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
because
our
--
our
view
of
the
matters
that
the
secretary
has
complete
discretion
as
to
whether
the
grant
application
is
under
the
carey
act.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
--
i
think
there's
still
a
controversy
between
the
parties.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
and
i
think
under
this
particular
judgment,
the
secretary
is
--
is
now
bound
to
administer
all
the
statutes
within
i
to
making
sure
that
it
doesn't
invade
this
so-called
“quarters”
under
the
carey
act.
and
in
our
view
that's
a
--
that
--
you
know
that
is
an
impossible
narrowing
of
his
discretion
under
--
for
example
the
--
the
latest
federal
management
land
policy
act
of
1976
which
is
suppose
to
charge
the
secretary
with
putting
all
the
public
domain
to
the
best
possible
uses.
it
wouldn't
be
impossible
for
him
to
do
that
knowing
that
he
had
his
damocles
in
carey
act
sword
over
his
head
which
would
require
him
to
reserve
this
desert
land
for
--
for
the
eventuality.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
no,
but
11
--
that's
11
million
acres,
i
think,
across
the
board
without
all
this
through
--
throughout
all
the
states.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
--
i'm
not
really
sure
how
much
there
is
in
idaho.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
but
i
mean,
presumably,
even
if
there
is
lot
more
than
3
million
acres,
i
think,
if
the
secretary
would
allocate
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
but,
mr.
justice
stevens,
assuming,
you
know
--
if
the
--
if
the
secretary
would
allocate
lands
--
desert
lands
for
a
lot
of
other
purposes
under
--
under
a
variety
of
other
statutes,
he
would
still
have
to
make
sure
that
he
kept
at
least
3
million
acres.
and
you
know,
i've
--
we
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
--
you
know
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
i
think
that's
exactly
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
exactly
--
you
know,
i
can't
believe
the
point
but
i
think
--
i
think
that's
exactly
what
happened
there.
they
came
in
an
essence
of
land,
the
secretary
turned
them
down,
then
we
do
have
a
lawsuit.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
we
say,
we
--
we
turn
them
down
properly,
and
they
say
that
their
--
their
point
is
that
in
1894,
when
congress
pass
the
statute
that
they
had
a
--
they
had
a
--
a
right
to
the
code,
and
the
secretary
says
no.
because
--
in
fact,
while
there
are
host
of
statutes
now,
even
in
1894,
there
was
the
desert
land
act
of
1877.
and
the
secretary
presumably
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
problem
arose
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
problem
--
the
problem
is
before
the
court
really
because
of
the
technology.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
problem
--
the
problem
has
become
more
current
than
needs
resolution
because
the
--
because
the
deep
well
technology
has
made
irrigation
much
more
feasible.
i
mean,
there
haven't
been
any
carey
act
grants
since
the
1930s.
and
there
is
--
and
the
reason
was
because
most
of
the
desert
land
that
existed
--
existed,
you
know,
it
was
there
and
it
was
unarguable.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
you
know,
there's
anything
more
to
say
on
the
case
of
conspiracy
point.
i
simply
want
to
say
that
our
argument
rest
on
three
prongs
which
we
think
convincingly
refute
that
the
district
court's
decision
--
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
incorrect.
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
discretion,
i
need
only
point
to
pages
2
to
5
of
the
petition
which
talks
about
authorizing
and
empowering
the
secretary
upon
proper
application.
it
talks
about
entering
into
a
contract
which
then
becomes
binding
upon
the
united
states.
the
statute
itself,
doesn't
talk
about
a
binding
right,
they
are
a
host
of
land
grant
statutes
that
give
absolute
grants.
this
is
not
one
of
those
statutes.
the
swamp
land
act
of
the
1850s
was
such
an
absolute
grant,
and
the
legislative
history
specifically
distinguished
that
kind
of
statute
from
this
kind
of
a
statute.
may
i
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
second
paragraph
on
page
3,
the
petition
talks
about
before
the
application
of
any
state
is
allowed.
the
clear
implication
of
that
language
is
that
an
application
of
a
state
may
not
be
allowed.
and
in
fact
in
1908,
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
interior
were
replete
with
statistics
indicating
that
many
applications
where
denied.
and
there's
any
question
that
--
that
the
people
realized
and
people
in
the
western
states
realized
that
applications
under
the
carey
act
could
be
and
were
being
denied
routinely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
--
i
think
that's
the
proper
standard.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
sort
of
--
you
know
where
the
secretary
is
being
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
don't
know
if
the
secretary
could
announce
that
he's
not
taking
any
applications
from
idaho.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
can
be,
but
under
a
kind
of
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
and
then
finally,
let
me
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
the
secretary
needn't
give
any
reason
but
i
think
that
our
reviewing
court
would
have
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
yes.i
think
the
implication
is
that
the
secretary,
you
know,
has
to
administer
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
present
plan
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
could
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
it
liquidates
the
carey
act.
i
think
the
secretary
is
--
is
required
by
instances
the
act
is
still
on
the
book.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
was
required
to
give
a
good
faith
--
good
faith
consideration
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
you
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
examine
the
panoply
of
all
the
statutes
of
the
secretary,
and
if
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
--
for
inferring
that
the
secretary
had
or
could
have
all
the
plans
for
the
development
of
the
--
of
this
--
of
this
land.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
there
is
an
administrative,
you
know
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
statute
pretty
much
requires
that,
because
the
statute
talks
about
the
concurrence
of
the
president.
i
think
we're
really
talking
about,
you
know,
a
--
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
comparable
to
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that's
the
--
i
think
that
the
implication
is
that
--
that
the
secretary
may
have
that
in
reserve.
but
i
don't
think
that
he
has
to
say
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
he
has
to
say
so.
it's
possible
that
he
--
he
could
say
so.
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
--
i
don't
think
the
act
requires
him
to
say
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
does
he
have
to
have
administrative
record?
yes,
there
is
an
administrative
record
in
this
case.
and
presumably
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
presumably
this
--
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
the
act?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
he
can
say
no,
but
there
is
an
administrative
record
and
i
think
that,
you
know,
during
the
administrative
proceedings,
the
secretary,
i
think,
you
know,
may
well
volunteer
reasons
as
to
why
--
as
to
why
a
particular
applications
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
i
think
he
could
do
it
without
--
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
would
depend.
i
--
i
don't
think
he
could
say,
“i
don't
feel
like
allotting
anything
under
the
carey
act.”
but
i
think
he
could
say,
“i
don't
want
to
make
this
--
grant
this
application
under
the
carey
act."
i
think
all
that
the
act
requires
him
to
do
is
to
get
a
good
faith,
you
know,
consideration
of
any
carey
act
application.
congress,
you
know,
in
--
in
1976
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
addressed
the
question
as
to
--
what?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
words
of
the
statute,
i
think
that's
what
they
--
i
think
that's
what
they
connote.
i
just
want
to
close
by
saying
that
i
think
that
the
--
the
consisted
administrative
interpretation
also
confirms
our
argument
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
has
discretion.
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
would
put
the
other
way,
that
congress
can
give
the
untrammeled
discretion
of
a
particular
individual
to
preserve
the
public
domain
for
the
best
purposes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
he
can
give
it
away
and
use
it
according
to
his
best
lights,
according
to
his
best
--
the
best
uses.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
and
--
and
the
--
