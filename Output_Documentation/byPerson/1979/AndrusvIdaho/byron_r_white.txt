if
we
just
make
a
judgment,
that
would
get
rid
of
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
--
do
you
think
the
district
court
held
that
if
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
--
that
if
the
secretary
has
withdrawn
and
put
to
other
federal
uses,
all
the
public
lands.
so,
there
is
not
--
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
3
million
is
left,
it's
all
been
withdrawn,
all
have
been
put
to
some
of
these
for
stock
driveways
or
something.
the
district
court
did
say
that
--
that
the
secretary
must
entertain
a
petition
for
reclassification,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
could
not
arbitrarily
deny
it.
but
he
didn't
--
the
district
court
didn't
hold
that
he
had
the
grant
of
reclassification.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
answer
your
to
my
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
answer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
yes,
the
district
court
did
hold
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
would
have
to
reclassify
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
withdraw
this
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
assured.
to
put
it
in
other
way,
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
claim
is
that
if
the
day
after
the
carey
act
was
passed,
idaho
came
in
and
asked
for
anything
whether
3
million
acres
or
not
or
even
if
it
said
it
was
ready
and
satisfied
all
the
conditions
that
the
secretary
has
discretion
to
say
no
to
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
need
to
reserve
anything,
no
matter
how
much
land
is
available.
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
if
that
is
your
position,
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
me
that
idaho
certainly
has
a
--
has
a
case
or
controversy
with
you.
is
this
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
this
to
view
the
government
expressed
idaho
in
the
administrative
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
--
so
idaho
said,
“we
should
really
get
this
settled.”
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
at
least
--
as
long
as
some
land
is
on
withdrawn,
at
least
as
long
as
there
are
some
available.
we
are
entitled
to
it.
and
you
say
--
you
say
absolutely
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
complete
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
--
in
--
even
if
you
shave
this
lawsuit
down
to
the
27,000
acres
that
the
--
that
--
that
idaho
identified,
as
i
understand
you,
the
district
court
held
that
in
that
effect
is
that
idaho
was
entitled
to
the
27,000
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
and
--
and
you
say
that
--
that
idaho
is
not
entitled
to
it
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
not
--
27,000
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
think
the
district
court
held
that
they're
entitled
at
least
to
the
27,000
acres?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
they're
not
--
not
because
you
had
already
set
it
aside
for
some
--
for
some
stock
purposes
but
because
you
just
have
complete
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
--
so,
the
27,000
acre
issue
involves
the
very
issue
that
you
won't
decide
and
--
and
that
idaho
must
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
that
it
should
not
be
arbitrarily
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
--
and
your
--
your
issue
with
the
district
court
is
that
--
that
you
shouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
--
you
shouldn't
be
subject
to
any
petition
for
reclassification.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
would
subject
to
further
procedure
--
procedures
with
you
say
you
shouldn't
be
subjected.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
but
you
say
that
--
i
get
it
--
i
get
to
--
i
get
from
you
that
the
secretary
needn't
give
any
reason
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
deny.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
even
claim
that
the
land
is
presently
been
withdrawn
for
some
other
use
or
that
the
--
or
that
the
united
states
has
any
plans
for
its
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
doesn't
that
just
--
that
certainly
doesn't
--
that
certainly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
liquidates
the
carey
act
without
much
trouble.
you
entertained
the
petition
and
this
--
you
--
you
take
the
petition,
you
just
shrug
your
shoulders
and
say,
“sorry
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
sorry,
idaho
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
required
to
read
the
petition.
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
--
but
he
--
he
didn't
give
any
reason
for
denying.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
we
have
to
do
that?
why
shouldn't
the
secretary
have
to
do
it?
and
is
it
in
his
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
all
you
say
yesterday
give
us
the
bottom
line
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
even
discuss
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
he
--
he
needn't
even
say,
well,
we
think
maybe
perhaps
in
100
years,
we
would
like
to
lease
this
land
out
for
minimum
development
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
doesn't
he
--
why
shouldn't
he
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
discovered
some
--
apparently
they
have
some
deeper
aquifers
in
--
in
idaho
that
they
want
to
tap.
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
merits
of
this
question,
are
you
--
do
you
claim
that
you
should
--
that
that
reclassification
must
be
granted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
this
27,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
you
deny
then
that
a
withdrawal
by
the
secretary
for
another
use
for
the
united
states
is
enough
to
defeat
a
carey
act
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
his
claim
was
"well,
you
don't
get
this
land
because
we've
already
withdrawn
it
for
some
other
purpose,"
and
that's
enough
of
a
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well,
then,
suppose
the
secretary
had
withdrawn
for
stock
purposes
or
for
all
sorts
of
things
all
but
2
million
acres
of
the
public
land
in
idaho
and
then
idaho
came
in
and
made
a
--
and
made
a
present
claim
for
3
million
acres.
and
suppose
that
all
of
those
--
all
the
withdrawals
had
been
authorized
by
statute
and
where
as
fair
as
this
withdrawal
was
supposedly.
i
--
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
--
i
take
it
you
would
concede
that
idaho
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
its
full
3
million
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
i
--
i
took
it
--
i
take
from
what
mr.
--
if
i
--
if
i
didn't
misunderstand
mr.
smith,
he
said
part
of
this
27,000
acres
had
been
withdrawn
for
stock-driving
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
all
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
the
state
would
have
the
--
would
have
the
right
to
have
--
set
aside
for
carey
act
purposes,
lands
that
had
been
withdrawn
for
oil
shale
development?
for
leasing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
secretary
--
how
about
idaho's
claim?
would
--
would
the
carey
act
claim
override
into
such
withdrawal
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
adjust
to
--
you
--
you
at
least
have
the
--
the
right
to
--
to
have
it
shown
that
the
withdrawal
was
regular
and
authorized
by
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
require
--
that's
not
--
that's
inconsistent
with
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
his
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
his
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
arises
under
the
carey
act
which
is
an
old
statute
passed
in
1894
and
which
authorizes
the
secretary
of
interior
to
grant
to
specified
western
states
rather
large
acreages
of
desert
land
forming
part
of
the
public
domain
provided
that
the
state
agrees
to
--
to
reclaim
and
irrigate
the
land
and
provided
the
state
lives
up
to
its
--
to
its
promise.
the
secretary
was
later
authorized
to
temporarily
withdraw
land
pending
preparation
and
approval
of
a
development
plan.
this
case
arose
when
idaho
asked
the
secretary
to
set
aside
some
27,000
acres
of
desert
land
in
that
--
in
that
state
most
of
which,
however,
had
already
been
withdrawn
by
the
secretary
for
other
public
uses.
the
state
claimed
that
its
carey
act
request
the
carey
priority
and
it
was
absolutely
entitled
with
it
to
the
land
regardless
of
what
other
uses
were
being
made
of
it.
the
secretary
turned
down
the
request
indicating
that
he
claimed
complete
discretion
to
reject
such
request
and
that
the
state
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
any
specific
amount
of
land.
the
state
sued
in
the
district
court
and
although
ultimately
agreeing
with
the
secretary
that
this
particular
request
could
be
turned
down
the
district
court
held
that
the
states
did
have
a
right
to
the
statutory
acreage
which
the
secretary
would
have
to
reserve
and
not
commit
to
other
public
purposes.
the
court
also
indicated
that
--
that
the
secretary's
carey
act
decisions
were
subject
to
judicial
review
and
would
be
set
aside
as
they
were
arbitrary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
we
disagree
with
the
courts
below
that
--
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
a
particular
amount
of
land
at
the
--
that
the
secretary
must
reserve
from
the
public
--
from
the
public
domain.
we
state
our
reasons
at
some
length
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
court.
we
did
not
disturb,
however,
the
judgment
that
the
secretary's
carey
act
decisions
are
subject
to
judicial
review
on
the
grounds
of
arbitrariness.
so,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
