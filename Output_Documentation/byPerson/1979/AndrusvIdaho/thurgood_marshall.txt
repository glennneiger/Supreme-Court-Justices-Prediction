or
can
he
--
can
he
just
say
no
without
an
administrative
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can't
--
he
couldn't
done
without
an
--
justice

marshall
(voice

that
congress
can
give
to
one
person
the
untrammeled,
uncontrolled
discretion
to
give
away
my
land,
without
giving
any
reason
for
it.

or
he
can
give
it
away.
justice
thurgood

mr.
attorney
general,
exactly
what
did
the
government
deprive
idaho
as
of
now,
1895,
as
of
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
deny
you
the
right
to
file
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
it
doesn't
mean
they
won't
do
it
tomorrow,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
--
but
once
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
they
denied
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
denied
you
access
to
the
inner
circle,
you
mean?they
wouldn't
let
you
talk
to
the
secretary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
resulted
in
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
have
applied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
they
did,
they
denied
you
the
right
to
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not.
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
do
you
recognize
or
do
you
agree
with
me
that
it
has
a
completely
unconstitutional
statute
on
the
books?
and
it
applies
to
you
and
the
statute
says
that
the
secretary
of
interior
can
either
give
you
$1
million
or
no,
nothing,
and
you
have
no
redress
from
his
action.
do
you
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
because
he
might
give
it
to
you.
isn't
that
the
answer?
he
might
give
you
the
million.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
possible
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
could
rule
with
you
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
prevents
you
from
doing
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you've
been
denied
the
right
to
land,
which
you
otherwise
are
entitled
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
all
these
explanations.
i'm
interested
in
what
factually
injured
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
don't
have
this
with
the
human
land,
to
use
as
you
please.
