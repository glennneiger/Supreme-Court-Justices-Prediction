justice
byron
r.
white
what
reason
did
the
justice
have
for
saying
that,
though?
what
reason
did
he
give?
justice
byron
r.
white
also
his
statements
could
be
used
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
said
in
this
case
that
his
statements
couldn't
be
used
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
isn't
pleading
guilty
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
guilty,
he
says
i
didn't
have
possession.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
automatic
standing
rule
means
that
a
defendant
wins
the
motion
to
suppress
even
though
his
own
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
person
is
accused
of
the
possession
of
stolen
goods
and
the
officers
retrieved
the
stolen
goods
by
breaking
into
a
house
without
a
warrant
and
seizing
the
goods,
but
the
house
didn't
belong
to
the
defendant
and
the
defendant
didn't
claim
any
interest
in
the
premises,
he
moves
to
suppress.
well,
i
guess
under
your
approach
he
would
have
standing
to
raise
it
but
he
would
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was
accused
in
the
indictment
of
stolen
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so
you
would
say
then
he
should
win
his
suppression
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
standing
rule
means
that
he
can
win
the
suppression
motion
even
though
the
goods
were
seized
in
somebody
else's
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
in
a
case
like
this,
how
does
a
motion
to
suppress
proceed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
defendant
ever
take
the
stand
at
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
jones,
if
the
jones
case
had
involved
facts
like
these,
the
court
would
ever
have
decided
it
the
way
it
did,
where
the
defendant
wasn't
going
to
say
a
thing
or
ever
admit
a
thing,
just
on
the
four
corners
of
a
--
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
occasion
to
say
anything
like
what
they
said
in
jones,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
danger
that
jones
averted
to
was
something
the
defendant
might
say
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
might
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
here
you
make
the
motion
and
say
the
warrant
was
deficient.
he
doesn't
testify,
and
nothing
can
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
do
you
think
jones
would
ever
have
set
automatic
standing
in
a
situation
like
that?
i
would
have
thought
they
would
have
said
this
affidavit-warrant
doesn't
relate
to
any
property
that
--
it
relates
to
your
mother's
property
or
your
brother's
property
or
your
friend's
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
plenty
of
cases
that
say
that
if
the
officers
are
lawfully
where
they
are
when
they
find
the
evidence
of
crime,
they
can
seize
it.
what
if
they
had
found
whatever
was
seized
here
in
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
there
are
cases
that
say
that
if
the
officers
are
lawfully
where
they
are
supposed
to
be,
they
can
--
for
example,
if
they
are
lawfully
on
the
premises,
they
can
seize
items
that
they
see
in
plain
sight,
even
though
they
are
not
listed
in
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
certainly
here
if
the
warrant
had
been
good,
the
fact
that
you
had
an
interest,
even
if
you
owned
the
property
that
was
seized,
you
couldn't
have
objected
to
it,
to
the
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
say
if
the
warrant
was
good,
say
the
warrant
was
good,
it
was
a
good
warrant,
nothing
wrong
with
the
warrant.
the
officers
were
lawfully
in
the
house
and
lawfully
making
a
search
and
they
ran
across
this
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
lose
it,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
jones
doesn't
rest
upon
any
notion
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
concededly,
they
might
be
somebody
else's,
but
he
nevertheless
has
standing
to
get
suppression
based
on
the
violation
of
somebody
else's
fourth
amendment
rights
in
order
to
avoid
a
dilemma,
under
jones.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
another
branch
of
jones.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
another
branch
of
jones.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
suppose
in
this
case
where
the
warrant
was
presented,
the
motion
was
made
to
suppress,
the
warrant
was
presented
and
the
government
said
to
the
judge,
"judge,
we
have
evidence
to
show
you
that
this
defendant
had
no
interest
whatsoever
in
this
house,"
and
you
put
on
evidence
to
show
absolutely
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
house.
he
wasn't
a
guest,
he
didn't
own
it,
had
no
property
interest
--
why
should
there
be
automatic
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
under
jones
would
there
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
account
of
how
the
government
might
want
to
say,
well,
he
made
a
motion
to
suppress
which
in
itself
is
an
assertion
of
property
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
of
that
which
the
dissent
in
rakas
focused
on,
there
is
no
privacy
claim
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
the
automatic
standing
part
of
jones?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
majority
in
rakas,
unlike
the
dissenters,
attach
significance
to
the
absence
of
a
property
interest
in
the
automobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
doesn't
the
majority
actually
cut
more
against
you
than
the
dissent
does
in
the
rakas
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
extent
that
you
contend
that
a
property
interest
in
the
property
is
irrelevant.
there
is
language
in
the
majority
opinion
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
it
ever
be
relevant
to
the
legality
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
which
is
caused
by
an
improper
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
another
case,
you
know,
that
deals
with
the
problem.
