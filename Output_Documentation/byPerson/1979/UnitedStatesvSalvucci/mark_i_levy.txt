mr.
mark
i.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
respondents
were
charged
in
a
12-count
indictment
with
unlawful
possession
of
stolen
mail.
the
indictment
was
based
on
twelve
checks
that
had
been
stolen
from
the
united
states
mails
and
that
were
determined
to
bear
respondents'
fingerprints.
these
checks,
along
with
more
than
700
other
stolen
checks,
were
seized
by
massachusetts
state
police
officers
during
their
search
pursuant
to
a
state
warrant
of
an
apartment
rented
by
respondent
zackular's
mother.
the
indictment
alleged
that
respondents
unlawfully
possessed
this
stolen
mail
from
late
1975
to
on
or
about
december
17,
1976,
the
date
on
which
the
search
occurred.
prior
to
trial,
the
respondents
moved
to
suppress
the
checks
because
the
affidavit
submitted
in
support
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
failed
to
show
probable
cause.
the
district
court
granted
their
motion
and
ordered
suppression.
the
government
then
sought
reconsideration
of
the
suppression
order
on
the
ground
that
the
respondents
lacked
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
mother's
apartment.
the
government's
motion
for
reconsideration
argued
that
respondents
had
neither
a
sufficient
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
a
property
seized
or
premises
searched
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
search,
nor
automatic
standing
under
jones
v.
united
states.
the
respondents
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
this
motion
in
which
they
relied
solely
on
a
claim
of
automatic
standing.
following
submission
of
the
government's
memorandum,
the
district
court
by
a
handwritten
notation
on
the
face
of
the
government's
motion
reaffirmed
the
suppression
order.
on
the
government's
appeal,
the
first
circuit
affirmed.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
standing,
it
found
that
the
respondents
had
no
actual
standing
to
contest
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
because
they
had
not
established
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises
searched
or
the
property
seized
or
claimed
the
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
the
premises
or
the
checks.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
the
respondents
could
challenge
the
search
based
on
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
jones.
although
it
recognized
that
this
court
had
questioned
the
continued
vitality
of
the
automatic
standing
doctrine
and
that
there
was
a
split
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts
on
the
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
obligated
to
adhere
to
the
jones
rule
until
this
court
resolved
the
matter.
we
submit
that
the
jones
automatic
standing
rule
should
now
be
overturned.
under
jones,
a
defendant
automatically
has
standing
to
contest
a
search
that
leads
to
the
seizure
of
evidence
where
possession
of
the
seized
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
search
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
automatic
standing
turns
solely
on
the
nature
of
the
charge
brought
by
the
prosecutor
and
it
enables
a
defendant
to
obtain
the
suppression
of
reliable
and
probative
evidence
even
though
his
own
constitutional
rights
were
not
implicated
in
the
search.
in
this
way,
automatic
standing
is
inconsistent
with
the
well
settled
principle
that
the
exclusionary
rule
can
be
invoked
only
by
a
defendant
who
has
demonstrated
that
his
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated.
the
court
in
jones
found
that
cases
involving
possessory
offenses
presented
a
special
problem
that
for
two
reasons
warranted
departure
from
the
conventional
principles
of
standing.
first
was
the
self-incrimination
dilemma
in
which
the
defendant
was
confronted
with
either
foregoing
the
assertion
of
his
fourth
amendment
claim
or,
in
order
to
establish
standing,
giving
incriminating
testimony
as
an
admission
could
be
used
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
to
prove
his
guilt
at
trial.
as
this
court
observed
in
brown
v.
united
states,
this
self-incrimination
dilemma
can
no
longer
occur
in
light
of
the
subsequent
decision
in
simmons
v.
united
states
that
a
defendant's
testimony
at
a
suppression
hearing
cannot
be
introduced
as
part
of
the
prosecutor's
direct
case
at
trial.
we
believe
that
brown
correctly
concluded
that
the
self-incrimination
dilemma
is
no
longer
an
issue
after
simmons.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
not.
the
respondents
were
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
they
have
never
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding
asserted
that
they
had
any
basis
for
actual
standing.
indeed,
respondent
zackular
in
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
i
think
expressly
concedes
that
they
have
no
actual
standing,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
the
claim
of
actual
standing.
hence,
as
the
court
recognized
in
brown,
the
continued
validity
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
rests
solely
on
the
second
rationale
in
jones,
the
so-called
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
whereby
the
government
alleges
the
defendants'
possession
as
an
essential
element
of
the
defense
charge
but
denies
that
there
was
possession
sufficient
to
establish
the
defendants'
standing
to
contest
the
search.
in
our
view,
the
automatic
standing
rule
cannot
be
justified
on
this
ground.
it
is
not
inherently
contradictory
for
the
government
to
charge
a
defendant
with
a
possessory
offense
based
on
his
culpable
conduct
prescribed
by
the
penal
code
and
at
the
same
time
to
contend
that
he
had
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
that
was
implicated
by
the
search
that
uncovered
the
illegally
possessed
items.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
the
holding
of
jones
is
that
the
government
is
foreclosed
from
contesting
the
suppression
motion
on
the
ground
that
the
defendant
didn't
have
standing
to
raise
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
don't
believe
that
it
does.
this
is
most
clearly
illustrated
in
cases
where
the
defendant
is
charged
not
with
actual
possession
at
the
time
of
the
search
but
rather
is
charged
with
constructive
or
vicarious
possession.
for
example,
a
defendant
who
exercises
dominion
or
control
over
contraband,
even
though
it
is
not
in
his
actual
possession,
has
engaged
in
conduct
that
the
criminal
law
rightly
condemns
and
he
is
subject
to
prosecution
for
a
possessory
offense
under
a
theory
of
constructive
possession,
but
that
fact
standing
alone
is
not
tantamount
to
a
concession
by
the
government
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
affected
by
the
search
of
a
third
party's
premises
or
property
in
which
he
had
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
for
example,
consider
a
defendant
who
without
permission
conceals
contraband
narcotics
on
the
property
of
a
stranger
with
the
intention
later
to
reclaim
the
drugs
and
sell
them.
if
the
police
illegally
enter
and
search
the
third
party's
property
and
seize
the
narcotics,
it
can
hardly
be
thought
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
infringed
for
he
had
no
reasonable
privacy
interest
in
the
place
that
was
illegally
searched.
in
these
circumstances,
it
would
be
fully
proper
for
the
government
to
charge
the
defendant
with
unlawful
possession
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
yet
object
to
his
standing
to
seek
the
suppression
of
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
illegal
search.
another
example
suggested
by
the
decision
in
rakas
v.
illinois
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
by
the
illegal
search
of
the
car
in
which
they
were
riding.
the
defendants
in
rakas
were
charged
with
armed
robbery.
if,
however,
they
had
been
prosecuted
and
convicted
with
the
unlawful
constructive
possession
of
the
rifle
that
was
found
during
the
course
of
the
search,
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
their
suppression
claim
would
be
enhanced
in
the
slightest
or
that
the
government
would
be
acting
in
a
contradictory
fashion
by
prosecuting
on
that
charge
while
denying
that
the
defendants
could
challenge
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
we
think
if
he
had
standing
at
all
it
would
not
be
under
the
theory
of
automatic
standing.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
he
could
establish
that
the
checks
were
his
and
that
they
were
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
he
would
file
a
motion
under
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
return
of
property.
he
would
need
to
establish
more
than
simply
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
agree.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
do
not
believe
so.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
distinct
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
one
is
against
unreasonable
searches
and
the
other
is
against
unreasonable
seizures.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
have
a
secondary
argument
that
relies
on
the
contraband
character,
that
if
this
court
contrary
to
our
argument
should
conclude
that
the
defendants'
legitimate
interest
in
the
property
seized
does
entitle
him
to
challenge
the
search,
then
that
rule
would
be
inapplicable
where
the
defendant
was
in
possession
of
contraband
material
such
as
narcotics
or
stolen
goods.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
we
do
not
think
that
would
give
him
standing
to
challenge
the
search.
it
might
give
him
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure
if
he
alleged
there
was
something
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
or
he
might
be
able
to
seek
suppression
at
trial
on
the
basis
that
the
seizure
rather
than
the
search
was
unlawful
if
he
had
a
ground
for
challenging
the
seizure
of
the
gun
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
stevens.
but
we
think
that
is
a
distinct
matter
from
his
ability
to
challenge
the
search
that
led
to
the
seizure
of
the
gun.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
if
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
there
may
be
some
basis
on
which
a
seizure
itself
could
be
challenged.
for
example,
if
the
incriminating
nature
of
the
evidence
were
not
immediately
apparent
under
a
plain
view
doctrine,
for
example
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
or
if
the
police
were
entitled
to
seize
something
temporarily
as
a
means
of
protection
but
they
retained
the
item
longer
than
was
necessary,
there
might
be
some
grounds
for
challenging
the
seizure
itself
apart
from
the
search
that
led
to
the
seizure.
one
way
to
see
we
think
the
absence
of
any
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
in
the
automatic
standing
situations
is
to
ask
whether
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
pursue
applicable
remedies
other
than
the
exclusionary
rule
such
as
a
damage
action
for
the
assertedly
unconstitutional
search.
we
think
it
plain
that
in
the
hypotheticals
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
awarded
monetary
damages
since
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
by
the
illegal
search.
for
the
same
reason,
he
should
not
be
able
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule
remedy,
and
that
conclusion
is
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
brought
against
him.
thus,
we
think
that
the
jones
rationale
or
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
does
not
support
the
continuation
of
the
automatic
standing
rule.
apart
from
the
two
rationales
of
jones
itself,
the
respondent,
salvucci,
contends
in
his
brief
that
the
automatic
standing
rule
can
be
justified
by
reference
to
principles
of
actual
standing.
salvucci
argues
that
a
defendant's
possessory
interest
in
contraband
that
is
seized
entitles
him
without
more
to
seek
suppression
of
that
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
underlying
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
salvucci
then
argues
that
the
charging
of
a
possessory
offense
necessarily
constitutes
an
admission
by
the
government
that
the
defendant
has
the
requisite
possessory
interest
in
the
seized
contraband
to
enable
him
to
challenge
the
search
and
therefore
that
the
automatic
standing
rule
should
be
retained
to
avoid
the
needless
formality
of
an
inquiry
into
standing
at
the
suppression
hearing.
we
submit
that
this
line
of
argument
is
entirely
unsound.
in
our
view,
as
i
just
discussed
with
mr.
justice
stevens,
a
defendant's
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
items
seized
does
not
in
and
of
itself
entitle
him
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
search.
moreover,
regardless
of
the
general
rule,
an
asserted
possessory
interest
in
contraband,
such
as
stolen
property,
is
totally
illegitimate
and
cannot
served
as
the
basis
for
a
fourth
amendment
challenge
to
either
a
search
or
a
seizure.
finally,
even
if
a
possessory
interest
in
contraband
could
suffice
to
confer
standing
with
respect
to
the
search,
the
automatic
standing
rule
still
would
not
be
warranted,
since
not
all
possessory
interests
should
be
considered
adequate
but
rather
only
those
interests
that
establish
a
sufficient
personal
nexus
between
the
seized
contraband
and
the
defendant.
first,
a
defendant's
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
the
items
seized
does
not
in
itself
entitle
him
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
search.
salvucci's
argument
to
the
contrary
reflects
a
misconception
of
the
fourth
amendment's
protections
against
unreasonable
searches
and
unreasonable
seizures.
a
search
is
defined
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
terms
of
a
governmental
intrusion
upon
a
person's
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
it
depends
not
on
a
property
right
but,
rather,
on
a
reasonable
privacy
interest.
a
seizure
of
a
physical
object,
on
the
other
hand,
is
defined
in
terms
of
a
governmental
interference
with
the
bundle
of
property
rights
that
attends
a
person's
interest
in
or
relation
to
that
object.
it
implicates
precisely
those
property
rights
that
a
person
has
by
virtue
of
his
ownership
or
possession
of
a
given
object.
under
this
analysis,
a
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
items
seized
could
give
rise
to
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
seizure,
since
it
was
the
act
of
seizure
that
dispossessed
the
defendant
of
his
property.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
would
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment
taking
problem.
i
don't
think
the
government
here
purported
to
seize
items
under
its
eminent
domain
power
or
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
items
that
they
found
to
be
unlawfully
seized.
the
government
here
is
not
asserting
that
as
items
seized
it
is
a
transfer
of
title
to
the
government
if
it
was
an
item
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
own,
but
rather
than
the
government
is
entitled
to
temporary
possession
for
use
of
the
item
in
the
criminal
proceeding
against
the
defendant.
i
think
it
is
a
different
problem
than
a
taking
issue
that
might
be
posed
in
other
circumstances.
the
defendant's
interest
in
his
property,
however,
even
if
allowing
him
to
challenge
the
seizure,
would
not
entitle
him
to
challenge
the
antecedent
search
of
a
third
party's
premises
in
which
by
hypothesis
the
defendant
has
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
nor
can
standing
be
based
on
the
proposition
that
a
defendant
has
a
cognizable
privacy
interest
in
a
place
simply
because
his
property
is
kept
there.
we
acknowledge
that
in
some
circumstances
a
defendant
who
stores
his
property
in
the
premises
of
a
third
party
may
have
a
sufficient
privacy
interest
in
those
premises
to
challenge
a
search.
on
the
other
hand,
not
all
such
uses
of
a
third
party's
premises
would
demonstrate
a
privacy
interest.
for
instance,
if
the
defendant
illegally
entered
someone's
home
and
without
the
knowledge
or
permission
of
the
owner
concealed
incriminating
evidence
in
the
basement,
he
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
that
his
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
was
infringed
if
the
police
unlawfully
search
the
basement
for
that
evidence.
likewise,
if
the
defendant
simply
asks
a
third
party
briefly
to
keep
something
for
him,
without
any
understanding
as
to
the
particular
location
of
where
it
would
be
kept
or
the
need
for
it
to
be
securely
and
privately
stored,
then
we
doubt
that
the
defendant
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
place
where
the
third
party
eventually
decides
to
put
the
object.
in
these
cases,
the
pertinent
inquiry
is
not
whether
the
defendant
had
a
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
the
items
that
were
seized
but
whether
taking
into
account
all
relevant
considerations,
including
his
use
of
the
area
to
store
his
belongings,
the
defendant
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
area
searched.
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
property
was
legitimately
on
the
third
party's
premises
does
not
by
itself
give
him
a
privacy
interest
in
those
premises,
just
as
in
rakas
the
defendant's
legitimate
presence
in
the
car
that
was
searched
did
not
by
itself
entitle
him
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
search.
we
do
not
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
compel
different
analysis
than
the
government
presents
here.
in
particular,
we
do
not
read
united
states
v.
jeffers
to
be
a
contrary
holding.
we
believe
that
the
defendant's
standing
in
jeffers
was
based
on
his
interest
in
the
hotel
room
that
was
searched.
he
had
a
key
to
that
room,
he
had
permission
to
use
the
room
at
will,
and
in
fact
he
often
entered
for
various
purposes.
this
was
clearly
an
adequate
ground
on
which
to
find
standing,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court's
opinion
in
jeffers
is
best
understood
to
rest
on
a
possessory
interest
in
the
items
that
were
seized.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
hasn't
been
raised
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
court
rejected
it
in
rakas.
i
am
not
aware
of
whether
the
police
officers
at
the
time
they
conducted
this
search
were
subjectively
seeking
the
evidence
against
the
defendants
or
others.
i
think
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
no
claim
of
that
kind
here.
to
the
extent
that
standing
in
jeffers
was
based
on
the
property
that
was
seized,
which
we
think
is
not
the
best
reading
of
the
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
it
declined
to
separate
the
search
and
the
seizure
because,
in
the
court's
words,
they
were
bound
together
by
one
sole
purpose,
to
locate
and
seize
the
narcotics
of
the
respondent.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
conceivably
could
be
if
entry
is
made
to
search
for
incriminating
evidence
against
one
defendant
and
other
incriminating
evidence
against
the
second
defendant
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
the
court's
reliance
on
that
theory
is,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
just
suggested,
a
variant
of
the
target
theory
which
was
rejected
in
rakas.
we
think
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
declined
to
separate
the
search
and
the
seizure.
to
that
extent,
we
think
that
jeffers
has
already
been
discredited
by
rakas
and
doesn't
present
a
controlling
view
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
any
event,
to
the
extent
that
jeffers
rested
in
some
other
way
on
a
defendant's
interest
in
the
items
seized,
we
submit
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
subsequent
doctrine
that
clearly
distinguishes
between
an
unreasonable
search
and
an
unreasonable
seizure
and
therefore
it
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
controlling.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
just
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
we
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
situation
has
changed
since
jones.
at
that
time,
the
doctrine
of
standing
and
the
now
settled
limitation
of
standing
to
defendants
whose
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
was
not
yet
fully
developed
by
the
court.
secondly,
the
privacy
formulation
of
fourth
amendment
rights
exemplified
in
later
decisions,
such
as
katz,
alderman
and
rakas,
was
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
don't
believe
that
there
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
so,
as
long
as
the
defendant
were
simply
charged
with
the
possessory
offense,
where
possession
was
charged
at
the
time
of
the
search,
then
there
would
be
automatic
standing
under
jones.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
the
more
substantial
reasoning
of
jones
was
the
self-incrimination
dilemma
as
it
has
come
to
be
called,
and
that
was
eliminated
in
simmons.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
was
one
of
the
rationales
relied
on
in
jones,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
believe
it
is.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
motion
as
i
recall
was
very
brief
and
simply
alleged
that
the
warrant
was
invalid
on
its
face.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
would
be
inherent
as
part
of
the
filing
of
a
motion.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
as
part
of
the
prosecution's
direct
case
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
that
is
the
holding
in
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
believe
that
is
correct,
but
even
if
that
it
is
correct
it
does
not
reimpose
the
self-incrimination
dilemma
that
was
of
concern
to
the
court
in
jones.
i
also
note
that
at
the
time
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
it
is.
i
think
there
was
no
disagreement
on
the
court
about
the
test
to
be
applied.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
our
position
is
consistent
in
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
because
as
i
read
the
majority
opinion
in
rakas,
the
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
our
position
is
that
it
is
totally
irrelevant.
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
sufficient.
i
think
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
the
property
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
one
consideration
in
assessing
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
how
the
property
was
used.
to
the
extent
it
was
used
to
store
one's
possessions,
then
that
is
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
privacy
interest.
it
is
not
a
dispositive
factor,
but
i
think
it
is
one
factor
among
many
that
could
be
considered
by
the
court
in
evaluating
the
defendant's
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
read
the
rakas
majority
simply
to
leave
open
the
question
of
the
effect
of
a
property
interest
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
he
might
have
standing
in
that
case,
but
that
goes
to
a
different
property
interest.
that
is
the
property
interest
in
the
area
that
is
searched,
like
the
suitcase
in
arkansas
v.
sanders.
that
does
not
go
to
a
property
interest
in
the
items
that
are
seized,
and
that
is
the
basis
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
don't
think
that
rakas
goes
that
far.
but
in
any
event,
rakas
was
concerned
only
with
the
property
interest
in
the
area
that
was
searched.
i
think
that
is
an
entirely
different
question
than
a
property
interest
in
the
item
seized
as
a
basis
for
suppressing
the
evidence
obtained
during
the
search.
in
answer
to
your
question
before,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
only
one
case
of
which
i
am
aware,
united
states
v.
mazzelli,
from
the
ninth
circuit,
that
deals
with
the
question
of
a
possessory
interest
in
the
item
seized
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
challenging
--
that
holds
that
a
possessory
interest
in
the
item
seized
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
challenging
the
search.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
are
many
cases
that
deal
with
it,
including
your
opinion
in
united
states
v.
lisk.
mazzelli
is
the
only
one
of
which
i
am
aware
that
goes
the
other
way,
and
that
is
presently
pending
before
the
court
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
under
the
name
of
conway.
other
than
that,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
have
so
held.
we
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
the
arguments
that
we
present
in
our
reply
brief
are
applicable
not
only
to
the
automatic
standing
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case
but
are
also
fully
applicable
in
cases
where
the
defendant
claims
actual
standing.
in
particular,
we
believe
that
the
defendant
in
rawlings
v.
kentucky,
which
is
to
be
argued
in
tandem
with
the
instant
case
today,
does
not
have
actual
standing
simply
because
his
property
interest
in
the
items
that
were
seized
from
his
companion's
purse,
that
basis
by
itself
in
our
view
does
not
suffice
to
establish
his
fourth
amendment
standing
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief.
thank
you.
