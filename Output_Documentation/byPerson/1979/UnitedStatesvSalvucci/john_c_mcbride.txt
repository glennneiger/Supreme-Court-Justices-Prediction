mr.
john
c.
mcbride
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
facts
and
the
law
enunciated
in
rakas,
the
facts
and
the
law
enunciated
in
simmons
and
in
brown
do
not,
i
most
respectfully
suggest,
undercut
the
theory
that
we
are
advocating
today.
we,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
are
asking
the
court
to
uphold
the
decision,
the
stare
decisis
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
jones
v.
united
states.
in
rakas,
decided
in
december
1978
by
this
court,
the
court
was
confronted
with
defendants
charged
with
armed
robbery.
they
were
not
charged
with
unlawful
possession
of
the
shotguns
and
of
the
shotgun
shells
that
were
found
respectively
inside
the
glove
compartment
that
was
locked
and
inside
the
car,
underneath
the
front
seat
that
was
discovered
by
the
police.
i
submit
most
respectfully
that
there
might
have
been
a
different
result
if
they
were
charged
with
unlawful
possession
of
those
particular
items.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
certainly
think
he
did,
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
opinions
of
the
many
circuits
that
have
construed
jones
in
different
respects,
and
i
think
most
respectfully
it
is
time
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
cases
of
rakas,
simmons
and
brown.
i
submit
most
respectfully
that
those
three
cases
do
not
undercut
jones
v.
united
states.
jones
is
viable
now.
those
cases,
especially
the
rakas
case
is
limited
to
its
facts.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
because
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
limitation
of
the
facts,
namely
the
defendants
being
arrested
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery.
the
footnote
in
the
opinion
reserved
decision
on
that
because
of
the
different
array
of
decisions
in
the
federal
circuits
concerning
the
viability
of
jones.
and
i
think
this
case
gives
this
court
the
power
to
once
again
reaffirm
jones.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
agree
wholeheartedly,
your
honor,
but
the
point
that
has
not
been
raised
or
has
been
raised
but
not
directly
answered
by
my
brother
is
the
issue
of
the
prosecutorial
self-contradiction.
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
would
seem
to
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
at
one
point
in
time,
they
are
saying
that
defendant
zackular
does
not
have
standing
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
search
because
he
was
not
in
possession
or
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
at
his
mother's
house;
and
on
the
other
hand
they
are
saying
--
and
contradictory,
just
as
justice
frankfurter
had
pointed
out
in
jones,
that
on
the
other
hand
he
clearly
had
possession
enough
to
find
him
guilty
before
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
automatic
standing
protects
the
defendant,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
defendant,
especially
my
defendant,
mr.
zackular,
did
not
testify
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
because
i
felt
at
the
time,
in
reliance
upon
jones,
that
we
had
automatic
standing
to
assert
a
violation
of
our
rights.
i
did
not
want
mr.
zackular
to
make
a
statement
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
full
well
knowing
that
under
a
simmons
context
it
couldn't
be
used
against
him
substantively
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
but
in
light
of
jones
we
were
constricted
at
that
time
by
a
search
pursuant
to
a
warrant
that
was
governed
by
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit
in
the
search
warrant
at
that
time,
and
in
light
of
jones
i
felt
strongly
that
my
client
should
absolutely
exercise
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
not
say
anything
because
he
was
given
the
benefit
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
enunciated
by
judge
frankfurter
in
jones.
in
terms
of
speaking
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth,
if
you
advocate
the
prosecutor's
position,
in
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
then
the
prosecutor
would
have
my
client
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
testify
yes,
i
lived
with
my
mother,
or
yes
i
had
some
type
of
proprietary
or
possessory
interest
in
the
house
in
melrose
where
the
checks
were
found.
clearly,
if
he
testified
at
trial,
he
has
to
testify
consistently
with
this.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
but
he
has
got
the
right
to
testify
if
he
so
elects,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
but
the
dilemma
that
is
posed
against
him
at
this
particular
juncture
is
he,
if
you
advocate
the
government's
position,
would
have
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
and
purge
himself,
yes,
i
owned
those
particular
pieces
of
mail.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
an
automatic
standing
solves
the
dilemma,
your
honor.
what
it
does
is
it
allows
the
defendant
to
remain
silent
and
it
allows
the
defendant
to
assert
a
violation
of
a
fourth
amendment
right
by
remaining
silent
and
gaining
the
benefit
of
jones
and
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
a
motion
to
suppress,
to
determine
the
truth.
the
judge
at
this
juncture
doesn't
determine
truth,
as
you
well
know,
your
honor.
he
determines
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
has
been
violated.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
it
may
not
help
a
jury
but
the
automatic
standing
rule
is
not
for
the
jury
to
assess.
it
is
up
to
the
judge
at
pretrial
to
dispose
of
an
issue
and
determine
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
has
been
violated.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
agree,
your
honor,
especially
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
judge
frankfurter
said,
your
honor,
that
the
defendant
isn't
given
the
unjust
advantage
at
that
time,
the
prosecution
was
given
the
unjust
advantage
by
getting
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
they
should
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
best
of
both
worlds.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
are
not
in
an
alderman-type
situation
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
because
the
defendant
is
charged
with
a
possessory
crime
here,
unlike
the
situation
in
alderman
where
the
defendant
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
clearly.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
very
function,
i
submit,
of
a
motion
to
suppress
is
to
insure
and
make
sure
that
the
police
do
not
violate
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
trouble
with
your
question
because
you
say
that
a
motion
to
suppress
is
seeking
to
suppress
the
truth.
i
don't
say
for
a
minute
that
a
motion
to
suppress
is
used
to
suppress
the
truth.
i
say
that
it
is
being
used
to
suppress
constitutional
violations
of
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
it
certainly
could
be
relevant
and
material,
in
this
case
especially,
since
there
were
fingerprints
found,
latent
fingerprints
found
on
the
checks
that
were
discovered
at
the
mother's
house.
it
certainly
could
be
probative
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence,
but
that
is
for
a
jury
to
assess,
not
a
judge
at
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
your
honor,
which
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
clearly.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
he
is
not
making
a
judgment
about
the
case.
in
this
case
he
is
deciding
that
the
government
does
not
have
any
evidence
to
use
against
the
defendant
because
the
only
evidence
that
the
state
police
had
at
that
time
were
the
checks
taken
from
zackular's
mother's
house
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
there
were
a
multitude
of
checks,
your
honor,
some
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
yes,
several
hundred,
i
believe,
and
there
were
some
that
had
latent
fingerprints
of
the
defendant
on
the
checks,
but
mr.
zackular's
mother
was
arrested
also,
and
i
submit
that
clearly
judge
garrity
was
correct
at
the
motion
stage
in
ruling
that,
number
one,
the
search
warrant
was
invalid,
and
there
is
no
question
about
that;
and,
number
two,
that
the
defendants,
mr.
zackular
and
mr.
salvucci,
had
standing
to
assert
a
violation
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
it
may
have
been
done
vicariously.
the
search
may
have
violated
mrs.
zackular's
rights
to
her
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
but
the
very
nature
of
the
charge,
i.e.,
unlawful
possession
of
checks
stolen
from
the
mail,
most
respectfully
confers
automatic
standing
on
the
defendants
to
assert
a
violation
of
his
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
when
we
were
up
before
judge
garrity
in
boston,
your
honor,
the
judge
was
bound
to
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
and
we
went
before
judge
garrity
and
the
judge
was
bound
by
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit.
at
the
very
motion
to
suppress,
nothing
was
brought
up
concerning
the
defendant's
standing
to
assert
a
violation
of
the
motion
to
suppress.
there
was
argument
made
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
no,
sir.
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendants
simply
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
and
produced
the
affiant,
trooper
bellanti,
who
testified
to
certain
facts,
but
basically
judge
garrity
found,
as
you
can
see
from
a
reading
of
the
appendix,
that
the
affidavit
did
not
contain
probable
cause.
and
only
after,
at
a
later
did,
approximately
three
to
four
weeks
later
did
the
government
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
that
is
because
jones
was
limited
to
its
expressed
facts,
namely
mr.
jones
being
present
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
again,
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
jones
was
limited
to
the
case
where
a
person
on
the
premises,
as
long
as
he
was
reasonably
on
the
premises,
had
a
right
to
assert
a
motion
to
suppress.
rakas,
of
course,
the
test
in
rakas
is
whether
you
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
particular
case
as
passengers
in
an
automobile.
here
we
are
in
a
different
position
because
the
crime
charged
is
a
different
crime.
it
is
possession,
your
honor.
again,
the
vice
that
this
court
can
protect
against
is
the
vice
of
prosecutorial
self-contradiction,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
that
to
overturn
jones
would
be
to
give
the
government
the
best
of
both
worlds
in
saying
on
the
one
hand
that
mr.
zackular
has
no
standing
because
he
has
not
shown
any
possessory
interest,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
say
that
he
is
guilty
of
unlawful
possession
of
checks
found
at
his
mother's
house.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
i
submit
--
i
disagree
with
that
one-hundred
percent.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
for
me,
your
honor,
is
united
states
v.
chadwick,
where
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
there
is
another
case
that
i
can't
put
my
hand
on
now,
your
honor,
where
a
fellow
was
in
a
cab
and
had
a
suitcase
with
drugs
in
it
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
arkansas
v.
sanders
--
and
he
could
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
agree,
your
honor,
as
long
as
they
are
evidence
of
contraband
or
crime,
and
possibly
under
warden
v.
hayden
mere
evidence
of
a
crime,
but
this
isn't
that
type
of
case.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
if
mr.
zackular
owned
the
house
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
would
still
submit,
your
honor,
i
have
grounds
to
submit
a
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
--
based
on
the
very
nature
of
the
charge.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
my
answer
is
in
the
affirmative.
i
certainly
do
have
standing
because
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
well,
i
can't
give
you
a
case
on
point
other
than
the
previous
stare
decisis
of
jones
v.
united
states,
your
honor,
which
i
am
asking
the
court
to
uphold.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
fourth
amendment
right
is
his
right
under
jones
--
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
under
rakas,
your
honor,
he
clearly
would
have
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
mother's
home,
and
that
is
the
test
that
was
advocated
in
rakas
v.
illinois.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
the
fourth
amendment
right
is
the
right
of
a
person
like
mr.
zackular
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
in
a
crime
where
he
is
charged
with
possession,
which
is
the
particular
case
here.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
only
because
he
was
lawfully
on
the
premises
and
had
access
to
the
premises
at
that
particular
time,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
i
agree.
mr.
john
c.
mcbride
the
fact
that
still
sticks
out
in
jones
is
the
protection
against
the
prosecutorial
self-contradiction
and
with
that
argument
in
mind
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
on
the
motion
to
suppress
by
judge
garrity
and
to
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
boston.
thank
you.
