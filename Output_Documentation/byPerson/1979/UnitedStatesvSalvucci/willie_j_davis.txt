mr.
willie
j.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
twenty
years
ago,
when
this
court
decided
jones,
it
did
so
on
two
very
distinct
grounds
which
we
contend
have
not
been
changed
since
that
time.
as
far
as
the
vice
of
prosecutorial
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
and
most
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
solicitor
general
in
seeking
cert
in
this
case
did
not
involve
a
situation
where
possession
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
and
it
is
our
decision
in
presenting
the
matter
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
should
separate
the
two
types
of
crimes,
that
is,
one
we
call
the
possessory
crime,
and
one
a
non-possessory
crime.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
decision
of
any
court
where
they
rely
on
the
invasion
of
one's
own
privacy
to
establish
standing
where
the
crime
is
non-possessory.
but
we
submit
that
justice
frankfurter
was
absolutely
correct
when
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
in
jones,
that
where
you
have
this
possessory
crime,
that
this
ought
to
set
it
apart,
it
ought
to
be
separate
and
distinct.
now,
if
we
chose
not
to
--
mr.
willie
j.
davis
because
the
government
would
be
allowed
to
talk
out
of
both
sides
of
its
mouth
in
a
possessory
crime.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
we
say
that
simmons
does
not
overrule
jones
in
this
respect.
we
submit
that
simmons
only
applied
to
non-possessory
crimes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
in
simmons
explicitly
said
that.
they
explicitly
said
that
they
resolved
the
problem
of
possessory
crimes
with
jones,
and
now
we
go
on
to
the
non-possessory
crimes
--
mr.
willie
j.
davis
well,
i
still
say
it
is
not
enough.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
it
is
not
enough
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
he
were
to
take
the
stand
at
a
motion
to
suppress
and
to
admit
having
possession,
then
it
would
lead
the
prosecution
perhaps
to
some
evidence
that
he
could
use
in
his
direct
case
without
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
coming
in
at
the
trial.
for
example,
what
if
the
prosecutor
asked
the
defendant
at
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
where
did
you
get
the
stolen
checks,
and
the
defendant
said
i
got
them
from
sam
jones.
the
government
now
has
a
lead.
they
can
go
talk
to
sam
jones
and
indeed
perhaps
present
sam
jones
in
their
direct
case
in
anticipation
of
a
defense
presented
by
the
defendant.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
sure
it
is.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
the
defendant
is
what?
mr.
willie
j.
davis
oh,
no,
he
would
not.
no,
he
would
not.
the
defendant
would
take
the
stand
at
a
motion
to
suppress
and
say,
yes,
i
did
have
possession
of
them.
that
is
not
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth.
he
is
admitting
it,
and
i
am
saying
that
his
admission
could
later
be
held
against
him.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
no,
he
is
not
pleading
guilty
but
he
--
mr.
willie
j.
davis
if
he
took
the
stand
and
said
i
didn't
have
possession,
that
is
entirely
another
matter.
we
don't
say
that
he
has
a
right
to
take
the
stand
at
any
hearing
and
lie.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
it
does,
and
he
simply
says
by
that
i
did
not
commit
the
crime
as
charged,
and
this
crime
has,
as
all
of
the
proof,
more
than
the
element
of
possession.
you
go
further,
the
element
of
possession
with
knowledge
that
the
checks
were
stolen.
now,
he
could
certainly
admit
at
a
motion
to
suppress
that
he
had
possession
of
the
checks
and
then
go
on
to
say,
yes,
but
i
had
no
criminal
intent
because
i
didn't
know
they
were
stolen,
i
received
them
from
sam
jones
who
said
to
me,
hey,
take
a
look
at
what
i
have
here,
hold
this
for
me,
or
anything
like
that.
that
is
not
and
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
the
particular
statute
because
he
didn't
possess
it
knowing
the
checks
had
been
stolen.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
yes.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
oh,
it
is
not
wrong.
it
is
not
wrong.
it
just
gives
the
government
more
ammunition
than
they
had
before.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
i
am
not
speaking
of
impressible.
i
agree
that
it
is
proper.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
defendants
do
it
themselves
at
a
motion
to
suppress.
how
often
do
they
use
it
as
a
forum
for
discovery,
trying
to
get
as
much
of
the
government's
case
as
they
can.
i
am
saying
now
that
the
government
would
be
allowed
to
explore
the
defendant's
case
at
a
motion
to
suppress
and
tighten
its
case
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
because
they
got
it
initially
by
illegal
means.
and
if
you
say
that
they
got
it
by
illegal
or
unlawful
means,
the
defendant
has
no
way
to
combat
it.
he
has
no
way
to
combat
it.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
the
whole
of
a
motion
to
suppress,
that
his
personal
rights
were
violated.
that
is
why
we
asserted
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
jones
in
response
to
the
government's
subsequent
motion
to
reconsider
the
denial
--
mr.
willie
j.
davis
it
doesn't
mean
that
at
all.
it
simply
means
that
he
has
standing
to
say
that
the
search
was
unlawful,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
search
was.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
he
had
automatic
standing
under
those
conditions
unless
possession
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
all
right,
possession
of
stolen
property.
all
right,
possession
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime,
so
i
think
that
that
in
and
of
itself
gives
his
automatic
standing
because
the
government
has
said
he
possessed
it.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
yes,
on
your
theory,
because
the
search
was
positively
unlawful.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
it's
only
right
under
jones.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
read
them
as
questioning
the
automatic
standing
rule
because
all
of
those
cases
did
not
apply
to
a
crime
where
possession
was
an
essential
element
and
we
have
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
well,
you
said
it
was
up
in
the
air
and
i
believe
because
of
all
of
the
decisions
from
the
circuits
emanating
after
simmons.
that
is
why
i
think
maybe
you
put
the
footnote
there,
because
the
circuits
were
interpreting
differently
all
around,
and
i
still
say
that
after
simmons
you
still
have
the
same
thing,
even
the
self-incriminating
aspect
of
it.
i
still
say
we
have
the
same
thing.
and
as
far
as
the
automatic
standing
because
of
the
vice
of
self-prosecution
contradictions,
i
think
still
was
standard.
there
is
nothing
that
has
happened
in
any
circuit,
there
is
nothing
that
happened
in
this
court
which
changes
that
one
iota.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
intimated
in
brown
that
it
still
is
viable,
and
rakas
was
a
little
after
brown,
of
course.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
no,
the
occasion
wasn't
there
for
you
to
reaffirm.
mr.
willie
j.
davis
i
believe
that
my
brother
has
fifteen
minutes
and
i
will
leave
the
remaining
arguments
to
him.
thank
you.
