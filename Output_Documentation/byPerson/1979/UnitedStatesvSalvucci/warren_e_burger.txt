we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
79-244,
united
states
v.
salvucci
and
zackular.
mr.
levy,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
ever
any
different
separable
purpose
in
searches
and
seizures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
find
other
evidence
not
in
the
warrant,
but
then
you
have
other
problems,
don't
you,
if
you
have
a
warrant?
i
just
didn't
understand
your
separation
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
it
be
used
against
him
any
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
got
your
point
about
the
lead,
if
he
answered
"i
got
them
from
sam
jones"
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
do
you
see
that
there
is
something
impermissible
or
wrong
about
there
going
to
sam
jones
and
saying
did
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
impermissible
in
some
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcbride.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
mcbride.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcbride,
you
may
pick
up
where
you
left
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
this
"who
guessed
the
special
advantage."
isn't
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
inherently
a
motion
to
suppress
the
truth?
isn't
that
the
very
function
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
what
i
was
addressing
myself
to.
the
operational
function
of
it
is
to
suppress
some
of
the
truth
that
is
likely
to
be
or
may
be
used
against
him.
it
isn't
necessarily
all
of
the
truth,
but
it
is
some
truth
that
he
does
not,
the
defendant
does
not
want
the
jury
to
know
about,
otherwise
he
wouldn't
move
to
suppress,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judge
doesn't
make
any
decision
at
the
pretrial
except
whether
it
will
or
will
not
be
admitted
in
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
isn't
making
any
judgment
about
the
case,
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
checks
were
there
altogether?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
several
hundred?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levy,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
he
does
not
testify
as
here?
he
did
not
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
there
wasn't
any
possibility
of
self-incrimination,
compelled
self-incrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
wasn't
compelled
to
assert
the
ownership,
the
automatic
standing
had
taken
the
place
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
reason
for
the
automatic
standing
rule
was
to
protect
the
defendant
so
that
he
could
assert
the
ownership
for
purposes
of
suppression
without
jeopardizing
his
--
without
incriminating
himself
by
having
that
very
testimony
thrown
in
his
face
before
the
jury.
wasn't
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
basic
rationale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
assertion
can't
be
used,
even
that
limited
assertion
can't
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
harris
and
the
others
it
could
be
used
to
impeach
him
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
