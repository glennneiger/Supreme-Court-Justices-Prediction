justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
no
issue
here
about
other
grounds
for
standing
here,
such
as
an
interest
in
the
premises
or
being
a
guest
on
the
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
the
defendants
in
this
case
contended
that
the
checks
had
been
duly
endorsed
over
to
him
or
some
such
claim
pursuant
to
which
he
claimed
some
rightful
entitlement
to
the
checks,
would
he
have
standing
(a)
to
ask
for
their
return,
and
(b)
to
object
to
the
search
in
the
third
party's
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
not
asking
about
the
theory,
i
am
just
asking
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
alleges
they
are
his.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
agree
he
would
by
that
allegation
have
standing
to
seek
their
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
also
have
standing
by
that
allegation
to
object
to
the
search
of
the
premises
in
which
they
were
found
by
illegal
conduct
of
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
the
contraband
character
of
the
items
that
the
police
seized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
agree
that
even
if
he
had
title
to
the
property,
say
it
was
a
gun
and
he
claimed
it
was
registered
and
he
acknowledge
he
owned
it
and
so
forth
and
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
its
possession
and
it
was
taken
out
of
a
third
party's
premises,
that
would
not
give
him
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
those
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
ask
for
his
property
back,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
ground
could
he
claim
the
seizure
was
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
cannot
challenge
the
search,
which
would
be
the
only
basis
as
i
understand
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
there
were
actually
three
theories
in
jeffers.
i
am
sure
they
are
hinted
at
in
different
parts
of
the
opinion.
one
of
them
was
this
theory
of
when
a
search
is
directed
at
a
particular
defendant.
i
don't
understand
that
theory
as
being
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
is
that
correct?
by
directed
at,
do
you
understand
what
i
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
theory
isn't
presented
in
this
case
at
all,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
claim
of
that
kind,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
automatic
standing
rule
does
permit
the
defendant
to
take
advantage
of
a
violation
of
somebody
else's
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
the
only
reason
that
was
ever
given
for
it
is
that
the
evidence
that
he
might
give
at
the
suppression
hearing
might
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
that
is
the
only
meaningful
reason
it
has
ever
been
used,
ever
been
given.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be,
but
the
reason
that
the
defendant
could
rely
on
the
violation
of
somebody
else's
rights
is
that
they
didn't
want
to
put
him
to
the
trouble
of
claiming
his
own
right,
because
it
could
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
if
he
claimed
that
he
himself
had
an
interest
in
the
premises
or
he
himself
had
an
interest
in
the
goods
seized,
that
might
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial
and
he
shouldn't
be
put
in
that
dilemma.
isn't
that
the
reason
it
was
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
automatic
standing
rule
prevents
you
from
knowing
whether
you
are
in
an
alderman
situation
or
not.
you
just
don't
even
inquire.
whosever
rights
were
violate,
the
defendant
gets
the
advantage
of
it
by
the
automatic
standing
rule.
that's
the
purpose
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcbride,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
alternative
argument
the
government
makes
that
standing
as
we
use
the
term
doesn't
really
turn
on
possession
at
all,
it
turns
on
invasion
of
a
privacy
area
rather
than
even
if
you
had
ownership
of
the
article
you
would
not
have
standing,
according
to
their
alternative
argument,
to
object
to
an
invasion
of
the
home
in
which
you
have
no
privacy
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
case
holding
that
ownership
of
an
item
is
sufficient
to
give
you
standing
to
object
to
a
search
of
premises
in
which
you
have
no
privacy
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
ownership
isn't
enough,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
that
possession
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
a
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk,
rather,
the
container
in
which
the
goods
were
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
arkansas
v.
sanders,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
those
don't
reach
my
question
which
is
you
have
either
a
possessory
or
a
legal
or
any
kind
of
an
interest
in
the
item
seized
but
no
claim
to
privacy
in
the
location
in
which
the
item
happened
to
be
found
by
the
police,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
really
squarely
meets
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
issue
is
whether
they
are
unlawfully
there.
there
aren't
any
on
that
point,
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
if
the
warrant
is
bad,
would
you
have
a
standing
to
attack
the
warrant,
that
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
only
point
is
i
don't
know
of
a
case
directly
in
point
on
the
proposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
the
motion
say
in
this
case
to
suppress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
motion
itself
against
our
ordinary
fourth
amendment
cases
is
in
itself
an
assertion
that
i
am
entitled
to
suppress
this
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
that
the
majority
attached
greater
significance
to
property
than
the
dissenters
did
in
rakas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
passenger
in
rakas
had
been
a
part
owner
of
the
car,
that
he
would
have
had
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
passenger
in
rakas
had
been
a
part-owner
of
the
car,
would
you
have
thought
he
still
did
not
have
standing?
you
only
have
standing
for
the
driver,
would
that
be
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
that
have
been
the
critical
fact
as
in
rakas
the
passenger
did
not
have
standing,
but
if
he
had
been
a
part
owner
of
the
car,
presumably
he
would
have
had
standing
so
therefore
doesn't
that
make
ownership
the
critical
test
under
the
rakas
approach
on
which
you
seem
to
rely?
