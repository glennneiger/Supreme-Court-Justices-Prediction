justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
we've
talked
a
lot
about
rakas,
in
your
view
is
your
position
consistent
with
the
position
taken
by
the
dissenters
in
rakas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
the
dissenters
placed
stress
on
the
privacy
aspect,
the
expectation
of
privacy,
is
that
right?
