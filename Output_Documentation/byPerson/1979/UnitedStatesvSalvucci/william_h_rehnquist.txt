justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levy,
it
is
actually
the
defendant
that
brings
a
suppression
motion,
not
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
government
is
just
advancing
arguments
as
to
why
the
suppression
motion
shouldn't
be
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
really
make
much
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
has
a
right
of
eminent
domain,
i
take
it,
in
any
of
these
cases,
that
it
could
seize
items
and
pay
for
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress,
not
the
government's.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
defendant
is
certainly
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant
would
certainly
be
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
he
pleads
not
guilty,
it
puts
all
the
material
issues
and
material
elements
in
issue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
the
whole
point
at
issue
in
the
suppression,
isn't
it,
whether
or
not
the
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
defendant
were
violated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
agree,
mr.
davis,
that
both
alderman
and
rakas
significantly
questioned
the
automatic
standing
rule,
and
brown
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
a
footnote
in
rakas
that
says
we
don't
have
to
face
it,
it
is
up
in
the
air,
in
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
certainly
didn't
reaffirm
it
in
brown.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
judge
janu
thought
that
the
matter
was
in
considerable
doubt
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
think
then
that
rakas
expressly
reserved
the
question
as
to
whether
jones
was
still
good
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
to
overrule
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question
to
your
colleague
that
the
defendant
is
also
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth
when
he
asserts
possession
for
purposes
of
a
suppression
motion,
whether
it
be
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue
or
standing
query,
and
then
enters
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
which
means
a
general
denial
to
all
of
the
allegations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
client
doesn't
have
to
testify
at
all
at
trial,
as
i
understood
the
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
simply
by
pleading
not
guilty,
he
puts
in
issue,
that
is
he
denies
the
allegation
of
possession.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
exactly,
and
then
that
is
his
problem,
not
the
government's.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
lots
of
dilemmas
in
criminal
trials
that
defendants
face.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
helps
the
jury
or
judge
to
determine
the
truth
of
the
charges
brought
against
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
automatic
standing
rule
helps
in
the
long
run
a
jury
or
fact-finder
to
determine
the
truth
of
the
charges
brought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
prevent
the
evidence
from
being
adduced
at
trial,
so
presumably
you
wouldn't
do
it
unless
you
thought
the
evidence
was
relevant
and
material
and
probative.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
fourth
amendment
right
of
your
client
was
violated,
if
the
warrant
was
bad?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
talk
about
jones,
talk
about
the
fourth
amendment.
what
fourth
amendment
right
of
your
client
was
violated
if
the
warrant
was
bad?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
not
only
advocated,
it
was
a
court
opinion.
