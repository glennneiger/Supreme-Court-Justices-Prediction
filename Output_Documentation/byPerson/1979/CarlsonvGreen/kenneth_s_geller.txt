mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
after
respondent's
son,
joseph
jones,
died
in
a
prison
hospital
in
terre
haute,
indiana.
a
year
later,
the
respondent
brought
suit
as
administratrix
of
jones'
estate
and
as
jones'
next
of
kin
alleging
that
her
son's
death
was
the
result
of
grossly
inadequate
and
inappropriate
medical
treatment
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
respondent
named
as
defendants
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
the
warden
of
the
terre
haute
penitentiary,
the
assistant
surgeon
general,
the
chief
medical
officer
of
the
terre
haute
prison
hospital,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
terre
haute.
well,
i
don't
think
i
intended
to
say
it
again,
but
thank
you.(laughter)
also
named
were
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
a
doctor's
aide
and
a
hospital
guard
at
the
terre
haute
hospital.
all
defendants
were
sued
in
their
individual
as
well
as
their
official
capacities.
the
respondent
asked
for
$1.5
million
in
compensatory
damages
and
$500,000
in
punitive
damages.
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
held
that
respondent
had
sufficiently
alleged
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
directly
under
the
eighth
amendment
under
the
theory
of
this
court's
decisions
in
bivens
and
estelle
v.
gamble,
but
it
dismissed
the
complaint
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
the
court
held
that
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
indiana
law
limited
respondent's
recovery
on
account
of
her
son's
death
to
the
reasonable
hospital
medical
and
burial
expenses
and
expenses
of
administration.
the
court
held
that
it
was
therefore
apparent
that
respondent
could
not
satisfy
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
for
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
27
u.s.c
1331.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
judge
that
the
respondent
had
stated
a
bivens
type
cause
of
action
for
damages
directly
under
the
eighth
amendment,
but
it
refused
to
apply
the
indiana
survival
and
wrongful
death
provisions
to
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
"whenever
the
relevant
state
survival
statute
would
abate
a
bivens
type
action
brought
against
defendants
whose
conduct
results
in
death,
the
federal
common
law
allows
survival
of
the
action."
i
should
add
at
this
point,
although
i
hope
to
come
back
to
it
later,
that
while
it
is
true
that
by
applying
the
indiana
survival
statutes,
respondent's
claims
would
abate,
that
is
because
of
the
federal
jurisdictional
amount
in
controversy
requirement
and
not
because
of
any
provisions
of
the
indiana
statutes
themselves.
now,
the
petition
in
this
case
presents
two
independent
questions.
the
first
is
whether
it
is
proper
for
the
courts
to
apply
a
bivens
type
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
eighth
amendment
in
instances
where
an
existing
federal
statute,
here
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
provides
an
adequate
federal
damages
remedy.
the
second
question,
which
need
only
be
reached
if
the
court
disagrees
with
petitioners'
first
point
and
holds
that
an
eighth
amendment
cause
of
action
exists,
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
the
survival
of
respondent
bivens'
action
is
governed
by
federal
common
law
rather
than
by
the
state
statutes
that
apply
to
analogous
cases.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
question
of
implying
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
for
damages
directly
under
the
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
the
district
court
is
correct
--
and
we
believe
that
it
is
--
then
the
$10,000
amount
in
controversy
requirement
has
not
been
met.
there
is
jurisdiction
if
that
has
been
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
are
questioning
federal
jurisdiction
--
we
are
not
questioning
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
bell
v.
hood
sense,
but
we
are
saying
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
are
arguing
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
because
the
respondent
cannot
reach,
recovery
cannot
reach
the
$10,000
minimum.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
punitive
damages
are
not
recoverable
under
the
indiana
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
think
it
does
turn
on
whether
you
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
don't
think
you
have
to
--
i
would
be
happy
to
argue
it
first,
but
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
don't
have
to
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
could
be
phrased
that
way
because
if
federal
law
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
not
phrased
it
that
way
but
i
think
it
could
be
phrased
that
way
in
the
sense
that
if
state
survival
law
rather
than
federal
common
law
survival
remedy
applies,
then
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction,
but
that
is
in
some
ways
just
a
peculiarity
of
this
case
and
i
didn't
want
to
make
the
case
turn
on
it
and
we
have
argued
the
question
of
whether
the
state
or
federal
survival
law
should
apply
to
bivens
type
actions.
but
that
is
an
issue
that
the
court
need
not
reach
unless
there
is
a
bivens
type
action
in
this
case,
because
if
the
action
should
proceed
under
the
tort
claims
act
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
then
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
only
in
the
sense
that
if
you
decide
on
the
second
issue
that
state
law
applies,
then
the
case
drops
out
because
the
$10,000
limit
jurisdictional
amount
in
controversy
limit
has
not
been
satisfied.
the
case
could
then
proceed,
however,
in
state
court
if
the
court
were
to
decide
on
the
first
issue,
that
there
is
a
bivens
cause
of
action
rather
than
a
federal
tort
claims
act
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
law
allows
punitive
damages
to
be
recovered,
then
they
may
be
included
in
determining
whether
the
$10,000
limit
has
been
reached
if
the
complaint
states
a
claim
that
could
fairly
lead
to
the
recovery
of
punitive
damages.
however,
in
this
case
if
indiana
law
governs
on
the
question
of
survival,
it
is
clear
that
punitive
damages
can't
be
recovered
because
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
damages
that
the
statute
allows.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
not
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
except
that
if
you
proceed
under
the
tort
claims
act,
mr.
justice
white,
you
don't
have
to
--
you
are
not
proceeding
under
section
1331
for
jurisdiction
and
you
don't
have
to
meet
the
$10,000
amount
in
controversy
requirement.
you
are
proceeding
under
1346.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
we
don't
think
you
can
get
punitive
damages
--
it
is
clear
you
can't
get
punitive
damages
under
the
tort
claims
act,
and
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
you
can't
get
punitive
damages
under
the
bivens
cause
of
action
because
that
depends
on
the
peculiarities
of
indiana
survival
law.
but
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
perhaps
not
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
his
argument
is
that
a
bivens
cause
of
--
the
survival
of
a
bivens
cause
of
action
is
not
limited
by
state
law.
but
if
you
reject
that
notion
and
say
it
is
governed
by
the
state
law
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
that
the
indiana
statutes
don't
allow
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
only
if
you
accept
the
argument
that
state
rather
than
federal
law
applies.
if
you
accept
that
argument,
then
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
between
the
parties
that
indiana
law
doesn't
allow
for
punitive
damages
in
this
situation.
now,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
court
should
not
create
constitutional
damage
remedies
in
situations
where
there
exist
a
statutory
remedy
available
to
fully
compensate
a
plaintiff
for
his
injuries.
in
this
case
we
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
and
we
do
not
take
the
respondent
to
dispute
that
respondent's
allegations
of
grossly
inadequately
or
even
deliberately
indifferent
medical
mistreatment
would
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
that
complete
compensatory
relief
and
damages
may
be
obtained
under
the
federal
statute.
this
court
has
already
held
in
united
states
v.
muniz
that
medical,
malpractice
claims
by
federal
prisoners
are
within
the
ftca.
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances
the
court
should
remit
plaintiffs
such
as
respondent
to
that
existing
federal
statutory
remedy,
rather
than
creating
a
remedy
themselves.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
did
not.
we
have
stated
as
much
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
we
acknowledge
that
the
court
has
a
rule
that
it
will
not
normally
consider
issues
not
raised
below,
but
that
is
not
an
inflexible
or
absolute
rule
and
we
have
put
forward
certain
considerations
in
footnote
9
which
we
think
should
lead
the
court
in
this
case
to
confront
the
issue.
i
should
also
add
that
respondents
have
joined
us
in
this
suggested,
they
have
not
asked
that
the
court
granted
and
the
therefore
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
the
court's
rule
is
based
on
notions
of
fairness
to
the
adverse
party,
not
having
new
arguments
made
that
the
adverse
party
has
not
had
the
chance
to
confront,
we
don't
think
those
considerations
apply
here.
but
we
acknowledge
and
we
acknowledge
the
first
opportunity
we
had
after
we
learned
of
it
that
this
precise
issue
was
not
presented
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
as
to
the
first
question,
it
might
perhaps.
i
mean
the
court
has
a
rule
that
it
will
not
normally
consider
issues
that
were
not
raised
below.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
a
flexible
rule
but
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
we
did
raise
the
second
question
unquestionably
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
reached
the
issue,
and
that
is
properly
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
that
the
principal
difference
between
the
respondent
and
the
petitioners
on
this
point
is
that
respondent
maintains
that
bivens
actions
for
damages
are
a
matter
of
"constitutional
compulsion,"
and
that
federal
courts
are
automatically
obliged
to
imply
such
causes
of
action
at
least
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
and
unequivocal
statement
by
congress
that
it
intends
to
make
the
particular
statutory
remedy
exclusive.
we
believe,
on
the
other
hand,
that
implication
of
constitutional
causes
of
action
for
damages
are
not
compelled
but
rather
are,
as
justice
powell
stated
last
term
in
davis
v.
passman,
the
matter
of
principal
judicial
discretion
and
that
courts
must
take
into
account
a
number
of
considerations
including
the
availability
of
statutory
relief
in
determining
whether
to
exercise
that
discretion.
now,
the
petitioner's
position
on
this
point
is
supported
we
believe
by
the
very
language
of
bivens
itself.
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
and
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
each
stressed
that
in
the
absence
of
a
fourth
amendment
cause
of
action
for
damages
the
plaintiff
would
have
had
no
effective
means
of
redressing
the
official
wrongs
he
suffered.
indeed,
justice
harlan
specifically
mentioned
that
congress
had
refused
to
waive
the
government's
immunity
from
suit
for
torts
such
as
the
one
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
alleged.
where,
however,
there
is,
in
court's
words,
another
equally
effective
remedy,
the
court
strongly
suggested
in
bivens
that
the
judiciary
ought
to
refrain
from
formulating
an
additional
cause
of
action
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
explicitness
came
in,
explicit
direction
that
there
not
be
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
but
i
don't
--
and
here
there
is
in
fact
an
explicit
statutory
remedy,
so
the
explicit
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
discussed
explicitness
in
the
sense
of
exclusivity,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
when
the
question
is
whether
a
statute
should
be
exclusive,
i
think
the
court
properly
must
look
to
congress
for
the
answer.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct,
and
no
remedy
for
intentional
torts
of
the
type
involved
in
the
bivens
case
was
available
until
1974.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
against
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
that's
true,
it
was
against
the
individual
officer,
although
that
was
not
until
1971.
but
i
think
it
is
significant
that
every
time
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
this
case
is
against
several
officers
of
the
united
states.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
every
time
since
bivens
that
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
confront
the
bivens
issue,
in
brown
v.
general
services
administration,
in
butz
v.
economou,
and
in
davis
v.
passman,
it
is
repeated
the
suggestion
in
bivens
that
it
neither
create
or
extend
the
constitutional
right
of
action
for
damages
where
there
is
an
existing
statutory
remedy.
in
fact,
in
davis
itself
the
court
stated
in
at
least
five
separate
places
in
the
opinion
that
plaintiff
had
no
other
federal
damages
remedy
available
to
her
and
therefore
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
provide
one.
therefore,
if
the
tort
claims
act
is
as
we
believe
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
bivens
claim
such
as
the
one
respondent
has
alleged
under
the
eighth
amendment,
we
think
that
this
court's
prior
decisions
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statutory
remedy
alone
should
be
pursued.
i
would
like
to
turn
then
to
respondent's
argument
that
the
tort
claims
act
is
not
an
act
which
substitutes
for
an
eighth
amendment
bivens
action.
now,
the
respondent
has
catalogued
a
number
of
differences
between
the
two
types
of
actions,
but
in
our
view
the
relevant
question
is
not
whether
the
tort
claims
act
constitutes
a
remedy
identical
in
every
respect
to
that
provided
in
bivens,
but
rather
whether
the
federal
statute
can
and
fully
compensate
for
victims
of
unlawful
government
conduct
such
as
that
alleged
respondent's
complaint.
we
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
plainly
yes.
the
court
remarks
in
carey
v.
piphus
that
the
primary
purpose
of
a
constitutional
damages
action
is
to
provide
monetary
compensation
to
a
plaintiff
for
his
injuries.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
tort
claims
act
unquestionably
covers
medical
malpractice
in
actions
brought
by
federal
prisoners,
and
in
light
of
the
1974
amendments
it
also
now
covers
intentional
torts
by
law
enforcement
officers
such
as
employees
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
says
negligence
or
other
wrongful
act
or
omission,
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
not
limited
to
negligence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely,
yes,
and
that
was
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
under
estelle
v.
gamble
it
is
clear
that
negligence
wouldn't
fall
under
the
eighth
amendment,
there
has
to
be
some
allegation
as
there
is
i
think
in
this
complaint
of
gross
negligence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
historically
i
think
that
is
correct,
although
in
estelle
v.
gamble
the
court
said
it
is
addressed
to
the
wanton,
senseless
infliction
of
pain
which
normally
one
would
think
would
be
intentional.
there
is
an
allegation
in
one
of
the
latter
clauses
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
of
intent,
but
if
you
go
down
the
complaint
it
really
states
a
claim
essentially
for
gross
negligence.
the
complaint
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
essentially
at
pages
10
and
11,
there
are
allegations
of
not
giving
proper
medication,
inadequate
staffing
of
the
hospital,
use
of
a
faulty
respirator,
use
of
a
wrong
drug,
lack
of
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
the
paragraph
to
which
i
referred
a
moment
ago,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
saying
that
at
the
very
end
in
the
final
count
there
is
an
allegation
which
incorporates
all
the
previous
allegations
and
essentially
says
in
conclusory
language
that
they
were
done
maliciously
and
intentionally.
but
if
you
go
through
the
key
portions
of
the
complaint,
which
are
paragraphs
1
through
18,
there
are
allegations
of
gross
negligence,
negligence
albeit
of
a
gross
nature.
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
if
the
events
that
occurred
in
this
case
had
not
occurred
in
a
prison
hospital
with
federal
doctors
but
they
had
occurred
in
a
private
hospital
with
a
private
patient,
the
same
exact
events,
there
would
be
no
question
that
what
would
be
brought
is
a
tort
suit
under
a
state
negligence
law,
a
malpractice
law,
and
there
would
be
fully
adequate
remedy
available
to
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
his
injuries.
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
indiana
law
is
in
any
way
deficient
in
allowing
a
plaintiff
to
recover
if
he
has
been
the
victim
of
malpractice
such
as
has
been
alleged
on
pages
10
and
11
of
this
complaint.
but
the
respondent
nonetheless
points
to
a
number
of
features
of
the
tort
claims
act
suit
that
she
claims
makes
the
statutory
remedy
wholly
inadequate.
first,
she
notes
that
the
tort
claims
act
has
an
administrative
exhaustion
procedure
and
that
jury
trials
are
not
available,
but
these
differences
we
think
really
relate
to
the
procedures
of
adjudication
and
not
to
the
fairness
or
completeness
of
the
compensation
that
may
ultimately
be
awarded
to
a
successful
litigant.
and
i
might
add
that
the
same
restrictions
involving
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
the
absence
of
a
jury
trial
are
present
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
yet
the
court
in
brown
v.
general
services
administration
held
that
title
vii
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
bivens
action
and
for
other
statutory
remedies
challenging
racial
discrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
an
intent
on
the
part
of
economou
to
make
the
remedy
exclusive
of
other
statutes,
that's
correct.
there
is
no
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct,
but
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
there
isn't.
there
isn't,
although
we
don't
think
that
that
is
necessary.
the
cause
of
action,
the
bivens
cause
of
action
was
not
created
by
congress,
it
was
created
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
in
brown
there
was
no
separate
discussion
in
the
court's
opinion
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
the
court
certainly
did
not
say
that
the
fact
that
congress
meant
to
make
title
vii
exclusive
of
other
statutory
remedies
means
that
it
should
also
be
exclusive
of
a
constitutional
remedy,
although
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
in
brown
directly,
a
bivens
claim
directly
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
intended
to
make
it
exclusive
of
other
statutory
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
word
"constitutional"
does
not
appear
i
believe
in
the
opinion,
but
the
court
clearly
made
it
clear
in
brown
that
congress
did
intend
to
make
title
vii
exclusive
remedy
for
racial
discrimination
in
employment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
no
similar
legislative
history
here
with
regard
to
eighth
amendment
bivens
claims
because
the
tort
claims
act
was,
of
course,
passed
well
before
this
court's
decision
in
bivens.
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
tort
claims
act
recognizes
certain
defenses,
such
as
the
due
care
defense,
does
not
destroy
the
effectiveness
of
the
remedy
because
these
defenses
are
essentially
equivalent
we
think
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense
that
would
be
available
to
a
federal
officer
in
a
bivens
action.
finally,
the
respondent
stresses
the
fact
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
under
the
tort
claims
act,
but
punitive
damages
are
not
a
form
of
compensation
and,
as
the
court
held
last
term
in
the
faust
case,
they
are
not
an
essential
attribute
of
an
effective
remedial
scheme.
moreover,
while
deterrence
of
official
misconduct
is
certainly
an
important
goal,
compensatory
damages
serve
to
achieve
that
goal
we
think
to
a
large
extent.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
can
be
said
about
the
'74
senate
report.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
will.
the
first
thing
that
can
be
said
is
that
the
senate
report
was
obviously
referring
to
fourth
amendment
bivens
actions
which,
of
course,
at
that
time
the
only
type
of
bivens
action
this
court
had
recognized.
and
in
bivens
the
court
said
that
tort
remedies
were
not
an
effective
means
of
dealing
with
fourth
amendment
violations
because
frequently
state
tort
law
was
inconsistent
with
or
even
hostile
to
the
interests
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
think
that
first
of
all
the
senate
report
was
only
thinking
about
fourth
amendment
actions
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
to
the
extent
we
can
read
anything
into
this
one
sentence
in
the
senate
report
as
being
congressional
intent,
that
they
did
not
want
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
focus
there
was
obviously
on
the
tort
claim
remedy
that
they
were
establishing
at
the
time
under
section
2680(h)
for
intentional
torts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
correct.
however,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
no,
no.
we
are
arguing
that
you
needn't
look
to
congressional
intent,
that
the
bivens
action
is
a
creation
of
this
court
and
that
the
court
hasn't
decided
for
itself
whether
there
are
adequate
statutory
remedies
available
since
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
would
be
one
factor.
after
all
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
court
could.
it
may
not
be
wise,
but
if
congress
wants
to
create
a
bivens
cause
of
action
it
can
easily
do
so.
now,
the
other
thing
to
be
said
about
the
1974
senate
report,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
clearly
the
suggestion,
at
least
the
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
author
of
the
report
that
bivens
was
a
constitutionally
compelled
remedy,
because
on
the
same
page
of
the
senate
report
on
which
the
sentence
appears
that
you
just
read,
there
is
the
statement
that
in
bivens
the
court
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
the
availability
of
a
damages
action.
now,
to
the
extent
that
congress
thought
that
bivens
actions
were
constitutionally
required
and
that
congress
couldn't
abrogate
them
even
if
it
wanted
to,
i
think
the
statement
in
the
senate
report
is
merely
an
attempt
to
avoid
what
might
be
viewed
by
some
legislators
as
a
possible
constitutional
problem
if
it
were
thought
that
the
2680(h)
remedy
was
intended
to
abrogate
the
bivens
action.
but
once
again
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
2688
claim
here,
it
is
not
a
tort
such
as
congress
allowed
to
be
pursued
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
the
first
time
in
1974,
it
is
a
negligence
action
which
has
always
existed
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
there
is
certainly
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
thought
that
the
state
laws
which
were
incorporated
in
the
tort
claims
act
for
negligence
or
medical
malpractice
albeit
of
an
egregious
kind,
was
not
an
adequate
remedy
and
that
therefore
bivens
actions
would
have
to
continue
to
be
recognized
despite
the
adequacy
of
the
statutory
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
there
is
a
sentence
at
the
very
end
that
says
that
these
were
intentional
torts,
but
we
think
in
light
of
the
1974
amendment
to
the
tort
claims
act
even
intentional
torts
by
law
enforcement
officers
which
employees
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
are
would
now
be
covered
by
the
tort
claims
act.
so
even
if
this
were
construed
to
be
an
action
for
battery,
for
example,
it
would
be
compensable
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
once
again
we
think
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
allow
a
constitutionally
based
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
is
one
case
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
there
is
no
question
that
employees
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
are
law
enforcement
officers
by
virtue
of
i
think
it
is
18
u.s.c
3050
and
that
their
intentional
torts
can
be
the
subject
of
a
tort
claims
act
suit
under
section
2680(h).
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
suit
under
2680(h)
is
against
the
government,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
one
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
situation
in
this
case
is
not
at
all
like
bivens.
in
bivens,
there
was
absolutely
no
federal
remedy
because
congress
hadn't
amended
the
tort
claims
act
yet
to
include
intentional
torts.
secondly,
the
court
said
in
bivens
that
state
trespass
and
invasion
of
privacy
laws
were
not
adequate
to
compensate
victims
of
fourth
amendment
violations
because
such
state
laws
were
often
inconsistent
or
even
hostile
to
the
interests
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
respondent
here
has
never
alleged
much
less
shown
why
state
malpractice
laws
are
not
adequate
to
compensate
for
the
sorts
of
violations
and
injuries
that
occurred
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
he
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
that
the
respondent
has
shown
what
in
indiana
in
the
peculiarities
of
indiana
malpractice
law
prevents
full
compensation
for
the
sorts
of
injuries
alleged
in
the
complaint.
we
think
that
this
is
the
sort
of
a
case
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
carey
v.
piphus
when
it
said
that
in
some
cases
the
interests
protected
by
a
particular
branch
of
the
common
law
of
torts
may
parallel
closely
the
interests
protected
by
a
particular
constitutional
right.
here
we
think
there
is
that
parallel
and
therefore
we
don't
think
the
court
should
extend
the
implied
constitutional
damages
action
of
bivens.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
you
mean
bivens,
the
actual
bivens
sort
of
action?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that
is
a
question
i
think
quite
similar
to
the
one
mr.
justice
white
asked
me.
i
think
our
argument
if
accepted
might
lead
to
that
result
but
it
needn't
because
of
what
i
just
said,
the
state
laws
that
would
be
picked
up
in
the
tort
claims
act
to
cover
trespasses
or
the
sorts
of
invasions
in
bivens.
the
court
said
in
bivens
were
not
adequate
frequently
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
interests
at
stake,
and
i
think
this
might
have
been
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'74
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
no,
there
has
to
be
we
think
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely,
that
is
our
position,
and
there
is
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
because
this
is
a
federal
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
and
we
think
that
people
who
have
that
right
violated
should
be
entitled
to
a
remedy
in
federal
court.
that
was
what
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
that
is
what
congress
has
chosen
to
do,
but
it
is
still
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
congress
we
think
has
made
that
judgment
in
cases
like
this,
that's
correct,
and
we
don't
think
in
that
situation
there
is
any
need
for
this
court
to
extend
the
implied
constitutional
damage
action
that
it
recognized
in
bivens.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
extend
it
to
a
situation
where
there
is
an
adequate
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
extend
it
to
a
situation
that
didn't
exist
in
bivens
which
is
that
where
there
is
a
federal
statutory
remedy
that
is
fully
adequate.
thank
you
very
much.
