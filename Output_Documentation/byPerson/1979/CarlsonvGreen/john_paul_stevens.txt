in
any
event,
it
is
not
allowable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nevertheless
you
would
be
arguing
that
punitive
damages,
the
availability
of
punitive
damages
doesn't
militate
against
implying
a
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know,
that
your
brother
would
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suppose
that
he
would
say
that
a
bivens
cause
of
action
is
not
limited
by
the
indiana
provisions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
we
accept
your
argument,
not
if
you
are
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
the
court
refer
to
some
explicit
congressional
directive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
no
explicit
statutory
directive
that
it
be
exclusive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
the
court
in
brown
infer
an
intent
to
make
the
remedy
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
was
a
proof
of
remedy
basis
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
argue
that
there
is
any
such
intent
here,
do
you?
there
is
no
such
evidence
of
a
similar
congressional
intent,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
only
directed
to
your
reliance
on
the
brown
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
cases
that
construe
the
'74
amendments
to
include
prison
guards
and
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
law
enforcement
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
claim
couldn't
be
brought
in
robertson
at
all,
could
it,
because
there
just
didn't
happen
to
be
that
kind
of
a
person
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
court
should
imply
a
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
other
reason
for
not
implying
it
maybe,
if
they
thought
it
should
be
exclusive,
but
it
is
not
the
only
reason
for
not
having
an
implied
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
the
implied
bivens
type
constitutional
remedy
survived
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
made
that
type
suit
available
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
the
bivens
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
suppose
there
had
been
no
federal
tort
claims
act
and
there
was
a
bivens
action
brought,
would
you
argue
that
just
the
existence
of
a
malpractice
remedy
in
indiana
would
foreclose
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
to
be
an
alternative
remedy
under
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why,
pray
tell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
under
state
law,
then
why
would
you
imply
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
remedy
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
going
to
be
by
reference
to
the
indiana
law.
