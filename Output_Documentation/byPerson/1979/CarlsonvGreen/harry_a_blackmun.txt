justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
we
agree
with
you
with
respect
to
the
tort
claims
act,
that
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
preclusive
here.
what
do
you
do
about
robertson
v.
wegmann?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
just
say
that
here
it
is
hostile
and
there
it
wasn't?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
if
indiana
law
says
no
survivorship
unless
you
leave
a
spouse,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
be
here.
