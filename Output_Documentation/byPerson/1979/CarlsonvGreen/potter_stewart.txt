justice

nor
is
this
case
against
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
congress
may
have
intended
to
make
it
exclusive
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
then
the
question
might
be
whether
or
not
it
could,
whether
or
not
it
could.
justice
potter
stewart
nonetheless,
it
might
well
have
intended
to
and
i
think,
as
i
remember
brown
--
i
wrote
it
--
i
think
i
wrote
that
congress
intended
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
exclusive
remedy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
exclusive
of
all
other
statutory
and
constitutional
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
would
say
at
least
that
even
though
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
give
remedy
for
some
constitutional
torts,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
preempt
implying
a
constitutional
cause
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
pretty
clear
that
whatever
kinds
of
causes
of
action
they
were
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
would
be
parallel
remedies
there.
justice
potter
stewart
so
at
least
congress
was
recognizing
that
the
existence,
the
mere
existence
of
a
tort
claims
remedy
would
not
bar
bivens
type
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
what
you
are
arguing
--
you
are
just
arguing
the
reverse
now.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
there
that
requires
survival?
survival
is
a
matter
of
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
wasn't
any
survival
until
lord
campbell's
act,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
since
you
and
i
agree
that
it
is
a
matter
of
statute,
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
guarantees
survival?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
hostile
to
the
constitution
not
to
have
survival?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
die
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
wrong.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
that,
for
just
a
minute,
what
was
judge
nolan,
what
was
he
--
he
is,
of
course,
an
indiana
judge
--
what
was
his
rationale
for
his
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
he
concluded,
did
he
not,
that
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law
the
claim
survived
but
the
only
damages
recoverable
were
hospital
expenses
and
burial
expenses
and
they
didn't
come
to
$10,000.
justice
potter
stewart
he
concluded
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law
that
the
claim
survived.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
construing
indiana
law,
he
found
survivorship.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
said
the
damages
recoverable
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law
don't
reach
$10,000.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
my
question
to
you
is
is
it
not
possible
that
you
have
separate
questions,
one,
does
the
action
survive,
and,
secondly,
if
so
what
damages
are
recoverable.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
possibly
the
first
question
might
be
a
matter
of
state
law
and
the
second
question
might
be
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
are
two
indiana
judges
on
the
panel,
judge
grant
was
also
from
indiana.
justice
potter
stewart
in
my
brother
white's
hypothetical
case,
that
is
an
indiana
statute
that
says
there
shall
be
survival
of
an
action
if
there
is
a
surviving
widow
and
only
if
there
is
a
surviving
widow,
would
the
adequacy
of
the
state
remedy
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there
were
a
surviving
widow?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
under
your
submission,
not
what
i
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case
it
would
facilitate
the
interests
involved
if
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
survivorship
if
there
were
a
widow
and
in
this
case
there
is
a
widow.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
in
this
hypothetical
case
there
is
a
widow.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
all
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there
were
a
widow.
justice
potter
stewart
if
not,
then
you
would
have
to
go
under
a
bivens
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
you
and
i
were
dealing
with
statutory,
didn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
at
common
law,
there
was
no
survivorship?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
can
there
be
a
common
law
of
survivorship?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
an
admiralty
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn't
common
law,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
common
law,
it
was
admiralty
law,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
admiralty
law.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
there
is
a
difference
between
admiralty
law
and
common
law,
isn't
there?
i
always
felt
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
name
one?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
deterrence
rationale,
of
course,
you
have
got
a
lot
of
different
defendants
here,
would
you
suggest
that
punitive
damages
is
appropriate
against
norman
carlson,
for
example,
the
director
of
prisons?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
you
could
equally
claim
them
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
it
is
based
on
specific
contact.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
