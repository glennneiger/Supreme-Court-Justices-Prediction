mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
deutsch,
and
i
am
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
government
urges
before
this
court
two
related
theories
which
would
provide
no
remedy
at
all
for
the
decedent
in
this
case,
despite
the
serious
deprivations
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
he
has
suffered.
it
is
imperative
that
the
court
properly
understand
the
claims
that
we
brought
here.
we
brought
a
claim
for
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs
causing
death.
this
court
in
estelle
v.
gamble
held
that
that
claim
in
that
language,
and
the
district
court
found
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
it,
created
an
eighth
amendment
violation
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
it
recognized
that
this
man,
joseph
jones,
was
in
the
custody
of
the
government.
he
could
not
walk
down
the
street
and
get
medical
care,
he
had
to
rely
on
the
government
to
give
him
that
medical
care.
and
when
he
went
out
to
a
private
hospital
and
the
doctor
there
said
transfer
this
man
to
another
prison
because
he
had
asthma
and
the
government
ignored
that,
and
when
the
doctor
of
the
private
hospital
said
give
this
man
medication
for
his
asthma
and
the
government
ignored
that,
and
when
the
man
predictably
had
a
serious
asthma
attack
and
when
he
went
to
the
hospital
for
eight
hours
no
doctor
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
came
to
see
him,
and
when
the
respirator
didn't
work,
even
though
they
knew
for
two
weeks
that
it
wasn't
working,
and
when
they
gave
him
thorazine
which
killed
him,
and
that
hospital,
even
though
thorazine
is
clearly
contra-indicated
for
asthma
--
we
say
that
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
what
justice
marshall
said
in
estelle,
in
the
worst
cases
it
causes
torture
and
lingering
death,
and
that
is
what
joseph
jones
suffered
and
that
is
what
we
allege
and
that
is
what
the
courts
below
found,
based
on
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
our
complaint
as
the
court
must
take
them
to
be
true.
and
we
also
claim
that
government
deprived
him
of
life
without
due
process
of
law,
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
clearly
it
is
recognized
as
one
under
the
fifth
amendment,
as
well
as
that
deprivation
was
caused
by
racial
animus,
another
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
do
not
allege
medical
malpractice.
we
do
not
allege
battery.
we
do
not
allege
any
tort
or
any
negligence
theory.
we
come
here
and
we
have
come
to
the
federal
court
with
a
violation
of
a
fundamental
protection
of
the
bill
of
rights
against
federal
officers
in
a
federal
prison.
now,
i
ask
you,
why
doesn't
bivens
apply
to
that
claim?
is
not
the
eighth
and
the
fifth
amendment
an
independent
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government?
isn't
that
what
bivens
said?
are
there
any
special
factors
counseling
hesitation
in
this
case?
has
congress
explicitly
said
that
joe
jones
should
not
get
damages?
is
it
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
it
is
equally
effective,
judge.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
agree,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
there
is
an
equally
effective
remedy
for
the
constitutional
deprivation
that
joe
jones
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
we
wouldn't
need
to,
we
would
have
an
equally
effective
remedy
for
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
why
would
we
come?
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
appropriate
basis
for
the
court
to
say
otherwise
the
statutory
scheme
was
equally
effective
and
we
wouldn't
have
anything
to
argue
about.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
but
it
really
gets
to
a
fundamental
question
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
tort
claims
act
is
and
how
it
operates.
it
is
not
only
the
specific
regulations
in
the
act,
it
is
the
whole
ideology
behind
the
act.
the
act
itself
makes
you
go
to
state
law
to
fill
in
all
the
aspects
of
your
claim.
you
go
to
state
law
to
determine
your
cause
of
action,
you
go
to
state
law
to
determine
your
damages,
you
go
to
state
law
to
determine
whether
the
claim
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would
say
that
for
a
constitutional
violation
it
is
never
an
equally
effective
remedy,
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
you
can
look
to
state
law
to
facilitate
the
policies
behind
the
constitutional
right,
but
if
the
state
law
is
inconsistent
or
hostile
you
don't
have
to
apply
it.
in
the
tort
claims
act,
you
have
to
apply
it
whether
or
not
it
totally
wipes
out
your
claim.
in
our
case,
if
we
apply
the
indiana
state
law
of
survival,
we
have
no
claim.
joe
jones
is
dead
but
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
at
all.
that
is
not
facilitating
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
wait
a
minute.
the
statute
of
limitations
i
would
maintain
is
a
different
question
because
the
statute
of
limitations,
you
are
suppose
to
bring
to
a
case,
you
don't
bring
it
and
you
are
out,
your
case
is
dismissed
because
of
some
kind
of
laches
theory.
now,
if
it
is
two
years
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
it
is
hostile
but
the
litigant
could
have
brought
the
claim
within
a
certain
period
of
time
and
didn't.
i
am
talking
about
hostility
where
it
wipes
the
claim
out.
joe
jones
could
never
bring
a
claim
for
survival
because
indiana
law
wipes
it
out.
that
is
hostility.
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
a
kind
of
hostile
state
provision
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
yes,
but
now
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
as
the
court
found
in
moragne,
which
created
a
federal
common
law
wrongful
death,
but
most
statutes
have
survival.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
it
is,
judge,
but
if
you
look
to
the
state
statute
and
that
statute
is
hostile
to
your
right
to
collect,
deprivation
of
life,
if
the
statute
wipes
that
out
then
your
fifth
amendment
right
is
meaningless.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
there
is
nothing
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
it
is
hostile
to
the
constitution,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
federal
constitutional
right
and
a
federal
enclave
against
federal
individuals,
and
you
look
to
state
law
and
the
state
law
is
inconsistent
and
hostile,
whether
or
not
you
apply
federal
common
law
--
that
is
what
judge
swygert
did
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
that
is
the
question
that
is
left
open
by
robertson
v.
wegmann,
which
says
if
the
person
dies
as
a
result
of
a
constitutional
deprivation
claim,
you
have
to
facilitate
that
right.
you
can't
look
to
state
law
when
there
is
no
state
interest
involved
and
it
will
wipe
out
that
right.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
judge.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no.
there
are
two
statutes
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
it
is
the
wrongful
death
statute.
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
the
survival
statute
which
says
if
you
die
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
claim,
it
does
not
survive,
nobody
recovers.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no.
it
is
a
state
law.
it
is
dealing
with
the
state
interests.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
right,
if
you
die
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
wrong,
right.
in
addition,
there
is
a
wrongful
death
statute
which
says
that
if
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
he
applied
both
the
wrongful
death
and
the
survival
statute
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
because
he
applied
the
wrongful
death
statute.
we
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
right,
he
did.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
he
assumed
that
he
was
bound
by
indiana
law,
he
had
to
apply
indiana
law.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
he
found
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
if
the
action
does
survive
and
the
question
is
one
of
damages
and
it
does
survive
for
joseph
jones
and
then
damages
is
a
question,
as
justice
white
said
in
his
dissent
in
jones
v.
hildebran,
a
question
of
federal
common
law,
and
don't
apply
the
limitations,
that
would
be
fine
because
you
would
be
fashioning
a
remedy
which
would
facilitate
the
interests
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
joe
jones
brings.
the
idea
is
to
facilitate
those
interests.
it
is
not
to
cut
it
off.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
i
would
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
but
i
would
suggest
that
judge
nolan
would
be
wrong
in
that
because
it
wipes
out
the
claim
that
is
brought
for
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
for
example
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
because
we
didn't
bring
a
claim
for
wrongful
death.
this
is
joseph
jones'
estate.
the
claim
is
for
the
deprivation
of
violation
of
joseph
jones'
constitutional
rights.
wrongful
death
is
when
the
survivors
bring
a
claim
for
the
violation
of
their
own
rights.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
and
justice
swygert
found
so,
he
clearly
found
so,
and
justice
swygert
is
a
justice
from
indiana,
he
knows
the
indiana
law
just
as
well
as
judge
nolan.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
do.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that's
false.
that
is
absolutely
false.
if
the
court
carefully
reads
the
survival
statute
and
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
justice
swygert's
opinion,
it
will
be
clear
that
there
is
no
survival
statute
at
all
for
claims
where
you
die
as
a
result
of
them.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that's
right,
judge.
i
want
to
stress
this
point
about
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
probably
not.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
contention
that
the
government
makes
here
is
so
groundless
and
so
specious
that
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
really
focus
on
because
it
is
the
very
same
claim
that
bivens
made
before
this
court
and
it
was
rejected.
what
did
bivens
say?
bivens
said
that
--
the
government
said
in
bivens
that
this
man
has
a
cause
of
action
in
state
tort
law,
he
should
bring
it
there
and
it
should
be
like
two
private
parties
suing
each
other.
the
court
rejected
that.
they
said
that
it
should
be
limited
to
state
tort
remedies.
they
say
here
and
in
bivens
that
the
government
conceded
that
every
time
someone
sued
in
state
court
under
that
theory
they
would
lose
the
court
to
federal
court.
so
you
have
got
a
case
under
state
tort
law
being
litigated
in
federal
court.
that
is
what
the
court
rejected
in
bivens.
here
we
got
a
case
of
federal
court
under
the
tort
claims
act,
we
have
to
apply
state
law
on
every
single
substantive
issue
and
procedural
issue.
justice
blackmun,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
robertson
v.
wegmann,
specifically
said
that
the
state
tort
law
policy
is
not
sufficient
to
protect
the
rights
of
disfavored
groups.
the
court
in
monroe
v.
pape,
in
bivens,
in
davis
have
consistently
said
state
tort
law
is
insufficient
here.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
we
are
not
going
to
say
that
to
make
stronger
protections
for
state
officials'
violations
of
rights
rather
than
federal
officials
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
that
is
the
very
question
that
was
left
open
in
robertson.
it
said
we
don't
have
--
we
are
not
talking
about
a
specific
abatement
case
in
one
case,
which
happens
here.
we
are
talking
about
general
hostility
because
no
case
survives.
specifically,
what
the
case
in
robertson
v.
wegmann
left
open
is
if
the
person
dies
as
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
action,
the
court
said
we
are
not
holding
that
that
claim
would
survive
because
what
about
the
policies
of
deterrence
and
compensation.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
no.
that
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
--
are
you
saying
a
spouse
to
bring
the
action
in
the
main
in
a
survival
case?
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
too
restrictive
and
too
inhospitable
to
facilitate
--
i
don't
even
think
you
have
to
go
to
indiana
law.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
first
of
all,
robertson
was
a
case
against
state
court
officials
and
1988
said
you
have
to
go
to
indiana
law.
we
don't
have
any
state
interests
here.
as
i
said,
we
have
federal
defendants,
we
have
a
federal
enclave,
we
have
federal
constitutional
rights
and
a
federal
prisoner.
the
only
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
don't
concede
it,
judge,
but
i
can
make
a
difference
between
a
statute
of
limitations
and
a
survival
statute
that
precludes
all
claims.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
the
purpose
of
a
survival
statute
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
you
bring
it
in
the
name
--
it
is
for
a
constitutional
deprivation
to
the
person
that
died.
it
doesn't
matter
who
brings
it.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
no.
then
there
is
no
interest
if
the
federal
government
gives
money
and
it
goes
to
the
state,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
but
we
are
talking
about
the
constitutional
violations
to
joe
jones.
his
estate
is
bringing
it.
the
damages
are
measured
by
the
damages
to
him,
not
the
damages
to
his
wife.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
joe
jones
has
a
mother,
has
a
father,
has
a
sister
and
has
a
brother.
it
is
not
like
he
has
nobody
that
would
take
from
his
estate,
and
why
shouldn't
he
be
able
to
collect
from
his
estate?
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
judge.
if
you
would
say
you
had
to
go
to
state
law
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
i
would
say
you
shouldn't
go
to
state
law
unless
it
facilitates
the
interests
involved.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
not
if
the
claim
abated,
it
wouldn't,
if
he
didn't
have
a
wife
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
i'm
sorry,
judge,
there
is
a
mother
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
see,
yes,
there
would
be
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
right.
if
there
were
a
widow
in
the
case,
it
would
not
abate,
then
i
would
say
the
state
law
could
facilitate
the
interests,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
not
a
bivens
claim,
a
federal
common
law
of
survivorship.
the
bivens
claims
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
it
comes
from
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
am
saying
if
there
is
no
state
law
that
facilitates
the
interests,
that
federal
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
right.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
because
as
the
court
did
in
moragne,
the
supreme
court
case
about
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that's
right.
it
looked
at
all
the
state
laws
and
it
said
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
--
and
statutes
--
and
it
said
there
now
has
become
a
common
law
of
survival
and
we
are
going
to
fashion
a
federal
common
law
of
survival.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
but
they
fashioned
a
remedy
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
it
was
an
admiralty
case,
but
it
was
certainly
not
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
there
can
be
common
law
remedies
in
admiralty
cases.
there
are
common
law
structures
that
promote
the
admiralty
interests.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
from
that
case,
from
the
moragne
case,
several
other
courts
of
appeals
have
fashioned
federal
common
law
of
survival
in
cases
similar
to
this.
they
use
that
case
as
a
basis.
i
recognize
that
admiralty
is
different.
i
would
just
say
to
the
court,
once
you
get
beyond
the
fact
that
you
are
applying
in
tort
claims
act
state
law
in
every
instance,
state
law
in
all
of
the
substantive
issues.
then
you
look
at
the
act
itself,
and
we
are
talking
about
constitutional
rights
here.
why
should
he
file
a
medical
malpractice
case
when
he
has
got
an
eighth
amendment
claim?
they
make
you
take
that
claim
and
put
it
forward
as
a
medical
malpractice
case,
he
can't
get
a
jury
trial,
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
are
get
a
jury
trial,
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
are
talking
about
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights
it
is
necessary
that
you
involve
the
public
in
that,
a
jury
trial
is
afforded
to
a
bivens
plaintiff.
the
immunities,
there
are
extra
immunities
under
the
tort
claims
act.
for
example,
there
is
a
discretionary
immunity
which
this
court
specifically
rejected
in
butz.
first
of
all,
you
immunize
all
federal
individual
officers.
they
are
immunized.
then
the
government
in
addition
is
immunized
for
all
discretionary
activities
that
they
did.
all
higher-up
officials
are
immunized
under
2680(a).
so
that
in
an
additional
immunity
and
it
is
a
good
faith
immunity.
there
is
no
punitive
damages.
we
are
talking
about
enforcing
a
constitutional
right,
compensation
and
deterrence,
compensation
and
punishment,
are
fundamental,
have
always
been
fundamental.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
there
hasn't.
carey
v.
piphus,
which
is
a
1983
case,
leaves
that
open.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
case
like
this,
where
a
man
in
prison
had
no
other
alternative
but
wait
for
his
medical
care
and
he
never
got
even
the
most
basic
medical
care,
there
has
to
be
some
deterrence.
and
what
is
the
ramifications
of
going
under
the
tort
claims
act
to
other
constitutional
deprivations
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would.
he
was
specifically
placed
there
--
this
is
the
fourth
person,
fourth
prisoner
at
terre
haute
prison
to
die.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
no.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
normal
carlson
was
specifically
called,
there
were
letters
written
to
him,
there
was
a
protest
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
oh,
yes.
i'm
not
talking
the
respondents'
superior
on
any
of
this.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
normal
carlson
is
specifically
involved
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
doctor
who
did
nothing
is
involved.
i
would
suggest
maybe
there
would
be
punitive
damages
for
the
staff
man
who
was
left
in
the
hospital
for
eight
hours
and
no
doctor
came
while
a
man
died
in
his
hands.
but
certainly
the
higher
ups,
deterrence
is
necessary.
four
prisoners
died
at
terre
haute
prison
in
a
space
of
eight
months
from
grossly
wanton
negligence
in
medical
care,
not
negligence,
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
what
perfect
situation
is
there
for
deterrence
to
get
them
to
change
the
medical
care
that
exists
at
their
prison.
if
you
tell
us
that
we
have
no
claim
under
the
constitution,
where
are
there
going
to
be
changes?
what
remedy
does
joe
jones
have
other
than
damages
in
this
case?
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
judge,
that
would
be
good.
that
would
be
a
deterrence,
but
the
tort
claims
act
is
completely
silent
on
any
disciplinary
mechanism
against
the
individual
who
is
responsible
for
the
action.
very
interestingly
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that
would
be
fine
if
that
happened,
but
first
of
all
we
wouldn't
even
have
a
claim
under
the
tort
claims
act
in
this
case
because
our
claim
would
abate
because
we
would
have
to
apply
state
law.
so
there
would
be
no
deterrence
in
indiana
under
the
tort
claims
act
to
anyone.
in
indiana,
you
had
better
kill
then
rather
than
injure
them
because
you
are
better
off.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
yes,
but
under
indiana
--
indiana
has
an
indiana
medical
malpractice
act,
so
we
would
have
to
convene
a
board
of
doctors
first
and
we
would
have
to
present
our
claim
to
the
doctors,
which
we
would
still
have
to
do
maybe
under
the
tort
claims
act
because
we
have
to
apply
the
law
of
the
place,
and
then
we
would
have
a
limitation,
a
monetary
limitation
on
the
amount
of
recovery.
we
are
caught
in
the
vagaries
of
state
law,
the
limitations,
the
insufficiencies,
and
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
bill
of
rights,
the
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights
of
federal
victims,
victims
of
offenses
of
federal
officials.
right
now,
justice
burger,
the
government,
the
executive
department
of
the
government,
since
1973,
has
been
trying
to
get
the
tort
claims
act
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
there
have
been
three
bills
in
congress,
congress
has
rejected
them,
and
in
order
to
get
it
passed
the
government
has
made
substantial
concessions
that
they
are
not
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
they
agree
to
give
up
qualified
immunity,
which
exists
now
under
the
tort
claims
act,
they
have
put
in
a
strong
disciplinary
schedule
to
punish
people
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
thank
you,
sir.
as
to
the
question
of
robertson
v.
wegmann,
the
subject
of
the
survival
in
the
case
was
death
caused
by
an
extraneous
cause,
not
by
the
actual
claim
brought.
in
other
words,
the
person
didn't
die
as
a
result
of
the
claim.
the
claim
was
brought
and
the
person
died
later
on
and
that
question
was
left
directly
open.
also,
the
lousiana
statute,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
survival
case
in
robertson
allowed
for
many
people
to
bring
the
action,
including
parents.
so
if
we
were
operating
under
the
louisiana
statute
here,
joe
jones
could
bring
a
claim.
the
problem
with
indiana,
nobody
can
bring
a
survival
claim.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
right,
there
was
nobody.
but
there
was
a
lot
of
different
people
who
could
have
brought
the
claim,
including
parents.
as
to
the
question
of
congressional
intent
and
exclusivity,
every
time
the
congress
has
wanted
the
ftca
to
be
exclusive
they
have
specifically
stated
in
the
act
or
in
amendments
--
and
i
refer
the
court
to
28
u.s.c.
2679
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no,
not
necessarily
but
it
is
important
to
look
to
congressional
intent
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
no.
i
would
think,
whether
there
is
an
equally
effective
remedy
is
the
real
question.
but
in
talking
about
congressional
intent,
not
only
did
they
specifically
state
so
when
they
wanted
it
to
be
exclusive
as
to
a
bivens
claim,
the
1974
amendments
specifically
recognizes
that
bivens
--
it
is
a
counterpart
to
bivens,
and
the
senate
report
specifically
says
that.
the
other
thing
about
congressional
intent
is
that
congress
is
in
fact
involved
in
negotiations
with
the
justice
department
about
making
it
exclusive,
and
in
the
course
of
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
broad
changes
being
made
in
the
act
so
it
will
take
up
the
question
of
deterrence
and
compensation.
both
the
government
and
the
congress
have
both
agrees
that
as
it
exists
now
the
ftca
is
not
equally
effective.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
i
would
say
would
create
a
remedy
that
could
redress
the
loss
suffered
by
the
decedent
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
well,
it
would
maybe
address
the
question
of
compensation,
but
the
question
of
deterrence
which
is
one
of
the
twin
goals
of
suing
under
the
constitution
would
not
be
accomplished
because
there
is
no
deterrence
to
these
men
who
have
committed
these
violations
of
citizens'
constitutional
rights.
the
question
of
common
law
of
survival,
if
the
court
looks
at
the
fifth
amendment,
which
says
no
one
shall
be
deprived
of
life
without
due
process
of
law,
how
else
could
someone
sue
for
damage,
for
the
deprivation
of
life
under
the
fifth
amendment
if
there
wasn't
in
effect
some
recognition
that
there
had
to
be
some
common
law
of
survival?
what
you
are
saying,
if
you
apply
indiana
law,
is
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
if
the
person
lives
but
if
the
person
dies
there
isn't.
that
seems
to
fly
right
into
the
face
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
your
honor,
probably,
but
when
we
are
talking
about
the
enforcement
of
fundamental
rights
under
the
fifth
and
eighth
amendments,
i
would
think
a
statute
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
that
would
be
true,
and
1983
certainly
enforces
the
constitutional
rights.
but
if
we
don't
have
such
a
statute
here,
we
have
a
statute
that
is
based
on
state
negligence
law,
and
when
we
are
talking
about
enforcing
constitutional
rights
it
is
not
adequate.
i
also
address
the
court
to
28
u.s.c.
2676
of
the
tort
claims
act
which
recognizes
that
if
you
get
a
recovery
against
the
government
you
cannot
sue
against
the
individual
employee,
which
recognizes
that
they
are
coexhisting
remedies
but
you
can't
get
double
recovery.
so
if
you
go
under
the
tort
claims
act,
you
are
precluded
from
going
against
the
individual
employee
which
imports
of
recognition
you
could
choose
either
one,
depending
on
what
you
thought
was
your
interest
in
terms
of
deterrence
and
compensation.
two
other
points
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
michael
e.
deutsch
all
right.
thank
you.
