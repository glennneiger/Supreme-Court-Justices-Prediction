chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
carlson
v.
green.
mr.
geller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geller,
perhaps
just
as
an
ex-midwesterner,
it
bothers
me
--
it
is
pronounced
terre
haute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
not
tort
claims
act
exclusive
in
the
sense
that
no
such
remedy
was
available
until
1946
when
the
act
was
passed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is,
against
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bivens
case
was
not
against
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
does
also,
as
you
told
us,
cover
negligence
actions,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it
is
not
but
it
does
--
it
is
brought
enough
to
encompass
and
certainly
does
encompass
negligence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was
the
query,
whether
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
eighth
amendment
would.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
it
is
questionable,
is
it
not,
whether
a
claim
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
would
recover
negligent
wrongs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
historically
hasn't
the
eighth
amendment
contemplated
intentional
cruel
and
unusual
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
when
mr.
justice
rehnquist
put
the
question
to
you,
that
you
conceded,
as
i
think
you
must,
that
the
complaint
covers
more
in
negligence
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
wrongful
death.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
survival
statute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
constitutional
claim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
this
common
law
of
survivorship
come
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that
there
is
some
deterrence
factor
that
if
this
were
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case
and
there
were
repeated
gross
negligence
shown
that
the
deterrent
would
be
the
discipline
and
perhaps
dismissal
of
all
the
people
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
must
be
aware
--
perhaps
you
are
not
--
that
sometimes
military
medical
men
have
been
dismissed
from
the
service
after
a
federal
tort
claims
case
disclosed
their
negligent
conduct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
spoken
three
or
four
times
about
its
being
equally
effective.
i
assume
you
mean
would
be
the
most
productive
in
terms
of
the
survivors,
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
a
practical
matter
--
and
i
suppose
this
is
anyone's
judgment
--
wouldn't
a
judgment
for,
say,
$50,000
against
the
united
states
government
be
worth
considerably
more
than
a
judgment
in
a
much
larger
amount
against
four
or
five
civil
servants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
many
statutes
produce
that
result,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
the
rights,
the
difference
between
the
constitutional
right
and
the
statutory
right
in
all
practical
terms
are
virtually
indistinguishable,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
deutsch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
was
a
great
deal
of
the
thrust
of
his
argument
this
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
mean,
he
never
alleged
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
he
was
referring
to
all
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
number
1261,
carlson
the
director
of
federal
prisons
against
green
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
