justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
settled
law
that
punitive
damages
may
not
be
included
in
computing
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
it
is
a
federal
tort
claims
action,
are
punitive
damages
allowable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
government
raise
this
point
before
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nor
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
presented
wouldn't
necessarily
lead
to
the
dismissal
of
the
writ
as
improperly
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
properly
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
page
13
of
the
appendix,
count
4,
apparently
paragraph
87
--
i
gather
all
of
the
paragraphs
have
been
reprinted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
"the
above
alleged
actions
of
the
defendants
were
of
a
malicious
and
intentional
nature
and
manifest
a
deliberate
indifference
of
requests
for
essential
treatment."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
many
courts
of
appeals
had
in
bivens
types
of
actions
looked
to
state
law
for
statutes
of
limitations
principles
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
isn't
peculiar
in
borrowing
state
law
when
it
is
necessary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
then
that
the
borrowing
under
a
bivens
type
of
a
claim,
say
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
you
necessarily
borrow
the
longest
possible
ones
because
that
"facilitates
the
claim,"
whereas
if
you
barrow
a
shorter
statute
of
limitation
it
is
"hostile"
to
the
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
hostile
to
your
constitutional
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
why
i
took
lord
campbell's
act
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
other,
judge
nolan
may
have
been
wrong
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
saying
that
you
look
to
state
law
for
survivorship
but
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
determining
the
elements
of
damage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
which
case
you
would
lose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
concede
that
judge
nolan
was
correct
if
in
indiana
law
applied
as
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
say
judge
nolan
was
wrong
as
of
indiana
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
better,
you
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
united
states
says
in
its
brief,
under
indiana
law
all
causes
of
action
survive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
in
the
solicitor
general's
office,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
the
survival
statute
would
have
to
enable
collateral
relatives
to
bring
the
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
or
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
do
you
say
it
would
also
have
to
permit
the
state
of
indiana
to
bring
it
under
the
law
of
escheat
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
suit
under
indiana
law
at
all?
let's
assume
the
man
hadn't
died,
would
you
have
a
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
that
your
own
client
ought
to
be
suable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
extend
it,
you
mean
extend
it
to
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
case
by
another
name,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
extending
it?
