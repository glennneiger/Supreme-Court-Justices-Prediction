justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
geller,
what
do
you
do
about
that
senate
committee
report,
or
do
i
just
misread
it,
as
recognizing
in
1974
certain
intentional
torts?
the
report
seems
to
think
that
it
just
adds
another
remedy
rather
than
eliminating
what
might
have
been
an
existing
bivens
--
justice
byron
r.
white
give
it
your
best
shot.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
it
was
a
kind
of
cause
of
action
that
you
say
the
senate
report
was
talking
about,
you
say
we
wouldn't
look
to
congressional
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
if
we
wanted
to
just
say,
sorry,
congress
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
federal
tort
claims
remedy
was
coextensive
with
whatever
constitutional
remedy
you
could
obtain,
would
you
think
that
would
be
a
factor
that
the
court
should
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
in
any
specific
case
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
should
be
implied?
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
the
tort
claims
act
is
exclusive.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
in
managing
a
judicially
created
cause
of
action
it
should
make
a
difference
whether
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
elsewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
elsewhere,
you
just
say
you
wouldn't
be
here
anyway,
you
wouldn't
be
wasting
your
time
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
suppose
you
hadn't
complied
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
comes
down
here
to
whether
or
not
the
differences
between
the
remedies
are
sufficient
that
the
constitutional
cause
of
action
should
exist
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
could
never
be
a
decent
remedy
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
deutsch,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
hostile
indiana
statute.
as
i
remember
it,
it
does
two
things.
it
says
the
claim
survives,
but
it
says
that
the
only
damages
that
can
be
recovered
are
burial
expenses
and
hospital
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
robertson
v.
wegmann?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
survival
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
concede
that
the
state
statute
of
limitations
would
be
governing,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
ever
been
a
holding
by
this
court
that
a
bivens
type
action
necessarily
requires
the
allowance
of
punitive
damages?
