now
you
may.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
geller,
before
you
do
that,
do
you
question
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
asking
whether
the
government
is
questioning
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
no
jurisdictional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
then
have
to
argue
or
do
you
that
punitive
damages
are
not
recoverable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
does
the
jurisdictional
issue
turn
on
the
indiana
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
so,
why
do
you
then
argue
that
--
why
don't
you
argue
that
first
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
we
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
if
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
just
trying
to
think
it
through
myself
frankly
whether
we
--
under
our
normal
practice
we
will
first
decide
jurisdiction
and
then
decide
cause
of
action,
i
suppose.
you
are
arguing
cause
of
action
first,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
second
argument
is
a
jurisdictional
argument
i
guess
is
really
what
i
am
asking
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
can
be
phrased
that
way,
but
do
you
phrase
it
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
presentation,
we
assume
for
purposes
of
reaching
the
cause
of
action
question
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
then
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
cause
of
action,
we
then
secondly
decide
whether
we
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
first
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
sue
the
government
there,
you
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suit
against
the
individual
is
barred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
respondent's
son
died
in
a
federal
prison,
allegedly
from
injuries
caused
by
federal
prison
officials
in
violation
of
his
son's
due
process,
equal
protection
and
eighth
amendment's
rights.
the
respondent
mother
sued
the
prison
officials,
seeking
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
on
behalf
of
her
son's
state
for
the
constitutional
violations.
nine
years
ago,
in
a
case
called
bivens
versus
federal
agents,
this
court
held
that
allegations
of
such
constitutional
violations
causing
injury
give
rise
to
a
direct
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
the
federal
officials
involved.
however,
it
also
happens
that
the
allegations
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states
itself
under
a
1971
amendment
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
the
government
argues
in
this
case
that
in
that
situation,
no
bivens
action
directly
under
the
constitution
against
the
federal
officials
should
be
permitted.
we
reject
that
argument.
agreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals,
an
eighth
amendment
violation
was
pleaded
by
the
respondent,
and
that
a
cause
of
action
was
stated
under
bivens,
we
hold
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendment
to
the
tort
claims
act
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
congress
views
that
tort
claims
act
and
the
bivens
action
as
parallel
complementary
causes
of
action.
in
other
words,
congress
contemplated
that
victims
of
the
kind
of
intentional
wrong
doing
alleged
in
this
complaint
shall
have
an
action
under
the
tort
claims
act
against
the
united
states
and
also
a
bivens
action
against
the
individual
officials
alleged
to
have
infringed
their
constitutional
rights.
there's
a
second
question
in
the
case,
namely
is
the
matter
of
the
survival
of
respondent's
bivens
action
to
be
decided
by
reference
to
state
law
here,
indiana
law.
the
government
concedes
that
federal
law
governs
that
argues
that
we
should
fashion
a
federal
rule
of
survivorship
that
incorporates
the
survivorship
laws
of
a
forum
state
here
indiana.
and
under
indiana
law,
the
action
would
abate
and
not
survive
and
could
not
be
maintained.
we
reject
the
suggestion.
we
hold
that
only
a
uniform
federal
rule
of
survivorship
was
compatible
with
a
goal
of
deterring
federal
officials
from
infringing
federal
constitutional
rights
and
the
manner
alleged
in
respondent's
complaint.
we
therefore
agree
with
and
affirm
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
"whenever
as
in
this
case,
the
relevants
states
survival
statute
would
abate
a
bivens
type
action
brought
against
defendants
whose
conduct
results
in
death,
the
federal
common
law
allows
survival
of
the
action."
