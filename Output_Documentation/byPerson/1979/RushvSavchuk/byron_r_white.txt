justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
he
doesn't
want
to
fight
with
you
because
he
has
just
heard
you
say
in
court
that
if
rush
doesn't
show
up
there
may
be
a
terrible
problem
of
enforcing
your
liability
on
the
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
basis
for
personal
jurisdiction
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
question
i
had
and
i
am
not
sure
i
quite
got
your
answer.
assume
the
company
goes
bankrupt,
can
you
enforce
the
judgment
against
the
individual?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
would
at
least
concede
that
they
couldn't
sue
them
on
that
judgment
for
over
the
$50,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
run
in
indiana
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
you
would
have
had
to
advise
your
client
to
sue
in
indiana,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
the
case
came
to
you,
the
statute
had
run
in
indiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
is
longer
in
minnesota?
