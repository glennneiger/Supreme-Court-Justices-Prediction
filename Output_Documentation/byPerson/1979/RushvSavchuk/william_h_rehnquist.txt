justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
judgment
that
may
be
entered
against
him
is
not
a
personal
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
were
relying
on
housley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
is
a
different
question
though
i
think
whether
they
can
--
if
they
started
an
independent
action,
a
new
action
in
indiana
and
relying
on
park
lane
or
some
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
but
they
couldn't
rely
--
just
take
this
judgment
in
indiana
and
sue
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
but
that
would
be
in
a
new
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
this
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
worth
any
more
in
indiana?
is
that
judgment
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
say
you
started
a
suit
on
that
judgment
in
indiana,
like
you
normally
would
to
collect
a
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
the
minnesota
court
under
its
present
decision
after
the
remand
under
shaffer
say
that
a
resident
of
minnesota
can
sue
a
defendant
in
any
other
state
anywhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i
am
curious
about
is
does
minnesota
law
require
any
contacts
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
with
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
through
his
insurer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
that's
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
pre-shaffer
that
this
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
harris
v.
balk
he
would.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
the
defendant
as
an
individual
had
no
contact
with
the
forum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
isn't
it
something
of
an
over-simplification
to
say
that
the
insurance
company
comes
in
and
calls
the
shots,
with
the
duty
to
settle,
the
duty
to
cooperate
and
so
forth?
there
is
a
constant
possibility
of
an
adverse
relationship
developing
between
the
insured
and
the
insurance
company.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
never
run
into
a
case
where
the
defendant
individually
hired
his
own
lawyer
because
he
felt
the
insurance
company
was
refusing
a
reasonable
offer
of
settlement
and
insisted
that
the
insurance
company
settle,
where
the
insurance
company
is
unwilling
to
settle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
were
uninsured,
you
would
have
no
risk
in
minnesota
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
wasn't
asking
whether
you
would
take
the
case.
we
were
talking
about
risk,
the
defendant's
risk.
if
he
had
never
entered
the
state
of
minnesota,
all
the
physical
action
takes
place
in
indiana,
he
could
be
uninsured
and
still
have
no
risk
in
minnesota.
