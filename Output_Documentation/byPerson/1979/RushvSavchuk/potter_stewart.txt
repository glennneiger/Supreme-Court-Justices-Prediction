justice
potter
stewart
by
what?
justice
potter
stewart
misunderstanding.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
suppose
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
he
said
i
am
simply
not
going
to
go
up
to
minnesota
and
if
you
want
to
terminate
your
coverage,
go
ahead
and
terminate
it,
and
they
terminate
the
coverage.
then
there
is
no
longer
a
basis
for
a
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
your
mind
that
the
minnesota
court
was
wrong
in
this
case
either,
as
you
submitted
it
to
us,
but
what
do
you
think
the
minnesota
courts
would
hold?
the
courts
have
held
that
they
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
mr.
rush
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
limits
of
liability
on
the
insurance
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
to
enter
a
judgment
against
him.
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
enter
a
judgment
against
him
to
the
extent
of
the
limits
of
liability
of
the
liability
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
it
might
follow
in
view
of
the
minnesota
court
that
the
minnesota
court
had
the
power
to
punish
him
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
obey
a
subpena?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
think
there
is
no
basis
for
the
minnesota
court
opinion
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
more
than
a
notice
and
a
request.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
penalty
is
a
default
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
in
a
sense
that
it
would
--
the
judgment
entered
would
not
be
enforceable
against
him
in
another
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
say
a
judgment
is
entered
and
the
person
who
gets
the
judgment
prefers
to
enforce
it
in
indiana,
against
him
personally.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
is
after
a
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
never
shown
up.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
race
is
now
the
security.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
suggest
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
adamson,
where
do
you
suppose
the
limitation
imposed
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
that
this
procedure
is
available
only
to
residents
of
the
forum
state
came
from?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
by
residence,
by
being
domiciled
there.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
sufficient
contacts,
as
you
are
submitting,
has
to
do
with
the
defendant
and
not
the
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
the
minnesota
result.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
adamson,
on
the
shaffer
point,
suppose
that
instead
of
an
insurance
policy
the
defendant
had
a
bank
account
over
the
years
and
just
kept
$50,000
in
the
state
and
had
no
other
contact
with
the
state,
would
you
say
that
under
shaffer
the
plaintiff
could
get
jurisdiction,
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
of
$50,000?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
would
be
a
chance
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
borkon,
do
you
agree
that
if
the
insurance
company
should
go
bankrupt
you
could
not
--
assume
you
got
a
$50,000
which
i
guess
is
the
policy
limit,
you
could
not
collect
the
judgment
from
the
defendant
individually?
justice
potter
stewart
the
quasi
in
rem.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
also
agree
that
the
individual
defendant
should
defy
any
court
order
and
not
risk
contempt
if
he
just
didn't
show
up
and
just
didn't
respond
to
any
notice
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
got
a
judgment
for
a
million
dollars
in
minnesota
and
the
policy
limits
were
$50,000,
you
couldn't
enforce
the
million
dollar
judgment
personally
against
the
defendant
in
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
you
haven't
agreed
not
to
use
this
judgment
as
binding
on
him
in
a
separate
suit
in
indiana.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
in
minnesota,
but
what
if
you
went
to
--
have
you
agreed
not
to
sue
him
for
anything
in
addition
in
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
now,
but
when
you
instituted
the
first
action.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
statute
in
minnesota
was
longer
in
a
personal
injury
case
than
it
is
in
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
you
have
the
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence
rather
than
contributory
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
true
about
all
in
rem
and
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
if
the
defendant
doesn't
own
real
or
personal
property
in
the
jurisdiction,
there
cannot
be
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
an
obligation
to
pay,
a
conditional
obligation
to
pay.
