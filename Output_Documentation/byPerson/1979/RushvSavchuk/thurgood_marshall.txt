justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
can
find
a
state
with
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
you
can
file
another
suit
now,
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
he
is
in
pennsylvania?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
also
a
favorable
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
the
state
of
minnesota's
law
apply
to
this
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
are
really
saying
is
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
was
an
accident
or
not,
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
get
what
you
mean.
you
mean
the
shaffer
case
as
construed
by
the
minnesota
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
now
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
the
question
is
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
exercise
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
a
defendant
who
has
no
forum
contacts
by
attaching
the
contractual
obligation
of
an
insurer
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
state
to
defend
and
indemnify
him
in
connection
with
that
suit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
hold
that
the
policy
obligation
without
more
does
not
establish
a
sufficient
relationship
among
the
defendant,
the
forum,
and
the
litigation
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
due
process.
appellee
was
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
in
indiana
while
riding
in
a
car
driven
by
the
appellant.
both
the
appellant
and
appellee
were
indiana
residents.
after
moving
to
minnesota,
appellee
commenced
this
negligence
action
in
a
minnesota
state
court
attempting
to
obtain
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
by
garnishing
the
contractual
obligation
of
appellant's
insurance
company,
to
which
company
does
business
in
minnesota,
to
defend
and
indemnify
him
in
connection
with
the
suit.
the
trial
court
denied
appellant's
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
affirmed.
now,
a
state
may
exercise
jurisdiction
over
an
absent
defendant
only
if
he
has
certain
minimum
contacts
with
the
state
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
due
process.
the
fact
that
appellant's
insurance
company
does
business
in
the
state
suggest
no
further
contacts
among
appellant,
the
forum,
and
this
lawsuit
that
would
make
it
fair
just
and
reasonable
for
the
state
to
determine
his
liability
for
the
out-of-state
accident.
the
necessity
of
establishing
minimum
contacts
between
the
defendant
and
the
forum
cannot
be
avoided
by
considering
the
attachment
procedure
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
direct
action
against
the
insurer.
if
the
constitution
forbids
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
the
insured
based
on
the
policy,
there
is
no
conceptual
basis
for
bringing
the
insurance
company
into
the
action
as
a
garnishee.
because
appellant
has
no
contacts,
ties,
or
relations
with
minnesota,
the
state's
decision
of
jurisdiction
is
inconsistent
with
the
due
process
clause.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
