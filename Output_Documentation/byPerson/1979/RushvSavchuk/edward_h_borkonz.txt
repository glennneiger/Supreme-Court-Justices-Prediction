mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
are
simple
in
this
case
as
far
as
how
the
accident
happened
and
where
it
occurred,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
minnesota
was
doing
after
seider
v.
roth
and
that
type
of
case
started
out
of
new
york,
which
had
to
do
with
automobiles
and
automobile
liability
insurance.
in
1969,
minnesota
realized
that
in
order
to
provide
a
forum
for
its
residents,
through
the
legislation
they
did
pass
the
garnishment
statute,
the
571.41,
adding
subdivision
2,
where
they
definitely
had
in
mind
this
type
of
case,
such
as
savchuk
v.
rush.
they
felt
there
where
there
would
be
a
policy
of
insurance
between
a
defendant
and
the
insurance
company,
where
the
defendant
had
proper
notice
and
the
plaintiff
was
a
resident
of
the
forum
or
of
minnesota,
he
could
then
bring
the
action.
they
even
used
terms,
as
the
court
knows,
judgment,
debtor
and
defendant.
following
that
statute,
the
first
time
i
believe
that
minnesota
actually
looked
at
the
statute
was
in
judge
neville's
opinion
in
the
rintalla
case,
and
i
think
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
here,
is
judge
neville
--
and
we
are
right
in
line
with
the
shaffer
case
as
far
as
saying
fundamental
fairness
and
contacts
--
that
really
is
the
defendant
getting
due
process
under
the
statute
and
he
looked
at
it
and
said,
yes,
because
the
insurance
company
and
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
are
actually
--
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
them
in
the
transaction,
the
automobile
accident.
you
can't
just
isolate
it
on
the
defendant
such
as
we
have
in
the
shaffer
case.
judge
neville
then
felt
that
the
statute
was
constitutional,
they
have
applied
it
and
they
have
applied
it
in
minnesota
over
the
last
ten
years.
so
when
savchuk
moved
to
minnesota,
actually
his
father
was
transferred
to
minnesota.
some
year
or
so
later
he
moved
after
the
accident,
we
received
the
case
in
our
office.
actually,
the
forum
in
indiana,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
and,
of
course,
the
minnesota
statute
has
run
now
because
in
1974,
when
we
obtained
the
garnishment
and
this
procedure
started,
state
farm
and
along
with
its
defendant
through
the
policy
has
been
bringing
it
before
the
court.
now,
the
important
part
of
the
decisions
in
minnesota
and
what
we
look
to
is
the
fact
of
the
insurance
company
is
the
real
interest,
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case.
there
is
no
question
that
from
the
time
that
the
accident
happened,
albeit
in
indiana,
the
insurance
company
then
comes
in
and
calls
the
shots,
if
you
please,
from
then
on.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
maybe
the
choice
of
words,
"calling
the
shots,"
is
incorrect
to
use
that
term,
but
the
plaintiff
after
the
automobile
accident
occurred
and
the
defendant
gives
notice
through
his
insurance
carrier
from
that
time
on,
myself
or
as
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
would
then
only
contact
--
the
only
contact
we
have
is
the
attorney
really
for
the
insurance
company,
even
though
he
is
representing
the
defendant
through
the
policy.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
settlement
discussions,
it
is
going
to
be
with
the
insurance
company,
and
if
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
settle,
it
is
the
insurance
company,
they
select
the
counsel
they
are
going
to
use
to
defend,
they
tell
when
it
is
going
to
be
settled,
they
say
whether
or
not
it
is
going
to
court,
the
defendant,
especially
in
minnesota,
where
the
statute
and
the
cases
in
the
supreme
court
have
stated,
only
the
$50,000
limit
is
involved.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
yes,
in
bad
faith.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
too.
here
i
think
that
is
why
the
minnesota
court,
the
supreme
court
and
also
the
federal
decisions,
of
which
there
are
three
in
minnesota,
have
all
stated
that
that
will
comply
with
the
minimum
contacts
and
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
because
you
are
limiting
it
to
the
$50,000,
you
are
giving
them
notice
to
come
in
to
defend,
but
it
is
this
relationship
that
is
so
close
between
an
insurance
company
and
the
defendant.
in
shaffer
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
had
been
a
what?
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
it
is
to
get
jurisdiction
is
proper
because
the
insurance
company
is
the
one
doing
business
in
minnesota.
that
is
the
number
one
insurance
carrier
writing
liability
insurance
in
minnesota.
so
we
look
to
get
jurisdiction
in
minnesota
for
the
resident
of
minnesota,
so
we
would
look
to
bring
him
into
the
forum
where
the
insurance
company
is
doing
business,
controlled
by
the
state
of
minnesota,
they
have
their
benefits,
the
insurance
company
is
in
minnesota,
they
can
be
regulated
by
minnesota,
and
we
would
look
to
the
insurance
company
to
the
extent
of
the
policy
for
the
defendant.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
if
there
would
be
unlimited
resources,
depending
on
his
injuries.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
right.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
i
would
agree
with
that
because
of
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
--
the
quasi
in
rem
is
the
race
of
the
insurance
policy
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
have
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
policy
limits
by
stipulation
following
judge
neville's
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
we
have.
we
have
agreed
that
this
will
be
our
lawsuit
of
$50,000
and
that
is
all.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
it
was
sued
and
then
it
was
amended
to
bring
it
within
the
$50,000.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
it
was
$125,000
plus
the
110
following
the
garnishment
statute.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
then
after
state
farm
answered
the
supplemental
--
well,
first
they
answered
that
they
owed
no
doubt.
then
under
another
statute
in
that
same
chapter
we
brought
them
into
a
lawsuit
on
a
supplemental
complaint,
then
we
agreed
to
limit
our
lawsuit
to
$50,000
and
that
pretty
much
now
is
the
minnesota
law.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
we
stipulated
following
the
minnesota
law
that
we
would
have
to
agree
to
the
$50,000
judgment
in
minnesota
and
that
you
wouldn't
be
suing
him.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
it
is
because
we
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
we
have
agreed
to
it
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
they
both
have
run
now,
of
course,
but
we
don't
know
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
the
statute
has
run
in
minnesota
as
well.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
the
statute
in
minnesota
had
not
run.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
six
years
in
minnesota
and
two
years
in
indiana.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
don't
have
the
guest
statute.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
we
are
saying
that
at
least
from
our
viewpoint
that
we
would
only
take
a
case
where
our
plaintiff
is
a
legitimate
resident
of
minnesota.
he
did
live
there
for
some
five
years.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
he
was
there
five
years
afterwards,
plus
it
is
at
the
time
he
brings
the
lawsuit
and
i
think
in
this
day
and
age,
a
wholesome
young
man
that
had
business
opportunity
elsewhere
than
in
minnesota.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
if
he
knew
that
because
we
didn't
have
the
case
when
he
moved
and
for
sometime
afterwards.
but
it
is
for
those
reasons
that
i
think
is
different
from
the
shaffer
case
where
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
through
the
insurance
company.
we
feel
that
in
shaffer,
where
the
stock
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
underlying
action
or
the
litigation
whatsoever,
and
here
we
have
an
interest.
here
i
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
i
am
saying
that
minnesota
could
follow
the
shaffer
case
with
no
problem
because
it
is
a
particular
statute
that
the
minnesota
courts
or
the
legislature
at
first
recognized
and
said
when
it
comes
to
automobiles
and
automobile
liability
insurance,
this
will
be
the
law,
and
we
can
still
follow
shaffer
and
international
shoe
because
they
are
looking
at
the
cases
in
minnesota
and
saying
that
the
minimum
contacts
have
been
met,
that
you
can't
take
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
i
think
the
medical
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
it
could
be
for
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
minnesota
would
allow
them
to
write
insurance,
state
farm,
possibly
on
that
kind
of
grounds.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
it
probably
would.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
plus
i
don't
think
you
can
leave
out
the
plaintiff.
we
realized
that
under
the
shaffer
case
you
are
looking
to
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
correct.
but
the
main
purpose
for
obviously
having
liability
insurance
is
not
only
to
cover
yourself
but
if
you
have
to
answer
to
damages
to
someone
else.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
he
has
no
risk
in
this
case
because
he
is
not
going
to
give
up
anything.
the
insurance
company
is
the
only
one
possible
that
is
going
to
give
anything
up.
the
defendant
will
give
up
nothing.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
well,
you
would
have
no
risk
but
to
say
that
we
--
it
is
rare
if
at
all
that
we
would
take
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
uninsured.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
true.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
it
was
the
insurance
policy
but
we
feel
that
is
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
the
federal
court
through
minnesota
has
interpreted
that
it
is
the
insurance
policy
and
the
contact
that
it
has
with
its
own
defendant,
that
that
is
different
or
unique,
what
have
you,
but
still
you
can
apply
shaffer
v.
heitner
and
international
shoe
and
that
is
being
fair
to
the
defendant,
but
you
can't
isolate
the
defendant
from
his
insurance
company.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
right.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
no,
they
never
denied
that.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
is
a
different
obligation
to
defend
and
there
is
an
obligation
to
pay
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
there,
so
it
takes
away
from
the
contingency
that
mr.
justice
stevens
talked
about.
in
fact,
in
minnesota
you
even
have
interrogatories
that
can
find
out
the
policy
limits
for
what
you
are
dealing
with,
and
at
least
in
90
percent
of
the
cases,
as
least
in
minnesota,
mr.
adamson
and
his
firm
will
be
on
that
case
if
state
farm
insurance
is
the
policy
writer
for
the
insured.
still,
they
have
the
forum
for
non-convenience
statute
as
far
as
if
the
court
feels
more
witnesses
are
located
in
a
different
area.
i
would
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
has.
mr.
edward
h.
borkonz
thank
you.
