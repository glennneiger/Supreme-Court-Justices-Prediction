mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
issue
presented
by
this
appeal
succinctly
stated
is
whether
or
not
the
minnesota
courts
may
exercise
constitutionally
permissible
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
a
non-resident
tortfeasor
who
has
absolutely
no
minimum
contacts
whatsoever
with
the
state
of
minnesota
by
permitting
the
plaintiff
to
garnish
the
defendant's
liability
insurance
policy
on
the
basis
that
the
defendant's
insurer
does
business
within
the
state
of
minnesota.
that
is
the
issue
presented
by
this
appeal.
the
operative
facts
are
very
simple
but
they
provide
i
think
the
necessary
background.
back
in
1972,
mr.
rush
and
mr.
savchuk
were
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
in
indiana.
at
that
time,
both
mr.
rush
and
mr.
savchuk
were
residents
and
citizens
of
the
state
of
indiana.
about
a
year
and
a
half
later
mr.
savchuk
decides
to
emigrate
to
minnesota
and
about
a
year
after
that
he
commenced
this
lawsuit
against
mr.
rush
by
serving
a
garnishment
summons
on
state
farm,
mr.
rush's
liability
insurer
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
i
might
say
that
mr.
rush's
liability
insurers,
state
farm,
is
his
liability
insurer
by
reason
of
a
contract
of
insurance
which
was
written
and
issued
in
the
state
of
indiana.
there
was
no
point
of
contact
with
any
of
these
activities
at
all
until
mr.
savchuk's
going
to
minnesota
and
then
commencing
this
action.
as
soon
as
this
was
done,
rush
and
state
farm
immediately
challenged
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
the
garnishment
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
by
appropriate
motion
and
the
minnesota
district
court
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
found
no
due
process
problems
whatsoever
with
the
procedure.
we
then
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
remanded
it
back
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court
with
directions
to
reconsider
their
prior
determination
in
light
of
shaffer
v.
heitner.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
duly
reconsidered
the
matter
and
found
no
problem
whatsoever
with
the
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
felt
that
shaffer
v.
heitner
did
not
change
a
thing.
this
second
appeal
followed
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
now,
before
talking
about
shaffer
a
little
bit,
i
would
like
to
express
to
the
court
my
understanding
of
the
reasoning
followed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
ignoring
shaffer.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
by
ignoring,
i
say.
maybe
that
is
an
inappropriate
word
--
distinguishing
it.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
would
like
to
use
that
word,
yes,
sir.
first
of
all
--
and
i
think
this
is
rather
interesting
--
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
after
talking
about
the
facts
in
shaffer,
said
that
it
considered
the
decision
unclear.
it
also
said
that
minnesota's
interest
in
facilitating
recoveries
for
resident
plaintiffs
--
notice
that
language,
facilitating
recoveries
for
resident
plaintiffs
--
not
only
requires
a
local
forum
in
minnesota
but
may
override
traditional
choice
of
law
analysis.
now,
it
may
be
there
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
mixing
jurisdiction
and
choice
of
law
which
we
all
have
so
much
trouble
with,
but
at
any
rate
that
is
what
it
said.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
went
on
to
say
that
minnesota
possesses
sufficient
contacts
--
without
identifying
them
--
and
that
due
process
is
not
violated
in
this
quasi
in
rem
action
because
of
three
things,
and
here
they
are.
one,
notice
was
given
to
the
defendant,
it
sure
was.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
two,
the
defendant
cannot
be
held
liable
for
more
than
his
policy
limits
in
minnesota
pursuant
to
this
quasi
in
rem
proceeding.
and
three,
the
procedure
is
available
only
to
minnesota
residents
and
it
is
not
available
to
non-residents,
it
is
available
to
only
minnesota
residents.
now,
these
are
the
three
bases
which
the
minnesota
supreme
court
enunciated
as
providing
the
due
process
basis
for
this
quasi
in
rem
proceeding
that
i
have
described.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
he
has
emigrated
again
to
pennsylvania
so
that
means
i
think
he
has
lived
in
three
states
in
six
years.
probably
that
isn't
material,
but
it
does
illustrate
how
fluid
our
population
is
when
we
are
trying
to
arrive
at
a
constitutional
nexus
based
upon
the
transitory
residence
of
a
plaintiff
in
a
given
state
at
a
given
time.
now,
that
isn't
all
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did.
i
think
it
added
the
frosting
on
the
cake
really
because
after
having
reasoned
all
of
this
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
due
process
was
satisfied,
it
really
gave
the
coup
de
grace
to
mr.
rush.
it
said
that
in
this
situation
where
minnesota
requires
jurisdiction
of
an
out-of-state
accident
over
a
non-resident
and
so
forth,
it
will
apply
minnesota
substantive
law
--
"we
are
not
a
choice
of
law."
they
found
that
not
only
do
we
have
jurisdiction
but
the
choice
of
law
decision
we
are
going
to
make,
we
are
going
to
apply
minnesota
law
to
this
accident
because
it
is
more
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
the
consequences
in
this
particular
case
is,
your
honors,
that
by
so
doing
the
minnesota
supreme
court
would
strip
from
mr.
rush
what
is
basically
an
absolute
defense,
the
guest
statute
of
indiana
which
was
certainly
applicable
to
him
and
mr.
savchuk
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
and
also
would
substitute
a
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence
for
contributory
negligence
and
also
would
prevent
this
action
from
being
dismissed
by
reason
of
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
all
of
these
things
mr.
savchuk
got
by
being
able
to
invoke
the
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
now
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
the
vote
was
6-3,
mr.
justice
otis
dissenting,
and
madam
justice
wahl
writing
the
majority
opinion.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
sir,
minnesota
has
never
had
a
guest
statute.
minnesota
abhors
guest
statutes,
the
judiciary
does.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
we
do
not
have
a
direct
action
statute.
i
believe
only
two
or
three
states,
louisiana
and
wisconsin
do,
but
minnesota
does
not.
now,
of
course,
in
the
last
analysis,
shaffer
v.
heitner
is
going
to
mean
what
this
court
tell
us
what
it
means,
but
our
understanding
of
the
teaching
of
shaffer
v.
heitner
is
very
simple
and
very,
very
easy
to
comprehend.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
minnesota
supreme
court
about
the
lack
of
clarity
of
the
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
heart
of
shaffer
comes
right
out
and
says
that
the
standard
for
determining
whether
the
exercise
of
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
is
consistent
with
due
process
is
the
minimum
contact
standard
enunciated
in
international
shoe.
and
you
look
to
international
shoe
and
you
find
out
what
are
those
minimal
contacts.
they
are
the
relationship
among
the
defendant,
the
forum
and
the
litigation.
if
you
applied
that
yardstick
to
the
instant
case,
you
would
find
two
things
immediately,
and
there
can't
be
any
argument
about
it,
none
whatsoever.
there
is
absolutely
no
contact
whatsoever
between
defendant
rush
over
in
indiana
and
the
state
of
minnesota,
none.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
to
my
understanding
relationship
between
the
litigation
and
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
only
state
in
the
union
that
has
any
meaningful
contact
with
this
litigation
would
be
the
state
of
indiana,
where
everything
happened,
where
mr.
savchuk
was
allegedly
injured
and
where
he
was
made
well.
thus,
if
you
read
shaffer
as
i
have
and
read
international
shoe
as
i
have
just
done,
that
is
the
end
of
it,
there
is
no
due
process
here
on
this
quasi
in
rem
basis.
now,
the
minnesota
court
took
a
somewhat
different
view
about
these
things.
the
minnesota
court
first
of
all
completely
ignored
the
lack
of
relationship
between
the
forum
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and
the
litigation.
it
snubbed
that
matter
completely.
instead
of
that,
it
placed
its
primary
emphasis
not
on
the
defendant
but
upon
the
residency
of
the
plaintiff.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
of
minnesota
has
an
understandably
strong
public
policy
as
enunciated
by
its
courts
to
provide
its
residents
with
a
forum,
but
that
policy
does
not
establish
due
process.
it
almost
begs
the
question.
assuming
such
policy,
you
nevertheless
must
ask
the
question
does
effecting
that
policy
in
this
particular
matter
violate
or
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
in
two
parts.
i
do
consider
mr.
rush
morally
and
ethically
my
client
as
well
as
the
insurance
company.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
the
economic
problem
--
this
is
what
would
transpire
if
jurisdiction
were
allowed
in
this
case
and
mr.
rush
would
refuse
to
cooperate
in
his
defense.
i
think
that
is
the
way
we
would
put
it
and
so
forth,
and
a
default
judgment
would
be
entered
against
him.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
but
if
mr.
rush
were
to
avail
himself
of
that
privilege
of
not
cooperating
with
his
insurance
company
and
what
have
you
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
--
there
would
be
quite
a
problem
about
enforcing
that
judgment
against
the
insurance
company
because
of
his
breach
of
the
insurance
contract
of
cooperation.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
of
course,
a
termination
of
coverage
as
of
the
time
mr.
rush
told
state
farm
he
didn't
want
any
more
to
do
with
it
would
not
affect
the
period
of
time
when
there
was
coverage
at
which
time
the
accident
had
happened.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
even
if
he
breaches
his
obligation
to
cooperate,
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
that
period
is
very
brief,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
he
could
not
be.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
they
have
held
that
they
have
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
mr.
rush
to
the
extent
of
the
liability
policy.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
there
is
no
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
this
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes.
and
then
the
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
do
not.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
there
is
just
no
basis
for
it.
this
is
a
civil
action
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
want
to
answer
your
specific
question
without
getting
off
on
this
tangent
here.
this
is
a
civil
action.
there
is
no
process
in
the
state
of
minnesota
that
can
require
mr.
savchuk
to
come
there
and
testify.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
they
can
request
him
but
they
can't
subpena
him
because
of
the
limitations
of
the
state
lines.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
default
judgment,
a
civil
penalty
which
is
imposed
in
that
way
but
not
to
put
him
in
jail
or
fine
him
or
do
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
if
we
are
talking
about
a
default
judgment,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
if
we
are
talking
about
a
judgment
as
a
result
of
this
case
being
litigated,
i
am
not
so
sure.
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
mr.
justice
white,
is
this
a
default
judgment
or
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
it
is
an
adversary
judgment.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
all
right.
well,
of
course,
i
don't
know
why
my
friend
over
here
would
do
such
a
thing
when
he
has
got
the
insurance
company
right
there
in
minnesota,
why
would
he
want
to
run
off
to
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
but
the
point
that
you
raise
that
hadn't
occurred
to
me,
i
suppose
if
state
farm
went
bankrupt
in
the
interim
he
might
go
to
indiana
looking
for
mr.
rush.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
there
isn't
any,
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
don't
know.
you
might
well
try.
it
is
a
quasi
in
rem,
but
the
assets
supposedly
are
the
policy
and
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
the
race
is
the
policy
so
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
work.
but
we
are
off
on
this,
and
this
is
another
--
you
are
touching,
the
court
is
touching
on
an
area
which
is
very
disturbing
to
us
and
that
is,
while
minnesota
says,
look,
we
will
not
enforce
this
judgment
against
mr.
rush
--
the
jury
had
come
in
for
a
million
dollars,
the
policy
is
$50,000
--
we
will
not
enforce
this
judgment
here
in
minnesota
for
more
than
$50,000.
now,
that
is
all
very
nice
because
that
is
the
amount
of
the
insurance
policy.
what
is
to
prevent
somebody
suing
mr.
rush
anew
some
place
else
so
they
can
get
some
basis
of
jurisdiction?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
don't
know.
suppose
it
is
a
million
dollar
judgment?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
he
goes
over
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
he
goes
over
to
north
dakota
and
he
says
i
have
a
deficiency
and
you
have
a
gold
mine
over
here.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
you've
had
your
day
in
court
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
would
start
a
brand
new
action
and
seek
collateral
estoppel
against
him
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
--
and
say
you
have
had
your
day
in
court
and
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
sir,
it
would.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
this
judgment
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
the
minnesota
judgment
in
minnesota
is
worth
$50,000
and
no
more.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
he
shouldn't
be
able
to,
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
because
of
the
very,
shall
we
say,
unusual
jurisdictional
basis
that
we
have
here
to
begin
with.
if
we
were
playing
a
true
quasi
in
rem
ball
game,
the
answer
to
these
questions
would
be
all
very
easy.
obviously,
a
quasi
in
rem
judgment
isn't
good
for
anything
more
than
the
asset
which
comprises
the
race,
and
that
is
all
you've
got
to
use
to
liquidate
your
judgment.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
well,
if
he
had
commenced
the
lawsuit
in
indiana
prior
to
the
running
of
the
indiana
statute
of
limitations,
of
course
it
would
change
the
situation
and
he
would
have
a
valid
in
personam
action
going
for
him
in
indiana
and
he
wouldn't
need
a
quasi
in
rem
proceeding
in
minnesota
at
all.
but
after
the
indiana
statute
of
limitations
has
run,
he
is
foreclosed
from
doing
that.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
again,
since
there
is
no
determinations
by
any
court
in
this
area,
i
would
be
just
giving
you
my
expert
opinion.
i
would
think
that
the
minnesota
court
under
those
circumstances
would
give
comity
to
the
indiana
action
which
was
an
in
personam
thing
and
hold
their
quasi
in
rem
action
in
abeyance
until
the
indiana
action
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
no
one
knows
what
the
minnesota
courts
would
do
in
that
area.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
they
told
us
in
their
opinion
--
i
think
it
was
the
first
subject
opinion,
where
chief
justice
sheran
made
it
clear
that
without
the
plaintiff's
connection
--
we
are
using
international
shoe
language
now
--
without
plaintiff's
connection
to
the
state
of
minnesota,
minnesota
was
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
that's
right,
by
being
a
resident
citizen
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
without
plaintiff's
connection
with
the
state
of
minnesota,
minnesota
would
lack
sufficient
contacts
with
the
suit
to
justify
jurisdiction.
this
is
what
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
to
predicate
the
constitutional
basis
of
this
doctrine
on
the
residency
of
plaintiffs
and
saying
it
is
not
available
to
non-residents
raises
another
horrible
constitutional
problem
and
that
is
a
denial
of
non-residence
for
the
right
of
citizenship
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
courts
are
closed
to
them
as
far
as
this
is
concerned.
again,
this
is
not
before
the
court,
but
it
illustrates
the
problems
we
get
into
when
we
try
to
i
think
emasculate
the
shaffer
decision
and
go
down
this
line.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
both
of
its
decisions
held
that
a
resident
may
sue
a
non-resident
involving
any
tort
which
occurred
anywhere
in
the
world
providing
he
can
get
garnishment
jurisdiction
over
the
insurance
company
within
the
state
of
minnesota.
i
believe
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
none
whatsoever.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
except
through
the
vehicle
of
the
fact
that
the
happenstance
that
his
insurer
happens
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
that's
it.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
that's
right,
and
to
pay
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
but
the
point
is,
your
honors,
that
as
in
shaffer,
the
insurance
contract
itself
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation.
there
is
no
quarrel
about
it.
it
is
not
even
a
minnesota
contract.
it
is
there
just
as
the
stock
would
have
been
in
shaffer
to
satisfy
a
judgment
rendered
against
those
shareholders
and
directors.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
let
me
live
dangerously
and
suggest
a
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
we
change
one
fact
in
shaffer.
suppose
instead
of
corporate
stock,
the
plaintiff
in
shaffer
had
garnished
in
delaware,
an
officers
and
directors
liability
insurance
policy
issued
by
some
company
out
in
oregon
or
california
and
written
by
a
company
that
happened
to
do
business
in
delaware.
i
cannot
reach
shaffer
as
coming
to
an
obvious
result
if
that
had
been
the
case.
nobody
was
fighting
about
that
insurance
policy.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
which
would
have
been
all
right?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
well,
we
were
contending
that
it
was
the
wrong
--
before
this
court
had
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
well,
the
reason
we
are
depending
so
on
shaffer
is
that,
of
course,
it
is
an
utterance
of
the
highest
court
in
this
land
in
a
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
case
and
it
carries
extreme
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
oh,
you
mean
is
the
doctrine
of
seider
v.
roth
what
we
are
talking
about,
now
the
minnesota
garnishment
rule
and
what
have
you,
is
that
a
bad
thing
before
shaffer?
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
it
certainly
was.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
i
would
say
under
international
shoe
the
trend
of
the
case
law,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
so
clearly
pointed
out,
was
all
going
in
this
direction
with
this
mechanical
--
you
see,
up
until
shaffer
the
underpinning
of
all
of
these
seider
v.
roth
cases
was
harris
v.
balk,
just
that
naked
power
over
the
property
in
the
state.
that
is
all
you
had
to
have,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said.
that
is
all
you
had
to
have,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said.
and
that
was
what
was
shot
down
in
shaffer,
but
i
think
it
was
bad
before
and
it
certainly
is
bad
now
in
our
judgment.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
under
shaffer,
if
the
bank
account
had
nothing
to
do
wish
this
litigation,
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
acquire
jurisdiction
and
to
collect
the
judgment
--
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
--
under
shaffer
he
would
have
no
right
to
garnish
that
bank
account,
none
whatsoever,
as
i
understand
shaffer.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
yes,
sir,
most
definitely.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
oscar
c.
adamson,
ii
very
briefly,
i
have
listened
to
my
friend
and
i
have
not
heard
him
touch
at
all
upon
what
is,
of
course,
the
keystone
language
i
believe
is
the
shaffer
opinion,
and
that
language
is
if
a
direct
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
would
violate
the
constitution,
it
would
seem
that
an
indirect
assertion
of
the
jurisdiction
should
be
equally
impermissible.
we
have
an
attempt
for
an
indirect
assertion
of
jurisdiction
here
and
to
me
it
seems
that
it
would
be
equally
impermissible
and
therefore
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed
and
that
the
matter
be
remanded
for
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
dismissal.
