justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
adamson,
i
assume
--
maybe
i
should
not
--
that
your
principal
client
is
the
insurance
company
rather
than
the
individual
and
there
could
be
a
conflict
i
suppose
here.
what
i
wanted
to
know
though
is
assume
that
the
individual
involved
here
felt
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
he
had
no
contact
with
minnesota
and
he
didn't
care
what
the
minnesota
judge
said,
he
just
wasn't
going
to
go
up
there
and
testify.
he
lives
in
indiana,
he
wanted
to
stay
home.
could
the
minnesota
judge
hold
him
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
respond
to
a
notice
to
appear
and
testify
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
policy
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
could
not
be
held
in
contempt
of
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
suit
against
the
insurance
company
on
the
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
insurance
company
could
sue
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
not
extinguish
their
duty
to
defend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
a
duty
to
defend
even
if
he
breaches
his
obligation
to
cooperate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
then
still
have
the
duty
to
defend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
he
could
do
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
you
would
agree
that
he
could
not
personally
be
subjected
to
any
discipline
or
any
court
order
by
the
judge
in
minnesota.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
million
dollar
judgment
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
is
not
just
some
chance
property,
something
that
is
actually
bought
to
defend
him
against
suits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
nobody
bought
the
stock
in
order
to
provide
for
--
in
order
to
provide
a
way
to
respond
to
litigation,
but
that
is
what
this
insurance
policy
was
bought
for,
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
did
you
agree
not
to
sue
for
more
in
indiana
if
--
let's
assume
you
got
your
$50,000
judgment
in
minnesota.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
in
what
form
did
you
agree
not
to
sue
for
more
in
indiana
in
a
separate
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
is
that
the
consequence
of
your
stipulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
because
you
can
only
collect
$50,000
in
minnesota,
why
does
that
mean
that
you
are
barred
from
suing
for
the
balance
of
what
you
claim
your
injury
was
in
indiana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case
you
aren't
giving
up
anything
because
the
statute
had
run
in
indiana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
do
you
just
think
that
is
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
borkon,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
on
an
assumption
on
the
policy
terms.
it
is
critical
i
guess
to
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
that
there
be
an
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
to
defend
the
insured.
suppose
they
changed
their
policy
language
to
provide
that
they
agreed
to
defend
the
insured
in
any
forum
in
which
personal
jurisdiction
can
be
obtained
over
the
insured
but
they
would
have
no
obligation
to
defend
when
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
was
a
quasi
in
rem
theory,
then
you
couldn't
hold
them,
could
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
indiana
would
let
them
write,
because
some
states
have
considered
this
kind
of
litigation
and
decided
not
to
adopt
this
kind
of
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
those
states
i
assume
they
would
permit
--
say
indiana
might
well
permit
that
kind
of
policy
to
be
written
and
issued
in
indiana,
but
that
is
what
it
said.
i
take
it
that
would
destroy
the
basis
for
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
rests
entirely
on
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
insured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
no
duty
to
defend
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
plaintiff
lives
in
minnesota
certainly
is
the
sufficient
basis
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
to
answer
if
you
have
no
contacts
in
minnesota
though.
the
defendant
would
have
no
risk
if
he
is
not
subject
to
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
