justice

f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
adamson,
may
i
ask
this
question
of
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
assume
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
in
order
to
protect
himself
against
the
possibility
that
minnesota
would
not
have
taken
jurisdiction,
had
simultaneously
instituted
a
personal
damage
suit
in
indiana,
the
situs
of
the
accident.
would
that
have
changed
the
situation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
he
may
have
thought
it
more
convenient
to
litigate
in
minnesota
but
just
as
an
anchor
to
win
with,
he
may
also
have
sued
in
indiana
so
that
if
his
insurer
paid
$50,000
in
minnesota,
the
plaintiff
still
might
recover
the
rest
of
that
million
dollars
you
mentioned
in
indiana
if
you
had
a
solvent
defendant,
if
this
was
a
20-year-old
young
man
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
presumably
incapable
of
responding
to
further
judgment.
but
what
i
was
asking
is
under
minnesota
law
would
the
simultaneous
institution
of
an
in
personam
action
in
indiana
have
ousted
in
rem
jurisdiction
in
minnesota.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
nobody
knows.
no
one
knows.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course,
what
he
owns
is
precisely
the
protection
of
an
insurance
policy
and
what
he
owns
is
the
promise
of
the
insurance
company
to
defend
him
against
such
suits
as
this.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know,
but
the
way
you
depend
on
shaffer
you
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
quite
proper
before
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
blame
you,
but
even
before
shaffer
your
arguments
sound
like
it
would
have
been
bad.
would
it?
only
new
york
before
shaffer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
under
what,
international
shoe
or
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
borkon,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your
argument.
are
you
saying
that
this
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
other
parties
is
what
controls
in
this
case?
suppose
the
driver
of
the
automobile
that
is
alleged
to
be
negligent
had
been
a
rockefeller.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
had
been
a
rockefeller,
with
many
millions
of
dollars
that
could
have
paid
any
deficiency
judgment,
would
you
have
dealt
if
you
had
the
case
originally
with
the
insurance
company
or
with
the
counsel
for
the
wealthy
defendant
who
could
pay
a
million
dollar
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
understand
whether
you
are
saying
that
minnesota
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case
only
because
the
only
party
likely
to
respond
to
any
judgment
anywhere
is
the
insurance
company.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
didn't
you
sue
originally
for
more
than
$50,000?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
brought
it
originally
for
$125,000
or
$150,000
as
i
recall.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
your
client
have
accident
insurance
with
--
he
was
injured
--
or
do
you
know?
is
there
anything
in
the
case
to
indicate
that?
he
was
injured
as
a
quest,
is
that
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
suffered
some
injuries
and
he
had
some
medical
expenses,
i
suppose.
is
that
a
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
borkon,
in
the
original
papers,
the
insurance
company
took
the
position
that
the
debt
was
zero,
as
i
understood
it,
because
it
was
a
contingent
liability.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
never
did
deny
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
defend
though,
did
they?
