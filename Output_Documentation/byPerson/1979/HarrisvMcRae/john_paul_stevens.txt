justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
not
correct
though
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
medical
problems
that
may
make
medical
necessity
the
reason
for
--
if
we
didn't
have
the
hyde
amendment,
might
justify
funding
the
abortion?
one
would
be
harm
to
the
mother,
and
the
other
i
suppose
would
be
potential
harm
to
the
newborn
child.
isn't
there
sometimes
a
finding
of
medical
necessity
that
can
be
based
on
a
prediction
that
some
health
problem
will
affect
the
child,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
is
there
the
same
state
interest
in
encouraging
that
kind
of
birth
as
in
encouraging
the
kind
of
birth
that
was
involved
in
maher?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
word
the
court
used
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
the
district
court
indicate
that
there
may
be
some
medically
necessary
abortions
because
you
couldn't
have
a
normal
childbirth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet
you
don't
think
it
is
significant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
get
back,
i
don't
understand
quite
why
you
omitted
"normal"
from
your
statement
of
what
the
policy
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
then,
i
see.
that
is
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
say
the
hyde
amendment
does
say
something
different
from
what
it
did
say,
or
let's
not
call
it
the
hyde
amendment
but
the
smith
amendment,
had
said
title
19
shall
be
applicable
only
to
non-white
people,
shall
not
cover
anybody
who
is
caucasion
or
who
is
white.
that,
i
presume
we
could
agree,
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
be
the
extent
of
a
court's
power
to
so
state
and
then
leave
it
up
to
congress
whether
they
wanted
to
include
everybody
or
not
anybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
constitutionally,
why
is
it
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
that's
great
many
people
would
be
benefitted,
it
just
wouldn't
cover
white
people,
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
clearly
it
is
unconstitutional
but
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
but
the
point
is
what
is
the
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
extent
of
the
court's
power,
appropriately
exercised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
extent
of
the
appropriate
exercise
of
its
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
do
i.
