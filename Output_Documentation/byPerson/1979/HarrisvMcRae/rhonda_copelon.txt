ms.
rhonda
copelon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
one
of
simple
principle
and
singular
magnitude.
it
involves
the
survival
and
the
health
of
potentially
millions
of
poor
women
in
this
country,
and
it
involves
reaffirmation
of
the
simple
rule
of
law
of
the
written
constitution
that
this
court
recognized
in
roe
v.
wade.
it
is
very
basic
that,
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
a
medicaid
program
designed
to
provide
a
broad
range
of
medically
necessary
and
essential
services
to
poor
people
throughout
the
country.
and
it
is
very
significant,
as
the
solicitor
general
agrees,
that
it
is
comprehensive
and
that
but
for
the
hyde
amendment
it
would
cover
abortions
as
a
mandatory
medically
necessary
service.
does
the
hyde
amendment
single
out
one
medically
necessary
service?
they
preclude
the
exercise
of
sound
medical
judgment
about
the
health
of
a
pregnant
woman
or
indeed
even
of
the
fetal
life.
they
prefer
fetal
life
at
the
expense
of
maternal
health
and
even
maternal
life.
if
the
district
court
found
the
hyde
amendment
repugnant
to
the
entire
scheme
of
the
medicaid
statute,
they
are
also
repugnant
to
the
most
minimal
safeguards
of
the
constitution.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
we
do
but
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
singling
out
of
the
one
service
of
abortion
in
the
context
of
an
intent
to
provide
medically
necessary
services
is
rational
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
and
the
constitutional
question
that
is
presented
to
this
court
and
the
one
we
will
discuss
today
is
simply
whether
under
the
minimal
standard
of
rationality
in
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
congress
can
single
out
that
one
service.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
our
argument
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
scheme
and
also,
and
more
importantly,
in
the
context
of
the
equal
protection
the
preference
for
fetal
life
at
the
expense
of
maternal
health
and
maternal
life
is
irrational
and
therefore
that
preference
cannot
be
drawn
by
the
congress.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
an
exclusion
in
the
context
of
that
program.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
and
it
emphasizes
in
a
sense
the
difference
and
the
very
critical
differences
between
this
case
and
maher
v.
roe
decided
three
years
ago.
in
maher,
the
court
was
dealing
only
with
the
question
of
covering
elective
abortions
in
the
context
of
a
program
which
covered
only
medically
necessary
services,
and
the
court
found
that
not
part
of
the
general
mandate
of
the
program.
here
the
solicitor
concedes
that
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
hyde
amendment.
no
doctor's
judgment
which
this
court
has
consistently
protected
and
recognized
the
importance
of,
from
all
of
the
abortion
decisions,
no
doctors
judgments
about
the
health
of
the
pregnant
women
were
at
issue
in
that
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
were
asking
that
the
program
effectively
be
extended.
we
are
saying
the
exclusion
of
one
service,
the
singling
out
of
one
service
raises
the
fundamental
equal
protection
problem
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
the
answer
is
it
is
not
a
rational
choice
in
the
context
of
a
medical
program
involving
medically
necessary
service
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
value
judgment.
it
is
basic
to
the
constitution
and
basic
to
what
this
court
held
in
roe
v.
wade.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
however
one
characterizes
the
congressional
judgment.
your
honor,
yes,
we
suggest
that
the
court
must
disagree
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
and
the
reason
that
the
constitution
disagrees
i
think
is
best
illustrated
if
one
looks
at
what
the
court
did
in
roe
v.
wade
when
it
looked
at
the
third
trimester.
the
relationship
between
that
situation
and
ours
compels
the
conclusions
that
the
trade-off
here
between
fetal
life
and
maternal
health
and
life
is
irrational.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
that
at
all.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
as
a
legal
matter
i
would
not
make
that
contention,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
point
here
is
not
how
one
characterizes
that
but
rather
whether
in
the
scheme
of
our
constitution
it
is
rational
to
make
that
preference,
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
third
trimester
in
roe
v.
wade,
if
i
may.
that
is
the
point
where
there
was
no
privacy
interests
of
the
woman.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
it
would
raise
very
different
questions
because
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
to
include
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
whether
it
was
irrational
unless
i
saw
the
context
in
which
the
exclusion
came
up.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
it
might
be
irrational.
however,
this
case
has
a
different
kind
of
question
and
the
question
here
is
really
the
validity
of
that
trade-off
between
fetal
life
and
maternal
health
and
life,
and
i
would
just
in
--
so
that
the
court
understands,
when
i
speak
of
a
trade-off
here,
i
am
relying
on
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
that
the
hyde
amendment
resulted
in
basically
a
virtually
total
exclusion
of
certifications
of
medically
necessary
abortions,
and
that
given
the
way
the
hyde
amendment
functions
with
all
its
uncertainty
and
with
the
impossibility
of
prediction
of
serious
problems
of
pregnancy,
to
have
a
statute
which
says
a
doctor
can
be
paid
for,
he
waits
for
the
patient
to
get
worse
means
that
that
woman
is
placed
in
life
jeopardizing
situations,
and
when
the
maternal
mortality
studies
show
that
abortions
are
frequently
performed
at
the
brink
of
death
and
frequently
fail,
so
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
in
practice
a
statute
which
prefers
fetal
life
not
only
to
the
health
of
women
but
to
their
very
lives.
now,
i
want
to
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
that
facts
must
always
be
relevant
to
the
question
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
well,
in
this
case
the
court
decides
the
facts
and
the
constitution
decides
whether
or
not
the
ultimate
judgment
is
rational.
here
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
with
regard
to
some
of
the
questions
earlier
to
the
solicitor
demonstrate
and
the
court
found
that
normal
childbirth
cannot
be
affected
through
the
hyde
amendment,
that
normal
childbirth
is
medically
impossible
for
reasons
that
the
encouragement
here,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
encouragement
complicated
pregnancy
and
also
of
abnormal
fetal
birth.
in
addition
to
that,
the
contention
here
cannot
be
that
there
is
just
a
state
interest
in
encouraging
childbirth
today.
the
panoply
of
family
planning
programs
attest
to
the
fact
that
that
alone
is
not
the
interest.
so
the
interest
that
the
state
is
asserting
over
the
health
and
the
life
of
the
woman
is
the
interest
in
fetal
life
itself
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
there
is
a
fairly
extensive
indication
of
mortality
rates
in
the
early
findings
of
the
district
court
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
the
normal
is
16
women
per
100,000
;
among
black
women,
for
example,
it
is
32
per
100,000.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
100,000
among
black
women.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
right.
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
life
endangering
standard
of
the
hyde
amendment
is
supposed
to
protect
women
against
life
endangering
risks.
the
measure
of
those
who
ultimately
die
is
not
the
measure
of
life
endangering
risks,
and
once
a
woman,
as
the
testimony
showed
in
the
district
court
found,
is
in
a
life
threatening
situation,
there
is
no
guarantee
for
her
survival.
there
are
examples
that
are
manifold
in
the
record
of
the
problem
with
this
standard.
let
me
just
cite
to
you
one
which
is
the
problem
of
the
woman
who
gets
pregnant
with
an
iud
in
place.
she
suffers
a
50
times
higher
risk
of
death
because
of
an
infection
that
occurs
in
the
late
second
trimester.
you
can
never
tell
in
the
early
stages
of
pregnancy
which
woman
will
suffer
it,
and
the
risks
go
50
times
higher
is
not
a
clearly
substantial
risk
before
the
infection
strikes.
the
fda
and
even
hew
recommend
that
the
iud
cannot
be
removed.
it
is
medically
essential
to
do
an
abortion
because
of
the
danger
of
that
rapid
infection
which
if
it
strikes
it
is
very
difficult
to
control.
so
this
is
a
situation
where
--
and
the
hew
statistics
show
that
between
1972
and
'74,
17
women
died
in
this
manner
in
is
this
country.
so
it
is
an
example,
your
honor,
of
the
problem
of
using
maternal
mortality
statistics
to
measure
the
scope
of
life
endangerment.
even
the
defendant-intervenors'
witnesses
in
this
case,
one
in
particular
testified
that
the
risks
of
poor
women
are
twice
as
high,
two
to
three
times
higher
than
for
women
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes,
and
that
in
addition
he
would
estimate
that
his
population,
which
is
at
a
catholic
hospital
and
involves
people
coming
for
prenatal
care,
would
estimate
15
percent
of
those
pregnancies
would
encounter
life
endangering
circumstances.
so
when
one
compares
that
with
the
fact
that
you
have
less
than
one
percent
of
prior
abortions
now
certified
under
medicaid,
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
really
the
effect
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
standard
and
the
fear
of
investigation
really
leads
to
a
crisis
intervention
standard
which
is
simply
too
late.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
question
in
this
case,
which
is
this
question
of
the
balance
that
congress
struck
between
fetal
life
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
that
makes
a
difference
because
it
changes
the
balance
of
concern
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
what
it
says
is
that
at
the
expensive
of
maternal
health
and
maternal
life
and
even,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated,
fetal
life,
one
is
going
to
have
this
virtually
absolute
preference
for
fetal
life.
and
we
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
constitution,
which
is
written
for
the
people,
and
as
roe
v.
wade
said,
which
protects
born
people,
one
cannot
make
that
trade-off
between
people
who
exist
and
the
potentiality
of
future
life.
it
is
the
constitution
upon
which
we
rely
that
says
that
this
is
a
fundamentally
irrational
trade-off.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
that
has
been
decided,
it
is
not
a
person
for
the
purposes
of
the
constitution,
and
i
dare
say
that
in
our
health
care
system,
even
if
some
whole
person's
life
is
at
stake,
we
don't
ask
another
person
to
involuntarily
sacrifice
their
health
and
their
life
for
their
well-being.
in
the
third
trimester
in
roe
v.
wade,
where
the
court
found
the
fetal
interest,
the
interest
in
potential
fetal
life
so
compelling
that
you
could
criminalize
and
prevent
abortion,
still
the
court
said
where
maternal
life
or
health
is
at
stake,
the
abortion
must
be
permitted.
and
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
you
have
decided
what
the
constitution
requires
and
what
the
minimum
of
rationality
is
or
legitimacy
of
purpose
is
under
the
constitution
and
you
decided
that
in
roe
v.
wade.
and
the
difference
between
the
regulatory
context
of
roe
v.
wade
and
the
funding
context
of
this
case
is
not
a
difference
which
is
relevant
to
that
balance,
because
something
that
is
fundamentally
irrational,
not
under
some
heightened
standard
of
scrutiny
but
fundamentally
irrational
simply
cannot
survive
whether
you
are
dealing
with
funding
or
not,
and
the
basic
teaching
of
maher
was
to
reaffirm
that
balance
of
interests
that
the
constitution
commanded
in
roe
v.
wade,
and
to
reaffirm
that
even
where
the
state
is
simply
giving
out
benefits,
it
must
do
it
in
a
basically
rational
way.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
very
different
case,
the
case
of
pornography
and
also
the
case
of
distribution
and
sale
as
opposed
to
use.
in
terms
of
griswold
and
eisenstadt,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
the
difference
between
distribution
and
sale
as
founded
in
a
regulatory
context
not
to
be
relevant.
the
pornography
example
just
doesn't
involve
the
kind
of
violation
of
what
we
would
call
either
basic
or
rational
permissible
judgment
under
the
constitution,
whether
one
calls
it
rational
or
one
calls
it
the
absence
of
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
light
of
the
constitutional
decision
of
roe
v.
wade.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
more
apt
analogy
would
be
if
there
were
some
kind
of
funding
program
involved,
and
it
would
be
hard
to
see
how
there
could
be
a
claim
for
the
payment
of
pornography
under
some
kind
of
funding
program
that
involved
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
irrelevant.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
the
rational
relationship
or
legitimacy
of
a
preference
for
fetal
life
over
maternal
health
and
life,
and
that
that
base
line
irrationality
in
roe
v.
wade
has
to
carry
over,
because
something
can't
become
rational
in
one
context
and
not
rational
in
another.
we
are
not
dealing
today
with
any
question
here
of
heightened
scrutiny.
we
have
done
that
in
our
brief.
what
we
are
saying
is
minimal
scrutiny
says
that
this
is
not
rational
in
this
context,
and
that
roe
v.
wade
as
a
constitutional
matter
has
decided
that
question.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
it
wasn't
exactly
raised
in
that
way.
it
was
more
raised
in
terms
of
the
total
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
correct,
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
right,
and
i
think
what
you
are
referring
to
is
what
one
might
enhance
by
calling
the
separation
of
powers
argument
here.
that
was
made
below.
the
court
denied
it.
the
court
relied
very
strongly
on
this
court's
decision
in
lovett
which
states
the
basic
principle
and
has
been
reaffirmed
since
in
powell
v.
mccormack,
that
the
legislature,
even
with
powers
particularly
confided
to
it,
cannot
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
and
the
court
held
basically
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
well,
i
think
it
should
cure
it
in
the
same
exact
way,
your
honor,
as
the
court
cures
the
problem
in
califano
v.
westcott.
there
is
basically
no
difference
between
this
case
and
califano
in
that
the
funding
rider,
as
the
solicitor
general
interprets
it,
modifies
the
program
and
the
question
then
is
what
would
congress
have
wanted
if
congress
were
to
choose
and
i
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
the
majority
was
correct
in
califano
and
that
that
holding
is
even
more
correct
here.
in
both
cases,
there
was
an
explicit
indication
from
congress
that
they
didn't
want
to
fund
something,
and
the
question
was,
given
the
favorability
clause
of
the
social
security
act,
would
congress
have
intended
to
eliminate
the
program.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
think
that
it
would
be
unimaginable
that
congress
would
eliminate
a
medicaid
program
that
we
have
had
for
fifteen
years,
that
millions
of
poor
people
around
this
country
rely
on
every
day
of
their
lives
for
this
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
the
obligation
of
the
court
in
deciding
what
remedy
is
appropriate
is
to
decide
that
question,
and
there
is
evidence
--
for
example,
in
1975,
congress
failed
to
pass
a
rider.
they
didn't
stop
the
hew
appropriations,
they
have
never
stopped
the
hew
appropriations,
even
though
the
proponents
of
the
hyde
amendment
yearly
tried
to
cut
back
on
the
additional
language
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
correct,
after
this
court's
judgment,
congress
could
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
they
would
be
free,
but
the
question
of
what
remedies
should
come
from
this
court
is
based
on
the
kind
of
assessment
the
court
made
in
califano
v.
westcott,
and
we
submit
that
the
devastating
impact
and
the
importance
and
centrality
of
the
medicaid
program
argue
even
more
powerfully
than
in
califano
v.
westcott
that
the
injunction
should
remain
intact.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
every
time
the
court
reviews
a
classification
in
a
welfare
program,
like
in
califano
v.
westcott
or
goldfarb
v.
califano,
it
is
doing
effectively
that.
it
is
basically
deciding
whether
congress
can
make
exceptions
that
it
has
made
or
whether
it
has
to
fund
something
that
it
may
not
have
wanted
to.
if
you
couldn't
do
that,
you
could
never
look
at
a
statute
under
inclusiveness
of
involving
the
payment
of
benefits
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
it
would.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
different
case
and
one
would
have
to
look
at
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
constitutionally,
basically
i
think
the
court
should
order
the
expansion
of
the
program
but
constitutionally
it
might
be
different
if,
for
example,
you
had
a
program
where
there
were
so
few
people
benefitted
and
so
many
not
benefitted
that
it
would
not
be
clear
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
the
difference
here,
i
think
that
is
unconstitutional
and
i
think
that
the
court
would
probably
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
right.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
and
the
court--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
a
court
clearly
has
the
power
to
remedy
that--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
by
including
it.
the
only
distinction
i
was
trying
to
make,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
this,
and
that
is
i
don't
know
the
exact
proportions
of
white
people
and
non-white
people
in
this
country
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
--
but
it
would
potentially
have
significance
if
the
non-included
class
were
so
large
that
one
really
had
to
doubt
whether
or
not
congress
can
continue
the
program
if
they
had
to
include
the--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
correct.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
absolutely
right
and
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
your
honor.
so
it
is
not
actually
an
expenditure
of
any
additional
treasury
funds.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
with
the
minutes
remaining
to
me
to
the
first
amendment
arguments
and
the
first
amendment
claims
that
were
treated
by
the
district
court.
the
fact
i
think,
going
back
to
the
trade-off
between
maternal
life
and
health
and
fetal
life,
brings
into
full
picture
in
this
court
the
nature
of
the
underlying
interests,
and
that
is
the
congress
wanted
to
and
the
proponents
of
the
hyde
amendment
sought
to
take
a
position
and
they
did
take
a
position
on
the
question
of
when
human
life
begins.
that
question
this
court
held
in
roe
v.
wade
is
impermissible
and
i
submit
that
is
impermissible
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it
is
in
addition,
as
the
record
will
extensively
document,
is
impermissible
under
the
first
amendment,
in
both
the
first
amendment
establishment
clause
and
free
exercise
clause.
this
is
the
first
time
in
at
least
a
decade
that
this
court
has
had
before
it
a
case
which
raises
at
once
the
establishment
and
free
exercise
claims,
and
it
requires
a
special
scrutiny.
we
are
concerned
here,
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
walz,
with
a
law
whose
basic
purpose
--
with
a
law
which
violates
the
basic
purpose
of
the
religion
clauses
which
is
to
insure
that
no
religion
be
sponsored
or
favored,
none
commanded
and
none
inhibited.
here
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
you
honor,
we
are
not
talking
about
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
--
we
are
not
talking
about
a
law
which
merely
coincides
with
religious
belief
and
we
are
not
talking
about
a
law
which,
like
the
constraint
on
murder,
is
something
which
is
part
of
the
secular
fabric
of
society
and
is
accepted
by
everyone.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
today
is
the
point
at
which
one
has
to
examine
what
the
purpose
and
what
the
character
is
of
the
belief
that
human
life,
full
actual
human
life
begins
at
conception.
the
district
court
made
extensive
findings
of
fact.
it
refused
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
establishment
clause
is
violated,
but
the
precedents
of
this
court
we
submit
support
the
invalidation
of
the
hyde
amendment
which
trade
off
maternal
life
for
fetal
life
on
the
basis
of
the
premise
that
life
begins
at
conception.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
your
honor,
exactly
like
epperson
v.
arkansas
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
this
law.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
their
freedom
to
enact
legislation.
they
have
an
equal
right
to
try.
it
is
the
question
of
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
because
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
the
establishment
clause
places
a
limit
on
the
political
entanglement
of
religion,
and
it
is
only
if
the
legislation
that
is
enacted
is
wholly
lacking
in
a
secular
purpose
which
we
think
the
documented
record
of
the
district
court,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
character
of
the
anti-abortion
movement.
i
am
not
even
talking
about
the
predominance
of
the
roman
catholic
church.
that
is
important.
but
the
critical
fact
is
that
in
looking
at
the
entire
anti-abortion
movement,
he
found
pervasive
religious
themes,
references,
advocacy
and
a
religious
purpose
expressed,
like
epperson,
based
on
a
creation
perspective
without
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
do
say
that,
because
they
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
you
do
not
have
to
say
that,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
think
the
issue
will
continue
to
be
before
the
court
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
he
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
problem
here
is
that
not
only
is
the
anti-abortion
movement
essentially
religious,
but
it
is
taking
a
position
on
a
religious
question
and
therefore
it
is
religiously
biased
legislation
which
impacts
particularly
on
poor
women
in
a
medicaid
program
which
has
as
a
principle
to
accommodate
religion.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
am
not
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
record
in
maher
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
premised
as
wholly
as
this
on
that
fundamental
belief
about
when
human
life
begins.
our
basic
argument
here
is
that
it
is
the
trade-off
between
the
maternal
life
itself,
it
is
the
preference
for
fetal
life
as
an
[illegible
word]
human
being
that
trades
off
the
well-being
of
the
maternal
life
and
maternal
health
that
really
brings
our
first
amendment
question
into
focus.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
probably
essential.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
as
this
court
has
held
many
times,
the
accommodation
of
religious
interests
is
permissible
so
long
as
there
is
not
a
direct
establishment
of
religion,
the
same
principle
as
sherbert,
and
i
think
that
would
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
if
i
may
just
take
a
moment
to
conclude,
your
honor
--
