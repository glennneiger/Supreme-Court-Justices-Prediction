rehnquist
that
is
where
maher
basically
differed
from
roe,
wasn't
it,
is
that
roe
v.
wade
was
not
discussing
the
funding
by
federal
or
state
of
abortions
but
simply
the
right
of
the
woman
to
consult
with
her
physician
and
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
have
the
abortion
without
restricted
state
prohibitions
on
the
physician's
right
to
give
advice
or
the
mother's
right
to
heed
the
advice;
where
maher
was
dealing
with
funding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
mccree,
one
senses
without
being
able
to
perhaps
point
to
the
exact
language
that
the
equal
protection
clause
deprives
the
federal
government
of
the
right
to
or
the
authority
to
effect
in
any
way
the
woman's
decision
whether
to
have
a
medically
necessary
or
medically
recommended
abortion
or
whether
to
carry
her
pregnancy
to
term.
if
my
recollection
serves
me,
canada
at
one
time
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
still
does
or
not
--
simply
paid
$1,000
to
every
family
to
which
a
child
was
born.
if
i
am
right
in
thinking
that
the
district
court
rested
its
analysis
on
what
i
think
it
did,
does
that
mean
the
government
couldn't
give
$1,000
to
every
mother
who
brought
a
new
life
into
the
world
unless
the
government
also
paid
$1,000
to
every
woman
who
had
a
medically
necessary
abortion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
rationale
of
maher
was
in
effect
that
the
government
can
prefer
the
producing
of
new
lives
to
the
financing
of
abortions
as
a
legitimate
interest
without
regard
to
cost?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
would
have
ruled
the
same
way
had
the
government
simply
placed
a
very
high
tariff
on
manichiewitz,
which
is
certainly
part
of
a
ritual
of
at
least
orthodox
and
perhaps
conservative
jewry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
as
to
substantially
raise
the
price
in
the
guise
or
protecting
and
perhaps
in
the
legitimate
guise
of
protecting
the
local
manufacturers
of
manischiewitz
wine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
the
logic
of
the
court's
ruling
on
the
free
exercise
clause
would
have
led
it
to
the
same
result
in
that
hypothetical?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
say
is
the
higher
scheme
of
the
hyde
amendment?
don't
we
have
to
take
the
enacted
will
of
congress
as
a
whole,
that
medicaid
plus
the
hyde
amendment
is
the
enacted
will
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
must
be
arguing
not
that
it
doesn't
serve
a
legitimate
or
rational
state
interest,
because
presumably
virtually
any
act
of
congress
will
do
that
if
applied
--
if
rational
scrutiny
is
applied.
you
have
to
say
that
one
purpose
of
congress
conflicts
with
another,
which
is
almost
incomprehensible
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
word
"irrational,"
i
take
it
you
mean
literally
those
who
voted
to
adopt
the
hyde
amendment
belong
in
the
looney
bin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
to
me
is
what
the
word
"irrational"
means,
that
they
just
went
off
the
wall.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
evidence
taken
by
a
single
federal
judge
over
a
period
of
months
under
our
constitutional
scheme
was
intended
to
be
allowed
to
invalidate
a
judgment
of
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
who
decides
the
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
miss
copelon,
let
me
ask
you
in
connection
with
the
case
that
is
non-funding,
which
you
are
not
now
talking
about,
stanley
v.
georgia,
where
the
court
found
that
the
government
couldn't
prohibit
the
possession
of
pornography
even
in
one's
own
home
as
well
as
any
number
of
other
books
in
one's
own
home,
based
on
an
implied
by
the
privacy,
nevertheless
two
or
three
years
after
stanley
in
united
states
v.
ridell,
the
court
held
that
the
government
could
prohibit
the
purchase
or
sale
of
pornography
even
though
the
purchaser
intends
to
use
it
in
his
home,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
although
the
government
must
allow
certain
things
if
they
are
done
entirely
apart
from
government
support,
the
government
may
proscribe
access
to
avenues
that
would
enable
the
person
to
enjoy
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
had
held
that
the
state
of
georgia
could
not
prohibit
the
reading
of
whatever
book
one
wanted
in
his
own
home,
and
yet
in
ridell
the
court
said
that
a
federal
statute
making
inaccessible
in
effect
books
which
the
person
might
want
in
his
own
home
was
perfectly
constitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
the
funding
distinction
was
irrelevant
and
that
we
ought
to
get
back
to
the
case
where
the
government
simply
prohibits
or
allows,
rather
than
as
in
maher
fund.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
sit
down
--
your
red
light
is
on
--
would
you
say
that
the
exception
of
the
volstead
act
for
wine
used
in
religious
rituals
was
therefore
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
certainly
motivated
in
a
desire
to
accommodate
religious
interests.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
the
hyde
amendment
was
an
establishment
of
religion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
certainly
a
hundred
years
ago
a
large
family
was
considered
social
security
for
the
parents,
because
they
realized
that
they
would
have
to
derive
the
work
from
the
farm
from
the
children
who
would
in
turn
support
them.
so
i
would
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
it
wasn't
at
least
a
rational
interest
to
say
to
bring
more
people
into
the
world
was
not
such.
