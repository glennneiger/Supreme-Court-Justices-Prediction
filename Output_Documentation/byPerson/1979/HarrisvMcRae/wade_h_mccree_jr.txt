mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
it
might
be
helpful
to
state
what
this
appeal
concerns
and
what
it
does
not
concern.
at
page
291
of
its
opinion,
the
district
court
said
the
inquiry
here
is
not
what
is
wise
policy
but
whether
the
congress
has
or
has
not
adopted
a
policy
which,
wise
or
unwise,
the
law
forbids.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
proper
approach
to
the
case
and
that
the
voluminous
evidence
in
the
preceding
290
pages
of
the
opinion
would
be
useful
in
forming
and
informing
a
legislative
judge
but
not
especially
helpful
when
we
address
the
constitutionality
of
the
hyde
amendment.
we
regard
the
issues
as
two
-
first,
whether
the
hyde
amendment
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
by
authorizing
federal
funds
for
medically
necessary
services
generally
and
for
abortions
only
when
the
life
of
the
mother
would
be
endangered
if
the
fetus
were
carried
to
term
but
not
for
other
medically
necessary
abortions
and,
second,
whether
by
restricting
the
availability
of
federal
funds
for
medically
necessary
abortions
the
hyde
amendment
deprives
pregnant
women
of
the
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
religious
freedom
protected
by
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
title
19
of
the
social
security
act,
commonly
called
the
medicaid
act,
is
a
cooperative
program
under
which
the
federal
government
provides
financial
assistance
to
the
states
that
choose
to
reimburse
the
categorically
need
and
optionally
the
medically
needy
for
the
costs
of
medical
services
in
at
least
five
categories.
these
categories
are
in-patient
hospital
services,
out-patient
hospital
services,
other
laboratory
and
x-ray
services,
skilled
nursing
services,
periodic
screening
and
diagnostic
services,
children
and
family
planning
and
physician
services.
the
act
does
not
expressly
require
participating
states
to
pay
for
abortions
or
for
any
other
specified
medical
procedures.
the
hyde
amendment
comes
into
the
picture
in
this
fashion
-
in
december
1977,
in
a
joint
resolution
providing
appropriations
for
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
for
the
last
ten
months
of
fiscal
year
1978,
congress
modified
an
earlier
version
of
the
hyde
amendment
to
include
these
exceptions
to
the
general
prohibition
against
abortions,
necessary
medical
procedure
for
victims
of
incest
and
rape
--
excuse
me,
i
have
misstated
myself.
i
would
like
leave
to
say
that
initially,
in
september
1976,
congress,
by
the
so-called
hyde
amendment,
limited
the
availability
of
funds
to
reimburse
the
costs
of
medically
indicated
or
therapeutic
abortions
by
providing
that
none
of
the
funds
contained
in
the
act
should
be
used
to
perform
abortions
except
when
the
life
of
the
mother
would
be
endangered
by
carrying
the
fetus
to
term.
this
original
hyde
amendment
has
been
subsequently
amended.
it
has
been
amended
to
add
a
second
exception
to
the
one
where
the
mother's
life
would
be
endangered
by
carrying
the
fetus
to
term
where
necessary
medical
procedures
for
victims
of
incest
and
rape
promptly
reported
are
included,
and
whose
severe
and
long-lasting
physical
health
damage
to
the
mother
would
result
if
the
pregnancy
were
carried
to
term
as
so
determined
by
two
physicians.
these
revised
versions
have
appeared
in
subsequent
appropriations
and
the
current
form
of
the
hyde
amendment
now
consists
of
just
the
first
two,
where
the
life
of
the
mother
would
be
endangered
if
the
fetus
were
carried
to
term
or
in
the
case
of
victims
of
incest
or
rape
when
promptly
reported.
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
filed
a
complaint
in
1976,
the
day
on
which
the
initial
version
of
the
hyde
amendment
was
adopted.
cora
mcrae,
the
named
plaintiff,
a
medicaid
recipient,
was
in
the
first
trimester
of
her
pregnancy,
wished
to
have
an
abortion.
she
did
not
allege
that
the
procedure
was
medically
necessary
or
that
continuation
of
her
pregnancy
would
endanger
her
life.
the
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction,
requiring
the
secretary
to
fund
all
abortions,
but
then
this
court
decided
the
case
of
maher
v.
roe
which
provided
in
essence
that
the
equal
protection
component
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
case
was
not
violated
by
excluding
non-therapeutic
or
elective
abortions
from
federal
funding.
this
case
then
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
consider
in
the
light
of
the
court's
opinion
in
maher
v.
roe
and
the
court
took
testimony
over
a
period
of
13
months
and
finally
in
january
of
this
year
decided
that
the
discrimination
between
medically
necessary
abortions
and
other
medically
necessary
procedures
violated
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
it
further
violated
the
protection
accorded
pregnant
women
by
the
liberty
implicit
in
the
fifth
amendment,
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
it
also
said
in
a
passage
which
is
not
exactly
clear
to
us
that
it
violated
the
rights
of
juveniles
because
they
were
the
persons
who
had
the
greatest
occasion
to
request
abortions
to
terminate
their
pregnancy.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
is
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
class
was
viewed
as
the
suspect
class
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
because
they
are
under
the
adolescent
health
services
and
pregnancy
prevention
and
care
act
and
he
found
that
their
equal
protection
rights
were
offended
by
the
statute.
our
argument
is
essentially
as
follows
-
we
contend
that
the
hyde
amendment
is
rationally
related
to
the
legitimate
governmental
interests
in
preserving
potential
human
life
and
encouraging
child
birth.
we
submit
that
the
first
approach
is
to
determine
the
proper
test
to
apply.
we
suggest
that
in
maher
this
court
made
it
clear
that
the
proper
test
was
the
rational
relationship
test.
in
that
case,
which
of
course
involved
non-therapeutic
or
elective
abortions,
the
court
held
that
it
was
sufficient
if
the
congress
had
a
legitimate
objective
and
if
the
measure
was
rationally
related
to
it,
and
in
that
case
it
found
that
its
interests
in
preserving
potential
human
life
and
encouraging
child
birth
was
an
appropriate
relationship
and
it
upheld
the
challenge
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
suggest
here,
where
the
classification
is
between
medically
necessary
procedures
generally
and
medically
necessary
abortions
except
those
specified,
that
the
same
test
should
be
applied
and
that
the
same
governmental
interests
in
preserving
potential
human
life
and
encouraging
child
birth
is
a
legitimate
governmental
goal
rationally
related
to
the
refusal
to
fund
generally
medically
necessary
abortions.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
another,
yes,
if
the
court
please,
there
is
another
interest.
there
is
the
medical
necessity
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
a
life
and
health
interest
but
not
of
the
degree
specified
in
the
hyde
amendment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
different
from
maher
in
that
respect,
but
we
suggest
that
not
different
in
the
sense
that
it
should
require
a
different
analysis.
we
still
think
that
in
this
area
of
conferring
a
benefit,
not
a
prohibition,
not
the
imposition
of
a
penalty,
that
the
rational
relationship
standard
should
apply.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
district
court
agrees
with
us.
we
are
certain
of
that
in
every
respect
except
possibly
the
respect
relating
to
the
teenagers,
and
in
that
respect
it
may
not.
but
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
exactly
my
understanding
of
the
difference.
roe
was
concerned
with
the
state's
prohibition
of
the
woman's
right
in
consultation
with
her
physician
to
have
an
abortion.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
a
serious
criminal
offense,
and
we
say
that
the
difference
in
maher
is,
looking
at
a
benefit
conferred
in
the
nature
of
public
funding,
the
court
found
that
a
different
analysis
was
appropriate
and
reached
a
different
result.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
i
would.
i
think
i
would
say
that
you
would
make
the
rational
relation
--
you
would
still
apply
the
same
formula
because
you
are
talking
about
bestowing
a
benefit.
it
doesn't
prevent
this
woman
from
obtaining
an
abortion,
it
just
denies
her
federal
funding
for
that
purpose
and
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh,
i
think
we
have
to.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
judgment
that
is
--
we
must
assume
that
and
i
think
that
is
a
judgment
that
the
congress
must
make.
the
congress
in
the
first
instance
did
not
have
to
appropriate
money
to
reimburse
any
medical
services
whatsoever.
and
just
because
roe
said
that
the
state
could
not
punish
a
person
under
its
criminal
laws
for
obtaining
an
abortion
in
the
first
trimester
and
the
other
refinements,
that
still
did
not
obligate
the
state
or
the
federal
government
to
reimburse
her
for
the
services.
and
we
think
this
is
the
kind
of
discretion
that
is
vested
in
the
congress,
to
decide
what
to
do
in
this
--
we
are
speaking
about
a
unique
phenomenon.
this
is
the
only
--
a
pregnant
woman
is
the
only
person
seeking
reimbursement
for
medical
services
in
a
situation
where
potential
human
life
is
involved.
it
is
unique
and
we
say
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
must
have
a
reason
and
we
think
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
if
the
court
finds
that
--
well,
let's
say
a
legitimate
reason
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
the
approach
in
maher
and
that
is
the
way
we
read
maher.
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
does
not
at
all,
nor
does
the
medicaid
got
generally.
the
medicaid
act
provides
funding
for
certain
kinds
of
services
but
it
does
not
restrict
the
state
from
using
its
judgment
to
extend
the
funding
to
other
areas
--
its
funding
to
other
areas
where
there
will
be
no
federal
reimbursement.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
can
tell
you
with
reference
to
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
i
could
tell
you
with
reference
to
the
briefs.
i
know
new
york,
for
example,
funds
abortions
and
that
is
a
state,
of
course,
from
which
this
plaintiff,
cora
mcrae,
comes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
michigan
does,
several
do.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
my
recollection,
but
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
any
may
choose
to
do
so,
and
new
york
has
never
ceased
to
fund
abortions,
according
to
my
information.
in
the
appellees'
brief,
there
are
two
or
three
references
to
the
states
that
do,
and
i
could
find
it
without
too
much
difficulty,
i
am
certain.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
find
no
offense
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
such
a
program.
indeed,
it
costs
more
to
bring
a
--
to
afford
a
pregnant
woman
pre-natal,
obstetrical
and
postpartum
care
than
it
does
to
perform
an
abortion,
so
in
a
sense
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
government
concedes
this,
and
this
is
set
forth
in
appellees'
brief
and
i
think
we
concede
it
in
our
brief,
too,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
make
a
frank
concession
about
that.
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
it
costs
more
to
give
a
pregnant
woman
pre-natal,
obstetrical,
postpartum
services
than
it
does
to
abort,
certainly
in
the
first
trimester
if
there
are
no
complications.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
the
companion
case,
this
is
my
understanding.
but
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
it
can
and
this
is,
of
course,
what
we
asserted
as
the
essence
of
our
argument
on
the
equal
protection
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
it
acknowledges
that
it
might
be
different.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
there
is
a
difference.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
analysis
should
be
the
same.
as
i
suggested,
we
begin
with
the
proposition
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
fund
a
right
that
a
person
has
to
get
an
appendectomy.
the
state
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
i
suspect
the
state
could
exclude
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
hyde
amendment
does
exclude
certain
kinds
of
procedures,
in-hospital
care
for
tuberculosis
patients
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
medicaid
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
medicaid
act,
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
does
exclude
those
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
mental
illness,
institutionalized
tuberculosis
and
so
forth,
and
no
one
suggests
that
it
can't
do
that
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
addressing
the
other
grounds
for
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
district
court
seems
to
say
that
since
some
women
as
a
matter
of
their
religious
convictions
or
conscience
would
seek
an
abortion,
that
to
refuse
funding
for
them
would
somehow
deny
their
first
amendment
right
to
freedom
of
religion
and
free
exercise
of
religion.
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
that
because
it
would
seem
that
the
free
exercise
clause
presents
interference
with
but
doesn't
obligate
the
state
to
finance
it,
and
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
a
person
who
has
no
right
to
expect
the
state
to
furnish
him
with
religious
objects,
for
example,
a
bible
or
any
religious
artifacts
to
enable
him
freely
to
exercise
his
religion.
but
this
seems
to
be
the
thrust
of
that
aspect
of
the
opinion
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
want
to
make
certain
i
understand
the
question.
you
are
saying
that
if
the
government
had
placed
an
excessive
tax
on
it,
whether
this
would
violate
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh,
no,
i
think
it
would
not
be
at
all
if
the
government
had
a
sectarian
purpose
for
doing
that.
now,
i
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
of
course,
and
i
appreciate
the
court's
suggestion
of
that.(laughter)
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
not
quite,
because
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
profound
utterance
with
which
i
will
concur
immediately.
i
would
like
to
suggest
one
other
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
we
do
not
attach
any
special
significance
to
the
use
of
"normal"
in
the
maher
case
and
that
is
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
that
explains
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
as
reading
normal
without
any
special
significance.
we
think
it
adds
nothing
or
detracts
nothing
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
that
is
why
we
omitted
it.
it
was
a
deliberate
omission.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was
a
deliberate
omission,
because
we
felt
it
was
not
significant.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
there
might
not
be,
and
what
you
are
doing
is
putting
content
into
the
word
"normal"
and
i
agree.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
and
i
agree
that
there
is
that
difference
and
i
agree
with
the
court's
suggestion.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
--
yes,
i
believe
in
that
sense
it
is
significant,
i
have
to
concede.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
still
think
that
the
congress
has
to
make
that
judgment.
the
congress
doesn't
have
to
fund
medical
procedures
even
where
there
might
be
an
abnormal
child.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
because
the
congress
just
doesn't
have
to
solve
all
of
the
social
problems
in
a
single
pattern
or
program
of
legislation.
it
can
solve
those
that
it
believes
in
its
judgment
have
the
greatest
priority
for
it
at
a
given
time.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
it
certainly
can,
i
certainly
would
have
to
concede
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
if
the
court
please,
the
state
interest
in
the
interest
in
preserving
potential
human
life,
this
is
the
only
procedure
that
would
affect
potential
human
life
and
we
suggest
that
this
alone
is
sufficient
reason.
there
are
other
reasons
that
we
touch
on
in
our
brief.
we
suggest
the
congress
might
have
a
sufficient
reason
in
being
reluctant
to
appropriate
funds
for
procedures
of
some
persons,
large
numbers
of
persons
find
morally
repugnant,
but
we
don't
rest
solely
on
that.
we
think
that
either
or
both
is
a
sufficient
statement
of
a
legitimate
government
interest.
if
the
court
please,
i
have
a
very
few
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
have
just
two
points
to
make,
if
i
may.
on
the
first
instance,
no
plaintiff
in
this
case
claims
that
she
wanted
an
abortion
because
of
an
abnormal
child.
that
isn't
in
the
case
at
all.
and
the
second
point,
we
didn't
address
the
establishment
clause
argument
because
the
court
had
ruled
against
it
and
we
would
rely
on
our
brief
in
its
discussion
of
mcgowan
and
cases
of
that
sort
on
that
point.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
the
point
in
our
brief
and
that
is
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
although
we
are
not
making
that
argument,
although
that
would
be
a
legitimate
reason
for
the
congress
to
enact
such
legislation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
there
is
no
such
fact.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
say
these
are
considerations
of
the
congress.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
would
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
its
wisdom
is
committee
to
the
congress
and
not
to
the
court.
thank
you.
