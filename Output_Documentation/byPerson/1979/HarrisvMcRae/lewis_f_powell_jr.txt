mr.
solicitor
general,
the
hyde
amendment
does
not
prevent
a
state
choosing
itself
to
fund
abortions,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general
mccree,
would
you
summarize
how
the
government
describes
the
state
interest
that
it
relies
on
as
supporting
the
hyde
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
apply
the
first
amendment
argument
to
non-therapeutic
abortions,
the
maher
v.
roe
type
situation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
had
argued
maher,
would
you
be
making
the
first
amendment
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
had
a
negative
birth
rate
for
a
sustained
period
of
time,
i
should
think
that
would
be
quite
a
significant
and
important
argument.
it
would
eventually
shrink
to
a
point
where
it
might
not
be
able
to
exist
economically,
if
you
project
yourself
a
hundred
years
down
the
road.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
over-population
is
a
greater
threat,
i
suppose.
