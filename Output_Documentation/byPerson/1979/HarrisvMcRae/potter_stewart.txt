justice
potter
stewart
that
passage
in
the
district
court's
opinion
was
an
aspect
of
its
holding
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
firth
amendment,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
because
of
another
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
more
specifically,
it
was
concerned
with
state
law
that
made
it
a
serious
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
general,
in
the
maher
case,
the
connecticut
attorney
general,
as
i
remember
the
argument,
acknowledged
that
the
case
would
be
different
if
they
did
not
fund
medically
necessary
abortions.
so
this
is
a
different
issue
than
that
case,
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that
much?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be,
i
guess
that
is
what
he
said.
and
they
did
in
fact
fund
medically
necessary
abortions,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
analysis
should
be
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
the
hyde
amendment
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
medicaid
act.
justice
potter
stewart
mental
illness.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
did
you
think
the
court
would
rule
the
same
way?
the
only
possible
answer
is
you
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
provide
medically
necessary
services
with
the
exception
of
abortion
except
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
thrust
of
my
brother's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
miss
copelon,
your
argument
would
be
no
stronger
and
no
weaker
if
the
so-called
hyde
amendment
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
statute
originally
enacted
by
congress,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
miss
copelon,
you
say
it
is
irrational
to
prefer
the
fetal
life
interest
to
the
health
of
the
mother.
that
involves
a
weighing
of
respective
interests
and
suggests
that
the
court
just
say
that,
although
congress
thought
it
was
a
rational
choice,
that
we
should
just
disagree
with
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
answerable
yes
or
no?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
congress
thought
it
was
quite
rational,
we
should
disagree
with
that
value
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
anyway,
you
suggest
we
disagree
with
congress
in
that
judgment,
whatever
kind
of
a
judgment
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
constitution
disagrees?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
should
that
be
left
up
to
congress
after
the
court
has
held
that
what
congress
did
do
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
just
an
informed
guess
on
the
part
of
the
court,
but
congress
knows
what
it
wants
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
told
that
what
it
has
done
is
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
are
quite
right,
as
a
matter
of
political
prediction,
but
isn't
that
for
congress
to
decide?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
would
be,
congress
would
be
totally
free
under
the
constitution
to
completely
repeal
title
19,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
before
or
after,
at
any
time.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
miss
copelon,
westcott
involved
an
extension
of
benefits,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
an
increase
in
the
expenditure
of
public
funds.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
that
it
may
be
that
even
in
the
situation
of
that
light,
you
could
argue
on
the
basis
of
westcott
that
the
court
could
extend,
as
it
did
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
with
the
hyde
amendment,
if
you
invalidate
those
restrictions
that
saves
federal
money
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
your
argument
is
correct
that
would
be
--
what
you
say
would
invalidate
almost
every
criminal
law
we
have,
because
most
of
them
coincide
with
at
least
if
they
don't
stem
from
religion
tenets,
the
laws
against
murder
and
theft
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
all
come
from
the
ten
commandments.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
becomes
so
and
its
origins
were
religious
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
an
establishment
clause
argument
that
you
are
making?
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
mean,
i
suppose,
the
result
would
be
that
religiously
motivated
people
wouldn't
be
free
effectively
to
lobby
congress
to
enact
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
they
succeed,
then
the
legislation
that
is
enacted
violates
the
exception
clause.
