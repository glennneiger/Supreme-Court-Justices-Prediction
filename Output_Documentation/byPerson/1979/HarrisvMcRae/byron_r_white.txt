justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
is
another
interest
involved
though
on
the
woman's
side,
isn't
there,
that
wasn't
in
maher?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
life
and
health
interest
of
the
mother.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
exactly,
but
different
from
maher?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
make
the
same
rational
basis
argument
if
the
hyde
amendment
did
not
contain
the
exception
for
endangering
the
life
of
the
mother,
if
it
was
her
death
rather
than
adverse
impact
on
her
health
that
was
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
to
assume
for
purposes
of
analysis
at
least
that
some
women
will
be
denied
abortions
if
they
don't
receive
federal
funding?
i
thought
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
district
court's
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
we
therefore
must
also
assume
that
some
of
those
women
will
suffer
serious
medical
harm.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
must
have
a
reason,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
has
a
reason,
any
rational
basis,
that
ends
the
role
of
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
what
the
interests
on
the
other
side
are,
under
the
rational
relationship
test,
i
take
it
you
argue
that
there
is
no
balance
involved
at
all,
it
is
just
if
there
is
a
rational
basis
that
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
government
concedes
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
hasn't
always
been
conceded,
you
know,
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
finding
in
the
companion
case,
too,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you,
in
maher
v.
roe,
the
state
interest
was
described
there
as
a
policy
choice
to
favor
normal
childbirth.
your
brief
throughout,
as
i
read
it,
speaks
of
it
as
a
desire
to
encourage
childbirth.
you
don't
say
normal
childbirth.
is
that
intentional?
are
you
speaking
of
a
different
state
interest
than
we
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
should
we
view
it
as
normal?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
to
read
yours
as
meaning
normal?
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"normal"
anywhere
in
the
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
why
you
omit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
may
i
interrupt
there
for
just
a
minute.
you
have
properly
emphasized
the
importance
of
maternal
life.
does
the
record
provide
any
statistics
as
to
the
mortality
rate
of
expectant
women
associated
with
pregnancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
number
per
1,000
or
per
10,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
32
per
--
justice
byron
r.
white
32
per
100,000
pregnancies.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
day,
you
put
considerable
emphasis
on
the
hyde
amendment
does
not
encourage
normal
childbirth
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
encourages
abnormal
childbirth.
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
an
argument
that
the
fetus
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
consideration
in
the
court
below
or
any
argument
about
whether
the
court
should
simply
declare
the
amendment
unconstitutional
and
leave
it
up
to
congress
as
to
whether
to
eliminate
the
funding
for
all
abortions
or
just
some
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
was
an
order
to
--
in
effect,
there
is
an
order
now
to
fund
all
medically
necessary
abortions.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
leaving
the
solution
up
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
true.
that
is
just
begging
the
question
of
which
way
should
it
cure
the
--
of
course
it
can't
violate
the
constitution
--
which
way
to
cure
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
your
opponent
has
focused
more
narrowly
on
the
precise
interests
of
the
government
at
stake
here
than
i
had
really
caught
before.
in
your
summary
of
argument,
you
describe
the
interest
as
that
in
preserving
potential
human
life
and
encouraging
childbirth.
but
she
makes
the
point
that
there
is
no
overriding
government
interest
in
having
a
larger
population,
as
some
countries
sometimes
want
to
encourage
childbirth
generally.
i
take
it
you
do
not
mean
by
that
just
encouraging
more
births
throughout
the
country
you
really
are
talking,
or
am
i
wrong,
about
the
motion
of
preserving
fetal
life
and
the
unborn
fetus
a
chance
to
survive?
that
is
what
it
is
limited
to,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
any
national
or
state
interest
in
having
more
people
in
the
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
indication
that
that
was
in
fact
the
reason
that
motivated
anybody
in
this
case.
