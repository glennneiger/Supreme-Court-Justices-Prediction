the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
78-1268,
harris
v.
mcrae.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
possible,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
adjective
"normal"
in
that
setting
could
have
a
range
of
different
meanings?
it
might
mean
normal
as
distinguished
from
complicated.
it
might
mean
several
other
things.
i
suppose
it
has
not
one
fixed
meaning,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
miss
copelon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
we
had
a
jones
amendment,
let
us
say,
that
excluded,
as
the
hyde
amendment
does
with
respect
to
these
abortions,
excluded
the
treatment
for
drug
addiction
on
the
grounds
perhaps
that
drug
addiction
is
self-induced
and
just
excluded
it,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
irrational?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
context
would
be
exactly
the
legislation
we
now
have
and
add
in
exactly
the
words
of
the
hyde
amendment
"drug
addiction."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
a
court
may
direct
and
command
the
congress
how
to
exercise
the
taxing
and
spending
power?
isn't
that
what
your
statement
comes
down
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired,
counsel.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
--
excuse
me,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
it
your
point
is,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
at
any
given
time,
whatever
the
population
situation
may
be,
this
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
not
for
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
