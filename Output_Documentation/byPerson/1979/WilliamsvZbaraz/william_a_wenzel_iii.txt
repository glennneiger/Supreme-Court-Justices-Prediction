mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
here
today
on
behalf
of
jeffrey
c.
miller,
the
acting
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid.
director
miller,
the
defendant
below,
appeals
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
which
invalidated
illinois
public
act
80-1091
as
violative
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
for
women
who
are
seeking
medically
necessary
abortions,
but
not
abortions
which
were
necessary
to
preserve
their
lives.
the
issue
today
before
the
court
is
two-fold.
first,
there
is
the
equal
protection
issue,
whether
or
not
the
state
may
validly
limit
abortion
funding
under
its
medical
assistance
programs
to
instances
where
the
mother's
life
would
be
preserved
taking
into
account
the
state's
interest
in
fetal
life
and
also
taking
into
account
the
state's
willingness
to
fund
alternative
treatments
to
abortion.
the
second
issue
really
should
be
discussed
first,
because
it
certainly
shapes
and
clarifies
equal
protection
issue,
that
issue
is,
what
is
the
state's
obligations
under
title
xix
of
the
social
security
act?
a
short
background
would
be
appropriate
to
bring
these
issues
into
focus.
the
illinois
generally
assembly
in
december
of
1977
enacted
on
a
public
act
p80-1091
in
response
to
two
federal
initiatives.
earlier
that
year,
this
court
had
issued
it's
rulings
in
the
cases
of
maher
versus
roe,
beal
versus
doe
and
poelker
versus
doe.
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
indigent
pregnant
women
have
no
constitutional
right,
nor
statutory
entitlement
to
a
nontherapeutic
abortion.
earlier,
united
states
congress,
as
was
explored
in
a
case
that
just
preceded
us,
had
enacted
the
first
version
of
the
federal
hyde
amendment.
the
federal
hyde
amendment
limited
abortion
funding
under
the
medicaid
act,
except
where
an
abortion
was
necessary
to
avoid
the
endangerment
of
the
woman's
life.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
we
do
not
take
that
position
of
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
--
interpretation
of
title
xix.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
correct.
our
view
of
title
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
after
roe
versus
wade.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
the
states
were
operating
under
a
discretionary
authority
to
fund
abortions
whether
they'd
be
medically
necessary
or
elective
abortions
or
not
fund
such
abortions.
according
to
the
primary
test
under
title
xix,
that
is
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
standard
for
establishing
eligibility
or
the
scope
of
medical
assistance
under
the
act.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
what
the
hyde
amendment
did
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
guess
is
a
followup
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
if
it
means
what
--
it
depends
on
what
we
mean
by
a
therapeutic
abortion.
i
would
take
the
--
we're
taking
the
position
here
today
that
if
by
therapeutic
abortion
we
mean
simply
health
impairing,
but
not
necessary
to
preserve
life
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
--
that
the
state
would
have
been
free
to
exclude
funding
for
such
abortions
because
that
is
in
our
--
in
our
view
of
things,
consistent
with
section
1396a
(a)
(17),
the
reasonable
standards
language.
but
if
by
a
therapeutic
abortion,
we
mean
an
abortion
which
is
necessary
to
preserve
life
or
to
avoid
a
threat
of
death,
then
i
would
say
that
any
state
that
had
such
a
total
prohibition
on
the
funding
of
abortions
in
1974
for
example,
would
not
be
able
to
meet
the
statutory
tests
set
out
in
section
1396a
(a)
(17).
the
hyde
amendment
effectively
strips
dates
of
the
discretion
to
fund
non-hyde
amendment
abortions.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
it
strips
days
of
the
discretion
to
fund
them
within
the
context
of
the
medicaid
program.
it
lets
them
totally
free.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
i'd
--
making
a
distinction
between
stripping
states
of
the
discretion
of
doing
something
or
funding
something
within
the
context
of
the
medical
assistance
program,
that
is
the
joint
cooperative
program
and
what
states
do
outside
of
that
cooperative
program
within
their
own
state-authorized
and
state-funded
programs.
illinois
in
addition
to
the
medicaid
program
has
two
wholly
state-authorized
and
state-funded
programs,
a
program
for
general
assistance,
for
--
program
for
aid
to
the
medical
indigent.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
under
its
own
programs,
with
its
state,
with
its
own
funds,
correct.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
if
it's
willing
to
pay
for
them.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
which
does
not
affect,
though
it's
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
well,
our
--
our
position
rests
with
the
analysis
of
the
impact
to
the
hyde
amendment
on
--
on
title
xix
itself
as
--
as
the
first
circuit
in
preterm
versus
dukakis
and
the
second
--
seventh
circuit.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
argument
has
to
be
made
that
the
hyde
amendment
has
a
substantive
impact
on
title
xix.
there's
a
substantive
impact
on
title
xix
by
modifying
the
state's
discretion
to
fund
or
not
fund
abortions.
if
it
didn't
have
any
substantive
impact,
then
what
it
would
be
doing
is
altering
impliedly
the
state's
right
to
receive
federal
reimbursement,
but
there's
no
--
no
evidence
of
that
either
in
the
language
of
the
hyde
amendment
or
in
any
of
the
debates
in
congress
--
that
it
would
--
congress
intended
to
require
states
as
a
condition
of
participation
in
title
xix,
to
fund
non-hyde
amendment
abortions.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
we
--
we
view
the
debates
of
congress
as
having
use
an
appropriation
vehicle,
but
that
they
were
clear
--
the
intent
was
clear
that
what
they
were
doing
is
engaging
in
substantive
legislation.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
no,
your
honor.
they
would
--
they
would
either
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
--
they
have
to
come
up
but
they
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
but
in
this
particular
case,
this
court
in
prior
decisions,
has
looked
to
see
whether
congress
has
successively
admit
that
the
same
sort
of
writer
and
when
that
sort
of
pattern
of
congress's
intent
is
--
is
present
then,
it
strengthens
the
conclusion
that
they
intended
to
engage
in
substantive
legislation.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
yes,
we
could.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
yes,
we
could
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
the
state
could
have
independent
from
its
state
medicaid
program,
either
paid
for
all
or
paid
for
none.
but
if
the
law
for
example
had
been
amended
in
1970,
at
that
point
in
time,
illinois
is
participating
in
title
xix.
and
as
i
answered
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
believe
it
would've
been
reasonable
or
consistent
with
the
mandates
under
title
xix
for
illinois
to
exclude
life
preserving
or
life
threatening
abortions.
essentially,
this
dispute
is
a
result
of
a
footnote
in
the
court's
ruling
in
beal
versus
doe,
it
said
that
serious
questions
would
be
raised
if
the
court
–
if
the
states
intended
to
exclude
medically
necessary
care
and
the
court
in
that
opinion
also
made
reference
to
the
definition
of
medical
necessity
in
doe
versus
bolton
which
said
that
an
abortion
is
necessary
when
a
physician
exercising
his
professional
judgment
in
light
of
all
factors
whether
they'd
be
physical,
emotional,
psychological,
economic,
familial
age,
all
of
those
factors.
if
they're
relevant
to
health,
the
doctor
should
be
giving
that
leeway.
that
is
an
appropriate
standard
within
the
context
of
litigation
dealing
with
criminal
sanctions.
we
feel
that
it
is
wholly
inappropriate
to
impose
that
the
district
court
did
below
the
doe
versus
bolton
definition
with
medical
necessity.
what
that
does
in
effect
is
to
transform
the
medicaid
program
into
a
program
run
and
controlled
by
providers
as
opposed
to
being
run
and
controlled
by
the
state.
the
state
under
medicaid
has
discretion
as
we
pointed
out.
illinois
has
exercised
that
discretion,
has
made
exclusions
beyond
merely
abortions.
we
do
not
pay
for
several
services
of
categories
in
particular
procedures.
we
do
not
pay
for
infertility
and
sterility
procedures.
we
do
not
pay
for
transsexual
surgery.
we
--
imposed
durational
limitation
requirements
on
inpatient
care.
illinois
view
this
--
participation
in
medicaid
as
providing
adequate,
non-comprehensive
care
to
the
indigent
and
i
think
that
that
is
crucial
in
helping
to
frame
the
constitutional
question.
congress
by
repealing
in
1972,
the
requirement
that
the
states
achieve
a
goal
of
comprehensive
medical
care
by
1975,
left
intact
the
original
intent,
which
was
merely
to
provide
adequate
care.
when
illinois
excludes
medically
necessary
abortions
and
will
only
fund
abortions
necessary
for
preservation
of
life,
it
is
exercising
the
discretion
that
congress
vested
in
it
to
make
these
sort
of
choices.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
the
reasonableness
of
illinois's
exclusion
here,
i
think
hinges
and
part
upon
the
availability
of
alternative
forms
of
treatment
under
one
hand,
and
that
the
type
of
abortions
under,
using
the
doe
versus
bolton
standard,
that
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
have
funded
is
--
are
so
--
the
--
the
definition
are
so
elastic
that
basically
sweeps
into
its
compass,
all
elective
abortions.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
physician
from
utilizing
the
doe
versus
bolton
definition
of
medical
necessity.
in
singling
out
the
factor
for
example
of
age
and
saying
that
that
is
relevant
to
health
and
for
then
authorizing
what
would
be
an
abortion
that
this
court
said
was
not
required
to
be
funded
under
maher
or
under
beal
or
poelker.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
–
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
the
question.
we
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
--
would
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
without
regard
to
the
hyde
amendment
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
i
would
–
i
have
described
what
illinois's
obligations
would
be,
not
with
illinois
has
actually
chosen,
but
what
illinois's
obligations
would
be
under
title
xix
alone,
without
the
hyde
amendment
in
it.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
as
long
as
we
didn't
take
that
final
step
and
unreasonably
exclude
funding
for
all
abortions
because
i
don't
believe
the
state
or
any
state
could
justify
allowing
maternal
deaths.
the
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
that's
a
very
hard
case
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
ever
would
actually
come
down
to
that
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
the
physician
always
has
two
patients
that
he's
looking
out
for
in
pregnancy.
i
suppose
there
had
been
instances
where
in
the
third
trimester,
where
there
is
a
crisis
situation,
the
physician
must
make
a
choice
between
saving
the
life
of
the
woman
or
saving
the
fetus.
but
with
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
i
believe
that
maybe,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
it
--
it
would
be
irrational,
your
honor.
but
what
we
have
here
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
if
there
–
i'm
sure
that
the
numbers
of
the
illinois
general
assembly
were
aware
that
there
were
hard
choices,
but
i
think
that
we
would
never
come
down
to
that
either-or
situation
because
of
the
state's
willingness
to
fund
alternatives,
number
one.
and
that
the
state's
interest
in
fetal
life
does
not
--
does
not
thereby
necessarily
denigrate
the
state's
interest
in
maternal
health.
the
state
hopes
by
its
policy
to
promote
both
of
those
interests.
if
i
--
if
there
were
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
reply
to
three
points.
the
first
point,
regards
the
record
in
the
case
below
involving
the
effectiveness
of
alternative
treatment.
the
record
does
contain
the
affidavit
of
dr.
jasper
williams
at
the
appendix
97.
and
dr.
williams
did
state
in
his
affidavit
that
alternatives
to
abortion
were
available,
which
were
effective
and
as
effective,
the
state
submits
that
no
purposeful
discrimination
is
intended
by
the
illinois
general
assembly
to
harm
the
state's
interest
or
the
interest
in
maternal
health.
this
is
also
supported
in
the
appendix
138
by
a
survey
put
together
by
the
center
for
disease
control.
that
survey
concluded
that
there
was
no
increase
in
abortion-related
complications,
observed
after
the
implementation
of
the
hyde
amendment
in
the
project.
it
is
the
willingness
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
fund
alternatives
to
abortion
which
we
believe
satisfies
within
the
context
of
a
non-comprehensive
medical
assistance
program
for
the
indigent,
the
standard
of
reasonableness.
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
the
equal
protection
discrimination
that
i
understand
the
plaintiffs
were
making
is
that
illinois
has
selected
out
of
all
the
necessary
medical
categories
of
care,
solely
medically
necessary
abortions.
we
have
argued
--
mr.
william
a.
wenzel,
iii
and
does
finance
alternatives,
but
that
is
not
an
accurate
statement
of
illinois'
practice,
nor
is
an
inaccurate
statement
of
illinois'
obligations
under
the
medicaid
act.
illinois
can,
as
this
court
recognized
in
beal,
select
which
procedures
to
fund.
the
court
expressly
stated
that
the
state
need
not
fund
each
and
every
kind
of
care
or
each
of
every
procedure
available.
it
is
that
discretion
within
the
medicaid
program,
coupled
with
illinois'
reasonable
--
reasonable
efforts
to
fund
alternatives
to
complications
of
pregnancy,
which
satisfies
the
rational
basis
test
for
equal
protection
purposes.
the
second
point
we
want
to
make
is
that
contrary
to
the
suggestions
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
hyde
amendment
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
logically
and
we
feel
inextricably
interrelated
with
plaintiff's
statutory
claims.
it
was
placed
in
issue
by
all
of
the
defendants
and
emotions
for
summary
judgment.
and
finally,
it
is
before
this
court
insofar
as
the
final
judgment
order
on
review,
incorporated
the
statutory
rulings.
thank
you.
