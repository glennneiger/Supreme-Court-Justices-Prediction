mr.
wenzel,
i
wonder
if
â€“
i
just
like
to
test
that
for
a
moment.
if
there
is
a
choice
that
has
to
be
made,
when
it's
terribly
difficult
situation
or
either
the
fetus
or
the
mother
has
to
die,
would
you
say
it
was
irrational
for
the
state
to
say
the
choice
should
be
made
in
favor
of
the
fetus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
issue
in
the
--
in
the
case
as
just
been
argued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let's
say
the
state
makes
a
choice.
the
state
passed
a
law
and
says
that
in
all
those
cases,
the
choice
shall
be
made
in
favor
of
the
fetus.
would
that
be
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
or
would
be.
anything
--
maybe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
precisely
the
state
interest
on
which
the
united
states
relies
in
the
previous
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rosenblum,
before
you
sit
down
there
is
one
--
one
point
of
clarification,
you
have
argued
that
the
unduly
burdens
of
interference
test
is
not
met
that
there's
no
interference
whatsoever
here.
are
you
therefore
arguing
that
there
really
is
no
call
for
any
equal
protection
analysis
when
one
differentiates
between
different
kinds
medically
necessary
service
that
there's
does
even
have
to
be
in
irrational
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bennett,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
program
was
a
holocaust
for
money,
because
they
deny
funding
for
abortions.
is
the
--
does
the
record
establish
that
because
it's
entirely
possible
that
there
would
be
fewer
than
the
number
of
unfunded
abortions,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
all
those
went
to
full
term.
there
could
be
abortions
that
were
obtained
by
the
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
not
just
the
comparison
between
abortion
and
--
and
childbirth,
but
the
total
program
is
more
expensive
because
of
this
exception.
