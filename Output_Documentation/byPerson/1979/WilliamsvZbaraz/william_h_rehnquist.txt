when
you
say
joint
assistance,
you
mean
then
partial
reimbursement
from
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenblum,
let
me
post
here
the
same
question
as
i
asked
one
of
the
earlier
counsel
about
the
stanley
versus
georgia
and
reidel
cases,
which
were
decided
within
two
or
three
years
of
each
other.
one
held
that
there
was
a
right
to
–
and
read
in
your
own
living
room
obscene
material,
anything
else
that
you
could
get
a
hold
of.
two
or
three
years
later,
the
same
court
held
that
although
you
have
that
right,
the
government
could
prevent
shipment
for
that
purpose
and
prevent
you
in
effect,
from
getting
a
hold
of
some
types
of
that
literature.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
the
court's
ruling
in
roe
based
on
privacy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenblum,
how
about
the
language
in
article
1
of
the
constitution
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
public
treasury,
save
in
exercise
of
the
act
--
execution
of
an
act
of
congress.
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bennett,
when
you
say
the
record,
i
take
it,
you
mean
the
record
before
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
--
either
the
congress
or
the
illinois
legislature
had
--
had
legislative
hearings
on
this
and
found
conflicting
evidence,
some
of
it
supporting
of
evidence
found
in
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
some
of
it
exactly
contrary
and
the
committee
report
a
bill
of
--
which
was
--
was
the
hyde
amendment.
do
you
think
that
the
northern
district
of
illinois
could
then
hold
its
own
hearing,
hear
these
same
witnesses
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
bill
was
rational
or
whether
or
not,
one
witness
was
to
believe,
to
be
believed
and
the
other,
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
it
have
to
appear
on
the
face
of
some
sort
of
piece
of
paper
that
they
have
a
health
concern
in
mind
in
order
to
say
that
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
the
legislators
have
gone
back
to
there
various
constituencies
and
talked
to
the
people
who
voted
for
or
against
the
person
who
represent
that
district
and
acquired
information
in
that
manner,
would
you
say
that
was
totally
irrelevant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
did
--
but
isn't
the
hyde
amendment
a
much
more
specific
statutory
enactment
than
the
one
you've
referred
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
really
make
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
dickerson
case
in
310
u.s.?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bennett,
i
am
a
little
bit
confused
in
the
same
way
my
brother
white
is.
is
this
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
white
[laughs].
is
this
a
--
is
this
a
statutory
as
opposed
to
a
constitutional
argument
that
you're
making
now
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
or
is
it
a
constitutional
argument,
but
somewhat
different
than
the
other
parties
have
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
my
question
could
be
answered
yes
or
no.
i
mean
whether
this
is
a
constitutional
argument
you
are
now
advancing
or
whether
it's
a
statutory
argument
that
really
there
isn't
any
constitutional
question
here
for
us
to
decide
because
the
hyde
amendment
didn't
change
the
requirements
of
the
medicaid
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
were
you
advancing
at
the
time
mr.
justice
white
asked?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
the
easiest
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
easy
to
see
in
the
case
of
the
bill
of
rights
where
you
can't
say
that
because
appointed
counsel
costs
so
much,
the
--
the
state
legislatures
are
going
to
get
together
and
say,
“we're
not
going
to
point
it
in
the
state
and
therefore,
we're
not
irrational
and
therefore,
this
is
okay.”
obviously,
that
would
be
the
wrong
result
because
that
is
specifically
proscribed
in
the
sixth
amendment.
but
when
you
come
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
this
in
--
and
the
standard
is
the
so-called
rational
basis,
then
to
say
that
the
legislature
has
in
mind
a
--
a
goal
which
is
perfectly
acceptable,
but
was
totally
irrational
in
pursuing
it,
to
--
to
my
mind,
it
does
mean
that
--
that
they
belong
in
a
bughouse.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
if
the
illinois
legislature
had
said
that,
“we
will
fund
all
treatments
medical
--
medically
necessary,
except
for
rabies
and
that
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
from
evidence
that
the
chances
of
survival
of
rabies
are
1
in
100,
once
a
person
gets
it.
and
we
just
don't
want
to
spend
our
money
there,
money
can
be
--
a
lot
of
money
can
be
spent
that
way
and
it
just
isn't
worth
it,
even
though
what
we
realized
that
people
will
--
might
recover,
if
they
--
if
they
were
treated
of,
but
it
would
only
1
out
of
100.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
say
that
although
the
state
has
adopted
both
the
affirmative
and
the
negative
part,
the
negative
part
simply
is
inconsistent
with
the
affirmative
part?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where
it
amounts
to,
isn't
it?
