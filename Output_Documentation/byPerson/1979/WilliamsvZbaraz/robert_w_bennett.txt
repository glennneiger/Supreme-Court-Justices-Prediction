mr.
robert
w.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
unlike
the
solicitor
general,
appellant,
miller,
and
the
intervening
appellants,
crossover
the
central
fact
established
by
the
record,
both
appellant,
miller,
and
the
intervenors
suggest
in
there
brief
that
--
nothing
much
is
at
stake
here.
to
read
their
briefs
and
those
of
their
amici
and
to
listen
to
their
arguments,
one
would
conclude
that
pregnancy
for
the
diabetic,
the
cancer
sufferer,
for
women
with
hypertension,
with
sickle
cell
decease,
with
severe
varicosities
poses
no
unusual
problem.
all
we
are
dealing
with
here
to
listen
to
them
is
with
women
who
desire
an
abortion
for
convenience
and
with
doctors
who
simply
like
to
abort.
the
record
reveals
a
very
different
picture,
one
of
multiple
diseases
and
conditions
posing
very
serious,
but
not
immanently
life-threatening
health
problems
for
the
pregnant
woman,
where
the
option
of
an
early
abortion
is
medically
essential.
delay
in
abortion
rapidly
increases
risk.
the
record
reveals
that
withdrawing
the
medical
option
of
abortion
will
hit
poor
women
and
indigent
teenagers
especially
hard.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
under
the
constitutional
test,
i
would
assume
that
the
legislature
would
be
given
the
benefit
of
serious
factual
doubts
and
that
that
would
be
the
duty
of
the
district
court.
under
the
statutory
standard,
the
federal
statute
entrusts
those
judgments
to
professional
standard
review
organizations.
but
i
would
point
out
that
we
have
no
such
question
here.
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
the
legislature
had
any
health
concern,
what
were
health
question
in
mind,
when
it
pass
the
statute,
it
did.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
on
the
face,
but
then,
evidence
about
whether
there
was
a
plausible
argument
for
such
a
health
interest
would
be
admissible
in
the
district
court.
in
this
case,
we
do
have
paper
and
the
state
is
very
clear
about
the
interest
it
was
serving,
it
was
attempting
to
stop
abortions
and
it
cared
not
about
health
or
life
of
pregnant
women.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
the
very
process
of
constitutional
adjudication
unless
facts
are
to
be
entirely
relevant
--
irrelevant
to
constitutional
adjudication
must
rely
upon
the
adducing
of
factual
evidence
in
a
court.
as
i
said,
it
--
if
there
is
a
debatable
issue,
the
legislature
would
clearly
have
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
here,
there
is
no
debatable
issue.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
would
--
i
would
never
make
such
--
such
sort
of
cosmic
judgment.
but
here
we
do
have
a
statement
by
the
legislature
itself.
in
legislation
passed
1975
and
again
in
1979,
still
on
the
books,
embraced
by
the
attorney
for
the
state
in
his
brief
as
a
statement
of
the
state's
interest
in
as
he
puts
it,
fetal
life.
and
that
is
in
the
legislation,
it
is
quoted
in
his
brief
and
in
ours.
the
legislature
makes
it
clear
that
what
it
was
doing
was
trying
to
effectuate
the
judgment
that
life
begins
at
--
at
conception
and
that
the
fetus
has
the
right
to
life
from
the
moment
of
conception.
on
the
merits,
appellees
rely
on
a
federal
statutory
and
the
federal
constitutional
argument
that
illinois's
withdrawal
of
medicaid
funding
for
medically
necessary
abortions,
is
illegal.
the
statutory
argument
has
two
aspects,
first,
the
state's
obligation
under
title
xix,
the
medicate
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
and
if
--
and
second,
the
effect
if
any,
of
the
annual
appropriations
measures
that
have
been
referred
to
here
as
the
hyde
amendments,
smith
and
jones
amendments,
occasionally.
on
the
title
xix
question,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
illinois
was
required
to
provide
funding
for
all
medically
necessary
abortions
under
its
medical
assistance
programs.
a
dozen
other
lower
courts
have
reached
essentially
the
same
conclusion.
a
state
medicaid
plan
is
required
by
title
xix,
to
provide
for
the
inclusion
of
at
least
the
first
five
services
included
in
section
1396d
(a).
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
your
honors,
we
urge
that
a
statutory
ground
here
is
available
to
the
court
as
an
alternative
ground
for
decision.
i
will
simply
characterize
each
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
where
is
that
statutory
ground
came
from.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct.
as
i
was
--
as
i
was
saying,
the
state
medicaid
plan
used
it
or
the
--
the
federal
medicaid
statute
uses
mandatory
language
to
express
a
minimal
state
obligation.
that
to
provide
at
least
the
first
five
services
listed
in
section
1396d
(a).
those
mandatory
services
include
physician
services,
inpatient
and
outpatient
hospital
services
and
early
and
periodic
screening
for
children.
all
the
services
that
is
necessary
to
provide
medically
necessary
abortions.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
the
hyde
amendment
is
a
very
specific
statutory
amendment.
our
argument
with
regard
to
it
is
that
it
does
precisely
what
its
words
specifically
say,
that
is
to
say,
restrict
the
use
of
federal
funds
and
say
nothing
about
the
state's
obligation
under
title
xix.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
of
course
there
are
multiple
opinions
from
this
court
and
others
that
the
duty
of
a
court
is
to
follow
the
plain
meaning
of
statutory
language.
there
is
an
exception
stated
to
that
and
that
is
when
there
would
be
absurd
result
produced
by
following
that
language,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
absurd
result
here.
congress
was
acting
in
a
particular
context.
the
context
of
appropriations
and
it
took
a
particular
action
and
its
words
are
very
clear
about
what
it
intended
to
bring
about
by
that
action.
in
--
in
those
circumstances,
we
argue
that
there
really
is
no
need
to
look
to
legislative
history
at
all
in
order
to
determine
what
affect
the
hyde
amendment
has
on
the
state's
title
xix
obligation.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes,
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes,
there
have
been
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
a
couple
of
lower
courts
that
have.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
oh
--
oh,
yes,
i
do
recall
the
dickerson
case.
actually,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
there,
the
intent
to
repeal
was
a
manifest,
the
intent
to
impliedly
amend
a
statute.
here
we
have
examples.
we
have
cited
a
number
in
our
brief.
the
solicitor
general
has
offered
some
others,
in
which
there
is
not
the
assumed
congruence
between
the
funding
formula
under
this
cooperative
federal
state
programs
and
underlying
substantive
obligations.
congressman
hyde
himself,
in
the
course
of
the
debates,
bemoaned
on
occasion,
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
get
the
substantive
questions
constitutional
amendments,
the
social
security
act,
before
congress.
and
so,
the
congress
was
acting
in
a
particular
context
that
of
appropriations.
it's
--
if
--
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
order
to
determine
what
congress
accomplished
by
passing
words
that
are
quite
clear,
that
legislative
history
really
reinforces
the
conclusion
we
are
urging.
what
members
of
congress
most
frequently
said
was
that
they
are
restrict
--
restricting
the
use
of
federal
funds.
congress
knows
how
to
amend
the
social
security
act
if
it
wants
to.
the
bowman
amendment
which
has
recently
passed
the
house
and
is
now
in
the
senate,
an
amendment
to
the
child
health
assurance
act,
says
and
i
quote,
“nothing
in
title
xix
shall
be
construed
to
require
any
state
to
--
funds
to
be
used
to
pay
for
any
abortion.”
the
hyde
amendment
could
have
said
that,
but
it
did
not
and
this
court's
quite
recent
decision
in
tva
against
hill.
counsel
strongly
against
finding
an
implied
amendment
of
an
underlying
substantive
statute
brought
about
by
an
appropriations
act.
the
equal
protection
clause
commands
the
same
result.
our
claim
here
is
depicted
by
the
appellants
as
a
claim
for
affirmative
subsidy
of
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right.
but
the
appellees,
the
plaintiffs
here
are
making
no
claim
for
an
affirmative
subsidy
for
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right.
their
claim
is
not
to
be
discriminated
against
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
state
medical
care
statutes
just
as
much
as
it
applies
to
any
other
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant's
constitutional
arguments
are
premised
on
an
attempt
to
identify
this
case
with
the
situation
presented
in
maher
against
roe.
but
this
case
is
not
like
maher
against
roe
and
it
differs
in
ways
that
are
central
to
the
constitutional
analysis
that
is
appropriate.
in
maher,
the
plaintiff
complained
that
the
state
favored
normal
childbirth
over
abortion
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
permissible
to
express
a
value
judgment
in
favor
of
childbirth.
the
value
judgment
was
expressed
by
use
of
a
medical
assistance
program
in
which
refusal
to
fund
elective
abortions
did
no
violence
whatsoever
to
the
medical
assistance
goals
on
which
that
program
was
grounded.
if
a
woman
desiring
an
abortion
could
not
obtain
one,
she
could
go
through
normal
childbirth
with
all
medically
necessary
expenses
paid
and
neither
her
life
nor
her
health
will
be
put
in
jeopardy.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
guess
i'm
--
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
if
the
hyde
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
if
the
hyde
amendment,
your
honor,
modified
the
state's
obligations
under
title
xix,
then
i
would
agree
that
the
totality
of
the
state
judgment
and
the
federal
judgment
was
one
which
excluded
those
procedures.
that's
clear,
but
that
would
be
true
of
any
state
discriminatory
action.
that
does
not
prevent
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
equal
protection
analysis.
indeed,
the
constitution
commands
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
situation
in
maher.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
in
--
in
maher,
the
state
could
express
a
value
judgment,
but
do
no
violence
to
any
health
goals,
do
no
violence
to
the
general
area
of
activity
in
which
it
itself
had
decided
that
it
would
undertake
a
very
substantial
program.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i'm
sure
that
in
some
sense,
congress
expressed
a
value
judgment.
indeed,
i
think
congress
expressed
a
pure
sort
of
value
judgment
that
abortions
were
evil
and
hence,
federal
money
was
not
to
be
associated
with
that.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
with
both.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
take
it
that
all
constitutional
arguments
about
discrimination
must
define
the
area
in
which
the
discrimination
takes
place
and
against
which
the
discriminatory
denial
of
a
benefit
must
be
judged.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
advance
both
those
arguments,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
which
the
alternative.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
the
constitutional
argument.
the
state
obviously
has
wide
discretion
to
choose
its
spending
and
regulatory
activity,
but
when
it
does
make
a
choice,
that
choice
defines
the
area
of
discrimination
for
equal
protection
purposes.
and
regardless
of
the
equal
protection
standard
that
is
to
be
applied
here,
what
illinois
has
done
cannot
stand.
the
abortion
decision
centrally
touches
the
health
of
indigent
pregnant
women.
that
theme
has
been
reiterated
time
and
again
in
this
court's
decisions.
and
indeed
the
two
or
three
provisions
in
abortion
regulations
that
have
been
upheld,
have
all
been,
i
would
submit,
carefully
sculpted
so
as
to
avoid
any
serious
jeopardy
to
the
pregnant
woman's
health.
here,
illinois
refuses
to
fund
medically
necessary
abortions
in
pursuit,
i
would
submit,
of
no
legitimate
interest
at
all.
this
court
has
found
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
potential
life.but
illinois
was
not
attempting
to
protect
potential
life.
what
illinois
was
doing
was
trying
to
prevent
abortions
with
the
view
that
a
fetus
was
a
human
life
in
same
sense
that
a
two-year-old
was
and
in
the
same
sense
that
a
22
and
a
44-year-old
was.
if
roe
against
wade
stands
for
any
proposition,
it
must
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
state
cannot
proceed
on
that
assumption,
when
proceeding
on
that
assumption
will
do
substantial
harm
to
the
interest
of
others
involved.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
your
honor,
the
equal
protection
standards
and
the
due
process
standards
are
obviously
closely
related.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
we
make
no
such
claim.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
it
is
a
claim
of
discriminatory
denial
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
of
public
benefits.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
for
all
medically
necessary
procedures.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
is
not
just
any
discrimination
that
the
state
has
undertaken
here.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes,
but
it's
not
even
an
ordinary
unconstitutional
discrimination.
because
the
discrimination
here
is
against
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right,
a
right
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
to
be
fundamental.that
is
the
woman's
interest
in
making
the
abortion
decision
for
herself.
illinois
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
maher
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct.
and
we
are
not
claiming
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
maher
there
was
no
discrimination
in
a
--
in
the
sense
that
the
equal
protection
clause
makes
relevant,
because
there
was
no
jeopardy
to
the
healthcare
interest
that
the
state
had
defined
for
itself,
whereas
here,
there
is
disastrous
significance.
the
state
will
fund
all
other
medically
necessary
procedures,
but
these,
it
will
not.
and
that
is
precisely
a
discrimination
based
on
the
woman's
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
it
might
well,
your
honor,
if
it
had
a
rational
basis.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
i
would
have
to
no
know
more
about
both
drug
addiction
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
understand.
most
state
decisions
to
fund
or
not
to
fund,
are
justifiable
by
a
value
judgment
in
choosing
between
two
goals.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
would
think
they
might
well
be
able
to.
i
--
without
knowing
more
about
the
particulars
of
alcoholism
and
narcotics
addiction,
i
--
i
hesitate
to
make
an
unequivocal
judgment,
but
my
hunch
would
be
that
a
state
could
make
such
a
distinction.
and
it
would
be
justifiable
by
the
value
judgment
that
alcoholism
is
a
more
significant
problem
or
less,
depending
on
how
the
judgment
came
out,
in
our
society
than
was
drug
addiction.
but,
the
state
here
is
acting
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
impermissible,
namely,
that
abortion
is
to
be
stopped
and
yet
the
--
and
the
people
who's
desired
abortion,
the
state
has
chosen
to
stop
and
discriminate
against
are
those
of
a
helpless
group
of
indigent
citizens,
those
that
the
legislative
process
most
easily
can
ignore
when
it
decides
to
launch
upon
a
discrimination.
justice
rehnquist
asked
this
morning,
whether
one
had
to
assume
that
legislators
were
irrational
in
order
to
decide
that
they
had
adopted
an
irrational
means
to
the
pursuit
of
a
legitimate
objective.
i
would
point
out
first
of
all
that
there
is
no
legitimate
objective
here,
but
even
if
there
were
a
legitimate
objective
that
the
illinois
legislature
had
in
mind,
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
assume
that
legislators
may
or
did
have
acted
irrationally
as
individuals,
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
constitutional
test
of
irrationality
is
met.
ever
since
james
madison
and
probably
a
long
time
before,
our
constitutional
theorists
recognized
that
a
legislative
majority
would
often
be
tempted
to
ignore
utterly
the
interest
of
a
legislative
minority.
and
the
judgment
on
a
legislative
level
that
the
costs
that
have
been
exacted
from
a
minority
are
too
great
is
what
justifies
the
conclusion
that
what
the
legislature
has
done
isn't
an
irrational
means
to
pursuit,
even
of
legitimate
objectives.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
after
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
forgive
me,
your
honor.
i
read
your
dissent
in
weinberger
against
--
or
your
concurrence
in
weinberger
against
wiesenfeld
to
reach
exactly
that
conclusion
about
the
discrimination
there.
i
don't
understand
how
a
state
could
ever
have
a
legitimate
objective
and
there
could
be
any
content
to
the
requirement
that
they
pursue
a
rational
means
unless
this
court
at
some
level
was
willing
to
make
a
judgment
that
the
state
had
simply
gone
too
far
in
exacting
cost
from
a
helpless
political
minority.
i
take
it
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
rational
basis
test
both
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
under
the
due
process
clause
means.
but
i
would
repeat
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
an
ordinary
--
even
an
ordinary
unconstitutional
discrimination,
but
rather
a
discrimination
against
a
woman's
exercise
of
her
fundamental
rights.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes,
the
district
court
--
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
think
that
the
district
court's
language
sort
of
straddled
the
--
the
two
conclusions.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
the
district
court
did
characterize
what
the
state
had
done
as
illegitimate.
it
said
it
had
no
legitimate
interest
in
favoring
potential
life
at
the
expense
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
articulate
its
conclusion
in
those
terms.
it
subsumed
its
conclusion
of
illegitimacy
--
within
its
conclusion
of
illegitimacy,
it
has
subsumed
an
articulation
of
the
interest
that
the
state
was
ignoring
here.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
the
roe
against
wade
and
doe
against
bolton
did
recognize
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
furthering
potential
life,
but
the
--
those
opinions
also
addressed
the
balance
that
a
state
was
permitted
to
make.
and
even
in
the
third
trimester,
when
the
state's
interest
was
held
there
to
be
compelling
and
concluded
that
even
in
that
third
trimester,
a
state
could
not
forbid
abortion
when
that
would
post
jeopardy
to
the
pregnant
woman's
life
or
health.
that
i
think
is
essentially
equivalent
to
the
exact
rationality
balance
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
make
even
on
the
assumption
that
illinois'
interest
here
was
to
further
potential
life,
which
it
was
not.
illinois
wanted
to
stop
abortions
and
it
was
willing
to
adopt
a
healthcare
funding
program
to
do
that,
because
that
was
the
only
means
that
it
saw
available
to
it.
and
the
victims
of
that
desire
are
precisely
the
most
helpless
of
illinois'
citizens.
maher
against
roe
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct.
you
found
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
furthering
potential
life
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
and
in
expressing
a
value
judgment
in
favor
of
childbirth.
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
potential
life,
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting,
is
not
involved
here
because
illinois
was
not
actually
pursuing
that
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
the
illinois
legislative
records
supports
that
view,
but
you
don't
even
have
to
resort
to
that.illinois
in
1975
and
again
in
1979
adopted
legislation
which
articulates
that
view,
of
when
life
begins
and
of
the
interest
that
it
is
furthering
and
the
state
in
its
brief
embraces
that
as
a
statement
of
what
they
refer
to
as
the
state's
interest
in
fetal
life.
maher
against
roe
as
you
just
indicated
spoke
of
a
state
favoring
normal
childbirth
and
appellants
would
like
to
expand
that
language
to
include
all
childbirth
and
then
claim
that
illinois
is
serving
that
interest,
but
illinois
has
no
actual
interest
in
increasing
the
number
of
unwanted
births.
illinois'
medicaid
program
even
funds
nontherapeutic
sterilizations.
what
illinois
is
doing
is
effectively
coercing
indigent
women
to
have
abnormal
childbirths,
sometimes
resulting
in
death.
the
united
states
argument
is
that
death
is
okay
too.
the
united
states
says
that
it
would
be
perfectly
rational
for
a
state
to
decide
for
the
congress
or
for
the
state
--
for
a
state
to
decide
not
to
fund
any
abortions
under
its
medical
assistance
program.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
do
agree.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
death
is
involved
there,
but
death
is
involved
in
all
sorts
of
things
and
states
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that's
correct.
but
--
but
also,
all
sorts
of
judgments
to
fund
or
not
to
fund
that
a
state
makes,
may
have
implications
for
the
longevity
of
the
population.
but
the
equal
protection
clause
insists
that
we
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
state
discrimination
takes
place.
for
then,
the
state
has
itself,
told
us
of
great
deal
about
the
things
that
it
values
and
here
the
state
has
said,
“for
everyone
else,
health
is
of
surpassing
significance,
but
not
for
this
one
group
that
we
will
disfavor.”
that
is
a
classic,
i
would
submit,
a
classic
case
of
discrimination
where
the
equal
protection
clause
test
comes
into
play.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
there
being
no
fundamental
right
involved,
i
take
it
that
only
the
rational
basis
test
would
then
be
properly
applied
and
that
state
interest
in
conserving
the
fund,
so
as
to
maximize
the
healthcare
benefit
in
its
program,
would
be
a
rational
basis.
i
take
it
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
geduldig,
rested
on
an
analysis
similar
to
that.
but
here,
of
course,
what
illinois
does
cause
the
stray
--
state's
substantial
funds
thus,
not
only
exacerbating
the
health
problems
of
pregnant
women
when
they
cannot
obtain
a
medically
necessary
abortion,
but
of
the
health
problems
of
others
as
well,
because
the
state
--
the
program
actually
cost
more,
because
of
the
refusal
to
fund
medically-necessary
abortions.
so
that
justification,
even
if
it
had
motivated
the
state,
is
not
available
here
and
of
course,
it
did
not
motivate
the
state,
illinois.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
we
make
no
claim
that
there
is
sex
discrimination
here,
for
instance.
though,
i
--
i
would
argue
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
--
actual
real
life
impact
of
the
discrimination
is
relevant
to
the
analysis.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
i
don't
claim
any
special
constitutional
scrutiny
is
involved
here,
because
of
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
the
record
quite
conclusively
establishes
it.
the
state
doesn't
dispute
it.
the
united
states
doesn't
dispute
it.
the
intervenors
do
dispute
it.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
assume
it.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
yes.
well,
i
--
i
understand
the
argument.
now,
mr.
hardy,
made
that
argument
in
an
arizona
law
journal
article
that
the
intervenors
have
repeatedly
relied
upon
although
i
think
that
in
their
most
recent
submissions,
they
have
somewhat
backed
away
from
it
and
perhaps
that's
a
sign
of
the
weakness
of
the
argument.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well,
it
arguably
might,
but
the
amount
of
carelessness
that
it
would
have
to
inhibit
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
well
--
but
it
would
have
to
be
enormous
in
order
to
make
this
action
not
costly
for
the
state.
mr.
hardy's
argument
is
based
on
some
studies
done
in
japan
and
in
eastern
europe
where
abortions
were
made
available
freely,
not
in
response
to
medical
necessity.
and
even
there,
the
mathematics
that
he
employs
comes
out
a
little
strain.
we
addressed
this
argument
at
more
length
in
some
of
our
briefs
in
the
lower
court
and
our
brief
in
this
court
does
refer
to
those
submissions
which
are
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
it
could
be.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
state
has
to
make
judgements
about
some
activities
it
will
undertake
and
others
that
it
will
not.
here,
the
state
has
made
that
judgment
and
it
is
within
the
context
--
within
a
state-defined
context
that
the
discrimination
takes
place.
if
drug
addiction
problem
were
part
of
a
larger
hole
in
which
it
made
sense
to
view
it
as
an
integral
part
of
that
larger
hole
and
the
state
discriminated
it
against
drug
addiction,
then
we
would
have
the
classical
equal
protection
questions
presented.
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
when
the
state
discriminates
--
mr.
robert
w.
bennett
no.
here,
the
negative
part,
i
–
i
repeat,
is
in
the
service
of
an
illegitimate
interest.
but
if
we
were
to
assume
that
it
was
in
pursuit
of
a
legitimate
interest,
then
the
state
would
be
permitted
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
call
upon
that
interest
in
order
to
provide
the
justification
for
the
discrimination,
but
that
is
–
but
the
judgment
of
whether
you
have
a
sufficiently
rational
relationship
to
the
pursuit
of
a
legitimate
interest
is
one
of
the
equal
protection
clause
commands
this
--
this
court
to
make.
the
united
states'
understanding
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
context
of
a
funding
program
such
as
this,
i
submit,
drains
that
clause
of
all
human
content.
but
legislation
serves
human
ends
and
its
rationality
must
be
judged
in
terms
of
human
cause.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
your
honor,
with
the
reasons
stated,
i
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
