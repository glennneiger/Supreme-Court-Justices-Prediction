mr.
rosenblum,
it
might
take
that
the
â€“
the
solicitor
general
does
not
join
you
in
this
argument.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
--
may
i
ask
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
come
to
the
question
i
was
about
to
ask.
you
are
arguing
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
is
no
legitimate
state
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
--
did
the
district
court
in
your
case,
agree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
--
i
understood
the
district
court
recognized
a
legitimate
state
interest,
i
--
i
understood
the
district
court
recognized
a
legitimate
state
interest,
but
weighed
it
against
the
interest
of
--
for
which
you're
advocating.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
can't
point
any
language
in
the
district
court
that
goes
as
far
as
you
have
gone,
can
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
no
legitimate
interest
in
--
in
--
no
legitimate
--
none
of
the
legitimate
interest
identified
by
the
solicitor
general?
he
identified
two
primarily
that
is
a
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
the
state
interest
in
--
in
bringing
a
--
a
fetus
to
a
normal
type
birth
and
the
state
interest
in
not
expending
public
funds
to
further
a
cause
which
a
large
segment
of
population
perceives
to
be
an
immoral
one.
i'm
not
passing
out
my
judgment
on
those
interests.
i'm
just
asking
whether
or
not,
the
district
court
below
in
this
case,
found
no
such
state
interest.
