mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
the
position
of
the
united
states
on
this
matter
is
a
limited
one
at
this
point,
because
historical
events
have
caught
up
with
us.
we
appear
principally
here
because
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
was
instructed
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
hyde
amendments
which
had
not
been
drawn
in
the
controversy
before.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
claim
that
they
were
harmed
at
all
by
reason
of
the
hyde
amendment
and
the
district
court
obedient
to
the
mandate,
considered
it.
but
nobody
was
contending
that
it
impinged
on
any
right
of
his.
and
it's
been
our
position
in
this
matter
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
of
--
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
and
because
of
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
appropriate
step
for
this
court
today,
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
extent
that
it
declares
a
hyde
amendment
unconstitutional.
and
we
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
do
that,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
and
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
that's
been
allotted
to
the
government,
in
case
some
other
interest
appears
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
do
not
make
that
argument.
no,
we
do
not.
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
thought
that
the
court
certainly
can
and
we
suggested
that
it
might
in
the
discretion
do
so.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
because
i
do
not
wish
to
permit
two
assertions
to
go
unanswered.
one
assertion
that
was
made
was
that
the
united
states
says
that
death
is
--
is
okay.
and
i
think
this
was
the
contention
that
i
heard.
this,
of
course,
is
not
so.
the
other
related
contention
was
that
the
united
states
places
fetal
life
above
maternal
life
and
that
explicitly
is
not
so,
because
the
first
exception
in
the
hyde
amendment
provides
that
funding
is
available
when
the
life
of
the
mother
would
be
endangered,
if
the
fetus
were
brought
to
term.
the
second
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that,
since
the
entire
medicaid
act
was
passed
to
help
indigents
drawing
a
line
within
the
program,
then
doesn't
punish
any
of
them.
with
those
two
comments,
we
will
rest
on
our
brief.
