even
though
--
even
though
some
–
even
in
a
great
many
cases
absent
in
abortion,
there
would
be
a
serious
health
risk
to
the
potential
mother.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rosenblum,
what
was
the
case
or
controversy
between
your
clients
and
the
plaintiffs?
are
you
intervened
--
these
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
should
you
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
was
granted,
but
i
wondered
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
taxpayers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
would
have
given
him
a
standing
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
--
i
know,
but
that's
a
question.
it's
always
been
around.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
–
maybe
the
mirror
image,
but
you
mean
as
just
the
–-
just
the
opposite.
what
do
you
mean
as
i
didn't
have
an
economic
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
–-
that
was
the
approach
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
--
how
about
a
state?
how
about
--
how
about
directing
in
state
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
involving
it?
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
what
if
there's
a
declaration
that
the
illinois
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
we
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
could
we
attempt
to
--
could
--
would
we
have
the
power
to
direct
them
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what's
your
position
--
what's
your
submission
on
that
question?
would
--
would
we
have
the
power
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
suggest
i
take
it
in
your
brief
that
we
would
still
entertain
and
reach
the
question
about
the
state
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
--
are
you
--
you're
--
you're
addressing
yourself
to
the
--
the
decision
of
the
court
appeals
on
--
or
when
it
--
ordered
a
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
but
it
--
it
isn't
something
that
we've
granted
certiorari
on
it.
something
--
you're
--
you're
just
urging
that
as
an
appellee
to
support
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
what
the
medical
goals
as
the
fact
are?
what
if
--
what
if
we
decided
like
the
district
courts
did
that
it's
not
inconsistent
with
--
with
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
the
hyde
amendment
it's
--
it's
not
inconsistent,
according
to
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
saying
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
wouldn't
be
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
which
is
what
you
were
just
arguing.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
were.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
maher
--
it's
maher
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
said
that
--
said
that
congress
could
do
that
or
a
state
could
do
it
in
the
first
trimester,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
none
of
that
--
it
-
it
said
as
a
--
congress
needn't
--
needn't
fund
elective
abortion.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
can't
--
even
though
it
trespasses
on
the
results
and
the
inability,
practical
inability
of
a
woman
to
make
her
own
decision.
