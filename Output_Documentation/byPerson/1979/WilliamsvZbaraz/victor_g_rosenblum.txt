mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
intervenors
in
both
cases,
but
i
am
addressing
myself
to
the
zbaraz
case
this
morning
and
in
the
course
of
the
limited
time
that
i
have,
i
hope
to
be
able
to
address
the
nature
of
the
right
to
privacy
within
the
context
of
the
constitution
and
whether
the
hyde
amendment
infringes
on
that
right
especially
through
penalty
analysis
and
i
hope
also
to
be
able
to
address
the
appropriations
issue
which
raises
another
theory
of
constitutional
issue
for
this
court,
that
at
a
minimum
would
counsel
restraint.
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
right
to
privacy,
may
i
point
out
that
the
court's
use
of
the
term,
“a
child
birth”
in
the
maher
decision
was
used
interchangeably
with
the
language
of
normal
childbirth.
so
for
example,
at
--
at
page
474
of
the
u.s.
reports
in
--
in
maher,
the
court
had
said
that
it
implies
no
limitation
on
the
authority
of
a
state
to
make
a
value
judgment
favoring
childbirth
over
abortion
and
to
implement
that
judgment
by
the
allocation
of
public
funds.
it
is
our
position
that
the
–
that
at
least
to
that
time
that
the
use
of
childbirth
and
normal
childbirth
when
used
by
the
court
interchangeably
and
that
in
any
event
the
--
the
court's
ruling
was
with
regard
to
their
being
no
limitation
on
the
authority
of
the
state
to
make
a
value
judgment
favoring
childbirth.
similarly,
with
regard
to
the
--
the
maher
test
of
the
–
the
maher
test
is
–
as
we
understand,
was
a
test
that
used
three
words
as
the
standard.
the
words
of
unduly,
burdensome,
interference,
an
adverb,
an
adjective
and
a
noun
and
we
would
take
the
position
that
with
all
respect
that
the
adverb
is
not
violated,
that
the
adjective
is
not
violated
and
that
the
noun
standing
alone
is
not
violated
either,
that
there
is
indeed,
no
interference
by
the
state
or
by
congress
here
with
the
defined
right
to
privacy.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
we'd
like
the
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
that
is
the
very
essence
of
the
difference
between
the
court's
ruling
in
roe
and
the
court's
ruling
in
maher
and
that
–
but
it
is
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
yes
--
no,
the
court's
--
the
court's
ruling
in
roe
was
indeed
based
upon
privacy
and
that
ruling
in
--
in
maher
was
based
upon
entitlement
and
there
is
a
vast
sea
of
difference
between
the
issue
of
--
of
privacy
in
roe
as
it
bears
upon
the
exercise
of
a
prohibition
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
the
privacy
issue
as
it
bears
upon
the
matter
of
entitlement,
for
there
was
indeed
an
impingement
upon
privacy
as
the
court
found
in
roe
because
there
was
prohibition
in
the
case
of
maher
and
in
the
present
case.
there
is
no
prohibition
upon
the
woman's
right.
there
is
no
denial
of
a
benefit
on
a
basis
that
infringes
the
right
to
privacy
in
any
way.
there's
no
pledge
of
allegiance
or
statement
of
beliefs
that's
required
to
keep
a
job.
there's
no
switching
of
political
party
or
legions
that
is
required
in
this
instance.
there
is
no
fining,
there
is
no
retaliation.
the
woman
is
completely
free
to
procure
an
abortion
without
recrimination
of
any
kind
and
free
to
advocate
abortion
to
the
fullest
that
she
may
wish.
and
finally,
there
is
no
coercion
in
any
sense
of
belief.
there
is
in
the
fullest
sense
in
the
legislation
involved
here,
the
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
legislatures
of
that
basic
right
to
privacy
in
the
classical
brandeis
notion.
the
woman
is
indeed
being
left
alone.
she
is
in
no
different
a
position
after
the
legislation
than
she
was
before
the
legislation
with
regard
to
the
exercise
of
that
right.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
that
–-
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
but
--
but
that
will
be
a
100%
correlation
with
the
original
conception
of
the
right
to
privacy,
that
is,
it
is
the
right
to
be
left
alone.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
but
even
–
even
preceding,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
the
constitutional
determination.
the
test
that
was
established
by
this
court
for
interference
is
that
test
of
an
unduly
burdensome
interference.
so
presumably,
the
court
would
still
allow
even
an
interference
and
we
would
assert
that
in
this
instance,
there
is
not
even
that.
that
there
is
the
full
regard
and
the
full
preservation
of
the
woman's
right
to
privacy
in
this
instance,
that
penalty
analysis
consequently
is
peculiarly
inappropriate
in
the
type
of
a
situation
in
which
there
is
full
respect
of
the
exercise
of
that
interest.
now,
if
the
position
that
is
advocated
by
the
plaintiffs
were
to
prevail
here,
the
legislature
would
be
reduced
to
the
position
of
implementing
a
notion
of
neutral
principles.
there
would
be
no
purpose
served
in
having
election
or
there
would
be
no
purpose
served
in
stimulating
people
to
participate
in
those
elections,
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
consequence
would
be
that
it
would
make
no
difference
because
anytime
a
legislature
wished
to
exercise
the
initiative
or
make
the
value
judgment
to
fund
a,
it
would
be
required
at
the
same
time
to
fund
non-a
or
anti-a
and
consequently
to
reduce
the
legislature
to
engaging
in
mere
empty
rituals.
now,
i
would
like
for
a
moment
also
to
be
able
to
address
the
question
of
the
special
problem
involved
in
the
appropriations
issue.
now,
this
is
really
an
appropriation's
question,
that
with
all
due
respect,
our
intervenor's
view
as
significantly
different
from
what
the
court
faced
in
the
califano
against
westcott
case.
this
is
indeed
a
case
in
which
congress'
appropriations
power
under
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that
is
our
understanding,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
that
the
solicitor
general
is
–
is
representing
the
secretary
of
--
of
the
hew
and
our
intervening
clients
have
a
--
an
additional
view
on
this
subject.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
yes,
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
believe
furthermore,
that
this
was
a
--
a
subject
that
this
court
assisted
significantly
the
legislature
with
in
the
–-
in
its
decision
in
baker
against
carr
in
its
progeny.
that
it
is
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
court
helped
the
integrity
of
the
legislative
process
by
assuring
the
fairness
of
apportionment,
a
decision
which
has
been
effectively
implemented
and
counsels
the
additional
recognition
that
value
judgments
are
essentially
for
the
legislature
to
make,
rather
than
for
this
court
to
make
with
regard
to
crucial
and
often
divisive
issues
of
national
policy.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
the
people
through
the
elective
process.
a
process
which
was
significantly
improved
as
i
say,
through
the
decisions
following
this
court's
action
in
baker
against
carr,
when
of
course
there's
is
constitutional
violation,
then
under
the
separation
of
power
system,
this
court
must
assert
its
authority.
but
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
there
is
no
such
occasion
which
calls
for
the
entered
position
of
the
court's
authority.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
we
intervened
as
--
as
defendants
in
the
action,
yes.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
sir,
the
–
the
intervention
was
granted
by
the
–-
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
the
district
courts
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
on
the
grounds
in
the
cases
of
dr.
williams
and
dr.
diamond
that
they
had
an
economic
interest
as
physicians
and
as
taxpayers
in
the
case.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
and
that
–-
well
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
they
did
–
the
emphasis,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
specification
on
the
part
of
the
court
as
we
recall
of
the
precise
reason
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
but
the
economic
interest
argument
was
the
–
was
similar
to,
perhaps
the
mirror
image
of
the
economic
interest
argument
that
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
no,
that
they
did
have
an
economic
interest
because
as
--
as
the
application
(voice
overlap)
and
they
–
and
the
pediatrician
that
they
had
a
–
they
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
continuity
of
--
of
childbirth.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
and
the
continuity
of
clients,
who
would
be
the
product
of
such
childbirth.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that's
indeed
our
understanding.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
now,
with
regard
to
the
--
the
appropriation's
question.
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
situation
in
westcott
is
emphatically
that
in
the
westcott
case,
there
was
agreement
on
the
part
of
all
the
parties,
that
it
was
appropriate
to
reach
the
decision
that
was
reached
there.
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
i'm
talking
here
especially
about
the
issue
of
remedy
and
i'm
talking
here
especially
about
the
issue
of
congress.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that
in
this
respect
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
we're
dealing
--
yes.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that
in
this
respect
we
are
dealing
with
the
appropriations
power
of
the
congress
and
that
while
this
court
does
of
course,
as
it
showed
in
the
levitt
case
that
it
does
has
the
power
to
declare
an
appropriation
act
unconstitutional.
but
nonetheless,
even
in
the
levitt
case,
the
court
did
not
order
funding.
the
court
left
that
matter
for
determination
by
the
congress
and
the
difference
between
the
westcott
case
and
the
present
case
is
that
in
westcott,
there
was
agreement
on
part
of
all
of
the
parties
with
regard
to
the
funding
issue
and
in
this
case
there
is
clearly
not
such
agreement
and
this
would
counsel
additional
restraint
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
invoking
its
constitutional
power.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
--
there
was
i
believe
scrupulous
regard
for
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers
on
this
issue
and
for
the
fact
that
article
1,
clause
9,
subparagraph
7,
reserves
the
funding
power
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
we
are
saying
that
with
that
--
that
the
court
itself,
does
not
have
a
funding
power
the
restraint
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
in
this
case
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
we
would
--
we
would
submit,
no.
that
is
you
may
find
the
--
the
hyde
amendment
unconstitutional.
but
if
the
hyde
amendment
is
found
unconstitutionally
effective,
that
is
that
there
is
--
there
are
no
funds
for
abortion
unless
and
until
congress
appropriates
those
funds.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
i'm
saying,
a
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
i'm
saying
that
in
--
that
in
general
restrain
should
be
counseled
here
with
regard
to
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality
on
the
part
of
congress'
action,
but
that
even
if
there
were
to
be
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
that
the
court
does
indeed,
not
have
the
power
to
order
the
funding.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that
would
be
position
of
the
intervenors,
mr.
justice.
that
this
--
that
the
matter
of
funding
is
reserved
under
the
constitution
and
our
separation
of
power
system
to
congress.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
the
--
the
directing
of
the
state
legislature
involves
another
--
another
issue
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
that
is
well.
it
--
it
could
conceivably
be
involved
here.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
no,
because
the
--
the
question
here
would
come
back
to
the
--
the
question
that
is
more
like
the
question
the
steward
machine,
about
whether
the
state
wishes
to
participate
or
not
in
the
social
security
program.
and
if
the
state
wishes
to
participate,
it
was
indeed
the
--
the
finding
by
the
court
in
steward
machine,
that
there
is
no
coercion
upon
the
state
and
there's
a
vast
difference
of
course,
between
coercion
and
motivation.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
if
there
were
declaration
that
the
illinois
statute
was
unconstitutional
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
it
would
then
be
up
to
illinois
to
decide
whether
it
wished
to
continue
in
the
social
security
program
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
or
not.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
i
think
you
reserve
that
question
in
the
usery
case
that
--
that
at
that
time
you
--
i
believe
in
footnote
17
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
reserved
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
my
--
my
submission
on
the
question,
sir,
would
be
that
--
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
order
the
state
to
do
so
in
that
situation,
because
that
would
place
in
jeopardy
the
federal
system.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
i
believe
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
that
you
do
have
the
power
--
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
--
with
regard
to
the
state.
it
is
not
a
separation
of
powers
issue
as
specifically
spelled
out
under
--
of
the
--
the
first
article
dealing
with
the
legislative
power.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well,
that
--
that
is
of
course
the
very
essence
of
both
the
problem
and
the
strength
of
our
separation
of
power
system.
that
the
--
that
the
uses
of
--
of
restraint
within
that
system
are
expected
to
work
out
political
compromises
and
that
the
uses
of
coercion
have
been
rare
within
that
system
precisely
because
coercion
itself,
is
alien
to
the
success
of
the
political
system.
and
this
is
one
more
reason
for
the
counseling
of
restraint
even
while
the
calling
in
the
question
of
this
court's
power
to
deal
with
the
issue
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
i
view
the
--
the
constitutional
issues
in
the
state
case
and
in
the
prior
case
as
having
great
similarities,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
as
having
some
differences
by
virtue
of
the
difference
between
the
nature
of
the
system
of
separation
of
powers
and
the
system
of
federalism,
these
were
problems
that
were
alluded
to
in
the
usery
case
and
i
believe
the
court
reserved
judgment
on
the
issue
of
the
impact
of
funding
on
the
application
of
usery.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
well
--
well,
that's
what
i
was
relying
on,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
for
the
--
for
the
--
the
special
point
about
the
sanctity
of
the
appropriations
power
of
congress
and
the
inappropriateness
in
response
to
my
--
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
inappropriateness
constitutionally
of
the
court's
making
a
funding
decision
in
this
matter.
mr.
victor
g.
rosenblum
no,
there
is
a
call
for
equal
protection
analysis
and
there
is
a
call
for
the
application
of
the
rational
basis
test.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
it's
per
curiam
decision,
the
rational
basis
test
is
a
--
is
a
more
relaxed
test.
and
under
that
relaxed
test
of
rationality,
what
is
looked
for
first
is
the
--
the
rational
decision
which
the
court
found
in
roe
to
--
to
be
a
--
at
least
a
rational
matter
for
concern
for
the
life
of
the
fetus.
consequently,
if
there
is
a
rational
relationship
between
that
and
the
legitimate
state
interest
that
the
state
has
in
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
the
fetus,
that
that
should
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
rational
relationship
test
under
the
(inaudible)
standard.
thank
you.
