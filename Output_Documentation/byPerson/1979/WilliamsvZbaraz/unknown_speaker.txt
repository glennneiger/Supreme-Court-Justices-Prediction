unknown
speaker
you
mean
--
unknown
speaker
no,
they
can
--
they
can
do
it
and
pay
it
for
themselves.
unknown
speaker
congress
--
congress
couldn't
take
that
power
away
from
a
state,
could
it
constitutionally?
unknown
speaker
just
to
be
perfectly
clear,
illinois
is
perfectly
free
to
fund
to
abortions
if
it
wants
to,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they're
going
to
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
in
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
in
the
hyde
amendment
prohibits
that?
all
it
does
is
the
government
won't
put
any
money
on
them,
isn't
that
all
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
all
that
would
any
requirement
of
the
state
doing
--
but
it
didn't
say
the
state
wasn't
perfectly
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
the
hyde
amendment
itself
is
merely
a
refusal
to
--
to
have
any
part
of
a
particular
annual
appropriation
of
any
part
of
that
money
be
spent
to
reimburse
the
state
for
--
for
its
funding
of
abortion
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
think
that
substantive
legislation
would
survive
this
during
the
following
year?
there
were
no
such
writer
to
the
appropriation
bill?
unknown
speaker
or
either
one
year
--
unknown
speaker
one
year
piece
of
a
legislation
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
a
little
mr.
,
you
said
counsel
restrained
not
that
as
in
westcott,
extension
could
not
be
directed
by
this
court.
unknown
speaker
it
may
not.
i'm
asking
you,
may
we
do
what
we
did
westcott,
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
if
we'll
find
the
hyde
amendment.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
true
in
a
westcott
situation,
too.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
that
is
do
you
say
constitutionally
you
may
not
do
it?
or
that
--
i
thought
you
said
--
unknown
speaker
were
ought
to
exercise
restraint
and
not
do
it.
unknown
speaker
constitutionally,
we
do
not
have
a
power?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
inappropriate,
but
do
we
have
the
power?
unknown
speaker
(voice

--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
