the
case
is
submitted.
we'll

arguments
next

williams

zbaraz
and
the
two
consolidated
cases.
mr.
wenzel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

how
about
the
--
how
about
the
abortions
relating
to
the
--
that
would
involve
the
health
of
the
mother?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
i
meant,
when
i
talked
about
therapeutic
abortions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
what
i
meant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
to
be
--
be
sure.
i'm
not
sure
what
this
page
about
or
discussion
about
state's
rights,
sir.
prior
to
1973,
the
state
of
illinois
through
its
legislature
could
have
amended
the
law
so
as
to
achieve
the
same
status
for
abortions
as
the
opinion
of
this
court
did,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
could
have
either
paid
for
all
of
them
or
paid
for
none
of
them,
could
they
not,
the
state
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wenzel.
mr.
rosenblum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
–
before
we
leave
this,
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
legislatures
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
make
value
judgments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
–
and
would
you
say
that
includes
the
--
the
right
or
power?
the
power
to
make
value
judgments
that
are
erroneous
judgments
in
the
minds
of
after
receiving
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
authority
of
the
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
supposed
to
correct
the
--
the
wrong,
the
erroneous
value
judgment
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
there's
something
in
the
levitt
case
to
the
effect
such
as
the
money
were
not
otherwise
provided,
levitt
and
his
colleague
could
go
to
the
court
to
claims
and
sue
the
government.
in
other
words
there's
no
suggestion
that
in
the
levitt
case
that
congress
could
be
compelled
to
see
that
they
were
paid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
let
me
pursue
that
if
the
state
having
that
order
asserted
on
them,
that
command
and
the
state
does
what
president
jackson
did
many,
many
years
ago.
what
can
be
done
about
it?
how
does
a
court
force
the
state
legislature
to
appropriate
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
view
the
constitutional
issues
in
the
state
case
and
the
prior
case
as
the
same
or
different
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
bennett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
a
monolith
--
a
monolithic
basic
set
of
reasons
by
all
the
members
of
the
legislature,
who
--
who
voted
this
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
doing
it
for
the
same
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bennett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
congress
express
a
value
judgment
in
the
hyde
amendment,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
illinois
legislature
provide
an
--
comprehensive
program
for
drug
addiction
and
not
provide
a
comprehensive
program
for
alcohol
addiction
or
vise
versa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
arranged.
just
--
just
take
it
as
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
--
most
of
the
time
--
most
of
the
time,
state
legislatures
don't
go
to
any
great
extent
to
telling
us
why.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
could
they
--
could
they
make
the
choice
of
one
and
not
include
the
other?
that's
my
question
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
1973
opinion
say
something
--
have
something
to
say
about
the
interest
of
the
state
in
encouraging
natural
birth
and
normal
term
birth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
again
with
the
hypothetical
about
program
for
care
and
for
--
drug
addicts.
would
you
think
it's
reasonable
from
general
knowledge
available
to
everybody
that
there
is
a
higher
incidence
of
drug
addiction
among
the
youth
and
the
poor
on
this
country,
than
other
categories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
been
widely
stated
by
many
experts.
assume
that
to
be
true
then,
assume
it.
then
does
not
the
denial
of
--
of
drug
addiction
program
that
have
the
same
or
similar
equal
protection
flaws
that
you
argue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
remaining,
mr.
wenzel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
about
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
