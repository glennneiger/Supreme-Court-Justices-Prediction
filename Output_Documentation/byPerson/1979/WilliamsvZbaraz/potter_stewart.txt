justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wenzel,
just
a
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
appropriate
statutory
context
to
this
case.
when
title
xix
was
originally
enacted,
the
criminal
laws
of
many,
if
not
most
states,
made
the
performance
of
an
abortion
a
serious
offense.
and
i
suppose
that
nobody
could
have
argued
back
in
those
days
in
1965
when
title
xix
was
enacted
by
the
congress
that
title
xix
authorized
or
directed
the
states,
let
alone
authorized
them
to
pay
for
therapeutic
abortions.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
came
along
this
decision
--
this
court's
decisions
in
roe
and
doe,
bolton
and
thereafter,
i
suppose
it
was
clear
that
title
xix,
this
is
prior
to
any
hyde
amendment,
authorized
and
directed
the
states
to
cooperatively
finance
such
therapeutic
abortion.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
clearly,
you
do
take
the
position
that
after
the
hyde
amendment,
a
state
is
not
required
to.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
--
which
of
your
position
in
that
intermediate
period?
after
--
after
this
court's
decisions
in
doe
and
before
the
hyde
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
roe
against
wade
and
doe
against
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
is
at
title
xix
itself,
prior
to
the
hyde
amendment
didn't
put
any
requirement
on
the
states
with
respect
to
therapeutic
abortions.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
your
position
is
that
it's
prohibited
from
doing
so
under
the
federal
program.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
your
position
is
that
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
of
federal
law
and
preemptive
federal
law,
that
illinois
would
have
been
quite
free
to
enact
this
legislation
in
the
absence
of
any
hyde
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
irrational
and
my
brother
rehnquist's
sense
of
a
–
if
you
thought
the
other
way,
you
belong
to
an
insane
asylum?
justice
potter
stewart
that
indeed
is
her
complaint.
she's
being
left
alone.
she's
not
being
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
given
any
help.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
original
conception
was
–
it
was
the
tort
and
not
--
not
a
constitutional
invasion
in
the
original
seminal
brandeis
article.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
abortion
takes
business
on
them.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosenblum,
two
--
two
questions
are
you
talking.
and
let
me
ask
them
both,
first
of
all,
are
you
talking
about
the
congress
or
are
you
talking
about
the
illinois
legislature?
and
secondly,
are
talking
about
remedy
or
are
you
talking
about
the
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
and
better
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
make
any
argument
that
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
position,
mr.
bennett,
then
is
that
title
xix,
in
the
absence
of
any
hyde
amendment,
clearly
requires
the
state
to
participate
in
the
funding
of
therapeutic
abortions
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
--
and
that
even
the
after
the
hyde
amendment
which
by
its
terms,
simply
limited
the
appropriation
of
federal
funds,
title
xix
continued
to
impose
such
a
requirement.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
you're
talking
not
about
the
federal
statute
but
about
the
state
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
your
constitutional
argument,
mr.
bennett,
is
exclusively
an
equal
protection
clause
argument,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
any
part
of
your
argument
as
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
logically
to
be
part
of
the
--
your
brother's
argument
in
the
preceding
case
that
a
state
is
under
a
constitutional
duty
to
finance
abortions
quite
a
part
from
whether
or
not,
it
finances
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
basically
an
equal
protection
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
were
granted
to
others
for
similar
things.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
it's
not
your
claim
that
there's
any
duty
on
the
state
to
finance
abortions
or
indeed
to
finance
anything
for
health?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
according
to
you,
it's
unconstitutional
discrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
i
thought
you
agreed
that
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
for
a
state
to
decide
not
to
fund
any
healthcare
of
any
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
death's
involved
there,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
--
is
your
equal
protection
argument
confined
to
the
what
you
submit
as
unconstitutional
discriminatory
classifications
of
--
in
the
--
of
all
other
healthcare
and
of
not
giving
healthcare
to
--
in
the
case
of
abortions
or
is
it
--
do
you
refine
it
as
between
men
and
women
and
between
teenagers
and
adults
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
but
do
you
--
but
you
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
purely
a
discrimination
as
between
all
other
healthcare
and
--
and
healthcare
and
--
and
--
which
will
be
implicated
in
financing
abortions
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
therapeutic
abortions.
justice
potter
stewart
thus,
you
can
find
your
equal
protection
case
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
assuming
the
same
number
of
pregnancies?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
just
arguably,
if
--
if
this
statute
is
upheld,
there
will
be
fewer
pregnancies.
justice
potter
stewart
in
request,
we
don't
know,
but
at
least
arguably
this
might
inhibit
carelessness,
might
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
who
knows?
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
one
of
a
–
at
least
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
that's
precisely
the
constitutional
vice
of
what
illinois
has
done,
when
it
finances
sterilization
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
and
find
–
and
does
finance
alternatives?
