    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether a federal mine inspector is required to obtain a search warrant before conducting a routine safety and health inspection of mine facilities such as stone quarries pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 
    The four courts of appeals that have addressed this question have upheld the constitutionality of the Act. 
    However, the district court in this case concluded that a warrant was required to search appellee's quarry and therefore declared the warrantless inspection provisions of the statute unconstitutional. 
    The Government has taken a direct appeal from that ruling. 
    The facts may be briefly stated. 
    The appellee, Waukesha Lime and Stone Company, operates a limestone quarry and mill facility in Wisconsin. 
    The quarry consists of two open pits that are as deep as 30 feet in some places. 
    Generally, about three times a day workers use explosives to dislodge pieces of rock from the wall of the quarry. 
    The limestone is then taken to a crushing facility where it is crushed and sorted according to size, and the stone is then taken to a building known as the dust house where it is dried, ground, and bagged for direct sale to customers. 
    Waukesha's facility has been subject to regular safety and health inspections by state officials for about 60 years and it has been subject to federal safety and health inspection since 1966 when Congress passed the predecessor of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act. 
    Now, in April, 1978, a federal mine inspector showed up at Waukesha's mine to conduct a routine health and safety inspection. 
    Following the inspection he cited Waukesha for 25 violations of mandatory health and safety standards. 
    A few months later the same inspector showed up to conduct a follow-up inspection to determine whether Waukesha had corrected the most serious of these violations, specifically, whether the airborne concentrations of silica dust in the dust house had been lowered. 
    Inhalation of excessive amounts of silica dust leads to a condition known as silicosis which is a very serious respiratory disease, even more serious than black lung disease. 
    Waukesha's president, appellee Douglas Dewey, refused to allow the inspector to undertake the follow-up inspection without a search warrant. 
    At that point the inspector discontinued the inspection and issued a citation to the company for denial of entry. 
    The citation was followed by a proposed civil penalty of $1,000. 
    In addition, the Secretary thereafter brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, to enjoin appellees from refusing to permit warrantless inspections of their quarry pursuant to the Mine Safety Act. 
    And as I noted a moment ago, the district court denied that injunction and instead held in reliance on this Court's decision in Marshall v. Barlow's that the Act's warrantless inspection provisions violate the Fourth Amendment.

    Mr. Geller, you're doubtless familiar with the Steagald case that this Court decided a couple of weeks ago, where it said that law enforcement officers, even though they possess an arrest warrant, could not go into the house of a third person to seize the person for whom they had the warrant. 
    Now, certainly crime has been a heavily regulated business in the last 50 or 60 years just like mining. 
    If one were to apply Steagald to this type of case, don't you think the district court's opinion probably has something to be said for it?

    Well, Congress has not attempted to pass that sort of a statute. 
    It's passed a statute which we think is quite similar to the statute that this Court upheld in Biswell, and I don't recall that there was anything in the Steagald opinion which cast any doubt on the continuing validity of Biswell, and therefore we continue to rely on Biswell. 
    This is a regulatory search, for purposes of finding whether there are health and safety violations and not for purposes of finding evidence of a crime.

    I think analytically there are really two separate exceptions. 
    Colonnade, I think dealt with a situation in which there had been an extremely long history of pervasive government regulation in an area--

    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    --Well, we're not talking here, first of all, about any criminal enforcement. 
    We're talking about health and safety inspections, for which this Court has said, routine warrantless inspections are frequently necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the statute. 
    That's certainly not the case with criminal law enforcement. 
    And the situations, in fact, in which it is necessary to conduct warrantless searches in order to enforce the criminal laws, the Court has recognized exceptions, such as exigent circumstances, even in traditional criminal law enforcement areas. 
    But we're dealing here with an industry which we submit has been pervasively regulated for many, many years and therefore it's an even stronger situation in many ways than the situation that confronted the Court in Biswell. 
    But even if the Court were to view this case as not involving a long history of regulation but simply a current pervasive regulation, we think the statute can be upheld under the standard that was announced in Biswell, which requires looking into the privacy guarantees of the statute. 
    In other words, is there a real need for a warrant?

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let me try another hypothetical on you. 
    Suppose, passing over the problems of whether building construction is in the area of interstate commerce, for the moment, that on all buildings and I suppose all commercial buildings would clearly be covered, random inspections by federal inspectors during the process of construction until the building was completed. 
    Would you think that's constitutional?
speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="760.442" stopTime="775.327">
    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    There would be nothing unconstitutional on the face of such a scheme. 
    You'd have to inquire into what the urgent federal interest is, and I said, you have to inquire as to the need for warrantless inspections. 
    There's not always a need for warrantless inspections and when there isn't a need then the traditional warrant requirement should certainly apply.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="775.327" stopTime="796.881">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    There is such a statute with respect to constructing bridges, I think, across any navigable stream, that federal inspectors may come on the site and inspect it at any time without a warrant. 
    I suppose it's to see whether the steel and concrete is going to be enough to hold the bridge up, so it won't fall on the boats or drop the people.
speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="796.881" stopTime="821.198">
    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    I think in that sort of a situation there's a minimal expectation of privacy and it's certainly reasonable for those sorts of inspections to take place. 
    I learned of another example of a very recent industry in which there hasn't been a long history of regulation and yet there's pervasive government regulation and no one has challenged the fact that it's constitutional. 
    That's the nuclear power industry, which has not been in existence for a very long period of time. 
    You don't have the long history that you even had in Biswell.

    There's no piece of paper that is labelled a license, but we don't think that that's all that significant.

    Wisconsin had been regulating this quarry since 1922, but other states had gone back even further than that. 
    So we think that the test is whether there's an urgent federal interest, and whether the privacy, whether the statute involved protects the privacy of the individual, and whether there's a need for warrantless searches. 
    That is, we think, what Biswell says and we think this case falls under Biswell.

    But I wouldn't think it could meet the other parts of the Biswell test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    Now, I think it's important, in trying to focus on why there isn't the need for a warrant in this case, to look at what the statutory protections are for mine operators in order to determine what further protection a warrant would provide. 
    Now, I think the best way to demonstrate that a warrant would be of virtually no practical value in the mine safety context, and would add virtually no protection to these minimal privacy interests that we think mine operators have in these open pits, is to contrast mine inspections with the sorts of inspections that were involved in the Camara and See cases, where the Court held that a warrant was required for routine housing inspections, and in Barlow's, which involved health inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. 
    The Court stated in Camara and it repeated in Barlow's that a warrant would serve a valuable purpose in those situations because it would limit the unbridled discretion of the inspector as to when and whom to search. 
    The Court stated, in addition, that a warrant would assure the homeowner or the businessman that the inspection was authorized by statute, and was conducted pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria, and that it would advise the owner of the precise scope and objects of the search. 
    Now, these points make a great deal of sense, especially Camara, but also in the Barlow's situation, Camara--

    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    --I think that the Court found that there was not the factual basis that the Government thought there was for a need for warrantless inspections in the Barlow's situation. 
    But I think we concede freely that Barlow's involved a situation where six million businesses were subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but only about 80,000 businesses were searched every year. 
    Therefore, when an OSHA inspector up at the door, the businessman really had no reason to know whether he properly was there, whether it was in fact an OSHA inspector or what were the standards that we used to pick that particular business, what were the limits of the search power of the officer? 
    I think it's a totally different situation when we're dealing with mine inspectors. 
    Every mine subject to the Mine Safety Act... and that includes virtually every mine in the nation... has to register with the Secretary of Labor, has to be familiar with all of the health and safety standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, gets a copy of every health and safety standard promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. 
    The statute that regulates this industry sets forth a minimum number of inspections that have to take place every single year. 
    It's a minimum of two for surface mines and four for underground mines. 
    It's generally the same inspector who shows up periodically every few months to conduct the inspection. 
    The inspector in this case submitted an affidavit saying that he had been making all of the inspections of stone quarries in Waukesha County over the previous five years. 
    He had been showing up at this limestone quarry repeatedly to make these inspections.

    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    I think that's right, Justice Blackmun. 
    You have the inspector showing up every few months. 
    The mine operator knows why he's there, he knows who he is, knows what the limits of his search power are. 
    The statute itself sets forth the neutral criteria that would allow the search to take place. 
    One has to ask what additional value a warrant would provide in that situation? 
    Now, the point of all this, I think, is that a warrant here, just as in Biswell... and in Biswell, I might add, the Court made the same analysis. 
    The Court pointed out in Biswell that someone who engaged in a licensed business of dealing in firearms is given a copy of all the regulations that are applicable to his business and is told in advance of what the limits of the searching officer's powers are. 
    And the Court said, we don't think that the additional benefits that a warrant would provide in that situation are very meaningful or outweigh the need for frequent, unannounced inspections, which the Court found in the Biswell situation and we assert in this case, Congress found were essential to accomplishing of the statutory purpose. 
    And the point of all this is that a warrant here, just as in Biswell, would tell the mine operator absolutely nothing that he doesn't already know. 
    And because the Act contains legislative standards that would certainly satisfy the administrative probable cause standard of Camara and Barlow's, we think that mine inspectors could procure a warrant prior to these frequent routine inspections virtually for the asking. 
    Moreover, mine inspectors don't have the unbridled discretion under the Act, but are carefully limited by statute as to who, when, and how often they are to search. 
    It's therefore difficult to see how even the minimal privacy interests that a mine operator might have in these pits would be benefited in any meaningful way by requiring resort to the warrant process. 
    A warrant would simply become an empty gesture, we think, under these circumstances. 
    Now, even though a warrantless context serves no useful purpose, I suppose there would be no great lasting harm in insisting on a warrant if the mine safety and health enforcement program would not be adversely affected. 
    But Congress reasonably concluded that a warrant requirement would seriously cut the Act's enforcement objectives because of the "notorious ease"... and that's the phrase taken from the Senate report... the notorious ease with which many mine hazards may be concealed or corrected temporarily if an inspector has given advance warning of an inspection.

    No, we don't want to get around the Fourth Amendment. 
    We don't think it would get around the warrant requirement because in that sort of a situation a warrant would still serve a very valuable purpose when the inspector showed up at the door to make the inspection. 
    It would tell the person in the house that he is who he says he is, he has probable cause to make the search, and it would explain what the limits of the search power are. 
    I think that none of that is applicable to the mine safety situation where the mine operator knows full well why the mine inspector is there and what the limits of the search power are. 
    So we don't think that that sort of a situation would meet the test of Biswell.

    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    I am, but I think that's just one portion of the Biswell test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and we think that for a statute to meet the Biswell test it has to satisfy all of these criteria, not just one. 
    Now, we mentioned one of these particularly egregious examples in which unannounced inspections would have perhaps saved some lives, in our brief. 
    That's the Scotia mine disaster which took the lives of 23 miners and three mine inspectors in 1976. 
    There the evidence showed after the fact that the mine operator had been moving certain brattices which controlled the amount of ventilation in the mine after the inspector had left, but had made it appear through some sort of cosmetic changes that there had been adequate ventilation. 
    And in fact, in this very case... this is a very useful example... what the inspector was going back in to see was whether this quarry had controlled the level of silica dust in the dust house. 
    Now, it seems clear that if advance notice had been given, such as by showing up and being refused entry until he went back and got a warrant, a quarry could well take cosmetic changes such as shutting down the machines for awhile or opening up the windows for awhile to make it seem as if the dust levels were lower than they really are. 
    Of course, mine inspectors could try to solve this problem by getting a warrant before showing up in the first place, but I think that would produce a massive administrative burden. 
    You have 1,900 mine inspectors who have to make, by statute are mandated to make a minimum number of inspections every year. 
    Last year they made more than 120,000 inspections of mine facilities. 
    I see my white light, and I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.

    What about the hypothetical: Congress after identifying building construction as being within the reach of federal legislative power, laying that aside, then decided that they were going to have inspectors who could come on the on-site of any building more than 100 feet high at any time during the course of construction to inspect.

    Mr. Francis R. Croak 
    --Piggyback on the federal, and the federal on the state or the local; that's my argument. 
    I'm afraid there is no litmus test for pervasive regulations. 
    There is no one thing, I think, that I agree that licensing is but a factor. 
    Obviously, this business is not licensed nor has it ever been. 
    The other factors which are important are the statute itself. 
    I think that that's something that you have to look at. 
    The peppered... that was a pervasive... pardon the use of the word... consideration, perhaps, in Colonnade. 
    And if you look at the history of this particular industry, I think you find that there was really no meaningful federal regulation of this quarry until, really, 1978, when the 1977 Act become effective, because the Act of 1966 merely established certain advisory standards. 
    It provided that there was really no citation authority in the inspecting agents; it provided for one inspection a year, and now we've gone to two... I don't regard that change as significant. 
    It also provided that in a very narrow area of cases involving non-coal mines, inspectors could issue what were known as withdrawal orders, which would have the effect of a temporary shutdown. 
    The nature, if you read those orders, it's hard to equate those with a limestone quarry, an open-pit limestone quarry especially. 
    But what I'm trying to say is that the language of the Court in Barlow's talks about a long tradition of close governmental supervision. 
    And I suggest to the Court that there's no way you can look at this particular industry and say there's a long tradition of close governmental supervision. 
    I'd also point out to the Court that I think what the Government is trying to do is to piggyback the long tradition, if you will, of government control of the coal mine by... because what happened in 1977 was that Congress amended the Coal Act, did away with the act that affected us, the act of '66, and incorporated by amendment and by definition everything that was in the various mining industries and brought them all under the same strictures that had controlled the coal industry. 
    And, I don't challenge the wisdom or the right of the Congress to do that. 
    I'm only saying that that doesn't give the Congress the right, however, to do away with the Fourth Amendment expectations of this particular industry. 
    The other concern which I have is the argument, or the suggestion of an argument that solely because of the injury rate, or the dangerousness, if you will, of a particular industry, that this standing alone gives the Congress the right to mandate warrantless entry. 
    Now, I don't think any of us are unsympathetic with the goals of government to cut down injuries, but I think that there is no case that this Court has ever decided which ever said that injury alone is a justification for waiver of the Fourth Amendment. 
    If we go that route and start establishing those criteria, I suggest we'll be plowing new ground, and perhaps, Justice Rehnquist, opening the door for some of the things that you suggested by your questions. 
    There are certainly areas in American life where everyone would agree... the Congress, or us, or everyone... would agree that there is a significant dangerousness to most of us as citizens, whether we be workers involved or citizens exposed to certain hazards.

    Mr. Francis R. Croak 
    I'm not familiar with that but it wouldn't surprise me at all, and it doesn't offend me. 
    I think that government can reserve activities solely to itself. 
    I think that there is one other concern that I have and that is the Government's argument that... and this is kind of an unusual situation, the Government is telling us what's good for us, and what's good for us is not to request a warrant because there are other provisions within the law that will take care of us and we are saying we don't want that, we want the Government to get a warrant. 
    It's kind of a backwards situation, if you will, but if I could discuss it? 
    The Government says that the injunctive procedures are the equivalent of a warrant. 
    There was language in Barlow's talking about administrative warrants or their equivalent. 
    I suggest that an injunctive procedure is not that. 
    If one examines the record in this case the pleadings of the Government really allege that we didn't let them in. 
    And so who did it shift the burden to, then? 
    The record is clear, the Solicitor General has advised the Court, that administrative action was commenced against us for not letting them in, and we were fined $1,000. 
    I don't think that the injunctive procedure provision was probably even necessary, because if in fact the government inspector had a right to enter, I think that there was adequate remedy in the law as it exists now for an injunctive procedure of some sort to let him in, so that by putting it in the statute I don't think that it gave us any rights, any more or less than existed before. 
    But the more important thing is that the hearing that one gets at this time is, whether you let us in or not. 
    And the relief sought here was a permanent injunction against us ever to keep government inspectors out. 
    I don't think anybody would seriously stand here and argue that one could issue a permanent search warrant for the examination of our premises or--

    The question was whether it was or was not a border search.

    Mr. Francis R. Croak 
    --Yes. 
    There's no question about the legality of border searches; that's right. 
    I think that some of your questions have suggested to me something which really isn't, perhaps, directly discussed in the brief and that is the almost, the ability, almost, to have a piecemeal disintegration of the Fourth Amendment in administrative search situations, because Congress declares, as they did in Barlow's and as they do here, their concern, proper concern for the safety of the American worker. 
    I think that the Government's position would say that any time they identify an injury-ridden industry, that they could say that... and then pass some regulations that this is pervasively regulated, is a proper area of congressional concern.

 To pursue one of Justice Marshall's earlier questions on this duration of the tradition, of the pervasiveness, before we had elevators in buildings there wasn't any need to have random inspection of elevators and elevator shafts, and then elevators which made possible high-rise buildings, because without elevators they couldn't have had them. 
 They had to begin somewhere, with random inspections of elevators, did they not?

    The effectiveness of some of it might be questioned. 
    Obviously, the example the Solicitor General gave of the tragedy was a coal mine explosion. 
    I think that government regulation of coal... I don't think my case stands or falls on the regulation of the coal mines. 
    I also point out that if my recollection is correct for several years, 34 years ago, at the end of World War II, the Government ran the coal industry in America.

    Mr. Francis R. Croak 
    --Yes, it does. 
    And a long history of regulation is only one factor, as I said before. 
    Licensing is another thing. 
    Coal mines have to be licensed as opposed to this registration of the kind of mine that we're operating. 
    I don't know whether that's a significant consideration, but I think you weigh all of these things and the problem I get is this piecemeal attacking of the industry concern, and--

speaker="francis_r_croak" startTime="3256.098" stopTime="3314.012">
    Mr. Francis R. Croak 
    --Yes. 
    In Wisconsin there is a warrant procedure. 
    I would be candid, this operator has never insisted it be used, but it exists and our reference is in our brief to the statute, that there is a provision. 
    And the Government alluded to the fact that this mine has been inspected since 1922. 
    I think, in all candor, though, I must say that that inspection... and I think the record bears me out in this, was the kind of inspection that you get under the Wisconsin worker's compensation law, and I think the testimony showed that the same people that were inspecting the department store, were inspecting the factory, were involved in mine inspection, for many, many years because Wisconsin had a comprehensive worker's compensation law that covered anybody that employed more than two people. 
    But there is, as I say, under that law today there exists a statutory provision for obtaining what is called an inspection warrant. 
    Thank you.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3314.012" stopTime="3316.370">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?
speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="3316.370" stopTime="3510.356">
    Mr. Kenneth S. Geller 
    Just one or two things, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'd like to just speak for a moment to what I think is the key question in the case. 
    Certainly it's the key question as posed by Biswell, but it's not something that I think the appellee has addressed. 
    And that is, if in order to satisfy an urgent federal interest Congress determines that warrantless searches are essential, and if the warrant requirement would not provide any meaningful additional protections to the businessman in terms of either limiting discretion of the searching officer or in giving the businessman information as to why the officer is there, why is Congress's decision to set up a provision such as that unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment? 
    What is the benefit of insisting on a warrant procedure under those circumstances, especially if it means that the urgent federal interest can't be accomplished? 
    Now, the appellee has never identified what a warrant would bring him in a case like this. 
    He's mentioned one thing in his brief. 
    He says, if there had been a warrant, the inspector couldn't have done what he did here, which is to show up and walk around our premises for an hour without telling us he was there. 
    But I think that a warrant wouldn't have done anything about that. 
    He could have had a warrant and still walked onto the premises and not identified himself for an hour. 
    By the way, I should add that the statute prohibits showing up without identifying yourself to the mine operator, who has a right to walk around with you. 
    So the statute provides that protection. 
    In fact, the Stoudt's Ferry case, which is a case that was decided by the 3rd Circuit under the statute, shows that a warrant was really not a meaningful protection, but the injunction procedure under the statute may well be. 
    The mine operator in Stoudt's Ferry refused to let the inspector in claiming that he had some trade secrets he wanted to protect. 
    When the Secretary sued for an injunction the district court molded the injunction to take account of these trade secrets. 
    But if the inspector had simply gotten the warrant, if this Court would have decided that one is necessary, and showed up, it wouldn't have taken account of any of these trade secrets. 
    By the way, Justice Stevens, I think that the statute does prohibit forcible entries for the same reason I think the statute in Colonnade did, because there's no specific provision in there that allows it, and the Court interpreted the statute involved in Colonnade as not allowing forcible entries unless Congress specifically says so. 
    Here Congress has provided alternative remedies when an inspector is refused entry. 
    One is the civil penalty and another is the injunction proceedings. 
    And just finally, Justice Stewart, about the licensing requirement, I think the situation is really no different than it was under the Gun Control Act, even though there was a license there. 
    When the Gun Control Act was passed people who were in that business had to comply with the provisions of that statute or go out of business. 
    The same way here: the Secretary or whatever can shut down mines that refuse to comply with the provisions of the Mine Safety Act, including this provision that they comply with health and safety standards and allow for inspections. 
    People who don't want to continue under those circumstances are free to go out of business but I don't know that it makes that much difference whether there's a physical piece of paper labeled a license. 
    Congress could easily, if that, if this Court finds that that's what the defect in the statute is, put in a licensing requirement. 
    That wouldn't change any of the other provisions of the statute. 
    Thank you.
