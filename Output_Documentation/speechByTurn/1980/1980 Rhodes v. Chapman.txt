    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit for that court's affirmance of a decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio holding that double-celling at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility is unconstitutional. 
    The single issue before this Court is whether the double-celling of prison inmates constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    That's true. 
    The District Court said that it was not holding double-celling per se was unconstitutional, but at three or four different places in that opinion it held that double-celling was unconstitutional. 
    In the record in the case the judge states another three or four times that the question before the court is a question of double-celling.

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    Well, he found a few other unrelated things not to be to his liking. 
    He found nothing in the area of necessary services to be deficient. 
    He only found that double-celling was unconstitutional.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="160.967" stopTime="171.712">
    Justice Blackmun 
    Mr. Adler, would you say that there are some inconsistencies in the district judge's discernment here?
speaker="allen_p_adler" startTime="171.712" stopTime="277.887">
    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    I definitely would. 
    As I was saying, the single issue before this Court is whether the double-celling of prison inmates constitutes cruel and unusual punishment where the inmates were provided with reasonably adequate food, clothing, shelter, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety. 
    The District Court found SOCF to be a top flight, first class institution, built in the early 1970s. 
    It found the institution to be quiet, light, and airy, the food and food service facilities to be completely adequate. 
    It found the institution to be comfortable, not to be hot or stuffy. 
    It found no excessive noise, and few odors. 
    The visitation facilities were more than adequate. 
    There had been no increase in the level of violence in the institution, the inmate to guard ratio was better than that recommended by various experts, the lighting was adequate, the plumbing was adequate. 
    1,150 inmates were working, 426 inmates were attending school. 
    School facilities were light, airy, and well equipped. 
    There was a modern library containing 25,000 volumes, and the law library was adequate; there was no evidence of indifference to the inmates' medical needs. 
    Medical care was adequate. 
    The question of the adequacy of clothing was not raised, nor was the question of disease or illness. 
    Because the District Court found that prisoners at SOCF were provided with all the services necessary to maintain their lives and health, it cannot now be argued that the institution was unconstitutionally overcrowded. 
    It has been argued that the District Court did not end double-celling and therefore only reduced the inmate population to ameliorate what it saw to be overcrowded conditions.

    General Adler, can I ask you just a question about the facts for a moment, and the relief? 
    The case was decided, I think, in 1978, if I'm not mistaken. 
    And I think the judge ordered you to reduce the population by 25 inmates a month, as I remember the relief. 
    And if my arithmetic is correct, I assume that the order probably brought you down so you don't have any double-celling anymore?

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    That's correct. 
    It's the only adequate maximum security institution the State has. 
    And at the time the case was tried the State of Ohio felt, or the administrators felt, that they had 2,300 maximum security prisoners. 
    By reducing that population that would mean maximum security prisoners in the medium security institutions, which has heightened problems in those institutions.

    "Upon consideration of the record on appeal together with the briefs and oral arguments of counsel the Court concludes that the findings of fact of the District Court are not clearly erroneous on this, that its conclusions of law are permissible from the findings of fact. "

 Mr. Adler, now that we have you interrupted, may I ask something? 
 I notice at A-36 in Judge Hogan's findings of fact, he recites a number of empirical social science studies, as I understand them: the American Correctional Institute, National Sheriffs Association Handbook, Manual on Jail Administration, National Council on Crime and Delinquency, et cetera, and so forth; all of which come up with some conclusions as to the minimum requirement per inmate in the way of cell space. 
 Have you any suggestion? 
 Incidentally, how did that all get in, do you remember? 
 How did that get into the record? 
 Is this something of which Judge Hogan took judicial notice?

    Sixteen hundred. 
    And there are now 2,300? 
    There were 2,300 at the time of trial. 
    Now, we brought on the consulting architect, a gentleman named Robert Barnes, who was employed by the federal system for years. 
    And Mr. Barnes' testimony was that he never designed any institution to hold any specific number of people, and to back up what he said, he pointed out that all the support facilities in the institution, if the population was supposed to be 1,620, all the support facilities were overdesigned. 
    Currently, this institution has two dining rooms. 
    One is all but shut down.

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    Lebanon. 
    And they've just taken over the Boys' Industrial School in Lancaster as a reformatory-type operation. 
    Because the District Court found the prisoners at SOCF were provided with all the services necessary to maintain their lives and health, it cannot not now be argued that the institution was unconstitutionally overcrowded. 
    It has been argued that the District Court did not end double-celling, therefore, only reduced the inmate population to alleviate what it saw to be overcrowded conditions. 
    But the Court never found SOCF to be unconstitutionally overcrowded. 
    It did find double-celling to be unconstitutional. 
    The District Court took no action to remedy other conditions it found objectionable but only ordered the inmate population reduced to what the court perceived as the single-cell capacity of the institution, thereby insuring that each inmate had private sleeping quarters. 
    The institution contained 1,620 cells measuring variously 63 square feet and 68-1/4 square feet. 
    There are more than 20 acres under one roof. 
    At the time of trial SOCF had approximately 2,300 inmates. 
    Although it was claimed that SOCF was overcrowded because of a great number of conditions, including double-celling, the court found deficiencies in only four areas: jobs; a delay in education, the number of social workers and psychologists had not increased along with the population of the institution; and it found some past deficiencies in the area of dental care.

    That's what we're asking. 
    Our position is that there are no parameters on which to decide these cases. 
    A judge can conceivably take any combination of conditions, put them together, say I've applied the totality of conditions test, and find the institutional unconstitutional or find the inmates are being deprived of their rights beneath the minimum.

 General Adler, perhaps this is the same point that Justice Stewart is making, but on the one hand, I suppose, Bell v. Wolfish establishes that double-celling is not always unconstitutional.

speaker="allen_p_adler" startTime="1353.892" stopTime="1513.859">
    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    Absolutely. 
    Going to jail is an inconvenience and it's a discomfort. 
    Now, I think you have to have something more for cruel and unusual punishment. 
    And if my reading of Bell v. Wolfish is correct, and you certainly know if it is or it isn't, I read Bell to say that privation and hardship carried out over an extended period of time may be cruel and unusual punishment. 
    But here we don't have the privation and hardship. 
    So my question then is, does the extended period of time make a difference? 
    Since we're only talking about an inconvenience and discomfort. 
    Now, the District Court did not find double-celling to be per se unconstitutional but found it to be unconstitutional when it was combined with factors that naturally flowed from the practice of double-celling or from the fact of imprisonment. 
    The court found that the inmates were long-term. 
    Well, they were prison inmates, and they were convicted of felonies. 
    The court found that the population was greater than the number of cells in the institution. 
    Obvious. 
    It also found that the average floor space available to each inmate in each cell was half, and it found the practice of double-celling to have been of long-term duration. 
    The Court's fifth finding, that most double-celled inmates spend most of their time in their cells directly contradicts the evidence in the case, and the Court's previous finding that 75 percent of the inmates can be out of their cells from 6:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night. 
    That's 15 hours each and every day. 
    So, in fact, most double-celled inmates were out of their cells most of the day. 
    Now, the question of double-celling inmates... the question here simply boils down to, does a prison inmate have a right to private sleeping quarters? 
    And it's our position that the answer must be no. 
    Two or more people sharing a room is commonly practiced in our homes, on college campuses, in our hospitals, nursing homes, and in the military. 
    The question of double-celling prison inmates has been dealt with by four other federal appellate courts. 
    It has been found to be constitutional in each case. 
    Those courts have held that double-celling is not per se unconstitutional, and only rises to a constitutional question where it contributes to the overcrowding of the institution. 
    At least two of these courts have defined overcrowding as a condition where those things necessary to the maintaining of health and safety of the inmates are denied. 
    Those things are adequate medical care, food, shelter, clothing, sanitation, and personal safety. 
    And the courts below found no denials in those areas.

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    Well, I found these particular findings by Judge Hogan to particularly strange because in December, 1976, he ruled that prison inmates have no right to education, social services, or jobs. 
    And then he tells us that we're not giving them immediate educations and therefore we're wrong. 
    And I would assume that if you gave them no education at all, you'd be running a constitutional institution. 
    And as far as the wait for education goes, I don't think anyone gets an immediate education. 
    I mean, schools start in September and end in June. 
    If there aren't any further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    I think, reading the 6th Circuit decision, they might well have. 
    It's a time and totality of conditions test, is a very factual and intensive test, and to the facts found here which are not seriously in dispute about the length of time in cell, the length of time of confinement, the physical and mental injury caused by the confinement, the correct standard is clearly erroneous as applied. 
    Now, as to whether the totality of those conditions reach an Eight Amendment standard, that's a mixed question of law and fact. 
    It's the kind of question which I think district courts are particularly an appropriate forum to be deciding.

    I think the four cases referred to by my opponent here show that courts looking at different prisons with somewhat similar conditions have come out with different results. 
    That's correct. 
    They've looked at the totality of conditions, they've determined whether that totality in fact caused genuine privation and hardship, violate contemporary standards of decency.

    Well, Mrs. Kamp, if the trier, the original trier is looking at the totality or one specific conduct like, let us say, the hanging by the thumbs.

    But that's not what the judge here did. 
    He looked at all of the conditions together and found that double-celling as practiced in this particular institution did violate the Eight Amendment, and therefore he didn't need to reach that.

    Your Honor, I think it's extremely appropriate to rely on such standards. 
    The medical profession in the AMA brief, which has been filed amicus here, shows the reasons for these standards have been developed, not as utopian ideals by any stretch of the imagination. 
    They've been developed because the medical profession has found that you need a certain amount of space in order to preserve mental and physical health.

    Okay, if I could perhaps get back to the factors which he found did lead to it. 
    These were people who were serving sentences of four to 25 years or life, two-thirds of them. 
    This had been going on for two years; it was expected to go on indefinitely. 
    There was no indication that the State had any intention of stopping at double-celling or triple-celling, for that matter, and as was just said, Ohio had no limit it had set for itself on the amount of space per person. 
    Inmates were in these cells for most of the day with their cellmates. 
    This was a specific finding of fact by the trial court, who held that the evidence in the case shows that inmates will be in their cells for most of the day with their cellmates.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    Yes, that's certainly true. 
    There were approximately 300 people who were never double-celled and who had never been at issue in this case at all. 
    And you're right, there were some who were out and who were in school and job programs who might perhaps... he did, however, find that 80 percent of the population could be expected to suffer from some sort of mental or emotional disorder and that those conditions would be aggravated by double-celling in the sense of increasing aggressive behavior, increasing tension, increasing violence in a fixed space, even though not geometric. 
    He also found that approximately 15 percent of the population was schizophrenic and that for these people it was extremely cruel. 
    The evidence indicated that for schizophrenics to be in situations like this in a 14-hour-day lockup causes withdrawal to the point of sometimes even suicide. 
    So he was looking at all of the conditions. 
    There was no classification in this institution. 
    The schizophrenics were not housed separately from the other inmates, nor were they given more time out of their cell, or given single cells, for that matter.

    It says about 75 percent of the inmates who are in double cells have a choice of spending a considerable amount of their time outside of their cells.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I think they are consistent. 
    I think the first set of findings refer to the fact that on paper the dayrooms were open between 9 in the morning and 9:30 at night and that inmates did leave their cells prior to 9 for breakfast. 
    He later finds that because of the maximum security nature of the prison, the fact that there's, you know, essentially no freedom of movement within the institution, the cell doors are only opened once every hour for movement back and forth; that as a matter of fact, inmates were required to spend 14 hours a day in their cells with their cellmates. 
    And I think the trial judge recognized three or four different times in the decision the importance of the factor of time in cell, and his conclusion is that the evidence shows that most inmates are in, or, all inmates, are in their cells most of the time with their cellmates.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    Yes, You're right. 
    The general population were the three-quarters that had some freedom of movement. 
    The other quarter were the people who were in protective custody or were in what was called voluntary idle. 
    As we heard, there were not enough jobs available in the institution. 
    I think the distinction between this kind of prison system and a per se rule which Judge Hogan rejected can be seen in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which has been set forth in the memorandum filed by the United States Justice Department. 
    There they also double-cell, but they only do it with five percent of the population. 
    Of the people who were in this--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2623.722" stopTime="2631.375">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Of those five percent, of course, the impact is the same as if it were the 95 percent, is it not?

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    --No, Your Honor, because there's a different totality of conditions. 
    Five percent in an uncrowded institution where services are available for a shorter period of time because you don't have all of the cells double-celled, is a completely different situation from the institution where double-celling is increasing all the time, where most people are in their cells most of the time, where there are minimal social-psychological and that kind of services. 
    Five percent overcrowding is something that can be dealt with totally differently than a 40 percent overcrowding as here, or potentially, of course, much worse.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    --I'm saying, if you're referring to Lucasville, it's much more than sleeping. 
    It's, as the trial court found, about 14 hours a day, but of course he'd be in his cell with his cellmate. 
    So this is not like Bell v. Wolfish where you were talking about seven or eight hours a day, or the Federal Bureau of Prisons where for most of them they were talking about anywhere from five to eight or nine hours a day.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    Well, Your Honor, I think all of that goes to the fact that this is a maximum security prison, where there is so little freedom of movement, wherever you go there's a threat of violence of the kind of assault, homosexual behavior, rape, that he did refer to as increasing. 
    But this is not like the MCC in New York where people could just wander in and out of their cells back and forth to a dayroom. 
    I think that's how you make it consistent. 
    This, as has been pointed out, is one of many, many cases where conditions in a prison have been challenged. 
    And this Court in Hutto v. Finney impliedly approved the test used by the district court there of totality of circumstances. 
    That is the test which has been asserted by essentially every court, every lower court, that's dealt with the matter since then. 
    And that it's a workable test. 
    But this Court should not say that 65 square feet is always okay, or that it's never okay, or that 40 square feet is always or never, or any square footage. 
    But this is the kind of question that has to be viewed by the District Court taking into account that the Eighth Amendment prohibits unnecessary infliction of pain and violation of contemporary standards of decency; that those are standards which can be reviewed; that the District Court here made explicit findings as to unnecessary injury, the violation of contemporary standards of decency, and that therefore should be affirmed, because those findings are supported by the record.

    Mr. Jean P. Kamp 
    I think they're extremely relevant to contemporary standards of decency. 
    They show the range in which the medical profession, the public health professions, and the correctional experts have seen as necessary to run a constitutional... or adequate prison. 
    Now, that's not clearly the same as saying they defined the constitutional limits.

    We would submit that that's the same test we're talking about here, that the totality of conditions requires that you look at all of the particular conditions within an institution and determine whether it violates the Eight Amendment, and that the place to make that decision is in the district courts.

 Your understanding of the court of Appeals, then, was quite different from yours, because the Court of Appeals begins its short per curiam opinion with a statement that the trial court did find certain conditions at a state prison that violate the Eight Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 
 That's the way the Court of Appeals opinion begins, at this first sentence.

    That is what the Court of Appeals stated, but again, nowhere in Judge Hogan's opinion does he find anything that shocks his conscience or that he considers barbarous treatment. 
    Nowhere.

    The Court of Appeals order... or per curiam, however it's characterized... doubles back on itself about fifteen lines later, and that is at least a partial contradiction of its earlier hints about the Eight Amendment.

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    That's true; very true. 
    Now... Mrs. Kamp has referred to physical and mental injuries as a result of a double-celling. 
    Now, four psychologists and a physician testified during the course of this trial. 
    None of those five men knew of any relationship between double-celling, crowding, and any increase in violence. 
    Also, I'd like to address the AMA standards, since there's never been an epidemic at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, and if some mental damage was done these prisoners, that damage did not manifest itself in any way. 
    There was no increase in behavioral problems, there was no increase in violence, and there has never been a riot in that institution. 
    Now, as to space standards, one of the organizations cited is the American Correctional Association. 
    Now, also appearing as a witness in this case was a Mr. Seigler--

    Mr. Allen P. Adler 
    I've talked to prison administrators in other states and they feel the same way you do, although I can't say that of ours. 
    Now, Mr. Seigler when he was asked if he knew of the American Correctional Association standards, he said, no, that he didn't. 
    Also testifying in this case was Mr. Norman Carlson, who is the current Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 
    At the time he testified he was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association, and he testified that he didn't know what the American Correctional Association standards were, and when asked about another set of standards on which his name appeared, he stated that he did not help formulate those standards and that he disagreed with them. 
    Now, I would also like to point out that Judge Hogan never found 15 percent of the inmates at SOCF to be schizophrenic. 
    He did find that a doctor named Lindner had testified to that fact. 
    He issued no finding at all in that area. 
    As for the time out of cells, the plaintiffs in the court below put on an inmate named Anders. 
    And on 159 of the transcript of this case he testified that he was permitted out of his cell from 6:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night, which completely matches the schedules that were also put in the evidence as Plaintiff's Exhibit 8 in the court below, also demonstrating that the dayrooms are open from 9 o'clock in the morning to 9:30 in the evening. 
    Thank you very much.
