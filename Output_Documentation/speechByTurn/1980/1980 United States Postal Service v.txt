    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations. 
    Mr. Kneedler, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
    That court held unconstitutional as applied to appellees an act of Congress governing the deposit of materials into letter boxes used by the Postal Service for the delivery of United States mail. 
    The statutory provision involved is Section 1725 of Title 18, United States Code. 
    That section prohibits the knowing and willful deposit of any mailable matter on which postage has not been paid into a letter box that has been established by the Postal Service or has been accepted or approved by the Postal Service for the receipt or delivery of mail along any mail route.

    --At the customer's expense. 
    There are circumstances, I am informed by the Postal Service, in which the Postal Service itself will construct letter boxes. 
    This is a program of relatively recent origin. 
    It occurs particularly in new subdivisions where the builder has perhaps neglected to put in what are called cluster boxes, which are groups of boxes at the end of the block to serve all the houses up the block.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Well, the non lockable bins and troughs are really a very narrow category of situations. 
    It occurs in apartment buildings where there is frequently a line of boxes, one for each individual apartment, where letters are received. 
    But if the carrier brings larger parcels that won't fit into the box, then they are frequently deposited in a trough or occasionally on a table to be picked up by the customer, much as a letter carrier might leave a package on someone's stoop if it was otherwise protected, or... Even though it won't fit in the mailbox, it can still be delivered. 
    So that is not regarded as a receptacle or a letter box.

    Well, the reports on the statute when it was enacted in 1934... that's when it was adopted... specify several reasons. 
    One was the protection of the mail revenue. 
    What was happening in the 1930s is that a number of business concerns were delivering their own bills or circulars, that type of thing, which they were authorized to do under the private express statutes. 
    Those statutes permit a person to carry his own mail to a home, and what happened is these companies were having their circulars and bills delivered to premises outside of the mails, but they were using the letter box that had been established or erected on mail routes for the receipt of the U.S. mail, and Congress determined that this practice of delivering things outside of the mail, yet using the mailbox, was depriving the Postal Service of revenue.

    --No, we don't. 
    And there's another factor I would like to mention, though, and that is that, as I mentioned, the domestic mail manual requires the customer to furnish a letter box as a condition to receiving the mail, and as a result of that acceptance of the letter box by the Postal Service, that letter box in effect becomes part of the postal delivery system. 
    For example, as a result of that acceptance both the sender and recipient of mail benefit from federal criminal statutes which bar a person from destroying a letter box that is on the outside of the house or by the curb and also from tampering with the mail that is inside such a letter box.

    As I mentioned, the statute was enacted in 1934, but the Postmaster General had adopted regulations going back as far as 1907 to prohibit the deposit of mailable matter in postal boxes without the payment of postage. 
    One of the purposes that I mentioned of the statute has been to raise revenue but there are others. 
    Another purpose noted by Congress in 1934 when it enacted the statute was to prevent the accumulation of clutter in mailboxes.

    The Postmaster General stated that the Post Office Department... this statement, incidentally, is in the appendix to our brief. 
    The Postmaster General stated that the Post Office Department had been deluged with complaints by citizens that their private mailboxes were being filled with political advertisements, other advertisements, circulars, bills, and the Postmaster General noted that this clutter particularly in urban areas had caused some delay for the letter carriers, and because of difficulties of placing the mail--

    --No, I'm talking about the delay in the letter carrier's making his rounds. 
    There was testimony at trial in this case that if a letter carrier had to come up to a box and it's filled with circulars and other items that have been deposited by others, the letter carrier could not simply deposit the incoming mail into the mailbox. 
    He would have to withdraw the other materials, sort through them, and see if perhaps some of them had been left by the postal customer to be taken away, and also sort through them to see whether there might be violations of the private express statute.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, Volume III of the record in this Court contains dozens of copies of letters sent out by the Postal Service just in the Northeast Region to people who had deposited materials in postal boxes without the payment of postage on them, and what the Postal Service will typically do rather than prosecuting someone is to demand the payment of postage on these materials. 
    There was testimony in the record that in the overwhelming number of cases the person who had deposited the materials will comply and pay the postage. 
    So that the record does establish a pattern of enforcement. 
    That's not to say that there are not some occasions in which the statute is perhaps violated, but there's nothing in the record to suggest that it is being ignored in a wholesale fashion.

    Right. 
    And those circulars under the statute, if they're to be deposited in the letter box, are to have the proper postage attached to them. 
    Also, the fact that there are no criminal prosecutions does not reflect a lack of enforcement effort by the Postal Service under this statute.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No, it's more than a few hundred. 
    As I recall, there's a discussion of a thousand or several thousand in just one postal inspection area. 
    The difficulty with statistics, though, is that the responsibility for enforcing the prohibition at the first level rests with the postmaster of each post office, and it's frequently done on an informal basis, even a telephone call to the person who deposited the material, and then that person may pay in several dollars, or if it's just several pieces, it may be less than a dollar. 
    So that to my knowledge there was no collection of this information from all post offices around the country. 
    What evidence there was in the record concerned situations where the postmaster, individual postmaster had been unable to collect by this method and it was referred to the Postal Inspection Service for additional efforts to collect.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No, it would not. 
    And in fact the alternative of furnishing a separate receptacle for the receipt of items other than the mail was one of the alternatives that was mentioned during the debates in 1932 on a predecessor bill to the one, the statute eventually enacted in 1934 that all the Congress has done is limit the use of the mailbox, which after all exists because of the Postal Service. 
    Congress has not sought in this statute in any way to regulate any other means of delivery by a person to another home or to a business.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Right. 
    It is a crime. 
    It is a crime to steal that. 
    Now, the appellees challenge this statute under the First Amendment, but... and the district court held the statute unconstitutional as applied to appellees. 
    What the district court did was balance what it perceived to be the Postal Service's need to enforce this statute against these particular civic associations, against what it perceived to be the limitations on their First Amendment rights if the appellees were forced to comply with the statute. 
    In our view this ad hoc balancing approach fails to give sufficient deference to Congress's judgment regarding the need for the statute in the generality of cases and it would also make vulnerable many statutes or regulations of general applicability adopted by the Postal Service or by Congress to regulate a mail delivery system of nationwide scope. 
    The district court apparently believed that it was required to balance the need for the statute against the asserted infringement--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Yes, and there was a trial. 
    So this case, this appeal is directly from the district court. 
    Now, the district court apparently believed that some balancing was appropriate here because the statute infringed on appellees' First Amendment rights. 
    This assertive infringement could have two aspects. 
    One, that the statute somehow inhibits other alternative means other than deposit of something in the mailbox, for communicating. 
    Or it could be a contention that charging postage for the use of the mailbox itself violates the First Amendment. 
    The district court seems to have believed that because there was testimony for appellees that these other methods of delivery were unsatisfactory, that the statute somehow inhibited or infringed on the appellees' right to deliver materials.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --He still has to do it but the basis of that argument was that this would increase the cost of the mail delivery system. 
    But to the extent someone puts postage on the letter, then the Government is being reimbursed for that extra effort. 
    I did want to make one point, though, regarding the asserted infringement on First Amendment rights. 
    And that is that the other alternatives that are available to appellees, such as placing circulars on doorknobs, or behind a screen door, or knocking on the door and handing a circular directly to the customer or to the resident, these other alternatives exist whether or not the resident erects a mailbox. 
    And therefore the erection of the mailbox and the Postal Service's approval or acceptance of that mailbox for delivery of mail has absolutely no effect on all the other alternatives that are open to an individual for the delivery of messages. 
    So the erection of a mailbox cannot be said in any respect to infringe upon the appellees' First Amendment rights. 
    So the claim would have to be reduced to the assertion that appellees have a right of access to the mailbox itself irrespective of how available other alternatives may be to them. 
    It's a claim that they have a right of access to the mailbox itself, and this Court has never held that Congress cannot establish reasonable postage fees for the use of facilities related to the mail. 
    The Postal Service has existed as long as the First Amendment in this country and has charged postage for the use of the mails, and it is too late in the day in our view to suggest that significant First Amendment questions are raised when Congress establishes a rate classification system for the use of postal facilities that is nondiscriminatory, as this one is, and is reasonable. 
    I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

    We believe that there are significant First Amendment issues presented by this case:

    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --We don't believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that the rights that we seek to assert permit us to invade anybody's sacred rights of privacy. 
    I believe that the decision of this Court in Rowan indicates that the homeowner may make that decision. 
    There are local law devices such as no trespassing signs and things of that nature whereby the homeowner can preclude any type of distribution.

    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --Yes, it is. 
    It is, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    It's the same chapter. 
    And our argument is that if there is no need to require the payment of postage for a noncompensated individual, how can he possibly under 1725 have the intent to avoid the payment of postage if no postage is required? 
    I believe that the record is clear that the civic individuals in this case, and all those such as the amici and the representative civic groups throughout the United States, and we believe that we are representative of them, are volunteers acting without compensation. 
    So I submit that 1725--

    I believe that is in the Appendix. 
    I'm not certain, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that I can cite you to the direct page, but I believe that the testimony of numerous civic experts indicated that none of these individuals were ever paid, and that is the normal procedure for civic associations in terms of their modus operandi.

    And in addition, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on the prior court of appeals proceeding, which was remanded back, Mr. Justice Stevens, as you point out, there were affidavits submitted in that case from civic representatives in New Hampshire and in Colorado who testified, this is the common procedure, the way it is pursued throughout the United States. 
    So I believe, even though we have not obtained testimony from civic representatives from 50 states, we have obtained testimony from representative groups of civic associations.

    Mr. Justice, in the town of Greenburgh, which is within, the Sawmill Valley is included within, there are upper income areas, there are middle income areas, and there are lower income areas. 
    Indeed, in my own civic association, there is a public housing project of people who are required to be of low income.

    Well, the reason I ask, I notice at page 38 of the transcript, there's his testimony. 
    "Now, Mr. Clark, can you tell us in terms of these hand distributions, who makes them? " 
    "The people who make them, can you tell us? " 
    The answer: 
    "The people who are active in the affairs of the civic association, of which I am only one representative, go from door to door and insert these civic community notices in the private mailboxes of the homeowners. "

 Well, the reason I ask, I notice at page 38 of the transcript, there's his testimony. 
 "Now, Mr. Clark, can you tell us in terms of these hand distributions, who makes them? " 
 "The people who make them, can you tell us? " 
 The answer: 
 "The people who are active in the affairs of the civic association, of which I am only one representative, go from door to door and insert these civic community notices in the private mailboxes of the homeowners. " 
 Next question: 
 "To your knowledge, are any of these people ever paid? " 
 Answer: 
 "No adult, to my knowledge, has ever asked for or received any compensation for this activity, but youngsters in the community, by their parents, and sometimes possibly from the civic association, would be given 50 cents or a dollar or so, a little family stipend, for going down one side of the street while the parent is working the other side of the street. " 
 Is that the testimony you're talking about?

    Well, this statute is somewhat ambiguous. 
    I think 1725 is somewhat ambiguous. 
    I think the questions with respect to slots created ambiguity, both at the course of trial where one government witness testified it was covered by the statute and one testified it was not. 
    The Post Office issued post trial regulations deleting the problem of the slot.

    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I would state this.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2383.090" stopTime="2395.614">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Probably? 
    Well, if you rely on the Wall Street Journal on the revenues of Federal Express and United Parcel Service, there can't be any question about it, can there?
speaker="jon_h_hammer" startTime="2395.614" stopTime="2413.726">
    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --No, I think you're correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I would state this, that we are dealing here not with commercial distributions but with the core First Amendment distributions of political, civic, and community minded information. 
    The type of information upon which--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2413.726" stopTime="2430.004">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But your posture would be the same, I should think, on the First Amendment, if you wanted to be sure to get delivery and couldn't depend on the mail, the Postal Service, that you engaged United Parcel Service or Federal Express to make your deliveries for you.
speaker="jon_h_hammer" startTime="2430.004" stopTime="2435.006">
    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --In terms of reliability of delivery, yes. 
    That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but what... I think--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2435.006" stopTime="2439.827">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    And that's taking business away from the Postal Service and using one of their facilities, is it not?
speaker="jon_h_hammer" startTime="2439.827" stopTime="2577.582">
    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --That's correct. 
    And I would have two answers to that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    One is a statutory construction point. 
    I think that the provisions of this statute which refer to circulars, statements of account, and sale bills, and the legislative history confirms this, indicate that this statute was intended in 1934 to cover only commercial material, not noncommercial material. 
    I think the plain language of the statute indicates that. 
    And this Court could determine this issue without regard to the questions of commercial distributions. 
    That's one answer, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The second answer is that I think that this Court in the cases last term, the Consolidated Edison case and the Central Hudson case, indicate that even though commercial distributions do have a First Amendment right and I believe that the trend of the decisions in this Court confirms that, there is still a greater degree of protection necessarily afforded to noncommercial distributions: the political, civic, and public interest material which we seek to distribute, which the amici seek to distribute, and which all the representative civic groups throughout the United States seek to distribute. 
    I believe that the compelling government interest, if any, which the Post Office seeks to assert here, is not well taken. 
    They assert a loss of revenue, and I think there are several answers to that. 
    If a person can deposit, or distribute as a volunteer under 1696, regardless of how ambiguous that statute may be, then there cannot be any concern for loss of revenue. 
    In the second case, and in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that there has been wholesale violation of this statute for many years. 
    We don't claim any invidious discriminatory nonenforcement, but the trial judge took judicial notice of the fact that this statute appears to be more honored in the breach than in the enforcement since its enactment in 1934. 
    And if that be the case, then I think there is very little possibility of any revenue or adverse revenue--

    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    --Well, that gets into the gist of generis concept, which I think leads to the same conclusion, Mr. Justice Brennan, that it should be commercial only. 
    Indeed, the legislative history which is before this Court indicates that the reason this statute was enacted was because utility companies in the 1930s were using this as a device to distribute their bills. 
    I don't believe that there is any record of any civic violations, and I believe that there is an exhibit in the Appendix which shows that there has never been any record of a civic association violation of this statute until the enforcement threats which precipitated this litigation.

    --No, it does not, but but I believe that in construing a statute under the First Amendment, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we have to look... and we don't maintain that the statute is facially invalid... the statute, the Government argues, is content neutral. 
    And that is a label that they seek to attribute to it. 
    But I submit that the statute should be construed in terms of its practical application, the practical realities of how it is applied. 
    The particular environment to which I believe this Court referred in Tinker v. Des Moines School District, that I think is the threshold question which this Court has to answer.

    No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, not that one. 
    I would like to respond to the Chief Justice's comments before I conclude, about the civic experts. 
    The trial judge specifically made findings of fact with respect to these alternative means of delivery, and he found they were not viable methods of delivery. 
    I believe that under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we should accept these findings of fact by the trial court, and I believe that much of our brief was devoted to that discussion.

    What you're suggesting is that if a statute isn't enforced some kind of a special doctrine of laches runs against the Government.

    Mr. Jon H. Hammer 
    I concede there is no doctrine of laches against the United States of America or even against the United States Postal Service. 
    But I would submit also that we have to look at this case in its cumulative effect. 
    The cumulative effect of this case is to deny distributions under the First Amendment, the core distributions under the First Amendment. 
    The participatory democracy which is essential if the average citizen is to have any say and any responsibility in the operations of his governments, and I submit that if this method is denied, the facts demonstrate that there are no alternatives, that there are no effective alternatives except the alternatives which are available by reason of the dollar, and I submit that is not feasible. 
    I see my time is concluded.

    Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'd like to make several points. 
    One, earlier when I was questioned about the criminal statutes prohibiting the taking of materials out of a letter box, I looked back at 18 United States Code 1702 and 1708, which both refer to the taking of a letter from an authorized receptacle without regard to whether that letter was sent through the mail. 
    So, according to the terms of these statutes, it would appear that even appellees' materials once placed in a letter box would then, if they had placed postage on them, would then be protected by these federal statutes, and so they would in effect--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --It just says, 
    "letter, postal card, or package. " 
    without qualification. 
    But also, with respect to the argument based on the private express statutes, 18 United States Code 1694 and 1696, I think it's important to keep in mind that Section 1725, which was involved here, was enacted against the background of private utility companies who were relying on the private express statutes to carry or transmit their own materials outside of the mail. 
    And yet Congress enacted this statute to prohibit those companies from using a facility of the mail, in this case, the letter box, to effectuate the delivery of the materials they had carried. 
    So, as a matter of statutory construction, there's, I think, simply no room for the argument that letters that are delivered to a home under the private express statutes are somehow exempt from the prohibition of 1725. 
    That would be directly contrary--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Mr. Justice Stewart, that was Footnote 4 on page 31a of our jurisdictional statement, and there the district court did reject those arguments. 
    Now, this was in the district court's first opinion before the case was appealed to the court of appeals. 
    One last point I would like to make is that our argument regarding the validity of the statute does not depend on factual showings in the district court regarding the adequacy of alternatives. 
    In fact, we believe the district court properly dismissed the complaint the first time around. 
    And that is because the effectiveness of the alternative means of delivery that appellees have is totally unaffected by the presence or absence of a mailbox. 
    Congress is not obligated by the First Amendment to provide a postal service or mailboxes and in the absence, if Congress declined to do so, there could be no First Amendment argument that Congress was somehow required to furnish postal boxes for the delivery of mail. 
    And since the mere placement of a postal box on a residence does not change the effectiveness of the available alternatives. 
    I see my time has expired.
