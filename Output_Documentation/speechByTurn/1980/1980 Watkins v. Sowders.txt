    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These cases are here by a reason of the grant of writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    These cases were consolidated for argument and decision in the Court of Appeals as well as in this Court. 
    They present the question whether a state criminal trial court is constitutionally compelled to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly. 
    For the reasons elaborated in the opinion of the Court filed today, we hold that the constitution does not require a per se rule compelling such a procedure in every case and accordingly the judgments of the Court of Appeals are affirmed. 
    Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which he has been joined by Justice Marshall.
