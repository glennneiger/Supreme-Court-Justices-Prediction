    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This -- this case involves the validity of a ruling by the Federal Reserve Board which interprets the Bank Holding Company Act to allow investment advisory services to be performed for closed-end investment companies by nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 
    The ruling was challenged by an association of open-end investment companies and held to be invalid by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
    In an opinion which we filed with the clerk today, we explained at some length the reasons why we think the action of the Federal Reserve Board was consistent with the statutes that are connected with this -- this matter and we therefore reverse the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
    The opinion is unanimous insofar as the members of the Court who participated. 
    There are six members who participated. 
    Justices Stewart, Powell, and Rehnquist did not participate in the decision of the case.
