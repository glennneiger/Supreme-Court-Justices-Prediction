    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The case of Feodor Fedorenko v. United States, which is now before this Court, is an appeal from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in a denaturalization proceeding on grounds that the District Court erred in its interpretation of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and because that court also erred in finding an equitable alternative basis for its holding in that lower court decision. 
    Although three challenges were raised by the Government in its appeal before the 5th Circuit, the 5th Circuit decision was limited to whether or not the court erred in its interpretation and application of the second standard in Chaunt, which comes out of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and whether that court had no basis for an equitable holding, which it did find. 
    Precedent for this case arises out of the 1969 Supreme Court decision of Chaunt v. United States. 
    In that case the Supreme Court was asked to interpret the meaning of the materiality standard as imposed by the statute. 
    The District Court, in following the precedent, and the Supreme Court's determination of what was a materiality question, held that the Government in the lower court failed to prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the petitioner's visa was illegally procured by material misrepresentation under 8 U.S.C. 1451(a). 
    The Court of Appeals disagreed with the lower court as to its meaning of Chaunt, and held that the Government did in fact meet its burden of proof under the second materiality standard set forth in Chaunt. 
    The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court in its finding in holding that the Government had not met its burden in the first materiality standard test. 
    The Court of Appeals also disagreed with the District Court in that there was no precedent for the District Court to hold that it could consider equitable grounds as an alternative holding in its case. 
    The Court of Appeals then reversed and remanded the appeal back to the District Court.

    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    Your Honor, if his citizenship is taken away, he would be subject to further proceedings under the Deportation Section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which would require further proceedings. 
    He just simply loses his citizenship at this juncture, if the Supreme Court so holds that the appellate court was correct. 
    By way of background, the petitioner in this action, Mr. Feodor Fedorenko, was born in 1907 in Sivasch, Ukraine, subject of the USSR, and received a third grade education. 
    In 1941 he was mobilized into the Russian army along with his truck and while serving in the Russian army, his group was overrun by the German forces--

    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    --and taken prisoner by the Germans. 
    Subsequently he was transported to five different camps, which are cited in the brief. 
    And in those camps he was starved, he was beaten, and he was forced to work or die. 
    He was then trained at Travnicki to serve as a guard and was given a uniform, boots, and trained to operate and handle a weapon. 
    That was a rifle. 
    He was then sent to the Treblinka Camp, where he served involuntarily as a guard for 10 months. 
    After the uprising in Treblinka in August, 1943, he was assigned back to Travnicki, then to Poelitz, and then to Hamburg, all while under the control of the German army.

    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    Your Honor, it's only relevant in the sense--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="457.646" stopTime="462.600">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    The question here is whether he concealed relevant information, is it not?
speaker="brian_m_gildea" startTime="462.600" stopTime="801.835">
    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    --That is correct, Your Honor. 
    The reason why I bring this fact out to Your Honors is that in his xx he was transferred not only to Treblinka but also to Poelitz, which was a labor camp. 
    That fact was ultimately revealed to the immigration authorities, although Treblinka was concealed. 
    And that becomes an important issue in this case, as I will get to. 
    When the war ended the petitioner worked for the British forces until 1949 and thereafter applied for immigration into the United States through the vice consular office in Germany, was accepted, and came to the United States in 1949. 
    From that point on he resided in Waterbury, Connecticut, up until the time of his retirement from his place of employment and in 1970 he received his naturalization after his application filed in 1969, and in 1977 the Government commenced these proceedings against Mr. Fedorenko, seeking to strip him of his naturalization, claiming that he had made a material misrepresentation in procuring his visa to the United States, that he had committed atrocities at the Treblinka death camp, and that he had been in service in the German army. 
    After a trial which was conducted in part in Waterbury, Connecticut, and then in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the District Court in a 54-page decision rendered judgment for the petitioner. 
    The District Court rejected the testimony of Treblinka survivors, who testified at that trial regarding Mr. Fedorenko and his activities at the Treblinka death camp. 
    Mr. Fedorenko, in marked contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who testified who came over from Israel, denied all of the allegations and denied all of the testimony against him with the exception of the fact that he was indeed a guard in Death Camp No. 1, but only a perimeter guard and had nothing to do with the actual operation of the gas chambers. 
    The Court also found, in its 54-page decision, that the petitioner served involuntarily as a guard under a threat of death, and that his misrepresentations were not material under either of the tests in Chaunt v. United States. 
    The District Court also found an alternative holding for its decision on equitable grounds. 
    The Government appealed, claiming the District Court erred in rejecting testimony of witnesses, and in applying the materiality standard, and in using equitable considerations as an alternative holding. 
    The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did not rule on the District Court's rejection of the testimony of the Treblinka witnesses. 
    It simply ruled only on the grounds as to whether or not the Government had met its burden of proof as to the second materiality standard and whether the District Court had authority to enter an alternative holding on equitable grounds. 
    It was, indeed, critical to the Government's appeal before the 5th Circuit to convince that court that the testimony of one Kempton Jenkins established the clear, unequivocal and convincing standard required by Chaunt. 
    The testimony of Mr. Jenkins was the only testimony offered by the Government in an attempt to satisfy that standard. 
    The District Court rejected a substantial portion of Mr. Jenkins' testimony because it was circumstantial, inaccurate, and not clear, unequivocal, and convincing to prove a material misrepresentation under either of the Chaunt standards. 
    As in Chaunt, the Government here was given one fact and that was the petitioner's presence at Poelitz, which was a known labor camp. 
    And that fact should have, according to the testimony of Mr. Jenkins, triggered an investigation into Mr. Fedorenko's background. 
    Either it did not or the investigation which was conducted did not disqualify the petitioner. 
    The record is unclear as to what specifically happened with Mr. Fedorenko at the time that he filed his petition for visa to the United States in 1949, because the Government did not produce as an essential witness in this case Mr. Ralph G. Clark, the vice consul who processed his visa.

 I know that the district judge did not accept... he testified as an expert, as I recall, wasn't it? 
 And the... that was not accepted, or made a finding of fact by the district judge. 
 But had it been Jenkins' testimony to that effect, would that not be the end of the case? 
 Wouldn't that satisfy the first Chaunt test?

    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    I believe it would. 
    If I may direct a comment to your question, Justice Brennan, in reference to that It should be noted that Mr. Jenkins' testimony with reference to voluntariness, that is, whether or not Mr. Fedorenko's service was voluntary, was based upon his opinion from hearsay evidence or conversation that he had with other vice consuls, and because of only a very limited contact with three other guards, whether they were personal contacts or contacts with the other consuls, I'm not sure. 
    But he did not at any time ever interview or refuse admittance by way of visa for any guard who served at the Treblinka camp. 
    Furthermore, the District Court rejected his interpretation of voluntary because to accept his opinion of voluntary status would mean that those survivors of Treblinka who have found their way to the United States would have been rejected by his standard, because they in some way served at the Treblinka death camp and processed other Jews and Christians to their death. 
    Now if one accepts the fact that the kapos that were at the Treblinka camp and that the laborers who were forced to perform mechanical tasks in processing these people into the gas chambers, according to Jenkins' standards, committed voluntary acts or acquiesced in the German efforts to annihilate people because of their religion, that is, the Jews; to annihilate people because of their inferior background, that is, the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Eastern Europeans; then they would not be admitted to the United States. 
    Their service would have been considered voluntary and not involuntary. 
    And the District Court felt that involuntary was a very crucial key to this case, and ruled, after listening to the testimony of Mr. Jenkins and after listening to the testimony of all the survivors of Treblinka, and Mr. Fedorenko, that his definition of voluntary should be rejected.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    The concealment.
speaker="brian_m_gildea" startTime="1041.672" stopTime="1321.469">
    Mr. Brian M. Gildea 
    --That's correct. 
    And the issue is whether or not the concealment of his whereabouts during World War II, that is, his presence at the Treblinka concentration camp, was a fact that would have denied him admission under either the first or the second test. 
    Now, the Government claims that the nondisclosed fact, that is, Treblinka or his presence at Treblinka as a guard would have triggered an investigation resulting in the denial of his visa. 
    This case is distinguishable from the Chaunt case in some minor respects. 
    And one of the respects I wish to point out is this. 
    In the Chaunt case the Supreme Court had ruled that the nondisclosed membership of Mr. Chaunt in the Communist Party was a fact in and of itself that should have denied citizenship, whereas this petitioner's nondisclosed guard duty at Treblinka was found by the District Court as nondisqualifying, that that fact in and of itself would not have denied him admission to the United States. 
    In Chaunt the Supreme Court also considered additional facts to see whether the second test had been satisfied. 
    In Chaunt the Supreme Court considered whether the nondisclosure of an arrest record was a material misrepresentation under the second test of Chaunt. 
    It ruled, no, because the ultimate facts, that is, the cause for the basis for arrest, although involving convictions of minor crimes, was of an extremely slight consequence. 
    The District Court also looked into the background of Mr. Fedorenko, the petitioner, in this matter, and in the evidence that was offered by the Government, evidence to establish those ultimate facts... that is, his presence at Treblinka, the voluntariness of his services, and the commission of atrocities, were ultimate facts that the court ruled upon... worked in favor of the petitioner, and the court concluded that the petitioner had not committed atrocities, had not served voluntarily, and that these facts would not have denied him a visa, and therefore no material misrepresentation had been committed. 
    It is interesting to note that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals dropped from its decision the essential term that had been contained in the Supreme Court's decision of Chaunt, and that was the term, "unequivocal". 
    The Supreme Court had held in Chaunt that the Government must prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, that there was a material misrepresentation. 
    The District Court used the full meaning of Chaunt in its application to the facts in this case, whereas the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals slightly modified the meaning of Chaunt, not only by dropping that term from the standard that the Government must establish in its proof, but also modified some of the words in the Chaunt decision. 
    The Court of Appeals in its interpretation of Chaunt said that 
    "the test of Chaunt, including, had the petitioner disclosed his presence at Treblinka, would have conducted an inquiry that might have resulted in a denial of a visa. " 
    The Supreme Court in the last few words of its second standard in Chaunt did not use the term "might", but used the term "would". 
    Thus the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals really disagreed with the District Court by saying, the Government need only prove or establish that there is a possibility of an investigation and that possibility--

    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The burden is two fold, the burden of the petitioner not being able to offer the witnesses that would support his claim of involuntary service. 
    Those were witnesses that were in the Soviet Union, and which the District Court moved were not essential in its decision in this case. 
    And the burden of the Government in establishing witnesses that were present at the time, being able to give evidence to the Court as to the circumstances then and there existing.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Attorney General. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Benjamin R. Civiletti
speaker="benjamin_r_civiletti" startTime="1931.676" stopTime="2213.441">
    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Although the facts in this case stretch back ten years, 35 years, those facts, and the issues presented in the case, have been relevant throughout that time, are important today, and I suggest are important for the future. 
    Over 150,000 people were naturalized in the United States in 1980 and in the decade between 1970 and 1,500,000 people were naturalized. 
    The question as to fraud in procurement of citizenship rights, and the process by which the Government is permitted or allowed to determine that fraud, and the standard under which misrepresentations or concealments are determined to be material are relevant and important to the underlying facts of this case, of course, but to the entire operation of questions dealing with entry, resident alienship status, and denaturalization as well as deportation. 
    It is true, as Justice Murphy speaking for the Court said, today perhaps more than in 1943 when he stated it in Schneiderman, that 
    "Many regard citizenship of the United States as the highest hope for civilized man. " 
    And for that reason we exercise great care in the review, the application, of the law and the standards by which we are to deprive someone of that great privilege. 
    I wish to discuss and address two points in my argument. 
    One, the meaning of materiality as applied in Chaunt and derived from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in Section 1451(a), as applied to either a willful misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, the grounds in this case on denaturalization was ordered by the 5th Circuit. 
    And the second point I wish to address will go to whether or not the Government in the District Court by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence proved even evidence sufficient to meet and satisfactorily meet the first test in Chaunt. 
    With regard to the first point, the issue as I see it before the Court is whether 1451 and materiality applied to it requires the Government to prove that the facts if known, facts which were concealed or misrepresented, if known, warranted denial of citizenship, an ultimate fact or test; or whether the second and alternative test in Chaunt, which I refer to as the investigative or investigation test, allows the Government to prove materiality by showing that if the facts, if known, would have been useful in an investigation which might discover grounds or facts warranting denial of citizenship.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    I think that the Court stated in Chaunt the second investigative test in two separate ways which, I think, have the same meaning. 
    It said, early in the opinion, in the first statement of the test, language to the effect: the facts, if known, which would be useful in an investigation to determine whether or not there were grounds for denial of citizenship. 
    In the second part of the test, the second statement, a restatement, I think it dropped the "useful" language and said: facts which, if known, might possibly lead to... in an investigation... lead to the discovery of facts warranting denial of an investigation. 
    I think both statements assume or presume an investigation, a concealment of facts sufficient that, if known, they would trigger an investigation, and then pose the scope or focus of the investigation to be, in order to be relevant and material, to the eligibility, the possibility, or that might disclose facts, other facts, different from the concealed facts--

    The Government feels that the thrust, purpose, and intent of 1451 is to prevent fraud, to prevent material misrepresentations, to allow the Government to rely on the accuracy and truth of the statements, and that therefore if the concealment thwarts an investigation, that had the facts revealed it, then the Government has a right to denaturalize the person if it further shows that within the focus of the investigation there were facts which might have warranted denial of citizenship or eligibility.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    I do not think that they rejected the test. 
    I think that they applied the test in finding that the concealed facts of arrest in Chaunt were so unrelated to the possible discovery of the membership in the Communist Party that they were too remote and too tenuous, even if there had been an investigation and been discovered, to provide any probability that they would have formed a basis for discovering facts which would have warranted denial of citizenship... particularly in light of the fact that facts closer to the bone, the membership in the communist front organization, were revealed in the papers... and that therefore there was an insufficient proof of the two elements necessary in the second investigative test in Chaunt. 
    One, there was an insufficient proof that there would have been an investigation, since the revelation of the communist front organization participation did not trigger an investigation. 
    And secondly, had there been an investigation, the elements of the facts in the arrest were insufficient to have been within the scope of the focus of the investigation to lead the Government into a discovery of the Communist membership.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    No. 
    I think probably Justice Clark in the dissent was reading the Chaunt test closely or narrowly and quarreling with it by restating and reciting the test that he felt was rejected by the second investigative test stated in Chaunt. 
    But I don't think that in the discussion by Justice Douglas of the connection, the relationship between the investigation... the concealed facts and potential ultimate facts... can suggest at all that what was meant by the second investigative test, that the Government had to in effect prove by clear, unequivocal, convincing evidence other, ultimate facts indicated a denial of citizenship. 
    Because, if that were the case, there's no need for two tests. 
    If the Government must prove that there were existent "facts"--

    Justice Stevens 
    There'd still be a difference because the first test is very simple: if the concealed fact itself would result in denial, that's it. 
    The second test would be, there are somewhere in the background facts not specifically called for by the application but which might have been discovered, and would have warranted a denial, but there's doubt as to whether they would have been discovered. 
    And then the test would be whether the concealed fact would have triggered investigation which might have led to the discovery of a disqualifying circumstance; that's a different test. 
    Now, I know you don't agree with it but at least it's a different test than the first test.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    Certainly many of these cases, both this case and many other cases in the field, are cases brought six, eight, ten, 15, 20 years or more after the operative facts, particularly if the concealment and misrepresentation takes place and is not only perpetuated in the naturalization but takes place at the time of entry or the time of establishing eligibility under Displaced Persons Act or under immigration quotas or other facts. 
    And the Government can't be denied, it seems to me, and the petitioner or the defrauder permitted the opportunity to benefit to the extent he would benefit under the petitioner's point of view for 10 or 20 or 30 years, based on his fraud, and then be in no less position than he would have been in had he not committed fraud, since the Government still has this very onerous burden of proof and proper burden of proof, and the petitioner has enjoyed 10 or 20 years of residence and some of citizenship in the United States, and in the process has shifted the burden of proving eligibility and establishing eligibility to the Government because the Government bears the full burden in a denaturalization case, of course, to prove by the standard of proof that either there are facts which it establishes, which show denial of citizenship, or a material misrepresentation or concealment by facts which, if known, would have triggered an investigation which might have or possibly have shown facts warranting a denial of citizenship. 
    The Government must go further than simply say that there might be facts out there somewhere from which a denial of citizenship could be gathered.

    And that essentially is the argument, that the guard service... armed guard service, in a hat and shirt and jacket with epaulets and with stripes, with a black tie, with boots, with a pistol, and with a rifle... was of... in an extermination or death camp, as opposed to all other varieties of camps... was such conduct that under the Displaced Persons Act definitions, adopting the International Refugee Organization definitions in Appendix 1 of its constitution, that it amounted to assistance of the enemy in the persecution of a civilian population. 
    Jenkins' testimony was uncontradicted and unequivocal and based on over 5,000 applications, the interviews of many survivors, the exchange of information among other like vice consuls... and there were some 30 or 40 of them operating in Europe at the time... that no death guard, no armed death guard would have been granted eligibility under the Displaced Persons Act by a vice consul.

speaker="benjamin_r_civiletti" startTime="3286.174" stopTime="3487.602">
    Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti 
    --Yes. 
    The testimony there cited, the Q &amp; A there cited, related to establishing Jenkins' testimony at the time, establishing that there would have been an investigation and then further question and answer was: 
    "And what if the investigation had shown that he had been a guard at an extermination camp or death camp? " 
    And the answer then was: 
    "Displaced person eligibility or a visa would have been denied. " 
    The lower court found that part of, expressly found that that part of Jenkins' testimony with regard to the finding that if he had been a guard the process would have been stopped and that there would have been an investigation... was credible, gave it full weight, found that fact; which satisfies test 2 of Chaunt as far as the Government's proof of clear and convincing evidence. 
    The District Court went further, though, and found... and this is where I think the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did not alter the finding, it simply found it unnecessary to determine. 
    The District Court found that as a matter of either fact or misapplication of law by Jenkins, that the testimony of Fedorenko was such that the service as an armed guard in an extermination camp was so involuntary on Fedorenko's part that it would not have disqualified him from eligibility as a displaced person. 
    That's what the District Court found. 
    It in fact interpreted or substituted its view of the definition of voluntariness and the definition within, assisting the persecution of civil population, at the trial; and with Fedorenko's testimony to come to the conclusion that the application by Jenkins of the Displaced Persons Act with the fact and the conduct and all the relevant evidence and knowledge that he had as to the nature of the armed guard participation at a death camp, was... his conclusion that that was sufficient alone to deny a visa or eligibility as a displaced person, was incorrect and not credible or not believable. 
    I suggest that that was at least a mixed question of law and facts; that the evidence was uncontroverted on the point, from Jenkins; that the voluntary testimony, or the testimony with regard to involuntariness by Fedorenko, was insufficient to establish or to change what would have happened; and the only evidence as to what would have happened with regard, and properly happened with regard to a denial of a visa in 1949.
