New York v. Belton

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in New York v. Belton. 
    Mr. Harvey, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the legality of a search conducted by a police officer of a jacket belonging to the respondent and the admissibility of the evidence... in this case, cocaine... which was obtained from that jacket. 
    The basic issue boils down essentially to whether or not the search was permissible as a search incident to a lawful arrest which was one of the several well-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. 
    By way, just very briefly, of background of the case and how it got here. 
    The respondent moved to suppress the cocaine at the trial level; that motion was denied after a hearing. 
    The evidence was held admissible; the respondent subsequently pled guilty and appealed the case to the New York State intermediate appellate court, which unanimously held that the search was proper of the jacket in this case, as a search incident to a lawful arrest. 
    The respondent further appealed to the New York Court of Appeals which in a divided opinion reversed the appellate court, lower appellate court, and held that the officer had in effect reduced the jacket to his exclusive control when he, if you will, picked it up, and therefore a warrant was at that time necessary under the law. 
    The facts in this case, if I could very briefly run through them... I think they're very important, and they're pretty much... well, they're not in dispute by either counsel for the respondent or myself, but I'd like to go through, and start out by saying that it was on April ninth 1978, that the Trooper Nicot in this case, a state policeman, was patrolling the New York State Thruway, an interstate highway, and he spotted the respondent's vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed on the highway.

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    Mid-morning, Your Honor. 
    And he pulled over the vehicle. 
    There were four male occupants, two in the back and two in the front. 
    When he went up to the window... it was rolled down by the driver; he went to the driver's side... he smelled fresh burning marijuana and observed on the floor a Supergold stamped container which he knew from his training to be a container that normally contains marijuana. 
    At that point in time he directed all four occupants to leave the vehicle, which was a two-door vehicle. 
    They got out of the vehicle. 
    He at that point in time retrieved the Supergold container, which did contain marijuana, in fact, and some four or five "roaches" or burned marijuana cigarettes in the ashtray of the front portion of the vehicle. 
    At that point in time he again patted down or searched further all of the four occupants of the vehicle, read them their Miranda rights, placed them under arrest for possession of marijuana. 
    At this time we had four defendants outside of the motor vehicle there on the expressway. 
    The officer then went back into the vehicle and on the back seat there were lying five jackets. 
    He picked up the jacket involved in this particular case and he took ahold of it, went through it, and found cocaine in an unzipped pocket as well as a $20 bill and cocaine in a zippered pocket. 
    Not that that makes any difference. 
    And he then asked each of the four defendants, at this point, occupants of that vehicle, as to who owned this particular jacket.

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    That's correct. 
    In the respondent's name. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    Now, it's the position of myself that in this particular case Chimel v. California governs in that this was a proper arrest and a search. 
    There's no question about the lawfulness of the stop, and there's no question of the leadup to the arrest for the possession of marijuana, that this was a lawful stop and a lawful search incident to arrest. 
    Now, Chimel, of course, pointed out you can certainly search the arrestee, in this-case, four arrestees, and that you can also search the area under the immediate control of the arrestees, and that has been construed to mean the area from which an arrestee may gain, or might gain, access to a weapon or destructible evidence.

    He did indicate that he, if you will, he segregated them outside the car, spread them out a little bit, outside the vehicle. 
    That was the extent as to what he did. 
    He couldn't secure because he didn't have but one pair of handcuffs. 
    Exactly, Your Honor. 
    We believe that under the Chimel case that we have to ask ourselves, under these circumstances could any one of these arrestees or occupants of this vehicle approach that vehicle, rush or overpower the officer, and of course obtain the evidence which was on, in the back seat, in the jackets, in this particular case? 
    Now, these jackets, we certainly can presume, were shed at some point in time by the occupants.

    Your Honor, the Court of Appeals, the court below in this particular case, took the position that when Trooper Nicot placed these four occupants of the vehicle under arrest, that there was some magic in the officer with these four occupants of the vehicle, placed under arrest, that automatically they were subservient to each and every command of that officer at the vehicle. 
    I think that this is quite frankly absurd. 
    I think, at this point in time, the exclusive control, the Court of Appeals held, of that whole scene... in other words, now the scene is stabilized, as far as the majority of the court was concerned, once he placed the individuals under arrest and of course ordered them out of the vehicle.

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    Took them to the police station, and ultimately to the magistrate, in that particular area, that's correct, Your Honor. 
    This Court in Robinson stated that it's not certainly necessary for the officer to calculate at the scene, to consider whether or not a weapon may be present, but rather the arrest itself automatically triggers, if you will, the search incident to that arrest, which includes the area of the arrestee, as I stated before, as well as the person of the arrestee, In Robinson, of course, it was the person of the arrestee from which the cigarette container was obtained. 
    To say that the... as I stated before... that the officer had the exclusive control of the jacket at the time that he picked the same up, I think the Solicitor General in his brief points out that such a construction of exclusive control of this standard would in effect render Chimel meaningless in terms of searching of portable items in the area of the particular arrestee, as existed in this particular case.

    That set forth the area to be searched. 
    I'm taking it certainly a step further, Your Honor, in saying that the area from which a particular defendant or accused person, arrestee, may obtain a weapon or contraband, certainly should apply in this particular case to anything that's in that area reachable by this defendant to, should we say, assault the officer or destroy the evidence.

    There were two offenses that had been committed, one by the driver in speeding, and then secondly all four, presumably, were in possession of marijuana.

    Yes. 
    We're asking, Your Honors, if you will, the Court to set down a standard or guideline, if you will, in these type of cases, that is, the search incident to lawful arrest cases. 
    There has been a lot of different holdings in the state courts, some commentators have looked at the area of search incident to lawful arrest and come forward with certain criteria that we think ought to apply. 
    That is... and be considered, certainly, by the officer at the time of the arrest, as well as by the courts. 
    We would like to see this come from this court and the other lower courts. 
    That is, the number of arrestees as opposed to the number of police officers at the time of the arrest. 
    What restraint if any has been imposed upon the arrestee at the time of the arrest?

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I thought in Robinson we said that regardless of whether or not in a particular case all of the factors might not add up to considerable danger, if it was a custodial arrest, the rule was that there could be a full field search?

    The location... another criteria... the location of the arrestees in relation to the automobile and the ease or difficulty to be encountered by the arrestees in gaining access again to the weapon or the destructible evidence, the area, if you will, of the arrest. 
    And we believe that we're not looking for any particular rigid or inflexible guidelines by this Court, but rather to look at each case where there is a search without a warrant under a recognized rule such as the search incident to lawful arrest, which we believe is here, that we should have some guidelines for the courts below--

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    On the outside of the jacket; correct, Your Honor. 
    The respondent relies heavily on Chadwick and Sanders in this particular brief. 
    I believe these cases certainly were rightly decided, properly decided. 
    I think that Chadwick clearly... the police officers had exclusive control of the 200 pound trunk some one hour and a half after they'd arrested the defendants or taken them to the police station. 
    And I believe in Sanders the search incident argument was never made under those particular circumstances and clearly these two cases are distinguishable. 
    It's our position, Your Honors, that the court below should be reversed and the conviction reinstated on the theory that this was in all respects a proper search incident to lawful arrest.

   Argument of Andrew L. Frey
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1614.841" stopTime="1800.543">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Respondent has asserted in his brief that we wholly disagree with the arguments of the state, and I just wanted to begin by making the point that we do not disagree with the state in its arguments that this was within the Chimel scope, focusing on the facts of the case and the reasonableness of the officer's actions under the particular facts of the case. 
    We think that, however, that that kind of inquiry which is amply... the state's position is amply supported, if it be made in this case, is not an inquiry that needs to be made. 
    Our argument addresses, then, the question of whether a valid search incident to an arrest can be justified solely by reference to the spatial limitations; that is, whether it comes within the Chimel scope, and the temporal limitations during the arrest process. 
    We were concerned about the exclusive control notion which both the New York Court of Appeals in this case and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Benson case, in which we have a cert petition pending, have imported from Chadwick, where I think it had quite a different meaning and intention, into this situation. 
    Our argument in this case, contrary to what respondent has suggested in his brief, is not intended to undermine either thoroughly, as he says, or in any way, Chimel, or Chadwick, or Sanders. 
    It doesn't call the validity of those decisions into question at all. 
    The permissible scope of the search of the person of an arrestee incident to arrest has been settled in Robinson and that scope is broad indeed. 
    This case concerns the aspect of a search incident doctrine involving a search of containers or items of some kind that are nearby but not on the person or being worn by the arrested individual. 
    And our position is that such nearby items like the items on the person should be subject to the same test for a valid search incident to arrest as long as the search is made during the period of the arrest. 
    We would not contend, with respect to a separate container that may have been seized, that the Edwards principle that a search incident to arrest can occur later, would be applicable to such containers. 
    Now, the first question in analyzing the case is whether, when the officer went and seized respondent's jacket, the jacket was at that time within the spatial area defined by this Court's opinion in Chimel.

    Well, I would have... I don't think that the Court held in Chadwick that a search then and there would necessarily not have been incident to arrest. 
    So, if we had such a case it would be arguable, but I doubt that I would argue it. 
    Now, whatever the outer boundaries of the spatial area that Chimel defines as incident to arrest, which is the area from which you arrest, a person might gain possession of a weapon, or destructible evidence, is a matter that necessarily has to be delineated from case to case, and this Court has not had very much occasion to do so. 
    But I would note that if the arrested individual is standing unsecured outside his automobile, I think the interior of the automobile, not the trunk, but the interior passenger compartment, is under Adams v. Williams, would have been in the scope of search and seizure.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll resume there at one o'clock.

    Mr. Frey, you may continue.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1999.508" stopTime="2134.012">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I think when the Court recessed I was discussing the spatial limitations, the limitations of the Chimel test. 
    And it is our view, and I think Adams v. Williams is precedent for this, that the interior of a car is within the spatial grabbing area for a person who is standing right outside the car at the time of arrest. 
    But the decision of the court of appeals here and of the 8th Circuit in our Benson case seems to go beyond that and suggests that even though an item is seized from within the Chimel area, there is a separate inquiry whether at the time it is searched it is within the exclusive control of the officer searching it. 
    And that test, which as far as I know, is novel to our jurisprudence prior to Chadwick, comes from certain language that was used in Chadwick, and I think in a quite different context. 
    There are several difficulties that we perceive with the exclusive control notion that has been used by the lower court in several of these cases. 
    First, I would make the point that it runs afoul of the holding in Adams v. Williams, which was a case where, according to the record that was the appendix in this Court, Williams had been arrested. 
    The officer then waited until additional officers arrived on the scene, at which point the car was searched. 
    Now, it was not a subject of analysis in the Court's opinion, but the Court did uphold the search of the car and the seizures of the heroin found in the car as incident to William's arrest. 
    The same is true in Draper where, I assume, at the time the zipper bag was searched it was within the exclusive control of the officer in this sense. 
    And the problem with the exclusive control test, the way it's being used, is that it essentially eliminates searches of any item that is capable of being picked up and carried away by the officer as incident to arrest.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No, but it was a point that was discussed in the Court's opinion, and in just a second I will get to what the Court said about it because I think it is important. 
    But I wanted to make the point first that the nature of a search of an item, a parcel, a jacket, a purse, or something like that, in order to be searched it really has to be within the control of the officer. 
    Presumably the officer and the arrested individual are not having a tug of war over the item. 
    So in the sense that in Benson and in this case the court seemed to have used exclusive control, it totally eliminates search incident to arrest of items that are not on the person of the individual.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2223.236" stopTime="2234.393">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I take it you will take some note of the fact that in Chadwick the search was not at the time or place of the arrest but long after?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2234.393" stopTime="2256.723">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I was just coming to that point. 
    What was omitted in the discussion of Chadwick is the language that immediately preceded the exclusive control language in which the Court said that the potential danger lurking in all custodial arrests make warrantless searches of items within the immediate control area reasonable without requiring the arresting officer to calculate the probability of weapons--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2256.723" stopTime="2272.583">
    Justice White 
    I take it you wouldn't have suggested that in Chadwick that footlocker could have been searched if the arrested had taken place in the station, while they were sitting on... right after the dog had decided what was in the?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2272.583" stopTime="2282.606">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --If the arrest had taken place in the station and they had been sitting on it, I would say that it could have been searched incident to arrest but for the fact that it was locked and therefore it was not--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2282.606" stopTime="2284.522">
    Justice White 
    Well, "but for" is... that's a rather big "but for", is it not?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2284.522" stopTime="2387.003">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --That is the big "but for". 
    But in any event we did not make the argument. 
    But the point in Chadwick was that the Court was merely referring to settled doctrine which had been settled in Preston, that a search subsequent to, some hours later, after the arrest has been completed, is no longer incident to the arrest. 
    It was not at all talking about a situation of a search contemporaneous with the arrest. 
    Indeed, the exclusive control argument seems to me totally inconsistent with Robinson, because in Robinson, as Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent, at the time the cigarette pack was searched it was in the control of the officer. 
    The officer could have taken it and put it away somewhere out of the reach of the arrested individual. 
    Therefore it seems to me that once the Court has rejected that with respect to items removed from the person of the individual, there is precious little logical basis for treating it differently if the item is found nearby. 
    Earlier, during my brother's argument, the question came up about whether he had been wearing a jacket, carrying a jacket, had it down on the park bench, or so on. 
    Of course, once, if the jacket is removed from his person and the officer is holding it and he starts looking through its pockets, he has exclusive control in the sense that the lower courts were talking about. 
    So I don't see any justification in this Court's cases which I think are fairly consistent in this area for saying that if the item is sitting next to the person or sitting five feet away, that the scope of a permissible search incident to arrest is any different from--

    Justice White 
    Well, you don't think that there's any inference to be drawn from Chadwick that the search in that case could not have been justified as a search incident to arrest?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2399.663" stopTime="2411.905">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --What Chadwick held was that the search at the station house, an hour and a half later, after the people were presumably locked in cells someplace else, could not be justified as incident to the arrest. 
    We don't question that holding here. 
    But--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2411.905" stopTime="2433.401">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You think that you would be making the argument you would be making now if when they arrested the people, just as they were, while the footlocker was in the station wagon, that they could have searched the footlocker incident to arrest except for the fact it was locked?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2433.401" stopTime="2513.869">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --Except for the lock. 
    Except for the locking. 
    And I wanted to make the point that there is talk about the privacy interest, and the high privacy interest in the pockets of the jacket and so on. 
    And I think when we are dealing with... that argument would be very pertinent to the Robbins case which was argued earlier today, where the question is whether or not a warrant is required. 
    That argument is either wholly irrelevant or at least not very significant when we are talking about a search incident to arrest, because the search incident to arrest is not justified by probable cause. 
    There is no question of a warrant. 
    I think the Court made the point in a footnote in Chadwick that when you are dealing with a type of search like an inventory search, which is not justified by probable cause, cases dealing with the warrant requirement are not really opposite. 
    The argument is particularly inappropriate, it seems to me, when you're dealing with a jacket, because a jacket is, of course, the very kind of thing that is most likely to be subject to a search incident to arrest, since a person will usually be wearing it or carrying it at the time of arrest. 
    The fortuitous fact that he had put it down in the car does not matter as long as at the time it was seized it's still within the Chimel geographical scope of the area within which a search incident is permissible.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If... I suppose what you're driving at is that, conceivably, the officer might have said to the four of them, you get in your car, and don't get more than two car lengths ahead of me and go to the station?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2528.446" stopTime="2541.520">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That is one of the important reasons for the search incident, when you have a number of items like this. 
    The officer may have to know what disposition can be appropriately made, which ones of them are dangerous, might... you know, he has to locate weapons or--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2541.520" stopTime="2550.559">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But now you're going to destruction of the evidence if that had happened without any preliminary search. 
    He could have dropped the cocaine out the window of the car. 
    Is that your point?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2550.559" stopTime="2572.392">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --That would be a risk, yes. 
    I mean, that's one of the reasons why you permit the search incident to arrest is that you have these items of property that are in the area of the arrested individual and as part of the process of stabilizing the situation you have to determine which items are dangerous or contain evidence, so that you know how to handle them.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    They started off and the sequence of events were as indicated by Mr. Harvey except for one thing left out. 
    They were taken out and first patted down. 
    The officer then went back into the car and discovered a small quantity of marijuana. 
    Then he went out and thoroughly searched them and spread them out, and he said, at the back of the car. 
    He then went into the car and patted the jacket down first, and indicated that he felt nothing that would indicate a weapon at all.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    It does not apply under Chimel. 
    If I might, Chimel indicated that it's not everything in a room, to use Justice Stewart's language, not everything in a room which would be subject to search, only those things in the examples used were, perhaps, a gun in front of the individual; perhaps a drawer in front of the individual; but certainly not the entire room. 
    That was the Rabinowitz standard, which was rejected by this Court 12 years ago in Chimel. 
    And that's the point that happens here. 
    We have to bear deference to the officer's description of the event and to the ringside seat that he had of the event, where he indicates that there was no reason for him whatsoever to draw his gun; he felt absolutely no danger to himself, which is one of the twin prongs of Chimel.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I might indicate that when the question was asked of him he was quick to respond, as the record shows, there was just no need for that at any time. 
    He had certainly separated them, as he indicated, he had patted them down, he had searched them totally, and then he went back into the car.

speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2810.962" stopTime="2845.985">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that we have to deal with the record the way it exists. 
    And under the record the way it exists the car acted as a barrier between these individuals and the jacket which was on the back seat at the time, and not as an open area. 
    For example, it's not even as good as being in the open room described in Chimel, where the Court said you couldn't search all of the various drawers. 
    It's better, in this situation, because the cubicle in which the officer was is different than where the individuals were standing. 
    There was, in fact, a barrier created here, and to demonstrate--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2845.985" stopTime="2855.840">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but how long would it have taken four of them, acting unison, to have frustrated the officer's search?

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --I think that the only thing we could do is hypothesize that that perhaps could be possible. 
    If we were to do that, I respectfully submit, Justice Rehnquist, there would never be a Chimel exception, because in every set of circumstances we could say, under some conceivable set of facts someone would be able to go into, let's say, the entire room. 
    Or if it were in one room of the house, maybe all the other rooms, they could bolt out the door and go into the other rooms. 
    So therefore we ought to be able to search all of the rooms in the house. 
    I don't think we've ever had that.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    The point that I think again, the appellate division here, and, I submit, the Government is attempting to say by citing Adams v. Williams and the other cases, that we should scrap Chimel, that we should adopt the Robinson standard for the area, as opposed to what it stands for which is the person. 
    Robinson says that we find that the arrest itself is enough of an intrusion so that those matters immediately associated with the body are subsumed in the invasion of privacy. 
    But that's not--

    So that if we're talking about, specifically, Opperman, the glove compartment or the trunk or the common areas of the car, the car, since it's highly regulated, since it is an area with windows and so on, does not enjoy the same expectation of privacy as their private garments.

    But Opperman was an inventory search of an abandoned car. 
    Isn't that somewhat different from this?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3050.031" stopTime="3076.431">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that if we then go to inventory, we're talking of something other than the Fourth Amendment. 
    We're talking of something that certainly wasn't done here, and something that under Opperman could be done. 
    The question would then be, how far could you go with the inventory? 
    Would it be enough to simply list the jacket without going into the pocket? 
    Each pocket was zippered. 
    The testimony is, one was in fact closed. 
    They were all closed. 
    The testimony was one was zippered and had to be opened.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The purpose of an inventory search is in part, at least, to protect the officers from claims of possible theft or disappearance of the materials, so they would go into the pockets if they were going to make an inventory, would they not?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3088.156" stopTime="3090.941">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, what good would it do them to make an inventory search if they didn't look in the pockets?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3094.143" stopTime="3122.294">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --My recollection of Opperman is that it depends upon their local rules and regulations as to what they can do and what they can't do in the inventory situation. 
    Now, in this case, I think that it bears emphasis that the officer did exactly what this Court indicated in Sanders and in Chadwick should be done, and that is, he took the jacket with him. 
    He stated clearly, I had it in my possession. 
    This was after the arrest.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3122.294" stopTime="3131.316">
    Justice White 
    Mr. Cambria, there never was any finding in this case, was there, that there was probable cause to search the jacket?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3131.316" stopTime="3131.816">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3131.816" stopTime="3137.654">
    Justice White 
    And the claim is that it should be searched just incident to arrest, whether there is probable cause or not?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3137.654" stopTime="3139.522">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    That was the claim that was first made--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3139.522" stopTime="3140.955">
    Justice White 
    Yes. 
    And it is still is, isn't it?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3140.955" stopTime="3141.572">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3141.572" stopTime="3155.615">
    Justice White 
    It still is. 
    On that basis, if it isn't searchable incident to arrest, it wouldn't be searchable at all, because unless somebody found there was probable cause?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3155.615" stopTime="3160.000">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I would say that probable cause wouldn't make the difference as it did not in Sanders.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3160.000" stopTime="3166.089">
    Justice White 
    Well, I know, I know, but in this case you would still have the problem of proving probable cause, if you went for a warrant.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3166.089" stopTime="3244.355">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No question about that, that there wouldn't be any probable cause for this specific jacket. 
    That would be the argument made. 
    But even if there were, assuming arguendo were the same as Sanders, it was considered by this Court in the footnote, as indicated to be dicta by the Government, but the fact remains that the individuals in Sanders were there in close proximity to this unlocked attache case, and the same argument could have been made with regard to that case. 
    But it wasn't made. 
    And I submit it wasn't made because it wasn't supported by the record in that case. 
    Like in this case, there is absolutely no pronouncement at all that these materials were within the grabbable reach of these individuals. 
    If we try to uphold this on Adams v. Williams, which I think is totally irrelevant to this consideration for this reason: in Adams v. Williams there is probable cause to believe, as a result of a reliable tip, that there is an armed and dangerous individual seated in an automobile, and the officer approaches the individual, asks him to get out; he doesn't get out, he rolls the window down. 
    The officer reaches in, pats in the area, and finds a weapon... immediately finds a weapon. 
    Then he takes him out and searches... no containers... searches the common areas of the car.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3244.355" stopTime="3256.147">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Cambria, you wouldn't... if he had patted down this jacket, which he did, and he had discovered something that it felt like a gun, you still wouldn't suggest that he could search it, would you?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3256.147" stopTime="3259.099">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Not under the... no, for two reasons; no.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3259.099" stopTime="3264.169">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, yes. 
    Well, you'd make the same argument you're making now: if you want to get into the jacket, you go get a warrant.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3264.169" stopTime="3265.636">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that's exactly correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3265.636" stopTime="3268.038">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then you would have probable cause, maybe, to believe there's something in the jacket.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3268.038" stopTime="3271.990">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    The difference is that in Adams v. Williams the gun is immediately--

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    And in our case, at no time... and that's why there's been an allusion to the Draper standard; Draper is different. 
    There the piece searched was immediately associated with the individual's taking from it. 
    And another day, I'm sure--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3288.034" stopTime="3292.086">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it was taken from him, and once it was taken from him, it was in complete control of the officer.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Yes... in my argument it was never taken from any of the defendants.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --No, because I think in this case the court below, the decision below was, that at no time were these materials within the Chimel standard. 
    They talk of Chimel, talk about Chimel, and specifically distinguish their decision from a case called People v. DeSantis. 
    People v. DeSantis was a Draper case where a briefcase was in the hand of an individual and taken from him at that time. 
    And the court of appeals made it quite clear, below, we are not talking about that, we are talking about the facts before us, which are that there's never any immediate association between the jackets and the individuals after the arrests, so--

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    And I think that it is. 
    It falls into two categories. 
    As to the petitioners, it falls into whether or not it comes within Chimel, which is grabbable reach. 
    As to the Government, it falls within whether or not you are going to expand Robinson and in effect subsume Chimel by saying, as long as you're arrested, the police have the right to search the area, whether or not the materials in the area are within the grabbable reach of the individual.

    You don't know whether it's within reach, grabbable or otherwise, until you see it.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3630.900" stopTime="3681.833">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, I might indicate that in Chimel the opinion covered closed drawers, open drawers; plain view, not in plain view; many areas. 
    What I'm suggesting is that if we were to adopt the government's side of this, we would be extinguishing Chimel, because we wouldn't have to concern ourselves anymore with whether or not there was a grabbable reach problem; we would simply say, in the vein of Robinson, are you arrested? 
    Does that in fact cause a breach of your privacy? 
    If so, is it just incidental to search the matters around you? 
    That was what was rejected by the court of appeals below because that was the finding of the appellate division here. 
    There has never been a finding that these materials came within the Chimel grabbable reach.

    --What I am suggesting is that we should not... and the Court has not, in the past... adopted a place or area requirement, but has in fact employed this grabbable reach element. 
    And if we take the precedent of this Court simply from the Chimel standpoint, it's not only not established by the petitioners in this case, it's not even remotely established by the facts in this case, since, as indicated, the officer did something that would show that by following the procedure here, he's certainly not deprived of any law enforcement activity, because he in fact took the jacket with him; had the people to such a degree of control that they first stopped at the police barracks, then they went on to the court; the same individuals are with him. 
    He had it, as he said, in his possession and secured. 
    So we're not in any way attempting to frustrate law enforcement. 
    We're simply saying when you're not within the Chimel confines, then you have it in your possession; take it to a magistrate.

    If this jacket had been on the seat beside the driver, it would have been reachable before the driver got out of the car. 
    Under the right to search incident to arrest, if the driver was still sitting at the steering wheel the officer I take it could then have searched the jacket, if it lay on the seat beside him.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3811.363" stopTime="3815.984">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    If it was within his grabbable reach, under Chimel, I think that I would be foolish to argue otherwise.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3815.984" stopTime="3822.988">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    --So that the difference really is whether or not the officer asked for the jacket before or after the driver stepped out of the car?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3822.988" stopTime="3883.026">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, I don't think that that's the difference. 
    I think the difference is that at the time the people were placed under arrest and again, recognizing the two bases for Chimel, was there a basis for believing destruction of evidence or a danger to the officer? 
    And was that manifested by the jacket being within the grabbable reach of the arrestee? 
    That was the actual issue. 
    Because the Court has never said that for any type of arrest, when it's not within the Chimel reach, that you can simply search the entire area, search all of the possessions, or even the car, for that matter. 
    So what I'm indicating is, the critical time, as this Court has repeatedly said and most recently in Sanders is at the time of the arrest and at the time of the search; that's when we measure the facts. 
    And as I'm indicating, here when we measure the facts, as the court below obviously interpreted the record... and the record itself is clear, the state has not carried their burden.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I don't think that there is a distinction between articles within an automobile and articles in a residence, or articles anywhere else, if they are private receptacles, and I don't think there's much argument here that these are not, then the question is, as it was in Sanders and the other cases, that we don't give up the privacy simply because they happened to be in an automobile or because they're somewhere else.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What do you do with our Edwards case then, which said that although the search took place an hour and a half after the arrest or two hours after the arrest, since it could have been done at the time of the arrest, it was good at two hours afterwards?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="3931.959" stopTime="3980.273">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that there is a vast difference between Edwards and this case, because in Mr. Edwards' situation we're talking about his clothes, which were totally immediately associated with him because he was wearing them. 
    There was, therefore, a great jeopardy that the paint flakes which were on the clothes could have been destroyed by him, which was the very evidence that they were attempting to preserve in the case. 
    So there was a vast difference between this case and that case. 
    In that case, if we take one of the two forks of Chimel, which is preservation of evidence immediately associated with the person, Edwards falls directly within that. 
    If we take my case, where the material is immediately associated with the police officer and at no time after the arrest and search associated with my client, then we have none of the two-pronged basis for Chimel.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3980.273" stopTime="3996.551">

    You certainly have the temporal disparity in Edwards that you do not have here and that you don't have in Chimel.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Well, I don't think we have a temporal difference in Edwards since, one is he was wearing the garment, it was always in danger of having whatever evidence was contained on it being destroyed. 
    So it was a contemporaneous search, no matter what had happened, until you separated the individual from the clothing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4015.696" stopTime="4019.333">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, so then it makes no difference when the person is arrested?

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, it would make a difference under Preston, certainly. 
    That would be an additional factor, one that's not involved here but one that was involved in Preston, which was also involved in Edwards. 
    I mean, I would say that that is another ground upon which to invalidate a search and seizure, if there's a temporal variation, difference; which we don't have.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4044.115" stopTime="4048.500">

speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4048.500" stopTime="4089.144">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, it did not invalidate it, and I submit, because of several unique factors. 
    One was, apparently they didn't have any clothes for the man until sometime... it was late at night, and they had taken him down to the cell; that was their normal procedure to do that. 
    And again, the evidence was apparently clinging to his very outer garments at all times, and they... at least the way I read that case... acted as quickly as possible under the circumstances. 
    So the time was really not a factor because it was a constant jeopardy, whereas, certainly, here there is nothing like that at all. 
    As we have indicated, maybe with regard to these facts the officer had the jacket, readily admitted it, at all times.

    Mr. Cambria, maybe this is too trivial a question, but you have used the term "grabbable reach" repeatedly.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes.

    Is a grabbable reach a greater or a lesser area than a just plain reach?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4100.785" stopTime="4144.814">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Well, I think that grabbable reach, in the sense of being able to reach the materials, that's the way I interpret Chimel; readily reach the materials immediately. 
    The words are used, immediately, ready at reach, ready to hand, are some of the other words that have been used, which I think is much different than this situation, but there's never been a claim, by proof, that any of this was ready to hand, at any time. 
    And of course, that's the way the court of appeals saw it below, and it is my contention that based upon the record that we have here, not very... pardon me?

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr.

    Never. 
    There was never any findings in this case that it was within the grabbable reach.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4206.638" stopTime="4211.225">

    The opinion was to the effect that in the last footnote of the chief judge's opinion he said, we search the record in vain in an attempt to find the facts which support, the dissenting justice is Gabrielli, his statement that this was ready to hand or within their reach. 
    It isn't there; nowhere.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I think that when it appears in a majority opinion and they... as perhaps this Court in its majority opinion in talking of certain things mentioned in dissents, when you say, we have in essence construed the record and we find no proof whatsoever that this is within the grabbable reach, I think that's a finding of fact. 
    Because on the other hand, if they would have found to the contrary, then I feel they would have been bound by Chimel, and they have discussed Chimel, clearly, and said that it simply did not come within the confine of Chimel. 
    I think it is most certainly a finding of fact in this case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Cambria, I take it that when you arrest someone in connection with a car, if you want to go beyond your grabbable reach range, you'll have to rely on the automobile search, the automobile theory, which requires probable cause to believe that where you are searching you may find what you're searching for?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4299.064" stopTime="4309.603">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    And then only as to those items listed by this Court in Opperman, which would be items immediately associated with a car: trunk, glove compartment, wheel wells, fender wells, and so on.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4309.603" stopTime="4313.621">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I think you also have to have probable cause to believe you're going to find something in those areas.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4313.621" stopTime="4327.048">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No question about it. 
    I think there's no doubt about it. 
    There has to be a pleading situation, plus there has to be the limited expectation of privacy as to the areas being searched, and certainly not packages which are within the car itself.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="4327.048" stopTime="4343.308">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Cambria, when you... as I understand the facts here, after the officer stopped the car, the driver rolled down the left window of the car, and the officer when he went into the back seat was on one side of the car and the four individuals were on the other side. 
    Were they on the left side or the right side of the car?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4343.308" stopTime="4354.881">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, the only testimony here is that he took the individuals out to the rear of the car, that he first split them up and patted them all down. 
    He went back into the car, found some minor--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="4354.881" stopTime="4356.567">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Which door did he go in, do you know?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4356.567" stopTime="4359.519">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --He, I believe, indicated the driver's door.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="4359.519" stopTime="4361.702">

    He went in the driver's door. 
    I see.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4361.702" stopTime="4362.721">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Then he came back out--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="4362.721" stopTime="4368.089">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But if the window was open, I suppose it's conceivable, even though they're outside the car, they could have reached in and grabbed the jacket.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4368.089" stopTime="4374.379">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --However, the record doesn't support that.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Cambria, let me go back to the footnote that you have referred to in Chief Judge Cooke's opinion, at A-81 of the Appendix. 
    He says, 
    "One searches the record in vain for support of the dissenter's claim that at the time of arrest... the point from which the predicate for the warrantless search is measured #. " 
    Then he goes on, 
    "Indeed, the facts, as found at the suppression hearing and affirmed by the Appellate Division, were to the effect that the jacket was searched after the defendant was removed from the vehicle and then placed under arrest. "
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4431.762" stopTime="4432.464">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4432.464" stopTime="4442.070">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Now, that suggests more the exclusive control type of thing that the Government is arguing against, rather than the grabbable reach thing.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4442.070" stopTime="4472.423">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    I think, in this case, that the court of appeals decision can be read to say, since it was in the exclusive control of the officer and it was not within the grabbable reach of the defendants, then it doesn't fit within the Chimel doctrine. 
    And I think that's exactly what that footnote stands for, by saying, we have it in the police officer's possession which, under Chadwick and Sanders, he should therefore take it down to and have the magistrate examine it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4472.423" stopTime="4482.714">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you agree with the United States, I gather, if the court of appeals, if the opinion below is read as establishing a control test, you don't defend that?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4482.714" stopTime="4492.653">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    That established a control... if there would have been testimony in this case that the material was within the grabbable reach of the individuals, it would be a different case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4492.653" stopTime="4506.079">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know. 
    But if a man is carrying his jacket when he gets out of the car and they arrest him and the officer takes his jacket from him, then it's under the complete control of the officer.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="4506.079" stopTime="4506.595">

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    We are in a better position than that case. 
    There we have the arrestees standing by the trunk at the time, two of them, and this unlocked briefcase is pulled out of an open trunk, at that time. 
    My case is entirely different than that. 
    We have people outside and he's inside, and so on. 
    And so that's why. 
    But I say this, Sanders and Chadwick are involved to the degree that we have to deal with the Government's argument which is, just the arrest alone gives you the area or the zone of search. 
    I say it does not because under Chadwick and Sanders we have a privacy expectation in these articles. 
    The petitioner's case, of course, deals with Chimel squarely. 
    And as I've indicated, the record does not support their claim at all.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    No, it was not raised, and it finds no support in the record. 
    One of the clarifications I might make is that it was after the time of the discovery of the cocaine that the officer then said, whose jacket is this? 
    And that's when there was a disclaimer. 
    But he had already conducted his search prior to the time he elicited--

    Mr. James R. Harvey 
    Since I still have a couple minutes, Your Honor, if it please the Court: 
    The only point I would make is that the Chimel criteria as set forth by the Court defines the area as the area that the arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary material. 
    And I think that's here, certainly, in this case on the record on certainly one of two theories. 
    Either the overpowering theory, and I think quite frankly that's the theory that's here clearly on the record below--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If we take your view, I take it that any container in a car, any piece of evidence in a car, or in the interior of the car, or anything in any container in the car, is searchable and seizable incident to the arrest?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    It wouldn't have made any difference... to you it wouldn't have made any difference whether the jacket was on the floor, or the back seat, or anywhere in the interior of the car, or whether what the officer seized was a briefcase?
