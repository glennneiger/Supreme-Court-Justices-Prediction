    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. 
    The charter of the Democratic Party of the United States provides that delegates to its National Convention shall be chosen through procedures in which only Democrats can participate. 
    Consistently with the charter, the National Party's Delegate Selection Rules provide that only those who are willing to affiliate publicly with the Democratic Party may participate in the process of selecting delegates to the Party's National Convention. 
    The question on this appeal is whether Wisconsin may successfully insist that its delegates to the Convention be seated, even though those delegates are chosen through a process that includes a binding state preference primary election in which voters do not declare their party affiliation. 
    The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the National Convention is bound by the Wisconsin primary election results, and cannot refuse to seat the delegates chosen in accord with Wisconsin law. 
    For the reasons set out at some length in the opinion of the Court filed today, the judgement is reversed. 
    Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist have joined.
