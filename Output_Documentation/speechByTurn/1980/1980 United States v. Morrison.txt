    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit after the respondent, Hazel Morrison was indicted on a drug charge. 
    And after she had retained counsel, government agents called upon her. 
    They sought her cooperation in a related case and among other things disparage her retained lawyer and suggested that he'd be replaced. 
    She would have none of it and reported the entire affair to her counsel. 
    She then moved to her counsel to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated.S 
    he alleged no specific prejudice to her case but nevertheless insisted that the indictment be dismissed. 
    The -- when the motion was denied, she pled guilty pursuant to a plea -- plea bargain with the Government. 
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and held not only that her Sixth Amendment rights had been violated, but that the conviction should be set aside in the indictment dismissed. 
    We brought the case here on certiorari at the Government's request, we reversed. 
    We hold that in the absence of showing some prejudice to the adequacy of her representation or some other impact -- adverse impact on the fairness of the trial or on the proceedings that it was error to order the indictment dismissed. 
    Accordingly, the judgment below is -- is reversed and the Court is unanimous in this regard.
