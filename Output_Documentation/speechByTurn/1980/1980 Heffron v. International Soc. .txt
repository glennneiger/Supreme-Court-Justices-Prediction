    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    My name is Kent Harbison and I represent the petitioners in this case, those Minnesota officials charged with the responsibility of managing the annual Minnesota State Fair. 
    The question before this Court is whether that State Fair, consistent with the First Amendment, may enforce a rule that essentially provides that all those persons or organizations who participate in the annual affair who desire to sell products, solicit monetary donations, or distribute literature or any other materials, whether it be flags, flowers, or whatever, may do so, but only from rented booths or similar fixed locations on the ground. 
    This case began in August of 1977 when the respondents, the Krishna Society, commenced a lawsuit in the state district court and obtained a temporary restraining order from that court enjoining the fair from enforcing that rule as it applies to them during that year's fair. 
    The restraining order, however, also enjoined the Krishnas themselves from selling any of these items that I've mentioned on a peripatetic basis throughout the fairgrounds. 
    In other words, the effect of that restraining order was to say, the state fair cannot require these respondents to engage in these activities only at a booth, but they must be permitted to do it throughout the fairgrounds.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, the restraining order applied to the '77 fair. 
    In 1978, just before the 1978 fair, the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state fair. 
    Therefore, the booth rule was applied during the 1978 fair because the state had received a favorable decision. 
    That was then appealed by the respondents to the Minnesota Supreme Court which reversed that decision in a 5-to-3 opinion. 
    That decision did not come down until, as I recall it, just before the 1980 fair. 
    This court then accepted the case to review it in January of this year.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    I'll attempt to see if I can add some definition to that. 
    The policy has always been, not just at that time or even now, under the booth rule... and that's the rule we're talking about here... that the state fair would not try to prevent anyone from engaging in oral conversations, and the phrase "proselytizing", the way I've intended to use it in the brief and I think the way the Minnesota Supreme Court viewed it, meant the practice of talking to someone and trying to convert them to a particular group's religious or political beliefs. 
    That statement on pages 35 and 36 is not meant to indicate that that's somehow a change of policy. 
    That's the way it has always been under the booth rule.

    And part of the reason as indicated in this case, the record shows that with respect to these respondents... and I think they indicate this in paragraph 11 of the stipulation... that they don't merely want to just distribute the flowers and the books and the magazines and the buttons or whatever it may be, but indeed, they want to collect money for them. 
    So there is always the monetary exchange that accompanies that sort of activity. 
    I'd like to give the Court a little bit of a factual outline of what the fair is like and the types of crowds and congestion that we're describing in our brief.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, only about 40 to 45 of those acres, or about one third of that area, comprises that part of the fairgrounds where most of the booth operations and the fairgoing traffic occurs. 
    The rest of it is parking lots and storage facilities and so forth.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    There's a racetrack, Your Honor. 
    There's a racetrack that's connected with the grandstand that... I don't think the record indicates... but it seats several thousand people. 
    There are in an average year more than 1.3 million people who attend this 12-day event and I emphasize it's not merely just a location, but it is an event that the state stages for a limited period each year. 
    That breaks down to about 115,000 people per day during the week in this 40-to-45 acre area, and approximately 160,000 people per day on weekends. 
    And as I said, the only requirement for those people to get into the fairgrounds is if they pay the customary admission fee.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Has it always been that size, or was it expanded after the automobile age came along?
speaker="kent_g_harbison" startTime="485.997" stopTime="545.119">
    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, I personally don't know that and I don't the record indicates that but my understanding is that the Minnesota State Fair has for many years been among the top two or three state fairs in the country in terms of size and number of fairgoers. 
    The booth rule that were talking about is an inherent inseparable part of the state fair, and that's in part because the state fair has a system called the space rental system. 
    And under that the state fair enters into lease agreements with all these organizations and people who desire to sell and solicit and distribute materials. 
    Under these lease agreements these people and organizations are required to conduct these activities at a booth that requires them to post an identification sign that clearly in some manner informs the fairgoing public as to who they are or at least gives them some idea of the nature of the booth operation.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    When you speak of the booths, are you including under that term the halls and areas where they have farm machinery and other machinery?
speaker="kent_g_harbison" startTime="555.825" stopTime="574.802">
    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The booth rule in a sense is somewhat of a misnomer in that we're not talking only about little stands and booths but I am using the term to mean fixed locations generally. 
    Sometimes it's inside buildings, sometimes it's a location known as Machinery Hill that perhaps Your Honor is referring to.

speaker="kent_g_harbison" startTime="598.585" stopTime="700.700">
    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, these are all organizations that have rented booths for a number of years from the state fair. 
    In fact, there are approximately 1,400 booth operations on the fairgrounds during the period covered by this case, and these organizations that you're referring to, Your Honor, represent at least 40 of the organizations who at the time were considered to qualify probably as religious or political or news media type organizations. 
    I think under the respondents' current proposal in their brief, that this be expanded to include charitable and noncommercial organizations as well. 
    I think it's likely that a significant number, in addition to these, of the 1,400 booth operators would qualify under that definition, whatever the definition may be. 
    But the rule, again, doesn't have any effect whatsoever on the ability or the right of anyone to engage in some communications or proselytizing, however you want to phrase it. 
    It relates primarily to the distribution and the monetary activities. 
    The respondents in this case are a religious organization whose members engage in an activity known as Sankirtan. 
    That consists of a number of aspects, singing, dancing, chanting, selling not only books but other tokens, and soliciting donations. 
    The first aspects of that, the first three, the singing, dancing, and chanting, the respondents don't claim or aren't pressing this Court or any other court that we're aware of as covered by their First Amendment arguments. 
    In other words, they're not... perhaps they would be covered by it, I suppose, but they're not pressing those claims. 
    We're only worried about the latter three.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Suppose the American Legion Drum and Bugle Corps wanted to have a parade through the streets and through the area to stimulate patriotic reactions, could they do that under these regulations?
speaker="kent_g_harbison" startTime="713.726" stopTime="944.560">
    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, they would not be able to do that, I think. 
    And not only so much because of the booth rule but because of the state fair management's inherent responsibility, as this Court recognized in Cox v. New Hampshire, which involved public streets, the responsibility to maintain some order so that they're not overlapping parades, if you will. 
    And I suggest that in this case there is even more evidence than there was in Cox v. New Hampshire that that sort of conflict would be posed. 
    The state fair would have a right and an obligation, in fact, to the public to control that sort of activity. 
    It doesn't mean that it couldn't occur. 
    It just means it would have to be done in an orderly fashion so that there would be some order in an already crowded area, 40 to 45 acres, which on a typical day would have between 100,000 and 200,000 people. 
    I'd like to mention one more factual point here, I think that is of interest to this case, and that is, after the 1977 restraining order, there were about 17 or 18 members of ISKCON or Krishnas who did participate in the fair and engage in these activities outside the confines of a booth. 
    That was consistent with the restraining order. 
    What was not consistent, however, was the fact that they did sell, they did engage in sales. 
    The restraining order basically said that if you wish to sell something you still have to do that from a booth, but the other aspects of the booth rule we enjoin... the court, meaning "we"... enjoin as to the Krishnas. 
    In addition, the record shows that even just during this five or six day period when these sales and solicitations were taking place, the Krishnas represented... I should say, misrepresented themselves to the potential donors and purchasers, indicating that they represented something called the Division of Natural Resources, and schools for needy and handicapped children, drug treatment programs, and indeed the state fair itself. 
    And there is also evidence that these sorts of things took place with respect to donors who were minors. 
    It's been suggested by the respondents that this booth rule is a totally preclusive regulation, and it strikes me that if that were the case it would be virtually impossible ever to have any sort of regulations that weren't preclusive in some way, and it would be impossible to apply the balancing test, the reasonable time, place, and manner test, because there was always going to be some preclusion. 
    In fact, I refer the Court to the alternative suggested by the Minnesota Supreme Court and by the respondents themselves as alleging, allegedly, less restrictive alternatives. 
    They themselves involve some preclusive aspects and again, the booth rule, not only does and doesn't do what I've already discussed, but it doesn't give the state fair or any state official any discretion whatsoever to determine whether or not someone shall abide by the rule or whether they shall not. 
    It's applied nondiscriminatorily on its face, and as applied it has absolutely no relationship to the ideology or the content of anyone's political or religious beliefs. 
    And as I said, it doesn't prohibit any sort of oral proselytizing or oral conversations at all. 
    One of the things at this stage of the case that I think is critical is that the respondents have now abandoned what I believe to be the basis, the key basis, for the Minnesota Supreme Court's decision. 
    That is, they're no longer making a claim that they are entitled to a single exemption from the booth rule because of some unique status that they have because of this practice of Sankirtan.

    It may be overstating it to say they have totally abandoned it. 
    It sounds to me in their brief now as if they're making some sort of an alternative argument. 
    But what sticks out to me, Your Honor, is the fact that I think they are recognizing that those aspects of Ankirtan that involve religious solicitations or whatever are no different than those of any other political or religious organization.

    We wouldn't have egresses I suppose, Your Honor. 
    Well, I think... we know that, we recognize that, Your Honor. 
    But what I'm saying is, to the extent that happens, and we acknowledge it, the state fair is more able to control that sort of thing at a booth because they know who the people are. 
    But, if one has a roving solicitor or vendor walking among 150,000, 200,000 people on a given day, in a 40 to 45-acre area, and sells somebody a record that's supposed to be a religious record and it turns out to be something totally different, or any other example, by the time that the purchaser or the donor is aware of that, there's no way you can do anything about it. 
    Now, it might be a little bit easier to pick out somebody in this kind of a crowd if they somehow appeared unique, but the indications are that these roving vendors and solicitors look pretty much like everyone else.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Absolutely nothing. 
    In fact, Your Honor, they did not apply for booth space. 
    They were informed that the booth rule existed and they informed the fair that they didn't feel they had to submit to it. 
    I'd like to make one comment about another argument that's raised in the respondents' brief, and that is that the primary purpose, despite what I've just gone through on these other purposes, the primary purpose of this rule is alleged to be to insulate potentially receptive listeners or audiences from all communications. 
    They have to take some affirmative step. 
    That is just plain wrong. 
    First, it seems to me that there is implicit in that some sort of improper motivation and I think the comment I just made about when the booth rule was enacted cuts against that. 
    But, the only difference with respect to that context, the only difference between a booth operator and a roving vendor is the ability to pursue and follow an unwilling audience or listener or purchaser or donor. 
    A booth operator cannot go after a fairgoer who walks by the booth and declines the sales pitch or the solicitation.

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    Your Honor, I don't know and the record doesn't indicate that. 
    I am sure the total gross revenues... and I don't know how it would be broken down, would be well over a million dollars. 
    I'd like to emphasize one final point here and then reserve some time for rebuttal, and that is that it seems to me that the booth rule does not prohibit booth operators from talking to fairgoers as they walk around, or trying to sell them something or solicit donations. 
    Roving solicitors simply have moving booths, that's all it is. 
    But the booth operator doesn't have the advantage to follow, pursue, harass, however you'd like to characterize it, fairgoers who aren't interested. 
    And I submit that's not enough of a justification. 
    The alternatives to the booth rule that are alleged to be less restrictive are both unworkable and I suspect constitutionally suspect because they would turn what is now a a non content directed rule into a regulation that inherently is going to require the state fair to look into the content and the religious basis of the organizations. 
    They're suggesting that the state fair could do this by registering all organizations who are charitable or noncommercial, whomever they may be. 
    The problem with that is, how does the fair determine that? 
    That sounds to me like the kind of regulation this Court struck down in Cantwell v. Connecticut. 
    I don't think the state fair, even if they're qualified, would constitutionally be able to do that. 
    The numerical limitations that have been suggested, the requirement to wear identification badges, sound nice in the abstract but in practice they wouldn't work; the state fair would have no way to guarantee that they were being complied with. 
    What we have here is not an attempt to suppress communication but an attempt by the state fair along this less restrictive continuum to draw the line.

   Argument of Laurence H. Tribe
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="1748.440" stopTime="1815.082">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The state in this case seeks to expel from the open and public areas of the state fair and to corral in these fixed booths, which indeed, as Mr. Harbison points out, are sometimes inside building, exercises of speech, press, and religion, which clearly lie at the very core of the First Amendment. 
    Now, I think a number of the questions that have been directed to Mr. Harbison expose in a way that perhaps the record and the briefs alone would not have done quite so dramatically the sweep and breadth of this rule. 
    Mr. Justice White asked, what about a politician walking around with information on a sign? 
    And Mr. Harbison says, perhaps that would be allowed. 
    But it appears, in the stipulated facts, as one might expect, since a rule against exhibiting or distributing literature can hardly draw much of a line between what you wear on your back and what you put in your palm and what you hand to someone, it appears that that might not be allowed at all.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, the overbreadth position that we take here, Mr. Chief Justice, we think is well founded in the Schaumberg case itself. 
    That is, we are dealing here with activity that is hardly at the periphery of the First Amendment. 
    We're dealing here with core First Amendment activity, distributing literature, and the fact that the law does reach that far is one of the reasons that this Court should strike it down.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    But aren't there going to be a large number of people, as suggested in Justice Todd's dissent, at A-73 of the Joint Appendix, who are going to be able to make the same claim as your clients, that they should be able to freely roam and proselytize? 
    And he comments there that under the existing rule fair officials cannot arbitrarily determine that some exhibitors are free to roam the fair grounds while others are not.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="1885.061" stopTime="1919.817">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    No, it's not arbitrary. 
    It's simply a flat exclusion, and I think that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the dissent below rightly pointed out that we were not claiming any special treatment. 
    Others would potentially be eligible to seek exemption. 
    But as this Court last month said in Thomas v. Indiana Review Board, simply conjuring up an unmanageable number of requests for exemptions without proof in the record that it would indeed be unmanageable through some neutral feeling on numbers, is not a permissible basis for suppressing protected activity.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    The language of the rule, we agree, pre dates their arrival, but it's interesting to note that the rule on its face says nothing about solicitation. 
    It's simply been interpreted to encompass solicitation now. 
    And the record doesn't itself illuminate the question of why the rule has been broadened to deal with solicitation. 
    In light of the problem suggested, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, by your question, about the degree to which one is genuinely free in the State Fair of Minnesota under this rule, looked at on its face, to wander around and proselytize orally. 
    We are assured by the Attorney General of Minnesota that one could quite freely indicate verbally, as long as one didn't have a sign on or hand out anything, that one represented a certain religion which was in need of funds, that there was a booth back there, that contributions might be made at the booth. 
    I am at a loss to know where the line is ever going to be drawn between that and solicitation.

    Mr. Tribe, I read recently, and I wouldn't want to vouch for what I read in the newspaper, but it suggested that there were 153 religious organizations in the State of California alone that would qualify under this category. 
    Now assume that's very high. 
    Could we take judicial notice, do you think, that there must be at least 100 religious organizations in the United States that could avail themselves of what you are urging?

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I am certain you could, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    And if you added political and charitable organizations, there might be more still. 
    But even if you take the Attorney General's representation and attempt to paint the chaos at its worst, that perhaps there would be a thousand proselytizers and solicitors and distributors in an area where there are over 115,000 visitors a day, even if we assume at worst that one out of 100 people is trying to persuade someone else to give money to a fledgling religion or to a rising candidacy, it seems to me the proposition that that in itself is the sort of specter the state can shut down protected speech and religious exercise to avoid will be consistent with the judgments of this Court.

    Well, it is true that the New York district court ruling now pending in this Court seeking certiorari before judgment has gone the other way, but in the majority of cases, in the 4th Circuit, in the 7th Circuit, in the Northern District of Texas, in a number of cases over the past four or five years, I would say the trend has been to say that because this is obviously a public forum, a literal marketplace of ideas, and because the concerns about congestion and fraud can be more narrowly met, that there has to be a relaxation of the rule when it comes to a religious group.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, historically, the fairs of Europe and Leipzig and in other places surely were primarily religious activities. 
    They did become more secular but the history of the Minnesota State Fair, not a typical in this country, shows that it has been a literal crossroads of cultural, religious, political, as well as commercial activity. 
    It was the favorite stopping point of presidential candidates in the early 20th century. 
    There's no suggestion here that it is a less appropriate place for the exchange of ideas than streets and parks where people usually go to get some place or to enjoy themselves. 
    There is no suggestion that it is less appropriate in any sense than the other places that this Court has suggested are public fora. 
    And in this kind of public forum to have a total ban on even distribution of literature with no commercial element, as Justice Stevens points out, with no problem of littering, when there are other methods of dealing with fraud and congestion, seems to us to be grossly overbroad.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I think that putting some reasonable ceiling numerically, as the respondents in this case have said they would be willing to live with, is perfectly constitutional. 
    The fact that something is a public forum... a courtroom... a public forum in which people can come and listen, doesn't mean that more people than can be accommodated for its purpose must be permitted to be there.

    It would be so incompatible with the function and decorum of this courtroom, for the people here to walk around, in contrast with the state fair, that I'm sure the answer's no.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I think the quiet and tranquillity and the educational function of these halls is incompatible with that kind of wandering, although I must admit I haven't carefully enough thought about it to want to be held to that. 
    A state fair is at the other end of the spectrum, surely.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2371.890" stopTime="2384.984">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Is not a state fair fundamentally an educational function and in a state like Minnesota, agriculture and agricultural machinery, and a great many other things?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2384.984" stopTime="2413.651">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    But educational, not in the sense that a library is, where people wander and carefully, quietly, calmly select. 
    It's educational in the sense that the cross fire of ideas and options and opinions makes it a saturation place for exposure. 
    It's for that very reason that respondents find it such an attractive and important place to expose people to the possibility that what the respondents believe in really merits their attention.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2413.651" stopTime="2446.288">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, the lower Great Hall here, to pursue that, is a museum of sorts and people look at the pictures of the Justices of times gone by and read their biographies attached, and look at a great many things relating to the Court's history. 
    They are free to talk about it all they want as long as they don't create a disturbance. 
    How would the peripatetic missionary be any more or less a problem downstairs than at the state fair?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2446.288" stopTime="2524.572">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, that because people come to this Court for a much more specific purpose and with a particular event or set of events in mind, it would not be nearly so difficult to justify the proposition that the purposes of the Court, like the purposes of a library or of the White House or of some other special building, are incompatible with quite the same kind of robust, wide open discussion and distribution and solicitation that clearly is compatible with the function of a fair. 
    But again this Court needn't decide exactly how many institutions and fora are brought within the principle. 
    There's no claim made by the State of Minnesota in this case, and no proposition adduced by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, to the effect that the purposes of the fair are compromised by the very presence of these people. 
    What is claimed, rather, is that if they engage in certain kinds of excessive or abusive behavior, which incidentally has not been found here... there are simply some unverified complaints and four signed complaints... if they engage in that kind of behavior, or if they blocked entranceways or get in the way of certain queues and lines, that they then may pose an administrative problem.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, that's... certainly, Mr. Justice. 
    And the only kind of deference that I would suggest even remotely to that court's decision in this case is that its proximity to the situation and its sensitivity to the purposes that the State of Minnesota seeks to advance are at least as likely to be reflected in its judgment as this Court indicated was true in Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, not long ago, when deference was to the Supreme Court of California where that Court had upheld rather than struck down a law of the state that seemed appropriate. 
    We simply suggest that if the Supreme Court of Minnesota sees no difficulty with less restrictive modes of achieving the state's goals and if the Attorney General of Minnesota doesn't indicate that this state fair is somehow more like the Supreme Court of the United States than like the fairs of early America and of Europe, that there is no reason for the Court to view the case in other than the context of a conventional public forum.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    They can be heard and seen, but that's an important, I think, additional point, and that is, we suggested that the primary operation of the booth rule, since it's so obviously overbroad and imprecise with respect to the goals of fraud, safety, congestion, and the like, is to limit distribution and receipt of religious literature and solicitation and the making of religious contributions, to those people who already know about, feel some sympathy toward, and are willing to be publicly associated with the very kinds of groups that are going to need most to engage in a kind of outreach program. 
    And the response of the Attorney General of Minnesota to the suggestion that people might actually feel stigmatized at going over to and publicly indicating interest in the Hare Krishnas, was interesting. 
    Their response is that it's preposterous to suppose any such thing, page 15 of their brief; that alleged fear, they say, does not seem to prevent fairgoers from going to the carnival freak shows and similar attractions. 
    That is, they are comparing those who assert fundamental First Amendment rights to freak shows.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, because... I don't think it is clear, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    The reason I don't is that just as this Court in Primus thought that a representation by the Attorney General was not necessarily conclusive on the point when the rule itself is vague, so, too, here, if someone were to walk around and say, devotion to Krishna Consciousness means sacrifice of the material things to which you are enslaved, and that's where you can give money, it would not at all surprise me if that were to be regarded as solicitation. 
    But I think there is a dilemma here. 
    Because if that is not a forbidden form of solicitation, then we fail to understand any conceivable purpose that can be served by banning solicitation and not banning that kind of advocacy.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    It says it's forbidden. 
    Soliciting, by which it is clear is meant soliciting for contributions, is forbidden in the fairgrounds outside a booth, and the entire disagreement between the majority and the dissent below is whether that is too broad. 
    But even if one were to look at a much narrower rule that says, it's okay to solicit contributions as long as the ultimate donation is made at the booth. 
    Nothing has been shown here to justify that. 
    There is speculation, surely not meeting this Court's standard in Thomas v. Indiana Review Board, that maybe there'd be some confusion if money were to change hands in the middle of a fair. 
    Well, I find that preposterous. 
    The idea that it would be confusing or a source of congestion for people to hand money to one another in the thoroughfares of a state fair is rather hard to believe; and moreover, the notion that it is permissible to limit donations to a religion to those people who are willing not only to make the donation but walk a mile in order to make it; that is, go all the way over to the booth and give their 25 cents or one dollar. 
    It's also incompatible with the protected nature of the right to solicit donations. 
    It's as though we were to tell an ordinary church that it couldn't pass a collection plate but could only take pledges for remote contributions.

    No, we think that the issue is one of the facial validity of this rule, and we think it would be far more pernicious to sacrifice the principle that the validity of the rule cannot be sustained by a few episodes, even if true, of misconduct, than to get involved in a sideshow of disputing those particular episodes. 
    But I simply point out that it's not as though we have here a finding by the courts below that the organization is guilty of some kind of systematic misconduct. 
    It's not as though we have a record on the basis of which such a finding could be made, and it's not as though we have a rule that is narrowly targeted to any kind of misconduct. 
    This is not a rule which specifically forbids particular kinds of abusive behavior.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    But the distinction this Court drew in Village of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment between the category of activities as applied to which the 75 percent rule in that case was unconstitutional, and other kinds of activities, raising money for more conventional charities unconnected with advocacy as to which it might not be unconstitutional, is exactly the same kind of distinction as the one we seek to draw here. 
    That is, just as this Court in the pair of cases represented by Martin v. Struthers and Breard v. Alexandria, suggested that it's permissible to forbid door to door distribution of purely commercial material but not permissible to do so with respect to religion and politics, so that kind of a distinction, we think, is vital here.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, I suppose the answer is that we are arguing that whether or not all of the activity in which respondents have engaged and seek to engage come within the protected core, we are entitled to have the rule struck down insofar as its enforcement against us with respect to the proposed activities is contemplated. 
    In that sense, even though clearly we are not among the many other organizations whose rights we would seek to champion, and even though we are not, as perhaps the Citizens for a Better Environment was in the Schaumberg case, in the troublesome position of not even being able to plausibly claim, or at least not being able convincingly to show that we are likely to be in the core, we are not invoking overbreadth out of necessity, but it's not a gratuitous invocation because we do think it important to explain why all of the allegations about possible misconduct are irrelevant. 
    They're irrelevant because the claim made here is that it would not be constitutional to apply the booth rule to prevent the activities that we in out complaint sought to engage in.

   Rebuttal of Kent G. Harbison

    Mr. Kent G. Harbison 
    I'd like to take up, may it please the Court, on that very point. 
    Under Minnesota statutes, every law in Minnesota is severable unless it's expressly provided not to be. 
    Furthermore, the comment that the Minnesota Supreme Court suggested some lesser restrictive alternatives to the rule has to be taken with the understanding that their decision was based upon the assumption that they were dealing only with one organization, not with potentially 30, 40, 50, 100, whatever it might be. 
    I suggest that in light of the fact that they found substantial public purposes furthered by the rule, they would have concluded very likely that in a different way, because their allegedly less restrictive alternatives would not fit in the same context. 
    So the basis for those alternatives is no longer there. 
    Without the booth rule I'm suggesting that the entire nature of the state fair would be changed drastically and that's one of the factors this Court has typically looked at, the nature of the forum here. 
    And I'd like to emphasize that the event of the annual state fair is not on the same plane, it's not the same as a public park or a public street corner.

    In the stipulation, the rule is quoted and it refers to
