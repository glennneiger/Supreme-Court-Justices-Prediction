    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    The resolution to the question post by this case, which is of constitutional dimension and I believe one of the first impression is bound to carry implications and give directions far beyond the boundaries of this case. 
    And that simple question as I view it is this. 
    Where a defendant in a criminal case makes out a prima facie case of selective prosecution, is it sufficient for the prosecutor to simply deny those allegations and suggest or intimate that this was a test case? 
    We --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Fahringer, might I interrupt you for a moment? 
    I realized that you're just beginning. 
    But as you are undoubtedly aware, our jurisdiction over appeals from or certiorari from these highest courts of States is governed by 28 U.S.C. 1257, which requires a final judgment or decree. 
    As I understand the Supreme Court of Ohio opinion here, it simply remanded the case for trial. 
    It didn't affirm a conviction. 
    Your client has never been tried. 
    Why is this a final judgment or -- or decree?

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, I believe under that section, and I'm -- I'm not sure this is a final judgment or decree, but under that Section, you've invoked your power in First Amendment cases which this is as the Government acknowledges in their brief on a number of occasions because of the importance of the issue. 
    We believe in view of the controversy that has been generated by this case, it will be well now to resolve this issue because of its widespread importance. 
    And I believe --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    I -- I think you have in the past done that, in a number of cases involving injunctions and matters of that kind, which I believe this we come well within the reach of those cases and -- and I would -- I would beseech you to invoke your jurisdiction under that inherent power you have because of the importance of the issue.

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Your Honor, I just am of the view that the -- this case is relied upon in the amicus brief where they indicate you have done this before whether it has not been a final judgment is -- is -- we are a good candidate for -- for that type of disposition. 
    The facts can be introduced to the Court in rather summary fashion. 
    I know you're aware of them but I'd like to just simply highlight in the hearing conducted in Cleveland. 
    We established and it is conceited by all that Hustler Magazine was the only magazine prosecuted although there were many other magazines similar to it, comparable to it, and in one point, the prosecution even conceited more explicit than Hustler. 
    We also established that at least, at the very least, the investigation was launched because of a political cartoon which disparaged the President of the United States and a member of his Cabinet and Governor Rockefeller. 
    And at the very most, the prosecutor conceited during the hearing that it was one of the reasons why the prosecution was initiated even though he said later on that upon examination of the magazine --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    On the -- on the practical side of the things, Mr. Fahringer, what does a prosecutor do when he's going to test the statute? 
    Does he pick out the weakest case insight or the strongest -- the strongest defendant or the most vulnerable defendant?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="237.178" stopTime="239.189">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Absolutely not. 
    He would pick the strongest, Your Honor.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Certainly, the most vulnerable defendant.

    I don't believe you are, Your Honor. 
    If we were bound by anything in this case, it would seem to me and then we urge it in the second branch of our brief that you are bound by the -- the trial judge's findings. 
    The Ohio Law is well-established that great weight is given to his time.

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, I believe the judge who hears the witnesses, observes the witnesses, has been in the past been given great deference on fact finding issues. 
    And all I'm suggesting to Your Honors in this case where he heard the witnesses testify and was present and was able to observe their demeanor, he is in a better position to judge the credibility.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="291.817" stopTime="304.819">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    I -- I don't believe you're obliged to, Your Honor. 
    I believe you have the power to go to the trial court where the credibility issues were determined. 
    Judge Brown in his dissent, I believe, makes out a very persuasive case sighting a -- a whole regime of cases in Ohio.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="317.621" stopTime="321.999">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but the very fact that he was in dissent means that the majority didn't -- didn't agree with them.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="321.999" stopTime="351.239">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    No question about it, Your Honor. 
    Well, I'm impressed by with -- with Judge Brown is the authorities that he assembled in his dissent from the highest court of Ohio indicating that we have traditionally in the State on matters of credibility given weight to the trial judge's disposition because of his unique position to make that judgment. 
    But, Your Honor, I really don't believe in a sense this case, you know, has go off on that issue. 
    It seems to me that we clearly made out a prima facie case here no matter how you examine these facts.

    What is your federal constitutional claim?

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Our federal constitutional claim is we've been denied equal protection here under the Fourteenth Amendment because we were -- we were singled out --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="363.658" stopTime="365.532">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It is in the matter of due process.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="365.532" stopTime="387.132">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, I think it is in terms of the burden of proof as a matter of due process, Your Honor. 
    I think the two rights coincide. 
    Our substantive right is one of equal protection. 
    Our due process claim is, whether or not when the Supreme Court of Ohio says, after having made out the case we did in the lower court that we were obliged to bring forward the officials to show that they were or were not going to prosecute the other magazines.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="387.132" stopTime="398.362">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They have had some equal protection cases where we've -- in the name of making a constitutional judgment with -- made our own judgment of the historical facts?

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, what I think we have is, we have a long line of cases from this Court where you have given great weight to the findings of --

    Well, I think the same --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="411.061" stopTime="414.270">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This just comes from -- this comes from the state court as Justice Rehnquist said.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="414.270" stopTime="423.336">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, forgive me but I don't believe there should be any difference in this Court in judging the fact finding process of the District Court or of a state trial court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="423.336" stopTime="438.643">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Congress may have suggested that there should be. 
    I mean -- all we can review of the -- in state court proceedings is questions of violations of federal or constitutional right.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="438.643" stopTime="512.004">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, let me -- let me just say this. 
    Depending on your disposition on that issue, my view is that the wrong rule was applied here and -- and I'd like to address that. 
    It seems to me when you have a case of this kind where a monopoly of the evidence exists with the Government as in the prosecutorial vindictiveness in these cases and in the exclusion of cognizable minority groups from juries, this Court has set, dealing both with State cases and with federal cases that a different rule has to be applied. 
    Obviously, in these cases, the defendant displaced at a distinct disadvantage in terms of trying to -- we never had any expectation for one moment in this case that my cross-examination would cause Mr. Tailor to break down and say, “Yes. 
    Yes. 
    I did it.” 
    This was a selective prosecution. 
    In every case, it has come to this Court or has come to these Circuit Courts under selective prosecution, it is understandable that the prosecutor who bears the responsibility for this act has taken a defensive posture and has explained a way the reason if it seems to me if -- if this case were to survive every single selective prosecution case in the country could be defeated by the prosecutor saying, well this, we decided this was a test case. 
    (Voice Overlap)
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="512.004" stopTime="517.025">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is it possible to have a test case that's not selective?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="517.025" stopTime="558.191">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Of course, Your Honor, of course. 
    As a matter of fact, I welcomed that question in Atlanta, Georgia, and the case decided in the prosecutor's brief where they did exactly the same thing. 
    They made a judgment in Atlanta, Georgia. 
    This case reached the Fifth Circuit. 
    They made out a judgment that they were going to proceed against the so-called “sophisticated men's magazines” to put it as gracefully as I can. 
    And there, they -- they went after five or six and many of those, Your Honor, were out of State, a -- a matter of fact, they were all out of State. 
    They were going to use their expedition powers to bring all those of publishers into the State and they prosecuted Penthouse, they prosecuted Hustler, they prosecuted Playboy, they prosecuted Club Magazine and a number of others.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="558.191" stopTime="566.929">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Yes.

speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="570.052" stopTime="573.096">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Absolutely. 
    There's no question about it, Your Honor, and what I --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What's wrong with it?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="574.190" stopTime="612.850">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, what is wrong with it is here, Your Honor, I think it is inherently a suspect. 
    Let's look at the facts. 
    They acknowledge -- the prosecutor acknowledges that he stated on public television that this case is being prosecuted because of political cartoon. 
    We know that the -- the initial investigation was launched by the cartoon because of complaints that were made against it. 
    Now, it seems to me more than coincidental, at that point after Hustler has been in that community for two years, they've had 550 obscenity prosecution, not one has ever involved the sophisticated men's magazine. 
    And all of a sudden, coincidentally with that, they make a judgment that we are going to proceed against Hustler on obscenity ground.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="612.850" stopTime="623.136">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you -- are you suggesting that by putting one political cartoon in another lies pornographic publication. 
    The -- the publisher insulates himself from prosecution under the First Amendment?

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Absolutely not, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="624.132" stopTime="627.058">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, then, what's the significance of the political cartoon that you mentioned?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="627.058" stopTime="630.256">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Because that's what inspired the prosecution, Your Honor, I say in all difference to the --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="630.256" stopTime="635.189">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's what -- did the highest court of Ohio say something about that?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="635.189" stopTime="642.383">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    No, Your Honor. 
    They -- they -- what the highest court of Ohio said was this, “It is conceited that Hustler was selected.” 
    So, under the two --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="642.383" stopTime="656.638">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Of course as Justice Marshall had suggested, the prosecutor always selects and -- and you have conceited that if he knows what his business, he's going to select the strongest case for the prosecution and the most vulnerable defendant.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="656.638" stopTime="681.474">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    What I -- what -- Your Honor, I welcome that question because I think that goes to the very heart of the issue here, and let me deal with it. 
    It seems to me under the well-established law, we have to satisfy two branches of the test that's been fixed by this Court and other courts. 
    One is, that we've been singled out and all I'm saying is that that's been conceited by everyone because they didn't prosecute any other magazines. 
    Now, the -- the hard part of the case is, did they single us out for an impermissible reason? 
    We have prima facie --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="681.474" stopTime="682.718">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What's the impermissible reason?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="682.718" stopTime="683.735">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    The cartoon.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="683.735" stopTime="692.154">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, then -- then we come back to the proposition that by putting one political cartoon, the publisher is going to be insulated from prosecution?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="692.154" stopTime="727.052">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    No, no, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that. 
    And let me try to make myself clear to you. 
    I'm not saying that the magazine can be salvaged on obscenity grounds because of that cartoon. 
    What I'm saying is, where it is clear from the evidence that the pros -- at least the investigation was initiated by that cartoon, this Court has to take a hard look at a -- a retraction of that. 
    And at the hearing when obviously, you have an issue now in an adversary forum where the prosecutor comes in and says, “Well, that really wasn't our reason that we decided to make a test case of this.” 
    The other thing I would urge upon this Court is otherwise, it seems to me the doctrine of selective prosecution would become a myth.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Fahringer, what in your opinion, if you had to pick one case from this Court on the question of selective prosecution, is the closest one that supports you?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="737.014" stopTime="741.611">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, I would like to answer that question by saying that the rule that I would like --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="741.611" stopTime="743.947">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No, I'm not -- I asked you with the case.

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    I'm sorry. 
    I was going to do that. 
    I think the fourth case out of the Seventh Circuit --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="747.277" stopTime="749.695">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I -- from this Court, I asked.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="749.695" stopTime="847.447">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Judge, there is no case indirectly in point in this Court. 
    What you have done is in this Court under Yick Wo, Oiler, and two guys, you have a established the substantive rules. 
    Now, I didn't mean to evade your question. 
    What I'm saying is that you have never addressed what I consider to be the primary issue of the procedure, the implementing of the rule. 
    After you announced the rule in exclusion of cognizable groups of minorities, you had a substantive principle. 
    In Castaneda, you then had to decide how are we going to implicate this because what had happened is, jury commissioners were coming in to the Courts and saying, “We never had any intent to exclude Mexicans or -- or Blacks.” 
    And in -- what I consider to be a critically important footnote in Castaneda, Footnote number 19, the Court said and -- and the language is important enough that I just recited to you, it's very short. 
    What you said is -- this is not to say of course to the simple protest station from a commissioner that racial considerations played no part and the selection would be enough. 
    This kind of testimony has been found insufficient in several cases. 
    Neither is the State entitled to a -- to rely on a presumption that officials discharge their sworn duties to rebut the case of discrimination. 
    There you have in that instance, plaintiffs, who have shown a discrimination against a -- a cognizable minority group. 
    The commissioners come in just like the -- the U.S. attorney of the -- the prosecutor does here and says, “We never intended that and that it's not our purpose to -- to -- to discriminate against Mexicans.” 
    And this Court has said that because of the unique circumstances of those cases, we are going to require a heavier burden of proof and they will have to produce more. 
    In Blackledge versus Perry, and -- and, Your Honor, perhaps I should have responded by --

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, You Honor, it would be selective but it might be justifiable. 
    In other words, they may not have used an impermissible standard. 
    What I'm suggesting in this case, and I wanted to reach this with the Court because I think it's terribly important, you understand that what we are faced here in this case, which I think presents a terrible threat to the whole doctrine of selective prosecution, is a situation without one single bit of corroborative evidence, without any criteria at all, without any suggestion that we had a meeting, and we decided to go against Hustler, without any proof that we collected other magazines and then we made a decision that Hustler was the worst magazine, without a memorandum, without a report or anything after this claim was brought, and after Hustler is the only magazine a prosecutor simply takes the stand, and I hope my comments don't lack diplomacy, but I -- I would be a coward if I didn't say this, a prosecutor takes the stand and simply says, “ Well, you never incidentally, never in the hearing does he utter the word 'test case'.” 
    What he says is, “We were considering maybe going after the other magazines once the Hustler prosecution was concluded.” 
    Now, you may find what that implies, he's talking about a test case. 
    But I come back to this issue and -- and I -- I challenge that the -- my -- my brothers to answers this. 
    If this were the law in the context of this case right now, would you all agree with me that any selective prosecution claim could be defeated? 
    Could be defeated by simply a prosecutor taking the stand and saying, “This is a test case”?

    Well, I think, Your Honor, I was going to -- in response to Judge Rehnquist's question, the case of Blackledge versus Perry, which is a prosecutorial vindictiveness case is in the close neighborhood of what we're talking about here. 
    And the Court there said, “This Court went further than the Circuits did in Falk, Steel, Crowders and Burrows by holding that due process is violated where there is prosecutorial opportunity for vindictiveness, even when there is no evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad faith, or maliciously. 
    What I'm urging by analogy is, in a very close situation where you have prosecutorial vindictiveness rather than selectivity, and I see them closely aligned, this Court recognizing the difficult of -- difficulty of proof that the defendant has says, In those cases, if there's appearance of vindictiveness, and opportunity for vindictiveness, then a very -- heavy burden shifts to the Government, to come forward.

    Well, Your Honor, I -- I just am -- I'm critical of the fashion which the -- I think, Your Honor, rightly or wrongly, that these procedures represent a very real threat to the First Amendment. 
    I -- I -- it's a matter of record, Your Honor, that the minute this prosecution was initiated against Mr. Flynt, the major distributor in that community would not longer handle those magazines. 
    The prosecutor wrote him and said, “We are considering, starting a criminal action against him, and if we do, will you discontinue handling this magazine?” 
    And he said, “Yes.” 
    And so the minute the action was started, George Klein, the major distributor in Cleveland, no longer handled it. 
    This Court has always been extremely sensitive to the chilling effect of prosecutions of this kind which involve the distribution of magazines which are presumably protected. 
    As a matter of fact, I don't know why the unbroken series of cases that stretched over the long history of this Court that have always held postulate that where you have a restraint, a prior restraint of the nature you have here that comes to this court, it comes bearing a presumption of unconstitutionality.

    Now, for some reason, the Supreme Court -- and I -- I consider this terribly important procedurally, the Supreme Court said the reason we failed in making out our prima facie case is that we should have brought those persons in from the prosecutor's office and put them on the stand and inquired of them.

speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="1520.693" stopTime="1571.780">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    -- because as they concede on their brief, they were mistaken when they said they couldn't bring people in from out of state. 
    The extradition law, as a matter of fact, Section -- I believe it is 23 -- 2903 of the State of Ohio law says that -- 29-6301 through 29-6329 provides that they can extradite for misdemeanors. 
    So that, he was mistaken in that -- in that assumption, so he could have gone after all of the sophisticated men's magazine and brought all of the people in from out-of-state. 
    But Your Honor, the point I make is, it seems to me the very least we're entitled to is some corroboration of a meaning, of a discussion about evaluating these other magazines and the purchase of those magazines, the police officers went out and got Penthouse these other magazines, brought them in; and they had said, “We made a decision that Hustler is the magazine we're going to go after,” then it would seem to me that they may well admit their burden.

    I don't think, Your Honor, in this area where you are involve both of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, that it makes any difference whether we're in a federal jurisdiction or in a state jurisdiction. 
    I would see this Court handing down a rule that would govern selective prosecution, both in state courts and in federal courts. 
    My time is about to expire, but let me just end this note at the risk of being repetitive. 
    I think the -- the matter of the Court should be the most concerned about is, if this selective prosecution were to be sustained on the record is below, then it seems to me we will have done irreparable damage to that doctrine if it is to survive and remain viable. 
    Because basically, what could happen in any selective prosecution across the country, a prosecutor could simply come in and say,” One, we never intended to discriminate against this defendant. 
    We may go after some of the other defendants later on.And number three, we view this as test case.” 
    If that's the situation, then we run a terrible risk of every single selective prosecution being defeated and that the doctrine would be relegated to a legal museum. 
    Thank you very much. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Bruce A. Taylor
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1685.146" stopTime="1687.817">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Taylor.
speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="1687.817" stopTime="1801.682">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I first would like to make a comment on jurisdiction. 
    Although usually the state prosecutors who appear in the federal courts whether it be this Court or district courts, commonly 1983 actions, the state is usually in reluctance to submit to federal jurisdiction. 
    However, I think that the procedural aspect of this case makes it different than other types of cases where this Court has determined whether or not the finality rule is subject to an exception bringing a case up here that is interlocutory in nature or whether there are further procedures which can be happening in the lower court on remand. 
    The difference is that in this case, we have a prosecutor's appeal. 
    We have brought Larry Flynt and his brother and his wife here against their will, as it were. 
    There should be a distinction made by this Court in determining jurisdiction between cases where the prosecutor loses in the Trial Court on his motion to dismiss for selective prosecution as it is in double jeopardy. 
    On the contrary, the cases where the defendant wins his motion and the prosecutor appeals, his -- the prosecutor has the right to appeal by statute in Ohio. 
    We have to ask leave of court from the Court of Appeals and then it can go further to the supreme court of the state. 
    One of the requirements of 1257 is at it be that the -- a final of judgment or decree of the highest court of the State. 
    Therefore, when you talk about a final decree, the Supreme Court of Ohio, has in effect, taken a ruling which in a trial court level applied only to Larry Flynt and his brother and his wife, and has broadened it into a statewide policy, cementing in stone the rule of law in Ohio as the Supreme Court of Ohio cedes your decisions on selective enforcement. 
    They have, in effect, made it for everybody.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If this case goes to trial and the defendant is convicted, you're not suggesting that is -- that under Ohio law, he can't present on appeal to the Court of Appeals?

speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2094.349" stopTime="2095.063">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2095.063" stopTime="2097.791">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, but it's been decided in this case by the Supreme Court of Ohio.
speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2097.791" stopTime="2106.576">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Yes, and that's why your case is dealing with kind of making judicial economy, and that kind of thing, cutting down ways would decide that issue now. 
    The other thing --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2106.576" stopTime="2125.723">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if even though the Supreme Court of Ohio were to adhere to it's previous ruling, as is what we expected to do, opposing the counsel, that's certainly preserved the point, and again petition for certiorari with a final judgment, if he is convicted.
speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2125.723" stopTime="2187.064">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 
    And that's what I mean, Cox and the cases, I think, you know, notwithstanding the -- the way you arrived that and have carved out a situation which I find myself in. 
    And what I meant to ask the Court is that you take note that by saying that you can supervise early, decide whether the Supreme Court of Ohio correctly announced the law and that should not be construed by this Court or Other courts -- then that gives a defendant a correlative right to a pretrial collateral appeal if he loses his motion to dismiss. 
    And if the trial judge says, “No, you have to stand trial because you were not selectively enforced,” that should not give rise to an appeal by him before trial, such as it was just decided by the Ninth Circuit in the U.S. versus Wilson case just last month. 
    And the U.S. Ninth Circuit has extended this Court's decision in Abney which said that double jeopardy is a pretrial appeal to vindictive prosecutions. 
    And now, they've said vindictive prosecutions are the same as selective prosection. 
    And I think that this Court should be wary of the distinction, and that's the only point I meant to make on jurisdiction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2187.064" stopTime="2196.590">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, didn't -- didn't we on McDonald say that speedy trail claims were not governed even within the federal system by Abney?
speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2196.590" stopTime="2364.277">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Yes, and I think that we are close to that. 
    A defendant losing his motion at trial is governed by that case rather than Abney. 
    Abney was decided because of the peculiarity of the double jeopardy history and because of the significance of that claim. 
    I don't think selective prosecution or vindictive prosecution or -- or losing any evidence question or motion to suppress should be allowed given the defendant's right to a pretrial appeal.But since that could be -- if the Court is going to deal with jurisdiction, I wish that it take a distinction between when a prosecutor has the right to appeal and you are merely supervising whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio made the correct decision, and one where you're saying all selective prosecution cases have -- give rise to a direct appeal or right of certiorari grant. 
    Now, as far as the merits of the case which is, I think, the allegations before us, the motive of the prosecutor, I think, is -- is important when it's clear on the facts of the record that the prosecutor is vindictive. 
    If the prosecutor in Cameron versus Johnson for instance had enforce the new anti-picketing statute that was passed while the people were picketing the court house and he had picked out the guy to be arrested, he'd sent the cops after the guy that wasn't the leader, then I think he'd have been in trouble. 
    But since he -- they passed the new ordinance and statute and he enforced it, generally, this Court said, “Well it's a new statute, we've got to test it. 
    And you can't say that it's invidious until you have a course of conduct.” 
    I think that the course of conduct requirements, were this court has said that you must prove that something happens over and over again are important because as this court stated in Sunday Lake Iron, which is a good example of a selective prosecution case, practically, uniformity is the aim of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    And the emphasis, I think, is impractical. 
    And I think that the issue on this case is important to us because there are two types of crimes that we must deal within the cities now. 
    Those are the cases that come to us and we have no discretion to deny or to prosecute. 
    Murders or robberies or assault, those kinds of crimes which happen, and then there are people arrested, we have to take those cases. 
    The cases we have to martial our resources and decide what to with are what we call ”discretionary cases”, you know, the organized criminal activity that's ongoing, everybody knows about it, it's flagrantly done like I'd said, any prostitution, gambling, white collar crime, those kinds of things. 
    Where you know there's people violating the law and you have to decide what to do about it. 
    At this point in our history, obscenity crimes have become such a multi-million-dollar industry that they in, in effect, have more money than we do. 
    And as he pointed out, there could be 50 magazines, 50 magazines capable of defending a lawsuit that the City of Cleveland could bring, who has -- had one assistant prosecutor, who also -- even though I did obscenity cases, and they all were mine, I also did all the negligent homicides and I did 2,000 other cases.

speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2377.862" stopTime="2410.653">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Your Honor, we did it once with the Hustler case because we -- after we charged Hustler, we were afraid that Hustler would start, you know, publishing more stuff about this case. 
    And we figured that we could test it, not only criminally but civilly, to get a judge in effect in a common pleas court to agree that it's obscene, that would kind of help our case and it would make publicity and the juries would know about it. 
    And obviously, we would be able to somewhat gauge the waters before the trial and whether or not a judge was going to agree to us that this magazine was obscene before we were going to go through a trial.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2410.653" stopTime="2427.803">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, as a prosecutor making the choice or considering the choice between a civil injunction suit under criminal prosecution, would you take into an account the rather stringent additive this Court has expressed on the prior restraint of publications?
speaker="bruce_a_taylor" startTime="2427.803" stopTime="2467.897">
    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Well, yes. 
    And the reason is that, an injunction statute, to answer both questions, is very impractical. 
    It's useless for magazine cases. 
    It's okay for film cases, but only the kinds of film cases which you're going to play for a month. 
    If Deep Throat comes to Cleveland, they're going to want to show it a long time to get their money back. 
    Well, if you got an injunction after seven or ten days, that would have some effect. 
    But the peep shows where you put a quarter in and see a movie and there's 14 movie projectors in a booth, or magazine rack where every single month, 50 different issues comes out. 
    Well, getting an injunction ten days later on one magazine is not going to do any good, they can bring a truckload in and replace it. 
    So as a practical matter, nobody in this country is prosecuting magazines under the civil injunction statute because it doesn't have any (Voice Overlap) presidential effect.

    We filed it in the Court of Common Pleas and we had a discussion on discriminatory prosecution.

    They just let it lie.

    This trial judge, he didn't say that. 
    What the trial judge said was that “I understand that this -- I won't take cognizance that this is the first case, but I -- I must look to see that it's the only case. 
    And therefore a -- a single case in impermissible.” He was on the view that there's no such thing as a test case, and that it really does not matter if there is a good reason for having one case or a bad reason. 
    He thought that, you know, selective prosecution was a question of numbers, and he says so in his opinion. 
    “I'm only concerned with whether not it's the only case on the docket. 
    And since it is, I have to dismiss it.” 
    He did it reluctantly and Judge Calandra is one of the two judges on that court that has held the vast majority of our trials in these cases. 
    And rather than dismissing them or granting motion to suppress, so he -- he's ruling, he more or less blamed it on me in his decision, saying that you know, “You have should done --

    Mr. Bruce A. Taylor 
    Yes. 
    And that's one of the things, not only did they say, “Here's the law on selective prosecution, go back to the trial court and apply it.” 
    They said -- in effect, they decided the factual issue, “Yes, this is not a prima facie case, the prosecutor did not discriminate. 
    He did have a valid test case.” 
    And I think that this Court is bound by that portion of the Supreme Court of Ohio's ruling. 
    In cases like Ward versus Illinois and Michigan versus New York and some other cases, this Court has said you are bound by decisions of the State Court unless clearly, you're erroneous or violative of some other provision of the constitution. 
    I think that what this Court should -- could zero in on is whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio announced the proper rule of law, because that is a general pronouncement in Ohio. 
    But whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio correctly reviewed the facts, they really didn't, they affirmed the Court of Appeals who reviewed the facts. 
    And in Ohio, the Court of Appeals is the last court which can review the facts and the evidence.

   Argument of Andrew J. Levander
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2819.539" stopTime="2822.486">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Levander?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2822.486" stopTime="2976.402">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.I would like primarily to address the merits of petitioner's selective prosecution claim. 
    But as I pointed out in our amicus curiae brief, we believe that the Court lacks jurisdiction under Section 1257 to hear this case. 
    This case is different than Cox Broadcasting and some other cases, this cases falls into this morning's decision at San Diego Electric and the long line of cases including Albas, Republic Gas Company, Radio Station WOW, Cox Broadcasting. 
    Dictum would say that where there are other federal issues pending to be determined on the remand, then it would highly inappropriate for this Court to take jurisdiction of the case which could come back again after all the federal issues have been decided. 
    As been pointed out in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's comments, the decision below, the trial will produce other federal questions if petitioners are convictive. 
    Of course if they are acquitted, this Court would never have to reach the selective prosecution claim. 
    And for those reasons, we believe that the -- that the decision is not final, within the meaning of 1257. 
    Now, I would like to make one other point, or two other points. 
    First, some of the decisions like Cox Broadcasting and Miami Herald, which have stretched the concept of finality to some extent have done so on the basis, I think, that was pressing First Amendment issue which affect a lot of the press as a whole and the public as a whole, and there were really no other federal issues to be decided. 
    And therefore, it wasn't imperative that the decision be made at that time. 
    A selective prosecution claimant, a petitioner of selective prosecution claim is, by definition, very different. 
    It only affects a historical fact in these petitioners, by definition, is not affecting the other members of the press because under their claim, the State of Ohio has failed to prosecute under members of the press. 
    Therefore it seems, you know, completely inappropriate for the Court to try to spread some jurisdictional provisions, and I think that the Court should dismiss the writ. 
    My brother did point out one other matter of great concern on the jurisdiction was to us, and that is the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in Wilson. 
    That decision held that a district court's denial of a selective prosecution claim while at trial was immediately appealable by the defendant. 
    Now, that is going to cause havoc with the criminal justice system because any defendant could come in and make a selective prosecution claim. 
    And if he's denied at hearing or he's denied on the merits, then he can simply take an appeal, it's much different than Abney double jeopardy claims, also the Equal Protection Clauses I have at history --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2976.402" stopTime="2979.314">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is the Government going to try to bring Wilson here?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2979.314" stopTime="3072.935">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, he can't, Your Honor, because we prevailed on the merits in the case after they reached the -- so -- but in deciding this jurisdictional issue, I urge the Court to be very aware of this problem. 
    And -- and if the Court would like, we'd be willing to submit a post-argument brief in short order on this point if it would be any use to the Court. 
    Turning to the merits, the trial court held as a matter law that where there is a test case, where there is one defendant among similarly situated other defendants and a prosecution of law only against the one, but that is legally insufficient, there were not factual findings as -- as the Ohio Supreme Court noted on the footnote at the end of it's opinion. 
    There -- there were no factual findings by the trial court about bad faith, bad motives, cartoons, anything. 
    It simply stated that it was legally insufficient to have a test case. 
    Now, my brother Mr. Fahringer has sort of waffled in his point this morning, but in his reply writ at page five, he concedes now begrudgingly that a test case is an appropriate as prosecutorial stratagem. 
    That concession is well warranted in light of this decision -- this Court's decisions on Mackay Telegraph, Moog Industries and Universal-Rundle Corp, which were all cited in the briefs, as well as many other cases. 
    Where there are just numerous defendants similarly situated and the prosecutor lacks resources to prosecute all, or where the law is at some question whether there is -- whether the laws can be applied to a particular kind of situation or particular kind of defendant.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3072.935" stopTime="3078.888">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That situation, could he select his defendant because of the cartoon he published? 
    What is your view on that?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3078.888" stopTime="3082.179">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    No, I think he could select him randomly, and the courts have so held.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    He could not do it. 
    He could select --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3085.708" stopTime="3087.113">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You would agree he could not do that?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3087.113" stopTime="3094.890">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    If the cartoon is constitutionally protected and he was doing because he was punishing for an exercise of constitutional right, we would agree that would be inappropriate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3094.890" stopTime="3096.182">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's not the question.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3096.182" stopTime="3119.341">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That's not the question here. 
    Because here, it seems to me that the evidence is unequivocal as to what happenned. 
    There were complaints made about the July Hustler issue, some of those complaints focused on the cartoon, some of them focused on the magazine as a whole. 
    But even assuming that every complaint focused on the cartoon and that spurred an investigation, it is not -- it's simply irrelevant in an equal protection case (Voice Overlap)
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3119.341" stopTime="3131.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Let me ask you one other question. 
    Let's assume that it was not the sole reason but that the only disguising factor from all other magazines, and it was one of the reasons, would that be permissible?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3131.176" stopTime="3132.192">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    I believe it would be if --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3132.192" stopTime="3136.286">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It would be if it was one of reason. 
    But it always has some other reason, why then, it's a -- it's a test case.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3136.286" stopTime="3212.457">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That's exactly right. 
    And in the -- in the Court's equal protection cases, Mt.Healthy against Doyle, Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in Bakke, in Arlington Heights footnote 21, the Court has repeatedly stated that “where in an equal protection case, the moving party, here the petitioners, have established that invidious or discriminate, intentionally discriminatory reason is the motivating cause for a particular kind of state action,” -- and we don't have that here, we have -- did not establish that -- “Then the burden shifts to the state to show that the invidious factors not the “but for” cause.” 
    So that is -- that is the test. 
    Here, we don't -- I don't believe that we get to the “but for” problem. 
    If we do, I think that the prosecutor's testimony at the hearing overwhelmingly shows that the decision to prosecute was made on various rational factors, including his view that Hustler has more obscene, the fact that was a more notorious violator of the law, the fact that was in-state and even if you could get extradition over these other out-of-state publishers, there was no need for Cleveland to expend that additional money in bringing a test case to pick the most difficult to prosecute. 
    As the Chief had said earlier today, he can pick the strongest case and he can pick the easiest case for himself, that's entirely appropriate.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, if he -- then the question goes to me --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Say there's ten ad he's going to pick one, and he said, “Well, they're all absolutely equal they're all be valid prosecutions, I'm going to pick the one I like the least.”
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3231.588" stopTime="3235.670">

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, certainly, where he --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Or what if he had to pick the one that he has the dad most protests about.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="3241.345" stopTime="3272.629">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That is entirely appropriate because it's an aim of the criminal law not only to punish, but to deter. 
    And in so -- insofar as the particular defendant has the most notoriety and therefore the effect of a conviction will be most telling on the future compliance, certainly picking out the most notorious offender is perfectly appropriate. 
    And in certain cases like tax cases, for example, where there's a protester who has willfully violated the laws, his public statements will facilitate the prosecution.

    The hearing did show however, quite conclusively, that this prosecution was perfectly permissible and rationally chosen. 
    And we think that more difficult cases, you know, might arise, this is certainly not one of those cases. 
    The other point that I would like to make about the -- that the cartoon, if, Justice Stevens, you were right that insofar as the prosecution was based that all in the cartoon, that it would be an impermissible prosecution, then anytime you had a complaining witness who brought, I see my time -- okay, this is --

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Thank you. 
    Anytime you had a complaining witness who believed or brought the -- the crimes to the notice of the police because they didn't like the defendant, let's assume it's a drug pusher or -- or a bank robber, or whatever --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And this case involves a publication, let's -- let's have examples of either newspapers or magazines. 
    I'm sure the difference in armed robbery and burglary --

    Well, for --

    -- would be entirely different.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    -- for example, suppose -- suppose the -- an employee at the -- at the -- at a newspaper or not even an employee, a person who knows --

    No, that's right --

    -- that there's discrimination --

    Let's say an editorial writer, state -- give us a case involving an editorial writer.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Fine. 
    The -- the person who reports the violations of Labor Standard Act, or some other -- or tax evasion, does so, a private person, because he has a dislike for the editorial policy of a particular paper, it is invidious state action which violates the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The private motivation of the reporting party which leads the investigation is simply irrelevant. 
    And -- and therefore --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would it be irrelevant if the record were clear that there were about 200 other people just like this one that they had never prosecuted in here?

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Yes, completely relevant.

   Rebuttal of Herald Price Fahringer
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3497.213" stopTime="3500.392">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you. 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Fahringer? 
    You have two minutes remaining.

    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    (Voice Overlap) Your Honor, thank you. 
    I wanted to bring to the Court's attention, what the judge -- the trial judge said at the very end of the case. 
    "For purpose of this motion, the Court is limited by the testimony and must search that testimony objectively in relationship to the constitutional guidelines established by a series of previous judicial decisions on the discriminatory prosecution question. 
    And it is this Court's decision that the testimony supports the allegations of the defendant.” 
    So, I believe, Your Honors, that language can be interpreted albeit -- albeit a very short decision that the judge did make a finding, a fact-finding, a -- a decision that the testimony in general supported our claim.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3539.982" stopTime="3542.478">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But the -- the Supreme Court of Ohio didn't agree with them.
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="3542.478" stopTime="3543.244">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    That's true, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3543.244" stopTime="3547.094">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that's -- that's the -- that's the decision that's binding on us, isn't it?
speaker="herald_price_fahringer" startTime="3547.094" stopTime="3590.526">
    Mr. Herald Price Fahringer 
    Well, Your Honor, I would like believe -- and again, I apologize for disagreeing with you that I think when the -- in -- in the dissent when they say we have always given great weight to the -- the trier of the fact, and -- and this Court too has given great weight to the trier of the fact in the past, I think that should be done here. 
    Last, let me just say this, if it is part of the reason, if the First Amendment implications are part of the reason for prosecuting the magazine, then it seems to me there has to be a much more in-depth inquiry than we had here as to whether or not this is a test case or not. 
    Once the concession is made that it was part of the reason why we went after this magazine, then I don't think it's sufficient simply to label it a test case, but that there should be some corroboration of it being a test case. 
    Thank you.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3590.526" stopTime="3594.262">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
