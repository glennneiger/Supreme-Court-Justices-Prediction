    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    May it please the Court: 
    I have the privilege of representing First National Maintenance Corporation in an appeal which comes to you from the second circuit court. 
    The question presented for your determination is whether an employer's unilateral decision to terminate a losing portion of its operation solely for legitimate business reasons breaches the duty to bargain under Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    In this case, Your Honors, we are not dealing with anti-union motivation. 
    No animus is present. 
    Nor are we dealing with what has been stipulated and accepted as the mandatory nature of effects bargaining. 
    Nor are we dealing--

    --Effects bargaining, Your Honor. 
    Nor are we dealing with subjects which may be unlawful under the Borg-Warner concept. 
    Stated another way, therefore, Your Honor, we are here to determine whether or not terminating a losing portion of its business for a legitimate business reason is either a mandatory subject of bargaining within the National Labor Relations Act or a permissive subject of bargaining within the National Labor Relations Act.

    No, Your Honor. 
    As the record indicates depending upon the time that you look at it, during the critical period the petitioner operated either two or four facilities. 
    We had some 17 months covered by the entire period of operation in the particular facility which is affected. 
    Thirty-five employees were employed in the Greenpark facility which is the particular facility in which operations were terminated.

    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    No, Your Honor, the record does not show that. 
    The record does, however, show that there was no interchange between the various facilities serviced by First National. 
    First National, as Your Honors, I'm sure, are aware, was a service corporation which did cleaning and maintenance work in nursing homes and old age homes within the City of New York. 
    We have been fortunate in that we have had the benefit of two Supreme Court decisions in this area, one entitled Fibreboard, wherein the Supreme Court had the opportunity of affirming a decision of Mr. Chief Justice Burger who was then sitting in the circuit court, and in which Mr. Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion. 
    Thereafter, about one year later, this Court had an opportunity to examine the case in Darlington. 
    Darlington concerned a partial secession of operations and it arose under Section 3 of the National Labor Relations Act and not under Section 12. 
    I think it can be fairly stated that as we view the decisions of this Court in Fibreboard through its rationale in Darlington as interpreted by the majority of the circuits, and even, I might suggest, by the two circuits who came to different conclusions and by the National Labor Relations Board, which comes to a different conclusion at face, what seems to me to be apparent, that there evolves a concept of law which is really what I would suggest is the status of the law today. 
    And that is to require an employer to bargain about the matter which is within his entrepreneurial control would be in the permissive area as opposed to mandatory. 
    When there are replacements performing the affected work as part of an integrated work process who are still controlled by the original employer, then a change in that original work is a mandatory subject of bargaining. 
    I believe that when Fibreboard talked about subcontracting and subcontracting in terms of the employer still exercising control, and all that the employer did in Fibreboard was to replace one group of employees with another group of employees, that's what was meant: an employer replacing employees performing the affected work as part of the integrated work process, who are still controlled by the employer. 
    And Fibreboard correctly stated that that subject would have been mandatory. 
    However, if there is a secession of the work and there are no longer replacements performing that work, or if on the other hand as in Darlington the employer withdraws himself as an employer of the affected work, then in those instances I would submit the cases almost uniformly hold that the bargaining would then be permissive. 
    The hard cases, Your Honors, where the courts very often look to the possibility of taint of union animus, are really cases where the court is trying in my opinion to look to see whether there is a subterfuge, whether the employer is still becoming the employer, whether the work is really still being done by an ally or where there is really a continuation of the same employment relationship but with different employees. 
    That is not the case which is before you. 
    As I stated, the petitioner services at best four facilities in the New York area. 
    It goes into those facilities with its own employees, it cleans the facilities, it receives as compensation from the nursing home a weekly sum which is the equivalent of its out-of-pocket expenses for the payment of its own employees plus a management fee. 
    In this case the management fee should have been $500 by agreement at the beginning of the arrangement with Greenpark. 
    It was $250 when the petitioner requested Greenpark to replace it to the $500. 
    Greenpark refused and the petitioner ceased operations. 
    It left, it terminated its relationship as an employer performing that service, or, in the case of General Motors, of producing the item. 
    So I would suggest to you that when there is a true partial, or a true total closing... I'm sorry?

    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    Your Honor, it is not part of this record because the effects bargaining was stipulated to at the lower level and it was acceded by all parties that there should and is mandatory bargaining on the effects, clearly. 
    And the reason for that is because we should be looking to the policy of the Act. 
    The policy of the Act, as you know, is set forth in the Act itself. 
    It talks in terms of its policy. 
    And it says, in effect, that there is a desire to have collective bargaining, and that the parties should recognize under law each of others, one another's legitimate rights. 
    The legitimate right of an employee, I submit, is to look to the work which he has traditionally been doing for an employer and say, Mr. Employer, if you continue to do this work, if you continue to be an employer who has control of this work, then I have a legitimate right to want to continue to do it. 
    If you want to take that legitimate right away from me, then at least talk to me about it. 
    On the other hand, the legitimate right of an employer is to say, like an employee can say, I quit. 
    I don't want to work anymore. 
    An employee has a right to quit. 
    An employer has a right to withdraw himself as an employer. 
    Now that does not mean, Your Honors, that he has to withdraw himself as a total employer in every single facet of a multi-faceted operation. 
    It's only as an employer who produces a particular affected item so that, as in First National--

speaker="sanford_e_pollack" startTime="692.001" stopTime="903.198">
    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    At this point there is no privity; that is certainly correct. 
    It's been held by many, many of the circuits that employees have a right to quit a job even where an employee cannot strike. 
    Employees en masse have a right to quit. 
    So too does an employer in recognition of the entrepreneurial, core of entrepreneurial control doctrine, have a right to say he does not wish to make that kind of product. 
    If he totally excludes himself from making the product, I suggest that the dangers inherent in calling this subject a mandatory subject of bargaining, would require that he not be forced into that dilemma. 
    Once a subject is called mandatory, it brings into play disclosure of all relevant facts during the bargaining process, it brings into fact disclosure of the fact that there is a desire to terminate to the world at large. 
    That includes the employer's suppliers, the employer's creditors, key personnel of the employer, potential and possible purchasers of the business, all of which, Your Honors, works to the detriment of the employer's legitimate rights. 
    In a free enterprise society, as the majority, as the Fibreboard decision recognized, even in the majority opinion as compared to the concurring opinion, there is an inherent management freedom. 
    The concurring opinion called it the core of entrepreneurial control. 
    The National Labor Relations Board in the Ozark Trailers case, which really is probably the single most important case from the National Labor Relations Board, since it sets the framework within that Board's functions in this area, even there they recognized that to deal with the problem of partial closings they have to deal with the direct effects of the decision. 
    I suggest that the direct effect is not an incidental effect of a decision to terminate the management's desire to stay in business. 
    It is indirect to the determination made by management in the core of his entrepreneurial control, to terminate. 
    True, there is no doubt about it, that that decision does affect working conditions, but it affects them indirectly. 
    It affects them incidentally. 
    The subject is not whether the employer should terminate, but what the effects of that termination should be. 
    The desire of the respondent to deem all areas of partial closing almost on a per se basis as mandatory subjects of bargaining, really is a way of saying that they need to hold a plant hostage in order to have efficient, effective, effects bargaining.

    I think, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the word "valid" is whether there's a valid termination of employment, meaning the employer validly goes out of business. 
    He doesn't run away and open up a plant in another state in order to avoid some sort of union problem, or he doesn't hire a subcontractor in his own plant.

    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    Well, it wouldn't even matter whether... it would include anti-union animus, motive, but it would not only be limited to that. 
    It could be a good business decision where he wants to save some money, and I suggest to you that if he wants to save some money and if he wants to stay an employer and he really just wants to replace his labor costs, that at that point of time he should be dealing with his employees. 
    Now, it's true he doesn't give up his rights to make the ultimate decision to close. 
    He still reserves the prerogative to close. 
    I agree that he has the right, however, if he is going to only do what was done in Fibreboard, subcontract the work to another labor force, and under those circumstances he should bargain. 
    "Bargain", as has been said many, many times, does not give up the right to make the ultimate decision. 
    It just means to listen. 
    I believe he does not have the mandatory bargaining obligation if he genuinely intends or is forced to cease being an employer. 
    Therefore, if his supply of raw materials ends, he has the right to do it unilaterally. 
    If his major customer says, no more business and he's forced out of business, he has the right to do that. 
    If he's just tired of shuttling back between two various places, plants, and he genuinely intends to close and does close one plant without surreptitiously moving the work to the other plant, he has the right to do that. 
    That right does not preclude permissive bargaining. 
    Permissive bargaining says, I'll listen to what you have to say; maybe I don't even want to listen; if I don't want to listen, I don't have to listen. 
    But I may want to talk to you.

   Argument of Norton J. Come
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1385.098" stopTime="1533.633">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    First of all, I'd like to clear up a few things about the facts in this case. 
    The petitioner had a maintenance contract with the Greenpark Nursing Home. 
    Under that contract Greenpark paid the labor cost of the petitioner's employees plus a weekly management fee which was originally $500 and then was cut down to $250. 
    Petitioner experienced difficulties in making out with the reduced management fee and wanted Greenpark to increase it back to a $500 weekly fee. 
    In the meantime, the union was certified by the Labor Board as the representative of petitioner's employees. 
    The union made a demand for bargaining which petitioner did not respond to. 
    When it could not work out its monetary difficulties with Greenpark, it gave notice that it would terminate the contract, which was terminable on 30 days notice, and then two days before the end of the 30 days it told the employees that they were going to be terminated. 
    And that was the first word that the union had that petitioner had a monetary problem.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1533.633" stopTime="1542.692">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Since you emphasize the two days, what if they had given them 30 days notice, as soon as they terminated with the nursing home? 
    Would that make it different?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1542.692" stopTime="1700.861">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, had they given them 30 days, it is conceivable, given the type of monetary problem that petitioner had, that the union would have been able to bargain over ways of reducing the labor costs that would have enabled petitioner to remain with the contract. 
    Because petitioner did not just go out of business. 
    It remained in business at its other, at the other nursing homes that it was servicing. 
    It was willing to remain in business here, according to the testimony of one of its top officials, if the union could work out the problem, but the point is that at that time there was no time left to negotiate, because the petitioner took the position that it was under no duty to bargain with the union about its decision to terminate its operation. 
    Now, as far as the effects bargaining is concerned, it is true that two years after the contract was terminated and when the case was pending in the court of appeals, that the parties did engage in effects bargaining and according to the stipulation in the record some provision for severance pay to the employees was made. 
    I think the facts of this case illustrate why in the Board's view a blanket exemption from the statute for so-called partial closing decisions is not necessary to... well, first of all, it does not effectuate the statutory purposes.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    No, I'm talking about the type of considerations that go into a decision to terminate an operation, as we have here. 
    In many cases the reason to terminate on economic grounds relates to considerations of labor costs, labor productivity. 
    Or where concessions in those areas could alter the decision to close. 
    Experience has, as shown, particularly in the corollary of Cohen, where as a result of give and take on these issues between management and labor, plant closings have been averted.

    And here the man decides he doesn't want to spend his operation in this particular location.

    Well, I think that Judge Adams in the Brockway case summed it up better than I can when he pointed out that a decision to close down can be motivated by a variety of considerations. 
    On some considerations the union is not a very helpful interlocutor.

    I think there's really no difference other than perhaps a difference in formulation between the court of appeals position and that of the Court, which is that as a general principle, there is a duty to bargain about an economic decision to shut down a part of an operation, absent a showing that such bargaining would be futile or significantly interfere with the employer's right to manage his business.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    --The heart of this case was illustrated by a question of Justice Brennan's before the example that he gave of the closing of the auto plants. 
    You have here a situation where labor cost is the major portion of this contract. 
    As a matter of fact, there's no capital investment at all and that Greenpark, the nursing home, furnished even the mops and the pails and the materials. 
    Petitioner furnished only labor. 
    In that sort of a situation the case is very close to Fibreboard because the chances of bargaining, being able to make a difference in the decision to terminate the operation, are sufficiently good to further the statutory purpose of bringing it under the scope of bargaining. 
    In Fibreboard the Court pointed out that the reasons for the employer's decision to contract out, that economies could be derived by reducing the work force, decreasing fringe benefits, and eliminating overtime payments, involved matters peculiarly suitable for resolution within the collective bargaining framework. 
    And the Court held that in those circumstances the chances were sufficiently good that bargaining would be able to work out a resolution of the problem, that the statutory purpose would be served by bringing it within the area of mandatory bargaining.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That is correct. 
    This is a situation where the total price could be kept where it is if the union were willing to reduce wages or introduce some productivity changes that would make the operation more efficient. 
    As a matter of fact, earlier in the year, before the union came into the picture, the nursing home had given petitioner a notice that it was going to terminate its contract because a state inspection had found that its employees were not being efficient enough and petitioner instituted some changes in procedures that improved efficiency and enabled them to continue the contract. 
    It's not necessary to guarantee that something like this could have been achieved. 
    All that is necessary in order to further the statutory purpose is to have a situation where, as in Fibreboard, it is reasonable to believe that something could be done.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    --No, I think you misunderstand me, Your Honor. 
    What I'm saying is that without a contract there would be a duty to bargain. 
    Nowever, in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement the parties can in their negotiations define the, or restrict the limits of the bargaining obligation, and there are contract provisions that provide for advance notice, what sort of bargaining if any has to occur in the event of a termination, what sort of severance pay and things of that sort would be provided? 
    But we never got to first base on that here. 
    But the logic of petitioner's position that there is no duty to bargain at all over the decision would remove from the mandatory bargaining obligation even the situation at the stage of contract negotiations where the parties in advance of such a situation seek to make provision for it. 
    The duty to bargain is a very, very flexible concept.

    Experience has shown, and the authorities that we have cited in our brief, that enlightened management have recognized that you can't meaningfully bargain about the effects if the employees are going to have suspicions and recriminations about the decision. 
    The only way you can get on to meaningful bargaining about the effects is to candidly discuss the reasons for the closings and--

 Mr. Come, I was a little surprised to hear you say that you would accept the court of appeals' view that a presumption was enough to satisfy the Board. 
 Now, suppose the employer comes back and says, look, I didn't want to bargain because economics didn't have anything to do with it, I just didn't like the union. 
 Now, in this very case, a union gets certified, suppose the employer says, I decided to close down this branch because I just don't like unions?

    Mr. Chief Justice-- 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    If I may just for the record possibly correct what may be some confusion concerning the costs which were applicable under the contract between First National and the nursing home, as I said earlier, this was a cost-plus contract which meant any give-back of costs by way of the laborers, the union, the employee saying, I would be willing to take less pay, would in reality inure to the benefit of the nursing home. 
    Now, it might be argued, and I suggest, Your Honors... and forgive me, we're probably off the record, because the record didn't get into this, but in response to the question I would like to. 
    In the nursing home industry in the State of New York we are dealing with predominantly a reimbursement state statute concept under Medicare and Medicaid. 
    The probability is that if there were a cost saving in labor, that the state reimbursement to the nursing home would be proportionately reduced and so the reason why, I might suggest, the respondent is willing accept the 2nd Circuit's presumption that they labeled rebuttable, is because in reality it's not. 
    In this very case it should have been rebutted. 
    The dissent from it points that out admirably well.

    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    Because the contract between Greenpark, which was the nursing home, and First National, says that the nursing home repays the out-of-pocket expenses of First National plus a management fee. 
    So, if you lower the out-of-pocket expenses it doesn't help First National. 
    And I believe that that is a critical point that the dissent in the circuit below makes and in reality is why the presumption is really not a rebuttable presumption. 
    It's an irrebuttable presumption. 
    Because, what happened in this very case is the dilemma that the management community would be faced with. 
    It would be faced with bargaining or making a decision to bargain or not. 
    And then, with the benefit of hindsight, a court or a board would after the fact look at the case and say, oh, you should have bargained. 
    And the record itself might not really be complete. 
    And so I suggest to you that the Ozark rule, the presumption of the the 3rd Circuit in Brockway, the presumption of the 2nd Circuit in First National, all become unworkable. 
    Better is it to apply the concurring opinion of Judge Stewart in Fibreboard.

    Mr. Sanford E. Pollack 
    If you disagree with me, that would be correct, Your Honor. 
    But I believe that the way this Court treated Fibreboard and Darlington indicates very clearly that they considered Telegraphers in line with what I have described, my belief of the case's holding. 
    It seems to me incompatible to say, by the Labor Board, that the Labor Board would not require an employer to bargain about his decision to go totally out of business and move to Florida, but would require that employer to bargain about a decision to close his New York plant and continue in a Florida plant that he may have operated before that time. 
    To me it is incongruous. 
    It defies both the treatment that this Court has afforded to the doctrines of law and, I suggest, logic.
