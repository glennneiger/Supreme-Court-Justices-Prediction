    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Title VII of the Civic Rights Act of 1964 limits the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to make public disclosure of information it has obtained in investigating and attempting to resolve a claim of employment discrimination. 
    We granted certiorari in this case to consider whether the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was correct in holding that a prelitigation disclosure of information in a Commission file to the employee who filed the Title VII claim is a "public" disclosure within the meaning of the statutory restrictions. 
    For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the Court filed today, the judgment of the Court of the Appeals is reversed. 
    Justice Powell took no part in the decision of this case. 
    Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. 
    Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    And Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
