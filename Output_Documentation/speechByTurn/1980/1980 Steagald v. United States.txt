    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    Petitioner was convicted of narcotic offenses on the basis of evidence uncovered during the search of his residence for a federal fugitive. 
    In the courts below, petitioner argued that the search violated the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted without a search warrant. 
    The Court of Appeals objected this contention concluding that the officers who conducted the search were not required to obtain a search warrant because they had an arrest warrant for the same fugitive and reasonably believed that this fugitive might be a guest in petitioner's home. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse. 
    The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the search of a home without a warrant. 
    The arrest warrant possessed by the officers in this case did not satisfy this requirement. 
    It addressed only the issue of whether there was probable cause to arrest the fugitive and therefore did not consider the essential question of whether there was probable cause to believe that the fugitive was located in petitioner's home. 
    The warrant does fail to protect petitioner's Fourth Amendment right to be secure in his home from a forcible and unjustified intrusion by the government. 
    The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment. 
    Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice White joins.
