    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In my argument today I will address the petitioners, Mr. Robert Parratt and Mr. Francis Lugenbill, as the defendants. 
    I will refer to Mr. Taylor as the plaintiff. 
    These are the positions they originally occupied in this action. 
    As a bit of factual background, in April, 1975, the plaintiff was housed in a penal institution in the State of Nebraska of which Mr. Parratt was the warden and Mr. Lugenbill was the supervisor of the hobby counter, which is an internal organism which provides hobby goods for inmates at that institution. 
    The plaintiff ordered hobby material while he was a prisoner; money was deducted from his inmate account to pay the vendor for those goods. 
    Before the goods arrived the plaintiff violated the disciplinary rule and was placed in disciplinary segregation. 
    When the hobby materials arrived the plaintiff was still on disciplinary segregation and was not entitled to have them at that point in time. 
    The materials were signed into the institution by a Mr. Kosta and a Mr. Gero, as a part of their clerical duties at the hobby counter, and the material was held at the hobby counter for the plaintiff. 
    In June, 1975--

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    --Do I agree that it was against prison regulations? 
    No, I do not. 
    I think if you look at the answers to the interrogatories filed by defendant Parratt and defendant Lugenbill, they indicate that those signatures were affixed as part of their clerical duties. 
    I admit that this poses some problems at this point in time, particularly in view of the fact that this case was resolved against us on a motion for summary judgment. 
    But, in our opinion, there does appear to be some question with regard to that particular aspect of the case. 
    In June, 1975, the plaintiff was released from disciplinary segregation and requested that the hobby materials be provided him. 
    A search was made for them and they could not be found. 
    In October of 1975 the plaintiff filed his first complaint with the U.S. District Court and the District Court did not file the complaint and instructed him to return and seek a remedy with the Department of Correctional Services. 
    In November of '75 the plaintiff filed a second complaint. 
    This complaint was filed but dismissed prior to issuance of summons on the grounds that it was frivolous. 
    In March, 1976, a third complaint was filed and summons was issued. 
    In April, 1977, counsel was appointed. 
    In June, 1978, the plaintiff filed his motion for summary judgment, and in October of '78 a judgment was granted the plaintiff against these defendants. 
    The plaintiff during this entire course of conduct never filed a claim under the Nebraska Tort Claims Act for return of the value of these materials, which, it is unquestioned, were lost at the institution. 
    I would like to address two questions which are raised by our brief today in oral argument. 
    First of all, whether the existence of a state created remedy for property loss caused by the negligence of state employees provides adequate legal process under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. 
    Second, I would like to discuss whether simple negligence in the context of a property loss case can create personal liability under Section 1983. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas in Monroe v. Pape set out three basic purposes for the enactment of Section 1983. 
    Number one was to override unconstitutional state laws. 
    Number two was to provide a remedy where state laws were inadequate. 
    Number three was to provide a remedy where an adequate state law was not in fact available to a plaintiff. 
    None of these goals are furthered by imposing liability on these defendants. 
    There is no state law question presented, and there is no showing on this record that an adequate state remedy is not in fact available to a plaintiff under these circumstances.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Well, but I think the thing that you would... I guess I would urge that type of situation be evaluated in the context not so much of imposing personal liability on these persons. 
    If you have a person administering an institution and, not by his personal participation, but certainly property is lost on occasion in these institutions. 
    I don't know that you have a situation where the inmate comes to him and says, I want to be paid, you lost my property. 
    And the warden says, in this case, yes, I know we lost your property. 
    I know the institution lost your property. 
    I personally will not pay you. 
    And the institution does not have the authority to pay you. 
    It seems to me at that point you have a substantial grounds for some interpretation in a declaratory or injunctive sense as to whether or not the inmate has been denied by the absence of a state remedy due process with respect to that.

    --Well, if you've got the problem of what is protected... and I think you have to look at this in the context, it seems to me, of personal liability, and just what exactly the authority of these defendants is with respect to repayment of these types of losses. 
    Our position basically is that the Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment, does not prohibit property deprivations. 
    It only requires that a legal process be available when deprivations occurred. 
    It is the process and not the property which is constitutionally protected and constitutionally significant.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    At the administrative level I think simply he would indicate the circumstances under which his property was lost and the Department of Correctional Services would have the option in this case of coming forward and providing their side of the story. 
    Quite frankly, in this case, I don't see that the Department would have ever taken the position, and very often they do not, that there was no reason not to compensate this man for his loss. 
    The difficulty arises to a certain extent in that our Claims Board is the only board funded in the State of Nebraska to pay this type of claim. 
    The Department of Correctional Services is not funded. 
    These are considered unappropriated expenses and therefore the mechanism of the Claims Board is involved.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Well, I guess in my evaluation of this, we aren't talking about an eminent domain case, because that is where the element of intent comes in. 
    And under these circumstances, where there is no intentional taking, there is certainly no opportunity to provide this man a pre loss process, whatever would be determined to be appropriate in that taking, as in an eminent domain case where you could go in and establish the value before the property is taken. 
    That opportunity simply isn't presented unless you have at least, I would guess, at least a reckless or a wanton and willful... you can argue in that span whether or not there is some intellectual functioning--

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    That is, from a practical standpoint that's one of our serious concerns. 
    Even if as the 8th Circuit, what contact I had with them, their concern was, why simply didn't we settle this case? 
    Why didn't we get it out of their hair? 
    Our position is, even if we took the position... or if we are finally informed that this type of thing does establish a constitutional violation, we are still faced with the substantial burden, if one of these cases is filed in the district court, and we immediately go in and say, yes, we lost the property. 
    We now understand that that constitutes a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, we're going to have 1988 hanging over our head, and every $23 case is going to cost us $200 or $300 or $400 if we get there five minutes after the filing hits the table. 
    This, from a practical standpoint, not from a legal standpoint, it poses a substantial problem for the State. 
    And that is one of the underlying problems that we urge here. 
    I don't think it's a basis for making the decision, but it certainly is a practical problem that we are faced with from the position of prison administration.

    At the present time there were. 
    I think if you look at the record, if you look at Exhibit B on the plaintiff's complaint, it indicates that at least in January, 1976, that he was aware of this state procedure. 
    Now, I do not know and the record does not indicate how he came to be aware, but the second exhibit to his complaint is, I need the numbers on my checks so I can file my state claim. 
    Apparently he was aware of it. 
    Now, why at that point having been provided that information he did not go forward and file the claim, that's an answer I don't have. 
    But... and I do know from my personal contact with the system in the last two years when I've worked with it, that they are regularly informed, that if they have a problem like this, this is the manner in which they can seek redress, is to proceed through that type of mechanism.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Right. 
    Moving on to the negligence question, we think it must be viewed in the narrow context of this case, and that is whether Section 1983 prohibits the unintentional deprivation of property by persons acting under color of state law, and whether such acts would create personal liability? 
    We do not believe that the language of Section 1983, cases of this Court interpreting Section 1983, or the logic, purpose and public policy of that Act, support liability in this instance. 
    There is no evidence that these defendants directly caused or personally participated in the loss of this property Rizzo v. Goode rejected liability without an affirmative participation by the defendants even in an equitable action. 
    And I think we have to realize that the burden of proof, what needs to be proved to obtain equitable or injunctive release, or declaratory relief, under this Act, is not as stringent as should be or what has been imposed to obtain personal liability.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Yes, chief executive officer; technically the warden of that particular institution. 
    Justice Blackmun in Baker v. McCollan said that that reckless failure to stop a pattern of clearly unconstitutional conduct by subordinates could be enjoined under Section 1983, but in that case there was no evidence that defendants knew that there was a problem and that liability was then rejected. 
    We think we have a similar situation here. 
    There's no indication on this record that there was a general failure with the system, and there's no question as to whether these men particularly participated in it. 
    So I think we've got a problem there.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    I am court appointed counsel for the respondent in this case, Bert Taylor, Jr. The respondent cannot concur with the statement of facts as given this morning by the Attorney General's office. 
    I am somewhat shocked to find at this late date that the Attorney General's office is now taking the position that the conduct involved was not in violation of the regulations of the institution. 
    I think that they concede as much in their brief.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    Well, I think, first of all, there is some evidence of intent. 
    But aside from that, I think that, I think the key is, Your Honor, is that they acted... there was an established institutional procedure which they violated, and I suspect that if there had been no institutional procedures and if they had simply left Mr. Taylor's property to the wind or whoever grabbed it when it came to the institution, that there would be no difference. 
    But I'm just saying that I think the facts are different than as related by the Attorney General's office this morning, and they're considerably different. 
    I think the Attorney General's represented... well, as I stated, I think that they can be broken into three different categories, the first being the institutional procedure that was in effect at all times pertinent hereto, and this was set forth in the stipulated facts of the grievance supervisor or officer prepared by the Attorney General's office, at his suggestion, at a hearing on a motion for default judgment in this particular case, filed on behalf of the respondent for their failure to answer interrogatories. 
    And the grievance procedure was, as stipulated to, that normal procedure when a package is received at the institution addressed to an inmate, at the central mail room, it is either that the package is delivered to the inmate's cell where he signs the package receipt, or the inmate is notified to pick the package up at the hobby center and to personally receipt for it. 
    And then it goes on to say that deviations from this practice are only made in exceptional circumstances, and there is no record of there being any exceptional circumstance in this case, which seems to me to be an entirely different case from that as represented to the Court this morning by the Attorney General's office.

    Well, there again, Your Honor, the Attorney General's office has fabricated something out of the record. 
    There was nothing in the record to indicate that he was in deadlock or anything else. 
    He was transferred to the adjustment center. 
    The reason he was transferred there is not in the record, and I know for a fact because I have represented Mr. Taylor since 1973, in this and another litigation, that Mr. Taylor spent time in the adjustment center at his own choosing from time to time because he felt the need to be in the adjustment center for security reasons.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    --Yes, I think we can, Judge. 
    I think that... Your Honor... in this particular case, particularly, I think that we have a situation where the property comes to the institution after he has paid for it and ordered it in accordance with institutional procedures. 
    It is taken into custody when it comes to the mail room to be examined, and when he goes to get the property later on it's not there. 
    And the reason that it's not there is because the institutional procedures were violated, and the reason that the institutional procedures were violated are set forth in the answers to interrogatories filed on October 12, 1976, by the warden and by the supervisor of the hobby center. 
    They set forth an institutional procedure that is totally foreign to what actually should have been going on out there.

 I don't believe we took this case to decide that.

    I thought he was saying in effect that they were in conformance with institutional procedures and therefore were not negligent. 
    But assuming, if we can assume, at least, some negligence... and I think that the conduct on the behalf of the petitioners goes far further than just simple negligence, if we can categorize it. 
    I think that to suggest in this particular case that Mr. Taylor should have proceeded under the State Tort Claims Act in Nebraska, frankly I find a little bit shocking.

    Yes, but I was totally unaware of this, is what I'm saying. 
    I was not advised of it until April, 1977, when I was appointed by the Court to represent him in this case. 
    That's the first time I had knowledge that he has lost his property out there. 
    See, he had been transferred to the State of Arizona. 
    He was serving time in other institutions other than the State of Nebraska, so I did not have day to day, week to week, or even month to month contact with him. 
    But what I'm saying is that at the time I was appointed, there's a two year statute of limitations under the Nebraska Tort Claims Act.

 Your opponent has called our attention to Exhibit B, which is dated January 8, 1976, in which he specifically makes reference to information he needs for filing the small claims form.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    Correct. 
    That's an entirely different procedure than the Nebraska Tort Claims Act. 
    There is also a small claims court in the State of Nebraska and he tried to pursue the small claims court, which is the county court and the municipal court for the City of Lincoln. 
    I tried to track down records, and it's not a part of this record, but I tried to pursue this, and there is no record either in the municipal court or the county court over there, but that that is an entirely different proceeding than the State Tort Claims Act which provides that he must first proceed under the administrative provisions of the Act.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    Oh, I see. 
    Well, yes, I think that's probably correct. 
    But, again, you know, this Court has held, I think, since Monroe v. Pape that Section 1983 is supposedly to be an addition to a state remedy that a state might have provided. 
    And I don't think that we can assume on this record that the Administrative Procedures Act of the Tort Claims Act would have been available, or a successful remedy to him. 
    It is a theoretical remedy, much the same as was discussed in Monroe and in a line of cases since that time. 
    And I think to suggest, if we take Mr. Taylor and say, all right, for a Fourteenth Amendment case you have to go under the State Tort Claims Act, we're putting everybody under the State Tort Claims Act, and it seems to me the end of Section 1983 for Fourteenth Amendment cases.

    It's a question of whether there can be a violation of the Due Process Clause for depriving somebody of property if you stand ready to pay him for it.

    That is correct, and that is true in Nebraska as well, Your Honor, and I'm just saying that in this case, the only thing I know about his small claims application is mentioned in the tag end of his complaint, and he said that he tried it and was dismissed summarily out, twice.

    No, I think that there is more involvement on the warden's part than that, Your Honor. 
    I think that, as I noted earlier, he was charged with the responsibility of administering this procedure. 
    And he was administering a procedure that was worse than no procedure at all. 
    He testified under oath in his answers to interrogatories that he felt the institutional procedure was that anyone who happened to be around, in effect, to receipt for an inmate's property, could do so. 
    And it seems to me this placed him in a position where he could not supervise those under his control, he could not correct the incorrect application of the institutional procedures, and he could not correct the incorrect application of the institutional procedures, and he could not supervise the petitioner Lugenbill, who is charged directly with the control and custody of the property.

    Mr. Kevin Colleran 
    --I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I think there's an important difference in simply property disappearing out of a cell and in a place where an individual orders property through the United States mails in reliance upon an institutional procedure, that he will be able to take that property into custody when it gets there. 
    And he orders that property and pays for it and relies upon it, and then finds when he gets out, the property has disappeared... because institutional procedures haven't been followed. 
    As again, I stated earlier, this was worse than no procedure at all because Mr. Taylor was left in the position where he thought there was an institutional procedure to protect his property. 
    He finds out that not only is the institutional procedure not being followed but there is one that has been placed into effect, apparently by the warden, in the custody of the hobby center, that is worse than no policy at all.

   Rebuttal of J. Kirk Brown
speaker="j_kirk_brown" startTime="3443.083" stopTime="3499.870">
    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    Your Honor, first of all, I would like to point out again, since it came up in Mr. Colleran's argument, we do not look to the existence of the tort claims remedy as an affirmative defense. 
    Our view is that the existence of that remedy or some similar remedy in fact provides the process due under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Therefore, if it is absent in any forum... it's against the plaintiff, although he may not need to allege it specifically under Gomez he certainly would have the burden of proving that as a part of his prima facie case. 
    Second of all, with regard to the use or abuse of state power, it seems to me on this record the only use of state power here was the establishment of the bailment of that property when it came into the institution. 
    And the loss of it, I don't think necessarily involves an abuse of process in any respect.

    I think our position, as we briefed it and it is today is that the Tort Claims Act provides that type of remedy. 
    I think this came out here also. 
    Our small claims remedy may. 
    Due process being as flexible a concept as this Court has pointed it out to be, I think any one of these remedies might be evaluated as providing the process due.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    I made that argument because I know that certain of the district court have employed that argument. 
    I felt it was obligatory on us to raise it. 
    Quite frankly, I don't have any personal belief in the strength of that argument. 
    With regard to any factual dispute, I would simply point out that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the Court was obliged when granting summary judgment to review all the pleadings on file and just ask the Court to review them again. 
    And finally, I would like to say that with regard to the question of negligence and whether simple negligence itself forms a cause of action under 1983, that I think the interest shown by amicus on behalf of the petitioners here, along with petitioners themselves, indicates a strong desire for some guidance from this Court on that question. 
    And I would ask the Court if possible to provide us some sense of where we stand on that question. 
    Finally, I think that if the penal systems of this country are to improve, and I think we all desire that they do, we'll need qualified, intelligent, and reasonable people to run them. 
    And I think we have to be careful not to make penal administration a legal jungle that just has so much potential for liability that actually no reasonable person would want to work in that area.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    --The record... I will grant you, the record in this case is very scanty. 
    The record as I would understand it indicates that he contacted a Mr. Rybolt, who is one of the three parties whose sworn material is before the Court, who was the grievance officer, to look into the matter, and that searches were made to see if the material could be found.

    Mr. J. Kirk Brown 
    And I think we ought to stick to what is on the record. 
    But again, it seems to me, you have the question of where the burden falls as to... inform. 
    Apparently, from the record, Mr. Taylor was aware that some remedy was available to him. 
    Beyond that, quite frankly, the record is not very elaborate.
