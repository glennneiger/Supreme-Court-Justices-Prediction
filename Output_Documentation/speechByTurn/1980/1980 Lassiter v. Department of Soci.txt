    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court today is whether appointed counsel is a process that is due indigent parents when the state initiates actions to terminate their parental rights. 
    The State of North Carolina terminated the parental rights of Abby Gail Lassiter, an indigent imprisoned mother, without affording her the assistance of appointed counsel. 
    This contested proceeding was initiated and prosecuted by the State through its authorized official, the Durham County Department of Social Services, the respondent before this honorable court. 
    The respondent was represented by staff attorneys, and by a social worker. 
    In rendering its decision to terminate parental rights, the trial court expressly stated that it relied upon the testimony before the court and the record before the court. 
    The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, holding that the right to family integrity is a constitutionally protected right, that the State has invaded this constitutionally protected right, but that this invasion was not so serious or unreasonable as to compel the Court to hold that appointed counsel was a process that was constitutionally due the poor. 
    To the contrary, Mr. Justices, appointed counsel is a process that must be due if indigent parents are to be afforded an adequate opportunity to be heard in termination proceedings. 
    There is a per se need for appointed counsel because of the inherent risk that exists otherwise.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Before we leave that, Mr. Evans, is it not inherent in the rationale of the Gault and the other cases that because the juvenile proceeding was so nearly a criminal proceeding, that the criminal safeguards in various respects had to be incorporated? 
    Isn't that the rationale?
speaker="leowen_evans" startTime="291.270" stopTime="361.830">
    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    I think, Mr. Justice, that was the rationale for Gault. 
    However, in Vitek v. Jones, the Court was dealing with the transfer of a prisoner to a mental institution involuntarily. 
    There was no question about his right to freedom from bodily restraint being involved there. 
    That right had already been extinguished and the majority of the Court recognized that there was a right to... I'm sorry... a plurality of the Court recognized there was a need for appointed counsel in those cases to protect the interests involved. 
    Practical considerations will not mitigate against the indigent parent's compelling need to be heard. 
    Specifically, the case at bench is distinguishable from the vast majority of civil cases. 
    Fiscal and administrative burdens involved do not justify the denial of such fundamental right.

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    This Court has recognized that the right to integrity of the family unit is far more precious than property rights, comes that... this right comes to the Court with more respect than those liberties arrived from strictly economic arrangements. 
    Lower courts have recognized that the integrity of the parent child relationship may be more precious than freedom from bodily restraint. 
    Even some lower courts have recognized that the right to integrity of the parent child relationship is more precious than the right to life itself.

    Right. 
    And Stanley said expressly that the liberty interest involved there was far more precious than property rights, and was more precious than those liberty interests derived from shifting the economic arrangements. 
    The lower courts have recognized a per se need for appointed counsel. 
    They justify this position on the fact that inherent risk cause erroneous terminations in such cases. 
    These inherent risks are that the poor be overborne by the resources of the state, that the final decision terminating parental rights will be based on incompetent and inadmissible evidence. 
    Thirdly, that existing procedural safeguards will be lost, and fourthly, that crucial factual disputes and complex issues will go unresolved. 
    The case at bench is certainly illustrative of each of these inherent risks.

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    In that situation you do have the state acting. 
    And you may well have to look to other aspects of this case for distinction, distinguishing this case from that case. 
    Now, this case can be distinguished from the vast majority of civil cases under each prong of the Mathews v. Eldridge analysis. 
    Under the first prong, the--

 Mr. Evans, let me go back to the prior question. 
 Suppose this case had been instituted by a foster parent, not the state. 
 Would you be here?
speaker="leowen_evans" startTime="727.499" stopTime="831.233">
    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    --In North Carolina, Mr. Justice, I believe so. 
    The initiation of the action by a private party there would be the only difference between that case and this case. 
    In a foster parent case you would have the state having a substantial interest in the outcome of the litigation. 
    You would have the state having a parens patriae duty to protect the best interests of the child, to protect the integrity of the family, and indeed you would have, if there's an answer filed in that case, if the indigent parent files an answer in that case, you would have the state appointing counsel to represent the child. 
    So in essence you would have a possibility of the very same case here. 
    An attorney for the child could very well be the adversary to the parent rather than an attorney for the state. 
    In distinguishing this case from the vast majority of civil cases, under each prong of the Mathews v. Eldridge analysis we can distinguish this case. 
    The first prong of the Mathews v. Eldridge analysis is the protectable interest implicated by the governmental action. 
    We've already discussed that this case deals with the government initiating and prosecuting an action. 
    In the vast majority of cases we simply do not have that. 
    This case deals with a basic human right, the right to integrity of the parent child relationship.

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    --I think it shows that... a basic inconsistency. 
    The recognizing of the right to appointed counsel for parents, indigent parents, in abuse, neglect, and dependency cases in which the parental rights is faced with a temporary removal, but not recognizing the same right in a case in which the parental rights is faced with a total severance, certainly is inconsistent.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    And you're making an equal protection argument there? 
    This is the choice of the legislature, to provide counsel in that situation. 
    Now, are you suggesting it's going to have unequal protection, not to supply it here?

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Mr. Justice, I think that there may even be an equal protection argument. 
    We do not reach that today. 
    The argument that we have made today is that the Due Process Clause requires appointment of counsel in these cases.

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    I think, Mr. Justice, that the right should certainly be protected, but first the Court would have to recognize that the child's right to integrity of the family unit is a constitutionally protected right, and as of this point the Court hasn't recognized that. 
    Society... the state has a substantial interest in preventing erroneous deprivations also. 
    The state has the parens patriae duty to protect the best interests of the child. 
    The best interests of children simply are not protected by allowing erroneous deprivations of parental rights. 
    The state has a substantial interest in protecting the family unit. 
    The family unit is responsible for transferring sacred societal values such as morals, cultural beliefs, and political values. 
    The state cannot transfer these values and once the child is placed into foster case, then the state is confronted with the problem of, how do we prepare this child for his future obligations, such as these sacred values that are needed for a well rounded child in our society?

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    The mother, Mr. Justice. 
    The state alleged that the mother did not make a constructive plan for the future of her child. 
    This indigent imprisoned mother made perhaps the only plan. 
    She asked that her child be placed with a member of the extended family. 
    An indigent imprisoned person cannot make any other plans, and must look to the family, its family, to help her. 
    And this plan would have been the most constructive plan for everybody involved. 
    It would have kept the parent child relationship intact; this lady is getting out in a year; she can come home to her family.

    The juvenile court continually admonished her to stop doing so, and finally she gave up her efforts to cross examine.

   Argument of Thomas Russell Odom
speaker="thomas_russell_odom" startTime="1712.856" stopTime="1843.189">
    Mr. Thomas Russell Odom 
    Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court: 
    At the outset I would like to point out to you that under North Carolina law there are two different proceedings by which the Department of Social Services makes an effort to address family problems. 
    The statute provides, the statutory scheme provides that the Department of Social Services must investigate and to the extent necessary intervene in those cases where parents can no longer be presumed to be giving proper care and supervision to their children. 
    Those cases I will denominate custody cases which in addressing the statute that was called into question a few minutes ago I will also call abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings. 
    It is this proceeding which represents the initial intrusion into the family unit, into what Mr. Evans would call the family integrity. 
    The child is still with the parents, the parents are presumed, as they are entitled to, to be providing proper care and supervision. 
    It comes to the attention of the Department of Social Services that they are not, and the Department brings this action to court. 
    Because it is the initial and most, I would argue, significant intrusion into the family unit, the Legislature of North Carolina has provided that both the parent and the child be provided with an attorney if they cannot afford one. 
    That is the purpose of the statute, Mr. Justice Marshall, that you asked about earlier. 
    Now, there is a different statutory scheme in North Carolina for the termination of parental rights. 
    That is a totally separate proceeding from the abuse, neglect, dependency custody proceeding.

    Mr. Thomas Russell Odom 
    That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    At the initial custody hearing, if the court determines that the child is to be removed and placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services, which is what happened in this case in May of 1975, the Department's interest tends to shift very subtly from that of parens patriae to in loco parentis. 
    The court has given the Department of Social Services certain responsibilities in providing for the interests of this individual child. 
    There are provisions in the law that are being refined constantly by which the court can direct both the parents and the Department of Social Services to work together to try to reunify this family, to put the child back into the home. 
    There are provisions in the law now that require that the custody decision that removed the child be reviewed every six months to make sure that the court's mandate is being followed. 
    Now, that did not happen in this case. 
    That statutory provision has been enacted subsequent to this. 
    But what happened in this case was that the family, once the child was removed from the home, the family abandoned this child, in foster care. 
    The mother testified that she had seen him once or twice, she had in fact visited with him once at the request of the social worker, but she had not seen him any other time. 
    And there was a period of more than a year from the time that the child was in fact removed from her custody until she went into prison, at which time or during which time you could presume that she had the freedom to make some contest or some--

    They chose to make it, in fact, a judicial proceeding to take out of the hands of the Department of Social Services the right to make that determination, and they did that because of the recognition of the Legislature of the importance of the family right.

 Does the record disclose whether between the removal in 1975 and the termination in 1978 a Department social worker ever contacted the petitioner or her mother?

    Mr. Thomas Russell Odom 
    Yes, it does.

    Mr. Thomas Russell Odom 
    It shows that she contacted the mother and discussed with her the idea of perhaps giving the child up for adoption or terminating her rights or asking her what she wanted to do with the child, and all she said was, I want the child to live with my mother. 
    The social worker then contacted the mother and... at least the transcript... this particular record does not, but Mr. Evans had the transcript lodged with the court... shows that the worker says she contacted the grandmother on several occasions and was told by the grandmother, I can't take care of the child.

    Mr. Thomas Russell Odom 
    In fact, though, the petition was brought on two grounds and the court concluded as a matter of law that she had failed to maintain concern or responsibility as to the child's welfare. 
    And I would submit to the court that the fact that a parent is in prison does not prevent them from maintaining concern or responsibility as to the child's welfare. 
    And she had made no effort to do that. 
    Now, I wouldn't argue that it would have prevented a finding that she had willfully abandoned him, and that was not alleged in this case. 
    I think, in trying to sum up, the obverse of the problem that we're struggling with is, if this Court requires the appointment of counsel in a civil action as a matter of constitutional law, the Court will be hard pressed to limit it and will be placed in the position, from here on, of making a determination as to what right is most fundamental enough to require it, and those that are not fundamental enough to require it.

   Argument of Steven Mansfield Shaber
speaker="steven_mansfield_shaber" startTime="2982.595" stopTime="3052.255">
    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Perhaps I might begin, Justice Rehnquist, by following up on your question about whether or not the state could dispense with counsel altogether in these hearings. 
    And frankly, sir, I think not, notwithstanding Parham v. J.R. And the reason I think not is that the degree of importance that's attached to the family relationship in Stanley v. Illinois and the other child custody cases is such that the Court would not be able to hold that counsel could be barred from the hearings. 
    Justice Brennan, you asked if counsel that are appointed in neglect cases carry over? 
    Mr. Odom says that in practice they sometimes do. 
    It is not the position of the state that they necessarily are entitled to carry over, although that is the practice of many state district court judges. 
    The question simply has not been addressed in North Carolina law.

speaker="steven_mansfield_shaber" startTime="3059.509" stopTime="3135.925">
    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    Your Honor, I can suggest a couple of possible distinctions. 
    I should say more than possible; I think they are the distinctions. 
    First is this, that the intrusion at the time of the neglect hearing is really the more important intrusion because that's what separates a child from the parent and disrupts the care and companionship of the child. 
    That's what really sunders the family, and from that point on what the parent has is not an interest in the companionship of the child but the expectation that with the help of the state the child may come back some time in the future. 
    That interest is a much lower interest. 
    The second point is this, that the County Department of Social Services being charged with this obligation to try and restore the family, and having this obligation not only from the time of the neglect hearing on, but prior to the neglect hearing, finds itself in sort of a conflict of interest situation. 
    It's supposed to protect the child on one hand and on the other hand it's supposed to try and put the family back together. 
    And one way to keep the County Department of Social Services out of trouble given this inherent conflict in its responsibilities is to appoint an attorney for the child and an attorney for the parent, and that's what the state does. 
    The third point, I think, is that very often, although not always, the neglect... sir?

    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    By the time the termination hearing comes along, Justice Stevens, the County Department of Social Services has made a decision that the child cannot go home and should not go home. 
    It no longer has an obligation to try and restore that family. 
    It is exclusively concerned with trying to protect the best interests of the child throughout the rest of its life. 
    And so it's not divided; it no longer has--

    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    --Yes, sir, Your Honor, I concede the irony in that, and I would nevertheless suggest that the reason is that by the time you get to the termination action, the state's interest is really not readily distinguishable from the interest of any other private person who under the termination statute might also have had standing to bring a termination of parental rights action. 
    Once the state... it settles in civil cases generally... the state stands as a private litigant and may bring its resources to bear against its opponent. 
    And when you eliminate that conflict of interest--

    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    If I might, let me speak very briefly to the prospect that this decision might be held to be retroactive. 
    The state recognizes that it is asking this court to do something which it has only done once before, and that was in Morrissey v. Brewer. 
    We are saying that if the petitioner prevails on this case, we would like language in the opinion such as is in Morrissey to the effect that it is wholly prospective. 
    Justice Stevens saw fit to speak to the question of retroactive and prospective application in Caban v. Mohammed. 
    Justice Frankfurter did the same in his separate opinion in Griffin v. Illinois. 
    We think that this is really a unique case. 
    There are children in North Carolina who have been adopted, whose families are settled. 
    They ought not run the risk if this decision, if against us, is retroactive. 
    Likewise, there are children in North Carolina whose parental rights have been terminated and they--

    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    --Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court: 
    If I may follow up on a question that Justice Brennan posed before lunch, the question about whether or not you can draw lines between categories of cases. 
    Justice Brennan asked, what would happen if perhaps a termination of parental rights action were brought by a private party instead of by a county Department of Social Services? 
    And in fact that case exists. 
    It's being held in abeyance in the Eastern District of North Carolina pending the result in this decision. 
    But there is a husband who is asserting that he has a right to an appointed attorney in a termination of parental rights action which was prosecuted by his wife, without any other government involvement in that.

    Similarly, there's a case pending in North Carolina--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3503.470" stopTime="3510.374">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Did he explain to anyone how if he can't afford a lawyer he's going to support his child?
speaker="steven_mansfield_shaber" startTime="3510.374" stopTime="3588.889">
    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    --No, sir, he doesn't. 
    It is more ironic than that, Justice Burger, because the man prevailed in the termination action. 
    This is a 1983 action on behalf of the winner saying that notwithstanding the fact that I won I should have had an attorney at the earlier case. 
    It's an interesting little case. 
    We've got a case in North Carolina where the question is whether there should be appointed counsel on behalf of the respondent in a child support action which was prosecuted by the county. 
    And you know that in the light of Boddie v. Connecticut, there have been two State Supreme Court cases where the question is, whether or not a respondent in a domestic action has got a right to a court appointed attorney. 
    Now, this line, between cases involving personal liberty and your physical freedom, and all the other kind of civil cases, is under assault all over the country. 
    I would suggest that the Court needs to consider that very carefully and that if they do they're going to remember that the history of the right to counsel in a criminal case is one which shows that distinctions based on degree, distinctions based on the seriousness of the offense, are not distinctions which are going to be able to hold over time, we've moved from Powell to Argersinger and Scott.

    Mr. Steven Mansfield Shaber 
    I suggested to Justice Rehnquist that the counsel would have to be provided in those instances... perhaps not in your hypothetical... simply because this right to family integrity has been given special treatment by this Court in Stanley and the following cases. 
    Thank you very much.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You have about three minutes remaining, Mr. Evans.
speaker="leowen_evans" startTime="3654.164" stopTime="3757.647">
    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Thank you, Mr. Justice. 
    There are several points I wanted to address that the Court raised. 
    The first is, drawing a line. 
    This case is certainly distinguishable from the majority of civil cases. 
    This case is formal and complex; adversarial... not informal. 
    The full panoply of evidentiary rules apply. 
    The full panoply of procedural safeguards apply. 
    A formal finding of fact and conclusions must be made. 
    It's judicial, not administrative; governmentally initiated, prosecuted, and financed. 
    The records that are used and the testimony that are used in these cases often involve testimony by a paid state agent and records that have been compiled by a paid state agent. 
    Likewise, you can look to each of the prongs of Mathews to find points of distinction. 
    Under the first point, state initiated, state prosecuted, the fundamentalness of the interests. 
    Under the governmental interest involved we have the government moving as a party, we have the government having a substantial parens patriae interest. 
    We just don't have that in other cases. 
    Under the third prong of Mathews v. Eldridge we have the government overbearing the indigent parent by his resources and advocacy skills. 
    In the vast majority of civil cases, we simply just do not have that.

    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    --The Sixth Amendment does, Justice Stewart. 
    As far as the questions as to what effort this parent... these... the family made towards obtaining this child after the child went into foster care, at the very outset the grandmother asked the Department of Social Services to place the child with her. 
    The mother wanted the child to be placed with her. 
    You can find reference to this request in the trial transcript at page 52.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3807.061" stopTime="3812.115">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Is there some reference to the notion that she was not able to take care?
speaker="leowen_evans" startTime="3812.115" stopTime="3937.609">
    Mr. Leowen Evans 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    There was an allegation by the social worker that she said that she could not take care of the child, that members of her church said that she could not take care of the child. 
    However, at the trial the grandmother testified that she never made such statements and indeed, that she never would make such statements, because these five children involved are her only grandchildren. 
    She has four children. 
    Petitioner is the only child that has children, and she said that this is my only family and there's no way that I would give up that right. 
    Likewise, in reference to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about diligent effort, the Department of Social Services did not make a diligent effort in this case to try to strengthen the parent child relationship. 
    The Department made only one visit to this parent during the two years in issue, one visit. 
    This visit was made three months prior to filing a termination of parental rights petition, and the visit was made for the express purpose to ask the parent to give up her parent child relationship. 
    Two years, one visit, asking the parent to give up the parent child relationship, certainly cannot be classified as a diligent effort to strengthen the parent child relationship. 
    In reference to Mr. Justice Brennan's questions about abuse and neglect, abuse and neglect are grounds for termination of parental rights in North Carolina. 
    So that you do not have to have a prior adjudication in which the child is actually put into the custody of DSS, of Department of Social Services, and be any subsequent termination action under certain situations--
