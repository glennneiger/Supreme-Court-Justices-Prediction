    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question whether the President of the United States acting through the Secretary of State has the authority to revoke the passport of an American citizen whose international travel activities concededly have caused and will continue to cause serious damage to the national security and to the foreign policy of the United States. 
    The jurisdiction of this Court is found in 28 U.S.C. 2254(1), and the facts that give rise to this controversy may be succinctly stated. 
    For 11 years, from 1957 until 1968, respondent, an American citizen, was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency in the course of which employment he took an oath which this Court considered in Snepp recently, not to divulge, except upon prior approval, any information gained in the course of his employment. 
    During the course of his employment he became acquainted with the techniques of intelligence gathering of the Central Intelligence Agency, and learned the identities of many covert operatives who were employed by or utilized by that agency. 
    Many of these persons are still employed abroad by the agency. 
    In 1974 respondent publicly announced his intention to disrupt and to destroy the Central Intelligence Agency. 
    I'd like to direct the Court's attention to Footnote 2 on page 3 of our brief in which, in an extraordinary press release in London on October 3, 1974, he said... and I'll just mention the first paragraph: 
    "Today I announced a new campaign to fight the United States CIA wherever it is operating. " 
    "This campaign will have two main functions: First, to expose CIA officers and agents and to take the measures necessary to drive them out of the countries where they are operating; secondly, to seek within the United States to have the CIA abolished. "

    The respondent has traveled abroad extensively from his current residence in the Federal Republic of Germany, and is purported to identify CIA agents, employees, and sources in several countries. 
    These activities have resulted in a number of understandable consequences, including his exclusion from four West European countries because of these activities. 
    On one occasion his coauthor of a book in Kingston, Jamaica, identified 15 reported CIA agents whose homes... the homes of two of which were violently attacked by armed men subsequent to the disclosure.

    What is the purpose of a passport? 
    It's been my own experience in the couple of times I've been abroad other than in the Army that you don't need a passport to get out of this country.

    A passport is currently required both to enter and to leave the United States under an Act of Congress in 1978, unless the President provides otherwise by rule. 
    And he has provided otherwise by rule with reference to any country, I believe, in this hemisphere except Cuba, and certain Western European countries do not require it either.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think that if the President should appoint Mr. X as his ambassador plenipotentiary to the Middle East and direct the Secretary of State who is his employee to issue a passport to him, that Congress could prohibit the issuance of that passport?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    I think not, and I'm confident he could not, and it may be that there is a general rule which would exclude a person. 
    Certainly, the authorization vested in the President in the Travel Control Act of 1978 would more than cover that, because the President can exempt from the operation of this statute, which forbids departure and reentry without a passport, according to rules and regulations that he might promulgate. 
    There are... to reply to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's first question, the passport as I understand it serves two purposes. 
    First, the purpose of identifying the bearer as a citizen or a national of the issuing nation; and second, to request free passage for him from a foreign nation as well as the efforts of the foreign nation to facilitate his travel.

    There very well may have been because before 1856 the Congress did not enter this area of passport control at all. 
    Before 1856, the first passport act, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and indeed other persons, including governors, mayors, and in some instances notaries public executed, issued passports, and the purpose of the Act of 1856, as we point out in our brief, was to restrict the issuance just to the Secretary of State, acting under the President of the United States, under such rules and regulations as he might promulgate.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That's exactly right, and except in time of war, there were few instances when it occurred. 
    As we show historically in our brief, in the War of 1812, for example, for the first time that we could trace, a passport was required for travel control, and this applied to persons who had crossed the enemy lines. 
    I think this was in 1815. 
    The second time I believe it happened was at the time of the Civil War, when again a travel control statute was enacted. 
    The third time was 1918, just after the First World War, when again a travel control statute was issued. 
    And part of our argument, of course, is that when these travel control statutes... and I could take the others from 1918. 
    There was 1941, and 1952, and then 1978. 
    When each of these travel control statutes was passed, they assumed that the President would be issuing and refusing to issue passports, because a travel control act would make sense to require a passport if it didn't emanate from someplace, nor would it make sense if there was not the power to revoke or, indeed, to decline its issuance. 
    And we contend that this is evidence that the Congress intended the Secretary of State to have the authority which we insist he possessed here to revoke respondent's passport.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    And that's the Kent case, where this Court without reaching the constitutional contention that was made there, held that a passport could not be denied a person because of his political affiliation. 
    And later when the Congress attempted to do that, in Aptheker and Dayton this Court determined that it was unconstitutional to do it. 
    We're not contending for thought control, or the control of associations here. 
    We're contending that when a citizen's activities, not his thoughts, abroad are causing or are likely to cause serious damage to the national security and the foreign policy of the United States, that the President has the power not to issue the passport or, if having issued it, to revoke it. 
    That's exactly what happened in this case when in December, 1979, just a month after the seizure of the hostages in Teheran, and after this extraordinary statement at a press conference by the respondent, the Secretary of State notified respondent that his passport had been revoked and told him that he was entitled to a hearing under the appropriate regulation, and offered to hold an expedited hearing in West Germany where respondent lives.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think that the Congress would have the authority to do that? 
    Take this hypothetical, that the Congress decides that there are just too many people leaving the country and traveling around and as a result we're having to provide too much protection in the way of military force abroad, because they're getting into trouble. 
    So we don't want anybody leaving the country and therefore we forbid the issuance of passports.

    This is certainly our contention.

    The court below did not reach the constitutional questions that respondent raised, and we don't think these constitutional questions are substantial.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    It was renewed in '78; yes. 
    Because they're only good for five years. 
    This case does involve the constitutional right to travel. 
    According to doctrine by this Court in Kent and Zemel, the power to issue passports is a power that ultimately is within the authority of the Congress of the United States, and Congress must authorize either explicitly or implicitly any curtailment on the right to travel. 
    The Government, of course, concedes that there's no explicit authorization in this case, and the task of this Court is to see whether it can divine from the history presented to it by the Government and by ourselves as well whether there is any implicit authorization which has to be based as the Court held in Kent and Zemel on a substantial and consistent administrative practice. 
    I would like to just summarize our argument in a nutshell and then treat each of the separate arguments individually. 
    Our first argument is that Kent itself disposes of this case, because Kent, taken together with its companion case Dayton, in fact was a case which dealt with matters of national security and foreign policy considerations. 
    It was not merely a case confined to speech and association, as the Government would have the Court see it. 
    Two, should the Court disagree with our analysis about the extent of Kent, then we can show historically that there is a total absence of any substantial and consistent practice, which is required to find that Congress implicitly authorized the regulation involved in this case. 
    Both of those arguments are supported by the fact that after Kent was decided by this Court in 1958, the then Administration tried very, very hard, and very, very unsuccessfully to secure legislation which would authorize the very kind of authority which it has exercised in this case against Mr. Agee. 
    And finally, looking around for what the intention of Congress actually is, we come to the amendments in 1978, substantial amendments in 1978, of Section 211(a), which is the fundamental passport authority, and Section 1185, which is the lineal descendent of all of the wartime national emergency provisions.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2067.898" stopTime="2080.640">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Mr. Wulf, to what extent do you think that Congress can limit the President's authority to revoke or grant a passport to someone whom he has previously issued it to?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="2080.640" stopTime="2092.364">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    According to the decision in Kent, he has plenary... Congress has plenary authority. 
    The authority resides in Congress, it does not reside in the Executive Branch.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think that if the President appoints an ambassador to Italy and trouble comes up in Italy and the President summons the ambassador home, that the ambassador can simply stay in Italy and keep his passport, saying I've got a right to travel and I'm not going to come home?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="2115.129" stopTime="2118.765">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, he can certainly be deposed and--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2118.765" stopTime="2122.967">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    He wouldn't be ambassador for long, I'm sure, but--
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="2122.967" stopTime="2218.031">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    --Not at all. 
    Yes. 
    I think he can refuse to come home. 
    In that case he would presumably have a diplomatic passport; he might have to turn that one in. 
    He'd be entitled to reissuance of a standard passport if he was no longer ambassador. 
    In 1978, explicitly, Congress expressed what its intentions were, and its intentions there were to withdraw whatever authority the Court had allowed it to exercise in the area of geographical restrictions, in the Zemel case; and secondly, it revoked Section 1185 of the Title VIII, which was the travel control statute, and reversed the purpose of that statute 180 degrees and required, although it still requires that passports be used for entry and exit by citizens of the United States, the purpose is not to allow the Executive Branch to exercise travel control over citizens who hold passports, but to facilitate... and that is explicitly what is in all of the congressional history relating to 1185... to facilitate travel of American citizens because of the now general requirement abroad that travelers present passports upon entry to foreign countries.

    The party in Dayton v.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    The statements that Mr. Agee released are expressions, political expressions which are protected under the First Amendment. 
    There's no First Amendment protection to engage in espionage or sabotage. 
    I think the Dayton case is worse than the Agee case. 
    I don't think the Agee case is bad, but I think that in the Government's terms Dayton is worse. 
    Our brief essentially here today is that given the Government's best case, in its brief, in terms of the historical information which it has provided the Court, that this Court cannot confidently conclude that the Congress has implicitly authorized the power which the Government seeks to exercise here, that the Government's best case leaves it very doubtful, leaves it very ambiguous, leaves it very uncertain, about whether the kind of implicit authorization which is required has been found, will be found in this case.

    Justice Jr. 
    Well, might I ask, Mr. Wulf, the same question I asked of the Solicitor General about that information in Footnote 7 of the Court of Appeals' opinion? 
    Is that the fact, do you know? 
    It's at page 14a of the Petition for Cert. It states that 21 passport applications in '55 and ten passport applications in '56 were refused because the applicants were 
    "participants in political affairs abroad whose activities were deemed harmful to good relations. "

    Well, wouldn't that be significant in terms of the issue you're now arguing if that were so?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="2473.980" stopTime="2541.891">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    I think they are insignificant, Your Honor, because there's no explanation about what they mean. 
    And they're as insignificant as are the other statistics which the Government has provided to the Court, because of the admixture of the kinds of... I'm looking for the... because of the different kinds of categories under which those various passports were revoked, or refused. 
    And it's in our brief, what is lumped together, there were in 1955 refusal of passports in six cases. 
    At the same time there were persons whose previous conduct abroad has been such as to bring discredit on the United States and cause difficulty for other Americans, gave bad checks, left unpaid debts, had difficulties with police, et cetera. 
    There's another category in '56 which refers to--

    Justice Jr. 
    Well, I agree with you, Mr. Wulf, that we're not told how many of those 36-odd were bad check, unpaid debt, difficulty with the police, and that sort of thing.

    The fact is that I think that those statistics are completely useless because of the totally inadequate description of what they were all about. 
    I mean, if there are 56 such cases, 55 of them could have been for bad checks and one of them might have been for something related to foreign policy and national security. 
    But I think that this Court can't make a decision based upon that kind of data which is just totally insufficient.

    That's right. 
    If that was done abroad, if it's not a crime within the United States... it might be, under some statute; I wouldn't want to say conclusively... but if it's according to Kent, there are only two grounds upon which the Executive Branch can refuse to issue passports. 
    One, whether or not the applicant is a citizen; and two, whether the applicant is trying to escape the foils of the law, as the opinion put it.

    In general that is my position.

    And in fact, he us now subject to that agreement. 
    There is an injunction outstanding against him, which he is complying with. 
    So whatever... as of the past few months.

    But I fully intend to breach my contract by going abroad.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, the Government described seven in its brief, extending from 1906 to 1970, and then, of course, it also lumps together those other--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3465.345" stopTime="3467.797">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Twenty-odd.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3467.797" stopTime="3542.779">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    --Well, there were 62 in their opening brief. 
    It turns out to be 100 in their reply brief, of those nondescript cases out of the statistics. 
    Specifically they refer to seven cases in the last 75 years which they claim as the basis for their support of an administrative practice. 
    They're in the brief and it was only one of them, in 1970, which was in fact under the same regulation. 
    The others weren't under any regulation at all, as a matter of fact. 
    It was... they were just under the claimed discretion of the Secretary of State. 
    As I said in opening, I think that these examples of administrative practice presented to the Court by the Government are far too ambiguous, far too uncertain a basis upon which this Court ought to rest its judgment that they will find implicit authorization. 
    I think that that--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Implicit authorization to do what?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3544.547" stopTime="3550.618">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    --Implicit authorization for the regulation applied here against Mr. Agee.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3550.618" stopTime="3553.570">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean, to revoke for these reasons?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3553.570" stopTime="3554.903">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    To refuse passports--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3554.903" stopTime="3556.689">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because you agree that there is a power to revoke?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3556.689" stopTime="3558.974">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    --Yes. 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3558.974" stopTime="3559.707">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    For the right reasons?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3559.707" stopTime="3560.441">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Quite; quite right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3560.441" stopTime="3562.593">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And there's a historical practice of revoking--
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3562.593" stopTime="3563.209">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3563.209" stopTime="3565.628">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --But not for the reasons claimed?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3565.628" stopTime="3590.576">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Precisely; yes. 
    And with that... and the Court ought not make that decision on the basis of the evidence here. 
    That decision ought to be, the Court ought to require, in light of the fact that this is a constitutional right, that Congress exclusively say what its intentions are with respect to this kind of power which is asserted in the regulation before the Court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3590.576" stopTime="3603.884">
    Justice Jr. 
    Well, anyway, Mr. Wulf, you would argue that if there were explicit statutory authorization to revoke for this kind of conduct, the statute to that extent was unconstitutional because this kind of conduct has First Amendment protection?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3603.884" stopTime="3650.448">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    I would make that argument, but then we would deal squarely with the constitutionality in First Amendment terms of the authority which was concededly granted to the Executive Branch. 
    But today we don't believe that that authority exists. 
    I think that the 1978 amendments really settle this case. 
    There Congress revoked what authority this Court had given to the Government in the Zemel case regarding geographical restrictions, which certainly shows an intent to withdraw whatever authority the Executive Branch had with respect to national security and foreign policy considerations. 
    We believe that the decision below should be affirmed.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3650.448" stopTime="3654.936">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Solicitor General, do you have any? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Wade H. McCree, Jr.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3654.936" stopTime="3767.692">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    If I have 60 seconds left I'd like to call the Court's attention to two matters. 
    First, in response to counsel's claim about the effect and the intent of the 1978 amendments, I would refer you to page 47 of our brief, where we set forth the Senate report which makes it clear, and I read: 
    "The Committee recognizes clearly that the passport authority should not be restricted in any way which would limit the President's ability to control the departure of United States citizens to foreign countries when such travel is inconsistent with a greater Government interest. " 
    The other matter to which I would like to direct the Court's attention, if I may, is on this seven-page reply memorandum that we filed to the Petition for Certiorari, where we set forth the colloquy conducted by the court and counsel in the district court, where counsel under very careful questioning concedes that for the purpose of the determination of the validity of this regulation, he concedes that his client was causing or likely to cause serious damage to the national security. 
    And I suggest, therefore, that he admits that he is fully within the ambit of this regulation which means that this Court needn't decide the question whether his conduct was within the regulation. 
    Of course, it leaves the constitutional question as well as the statutory authorization question to be determined. 
    And with that, we would submit our case on the briefs.
