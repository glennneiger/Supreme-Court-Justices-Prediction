    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Little v. Streater. 
    Mr. Blue, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    From time to time in the history of our country technological innovations have played a decisive role in the formation of constitutional doctrine. 
    This is a paternity case in which an indigent defendant was denied access to a blood grouping test that conclusively exonerates more than 90 percent of all falsely accused putative fathers. 
    A Connecticut statute categorically restricts access to this test to those defendants able to purchase it in advance of trial.

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    It exonerates 90 percent of innocent putative fathers 100 percent of the time. 
    In other words, if you have 100 accused putative fathers, none of whom are the actual fathers. 
    The blood test, standard blood test available everywhere, will conclusively show that 91 or 93, depending on the race, of those men are not the father. 
    With the other seven to nine percent, the test will simply be inconclusive.

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Mr. Chief Justice, there is no Connecticut state law on the subject, although the statute we are appealing from speaks in terms of definite exclusion. 
    I can represent to you that there is simply no one case in the history of Connecticut, so far as I know, in which a defendant has been found guilty in the face of exculpatory blood test evidence, and does in fact have this practical--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="302.809" stopTime="304.745">

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    --Well, that's correct; that's correct.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="313.851" stopTime="321.188">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You can cross-examine the people who make the test, can't you, and isn't there often cross-examination of experts who make tests?
speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="321.188" stopTime="382.678">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Well, that is correct, because this is quite a different type of evidence than ordinary expert witness testimony that we're inclined to think of in, for example criminal cases; in, for example, a criminal case where you have psychiatric testimony indicating that the defendant is or is not sane. 
    You will have a situation in which different experts might hold honestly, might honestly hold different beliefs and have different observations of the same phenomena. 
    This is not the case with blood test evidence where there is a showing of exclusion; there will be no doubt as to the fact that the man is in fact excluded, and you simply do not have the type of disagreement between expert witnesses that you would, for example, in a criminal case involving psychiatric testimony. 
    It is really quite a distinct type of evidence even in the universe of expert testimony.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="382.678" stopTime="443.066">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In a marijuana case or a drug possession case, for example, a typical type of evidence put on is to show that the packet possessed by the defendant was the same one submitted to the laboratory and is now in court. 
    And certainly the defense lawyer is permitted to cross-examine as to the passage of control from one person to another in that chain. 
    I would think, in laboratory examinations, that defense counsel is certainly permitted in most states, at any rate, to cross-examine as to, was this blood testimony, or was this blood sample the one actually taken? 
    Was there a mix-up in the laboratory? 
    And that type of thing.
speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="443.066" stopTime="448.303">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="461.611" stopTime="463.729">

    I didn't say how you could get a witness to say that a blood test isn't accurate.
speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="463.729" stopTime="575.050">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    --That's right. 
    It would virtually never happen. 
    I mean... theoretically, some state laws might permit cross-examination as to whether blood samples have been switched, but in practice, the practical effect of that type of allowance is de minimis because in the overwhelming number of cases I think that even my opponent would concede that blood test evidence does have an indisputable quality to it when it yields an indication of exoneration. 
    And it does have a sweeping capability to exonerate that is simply not shared by other evidence, be is testimonial evidence or for that matter other scientific evidence in the ordinary cases that one might think of. 
    Now, it's our position that these distinctions which I have drawn make the constitutional difference, and the difference goes to both the truth-seeking function of the Court, or of the factfinder, whichever that may be, and also because the inevitable result of the distinction or the discrimination that Connecticut has chosen to draw is a dual system of justice. 
    I recall, in the case of United States v. Raddatz last term, Justice Blackmun in his concurring opinion pointed out that the focus of the Due Process Clause is a practical concern for accurate results, and surely few cases can be imagined in which that practical concern has a greater impact than in this case. 
    This Court has particularly been concerned with accuracy in the past years in Fourth Amendment cases involving the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment.

    And is the cost of a blood test sampling taxable as costs in a paternity proceeding in which the defendant is acquitted?
speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="585.858" stopTime="619.765">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    In some states it's discretionary though I believe I mentioned that in a footnote in my brief. 
    In Connecticut there is no reason as to why it might not be, and I would simply point out in that regard that we are not asking for a gratuitous subsidy. 
    But the State could, to minimize its own expenditure of costs, simply require that when the blood test fails, is taken and fails to exonerate the defendant, that the cost will be taxed as cost. 
    I believe that that is done specifically by statute in Kansas and Wisconsin, at least.

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    The difference is two-fold. 
    In the first place, an ordinary expert witness testimony will turn, as other testimony on matters of credibility, can be disputed. 
    Moreover, with exotic testimony, it will require a great deal of money to obtain. 
    You are out of the situation we have here where the test is readily available, and not only will you--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="805.526" stopTime="815.397">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    --Well, I would draw a distinction between the type of evidence which is ordinarily obtainable by the typical nonindigent defendant and the type of evidence which would only be available to more wealthy people which would create a somewhat different equal protection argument. 
    With the type of expert... of course you haven't elaborated what type of expert in South Africa you're referring to, if the expert was an expert comparable to blood test evidence in the sense that he was overwhelmingly likely to conclusively show, conclusively show that the defendant was innocent if he was in fact innocent, then that would present a case, obviously, very similar to the case we have before us, but expert--

    What do you mean by the other situation, Justice Blackmun?
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1027.417" stopTime="1043.646">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, take a purely private paternity action, and if the blood test is so crucial and so conclusive, on your theory if the putative father is indigent, shouldn't the State pay for that also?
speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="1043.646" stopTime="1099.382">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    In due process terms I think it makes a great deal of difference whether the plaintiff, the actual plaintiff is the State or a purely private person. 
    Because I think that the Fourteenth Amendment, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company, draws a sharp distinction between deprivations by the State and deprivations by private people, no matter how wrongful, against which the Fourteenth Amendment offers no appeal. 
    In terms of equal protection, it may well not be evident who is the plaintiff. 
    The same disparity of treatment would exist between indigent defendants and nonindigent defendants. 
    But the State is the plaintiff in this case and the only line that I am urging the Court to draw certainly in terms of due process is a line that involves the fact that the real force, the real moving party in interest here was the State of Connecticut.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1099.382" stopTime="1106.202">

speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="1106.202" stopTime="1137.007">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    That is in large part correct, because the fact of the matter is that like the would-be plaintiffs in Boddie, who were would-be plaintiffs, there is no alternative to the judicial process for the defendant in this case. 
    And I suppose, unlike Boddie, he may not be... Mr. Little may not be analogized to a defendant, he is a defendant, and there's no question that he should be entitled to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny that typically--

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    But the way you got off, and the distinction that you drew to get off, was the distinction between voluntary and involuntary litigants. 
    The Court emphasized in Kras and reemphasized in Ortwein that the would-be plaintiffs in those cases had alternatives to the judicial process, alternatives which the defendant here in this case simply doesn't have.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But in Cuyler v. Sullivan, last year, in which this Court held that the standard for performance of counsel retained was the same as the counsel appointed, because the resulting judgment was the judgment of a state court imposing a certain penalty on a person, and therefore it was state action.

    Yes. 
    Well, wouldn't that apply here too, whether it's a private plaintiff or the State is a plaintiff?

speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="1229.850" stopTime="1257.750">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is a legitimate argument, and the Court might well rightfully hold that the same result should pertain to all defendants, whether or not they're prosecuted by the State. 
    But I want to point out that the fact remains that the real plaintiff here, throwing all its power and resources at the indigent defendant, was the State. 
    And in terms of traditional due process analysis, that makes a great deal of difference.

    Maybe you know the answer to this. 
    Suppose there's a judgment against the putative father in a case like this and there has been no blood test. 
    And he's determined to be the father. 
    And he can't afford a blood test or for some... later he has a blood test and it's proved that he isn't. 
    Can the case be reopened or does res judicata bar it?

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    That's a question I would like for you, very much to see you ask my colleague, Mr. McGovern. 
    Under Connecticut state law, as I have pondered the question, I believe that the judgment is clearly res judicata. 
    It would ease--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1350.410" stopTime="1355.695">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    I don't know, and I'm not sure that the question has even come up. 
    Let me explain the practical reason why the question probably has never come up.

speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="1370.872" stopTime="1440.366">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    The problem is that it's not just the matter of a man who has suddenly won the lottery after years of indigency walking into a hospital and asking for a blood test to be taken. 
    The blood test must be taken from the child, the mother, and the putative father, and in order to practically arrange for that type of a blood test to be taken you need a court order. 
    And in the absence of an existing open case, that type of court order is virtually impossible to get. 
    I don't know of a single case in which, at any level, at which that question you raise has been decided and I suspect that the reason is the very practical reason that I've discussed, which simply points out the fact that because of the fortuity that the defendant is indigent at the time the case is brought, and if he is indeed found guilty without the absence of blood test evidence he, so far as I can determine, will never in practical or legal terms be able to reopen that case. 
    And any money that he gets subsequently that might be used to pay for a blood test will in fact only be usable to pay for the judgment deficiency against him.

    A Connecticut statute now requires, I believe, a $60 fee for a jury.

    Counsel, we've taken, or you have taken with us two-thirds of your time on this scientific-medical. 
    I'll just ask you one short question. 
    Are you familiar with the numerous cases of malpractice brought against laboratories that do blood testing for making errors in the blood tests which cause damage to the people involved because the doctors relied on the tests? 
    Are you familiar with the fact that that's happened?

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Mr. Chief Justice, perhaps through my own lack of knowledge I'm not familiar with those cases in the particular context of blood grouping tests in paternity cases.

    For instance, tests for venereal disease--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1532.506" stopTime="1532.706">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you use a blood--

    --which might in fact be quite different.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1533.990" stopTime="1538.177">

    --You use it for other purposes than paternity cases, do you not?

    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    Yes. 
    Different types of tests. 
    I mean, the fact of the matter is that blood test is a generic term. 
    What we are talking about here is a blood grouping test.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1546.183" stopTime="1551.753">

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If you give the wrong blood to a person in a transfusion, you're in a very serious business.

speaker="jon_c_blue" startTime="1563.977" stopTime="1646.631">
    Mr. Jon C. Blue 
    --Okay. 
    Well, my only... I'm not familiar with that phenomenon, although I'm not disputing that the phenomenon may exist. 
    My point, Mr. Chief Justice, is not... is simply the fact that blood grouping tests in the context of ongoing paternity cases are treated as controlling and decisive. 
    And this fact, this indisputable fact... I don't think that the Attorney General even disputes it... necessarily results in, when you have a distinction like the Connecticut Legislature has drawn in this case, of a gross disparity between the indigent and the non-indigent in as far as the quality of justice administered or received by these litigants, not just wealthy litigants, but nonindigent litigants receive if they are innocent, are overwhelmingly likely to receive swift, scientific, certain exoneration, whereas all indigent defendants regardless of their actual guilt or innocence are thrust into swearing contests in which the trier of fact will often desperately try to arrive at the correct result.

    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court: 
    My name is Stephen J. McGovern. 
    I'm Assistant Attorney General in the State of Connecticut. 
    I think it should be pointed out in this case that paternity actions in the State of Connecticut are civil litigations. 
    Mr. Blue's brief tries to--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2013.134" stopTime="2015.919">

    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    I'd like to explain that in the State of Connecticut a paternity action is instituted by a verified petitioner with a summons and an order to appear at a date certain for trial.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2030.013" stopTime="2046.038">
    Justice Blackmun 
    Let me ask this. 
    There is a judgment here and support money has to be paid. 
    Supposing he doesn't pay it. 
    Can he be incarcerated for nonpayment? 
    Is that a criminal act?
speaker="stephen_j_mcgovern" startTime="2046.038" stopTime="2133.810">
    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    No, it isn't, Your Honor. 
    There is a state statute which provides for nonsupport. 
    That is a criminal statute. 
    However, stemming from the paternity judgment, in the paternity section of our statutes there is a provision for contempt citations. 
    They are civil contempts. 
    They're remedial in nature and they're not punitive. 
    The goal of these contempts is to secure the money that is not paid. 
    To have the defendant in a paternity case be found to be in contempt of court for nonpayment of support, there must be a showing that he willfully failed to meet the support order. 
    He either refused or neglected to pay it. 
    The fact the defendant is indigent would certainly not be the basis for his incarceration as being in contempt. 
    The paternity action is brought by a regular civil complaint for a date certain. 
    As in other states... some states provide that a defendant would be arrested and have to post bail. 
    That is not the case in Connecticut. 
    A civil trial is held, there is an adjudication, possibly, of paternity. 
    That adjudication certainly doesn't subject the defendant to incarceration.

    It does not stem from a paternity judgment itself.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. McGovern, do you understand the gist of your opponent's complaint in this case to be the failure of the State of Connecticut to allow blood grouping tests to be taxed against a state or against the private plaintiff, if it were to go that far, if the blood grouping tests prove to the satisfaction of the trier of fact that the defendant is not the father, or the failure to advance the money necessary to get the blood grouping test?
speaker="stephen_j_mcgovern" startTime="2204.822" stopTime="2237.209">
    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    There is no provision in the statute, Your Honor, for the taxing of cost. 
    The paternity statute itself, under which judgment is entered, provides that the cost of support and maintenance of the minor child, attorneys' fees, sheriff's fees, may be taxed as cost. 
    There is no provision under the statute that the cost of the blood grouping test be paid and I have never seen a case in which a defendant prevailed in the State of Connecticut in which costs were taxed against the State.

    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    The fact that other states have chosen to fund the cost of blood grouping tests does not mean that the State of Connecticut should be made to do likewise. 
    The State has certain priorities in administering its judicial system. 
    It chooses to have the litigants in civil litigation bear the cost of that litigation. 
    I think that this is reasonably based.

    Mr. McGovern, the most recent case cited in the appellant's brief, to which my brother Stewart has referred, is a case called, cited as 6 Connecticut Circuit Court 516. 
    What is the circuit court in Connecticut?
speaker="stephen_j_mcgovern" startTime="3459.818" stopTime="3491.206">
    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    The circuit court no longer exists in Connecticut. 
    That was the court of lower jurisdiction which existed in Connecticut during the early 1970s. 
    That court was abolished and became the Court of Common Pleas and the courts evolved and merged into one court at this time, a Superior Court. 
    That was not a decision of the court of highest jurisdiction in the State; a trial court.

    Could I suggest that your colleague at the bottom of page 34 of his brief cites a Connecticut Supreme Court case, Mosher v. Bennett?

    Yes, Your Honor.

    And that quote is this: 
    "The prima facie case so made out. " 
    --that's by the plaintiff... 
    "places upon the reputed father the burden of showing his innocence of the charge, and under our practice he must do so by other evidence than his own. " 
    Now, it says, 
    "the burden of showing his innocence. " 
    And you accept that as the law of Connecticut?
speaker="stephen_j_mcgovern" startTime="3542.322" stopTime="3544.757">
    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    Currently that is the law of Connecticut, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3544.757" stopTime="3548.326">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's a 1929 case. 
    Has the Supreme Court of Connecticut--
speaker="stephen_j_mcgovern" startTime="3548.326" stopTime="3652.476">
    Mr. Stephen J. McGovern 
    No, it hasn't. 
    No. 
    That issue hasn't been before the court since then. 
    Finally, Your Honor, the appellant has argued that, he hasn't argued today but in his brief that this inability to provide a blood grouping test violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
    Normally, this Court in making equal protection analysis has used either a strict scrutiny test or a rational basis test. 
    Strict scrutiny is invoked when there's a fundamental right which has been violated or a suspect classification exists. 
    I don't believe in this case, Your Honor, that the right to a blood test, is a fundamental right in a civil litigation, and also that wealth-indigency is one of those suspect classes which warrant strict scrutiny by the Court and require the Court to show that there's a compelling State interest in the statute. 
    The State of Connecticut should be made to comply with the rational basis test and only have to show that there's a reasonable basis for the statute with the cost being paid only by the party who wishes to use the evidence in the litigation.
