Edwards v. Arizona

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Edwards v. Arizona. 
    Mr. Meehan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Arizona Supreme Court which affirmed a conviction of Petitioner Edwards which included the use of incriminating testimony given by him to police officers at an interrogation just before he was to be given appointive counsel at his first court appearance. 
    The offenses arise from a robbery of a bar in Tucson, Arizona, in October of 1974. 
    The case went unsolved for a considerable period of time but ultimately by gaining confessions from two accomplices the police solved the case sometime before January 19, 1976, about 15 months after the offenses. 
    At that point the police obtained a complaint from a magistrate to determine probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed, who issued an arrest warrant for Robert Edwards. 
    The police then went to a slum area of Tucson and arrested Edwards, who then was young and indigent, and took him to the Tucson Police Department.

    He was 23 at that time, Your Honor. 
    He was 24 at the time of the trial, which was more than a year later. 
    At the Police Department he was read his Miranda rights, which he said he understood. 
    He gave a recorded statement at the Tucson Police Department, when interrogated by a police detective named Bunting. 
    At that time his statement was denying any implication in the offense.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    Well, Your Honor, they did until a week ago today when they filed a supplemental brief. 
    But in their brief they very expressly, in that portion of the argument, agreed that he had been formally charged. 
    As a matter of fact they agreed in the statement their question presented. 
    After the tape recording of the statement, Edwards and Detective Bunting had an exchange back and forth about whether he would make a further statement. 
    He apparently tried to convince the police that they should talk with him about some kind of a deal. 
    The police said that they would give him a chance to tell his side of the story but they would not entertain any kind of deal. 
    Ultimately, Edwards was taken for holding overnight at the Pima County jail after he told Detective Bunting in words to the effect: I'm not going to make a statement now, I'm not going to make a deal now, I'm going to wait until I get my attorney.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    I think that 1:30 when he was given a first arraignment, or possibly if he had, of his own, changed his mind and decided that he wanted to talk further with the police; yes, he should not have been interrogated without--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="210.588" stopTime="218.196">

    Chief Justice Burger 
    I'm not talking about this case, now.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    --I understand.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="228.879" stopTime="233.347">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I'm talking about trying to discern your position.
speaker="michael_j_meehan" startTime="233.347" stopTime="341.366">
    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    My position is that in terms of application of Miranda, Mr. Chief Justice, that unless truly the accused himself institutes a change of mind, that there should be no reinterrogation until counsel has a chance to confer with the accused who has asked for it. 
    This Court made very clear, I think, in Miranda, that that situation, where an accused asks for a lawyer, should be treated differently from the situation where the accused simply listens to the rights and then goes ahead and speaks or even listens to the rights being read to him and decides to remain silent, which indicates that he is feeling capable of making his own decisions about whether to deal with the interrogating officers or not to deal with them. 
    It was said in Miranda and this Court confirmed in a majority and concurring opinions in Mosley, and in Innis, and in Fare v. Michael C., that Miranda meant what it said; that unless... at least as far as the police reinterrogation... once the accused has been read his Miranda rights and says he'd like to have a lawyer, that there shall be no reinterrogation until a lawyer is provided. 
    This case demonstrates, I think, why that often is no great burden, because there was no reason that the interrogation couldn't have been carried out after 1:30 on the 20th of January. 
    Instead it was carried out on the morning of 20 January, hours before Edwards would be making his first appearance and at a time when the police were aware that Edwards as an indigent would be appointed counsel that afternoon. 
    They knew that he was about to get a lawyer.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    And, indeed, in Miranda, what was said was, we're not holding that the police have to have a lawyer in every precinct. 
    But I'd like to emphasize two things about this case. 
    One, the case was solved. 
    They were not looking for additional offenders, they were not further investigating the case, they were not looking for the fruits or the instrumentalities of the crime such as may have been a justification in Innis had that been held to have been an interrogation, they were not trying to locate the body as was the case in Brewer v. Williams, there was no urgency. 
    And even under Miranda it seems to me, once the accused says, I would like a lawyer, he's indicating that he feels that he needs to have that help, he needs to have somebody with him; he's acknowledging that the inherent coercive atmosphere, custodial interrogation, which is the focus of the Miranda guarantee, and the reason for the warnings and affording the right to counsel is affecting him.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    I think that's an assumption that can't be made at this point, because at the trial the evidence included the testimony of the police officers, but also testimony of an accomplice named Cleveland Reed. 
    There was also obtained, and before this interrogation of Edwards, a tape-recorded confession of another accomplice named Soto. 
    As a matter of fact that tape recorded confession had been played, several minutes of it, at least, for Edwards on the morning of his interrogation, which prompted the admissions that are the subject of this case.

speaker="michael_j_meehan" startTime="498.897" stopTime="644.791">
    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    I think I would treat it as having been solved by virtue of what the police felt at the time that they undertook the interrogation, and I think, number one, it would be somewhat unrealistic to have a set of facts in which there were three different statements without Miranda rights having been read to them. 
    But secondly, it seems to me the focus has to be at the time of the interrogation. 
    What was the motive of the police in undertaking this interrogation? 
    At that time the offense was old, they were not, you know, on the trail of additional accomplices. 
    They felt, as the State said in its opener, its responsor brief, they felt they had enough evidence. 
    That's exactly what the State said in its brief, and they did. 
    And they presented it to a magistrate, and a magistrate then has the right and the obligation to weigh that evidence, to cross-examine the complaining officer, to determine whether or not there's probable cause to believe that an offense was committed, and the defendant committed it, and if so to in effect file the complaint, which is to say, to approve the complaint and then to issue the arrest warrant. 
    There are, of course, two issues presented in this case, one under Miranda and one under the Sixth Amendment. 
    Because the State has recently chosen to argue that no formal prosecution had begun in this case, I would like to spend more time talking about the Sixth Amendment aspects of it than the Miranda aspects. 
    As I said, in the courts below and in its briefs in this Court, except the supplemental brief, the State has agreed with the Petitioner that at the time of this interrogation formal prosecution had begun and the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment as a critical stage had arisen. 
    A week ago the State contended on the virtue of a Second Circuit case construing federal criminal rules of procedure that no formal prosecution had begun. 
    I think the State was correct in its first position. 
    In Arizona, under the criminal rules, prosecution may be commenced in two ways, either by indictment or by complaint. 
    In this case prosecution was commenced by the filing of a complaint.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    Yes, Your Honor, it had been filed with the magistrate. 
    Now, in Arizona the probable cause proceedings and the complaint are begun before a magistrate, which typically is a police court or a justice court, as it is in Arizona. 
    And ultimately, those documents are then filed in the prosecution file in the Court of General Jurisdiction, which is the Superior Court. 
    And that filing did occur somewhat after the day of the interrogation. 
    But in terms of the magistrate receiving the complaint and having the officer appear before him and taking sworn testimony if he chooses to do so, and so forth, this was done on the 19th of January.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    It's Footnote 47 on page 24. 
    The respondent recognizes the efficacy of Massiah and also cites without dispute the McLeod case of this Court, which was handed down very shortly after Massiah and which I think supports the position that we have here that it's not important that this interrogation was carried out just before the appointment of counsel rather than just after, because of the holding of this Court in vacating what the Ohio courts had done in McLeod. 
    That distinction, I think, is clearly not important. 
    I would say that the distinction is important in terms of the due process argument that we make, and also in terms of the motivation of the interrogating officers at this point. 
    I think it's fair to say that knowing that the petitioner would have counsel appointed for him that afternoon and knowing that any counsel worth his salt is going to fully apprise this defendant of what he is charged with and what the severity of the charges are and what the police can do with a statement and so forth is going to advise this defendant, not now to try quickly to make a deal by giving a statement or to make a statement at all.

    No. 
    It was not... it is an ex parte hearing. 
    Arizona has kind of a strange term for it. 
    We used to call it "a one-man grand jury" because it can be a very full-blown hearing or it can be a very perfunctory hearing in which the magistrate having placed before him a rather routine felony complaint and having no basis to disagree with what's sworn to by the officer simply says, yes, and, I'll issue the complaint. 
    As an example, one of the other ways that this rule has been used in times before the middle 70s when Arizona began to use grand juries with regularity, the so-called one-man grand jury was used to investigate corruption in public office. 
    We had a sheriff in Pima County who was rather famous, indeed, I would say, notorious, whose prosecution was originally begun with the earlier procedural equivalent of this Rule 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 procedure.

    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I'm not sure, that it was the 27th or so of January. 
    It was fairly shortly after, but it was after the interrogation. 
    I should point out one problem with getting into this area of formal prosecution. 
    Edwards was arrested in 1976. 
    He was not tried until April of 1977, and in the interim the charges against him were dismissed because of procedural problems not germane to the confession. 
    When the case went up to the Arizona Supreme Court, we briefed and argued this matter, a speedy trial and other things, and pointed out that only the second court's file went up to the Arizona Supreme Court, and said that we would move to amend or supplement the record if necessary. 
    The State agreed with us in their briefs before the Supreme Court as to the sequence of events, and they agreed with us here as to the sequence of events. 
    So, physically speaking, the papers on the indictment from the first case and the complaint are not within this Court's record, but I can ask the Clerk to supplement that if that becomes necessary or appropriate.

    Not motive entirely. 
    I think motive is important in deciding what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. 
    I think that motive is important here because, number one, there are no countervailing considerations to require prompt interrogation. 
    If there were some other problem, if the body of the murder victim were still to be located or if there may be other persons who were involved and should be identified, or if there was a dangerous weapon like in Innis, and there was a need right now to see whether this defendant would waive his rights and answer questions so that those other investigative activities quite properly undertaken could be furthered, maybe the interrogation should occur right away.

    Well, I think that the situations themselves are going to be fairly easily divisible into categories and of course one reason I think this situation is fairly easily divisible into the category that I'm describing is the fact of the complaint, and the police believing that, they'd been working on the case for 15 months, they believe now they've got enough, they've gotten two statements, the time between the offense and the arrest, and so forth, I think simply tells them at that time and tells this Court at this time that we're dealing with a post-complaint, a post-indictment... to use a shorthand term... interrogation.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1245.787" stopTime="1247.551">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, then, did he get this notice on the 20th?
speaker="michael_j_meehan" startTime="1247.551" stopTime="1520.205">
    Mr. Michael J. Meehan 
    The record indicates that he was shown a copy of the arrest warrant at the time he was arrested on the 19th, shown in the sense, I am sure, of not handing it to him to read but to support the arrest, because there is an indication that there was a scuffle at the time of the arrest. 
    He was told generally that he was an accused in a murder case on the 19th when he was interrogated by Sergeant Bunting at the Tucson Police Department. 
    In terms of explaining to him precisely what the charges were, precisely what the penalties were, precisely where they were in stage of proceedings and so forth, the record doesn't show that he was given that information at any time before he made the statement on the morning of the 20th that, I'll tell you... I'll talk with you, but I don't want anything tape recorded because I don't want it used against me in court. 
    It seems to me that the State must argue, and obviously does argue, that Edwards' Sixth Amendment right was waived, and the question then becomes whether in fact a waiver can occur of that right and whether it can be supported by the facts in this case. 
    Brewer v. Williams is the closest that this Court has come to finding what will support a waiver in a Sixth Amendment as opposed to a Miranda or a Fifth Amendment kind of a case. 
    Brewer did not, however, reach what would be sufficient. 
    All other waivers of trial rights, rights like the right to counsel, which involved the factfinding process, the fairness of the trial, and the reliability of the trial, have always been required to be made in open court and approved and supervised by a trial judge, so far as I can tell. 
    This Court has said in in the Schneckloth case that the high standard of waiver which I think applies in the Sixth Amendment kinds of cases requires a showing of knowledge, understanding, and voluntary relinquishment that can only, or at least is designed to be carried out in that kind of a setting. 
    I submit that in the case that's before the Court, there is no justification for finding a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 
    It's possible that in order to establish the very high standard that this Court has imposed by Johnson v. Zerbst and by Fare v. Michael C., and by at least in dictum Schneckloth, and Faretta v. California for waiver of right to counsel at a critical stage, that a waiver should be either conducted before a magistrate or a judge in open court so that the record can be made that should be made. 
    Or that it cannot be accepted unless counsel has had a chance to consult and advise the client, or at the very least, that it be an express waiver of a kind that would provide independent evidence. 
    And I say, independent from the testimony of those who really have an interest in establishing a waiver, a videotape, an audio tape, or even a written waiver. 
    I'm not suggesting that this Court needs to accept or reject any one of the three or that even any one of the three necessarily have to be exclusive, but it seems to me that the cases of this Court impose a very high standard of joined waiver and that in order to fulfill that some kind of quite reliable factfinding process needs to be undertaken before there can be a waiver. 
    In this case, what do we have that would establish a waiver? 
    Number one, when the police went to the jail on the morning of the 20th to interrogate Edwards, he said he didn't want to talk to them. 
    He told the detention officer he didn't want to come out of "the hole", as he described it. 
    Number two, after he was given his Miranda rights and was read a tape recording of another accomplice, he made the very conflicting statement, I'll tell you what you want to hear, but I don't want it recorded because I don't want it used against me in court. 
    The police said, big deal. 
    There are two of us here; we can testify to what you say. 
    He didn't say, oh, okay. 
    He said, I don't want it used against me in court so I don't want it tape recorded. 
    And finally, he did not say anything about giving up his right to counsel. 
    He didn't say, well, I wanted a lawyer yesterday but today I feel more able to deal for myself and so I don't want one today. 
    Under these facts, it seems to me there can be no waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

   Argument of Crane McClennen
speaker="crane_mcclennen" startTime="1619.479" stopTime="1724.266">
    Mr. Crane McClennen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves two issues, admissibility of a confession after a request for an attorney, and the waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 
    The State feels that there are several important facts to be considered in this case. 
    First is, Mr. Edwards was warned of his right four times. 
    Now there is fairly considerable disagreement about this, but Sergeant Bunting, everyone agrees, advised him twice: once at the beginning of the interview and once on the tape. 
    Detective Marmion advised him of his rights the next morning. 
    And on page 70 of the record Mr. Edwards himself says that Officer Allen advised him of his rights... page 70 of the Appendix: 
    "Question: At any time did Sgt. " 
    "Bunting or Steve Bunting, the other detective, read you your Miranda rights? " 
    "Answer: No. " 
    "It was a detective... it was a black policeman in a car. " 
    "I don't know his name. " 
    That was four times. 
    On the night of January 19, after the discussion, after the tape recorded statement, and after the discussion back and forth about the deal, Mr. Edwards never said, 
    "I do not want to talk to you again until I see an attorney. " 
    He never said, 
    "I will not answer any more questions till I see an attorney. " 
    What he said was, 
    "I will wait until I get an attorney before I make a deal. " 
    "I'll wait till then before I make a statement. "

    Mr. Crane McClennen 
    No, Justice Rehnquist, the proceedings, March 4 and March 7, those are the proceedings at the suppression hearing. 
    Then, the proceedings, March 21 and 28, the latter part of March, that is the first trial, the one that ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. 
    The proceedings in April were the second trial where Mr. Edwards was convicted. 
    Now, the next morning, when Detective Marmion went to visit Mr. Edwards, the reason why Detective Marmion went to visit Mr. Edwards, it was Detective Marmion's case. 
    He had been assigned as the lead detective in that case. 
    It was his responsibility. 
    The reason why Detective Marmion did not arrest Mr. Edwards, Marmion and Milne were in the process of arresting Manny Soto while Sergeant Bunting and Detective Bunting and Officer Allen were arresting Mr. Edwards. 
    These took place simultaneously. 
    Marmion and Milne the night of the 19th were interrogating Mr. Soto while Sergeant Bunting was interrogating Mr. Edwards. 
    So Detective Marmion whose case it was had not had an-opportunity to talk to Mr. Edwards the night of the 19th. 
    In his case, he was interested in what Mr. Edwards had to say, so he went to the jail the next morning, read Mr. Edwards his rights. 
    Mr. Edwards acknowledged them, said he'll answer the questions, but then Mr. Edwards said, but first I want to hear Manny Soto's tape. 
    Detective Marmion played the tape per Mr. Edwards' request, and that caused Mr. Edwards to confess. 
    The tape--

    Mr. Crane McClennen 
    Well, this Court has said in Fare v. Michael C. that the request for an attorney is a per se indication of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
    It's our position that if a person could invoke the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, if you can later withdraw it, as in Michigan v. Mosley, if the request for an attorney invokes the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, he can again withdraw that, as the cases we've cited have said... United States v. Rodriguez-Gastelum, White v. Finkbeiner, U.S. v. Hauck. 
    In Rodriguez-Gastelum they said, do you want to talk? 
    The man said, yes, but with an attorney. 
    The policeman didn't stop; he said, do you want to talk to me without an attorney? 
    The man said, all right. 
    The 9th Circuit said, that's all right.

    No. 
    Under the Arizona Constitution Article 20, Subsection 30, 
    "No person shall be prosecuted criminally in any court of record for felony or misdemeanor otherwise than by information or indictment. " 
    So the State must either get a supervening indictment or take the person to a preliminary hearing and if he is bound over to Superior Court, file an information. 
    The State cannot proceed on a complaint alone. 
    It's our position that the complaint is not the adversary proceedings.

    Well, but charge is the fulcrum of Massiah, and both arguments are made in this case, and it's important to distinguish the two, because they do factually run into each other, but as a matter of constitutional law they're quite distinct.
speaker="crane_mcclennen" startTime="3327.013" stopTime="3362.108">
    Mr. Crane McClennen 
    Yes. 
    What's interesting in Miranda, at page 469, the Court says, 
    "You must tell him that what he says can be used against him because he's faced with a phase of the adversary system. " 
    And at page 477, it again says, 
    "It is at this point that our adversary system of criminal procedure commences. " 
    Now, that's under Miranda. 
    But it's our position that the filing of the complaint does not begin the adversary judicial criminal proceedings for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment. 
    It's not an adversary proceeding.

    Mr. Crane McClennen 
    Right. 
    However, in this case, we contend they didn't start then. 
    It's also our position, even if they did start, he waived them. 
    Because he knew he was charged with a crime. 
    They showed him a copy of the arrest warrant. 
    Sergeant Bunting discussed the charges with him... Mr. Edwards, on page 101 and 102 of the brief... 
    "I advised him of the charge and showed him a copy of the warrant. " 
    And at page 104: 
    "Question: Did you have any other conversations +..? " 
    He knew that he was charged with a crime, he knew that he had the right to an attorney; he had previously been convicted after a plea of armed robbery, he had previously been tried and acquitted of attempted assault on a mailman. 
    At this case he defended himself.

    One or two items, if I may.

    Or it may have decided that it wasn't relevant. 
    Well, with a concession by the State in the Supreme Court of Arizona that he had been formally charged with an offense, I would think that-- 
    --If the Arizona Supreme court was conscious of the law that your friend has just mentioned that the complaint does not formally commence the proceeding, then the Arizona Supreme Court may have concluded that that was the law without discussing it.
