Howe v. Smith
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="64.834">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Robert Howe v. Attorney General. 
    Mr. Nelson, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="william_a_nelson" startTime="64.834" stopTime="124.622">
    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The petitioner is a Vermont convict who is in prison, not in Vermont, but in the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. 
    He challenges his incarceration by the United States and asks his return to the custody of Vermont. 
    The case involves two statutes, two federal statutes, and turns on the construction of one of them. 
    Section 4001(a) of Title 13 guarantees that no citizen shall be imprisoned by the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress. 
    Section 5003(a) of the same title authorizes the Attorney General to accept custody of state prisoners when the Director of the Bureau of Prisons certifies that proper and adequate treatment facilities and personnel are available. 
    The question is the construction of that section.

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    That would be because of Section 4001 of Title 18, which prohibits imprisonment except pursuant to an act of Congress. 
    That would prohibit imprisonment by executive order or by executive arrangement, such as the contract which was made in this case.

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Well, let's look at the face of 5003. 
    It's at page 2 of our brief. 
    Subsection (a) contains two clauses; grammatically, it's an independent clause. 
    The independent clause, as Your Honor points out, permits the Attorney General to contract with appropriate officials of a state for the custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and training of inmates. 
    That's just about everything, the full range of penological purposes, as one circuit court has put it. 
    That's one thing that that section does. 
    The other thing it does is it limits that power to cases where the Director of the Bureau of Prisons certifies that adequate and proper treatment facilities and personnel are available.

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Justice Rehnquist, we agree that this statute is talking about transfers of inmates to federal prisons, and clearly custody is involved. 
    The question is, when may those transfers occur? 
    Must they be, may they be at any time for any purpose, or for no purpose at all, as in an intrastate transfer situation? 
    That's the respondent's view. 
    Our view is that it can occur only in cases of treatment needs where there are treatment facilities available in the federal prison system. 
    Our view is supported by the construction placed on this statute by the House committee which passed it. 
    It said that the section was limited to inmates with treatment needs. 
    In the Senate the same view was expressed, although perhaps not quite so clearly. 
    Senator McCarran, asked what the bill would accomplish, said it would permit the transfer of state inmates to federal prison in certain circumstances in a limited category of cases. 
    Neither of those sources indicates that this statute gave the Attorney General a blank check to accept any state inmates for any purpose.

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Well, the only way the statute could work is if it had something like the broad custody, care, subsistence, education clause in it, otherwise the Federal Government would only be in charge of the treatment aspects and everything else would be up in the air. 
    There would be no authorization for general custody. 
    May I refer the Court to another, to two sections of the Youth Corrections Act, Sections 512 and 513 of the YCA. 
    This statute, incidentally, is right next door to the Youth Corrections Act. 
    The Youth Corrections Act permits placements of youth offenders in treatment facilities; precisely the same language used in 5003(a) is used in Section 512 of the Youth Corrections Act. 
    It's clear that 5003(a) was modeled after 512, in part, after 512 of the Youth Corrections Act.

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    The detaining authority is the Federal Government. 
    He is clearly under federal detention. 
    There may be a question of whether he is in custody in a legal sense of the state or of the Federal Government, but I don't think that there's a serious question that he is, in a real sense in federal detention, that he is imprisoned or detained by the Federal Government.

    Did it mean, was that a euphemism for "prison"? 
    The only way that this statute can be construed as a general blanket authorization to take state inmates to help the states out with their prison problems, for whatever reason, is to read treatment facilities and personnel as a euphemism for federal prison. 
    I think there are compelling reasons not to read it that way.

speaker="william_a_nelson" startTime="1349.802" stopTime="1498.100">
    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Yes. 
    I would give up. 
    Well, I've been focusing on what it means and what I think the words mean in common speech. 
    What don't they... I mean, I don't think that treatment facilities and personnel can mean prison industries or other types of rehabilitative programs. 
    I don't think that the man in charge of the canvas shop at Terre Haute is a treatment officer, or that the officers in charge of athletic programs or religious programming are treatment personnel. 
    That is a jargon use of the phrase. 
    There's another mark against the 2nd Circuit's reading. 
    Treatment appears twice in this statute, first in the phrase "treatment facilities" and second in the list of items contracted for. 
    If it means custody, essentially, in its appearance, first appearance in the statute, then it must mean something very different in the second appearance in the statute. 
    In the second appearance it's different from custody, care, subsistence, education, and training. 
    So the reading of the statute that the respondents propose requires that treatment be given two radically different meanings within one sentence. 
    And it requires also that we presume Congress was using a jargon or technical usage when there is no indication that it was. 
    In fact, the Court, if it is of a mind to, can read Title 18 of the Code from cover to cover and not find a single instance where "treatment facilities" is used as a euphemism for prison, or as anything but a definition of specialized types of treatment. 
    It is used in the Youth Corrections Act to define a type of commitment different from ordinary prison. 
    It is used in the Narcotic Addiction Rehabilitation Act to define a type of commitment different from ordinary prison; therapeutic.

    Are you suggesting, do I take the argument to mean that this institution does not have a medical unit, for example, to deal with people who become ill, or that they have no facilities to deal with a person who has alcoholic tendencies when he arrives, although surely he couldn't become an alcoholic after he got there?

    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    Well, Justice Marshall, if we take the word "treatment" out, then transfers would be authorized where there were adequate and proper facilities and personnel available, and then we would have no case. 
    I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Barbara E. Etkind
speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="1690.725" stopTime="1847.069">
    Ms. Barbara E. Etkind 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The primary issue presented by this case is whether a state prisoner is ineligible for transfer to federal custody under 18 U.S.C. 5003 unless he has a need for specialized treatment that is available in the federal prison system. 
    It is the position of the United States and the State of Vermont that Section 5003 is not so limited. 
    Rather, in our view, the statutory requirements are met and any state prisoner regardless of treatment needs may be transferred from state to federal custody once a contract has been entered into between the state and federal governments, and once the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons has certified that facilities in federal institutions are available. 
    On behalf of the United States I shall explain how the language of the statute, its legislative history, and its consistent administrative application require that construction. 
    The Attorney General of the State of Vermont will discuss the state's vital interest in having this statute construed in the manner we urge. 
    Preliminarily, in response to Justice Marshall's question, we would say that our certification saying that facilities in federal institutions are available would imply that treatment facilities are also available, because what we have in the federal system are in fact treatment facilities; they are available. 
    Also, with respect to the question regarding transfer under the Interstate Correctional Compact, not only could he be transferred to New Hampshire, in which case he could be visited more easily, he could also be transferred presumably to Colorado, in which case it would be even more difficult for his family to visit him, yet he would assert no challenge to that type of transfer. 
    There is no suggestion in the statutory language that the federal prison system's authority to assume custody of a state prisoner is conditioned on the prisoner's need for specialized treatment available in the federal system. 
    The plain language of Section 5003(a), as the Court recognizes, authorizes the Attorney General to contract not only for the purpose of treatment but equally for the purpose of custody, care, subsistence, education, and training of state prisoners.

speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="1857.204" stopTime="1944.482">
    Ms. Barbara E. Etkind 
    Well, there are a couple of answers to that. 
    One is that the description of treatment facilities is merely, the use of "treatment facilities" is merely a correct description of the federal facilities, the federal prisons, because what we have are treatment facilities. 
    To be sure, other federal statutes refer to prisons as penal and correctional institutions, but those provisions were passed, not only were passed by Congresses other than that which passed 5003, but they concern the operation and management of federal prisons as institutional entities rather than the slots within them that may be available for the housing of state prisoners. 
    And finally, even if the phrase, 5003 still requires no more than a certification that facilities are available, presumably in the case that the prisoner would need them. 
    But nothing in the statutory language suggests that the Director must make an individualized determination in the case of each potential state transferee that he needs specialized treatment available in the federal system and that specific treatment facilities have been earmarked for him. 
    Our argument is not merely as petitioner misconceives it, that Section 5003(a) contains no implied right of action in favor of state prisoners, but rather--

    Well, the legislative history of 4001(a) is very specific. 
    That statute was passed in connection with the repeal of the emergency, the Internal Security Act, a provision that allowed citizens to be rounded up and detained if there was just probable cause to believe that they were engaged in some sort of illegal activity without conviction. 
    And the legislative history makes quite clear that 4001 was enacted in order to provide that citizens would not have to be afraid of that.

    Except that the legislative history makes clear that the persons for whom they were concerned and to whom they wanted to give a right of action were those that were being detained without conviction only upon a probable cause of engaging in some sort of illegal activity. 
    We've addressed that in our brief, I believe it's page 25, Note 13. 
    Section 5003 does not provide, as petitioner would have it, that no state prisoner may be transferred to the federal prison system unless the Director certifies that he is in need of specialized treatment available in the federal system. 
    Rather, the only condition imposed under Section 5003(a)'s broad authority to contract, apart from the reimbursement requirement, is that the Director have certified that proper and adequate treatment facilities and personnel are available. 
    That certification nowhere requires that an individualized determination of treatment need and available federal resources be made with respect to each potential state transferee.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2196.474" stopTime="2250.968">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let's assume that a state, a given state, not Vermont, had a provision in its criminal statutes governing its institutions, that any prisoners on coming in would be examined and classified, and if they were found to have particular problems, for example, alcoholism and emotional disorders, then the statute would provide in that state, shall receive treatment for such condition. 
    Now, could that prisoner be transferred to a federal institution absent a certification by someone that treatment was available? 
    In other words, absent that situation, they would not be complying with the state statute.
speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="2250.968" stopTime="2258.730">
    Ms. Barbara E. Etkind

    Did not use that.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2263.431" stopTime="2283.798">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    --I would think must be assumed to have taken into account that perhaps some states do require some kind of treatment. 
    And, of course, it's well known that all the federal prisons do provide some forms of treatment. 
    Would you think that might have been in the contemplation of Congress in drafting that?
speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="2283.798" stopTime="2452.949">
    Ms. Barbara E. Etkind 
    No, no, I don't think so. 
    To go to the legislative history, what Congress's basic underlying motive, intent, was, was to match the needs of the states with the surpluses of the Federal Government, whatever they might be at that time. 
    The requests that the Bureau of Prisons had been getting was for space in the federal system for juveniles and for drug addicts, and we had that space available and so we determined to make that available. 
    But in a gross sense the intent of Congress was not to limit it in that way, it was just to make what we had available to the states. 
    Although we view the statutory language as unambiguous resort to the legislative history demonstrates, as I said, that the intent was to match the states' needs with federal surpluses. 
    The petitioner's construction would frustrate that intent by preventing the Federal Government, even when it has the necessary surpluses, from meeting the urgent needs of the state correctional system. 
    The Bureau's construction of Section 5003 has permitted it to accept custody of nearly 172 New Mexico prisoners who were displaced by the massive disruption in that state's penitentiary on February 2 and 3, 1980. 
    Similarly, pursuant to its broad construction of Section 5003, the Bureau assumed custody of 111 Idaho state prisoners after riots occurred in that state's maximum security facility on July 23, 1980. 
    And more recently, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland ordered the Maryland prison system to transfer 100 of its inmates to the federal system in order to partially relieve the state system's overcrowding problem. 
    None of those emergency relocations would be possible under petitioner's cramped construction of the statute, nor would the federal system be authorized to afford protective custody to a state prisoner who was in danger from his fellow state inmates or to accept custody of any state prisoner regardless of how much he could benefit from or indeed desires certain aspects of federal incarceration, unless such a prisoner was otherwise in need of specialized treatment available in the federal system. 
    As the court below put it, adopting petitioner's view of the statute would mean that a wholly incorrigible prisoner or on the other hand a fully rehabilitated prisoner incarcerated not for treatment but solely for purposes of deterrence could not be transferred from state to federal custody solely to take advantage of training and educational opportunities available only at federal facilities.

    Ms. Barbara E. Etkind 
    Well, the legislative history doesn't indicate that we were developing them at that time. 
    I think it indicates and I think it's clear that we had them at those times. 
    As of mid-December, 1980, the entire federal system was slightly short of its rated physical capacity. 
    And to the extent that such surplus federal facilities can be used to alleviate the state's problems, be they lack of maximum security facilities, lack of treatment programs, or overcrowding in general, we submit that the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 5003 would be furthered. 
    And this shows that from the enactment of Section 5003 to the present, the Bureau of Prisons consistently has maintained the view that we urge here, that there are no limitations on the purposes for which state prisoners may be transferred to the federal system, that simple custody is a sufficient reason. 
    Indeed, in its first annual report after the passage of Section 5003 in 1952, the Bureau suggested as examples of situations in which the transfer provision might be employed, those in which 
    "a state may wish to transfer a vicious, intractable offender who cannot be handled readily in its own institutions, or a female prisoner for whom appropriate facilities are not available. " 
    We submit that considerable deference is due such a contemporaneous and consistent interpretation of the statute by the agency that drafted the legislation, suggested its enactment to Congress, and has been charged with its administration ever since. 
    I'd like to rely on our arguments in our brief with respect to the second two points, unless there are any questions from the Court. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. John J. Easton, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think above all else this case is not merely a case of statutory construction but it involves the ability of Vermont and similar states to provide a dignified and humane approach to dealing with those who run afoul of the law. 
    Maybe stated differently, the question is, may Vermont continue to operate a community-based correction system where offenders, more than 95 percent of those housed in Vermont, where they have the right to be integrated back into the community. 
    Or must we return to the conditions that existed in 1974, when we decided to close down the maximum security prison, when we were spending a full 25 percent of our resources on two percent of those incarcerated? 
    I think that's really the issue.

    Mr. John J. Easton, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    It's a private institution. 
    I guess the thrust of my argument is that the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which has been described as, in fact, I think, in one of the Lono opinions as one of the best penal systems in the world, that having that available to us for the five percent of those prisoners who need the facilities enables us to have a community-based correction system to care for the remaining 95 percent of those who can be integrated back into our community. 
    We're talking, in a state like Vermont, of a very small correctional system. 
    We have less than 500 prisoners. 
    We have 3,700 probationers. 
    Our whole corrections population is smaller than the size of several state institutions. 
    Our system consists of six facilities around the state, four community correction centers and two state-wide centers. 
    The largest only has a capacity of less than 150. 
    All the rest are under 100. 
    These are--

    Mr. John J. Easton, Jr. 
    --As the court below found, Justice Stevens, even if some of the same activities and programs were available in Vermont, they're less accessible to Mr. Howe because of his need for maximum security incarceration. 
    We literally do not have the ability on the long-term basis to house a prisoner of this sort, and so therefore, while there may be some programs that are parallel from our system into the federal system, for a prisoner who is there on a long-term basis, who presents a maximum security risk, as Mr. Howe did, then they're far less accessible. 
    I think it's interesting, it's contained in the petition of certiorari in Hawaii v. Mederios, the finding of the magistrate in Illinois who said the states are literally faced with the unenviable position of having, if the returned prisoners like this are returned to the states, then they're placed in conditions that literally are inhumane and they'd be making arguments for Eighth Amendment freedom, or the states have to release them. 
    So, it puts us in a very untenable position if we do not have the freedom and flexibility to contract with the Federal Government for this type of prisoner.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you think Vermont can't make some other entity a surrogate, including a private corporation? 
    Suppose some group of people got together, penologists in the universities, set up a private, nonprofit corporation to do better than most of the penal institutions do, much like setting up the postal corporation outside of the old system, do you say that Vermont could not incarcerate its prisoners in that kind of an institution?

    Two hundred yards down the road or 2,000 miles away in Alaska, or 3,000 miles.
speaker="william_a_nelson" startTime="3531.717" stopTime="3680.235">
    Mr. William A. Nelson 
    I can't point to anything in Vermont law which would prohibit that but I don't feel confident in saying that it would be authorized either. 
    It seems fishy, on the face of it. 
    It's not... the statutes which empower the Vermont Commissioner of Corrections to incarcerate people speak of incarceration generally within the state. 
    A particular statute was passed to permit incarceration in the federal system as a reciprocal act to 5003. 
    If Vermont were able without such a statute to designate another agent to incarcerate its prisoners, then the Vermont reciprocal statute would not have been necessary. 
    I want to address the agency interpretation argument which was presented by the Solicitor General. 
    In the first place, we think that the agency's interpretation is entitled to weight only if it's reasonable. 
    In this case we don't think it's even reasonable. 
    The circuit reached its decision, the circuit said that it was construing the statute as it did, not quite at face value. 
    The district court reached the decision it did, indications in the legislative history to the contrary notwithstanding. 
    Both of these sources, as well as the context of other statutes in which 5003 sits, indicate that the agency's current interpretation is simply not reasonable, not merely that it's not preferable. 
    Secondly, the agency interpretation has varied. 
    The original agency interpretation, after all, was a letter submitted to the judiciary committees of both House and Senate stating that federal facilities were needed for specialized cases, that there were requests received for specialized cases. 
    This, I think, is an agency interpretation made directly to a house of Congress. 
    The formal agency interpretation of this statute is contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, and it simply tracks the statutory language. 
    It does not omit the treatment facilities and personnel requirement.
