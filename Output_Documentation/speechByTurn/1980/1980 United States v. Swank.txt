    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    These three cases are here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims. 
    They involve an important question of taxation in the mineral area, as to which there is a conflict of decisions in the lower courts. 
    Specifically, the question presented is whether a provision in a mineral lease permitting the lessor to terminate the lease on 30 days' notice without any cause deprives the lessee of an economic interest in the minerals in place so that the lessee is not entitled to the depletion deduction permitted under Section 611(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The facts of all three cases are virtually identical and can be summarized briefly as follows: respondents are all direct--

    Principally, the respondents are all lessees under coal leases and as under these leases they were authorized to remove coal, in consideration of a stated royalty per ton. 
    The leases each permitted respondents to sell coal, the coal that was extracted, to anyone at any price.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    No, we don't concede that point, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and we think it's a little late in the day for the Respondent Swank to be raising it, because while... may I refer the Court to pages 54a and 55a of the Appendix, which discusses this problem and specifically paragraph (c) on page 55a which says: 
    "Statements to the effect that Northumberland County would not terminate a lease except for cause were made to various individual mine operators including taxpayer, in public meetings of the commissioners, and reported in the press. " 
    But then it goes on to say, and this is from the stipulation of facts: 
    "However, no assurance was given that the county commissioners could not cancel a lease without cause. " 
    I think that the Court of Claims assumed for purposes of its decision that the Swank lease was a termination without cause. 
    Respondent Swank never took exception to that finding and I think that for purposes... as the case comes here, I think that is agreed, that must be agreed, that the Swank lease as well as the Bull Run and Black Hawk lease all provided for termination without cause.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    We wouldn't be here on that... because if the lease were terminated for cause... and in fact, there were other provisions of these leases that were terminable, because, for example, if the respondents didn't pay their rent or their royalties, the leases were terminable. 
    We're not contending that that deprives the lessee of the depletion deduction. 
    In any event, each lease provided, as I said, that the lessor could terminate without cause on 30 days' notice, and it was on this basis that the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the respondents' depletion deductions on the ground that none of the respondents had an economic interest in the minerals covered by their leases. 
    The Court of Claims decided otherwise on the authority of its earlier decision in Bakertown Coal Company, which essentially presents the same question.

    And this is a classic statement in the depletion area because what it did was, to permit lessees like an operator in this situation, but announced that if the lease... the lease had to be for more than a nominal period. 
    It could only be terminable on more than nominal notice, and the Service announced in that case that generally one year was the rule. 
    And in fact, the Service has ruled subsequently, more recently... as a matter of fact, I can cite the Court to two Revenue Rulings that I think bring this matter up to date: Revenue Ruling 74-506 and 74-507, which were cited at 1974-2, Cumulative Bulletin 178 and 179, which more or less reaffirmed the one-year rule.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    Well, I'd like to... I would not stand here and tell you that this was an overwhelming important question of tax policy, except to the extent that the Bar and the Treasury depend upon the application of uniform rules, and we think that the uniform rule in this case ought to be that the termination clause should be regarded as a powerful right against which all other rights must be subordinated. 
    And indeed, this concept is not foreign to the tax law. 
    Although the respondent suggests that this is a terrible thing that the Treasury is imposing upon this in the area of trusts, in the area of estate taxes, the right to revoke or the right to pull back something is extremely important, and we submit that here, where the lessor has the right to cancel a lease without any cause at all, essentially saying, get out in 30 days, really reduces these respondents to having nothing more than a right to mine an additional 30 days of coal.

    The owners in those cases will get 631(c) capital gains treatment, which is a special provision in the Code only for coal and iron ore, and it's really quite beneficial, and it's really hard, it's really hard to accept the force of the Court of Claims' point on that.

 Suppose it were held that this lessee here did have an economic interest in the minerals in place, my experience always was that the depletion allowance is going to go to one or the other but not to both.

    In fact, I don't think they could, because I think that the transaction would still fit Section 631(c). 
    It would be a transfer with a retained economic interest. 
    And as I understand the matter, the owners have their overriding royalty is a retained economic interest. 
    They would continue to get capital gains treatment on their royalties. 
    They get capital gains treatment no matter how the Court decides.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    It would have, in my view, no effect on the landlord, because this still would be a Section 631(c) case. 
    The other thing really involved in this case is whether the lessee is eligible for percentage depletion. 
    The lessor, because of the peculiar... Section 631(c) is not elective and if you make a transfer like that in the coal area, you are not eligible for percentage depletion. 
    The statute is clear on that. 
    It's a special benefit for transfers of coal deposit... you know, interests in coal deposits and more or less, as I understand it, is a trade-off that says, you don't get percentage depletion on your overriding royalties the way you would if you were in oil or a variety of other minerals but you'll get capital gains treatment and, you know, correspondingly, cost depletion.

    Well, getting back to what I think is sort of germane here, and that is, on the question of the importance of the terminability provision, in Parsons, like this case, there were clear and explicit termination clauses in the contracts. 
    But in Paragon, the importance of terminability to the Court was so significant that the Court implied a termination right on the behalf of the lessors, on the fact that the contractors could have walked off at any time.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    Well, that is true, that is true, because... exactly. 
    But in our view, and I think that, really, this is the important thing, that I couldn't agree with you more, that if you can't sell the coal to anyone you please but you have to sell it to the lessor, you really are a kind of glorified coal miner. 
    But it seems to me that the right of termination on 30 days' notice without cause is an equally important right that subordinates the whole thing, because it basically says, the whole deal, I can nullify the whole deal anytime I want. 
    And it seems to me that if you are operating under those kinds of restraints you don't really have much of a deal anymore than you would if you had to sell the coal to the lessor. 
    It seems to me that both those factors are of equal weight.

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    No. 
    It seems to me that Paragon follows the rule of Parsons. 
    And indeed, that was one of the points I wanted to make. 
    It seems to me that one of the other points that the respondents make and the Court of Claims made is that, well, it's very nice to talk about termination and the terminability, but that's really a wholly theoretical thing and here nobody terminated. 
    What does that matter? 
    It's kind of instructive... I was reading the dissent in Parsons, in Paragon this morning, and the dissent made much the same complaint that the respondents do here in which the Court of Claims... It's incredible that no one has sort of made the analogy that the same complaint... the Court tries to assimilate this case to Parsons by stating that Paragon could have terminated the interest of the operators. 
    But the actual facts are really that Paragon never gave the slightest intimation that it might terminate anyone's contract, and in our view it's the right to terminate that's important, because depletion and the allowances that flow from these mining contracts necessarily have to turn on the rights. 
    The statute has to be administered in accordance with the rights that the parties set forth in their contracts. 
    And, indeed--

    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    --Yes, in our view it does equate. 
    They are equivalents for these purposes. 
    I'm not suggesting that there aren't property law distinctions but I think the Court has said often in this area that property law really has to take a back seat to the governing principles in this area. 
    So, essentially, in our view, these respondent-lessees are much like tenants at sufferance. 
    They can be ejected at any time, and if they are ejected at any time... they can be ejected at any time. 
    Whether in fact they are or they aren't is irrelevant. 
    The essential point is that they don't have an economic interest in coal in place, and if they don't have that they don't get the depletion allowance. 
    I'd like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

    We are exactly at odds with the statements which have been made by the Government in this case. 
    He is wrong in stating that the lessor gets, besides capital gains, gets cost depletion. 
    It's just not true, Your Honors. 
    Section 631 specifically says that the lessor shall no longer get any depletion and in its place the lessor will get capital gains on the royalties which he receives.

    --The intricacies of the market determine whether or not a lessor is going to lease his property to a lessee and what the royalty rate will be. 
    Now, when he has to figure what his capital gain is, he has to figure his cost in exactly the same way that if you bought a piece of machinery and later sold it, to see whether you had a capital gain you have to figure his cost. 
    That is what the Government in its 631(c) statute say, that they must figure their cost and then take capital gains on it.

    Mr. LeRoy Katz 
    --Yes, if, for example, if you had paid for your property $100,000, for example, and then you had a million tons of coal in that property, and then you leased it to a lessee, your unit cost in that is a million divided by a hundred thousand, ten cents; ten cents a ton. 
    And then, if you go from there and see what the lessee, how many tons he mines and the royalty that he gets from that, you can figure what your cost is, and based upon that cost then you determine what your capital gain is. 
    But the important thing is, Your Honor, is that leaves nothing... we do not describe what the lessee is to get. 
    You see, the percentage depletion allowance is based upon gross income from mining. 
    So that means, what is the coal sold for on the market and what did the lessee, who had the absolute right, as soon as he cut that coal out of the mountain and as soon as he brought it in and had it cleaned, he had to sell it; he was responsible for it. 
    He had to take the risk of the loss, he had all of the obligations of an owner. 
    And he had to sell that coal. 
    Now, for example, you give the lessor 25 cents. 
    According to his theory, that's all there is in the way of depletion. 
    Not so. 
    If the lessee sells that coal for, say, $30 a ton, his depletion is based upon that $30 a ton less the 25 cents that he gave to the lessor. 
    Now, that is the depletion that we're talking about. 
    And the Government would say that, no, that's not right. 
    We say it can't be any other way, Your Honors. 
    It cannot be any other way. 
    We have lost the depletion allowance, and we say that nobody... and I repeat, what we're talking about here, and what we have been denied by their appeal... we were granted in the Court of Claims... what we have been denied is the percentage depletion which is based upon the gross income from the mining of that coal, which we did in every taxable year in this case. 
    That includes Swank, that includes Bull Run, and it includes Black Hawk. 
    Now you tell me why we are not entitled to that depletion allowance which the Federal Government, by virtue of this Congress, has given us, and said we are entitled to it? 
    No one else, and I repeat it again, no one else can claim that depletion, and no one else will get it if we don't. 
    And that's true of Swank, of course, because the governmental agency in Northumberland County doesn't have to worry about it. 
    But it is also true in Bull Run and it is true in Black Hawk.

    Mr. LeRoy Katz 
    No, sir, it does not. 
    And assuredly, Your Honor, that under those circumstances we've also got to remember, as far as... the Government in its brief has been arguing that this depletion allowance is what the lessor is entitled to and what he gets. 
    No such thing. 
    He gets no depletion allowance. 
    Now, I also want to call the Court' attention to the fact, to strengthen it, that under the depletion deduction... under Section 611, it says this: 
    "No depletion deduction"... no depletion deduction... 
    "shall be allowed the owner with respect to any coal. " 
    --I'm leaving out the other minerals... 
    "that such owner has disposed of under any form of contract by virtue of which he retains an economic interest in such coal, if such disposal is considered a sale of the coal under Section 631(c). " 
    Now, how he can say that they are going to get some depletion, the owner, under 631 is beyond me, because I'm just reading it right cut of the book.

    Mr. LeRoy Katz 
    --Oh, all right. 
    Anyhow, the contractor in that case was mining the coal for the lessee. 
    He was... he did not depend upon what the lessee got for the coal on the open market. 
    He was paid a certain amount per ton. 
    He was required to bring the coal to the lessee's tipple. 
    He was required to give it to the lessee who then in turn sold it, and who was responsible for what happened on the market, whether he made money or whether he lost money. 
    And as a result of that, the contractor, this Court said, was not entitled to any depletion allowance. 
    They didn't base it on the terminability. 
    He had no economic interest in the coal in place, because all he was doing was getting paid for work which he performed and before he walked into that mine he knew exactly how much he was going to get for every ton of coal he pulled out, irrespective of what the lessee, Paragon, got in that case. 
    Now, that's the difference. 
    But, now, here the Government has conceded that we have a valid lease. 
    The Government concedes that absent this termination clause, that we had all the rights, all the privileges, all of the duties of any lessee. 
    In the case of Black Hawk, we had to even have a minimum royalty. 
    We had to pay $5,000 a year whether we mined a ton of coal or not.

    Mr. LeRoy Katz 
    All right, sir, in the case of Black Hawk, we mined it for 13 years, to exhaustion. 
    We mined every drop of coal out. 
    In the case of Bull Run, they mined it for 11 years, and mined every drop of coal out, to exhaustion. 
    It just happened that way. 
    In Swank, there were two leases. 
    One, they had to abandon after a year because they had a slide; and the other, they mined for the two years when it was transferred to someone else. 
    But in each of the instances that I have named, we have mined that coal through every tax year. 
    We think this is an important item. 
    The question that we have mined that coal in the tax years in issue, and that's what this case is about, were we entitled to the depletion allowance during the tax years in issue? 
    Well, we mined it. 
    Why shouldn't we get it? 
    It is not like Paragon where in that case two people were claiming the same depletion, the same percentage depletion. 
    The miner, the contract miner said, I am entitled to it on what I got paid, which is $10. 
    We contend that the lessee was entitled to it because he ran the risk of the market, and that he had the economic interest in the coal in place. 
    So, that was the difference between the two, and between what we have here and what we had in Paragon.

    Mr. LeRoy Katz 
    --Yes, that's correct. 
    That is exactly correct. 
    And in this case, it's ten percent, but it's not just ten percent flat. 
    It's ten percent of the gross income not to exceed 50 percent of your net income after you've figured out your net income. 
    So that is what it is. 
    Contrary to what my opponent has stated here, Your Honor, we feel that the percentage depletion allowance should be given, to us. 
    The Government is not injured because the Congress has told us we are entitled to that depletion. 
    Not only that, Your Honor, if I may make this point, it doesn't make any difference whether we mine ten tons or a million tons, is this Court going to get into this debate that we have now in the Tax Court? 
    They have said, no; 30 days is not enough; 60 days is not enough; they have just come out with a case in which they say, well, 120 days is. 
    Now, is this Court going to say, well, we're going to fix a year or five years or six months, is that the job of this Court? 
    Why isn't the Government asking for, one, legislation, or two, to put down some regulations that we know how to follow? 
    And we feel that unless they do that they should not bring us into court every time they decide that they don't want to give out the depletion allowance. 
    We've fought it in Parsons v. Smith. 
    We had to fight in Paragon Jewel. 
    I fought it in Bakertown, to get the depletion to which we were entitled. 
    They did not appeal. 
    And I believe, Your Honors, that we are entitled to that depletion and that it should be granted.

   Rebuttal of Stuart A. Smith
speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="2836.294" stopTime="2893.287">
    Mr. Stuart A. Smith 
    I just have a couple of points. 
    As I understand why the GCM which has been bandied about today has been rendered obsolete, it's simply because it's been subsumed in other authorities including this Court's decisions in Parsons and in Paragon, and in the rulings which I cited today. 
    I don't think that this case can be decided on the basis of notions that Congress enacted the depletion deduction. 
    I think we can all agree on that. 
    I think that what we have to decide is whether these respondents have an economic interest in coal in place. 
    And in our view, they don't have any more than the right to stay there; and they didn't have any more than a right to stay there, more than an additional 30 days. 
    And in our view, that is not significant enough to have an economic interest in coal in place.
