    Mr. Vogeler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="alan_r_vogeler" startTime="45.608" stopTime="236.312">
    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court: 
    The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company is one of 1,957 legal reserve life insurance companies that as of January 1, 1980, were licensed to do business in one of the states or the District of Columbia. 
    Western and Southern was incorporated as a stock company in 1888 and in 1948 became a mutual company. 
    At January 1 of 1981 it had assets in excess of $3 billion, and life insurance in force of over $14 billion and thus according to Best's Insurance Reports, it ranks 25th in size of companies and 45th of companies in size of life insurance in force. 
    It's licensed to do business in 41 states, including the State of California. 
    It obtained the certificate of authority to do business in California as of July 1, 1956, and has carried on its business under that certificate of authority granted in 1956 for the last 25 years. 
    The California constitutional provisions and the retaliatory tax laws of California, when Western and Southern became qualified to do business there, levied a tax upon out-of-state insurers which was called a retaliatory tax if the state from which the foreign insurer to California came levied a higher tax on California insurers doing business in those foreign states than it did upon its own insurers. 
    And when the State Legislature implemented that statute in 1959, Western and Southern went to court, and it was determined in the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1962 that no retaliatory tax could be assessed against Western and Southern under the California constitutional provision and law then in effect because the State of Ohio did not levy higher taxes on foreign insurance companies doing business in Ohio than they did on foreign insurance companies coming into the State from outside. 
    However, in November, 1964, the California constitution was amended to authorize a retaliatory tax on out-of-state insurers in California merely when the state of origin of that insurance company levied a tax on foreign insurance companies that was higher than California levied.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Now, in using this term retaliatory throughout, how would you distinguish that from the traditional reciprocity statute?
speaker="alan_r_vogeler" startTime="245.449" stopTime="258.585">
    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    Reciprocity, Your Honor, is a situation in which one state recognizes and defers to legislation or some comity in another state.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="258.585" stopTime="263.660">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, as it's typically, we'll treat your corporations the same way you treat ours, isn't it?
speaker="alan_r_vogeler" startTime="263.660" stopTime="362.933">
    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    That is not what our situation here is, because California does not lower its tax if a foreign state has a lower tax. 
    It merely raised their tax up to a foreign state's tax. 
    There is no reciprocity. 
    But this is what, of course, the Attorney General of California would like this Court to believe. 
    We will expand on the fact that this is not reciprocity, this is not comity. 
    California taxes, whether or not Ohio discriminates on California corporations, and levies a higher tax on the foreign insurance company doing business in California. 
    The California constitutional amendment in 1964 had the effect of levying this tax on out-of-state insurers when the out-of-state, the foreign state of origin of the company doing business in California had a higher tax rate than California did. 
    Now, California's tax rate, actually, is higher than 32 other states. 
    But Ohio's tax rate is higher than California's. 
    So the question of the validity of this California retaliatory tax is therefore at issue in this case. 
    We claim, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court found, that this kind of a tax, which he referred to as a comparative retaliatory tax where the tax burdens of different states were compared, is unconstitutional.

    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The discriminatory tax is one which levies a tax when the foreign state discriminates. 
    The retaliatory tax, the comparative retaliatory tax, is one that is levied when the foreign state merely levies a higher burden. 
    The discriminatory tax is one which is aimed at the foreign state which levies higher taxes on foreign companies than on its own companies. 
    That is the anti-discriminatory retaliatory tax. 
    That is no longer the tax we have in California, Your Honor. 
    We have the comparative tax, the comparative retaliatory tax which merely measures the comparative tax burdens in Ohio and California. 
    And this is the tax which is in effect in most of the states of the Union. 
    We claim that this tax in California is invalid, violating not only the Interstate Commerce Clause, but also the Due Process and Equal Protection of the Law. 
    And this is also what the judge found in the trial court. 
    Now, the Court of Appeal reversed that. 
    The Court of Appeal reversed it on the basis of its understanding of the decisions by this Court in Prudential v. Benjamin and Prudential v. Hobbs.

    It is one tax, Your Honor. 
    It is a retaliatory tax. 
    A return is filed and an amount is paid. 
    It is not the premiums tax which all insurance companies pay. 
    It is not the real property tax, which all of the insurance companies pay. 
    It is a retaliatory tax determined by the use of a retaliatory form which measures the tax burden of California against the tax burden of the state of origin of the incoming company.

    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The Los Angeles Superior Court also found that that was an undue discrimination, it violated due process, and it violated equal protection for the California companies to get this credit against their premiums tax and for a company like Western and Southern who did have an office building... it's a lovely office building on Wilshire Boulevard which it spent a lot of money for and pays a lot of taxes for, but it doesn't get the same credit that the California companies get, because Western and Southern didn't occupy 75 percent of the building, and therefore was limited to a credit equal to the percentage of its real property taxes, equal to the percentage of the building occupied by itself. 
    Now, as Mr. Justice Blackmun has stated, the Court of Appeal of California reversed the Los Angeles County Superior Court, and it is the validity of that reversal which we are concerned with today. 
    Now, the legal issues we think are twofold. 
    One, did this Court in Prudential Insurance Company v. Benjamin and Prudential Insurance Company v. Hobbs in 1945 give free rein in 1946 to the states to levy whatever burden they wanted to on insurance companies doing business in interstate commerce? 
    And if that question is answered in the affirmative, then did those two cases also authorize the states to violate the due process of law and equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution?

    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but this Court has said it has not done that in McCarran-Ferguson Act. 
    There isn't any question that the trial court found this California retaliatory tax to be discriminatory, and nobody says that it isn't discriminatory. 
    Neither the appellee, the Attorney General of California, nor any of the amici on their side say that this isn't discriminatory. 
    What they say is that this Court authorized this discrimination when it interpreted the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1946. 
    Now, what they say really is that this type of discrimination was approved by this Court in Hobbs, Prudential Insurance Company v. Hobbs. 
    Now, the Hobbs case, decided on June 10, '46, before any of the members of this Court had come to the Court either as Justices or as clerks, said as follows: 
    "The entire case #"--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="774.390" stopTime="775.953">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But not long, though.
speaker="alan_r_vogeler" startTime="775.953" stopTime="892.062">
    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    --A couple of years. 
    "Appeals for the Supreme Court of Kansas. " 
    "June 10, 1946. " 
    "Per curiam, the judgments are affirmed. " 
    "Prudential Insurance Company v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408; Robertson v. California 328 U.S. 440. " 
    That's the entire language of this Court. 
    Now, let's go down below to the Kansas Supreme Court. 
    There were 16 insurance companies who had cases involved in the court entitled, 
    "In re Kansas, in re insurance tax cases, at 160 Kansas 300. " 
    There were three types of taxes involved. 
    They were a fireman's relief fund tax, a premiums tax, and a retaliatory tax. 
    None of the companies subject to the retaliatory tax had qualified to do business in Kansas before the retaliatory tax was enacted. 
    And what did the Kansas Supreme Court say with respect to all of these laws? 
    Here's what they said in their own syllabus: 
    "(1) Our statutes pertaining to insurance were not rendered void by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Southeastern Underwriters Association. " 
    That was their first premise of law. 
    Second, 
    "Congress did not exceed its powers in passing Public Law No. 15 of the 79th Congress, First Session. " 
    "That's the McCarran-Ferguson Act. " 
    And third, 
    "Mandamus will not be allowed to compel an executive officer. " 
    --they wanted a license to be issued. 
    "Mandamus will not be allowed to compel an executive officer to do something contrary to a statute unless it is is clear that the statute is void. " 
    So the memorandum opinion issued by this Court in Hobbs could do no more than affirm the foregoing propositions of law.

    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    There was a retaliatory tax, Your Honor, absolutely. 
    However, the Kansas Supreme Court said in its decision, 
    "We find no evidence that the tax burden on the foreign states doing an insurance business in Kansas are any higher than they are on the Kansas insurance companies who are doing business as native companies. " 
    So there is no retaliation, there is no discrimination... pardon me, Your Honor. 
    There is no discrimination that was found to be existing in the Kansas Supreme Court.

    --What I wanted to say about both Benjamin and Hobbs is that in the Benjamin case we were dealing with a South Carolina premium statute. 
    We were not dealing in Benjamin with a retaliatory statute.

    --That is also true, Your Honor. 
    The doctrine of Lincoln Life Insurance Company v. Read was still in effect, and the question is whether or not a corporation could be charged coming into a state a different fee or a different tax than a creature of that own state. 
    When a company is coming into a state standing on the threshold, it may be valid for a corporate tax to be placed on that corporation which is higher or different from the tax that is levied on the local corporation. 
    Now, we are getting into somewhat of a discussion of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine which this Court I believe is now fostering, and it may be that the Lincoln Life Insurance Company case v. Read may not again be decided in the same way that it was decided at that time. 
    But this is the concept that was involved in the Benjamin case, namely, a company coming into the State of Carolina was subjected to a higher tax than Carolina companies--

    In any event, we suggest that this Court is the final arbiter of the meaning and effect of its decisions. 
    As I say, we believe the California Court of Appeal interpreted Prudential v. Benjamin and Prudential v. Hobbs incorrectly, but if we are wrong we urge this Court to reexamine those cases and to distinguish them on the basis that the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not authorize discriminatory taxation against interstate commerce where such discrimination constitutes a denial of Equal Protection of Laws.

    I feel that if the McCarran-Ferguson Act takes away all protections to foreign insurance companies of the Interstate Commerce Clause, which is what the Attorney General of California would have you say and what you may already have said, then it seems to me it is particularly important that this Court be zealous in reserving and protecting the only remaining rights that there are to these foreign insurance companies under the Constitution, and those are the rights guaranteed to them under the fourteenth Amendment: Due Process, Equal Protection--

    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    No, Your Honor. 
    And that is, of course, one of the things that we discuss here, because we feel that contrary to what the Attorney General would have you believe, and contrary to what the amici in support of the California statute would have you believe, this type of legislation, this retaliatory legislation does not promote comity. 
    It doesn't promote equal-handed treatment, evenhanded treatment. 
    It doesn't promote even taxation of foreign corporations. 
    Let's look at the California law. 
    They say that 17 states only levy higher taxes on foreign insurance companies than California, and therefore it indicates that there's a great leveling of taxes on foreign corporations. 
    But 31 states levy a lower tax on foreign insurance companies than California does, so that when those companies which are created in California come into any one of the other 32 states they have a retaliatory tax to pay. 
    So there's nothing magic about what California's doing. 
    The only time you've got comity is because you've got Oklahoma. 
    In Oklahoma that's the highest tax of all, four percent. 
    So every Oklahoma company that does business in any other state pays a retaliatory tax. 
    In California, Western and Southern pays a tax of the difference between 2.35, the California rate, and the Ohio rate, 2.5, or 0.15 of a percent of their premium income. 
    Oklahoma pays a 1.65 percent, companies from Oklahoma pay a 1.65 percent of premium tax, eleven times what Ohio pays.

    The due process argument, Your Honor, emphasizes that the mere incorporation of a state in another state is no warrant or authority for the imposition of discriminatory taxation. 
    And you, Mr. Justice Brennan, said that yourself in the Allied Stores case and I think your language discussed the matter of our federalism, the comity that we have between states, and you said, our Constitution is an instrument of federalism. 
    You referred to the common and continuing problem of constitutional interpretation, of adjusting the demands of individual states to regulate and tax enterprises in light of the multi-state nature of our federation. 
    The Equal Protection Clause, among its other roles, operates to maintain this principle of federalism. 
    And you pointed out that the Wheeling Steel case held a tax law unconstitutional because it discriminated against an out-of-state company, whereas the Allied Stores case was held valid because Ohio was discriminating against its own citizens in favor of a foreign corporation.

   Argument of Timothy G. Laddish
speaker="timothy_g_laddish" startTime="1707.624" stopTime="1908.653">
    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think first we should clear the record as to one question which I do not think is determinative of this case or actually, strictly relevant to the case. 
    But it's been raised many times by the other side and in an effort to apparently color the case in the favor of Western and Southern, and that is the question as to whether Ohio law itself discriminates against foreign insurers. 
    Now, from the presentation we have heard today and the presentation in the briefs, one would understand that Ohio does not discriminate against out-of-state insurers when they come in. 
    This is not the case. 
    I would draw attention to the brief filed by the American Insurance Association and their fellow associations, and particularly the Appendix A of that brief. 
    There is set forth the Ohio statutes which set forth what Mr. Vogeler has characterized as this complex formula as far as Ohio domestic insurers. 
    It's clear, as Mr. Vogeler says, that foreign insurance companies coming into Ohio will be taxed at a rate of 2.5 percent of their premiums' measure. 
    That's certainly clear under Section 5729.03. 
    That's on page 2a of this Appendix. 
    For domestic insurers Sections 5725.18 and.19 cover the tax that is to be charged. 
    There there is a choice excuse me, it's not a choice; there are alternatives given as far as how the tax will be computed for an Ohio insurance company. 
    One of those alternatives is the alternative, the only basis upon which California companies or any other state's companies will be taxed. 
    It works out so that if you multiply the revenue, the premiums measured by the 8-1/3 figure that's given in subparagraph (b) of 5725.18, multiply the premiums measure by that 8-1/3, and then multiply that result again by the.03 that is given in the 5725.19, you end up with exactly the same 2.5 percent rate that's charged out-of-state insurers. 
    That's only one of the alternatives that's given to the domestic companies. 
    5725.18 says you shall take the lesser of two alternatives. 
    The other alternative is based on the surplus and capital of the company. 
    You arrive at a figure and multiply that by the.03 that is given in Section 5725.19.

    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    There has not been a change in the Ohio tax since the current California retaliatory tax statutes came into effect. 
    Now, whether it has kept the lid on and kept Ohio from doing more and increasing its insurance tax rate, I would say that's a very, very good question as to whether or not Ohio's insurance tax rate on foreign companies might be quite a bit greater.

    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    Well, excuse me, Your Honor, I sprang to that answer. 
    What I mean is, I do not think that discrimination, internal discrimination in the other state, is necessary to support a tax such as ours. 
    There are these other issue, Your Honor, other than just the reducing. 
    The point I... and I'll get off this now, as far as the Ohio taxes go, the Court is... the past practice of the Court has been to take judicial notice of matters in appeals from state courts that that state appellate court could take judicial notice of, and in the current case, I would cite the Court to Section 452(a) for taking judicial notice of the... this is Evidence Code of the State of California... taking judicial notice of the Ohio laws, and also Section 452 (c) which permits California courts to take judicial notice of the official acts of the executive department of the states involved. 
    I mention that one because the amicus, American Insurance Association, has also lodged with the Court in this document the tax forms upon which the examiner for the Superintendent of Insurance of Ohio, pursuant to the Ohio statute, to 5725.9, has computed Western and Southern's tax liabilities for the past few years. 
    If one follows through this form, one will easily see that Western and Southern itself has paid only 36 percent of the taxes due Ohio that a California company would pay to Ohio under the basic Ohio insurance tax. 
    Now, Western and Southern has mentioned in its briefs the stipulation that we reached as to these earlier California trial court decisions about Ohio law. 
    I would just merely point out that the mechanics of the California retaliatory tax means that those decisions were reached on the basis of the level of business Western and Southern was doing in California at that time, and presumably this lower alternative was not available to Western and Southern, would not be available to Western and Southern under those facts for years 1959 and 1960. 
    Until now there's been nothing in the record to show any later years after 1960. 
    Now, I'll move on from what I have said that's irrelevant to begin with. 
    The purpose of the California retaliatory tax is not to raise revenue. 
    That, as the California courts have recognized, is purely incidental. 
    Any revenue that is raised is purely incidental. 
    In fact, the more successful the tax is... as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out... the less revenues will be raised in that if it were successful those foreign taxes will tend to lower. 
    Now, that is true because the true purpose, which is a multi-faceted purpose of this tax, is to help California insurance companies attain evenhanded tax treatment when they do business in the other states. 
    If this is fully achieved, everyone's tax level will be the same--

    --Right now I am trying to... I will tie in all the rules. 
    I really would... I'm presenting in abstract what the purpose is and what the mechanics are. 
    And I think if we understand that, then the constitutional rules and standards are easily applied to show the constitutionality of the tax. 
    The purpose that I mentioned as fully achieved... if it is, then there is no retaliatory tax collectible, and I would point out that the California premiums tax, the basic tax California applies to all insurers would only have to be raised 0.01 percent from 2.35 percent to 2.36 percent in order to take up the slack, if the retaliatory tax were repealed. 
    So the revenue is purely incidental. 
    The further purposes of the tax are to counteract discrimination between... internal discrimination of other states that California companies might experience, such as could be experienced in Ohio. 
    They are to encourage... retaliatory taxes are to encourage uniformity of tax burdens throughout the United States and thus to encourage interstate insurance commerce. 
    Now, this is not the purpose that one normally finds behind a state tax, although as pointed out in the briefs there are other state statutes and there are federal statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that have similar purposes. 
    The existence of that purpose as being the valid purpose in this case and the relative effectiveness with which it is carried out is demonstrated here by who is supporting the State of California in this case as to the insurance tax that is at issue.

    Well, it certainly will become clear when we get to the equal protection argument, Your Honor, and also it is I think quite important here because I don't know if your reaction was the same as mine when I first heard of the California retaliatory tax. 
    It was imposed upon some foreign insurers and not upon California insurers. 
    My reaction was, that sounds like it might be a rather touchy issue. 
    I am trying to show that the retaliatory tax is in fact an equalizing tax. 
    It does have reciprocal... reciprocity elements, very strong reciprocity elements. 
    It does have this purpose that it is not a revenue purpose. 
    Now, as I was pointing out, the states have joined us... Tennessee; Arizona; Wisconsin, as you might expect; New York has come in against us for reasons I will mention in a little bit. 
    But very significant and emphatic amicus support comes to the State for this state tax by the nationwide insurance industry. 
    The bulk of the life insurers the bulk of the property and casualty insurers and the largest casualty, property and casualty insurer in the United States, have all come in in favor of this state tax, which to me illustrates that they recognize that the elimination of this tax will indeed disrupt the relative uniformity that we now have amongst state tax burdens in the insurance area, and will soon result... if the retaliatory tax were to to be abolished... in a significant increase in their tax bills.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I see no reason why it would not. 
    The appellant has tried to indicate that since we reimposed the retaliatory tax after appellant received an indefinite term of a license to do business, that that might somehow distinguish. 
    I'm sure that attempt at distinguishing this case would fall by the wayside soon if this Court were to knock down the California tax. 
    It's clear that this tax conforms with all constitutional standards, and it's also clear that the California license involved was conditioned upon continuing to conform with the law.

    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    --It depends on exactly what we're grouping in the McCarran Act milieu there. 
    I think it's important to remember that with the Commerce Clause not applying in this area, then if these California insurance companies are to avoid this sort of discriminatory taxes that this Court affirmed in Prudential v. Benjamin, where it assumed that the tax was discriminatory against interstate commerce, if they're going to try and keep a lid on that it's going to be up to the states to do it. 
    And it's important to realize that this does create a special context even in the equal protection issue in that if the Equal Protection Clause is seen as having a federalistic element, this is a tax that is trying to keep that sort of discrimination and an overburdening of the insurance industry down.

    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    --I don't see any difference, Your Honor, between saying you have to take this exam, and saying you have to take a six-hour exam. 
    I think if two people walk in, one from West Virginia and one from Colorado, and the Clerk was there and says, let's see your law. 
    You have to take the exam; you don't have to take the exam. 
    I think it's exactly the same sort of point we have here. 
    It is also the same concern and same purpose and same sort of mechanisms that you have in the federal cases, or federal statutes, under the Internal Revenue Code where there are at least five statutes set forth in the American Insurance Association brief that indicate that if you... that as to foreign countries, other sovereigns, the Congress by imposing burdens or withholding benefits... they go both ways on those statutes... they attempt to achieve evenhanded tax treatment for those U.S. citizens and corporations under the other sovereign's laws and they're... although these are set forth, by the way, at pages 23 though 26 of the American Insurance Association brief. 
    There the equal protection standards under the Fifth Amendment would apply to the Federal Government giving the rights to aliens and yet the Federal government has done this. 
    One of the statutes in original form was enacted in 1918, and the Federal Government in at least one of those statutes, 896(b), talks about... excuse me; it was 896(a)... is triggered by exactly the same thing, more burdensome taxes, not discrimination or anything else, but more burdensome taxes. 
    Another one of the statutes, 896(b), is the result or the action as being, we will impose the same tax that you're imposing on our people. 
    So we have other sections and other statutes, including these federal statutes in the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The mechanics of the tax, I think, are relatively simple. 
    We take... and this is what happened in this case. 
    Western and Southern is an Ohio corporation, and so once the California basic premiums tax liability is computed, we look to Ohio and see what a California company doing the level of business done by Western and Southern in California and doing the same type of business, being the same type of company as Western and Southern, what its burden in Ohio would be. 
    Now, if that burden is less or the same, there is no retaliatory tax on Western and Southern. 
    If that burden is more, which the record is clear and there's no dispute here, the Ohio burden would be more on the California company, then there is the tax, but only to the extent that the burden would be more. 
    If Western and Southern were to convince Ohio to lower the burden on the California insurers say to the... or give the California insurers the same alternatives that they're giving to the domestic insurers in Ohio, then the California retaliatory tax, as long as that Ohio burden was the same or below what California's burden would be, would disappear. 
    And I say this is reciprocal action.

    Mr. Timothy G. Laddish 
    --Well, they could. 
    But, Your Honor, remember we have 96 percent of the states having the same retaliatory taxes. 
    Now, if I could just run through, as far as the constitutional standards that need to be applied, Western and Southern and its supporters have often cited authorities from the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    Now, obviously, those do not apply here; we're dealing with a corporation. 
    As to the Commerce Clause, I submit that Prudential v. Benjamin is entirely clear, the McCarran Act is entirely clear, and the application of Prudential and the McCarran Act to a substantially similar retaliatory tax is clear through the decision in Prudential v. Hobbs. 
    So I leave to my briefs the arguments as to the Commerce clause, unless there are questions of the Court. 
    One point is that Congress, if it were unhappy with the Prudential v. Benjamin case or Hobbs case, or if it were unhappy with what the states were doing now as to retaliatory taxes, could change the system at any time by amending the McCarran Act or repealing it, or taking over the field itself of state regulation and taxation of insurance companies. 
    This has not happened. 
    As to the Equal Protection Clause, we have a valid state purpose. 
    I don't think anybody would contest the fact that the purpose I have outlined is a valid purpose.

    I think, as I have pointed out with Mr. Justice Stevens, that the context of the McCarran Act is quite important. 
    But here, with the Equal Protection Clause, you have the purpose and you have the classification, which is certainly reasonably related to the attaining of that purpose. 
    This is not a classification where all foreign insurers are lumped together and suffer discrimination.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There has been no claim that this is in the special level. 
    Here only those companies whose home states would discriminate or would raise a higher burden against California insurers will suffer the retaliatory tax. 
    And as soon as that burden is adjusted down to the California level, the retaliatory tax will disappear.

speaker="alan_r_vogeler" startTime="3653.155" stopTime="3743.805">
    Mr. Alan R. Vogeler 
    Thank you. 
    First, let me say that if we are in error about the Ohio law not discriminating against foreign corporations, it is an error that has been propounded by the California courts which on three different occasions in suits to levy taxes upon Western and Southern because of the Ohio law, found that the Ohio law did not discriminate, and those cases are referred to in our brief. 
    Now, I don't know what the purpose is for talking about Western and Southern's income taxes are, and the materials which has been submitted by the brief for the property insurers are obviously not Western and Southern tax returns but they are work-ups from, perhaps those returns, by employees of the Ohio Department of Insurance. 
    The question of discrimination is obvious in this legislation. 
    Not only do we have discrimination between states, we have discrimination within states. 
    For example, under the California retaliatory tax law a life insurance company from Virginia doing business in California pays no retaliatory tax at all, but a property insurance company from Virginia doing business in California pays a 0.4 percent of premium retaliatory tax. 
    Is that equal protection?

    Now what interest does the State of California have as to what a tax levy is in the State of Ohio? 
    I say to you that no state should have to conform its own revenue statutes to the configuration of another state. 
    And this Court has said so also, in Austin v. New Hampshire. 
    No state should try to impose its insurance tax structure on another state. 
    A state should be free to levy its insurance taxes on insurance companies in accordance with its own needs, not because the State of California wants to equalize the taxes all over the country, or wants to equalize taxes among companies that are going to be doing business there but are from California. 
    The discrimination inherent in retaliatory taxation found to exist in the unchallenged findings of the Superior Court of California that it is unconstitutional should be upheld by this Court. 
    It is fundamentally wrong.
