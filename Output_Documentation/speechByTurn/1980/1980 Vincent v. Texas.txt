Vincent v. Texas
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="21.743">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the disposition to announce in Vincent against Texas in an opinion filed with the clerk this morning. 
    We hold that the appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas must be dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question and it is so ordered.
