    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. 
    The issue involves the construction of Section 38 U.S.C. 2021(b)(3), a section of what are commonly known as the veterans's reemployment rights provisions. 
    This section, enacted in 1968, provides that reservists 
    "shall not be denied retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the armed forces. " 
    The facts of this case are as follows. 
    Petitioner is employed at respondent's refinery in Lima, Ohio. 
    This refinery operates around the clock, seven days a week, three eight-hour shifts per day. 
    Each employee works five days per week for a total of 40 hours, according to a rotating shift schedule that is established by the respondent. 
    During 1975 and 1976 petitioner was a member of a reserve component of the armed forces, which entailed certain training obligations. 
    As a general rule he was required to train with his unit on one weekend per month. 
    In establishing the shift schedule, respondent took no cognizance of petitioner's training obligations and therefore petitioner was frequently scheduled to work on weekend days that conflicted with his training obligations. 
    Thus, unless he was able to arrange a voluntary exchange of shifts with a fellow employee, petitioner was unable to work 40 hours during those weeks, and respondent made other arrangements for other employees to substitute for him. 
    As a result, petitioner lost 192 hours of work and salary over a 15-month period. 
    Now, the parties entered into a stipulation in the district court and stipulated that respondent took no steps to provide petitioner with any work hours during these weeks to substitute for those lost as a result of his military obligations. 
    Petitioner brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that Respondent's failure to attempt to accommodate his reserve obligations violated his statutory rights guaranteed by Section 2021(b)(3). 
    Based upon a stipulated set of facts the district court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment. 
    The court held that respondent had denied the petitioner the right to a 40-hour week, an incident or advantage of employment under the Act by refusing to take account of his reserve obligations in its scheduling. 
    On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed. 
    The Court of Appeals agreed that the right to be scheduled for a 40-hour work week at respondent's refinery was an incident or advantage of employment within the meaning of the statute. 
    However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court and with other courts of appeals as to the scope of the protection that the statute provides such a benefit. 
    The Court of Appeals held that Section 2021(b)(3) protects reservists only against intentional unequal treatment or on-the-job bias by their employers. 
    However, if a reservist is denied an employment benefit because of the operation of "a facially neutral rule" that is applied uniformly to all employees, in that case, the court held that the statute is not violated. 
    Applying these principles to this case, the court held that respondent had not violated the Act. 
    Petitioner's work schedule was established without regard to his training obligations and his training-related absences were treated just as other nonmilitary absences of another employee would have been treated. 
    Thus, in the view of the Court of Appeals, neutral treatment, not bias, was shown. 
    It is our contention that the principles on which the court based its decision stem from an erroneous interpretation of the statute. 
    Congress did not intend that employers would be permitted blindly to follow rules that, although neutral on their face, have an inevitable adverse effect on reservists not in situations where that adverse impact can be completely eliminated if the employer seeks to accommodate rather than simply ignore the fact of petitioner's reserve obligations.

    Justice Jr. 
    Do you have suggestions, Mr. Horowitz, how do you think the employer should accommodate to satisfy his obligation under the statute?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="333.716" stopTime="339.218">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    You mean, on these specific facts? 
    It depends, on a case by case basis.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="339.218" stopTime="340.620">
    Justice Jr. 
    All right, let's start with these.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="340.620" stopTime="370.905">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Okay, well, first of all, we don't think the actual means of accommodation is really an issue in this case because the record reveals that the employer made no effort to make any arrangements. 
    Often it can be arranged simply by exchanging shifts. 
    For example, in this case, other employees had to take respondent's shift, employees that work on a so-called extra board, and there's nothing in the record that indicates why petitioner couldn't then have taken shifts caused by the extra board employees.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="370.905" stopTime="375.107">
    Justice Jr. 
    Suppose that's tried and that doesn't work, then what? 
    What should the employer do?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="375.107" stopTime="381.361">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    In other words, it's impossible for the employer to accommodate in that sense?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="381.361" stopTime="384.629">
    Justice Jr. 
    At least by that method he can't accommodate him.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="384.629" stopTime="401.090">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, we would also suggest that he should have taken account of these obligations in the schedule itself. 
    In other words, first, have a schedule for petitioner's off weekends, on those weekends when he had military obligations, and then fill in his schedule around that.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="401.090" stopTime="403.876">
    Justice Jr. 
    So that he works five days other than the weekend?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="403.876" stopTime="411.446">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Only in the week that he has the reserve obligations. 
    He would still work the same number of weekends over the course of the year, as everyone else.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="411.446" stopTime="426.306">
    Justice Rehnquist 
    But under your theory, every time that a worker is dissatisfied with the employer's effort to accommodate, it would be a question that would have to be resolved in court, whether there had been good faith effort to accommodate him.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="426.306" stopTime="440.232">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, it's not a question of whether he's dissatisfied with the accommodation. 
    It's a question of whether the benefit is denied to him. 
    Now, if the employer didn't give him a 40-hour work week, for example.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="440.232" stopTime="452.373">
    Justice Rehnquist 
    But you say that it's a very flexible type of thing, that the employer does not have to--
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="452.373" stopTime="490.648">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I don't mean to suggest that the courts... the courts are not going to be overrun by cases now deciding what's reasonable accommodation. 
    There's been a lot of litigation in this area already, and it's always been a dispute over what the meaning of the statute is. 
    There's never been any question in these other cases that the employer couldn't accommodate. 
    In most situations it's no trouble at all. 
    For example, in the 5th Circuit case, in the West case, which we've asserted as directly in conflict with this one, the employer conceded that it was no trouble to arrange the schedule that way. 
    Now, the facts of this case may raise a slightly more difficult question because you have a small plant and it's making--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="490.648" stopTime="495.469">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --And you've also got seven days a week, 24 hours a day, scheduling.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="495.469" stopTime="506.341">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Yes, but the reservist is going to be there for five days, so it's not clear that there's any difficulty in scheduling him for those five days.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="506.341" stopTime="513.431">
    Justice White 
    Well, did the employer treat this reservist like he treated other employees who wanted to be away?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="513.431" stopTime="519.918">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's right. 
    He treated his reserve absences just as if they were personal leaves of absence for whatever reason--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="519.918" stopTime="526.321">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So your submission is that he's not entitled to do that, that he... that the statute puts a--
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="526.321" stopTime="531.273">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --That's right. 
    Congress has enacted a special statute that provides for special treatment of reservists--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="531.273" stopTime="540.062">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --It requires him to treat the reservists more favorably than others, including more favorably with respect to absences?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="540.062" stopTime="545.299">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --I don't think it's a question of treating the reservist more favorably. 
    The end result--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="545.299" stopTime="546.816">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's what I just asked you.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="546.816" stopTime="555.088">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --What we contend is that the employer has to give special treatment to the absences. 
    The statute's not satisfied simply by--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="555.088" stopTime="558.606">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    All right. 
    He is to give more favorable treatment to these absences than to other?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="558.606" stopTime="578.984">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --It's not permitted to treat an absence for reserve duty as if it was any other sort of absence. 
    Now, the bottom line is not more favorable treatment for the reservist. 
    He ends up with the same benefits that all the other employees have. 
    It's just the recognition by Congress that these are absences that the reservists have no control over.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="578.984" stopTime="594.595">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you saying that this statute is comparable to what some states have, with special provisions made for people called for jury service? 
    Is military service in the same ball park as jury service?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="594.595" stopTime="616.859">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I think it's in the same ball park. 
    Congress has specifically put it in a special category. 
    They've asked employers to take certain steps so that people are not, do not automatically lose benefits in their civilian employment because they have to enter into this military service. 
    This is a recognition that military service is important for this country and they want to encourage people to do it, not be discouraged.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="616.859" stopTime="626.964">
    Justice Jr. 
    Are the problems of accommodation, Mr. Horowitz, any different under this statute than under those statutes that the Congress has enacted requiring accommodation of religious preferences?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="626.964" stopTime="655.467">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think it's quite different than under Title VII, because the situation under Title VII, it's a complete anti-discrimination statute that intends to prohibit discrimination against all groups of employees, religious being one. 
    But here there is a specific statute directed at military absences. 
    So I think that there may be some more accommodation required here than there is in the Title VII problem.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="655.467" stopTime="660.870">
    Justice Jr. 
    More required here? 
    Even though that's rather constitutionally based, isn't it, under Title VII?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="660.870" stopTime="663.322">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think the accommodation is just statutorily based.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="663.322" stopTime="668.441">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is that why you don't see TWA v. Hardison as being in your way?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="668.441" stopTime="673.861">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, we think that TWA v. Hardison really has very little to do with this case. 
    First of all--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="673.861" stopTime="674.394">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is that the reason?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="674.394" stopTime="712.053">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Well, for several reasons. 
    One, the statute is completely different. 
    The purposes of the statute are quite different. 
    I mean, here you have a specific statute aimed at a particular group of employees. 
    There you have complete anti-discrimination. 
    Now, you have to recognize, in Hardison the employee himself was asking for preferential treatment. 
    He didn't want to work on any Saturdays at all, so he was asking for a schedule that was better than what the other employees were entitled to, even though those employees had greater seniority. 
    Now, here, the respondent's just asking for an opportunity to work. 
    And the schedule is going to end up being the same, in the final analysis.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="712.053" stopTime="715.838">
    Justice White 
    The statute doesn't say anything about rescheduling, does it?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="715.838" stopTime="717.623">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="717.623" stopTime="741.655">
    Justice White 
    It does give him, certainly, something other employees don't have. 
    He can be away for reserve duty and still maintain his seniority and other things, so certainly there is a statute here directed to reservists, but... It specifically says what the employer may not deprive him of, but it doesn't say anything about his having to change his shifts or anything.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="741.655" stopTime="760.217">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, there are two different sections that apply to reservists. 
    One is Section 2024(d), first enacted in 1960, that says that a reservist has a right to a leave of absence when he has reserve duty and when he returns from that leave of absence he's entitled to be restored to his employment with the same seniority, vacation, et cetera.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="760.217" stopTime="762.569">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No question about that being violated?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="762.569" stopTime="793.271">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No question about that being violated here. 
    But Congress had enacted an additional section, several years later, to increase the protection for reservists, and in that section the statutory language is that 
    "the reservist may not be denied retention of employment. " 
    et cetera 
    "or other incident or advantages of employment because of his reserve obligations. " 
    Now, in its literal terms, that statute has been violated here. 
    Both courts found that the right to a 40-hour work week at the refinery was an incident or advantage of employment within the meaning of the statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="793.271" stopTime="795.040">
    Justice White 
    The right to work 40 hours?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="795.040" stopTime="798.592">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Yes. 
    Right to work.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="798.592" stopTime="803.479">
    Justice White 
    Where is the right, where's that in, the source of any right to work 40 hours a week?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="803.479" stopTime="810.300">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    The right to work 40 hours a week is based on the employer's practice at this particular refinery.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="810.300" stopTime="818.155">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, that's what he was employed for. 
    The employer would have been glad to have him, if he had worked the 40 hours he wanted him to work.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="818.155" stopTime="835.534">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    This is a right that is granted to employees. 
    Employees want to be able to depend upon a certain amount of guaranteed income. 
    I mean, the right to a 40-hour work week is not a benefit for employers, it's a benefit for employees.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="835.534" stopTime="838.819">
    Justice White 
    Yes, but who guaranteed him the right to work 40 hours a week?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="838.819" stopTime="843.171">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    The right is guaranteed by the employer. 
    It was not a guarantee of--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="843.171" stopTime="845.306">
    Justice White 
    Where was that guaranteed him?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="845.306" stopTime="850.210">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --By custom and practice at the refinery. 
    That's a factual finding by both courts below.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="850.210" stopTime="867.236">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, is it a question of a guarantee, counsel? 
    Or is it simply that, were it not for his reservist status, he would work 40 hours a week, and it's because of his reservist status that he's put in what you regard as a position of discrimination.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="867.236" stopTime="883.031">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    He's denied meaningful right to work 40 hours a week because of his reserve status. 
    Now, it's true that they scheduled him, on schedule, for 40 hours, but they scheduled him at times that they knew he could not work. 
    I'm not probably responsive to the questions but that's not a meaningful--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="883.031" stopTime="925.108">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you a question about your distinction of the Hardison case now? 
    Supposing here... and I don't think the record tells us whether this is true or not, but suppose it was here, in order to accommodate his desire to be off on the days where he had reserve obligations, one out of every four weekends, the schedule would require some other employee to work more weekends than he wanted. 
    Now, let's assume it's undesirable to work weekends. 
    Does your position apply even if the rescheduling would impose, may give him a preference at times of desirable work? 
    Or does it only relate to the cases where, given the requirement of meeting his demands, everybody still has the same employment obligation?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="925.108" stopTime="946.171">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Okay, we're not asking for the reservist to be given a preference. 
    It's hard to answer completely in the abstract as to what is reasonable or not. 
    I mean, if the fact that other employees would have to work more weekends, or if it might interfere with some seniority system, there is certainly strong evidence that it's an unreasonable accommodation. 
    Because, I'm just reluctant to admit that there might be some--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="946.171" stopTime="954.527">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, he's getting more than equal treatment, if other employees have to take some undesirable work. 
    That seems to be rather clear in that case. 
    I don't know whether this fellow's in that category or not.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="954.527" stopTime="963.050">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --No, we absolutely concede that he's not entitled to work fewer weekends than the other employees, although it has to be recognized that he is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="963.050" stopTime="972.906">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So your point is that if the company could rearrange the schedules in a way that didn't put any other employee in any worse position than they're in under the normal scheduling, that then he has the right to reschedule?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="972.906" stopTime="976.858">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Yes, that's clear, as far as it goes; I'm not sure.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="976.858" stopTime="1020.986">
    Justice White 
    What if there are two employees; this man goes off to reserve duty and the employer says, fine, I'll reschedule, I'll try to work it out, and he does, and then a man comes to him and says, I understand so and so is getting off for reserve duty and gets rescheduled. 
    Every time he goes to reserve duty I want to go fishing, for the same amount of time and please reschedule me, just the same schedule. 
    And the employer says, you must be out of your mind. 
    You can't; or, I will not do it. 
    Now, you say that the employer certainly could say that in the latter case, but he couldn't say that to the reservist?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1020.986" stopTime="1022.338">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think you've put your finger on it.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1024.188" stopTime="1027.623">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, has Congress made any provision for going fishing?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, he's not being favored, because he doesn't have the right to go fishing either. 
    I mean, this is just a special treatment of this particular category of absences that Congress has mandated.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1037.864" stopTime="1044.001">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, all right, so you do say that it is a special treatment, that the Act does give him special treatment.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1044.001" stopTime="1047.553">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    It requires the employer to treat his absences differently.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Not satisfied by treating his absences like other absences. 
    I still maintain that the bottom line as to what the reservist gets is the same. 
    He works the same number of weekends, the same number of hours.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it fundamentally different from the situation of a man who's gone to Korea or Vietnam or wherever?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No, that's the precise analogy. 
    And this Court has said many times that under the seniority provisions of the reemployment rights statutes the employer is not entitled to treat a veteran's absences the same as he treats absences of--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    There's no argument about that. 
    The only question is whether the Congress intended to give him preference for his being away.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if this statute had been in effect at the time of the Korean War when, let's say, someone like Ted Williams was called back into the service? 
    Do you think after a two-year tour of duty in Korea the veteran could come back and say, I want to be paid for all the time I was away?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1123.767" stopTime="1147.764">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Clearly not. 
    Our contention here is that he has a right to work 40 hours during the week when he's present at work. 
    Now, on these weekends that he misses, he's there at work, during the week, for five days of the week, and we're just asking that he be entitled to work on those five days. 
    Now, if he's gone for two years, he's not at the plant.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, there's no official union presence. 
    I mean, I think union employers are often reluctant to give these benefits, or to give this treatment to reservists unless they're required to do so by the courts, because they're a little concerned that the unions will complain. 
    I mean, I think that perhaps explains why even though it may not have been very difficult for them to accommodate the reservists, they chose not to and chose to litigate it.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I think we can assume that; yes. 
    There is a collective bargaining agreement involved. 
    Now, this case is basically one of statutory construction. 
    Apart from the plain language of the statute that I've already alluded to, there are several principles of statutory construction this Court has established under the veterans provisions, and each of these points towards petitioner's construction of the statute. 
    First, it's always been recognized that the provisions ought to be given liberal construction in favor of the veteran or, as in this case, the reservist. 
    Now, despite this command, the Court of Appeals adopted a very narrow view of the protection here because there was no clear and unambiguous legislative mandate to the contrary. 
    This rejection of what the Court of Appeals recognized to be a plausible interpretation is completely contrary to what this Court has established as the rule for construing the statute. 
    Secondly, this Court has repeatedly recognized the underlying purpose of these provisions, and that is that servicemen not be disadvantaged by serving their country, to the extent possible. 
    In Alabama Power this Court stated this principle thusly: 
    "The provisions evidence Congress's desire to minimize the destruction in individuals' lives resulting from military needs. "

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Horowitz, supposing that this man had a two-week summer duty and when he came back from it he gets paid so much for being in the reserves, he couldn't claim the complete wages that he would have received, but he made a claim against the employer for the difference between what he got paid by the Government for his reserve duty and what he would have made had he stayed at the plant and worked?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1299.061" stopTime="1324.813">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    We said in our brief, there is no basis for such a claim, unless there is some other employment benefit I'm not aware of. 
    But on this benefit we're talking about in this case, the right to a 40-hour work week, he was not denied that right, if he's gone for two weeks. 
    If he's gone for a whole week, there's no way the employer can schedule him for 40 hours of work that week, so he's not entitled to anything. 
    We're not... he's just asking for the right to work, he's not asking to be paid for hours that he does not work.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1324.813" stopTime="1341.507">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And if it's seasonal employment and his reserve duty occurs during the season, he has no claim? 
    A cannery-type thing?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1341.507" stopTime="1459.233">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I'm not sure exactly what situation you're talking about. 
    If there's a way that they can work it out, that he can work the hours, then he has a claim. 
    If there isn't, there isn't. 
    Now, Congress enacted this statute against the background of these principles of construction that I've discussed. 
    They deliberately enacted the statute using broad language. 
    They used the words, 
    "any incident or advantage of employment. " 
    and they used the words, 
    "that the reservist shall not be denied these benefits. " 
    Congress did not intend that the statute be interpreted as narrowly as it has been. 
    Now, I think the waters in this case have been muddied a little bit by the facts, which as I pointed out to Mr. Justice Stevens, are not really at issue in this case. 
    Perhaps I could focus the issue a little better by giving you different examples. 
    Let's suppose the reservist worked at a store where each employee was entitled to two weekends of work in a given month at double pay, and the employer has historically divided the weekends on an alphabetical basis. 
    Those employees in the first half of the alphabet work on the first and third weekends of each month, those in the second half of the alphabet worked on the second and fourth weekends of each month. 
    Now, Mr. Andrews, who works at the store, joins the reserves and now has an obligation to attend reserve duty on the third weekend of those months. 
    Now, our position is that the employer has a duty, since it is no trouble for him at all, to schedule Andrews on the second and the fourth weekend of those months and schedule someone else on the first and the third weekends, even though that violates his long-established rule of how he allocates the weekends. 
    The Court of Appeals position is that the employer is entitled to rely on his rule. 
    The rule is facially neutral, does not discriminate against reservists, and therefore they don't have to do anything for him.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1459.233" stopTime="1495.925">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the rule were that there's a one-month vacation for all employees, and the vacation for A-to-M employees is July and the vacation for N-to-Z employees is August, and some have scheduled, say, refresher teaching courses, some have scheduled vacations with their families, some have scheduled any number of things. 
    Would you say that the reservist has a right to insist that he get the vacation time contrary to policy because of his one-month reserve duty?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1495.925" stopTime="1502.412">

   Argument of Paul S. McAuliffe
speaker="paul_s_mcauliffe" startTime="1657.864" stopTime="1759.063">
    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    During the course of an average year each hourly employee at Sohio's petroleum refinery in Lima, Ohio, will have seven weekends scheduled off from work, during that year. 
    For the other 45 weekends of the calendar year, that employee will be scheduled to work: on 30 of those weekends working both Saturday and Sunday; on the other 15 working one or the other. 
    There is a reason why life appears to be so draconian at the refinery, and that is because, like most petroleum refineries and like many other workplaces in this country, the refinery operates seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
    That means that on every weekend a full operating work force is required to run that refinery. 
    If weekends were staffed on a voluntary basis, in most cases there would be serious practical problems getting a full on a weekend. 
    For that reason Sohio has developed at this refinery, subject to the collective bargaining agreement that exists with the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers, a system of routine rotating scheduling of weekend work on an involuntary basis. 
    Under this system, which is set forth in the record, every employee will have on the average seven weekends off per year, that I have mentioned. 
    In this case we're dealing with one of these employee's who was a member at the time in question of the Ohio National Guard.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1759.062" stopTime="1793.167">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. McAuliffe, could I interrupt with a question, because it affects the argument right here? 
    I didn't know from the record that there were seven weekends off and 45 on, but I'm sure that's correct if you tell us that. 
    Are you also telling us that you could not schedule this man so he'd have 12 weekends off but still work the same number of Saturdays and Sundays? 
    In other words, he'd have to work both days on more weekends, to work the same number of total weekend days? 
    Are you saying you couldn't do that, because of the schedule? 
    There's my question to you.

    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    --If you go through the rotation scheme in there, you will find it works out on the average to seven weekends off per year.

    He can change... I still don't think you've answered my question.

    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    Given the facts we have in this case, that could be done, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    The number of days, if we're talking about, 12 months, 24 days, the total number of weekend days off he would normally have would be 29, so we're talking about a redistribution of his weekend days as well as the days of the other employees. 
    As a practical matter, in most cases, we'll be talking about more than the 24 days, because the reservist will also be gone for two weeks for the summer training camp obligation.

    That would cost premium pay; time and a half. 
    The rearrangement of schedules That the Government is suggesting in this case would require us to take an employee in the same classification as petitioner, require him to work that particular weekend instead, still at his regular pay, no premium pay, because everybody is still just working a 40-hour week under this theory.

    Justice Jr. 
    Well, my question was going to be, haven't we had some of our cases under the veterans return statutes that have interpreted this wording a little more broadly than you submit? 
    You don't think so?
speaker="paul_s_mcauliffe" startTime="2383.846" stopTime="2453.840">
    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    --I don't believe so. 
    The cases under the Veterans Reemployment Act apply to veterans; have said that the seniority that's protected can and should be interpreted when you're talking about seniority to protect the veteran, or in this case the reservist, protect that absence, give them protections that may not exist elsewhere. 
    The difference between our position and the Government's position in this case is that we freely concede that the leave of absence is to be treated better, and, in fact, it is, because of the leave of absence, because of the seniority protection. 
    The Government's argument is that there is an obligation of reasonable accommodation out there that requires even more. 
    What it requires is that the work schedule be changed so that there is no absence at all. 
    What we're talking about is not better treatment, should there be an absence. 
    We freely concede that that is required by this Court's decisions and we have in fact done that in this case; there is no dispute that we have done that.

    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    No, the Court of Appeals, the passage which Mr. Justice Marshall was reciting refers to the version of the statute upon which the Government relies, and the Court of Appeals reads that as requiring neutral treatment.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why did Congress pass the most recent amendment to the Veterans Reemployment Act?
speaker="paul_s_mcauliffe" startTime="2492.299" stopTime="2589.212">
    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    Congress passed this because when they first enacted the reinstatement protection for reservist in 1960 they left a gap in protection, when you compare that to the protection they had already provided for the regular military. 
    The statutes that apply to the regular military create two kinds of statutory protection. 
    The first is a reinstatement right with protection of seniority and status. 
    Congress enacted that for reservists in 24(d) in 1960. 
    There is a second provision of the statute that relates to the regular military that protects them against discharge without cause for a fixed period after their return to work. 
    The reasons for that being to prevent the case where a veteran would be reinstated, given full seniority protection, and then once that had been done, a few weeks down the road that person would be released from employment. 
    In 1960, when Congress specifically extended the statute to the reservists, they provided no comparable protection, and if you look at the legislative history that led to the passage of 21(b)(3), the specific concern of the Department of Labor in proposing the legislation, or the Department of Defense in supporting it, was that there were instances of employees being reinstated after having exercised their reservist rights and then being discharged from employment or denied promotions or suffering other adverse treatment.

    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    That's correct. 
    Absent 21(b)(3), there would be no protection under the statute in that case, and that's the reason Congress enacted it. 
    And that is... it's clear from the legislative history that that was their purpose and this comes clear as well if you look at the interpretations that have been issued under the statute by the Department of Labor from that time to this date, which has specifically described 21(b)(3) as a section designed to protect against discharges, protect against denials of promotion or other discrimination.

    Another way to put the question, I suppose, would you think this case would be different if instead, if the agreement, instead of giving the employees a right to be scheduled for 40 hours, had said they have a right to work 40 hours?

    Mr. Paul S. McAuliffe 
    --That's precisely our argument, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    The principal difference in reading, in our reading of the statute and the reading that the petitioner urges, does come down to the question of whether or not there is a reasonable accommodation requirement that applies. 
    It's our position that there is not, and that, first, if you look at the statute, there's nothing in the language of Section 21(b)(3) which even hints at there being a reasonable accommodation requirement. 
    You also have the fact that in another section of the same statute Congress spoke very specifically to what types of accommodation should be provided when you have a conflict between a reservist schedule and a regular work schedule. 
    I'm referring to Section 24(d). 
    You also have a very clear legislative history of Section 21(b)(3) which shows that its purpose was to protect against discriminatory treatment. 
    We submit that there's no basis in the statute or the legislative history to support the interpretation that the Government has urged upon you in this case. 
    We believe that the reading that we think is the proper reading of 21(b)(3) is the only reading that is consistent with the structure of the statute, with the legislative history, with the administrative guidance that employers have gotten for ten years from the Department of Labor on what their obligations are, as well as the best reading consistent with the use of judicial resources to reconcile claims of what may or may not, within a particular set of facts, be reasonable accommodation. 
    In our view the Congress in 24(d) specifically addressed this question, and gave very detailed, specific, and workable rules for employers to follow. 
    And our contention is that the facts in this case show that Sohio has met all of its obligations with regard to the reserve absence, with regard to the need to provide reinstatement rights, and with regard to 21(b)(3) and its protection against discriminatory treatment. 
    I thank the Court.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Horowitz, the Government's position is that only reasonable efforts to accommodate the needs of a reservist are required under the statute. 
    The statute itself is rather positive, isn't it? 
    2021(b)(3) provides in effect that any person who holds a position described in the statute shall not be denied other incident or advantage. 
    Do you interpret that to require only reasonable effort?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct. 
    The plain language of the statute is that reservists cannot be denied these benefits.
