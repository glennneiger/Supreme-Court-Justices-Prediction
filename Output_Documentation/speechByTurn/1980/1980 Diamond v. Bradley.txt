    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the disposition of two cases to announce in Diamond, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks against Bradley, in an opinion filed with the clerk this morning and the judgment of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is affirmed by an equally divided Court. 
    I took no part in the consideration or the decision of the case.
