    Mr. Chapman, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The Petitioners are here to ask the Court to reverse a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we believe is not only contrary to established principles but creates a very serious practical impediment on the ability of District Courts to coordinate and control multi-party complex litigations. 
    It is our submission that the decision of the Ninth Circuit out back on the normal rule of finality of judgments in the context of multiple-party, multiple action litigation which is exactly the opposite of what should have been done. 
    That is, in these classes of cases there is more rather than less need for adherence to res judicata and the rule of finality. 
    We would like to take a few moments to describe briefly the background of this case and how it comes to this Court. 
    And then to present what we consider the principal reasons why we believe that the Ninth Circuit decision is contrary to established principles of res judicata and out of step with the salutary trends in improving the abilities of the District Court to control and coordinate complex cases. 
    The present case. 
    Your Honor, started the same way as have hundreds of class action cases in the federal court. 
    It's a class action for treble damages and attorneys fees and other relief, following on the heels of a federal government action. 
    In April of 1976, the federal government obtained a misdemeanor indictment against Petitioners under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, charging that the Petitioners had agreed on the prices of women's clothings in their stores in Northern California. 
    Shortly thereafter, a multiplicity of private class actions were filed; there were seven in all, two of those were filed by the same counsel. 
    One of the actions, which was entitled Moitie v. Federated and Saks has been voluntarily dismissed by the Plaintiffs, and that action is not before this Court. 
    The other action is the Brown case, which is the only case that is before the Court this morning. 
    The complaint in the Brown case, as I say, was largely patterned on the government's pleadings. 
    It alleged that the Petitioners had agreed to charge certain prices in their stores on women's clothing and that the Plaintiffs and the class members that were purportedly represented had been injured by being overcharged on those purchases. 
    The one difference was that unlike the government action and the other six class actions, the Brown case alleged that the violations took place in Southern California, rather than in Northern California. 
    Now, the cases proceeded in the District Court before a... they were coordinated before a single judge and in July of 1976, the Petitioners moved to dismiss all seven cases for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). 
    There was extensive briefing on the motion, in fact, the District Court set aside one entire day for oral argument. 
    And in January of 1977, the District Court dismissed all seven cases. 
    There were several issues considered, but the primary ground that was relied upon in the District Court's dismissal was that the Plaintiffs and class members as retail purchasers did not allege an injury to their business or property which would entitle them to treble damage recovery under the Clayton Act, Section 4. 
    The parties in five of the other cases appealed, and we've referred to these for convenience in our brief, as the Weinberg cases. 
    The Weinberg cases all took an appeal from the dismissal of their actions to the Ninth Circuit. 
    However, Brown deliberately chose to break away from the other cases at this point, and did not appeal. 
    When the time for appeal had expired, the Respondent Brown filed a new action in the municipal court in Palo Alto-Mountain View judicial district, which was in all material respects absolutely identical to the prior case. 
    And we've referred to these again, for convenience, the prior dismissed action as Brown I; the second action, which is the action now before this Court as Brown II. 
    As I say, Brown I and Brown II were essentially identical, the same parties were involved, were alleged. 
    There were the same descriptions of trade and commerce, exactly the same offenses charged, the same alleged effects of the offenses were charged, the same time period was covered, the period up to April, 1974. 
    The same geographic area was covered in both complaints. 
    They were the exact verbatim allegations of fraudulent concealment and verbatim the same allegations of the alleged injury. 
    The only difference which we submit, and we believe the... both Courts below perceived as cosmetic differences... was that the word antitrust was not mentioned in the Brown II complaint. 
    Instead, the complaint was framed in terms of four theories under California law: fraud and deceit, unfair business practices, civil conspiracy and restitution. 
    But there has never been any question at any time in this case that the gravamen of the two complaints, Brown I and Brown II, the basic thrust and core of both complaints is absolutely identical. 
    They charge that the Petitioners agreed on their prices of women's clothing prior to April, 1974, in Southern California and that that agreement had the effect of causing the--

 Because they weren't stated when they were first filed in the federal court, is that it?

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    It's the standard principle of res judicata, and I should say, Your Honor, that the... both courts below held... we submit, correctly... that if Brown had been the only case that followed on the government indictment, had it stood below, the standard principles of res judicata would apply. 
    And that can be stated and has been stated in numerous cases in this Court, that a final judgment... it was a final judgment in Brown I... precludes the refiling of the same claim on matters that were raised or could have been raised in the initial case.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    --The federal court had a special interest in connection with Brown II in determining and avoiding circumvention of its initial judgment in Brown I. 
    The federal court had already... there had been active engagement in litigation in the federal court; it had devoted time and attention to these matters. 
    Indeed, as Mr. Justice White pointed out, there were state claims that were before the federal court at the same time that Brown I was dismissed. 
    And it has... consideration of both federal and state claims. 
    Once the federal court enters a judgment, this is really the heart of our case. 
    Mr. Justice White, the rule of res judicata comes into play. 
    There are crucial considerations in terms of avoiding vexatious and multiple litigation, conserving judicial resources and promoting respect for judgment, that come into play when that final judgment is entered... which was entered in Brown I. 
    It is certainly, and we considered it so, and the District Court considered it so, very much in the interest of the District Court to protect its own judgment and to determine the scope of that judgment.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We cite in our reply brief the Fifth Circuit's decision in Woods Petroleum, which was exactly that, where the Fifth Circuit held an injunction by the district court against a state proceeding based on an alleged state theory which was not but could have been alleged as a pendent claim in a prior federal case. 
    And the Fifth Circuit, in Woods, adopted the same rationale that I've just spoken of... that once there's a final judgment in a federal court, the federal court does have the right to protect that judgment.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    No, Your Honor, by no means. 
    I think that the procedural rules that govern the administration and management of cases within the federal courts are determined by federal law, and that the... for example, the 30-day, or whatever period that's established in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure... by statute would cover federal cases... even though on substantive law matters, where a case is in federal court on diversity jurisdiction the federal court would be bound by state law. 
    But certainly not on these procedural matters. 
    They say that there's a... the... the timing and manner in which the supposed state theories were raised in Brown II, are very troublesome. 
    They... all of these theories could have been, and there's no question about it, could have been asserted at the same time that Brown I is filed, and this is another basis thrust of the... this doctrine against splitting a cause of action in res judicata... if you bring a case you should bring forth all your theories at one time. 
    The complaint could have alleged state law theories; in fact, the same counsel had filed a complaint contemporaneously with Brown I, the Moitie case, which did allege state law theories.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    --No, Moitie has been voluntarily dismissed. 
    Let me say, Your Honor, that when the Defendants argued for... on the motion to dismiss before the district court, and I am again talking about the first cases, Brown I, Moitie I, the Weinberg seven cases... we were faced with some complaints that alleged Sherman Act violations, other complaints that alleged Cartwright Act, California law violations. 
    And we argued that the determining rule, that is, the standard for determining business or property, was the same under federal law as under California law. 
    So those issues were presented to the district court at the time that the district court dismissed Brown I and dismissed Moitie I. 
    And it disposed of all seven cases including the case before this Court, in its entirety. 
    The crucial difference was that in Brown, which is the only case before this Court, no appeal was taken; instead, an attempt was made to refile, with different theories, all of which could have been brought before the district court, they could have been in the original complaint but they were not. 
    There could have been an argument presented to the district court in the context I've just mentioned that even if you hold that under federal law retail purchasers cannot, do not meet the business or property standard... that these Plaintiffs could go forward under state law, that could have been done. 
    There could have been a motion to amend the complaint; the federal rules are very liberal.

    --If I may address specifically what the Ninth Circuit did? 
    The Ninth Circuit stated that if there had only been the Brown case, that the normal standards of res judicata... and it didn't purport to distinguish between federal or state law would apply and that the failure to appeal from the dismissal of Brown I would bar the refiling of Brown II.

    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    Precisely. 
    And the important element here is that this was a federal judgment and the scope of the federal judgment is a matter of federal law. 
    This Court had held that in Stoll v. Gottlieb and other cases. 
    But the crucial distinction as to what the Court of Appeals did was as follows: the Court of Appeals said again, if this was only one case, we would have no trouble applying res judicata. 
    But it noted that the Weinberg cases, the other five federal cases which were dismissed at the same time as Brown I, did appeal. 
    They followed the orderly course and took their case up to the Ninth Circuit. 
    Subsequently, this Court, in Reiter v. Sonotone, held that under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, retail purchasers do state a claim of injury to their business or property and so on the basis of that, the Weinberg cases were reversed by the Ninth Circuit and sent back to the district court. 
    A few months later, Brown II was argued in the Court of Appeals. 
    And the Court of Appeals decided this case on one ground and one ground only, and that is that because the other plaintiffs in other separately filed independent actions, the Weinberg cases, did appeal and did obtain a reversal in their case that even though Plaintiff Brown had suffered a final judgment, and not attempted to appeal his case, but in fact attempted to refile in another litigation, that Brown is entitled to have his action reinstated because of the benefit of the appeal by the other parties. 
    And that was the issue and the only issue raised in the petition for certiorari--

 Mr. Chapman, are you saying that... I guess you are, that if you file a federal cause of action in federal court, a federal question case, if out of those facts you have a pendent state claim you must file it. 
 Not only does the federal court have jurisdiction over these pendent claims, but it has... would have absolutely no discretion to refuse to decide the pendent claims.

    --solely that the only reason why res judicata should be relieved in this case was that the other cases were reversed on appeal. 
    And we submit that that creates a premium for overriding the finality of judgment in just the worst kind of cases where you have a piling-on of multiple actions in the wake of a government antitrust case, which is very typical. 
    The only reason that this case is here is because other parties in other cases did appeal and did obtain a reversal. 
    And we believe that to allow relief from the finality of judgments because of actions taken by other parties would only impair the ability of the district courts to coordinate and control complex multi-party class actions.

    May I say, there's no question but that California law and federal law are absolutely identical on what is meant by res judicata. 
    The problem in this case is that the Ninth Circuit refused to follow any of the standards of res judicata by virtue of one fact and one fact alone, namely that the other cases, the Weinberg cases, were reversed on appeal.

    --The question is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the dismissal for res judicata. 
    The grounds, which were stated by the Court of Appeals, was that res judicata would apply but for the action in the other multiple cases. 
    And we say, Your Honor, that there is absolutely no basis, indeed, Respondent presents no basis for the novel ruling of the Court of Appeals in this case.

   Argument of Jerrold N. Offstein
speaker="jerrold_n_offstein" startTime="1831.827" stopTime="1936.300">
    Mr. Jerrold N. Offstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The facts have been developed. 
    Seeing the noon hour approaching, I'm going to try to concentrate on points that we concentrated on. 
    I believe the Court of Appeals sought and... in my view, the Court of Appeals tried to do, was have the baby. 
    It did not want litigation about the same complaints, if you will, and... the same cognizable claim or not... before both the federal and the state court. 
    And in so doing ignored its own ruling, in Hodge v. Mountain States Telephone Company. 
    Now Hodge, is very interesting, because it causes me to disagree with a great deal of the authority cited by my opposition. 
    Hodge is a case wherein summary judgment was had over both state and pendent claims, in the district court, the Ninth Circuit in 1977, reversed that saying, according to Mine Workers v. Gibbs if there is no substantial federal question, state claim as a matter of comity belong in the state courts. 
    That California law follows that is cited... is stated very clearly in the case we cite as Merry v. Coast Community College, where the... and I'm quoting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consistently held that where a federal claim dismissed on a motion for summary judgment before there has been a substantial expenditure of the Court's time or energy on the case, proper exercise of discretion requires dismissal of the state claims without prejudice to plaintiff's right to litigate them in a proper state forum.

    Principally what was disposed of in Brown I? 
    It was the question of whether or not the plaintiff could maintain a cognizable claim under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
    I was in a court of limited jurisdiction, they told me go away, in its entirety. 
    I went to the Court of general jurisdiction with my claims.

    Mr. Jerrold N. Offstein 
    In a blur. 
    There were two issues that I believe defeat the diversity jurisdiction in the case at bar, to-wit, Brown II. 
    Point Number One: at the time we filed the action in municipal court, in California, the jurisdictional amount was $5,000 and that's what we pleaded per claimant. 
    Not $10,000. 
    Under Younger, Harris that cannot be aggregated. 
    Moreover, no injunction was sought, so the jurisdictional amount, it seems to me cannot be generated that way. 
    Accordingly, in my mind, and I've never seen it actually adjudicated, there was never diversity jurisdiction in this case.

    --But once there's no federal nexus and once we haven't gone into... Mine Worker v. Gibbs it seems to me there was a discussion in the beginning of the opinion where it said even if you were to get into the trial on the merits of the cause, and the only merits we've had heard are whether or not we had standing to maintain a cognizable claim under Section 4 in a court of limited jurisdiction.

    But in Angel v. Bullington, the Court says the "merits" of a claim are disposed of when it is refused enforcement.

    Mr. Jerrold N. Offstein 
    I believe, Your Honor, as I understand the premises, the increments that add up to whether or not one is entitled to res judicata in effect, against an opponent, is whether or not some threshold bar has prevented an actual dispute or a resolution of the substance of the dispute in the case at bar, whether or not certain activity took place on the part of the department stores which caused injury, proximately caused injury to these people, these claimants in the class... putative class.

    Did you make any motion to remand the case?
speaker="jerrold_n_offstein" startTime="2217.268" stopTime="2252.396">
    Mr. Jerrold N. Offstein 
    I did, Your Honor, in Brown II. 
    In Brown I there was nothing to remand. 
    The Court sua sponte invited the motion from the defense to dismiss for want of standing under the Clayton Act. 
    That motion was briefed, held under submission for a long time. 
    It was granted, the actions were dismissed in their entirety. 
    I read Mine Worker v. Gibbs, it said when there is nothing to append a state claim to, you don't belong in federal court. 
    So we went to the only other available forum, the court of general jurisdiction, the state courts, whose rules of res judicata... the facts at bar in this Merry v. Coast Community College case, say we did the right thing.

    Because it was my reading of the rules,... hopefully an accurate one, that once the case was brought up, irrespective of the narrow point, once the entire file would be brought forward the ultimate reasoning of the Court and the increments of its reasoning, I've been led to believe that this Court in particular deals with substance, not form.

   Rebuttal of Jerome I. Chapman
speaker="jerome_i_chapman" startTime="2611.364" stopTime="2677.696">
    Mr. Jerome I. Chapman 
    I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to make two brief points. 
    First, the issue that is presented in this petition is the Ninth Circuit's ruling that in multiple-party actions, the appeal by certain parties relieves the party who didn't appeal from the normal application of res judicata. 
    It's our submission, for the reasons in our briefs, that this would create a tremendous hardship and burden in the administration of complex, multiple-party class actions. 
    The Respondent's submission, Your Honor, would, if accepted, create a burden in all cases, because he is arguing in favor of piecemeal litigation, that you don't have to bring forward once you come into a federal court, or whatever court with your first complaint, you don't have to bring forward all your theories, you don't have to bring forward all of your rights for recovery, you don't have to give the district court discretion to choose whether or not to handle all the cases at one time. 
    So we believe that the issue presented by Respondents is not properly here, and we urge reversal of the Ninth Circuit and reinstatement of the district court's decision.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2677.696" stopTime="2679.602">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
