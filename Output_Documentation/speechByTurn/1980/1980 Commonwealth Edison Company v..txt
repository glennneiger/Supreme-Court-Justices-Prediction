    We'll hear arguments next in Commonwealth Edison et al. v. Montana. 
    Mr. Rogers, I think you may now proceed whenever you wish.
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="86.512" stopTime="243.042">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a challenge to a Montana tax based on the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause. 
    The tax was enacted in 1975. 
    Prior to 1975 there was an array of taxes in Montana, including a net proceeds tax, a property tax, license tax, and a severance tax. 
    In addition, the state received royalties from the Federal Government to cover the impact of mining coal in Montana. 
    And the coal companies... mindful of the problems they had with Anaconda Copper and earlier, provided that the coal companies had to reclaim the land as they mined and they had to post substantial bonds to guarantee that the land would be properly reclaimed. 
    So presumably, the taxes on the books at that time were sufficient to meet the cost of the services provided by Montana. 
    In fact... and I point out that this tax was a 1975 tax... in 1973 the severance tax had been increased from 10 cents a ton, based on BTU, to approximately 34 cents a ton. 
    Shortly thereafter, the Arab oil embargo occurred and it became clear that the nation was facing a very serious energy crisis. 
    So Montana saw an opportunity. 
    Montana has more than 25 percent of the coal reserves in the United States and it started to plan how it could maximize its taxes. 
    The spirit in which it was done was exemplified by one of its sponsors in the House of Representatives when he said, the Arabs have the oil but we have the coal. 
    Most of this coal is shipped out of the state; 90 percent of it, in fact. 
    And the coal is leased under long-term contracts, so the discussion in the Legislature for the most part involved the question, how much would the market xx? 
    The Legislature was advised that the amount of the tax would not be subject to any judicial review.

    No, we're not. 
    We're claiming that, actually, Montana in this cases did not meet the tests of Complete Auto and Washington Stevedoring. 
    We don't claim that they're not entitled to tax. 
    We think that the tax because it was specifically tailored to fall on customers outside the state has to be fairly related to the services provided by Montana.

    --No, we have not, Your Honor. 
    That is a misstatement. 
    We said that we could not imagine that a tax, that a severance tax of 12-1/2 percent would ever be more than enough. 
    We think that probably in this case a tax... well, my studies show that no matter how they figured the cost of the services that might be necessary to provide for additional mining of coal, that it could never amount to more than 10 cents a ton additional.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    No, I would not think so, Your Honor. 
    We think that in a case like this... and I'll come to this in just a moment... that it was deliberately tailored to fall on people outside the state and it's under long-term contracts... the coal companies couldn't get out of those contracts... plus the fact that Montana has 25 percent of all the nation's coal resources and it has over 50 percent of the low sulfur coal in the United States. 
    Now, we say, under these circumstances, because it's a tailored tax and because it falls to a large extent... 90 percent of the tax is paid for by people in other states... that we are entitled to a trial to show that by no stretch of the imagination can Montana show that they need this money for the services that are provided by Montana.

    That is all. 
    Now, it's interesting, too, that the... let me say before I get to that, so far this tax has amounted... this tax; not the other taxes; this tax... has amounted to about $200 million. 
    They expect the tax will amount to over a billion dollars in the next ten years and several billions of dollars in the next 20 years. 
    And we're prepared to prove these things. 
    We have had a comprehensive study made which showed to our satisfaction that there's no justification for this tax.

    Well, as we read Complete Auto, and Washington Stevedoring, the Court has held that there are four prongs to the test: one, the nexus test; one, the apportionment test, neither of which come into play here; third, the discrimination test, and this case clearly shows the discrimination here. 
    Let me just read what the Senator said who proposed the tax, if I can find it. 
    But anyway, he pointed out that... and this is in the legislative history, that this tax was going to be paid for initially by the coal companies but because of the contracts it would be immediately paid for by the utilities, who in turn under the law passed that on to the customers. 
    So, the tax is being paid for by the customers in Chicago, in Detroit, Minneapolis, and other cities and towns.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Oh, I think, Your Honor, that you have established a standard, a fairly related standard. 
    You say in Complete Auto that if a state... first, you say clearly that the state has the right to tax interstate commerce, and in Complete Auto you wipe away the distinctions about labels. 
    And you said, let's consider the practical effect of a tax, which seems to most lawyers, it's a very sensible position. 
    Now, the practical effects of this tax... and you don't have to take my word for it, you can look at the legislative history... is, in the first instance, to transfer the tax from people in Montana to out-of-state taxpayers who obviously were not part of the political process.

    In this case there was no legislative history, no attempt by the Legislature, really, to justify the amount of the tax. 
    Secondly, they really tailored it, as I've said, to fall on people outside the state. 
    Third, they realized there was a national emergency and they could take advantage of the crisis. 
    Now, we would expect that if we tried the case we can show these things.

    In other words, the fact is, Justice Rehnquist, there is no justification for this tax.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Maybe I should amend that to say that there was no justification made for it in the Legislature. 
    Maybe they can justify it at a trial, and we have no objection to that. 
    We intended to get discovery in this case and we were enjoined from any discovery. 
    So, if Montana has a justification, and I'm certainly prepared to accept that there is a possibility of it, they certainly didn't make it in the legislative history.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    That's right. 
    So, there are only 1,500 people involved in this mining. 
    It's a very low labor intensive operation, so they have very few people connected with mining. 
    Now, certainly they should pay their share and even more than their share. 
    We'd be willing to concede ten times their share of libraries and hospitals and all the other indirect costs you can think of. 
    The difficulty Montana has with the case is they can't think of any reasons. 
    Now, we'd like to try it. 
    We don't want to try it here. 
    We'd like to have a trial and I can assure the Court, if the Court says, in effect that a state under these circumstances can tax without limit, then it's just a matter of time before the other states that have minerals would be right in line. 
    So we believe that there should be some standard, even if it's a rough equivalence, that a state has to use in passing statutes designed to tax people outside of the state. 
    As to the Supremacy Clause, we have made, I think, a substantial argument in the brief. 
    I don't have anything to add to that at the moment.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Oh, yes: surely, surely. 
    But what I'm saying is, it would be very difficult to eliminate the constitutional issues in advance, Justice White, and we don't think that's the way to do it. 
    As I say, one of the problems here was that the Legislature in Montana was advised that they would have no legal problems, that the courts would not challenge this tax, and if... I am satisfied that if the Legislature had been advised that this tax was going to be subject to judicial scrutiny, that we wouldn't be here today because the tax would have been much less. 
    When Montana imposed this tax was four times as large as any severance tax in the nation. 
    So this is an excessive, exorbitant tax, and we would like to have a trial to prove it. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Michael T. Greely
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1292.779" stopTime="1392.850">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to focus the Court's attention today on the actual allegations that the appellants declared in their complaint because there have been a lot of facts bandied about both in the briefs and suggested today by counsel for the appellants as to what the allegations were and what kind of facts the appellants could prove if they'd gone to trial. 
    First of all, I think it's important to note that basically under the Commerce Clause the appellants have alleged that the mined coal in Montana is destined for outside the state, that the coal is taxed at 20 to 30 percent of the value. 
    Actually the effective rate of the tax is 22 percent, since the production costs, the taxes on production costs are backed out before the severance tax applies. 
    And thirdly, they've alleged that the revenues that are anticipated by Montana in the fiscal years '78 and '79 are $34 and $40 million respectively for all coal, not just the coal that they're mining, but for all coal that will be mined in Montana in those years. 
    And then they say, therefore, that our tax is not fairly related to the services and protections provided by the State of Montana, but in their briefs and today in oral argument we hear that Montana's legitimate needs have already been met, and we hear that the local impact costs from appellants' activities only amount to two cents a ton whereas our tax amounts to $2 or more a ton. 
    And we also hear that the tax bears no relationship to the legitimate needs of the people of the State of Montana.

    Essentially, what the district court held, as I would... under Montana law, would be that under the allegations in the complaint no facts that the plaintiffs could have proved would have given them a right for a trial under the Commerce Clause claims.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1436.127" stopTime="1470.301">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Mr. Attorney General, let me put a hypothetical question to you. 
    Suppose the Legislature passed an act declared on its face to be a substitute, in terms of revenue, for all other taxes levied in the state... state income taxes, state real estate taxes, sales taxes, so that the locals would pay no taxes at all, and all of it would, all the cost of government would be put on one category of taxpayers. 
    Do you think the courts could inquire into that?
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1470.301" stopTime="1499.711">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Are you talking about a state tax as a substitute for all other state taxes? 
    I think there's broad discretion in the Legislature as to how to raise money. 
    I think the constitutional challenge to that type of a tax would be the same that we have on other areas, whether there is a due process question or whether there was a Commerce Clause, possibly a Commerce Clause question. 
    I think the fact that the Legislature decides to have one tax is not by itself significant.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1499.711" stopTime="1504.224">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But one tax on just one category of taxpayers. 
    That's the thrust of--
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1504.224" stopTime="1517.000">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Well, assuming there was no other discriminations or anything else, I think that that would be something that could feasibly, if that was the decision of the legislature, could feasibly be upheld. 
    It depends upon what the constitutional challenge was.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1517.000" stopTime="1530.043">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    --Well, the courts can inquire into it. 
    Could there be some judicial inquiry into whether this was a discriminatory tax aimed at one category of people?
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1530.043" stopTime="1546.503">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Oh, I suppose that that's possible, certainly. 
    I guess it depends on what the basis for the challenge would be. 
    Certainly if it was suggested that the distinction, the taxpayer distinction, the class distinctions were not proper, it might be an equal protection question or something which the courts could certainly take a look at.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1546.503" stopTime="1578.913">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, it would be not an abnormal process for legislators of a state, particularly, to say, let's put as much as the traffic will bear on the outsiders and relieve the local citizens of our state. 
    And my hypothetical is an extreme one but they are relieved of all taxes because of the windfall they would get out of taxing one particular industry or one particular category of taxpayers.
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1578.913" stopTime="1599.998">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Well, that's true. 
    And certainly if that was done on just on one industry there may be a question. 
    But if you're suggesting that this tax is such a tax, the severance tax in Montana applies equally to any coal that's mined in Montana whether it's to be consumed in Montana or without of Montana, there's no Commerce Clause discrimination question about the severance tax on our coal since it applies equally.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1599.998" stopTime="1610.322">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    In other words, in that respect it's different from the case that was argued previously, where there's a difference in the tax on the material taken out of the state?
speaker="michael_t_greely" startTime="1610.322" stopTime="1621.022">
    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Yes, absolutely. 
    That sounds... if that's the factual situation in that case, there could be a commerce clause discrimination problem which I don't believe is present here in this case.

    Well, we're citing Heisler for the proposition that essentially that a severance tax which is a local activity is not a burden on interstate commerce. 
    Obviously, at that time there was a per se rule that has possibly been somewhat eroded to date, but the basic holding there was that mining because of the nature of the activity was not a burden on interstate commerce.

    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Well, I think if you apply the facts of our case to Complete Auto, that we meet the tests of Complete Auto, in fact, the appellants have conceded that; for the fact that they say that we do meet that test, and that our rate, if we had a rate, a lower rate, that there wouldn't be a problem whatsoever. 
    The only thing that distinguishes this from Complete Auto is that it has a much higher rate. 
    And then in addition to that they say, okay, the fair relation test. 
    Well, I guess the question we're saying is that I'm not absolutely certain what the fair relation test means but I know what it doesn't mean and I know it doesn't mean what the plaintiffs say it does. 
    And that is that under a fairly related test under Complete Auto that the courts will somehow adjudicate the rate of our tax and put a dollar-to-dollar figure. 
    In other words, the courts are supposed to add up our trained work force, the number of roads we have in the state, especially those that may be applying to the appellants at the mine sites; that we figure out how much fire protection, we figure out what the social consequences will be. 
    It seems to me that this is a mammoth judicial undertaking and all the cases essentially say, this is a legislative prerogative, this is a political question.

    I think the Magnano case that had to do with oleomargarine and the Pittsburgh parking case, I think that there are cases in which taxes are used to discourage activities.

    And the courts, to my knowledge, have never done that because to tax is an assessment of benefits, and there's no cases that I'm aware of that say that you have to have a quid pro quo tax... that the amount of the activities of the plaintiffs in the State of Montana and their mining activities, whatever damage they're doing. 
    And the problem we have, of course, with even going to trial on that is that the damages that they are doing and could be done could be things that we couldn't make a factual determination on: the esthetic value, what's going to happen to the wildlife, what's going to happen 30 years from now, at what point in time do we start adding up all these things? 
    Do we wait for a few years and see what happens or do we do it now? 
    And what we're saying is, is that the Commerce Clause does not require any such quid pro quo tax, that a tax is an assessment of benefits; that if a corporation doesn't have school children, it doesn't mean that they don't have to pay school bonds.

    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    --Yes, in answer to your question, I think that even though we can't say maybe exactly what it means, I don't think that it would be a meaningless test. 
    For instance, the Court could have intended by that that the states must impose, if they impose taxes they must allow the taxpayers to avail themselves of the services, and the appellants in this case haven't alleged that they don't... that they're not capable of benefiting from the services that Montana provides. 
    Perhaps the Court meant that the tax must somehow be related to the activities of the taxpayer in the state. 
    And I think clearly that's the case when you attach the tax to the percentage of the value of the mined coal. 
    Now, I suppose... another thing, they suggested that all the states could meet this test, and I suggest to this Court that that's probably true, because I think most of the state taxes, certainly those that are a severance tax, would meet this kind of a fairly related test and that unless the Court were to find, for instance, that Montana taxed the net federal income of the coal companies as opposed to anything that relates to coal, maybe that wouldn't be related to what the activities were. 
    But getting back to our main point, the fact is that the fairly related test does not require a balancing of benefits and burdens of providing certain services for the taxpayers other than the ones that they would generally be entitled to by living in the State of Montana.

    Clearly, that is one of the factors that was considered. 
    It's also to raise general revenue for the State of Montana. 
    Their concern about the impacts... we're still concerned about the impacts of strip mining in the State of Montana, but that's not the only purpose of the tax.

    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    Possibly. 
    Possibly, that you're going to ask one group of taxpayers to shoulder the burden of taxes throughout the state. 
    However, it's not necessarily... in the Carmichael case, for instance, the corporations who happened to have full employment were, in essence were paying a tax that they didn't need to benefit from, because they kept their employees on the job. 
    But some of the other corporations who had to pay less of the tax because they had some of their people were unemployed, so then they did it on the basis of how many workers you had in your plant, actually ended up benefiting because they paid less tax but their unemployed people got more benefits. 
    I think the key thing here is that this tax is not benefits-burdens or a tit-for-tat quid-pro-quo tax. 
    The fairly related test doesn't require this. 
    A tax is a general assessment, it's for the common good government. 
    I think if this Court were to look into rates of taxes under the Commerce Clause, that you would be going against the fundamental proposition as I understand the taxing laws and the ability of the state to tax, and that is that they raise taxes for the common good, and that the courts don't normally go into an inquiry as to what the Legislature based its decision on.

    Mr. Michael T. Greely 
    There is a... we have what we call the Coal Board, which is a Board appointed by the Governor, and they have authority to distribute a certain amount of money, and applications are made from the local governments in the area where the strip mining takes place, and those applications for grant monies are determined by the Board and money would be given to those localities for various things such as schools, fire and police protection, education, or whatever. 
    But there is no direct grant. 
    There is a percentage of the fund that's set aside for local impacts, and that percentage is 8.75 percent.

   Rebuttal of William P. Rogers
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="2379.526" stopTime="2643.445">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Well, I'll just take a minute. 
    I think that this discussion has focused on the issue, and that is whether the Complete Auto test and the Washington Stevedoring test have any meaning. 
    It's our position that they do have meaning, and that the Court intended that they have meaning. 
    This, it seems to us, is a classic case because we've been denied a trial and the position of Montana and the Solicitor General both is that there is no limit to the tax that Montana may impose. 
    As the Attorney General said today, that they may impose, that they would be entitled constitutionally to impose a tax of 1,000 percent, and in the Montana court it was argued that the tax would be without limit. 
    So, this is a situation where 75 percent of this coal is owned by the Federal Government. 
    Montana could not impose a tax on that coal without running into the Supremacy Clause, so it has taxed 30 percent allegedly on the severance of the coal. 
    And I think it's admitted by... as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, by the Solicitor General, that Heisler does not apply here. 
    The Supreme court of Montana rested its case on Heisler. 
    So, we believe that we are entitled to a trial. 
    I think the questions that the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens asked were most appropriate because the fact is that because the tax revenues are so great as a result of this tax, that other taxes are being reduced, and as the taxes continue to grow and as this trust fund continues to grow, it already has $200 million, so the interest on... I don't mean the trust fund has; I mean the tax is $200 million, so the trust fund is getting up, $100 million, as as time goes on it will be in the billions, and Montana won't need any other taxes. 
    This tax already is amounting to almost, it's approaching 20 percent of the total tax revenues of the state, so it's only a matter of time that there will be no necessity for taxes in Montana. 
    And under these circumstances, if Complete Auto means anything... and we think it does... in Washington Stevedoring case the Court pointed out that there was no trial, that the appellants had not made their claim of not-fairly-related. 
    So we think the Complete Auto test requires a trial, and in this case, when it was so clearly tailored to fall on taxpayers outside the state, we believe that we are entitled to a trial. 
    If the Court should decide in favor of Montana, that we are not entitled to a trial, that means that under these circumstances in the future any state could tax without limit, and I think the without-limit concept would have the effect of balkanizing this nation. 
    There are mineral resources and there are timber resources and all kinds of resources, and if each state may tax without limit, disregarding the needs of the nation and that the only remedy will be to go to Congress each time and ask for Congress to preempt the tax, it will be very difficult. 
    We don't think that this Court would want to create that type of result. 
    We believe that after a trial that Montana will realize that this tax is excessive. 
    Already the people in Montana... I notice some Senators are saying the tax is excessive, and I think once this Court lays down some general guidelines for the states, that the state legislatures will tend to comply with those guidelines. 
    We do not suggest that the courts, any courts, set the tax. 
    We say the tax should be set by the state legislatures, but they should be fairly related to the services and protection provided to the taxpayer by the state. 
    Thank you very much.

    Mr. Rogers, may I ask you a question before you conclude? 
    You haven't had a chance to introduce evidence but are there public records that would show which states have the minerals that are essential to the operation of our country? 
    For example, how many states have uranium?

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Well, I don't know the answer specifically to uranium but the answer to your question is, yes, there are records. 
    For example, Montana and Wyoming together have 40 percent of the coal reserves of the total country.

    The basic purpose of the Commerce Clause is to permit a free market for goods in commerce so that no state may impose an undue burden on that commerce, and that the Federal Government should guard against states imposing undue burdens on that commerce. 
    And we believe that in this case that's exactly what Montana has done.
