    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court in this matter this morning is whether a defendant in a federal antitrust action may seek contributions, and the threshold question we submit to the Court is whether the remedy sought here is one that is necessary to achieve the congressional intent of the antitrust laws? 
    Will it further the congressional goals to grant contributions? 
    In order to address the question, we would briefly like to just review the very brief facts of this case. 
    We are dealing here with a situation in which a plaintiff has filed a treble damage action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, alleging a pricefixing conspiracy. 
    The plaintiff has sued Texas Industries. 
    Identified as alleged coconspirators with Texas Industries were the three respondents. 
    The plaintiff did not sue the three respondents, he selected Texas Industries as the target and Texas Industries in turn filed a third party demand seeking contribution. 
    Now, although, in order for liability to exist to the plaintiff here, there must have been some participation by one or more of these respondents along with Texas Industries, the plaintiff can do what he has done here. 
    He can select and he can elect, as he has done, to sue a single tortfeasor. 
    Under the existing case law all coconspirators are joint tortfeasors and have been so for many, many years. 
    Each, as a joint tortfeasor, is liable for the whole of the damages that the plaintiff can prove. 
    And in addition, even if the plaintiff here had elected to sue all four and had obtained a judgment against all four, he could then elect to levy his judgment on any one of the four and collect from that one. 
    In the absence of contribution, TXI, Texas Industries, cannot force any of these respondents to share the common burden, and had the plaintiff sued all four and obtained a judgment and decided to levy on one, that one in the absence of contribution could not force the other judgment debtors to pay any share of their judgment.

 Mr. Slater, one of the amicus briefs makes the point that I found quite an intriguing point, that while you present this case as whether there is or is not a right, or should be or should not be, and you say there should be, and is... a right of contribution in antitrust suits among joint tortfeasors, the point made by the amicus brief is that this question can arise in a variety of ways and maybe there's no single correct answer in every context. 
 Now, you've already given us a context that this case does not involve. 
 This person did not sue four people, this plaintiff. 
 He sued only one. 
 And in this case you claim contribution from the unsued coconspirators. 
 You have just given us an example of sued coconspirators against whom judgments are made, and talking about the execution of those judgments. 
 Then, there's a lot of talk in these amicus briefs about carving and contribution as against settling, codefendants and so on, which also are not involved in this case, and to which the answer might be different. 
 Do you think it's a single question, or do you think that it's many questions, and that the answer may be different according to the question in each separate context?

 This person did not sue four people, this plaintiff. 
 He sued only one. 
 And in this case you claim contribution from the unsued coconspirators. 
 You have just given us an example of sued coconspirators against whom judgments are made, and talking about the execution of those judgments. 
 Then, there's a lot of talk in these amicus briefs about carving and contribution as against settling, codefendants and so on, which also are not involved in this case, and to which the answer might be different. 
 Do you think it's a single question, or do you think that it's many questions, and that the answer may be different according to the question in each separate context?

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I view contribution as a remedy that will further the goals sought by the antitrust laws and I think it is a remedy that should be recognized as such, and that even though it might arise in a variety of contexts, such as a settlement, for example, that can be handled.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    We don't have a settlement here. 
    Yes, sir, that's correct. 
    But our position, I think, we've said in the brief, even though we are not involved in a settlement situation, that we would never suggest that a settling defendant should be brought back into the case.

    Some of the questions that have been raised are whether, for example, if a pro rata approach was taken to contributions, such as was done in the Professional Beauty Supply case, it may well be that the way to handle settlements is to count the number of conspirators, and if a plaintiff settles with one of the ten, let's say, then his claim is reduced by ten percent. 
    That's a simple--

    No, sir. 
    What I would suggest in that case would be that, and as Justice Stewart points out, we're getting into some areas where there are a lot of answers and a lot of questions; but the pro rata approach, as taken by the Court would be... in our situation, for example, had the plaintiff settled with three of the four, then his claim would have been reduced by 75 percent. 
    Now, before he settled with the three of those four, he would give some serious thought, if he knew that, and assuming he knew the law. 
    Then, before he would settle for $1,000, he would think very hard, because he would be giving up a substantial part of his claim. 
    On the other hand, be would know what he was giving up. 
    If it turned out that there were more coconspirators than four, then the amount he's given up would simply be--

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    No, you don't, but you should have some idea in most of these cases of generally what damages are going in. 
    And certainly sometimes they'll claim that there's been an overcharge in a pricefixing case of $10 a yard, when in fact it's gone up $2. 
    But the parties who were actually involved in that sort of thing should have some idea as to what the evidence will show, and be able to handle what they feel are the damages. 
    If Your Honors please, the ultimate effect of a no contribution rule is that the conspirators whose joint illegal activities create the liability may escape that liability and go scot free at the whim of a plaintiff. 
    That really is the end line of a rule against contribution.

    And it's a question of what is fair and that's... the evolution of this doctrine of permitting contribution has evolved along that line.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    That's correct, under 10(b)(5). 
    But you're correct that there is, in the statute, there are some references to contribution. 
    If Your Honors please, in order to determine whether contribution is a remedy which will achieve congressional intent, we think it's appropriate in the first place to actually first analyze the statutes, take a look at Section 1 of the Sherman and at Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
    And an analysis of these statutes clearly showed that they are penal, they are punitive statutes, that they're designed to provide both civil and criminal punishment for violators of the antitrust laws. 
    Section 1 of the Sherman Act establishes a violation, it defines illegal activities, and it provides that every contract combination of conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade is illegal, and that every person, who engages in those illegal activities is guilty. 
    And it then provides for criminal penalties. 
    Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that any person who is injured in his business or his property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may recover treble damages. 
    Now, when these statutes are read together, it becomes pretty clear that what constitutes the violations of the antitrust laws and the penalties therefore, and that there are really established two groups, those that can recover treble damages and those that are liable for those damages.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1020.143" stopTime="1037.386">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But then to pursue that in pari delicto concept, the statute treats them all in equal fault as with a felony murder case, for example, does.
speaker="benjamin_r_slater_jr" startTime="1037.386" stopTime="1038.089">
    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Yes, sir, it does.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1038.089" stopTime="1049.975">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    So should any court undertake to make some different evaluations, saying one of them is more or less at fault than the other?
speaker="benjamin_r_slater_jr" startTime="1049.975" stopTime="1114.607">
    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Well, that is one of the possible ways of apportioning the liability among joint tortfeasors. 
    Now, certainly that has been done in some areas where contribution is permitted. 
    You have a comparative fault concept, or a relative culpability concept, which I think is what Your Honor is referring to, where you in effect say, one is more guilty... put it that way... than the others. 
    The difficulties with that approach is that at the present time all cotortfeasors are equally liable and if you approach it on the basis of an apportionment of fault, then you will be calling on the courts at that point to in effect referee degrees of fault as among wrongdoers and you are calling on each of the tortfeasors to attempt to show that he is not quite as wrong as the other fellow.

    That's true, and it's also true that there are some jurisdictions in which they actually apportion fault, based on whether you felt there's really a comparative fault in order to achieve contributions.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    And we're not suggesting that you in effect bring in a defendant and say, defendant, you're in the case, as you do in admiralty, you're in here for all purposes. 
    What we're saying is that under Rule 14 you can third-party your cotortfeasors and bring them in and say, you are liable to me, and I am liable... if I am liable to the plaintiff. 
    In order to achieve what we perceive to be this congressional intent as expressed in the statutes themselves, we believe that it is essential that contribution be permitted among joint tortfeasors. 
    Without contribution there is no mechanism whatever by which the liability of all civil violators can be assured, where the plaintiff can elect to sue one or more coconspirators or levy against one or more coconspirator judgment debtors. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, the courts have recognized that one of the major goals, or one of the major purposes of the federal antitrust laws was to penalize wrongdoers, to deprive violators of the antitrust laws of the fruits of their illegal acts. 
    And this Court, in the Brunswick case in 1977, stated that treble damages play an important role in penalizing wrongdoers. 
    In the Pfizer case, in 1978--

    Well, Louisiana has a statute, for example. 
    There are many states that have statutes, but with respect to the Chief Justice's question, we believe that when the congressional goals of the antitrust laws are clear, that every person in a joint action who violates the antitrust laws shall be liable; that this Court has the power and the authority to fashion a remedy, if that's what Your Honor wishes to call it, to accomplish that objective. 
    And certainly there are a number of cases that have emanated from the Court where the Court has recognized that the antitrust laws are not comprehensive in nature. 
    The National Society of Professional Engineers is a recent case that we have cited in the brief. 
    Now, in Pfizer v. Government of India... it was a 1978 case... this Court recognized the right of a foreign plaintiff to sue for treble damages on the theory that to deprive the plaintiff of the right to sue would permit price fixers or monopolists to escape liabilities.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's correct. 
    But one of the things that the Court stressed was that, if this were not the case and you had not recognized that they had the right to sue, that it would have permitted the price fixers or monopolists to escape liability. 
    The same sort of doctrine was recognized years ago in Hanover Shoe, which we think stands for the proposition that one of the major congressional purposes of the antitrust laws is to punish violators. 
    Those who are liable should have to pay, and without contribution that goal is defeated. 
    I've mentioned to Your Honors the evolution of the doctrine of contribution through the federal common law in the various areas, and we submit, if Your Honors please, that the rule denying contribution will defeat congressional intent and that it is inequitable, it is archaic, and it's unfair. 
    I'd like, if I may, to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, unless there's some questions.

 In Section 15 U.S.C. 15, which is the part of the Clayton Act that gives private claimants the right, it says that 
 "The plaintiff shall have the right to recover damages by him sustained in the cost of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees. " 
 Doesn't that in effect fix the remedy of a private plaintiff, and pretty well make it a traditional common law damages action?

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Well, certainly, that particular statute sets out a private cause of action in behalf of persons who were injured in their business for profit, and provides for treble damages. 
    There's no question about that. 
    That distinguishes it from the Cort v. Ash cases and the cases along that line. 
    They quote Piper v. Chris-Craft and those cases. 
    But we believe that contribution goes a step further.

    Mr. Cellini. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Dando B. Cellini
speaker="dando_b_cellini" startTime="1854.872" stopTime="2065.132">
    Mr. Dando B. Cellini 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This occasion marks at least two firsts for me. 
    It's the first time I've had the privilege of arguing a case to this Court, and also the first time I've been upbraided by my adversary for attempting to focus the Court's attention on the particular facts of the case before it. 
    I'm usually criticized for doing just the opposite. 
    Here, however, petitioner's reply brief starts off by saying that I have attempted to focus the Court's attention on the peculiar and purely fortuitous facts of this case. 
    That's one point in this argument that I'm going to readily concede. 
    I have attempted to do that, I've done it for what I believe to be good reasons. 
    First of all, I'm mindful of the truism which this Court has often repeated that the business of the federal courts is constitutionally restricted to the cases and controversies that come before it. 
    And secondly, I've focused on the facts now before the Court in this case, because the Petitioner has persisted in asserting a value judgment sort of argument that equates contribution with fairness and no contribution with unfairness. 
    I find that theme has been repeated consistently throughout the briefs. 
    In fact, the last words Mr. Slater said when he sat down today, the last word he said, was "unfair". 
    And I find that an ethereal theme. 
    It's without substance, it's without standards, and it can't form the basis for rational decisionmaking. 
    And I have found no better way to illustrate that point than to see how contribution would work in the facts of the case that is now before the Court. 
    Now, my colleague and friend, Mr. Slater, I believe, has given you all of the critical facts of this case, but I don't think he's really given you the flavor of the situation in which this case arose. 
    So if I might take a couple of minutes of the Court's time to go back over some of these facts, this case goes back as far as 1968. 
    According to the indictments that were handed down in 1973 by a federal jury in New Orleans, a conspiracy took place among petitioner, respondents, and certain individuals, sometime in the middle of 1968 to about the middle of 1970, in which these parties agreed to fix prices on concrete. 
    These indictments were returned in 1973; nolo pleas were entered by the companies involved and the individuals involved. 
    Since we're arguing this case on Mardi Gras day, I might point out to the Court that one of the individuals involved was a former King of Carnival in New Orleans, which is the highest honor that that City can bestow upon one of its citizens. 
    He was sent to jail. 
    Another one of the individuals involved was the president-elect of the Chamber of Commerce of the City of New Orleans. 
    As the Court can well imagine--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2065.132" stopTime="2068.006">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Are those part peculiar facts that you referred to?
speaker="dando_b_cellini" startTime="2068.006" stopTime="2190.097">
    Mr. Dando B. Cellini 
    --Well, Your Honor, what I am pointing out... the point I am making with respect to this is that everyone in New Orleans knew about this alleged conspiracy, and in 1973 a number of plaintiffs filed suit to recover damages against the parties that were charged with this conspiracy in the indictment. 
    And all of that, as the petitioner points out in his reply brief, was resolved by compromise. 
    And then, a couple of years later, in 1975, Abraham Construction Company filed this lawsuit, the original lawsuit which gave rise to this claim. 
    And in that lawsuit Texas Industries was the only party sued. 
    Now, as Mr. Slater conceded in his oral argument... don' t think that there is any question about this, there is no collusion involved here... the only apparent reason why Texas Industries was the party that was sued by Abraham Construction is because Texas Industries is the party that sold concrete to Abraham Construction. 
    Abraham Construction concluded that it paid overcharges in the amount of $200,000 to Texas Industries, so it filed suit against Texas Industries saying, give me that $200,000 back, trebled, under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
    Now, Texas Industries asserts this third party claim, and as Justice Stevens noted in the course of the argument of Mr. Slater, the mathematical computation that would be involved in working out how this claim would be resolved ultimately, if a contribution remedy ware allowed, would allow Texas Industries to keep $50,000 of that money it got from Abraham. 
    Not only would it escape all liability to Abraham, it would actually get to keep $50,000 of that money. 
    Now, what's involved here is--

    But I point these facts out because I want to make the point that in instinctive emotional reaction to this fact situation based on what is perceived to be fair, would lead you to the conclusion that Texas Industries ought not be allowed to keep all that money, ought not to be allowed to keep $50,000 and escape all liability to Abraham.

    Mr. Dando B. Cellini 
    No, Your Honor. 
    And I'm suggesting to the Court that if it considers all of these amicus briefs and considers this particular fact situation, what can be gleaned from examining all of those situations is that you need to do more than form some sort of instinctive reaction to what is fair. 
    You can't do that. 
    In some situations contribution looks to be fair; in some situations it looks to be unfair. 
    So what needs to be done is, you have to look at the underlying public policy considerations that gave rise to this statute, to this no-contribution rule, and you have to look to the practical considerations.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    I take it that what you are suggesting to us is that there are so many nuances and so many elements in this that it's something for a legislative body to weigh, not for a court, which has no facilities for hearings, to get into?
speaker="dando_b_cellini" startTime="2504.175" stopTime="2643.543">
    Mr. Dando B. Cellini 
    I certainly couldn't have said it any better, and I certainly couldn't have said it as forcefully, Your Honor. 
    I think the deterrence issue is a great example of the difficulties in assessing the policy situations involved. 
    The 5th Circuit concluded that the rule against contribution enhances deterrents, because of the uncertainty it creates among potential conspirators. 
    In accordance with prevailing economic theory the 5th Circuit said that businessmen are risk-averse; they are less prone to take a big chance of getting a small... they are deterred more by the slight prospect of a large loss than by the strong prospect of a small loss. 
    And that result comports with common sense, as well as prevailing economic theory. 
    If you could do as what Mr. Slater suggested in this case and seek contribution, you could in effect conduct a sort of cost-benefit analysis to determine whether or not it would be beneficial to you to engage in an antitrust conspiracy, and there could be many situations where it would be of positive benefit to engage in an antitrust conspiracy. 
    I have gauged one possible fact situation along these lines on page 20 in my brief, where I posited a situation where one company controls 45 percent of the market and knows that under a per capita contribution rule it is only going to get tagged with a by-head share of any conspiracy. 
    And there are a dozen people in that particular market. 
    Under those circumstances, that company with the dominant share in the market... I posited 45 percent, but you could pick any number... that company would have a positive incentive under a contribution rule to go ahead and either force by threats or entice the other companies involved in the industry to join in a conspiracy, because it knows it stands to benefit far more than it could ever lose under those circumstances.

    Mr. Dando B. Cellini 
    --It shows the difficulties involved in the policy considerations, Mr. Justice. 
    You have some of these amicus briefs that argue that we need contribution because it will enhance deterrence. 
    In fact, Mr. Slater took that position before the Court today. 
    On the other hand, you have other amicus briefs that say that we need contribution because the present rule results in overdeterrence. 
    I think the best summing up of the problem before the Court was made by the Court in the Olson Farms decision when it said, this is a complex policy thinking, that we ought to leave to Congress... and this matter is before Congress right now; there was legislation introduced in Congress in 1979 under which a contribution remedy would be created. 
    Now, Congress has not taken action on that. 
    It's pending on the floor of Congress right now. 
    But I suggest to the Court that that is strong evidence that Congress did not initially mean to create a contribution remedy when it passed the antitrust laws, and that the matter ought to be left to Congress. 
    Now, Mr. Slater reads Section 4 of the Clayton Act in such a way that he asserts a contribution remedy could be fashioned out of it. 
    What he says is, that if you don't do that, people can get off scot free, and the rule was meant to punish all violators. 
    What the statute says is that any person who shall be injured may sue therefor. 
    It does not say, in accordance with Mr. Slater's analysis, every person who was injured must sue therefor. 
    It creates a cause of action in favor of the person injured, not in favor of someone who has violated the statute and now seeks to either escape liability entirely, as is the case in this situation, or at least spread its liability among everyone that conceivably could have participated in the conspiracy. 
    I think there is no basis upon which, unlike the securities laws, a cause of action contribution could be implied from this statute. 
    And certainly the historical background of the Sherman Act doesn't suggest any basis on which such a remedy could be implied from the statute. 
    But that point has been dealt with at some length by the Solicitor General of the United States in his brief to this Court. 
    I think the Solicitor General can present that point more forcefully than I could. 
    Unless the Court has further questions directed to me I would respectfully like to cede the remainder of my time to the Solicitor General.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The interest of the Government in this litigation stems from its concern for the enforcement of the antitrust laws and particularly from its interest in insuring the continuing effectiveness of private actions under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, particularly to accomplish the twin goals of the Antitrust Act, which are compensation to the injured and deterrence of would-be violators. 
    We submit that permitting defendants to seek contribution may or may not affect the deterrence of private actions but certainly it will so complicate litigation as to hamper and perhaps frustrate the recovery by injured plaintiffs.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That's a metaphor that I would adopt, particularly in the deterrence. 
    We just don't know which way it's going to fall, and we have referred to the economic analysts in our brief, as has my brother Cellini, and their conclusions are conflicting and indeterminate. 
    But everyone is certain that to have contribution in already complex antitrust cases would almost unmanageably confuse and complicate already complicated antitrust litigation. 
    We suggest that the Congress is the proper body in the federal picture to address this subject because of its many complexities. 
    The Court in its colloquy with counsel that have preceded me has pointed out effectively that there are many facets to this question of contribution, and that it can be applied in many ways. 
    The manner in which it might be afford lends itself to at least three analyses. 
    One, of course, the pro rata amount, which depends on numbers alone; the market share amount, which depends upon how much was sold; and the other, the degree culpability, which of course, would require even more from the district judge confronted with this determination. 
    Whether one or all of these would be applied in some combination in a particular case doesn't lend itself easily to judicial determination, and is more properly addressed to the Congress, which has the capacity for fine tuning.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --I don't like to speculate about it, but the Congress at least thought it worthy of its attention in 1979 when it addressed the subject and invited testimony from interested sources and even came up with a bill. 
    They failed to pass it, but--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3079.961" stopTime="3085.270">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, the Attorney General indicated general approbation of the idea in broad terms, did he not?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3085.270" stopTime="3273.616">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --Indeed, he did, but he also stressed the complexities and suggested that it was premature to take a firm position. 
    And we think that the Congress has the capacity, at least, to receive the testimony of the economic analysts and others to inform its judgment, something that an individual district court would not have, and certainly this Court does not have, with the other matters that affect it. 
    We suggest that the proper analysis to this problem is to regard the antitrust laws, as they are, as creating statutory remedies, and we think the Court should pursue the analysis that it has suggested in other instances when it sought to endeavor whether the Congress implied a cause of action. 
    Cort v. Ash, and the Cannon v. the University of Chicago, suggest that the first inquiry should be, is the person seeking an implied cause of action a person for whose benefit the statute was enacted? 
    I think it's entirely clear, that the law violator, the tortfeasor, is not the person for whose benefit this law was enacted. 
    And to imply a cause of action for contribution for him would fly in the face of the analysis that this Court has followed in addressing other questions of this sort. 
    The Congress which enacted, of course, the antitrust laws, has revised the antitrust laws from time to time. 
    1914 was the Clayton Act, of course; and again in 1974 and 1976 without ever authorizing contribution. 
    Yet, the literature has suggested contribution before those periods, and the Congress didn't decide that it was even worth taking up until 1979 after the Professional Beauty Supply v. National Beauty Supply case, and has just begun to address it. 
    And we suggest that this Court should properly defer to Congress's prerogative the priority here and permit it to wrestle with some of these difficult problems that have been outlined this afternoon. 
    I'd like to suggest a case which is referred to on page 16 of our brief, In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation. 
    Here there were 38 named defendants in a private antitrust suit, each of which could seek contribution, and if one can only imagine the district judge confronted with third party actions of that magnitude, trying to fashion a remedy for an injured plaintiff. 
    Also, I'd like to call the Court's attention--

I think this is found on page 4 of the Antitrust Procedural Improvement Act, Congressional Report... observes that many antitrust cases take 5-1/2 years to litigate, and that the average is four years, and if one were to graft on to that burden the problem of seeking contribution, it is very difficult to determine just how far we would go.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    If Your Honors please, insofar as the question of the fairness argument is concerned, I think perhaps the statement of the 8th Circuit in Professional Beauty Supply puts the question a great deal more accurately than I've been able to do. 
    In that case, that court, considering an antitrust contribution concept, said, 
    "We believe that the question of deterrence actually cuts both ways, and on balance a rule allowing contribution is actually a greater deterrent. " 
    "The fact that one tortfeasor may be held liable for the damages arising from the antitrust violation necessarily means others may go scot free. " 
    "The possibility of escaping all liability might cause many to be more willing rather than less willing to engage in wrongful activity. " 
    And it went on to say, 
    "The deciding factor in our decision is fairness between the parties. " 
    "We conclude that fairness requires a right of contribution exist among joint tortfeasors, at least under certain circumstances. " 
    "There is an obvious lack of sense in justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of restitution of a loss for which two parties are responsible to be placed upon one alone because of the plaintiff's whim or spite, or his collusion with the other wrongdoer. " 
    If Your Honors please, there is no way that Texas Industries can be liable to this plaintiff without the joint responsibility of these respondents.

    Well, he could choose his defendant; certainly in an antitrust case he can choose his defendant, aside from the federal rules, because of the case law. 
    He can pick and choose.

    But it seems to me that with respect to a civil situation where you have a specific cause of action conferred on a particular group of persons who were injured against another group who caused that injury, then the plaintiff should certainly be permitted to pick and choose whom he wants to sue. 
    We don't want to complicate his suit in any way. 
    He can pick and choose, he can sue one, he can sue two, he can sue them all.

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    --That's right. 
    Their defense is, if they're not, if they did not conspire, then of course, there's no liability. 
    Insofar as the deterrence goes, I won't harp on that, but it occurs to us that, as the Solicitor General points out, the question of deterrence can cut both ways. 
    Certainly the argument can be made that to cause a company to be exposed to the possibility of bearing the entire risk, entire judgment, would be more of a deterring factor than it would be for them to know that they could spread the risk. 
    On the other hand, there is a much better chance of their knowing that they're going to get sued if there is contribution. 
    Because if then, if one or two or three or four of the group of coconspirators are sued, you can rest assured they are going to make certain that the other coconspirators are brought into that case. 
    So it's a question of which is the greatest deterrent? 
    Is it the exposure to the larger dollars, or is it the greater possibility of being exposed to a judgment? 
    As a matter of fact, it occurs to us that the real deterrent in antitrust matters is the criminal statute, and that the possibility of fines and the possibility of jail terms to those persons who are thinking of violating the law is really the deterring factor. 
    And if they're not concerned about jail terms and they're not concerned about felony convictions and jail terms and hundred-thousand-dollar fines, they're not going to be concerned about whether or not their employer has to pay a whole judgement or a cost. 
    Insofar as the complexity question is concerned, we certainly... certainly, anytime you add parties, anytime that you permit additional causes of action, you of course increase the complexity somewhat. 
    But the securities cases are complex cases, and they've been handled by the courts and the courts can sever, they can sever the claims, they can order new trials, separate trials. 
    There are any number of procedural devices available to the courts to permit them to handle whatever complexity might arise. 
    It won't complicate the plaintiff's suit in any way. 
    The only complexity that can arise would be the increased complexity that might be caused as a result of cross-claims and third party demands, and we submit, Your Honors, that--

    Wouldn't that be a general characteristic of these proceedings, that if you have a possible recovery over against nonparties, you'd have an additional reason for not settling in every case?

    Mr. Benjamin R. Slater, Jr. 
    Well, I don't think so because, really, what happens in these cases, though, they're long, they're drawn out, there is long, protracted litigation. 
    They're very expensive litigation to carry on, and I think that most defendants find themselves in a posture of wanting to settle initially if they can, in some way, as soon as it becomes apparent that they're going to have some exposure. 
    And I don't think that the question of contribution really is going to have an adverse effect, if you were to grant it, would have an adverse effect on settlements at all.
