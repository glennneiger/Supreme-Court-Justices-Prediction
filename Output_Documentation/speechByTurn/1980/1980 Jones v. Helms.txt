    Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case comes to the Court today on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. 
    The question presented is whether, under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, a state in furtherance of its interests in protecting its children and enforcing its criminal law may enact a statute which provides that a person who commits the crime of child abandonment and leaves the state is guilty of a felony, whereas a person who commits the crime of child abandonment without leaving the state is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
    Appellee's challenge--

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Does it make any difference under this statute whether the particular person left the state three hours after the commission of the act or three years?

    Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove 
    --No, sir, there is no time element specified on the face of the statute. 
    Appellee's challenge and the court of appeals decision is predicated on the ground that the statute distinguishes between two classes of abandoning parents, based upon the exercise of their constitutional right to travel, and that therefore the statute is void under the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Appellee is a father who was ordered by a Georgia court to make child support payments but who never did, who simply went to Alabama. 
    He testified that he did not go to Alabama for the purpose of avoiding his child support obligations but rather to attend school. 
    When he returned to Georgia to visit his child he was arrested on the warrant for the felony of abandoning his child and leaving the state, and received a three year sentence suspended on condition that he make child support payments, which he never did. 
    Instead he just left the state again. 
    He eventually became a resident of Florida. 
    Upon his wife's death he regained custody of his child, but he had some problems with the Florida authorities and moved back to Augusta, Georgia, where the child had to be placed in the Department of Family and Children Services custody, basically a welfare agency. 
    And thereafter, the appellee was arrested on an outstanding bench warrant and sentenced to serve three years. 
    After having exhausted his state remedies, the appellee filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia alleging that the statute violated his constitutional right to travel and was void under both the Equal Protection and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution. 
    The district court ruled against the appellee but upon appeal to the 5th Circuit the district court's order was reversed and judgment entered for appellee.

    Ms. Cosgrove, I have some difficulty interpreting the 5th Circuit's opinion, perhaps because of its shortness. 
    It seems to rely at some length on the Morissette case from this Court, which was simply as I had understood it a handbook of how this Court would interpret federal statutes with respect to intent and was not a constitutional doctrine at all.

    It was the 5th Circuit's opinion that without the specific intent the statute would be overly broad.

speaker="carol_atha_cosgrove" startTime="314.135" stopTime="600.370">
    Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove 
    That's correct. 
    I believe only in the First Amendment area has there been a chilling and an overbreadth problem addressed by this Court. 
    The court of appeals reasoned that inasmuch as the appellee did have a fundamental right to travel, that the statute was the subject of strict scrutiny; and secondly, since Georgia has no compelling state interest involved, that the statute would be violative of equal protection. 
    The court of appeals also reasoned that the statute was overly broad in that we had the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, URESA, which was available to vindicate any of Georgia's interests. 
    Appellant appealed that decision on September 19, 1980, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on January 26, 1981. 
    There are two issues before the Court today. 
    First, whether parents who commit the crime of child abandonment do have a fundamental right to travel in this instance. 
    And secondly, if such a right does exist, whether Georgia's child abandonment statute impermissibly penalizes that right without being justified by compelling state interest. 
    Now, turning to the first issue, it is Georgia's position that the fundamental right to travel, to migrate, to settle in other states, was never intended to encompass and protect the criminal's right to avoid the consequences of his own misdeeds. 
    Whatever the constitutional rights of criminals in other contexts may be, their rights to full and free travel are attenuated. 
    For example, if a person commits a crime, just leaves the jurisdiction, even without intent to avoid prosecution, he is nevertheless subject to mandatory extradition proceedings. 
    And in addition, many states including Georgia have statutes of limitations which are tolled the instant a person leaves the state, thus dramatically increasing the time period during which a person may be punished for a crime. 
    So, since we do not believe that there are any fundamental rights involved in this case, we submit that it is the rational basis test that should be applied to this statute and that the statute easily passes that test. 
    As this Court has noted, it is the state legislature which is preeminently responsible for defining, and punishing crimes. 
    And we submit that the state legislature could rationally have decided that a person who commits a crime, in this instance the crime of child abandonment and leaves the state makes it much more difficult for the state to bring him to justice, that that person deserves a more stringent punishment. 
    However, even if strict scrutiny test were to be applied, as appellee urges, we submit that the statute would also pass muster under this more exacting standard, for it is not every constitutional infringement, of course, that is barred, it's only those which rise to the level of penalty. 
    It's our position, of course, that this statute in no way penalizes the right to migrate. 
    Indeed, if it has any effect at all upon the right to migrate and settle in other states, that effect is purely incidental and remote. 
    For under the statute a parent is free to move to any state he wishes, stay as long as he wishes, and the statute has absolutely no impact upon him at all unless he has committed the crime of child abandonment. 
    So this statute is unlike provisions which this Court has struck down in, for example, Crandall v. Nevada, a taxing provision that reached everyone who left the state. 
    This statute is narrowly tailored to reach only those persons who have committed a crime.

    Secondly, I might mention that, unlike some of the cases, for example Maricopa County and Shapiro, where this Court was concerned with provisions which addressed themselves primarily to indigents, that this statute does not impact on those persons who are in the blameless but unfortunate situation of poverty. 
    Rather, this statute impacts on the most blameworthy persons, those parents who abandon their helpless children. 
    So we feel that this statute no more penalizes parents who simply wish to go to another state than does the existence of an extradition law or an indefinite statute of limitations.

    Well, Your Honor, of course the Georgia Legislature certainly could have done that and many states have, but I think that in not doing so they have recognized the difference in the type of crime, in that the impact upon the child is greater because the likelihood of ever recovering any support is much less when the parent--

    For not supporting. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    Of course, even if the Court were to see this as somewhat of a penalty upon the constitutional right to travel, it's Georgia's position that the statute is more than justified by our compelling interest in protecting our children and enforcing our criminal laws. 
    And this interest in protecting our children appellee does not even dispute, and it is manifested in at least two other statutes which make this same felony misdemeanor distinction. 
    For example, we have a statute which makes it a felony for a husband to abandon his pregnant wife and leave the state, whereas if he stays in the state, it is a misdemeanor. 
    And similarly, we have a statute which makes it a felony if one is to interfere with the custody of a child who is committed to the legal custody of another, and then to take that child out of the state. 
    And again, interference with the custody of a child within the state is only a misdemeanor. 
    So, I think the Court can see that Georgia is fairly consistent in this design to protect its children. 
    Turning to the interest in protecting our criminal laws, practically speaking, when a criminal leaves the jurisdiction, Georgia, just like every other state, is dependent upon extradition to get that person back to face trial or to serve his punishment.

    I'm not at all sure, Your Honor. 
    The felony provision of Georgia's child abandonment statute greatly enhances extradition for... although I'm sure this Court is aware that, technically speaking, it is possible to extradite for misdemeanors under both state and federal law, as a practical matter, the discretion to refuse to extradite for misdemeanors is totally within the governor of the responding state.

    Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove 
    --Yes, sir. 
    The appellee would not contend that there was anything wrong with a felony across the board. 
    It's simply our position that the Georgia Legislature need not make that across the board distinction. 
    As I was saying, the discretion to refuse to extradite for misdemeanors is totally within the purview of the governor of the responding state. 
    But the court of appeals has said that Georgia really does not even need to use extradition to satisfy our interest in this case, that we have the provision of URESA, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, which can vindicate any of our interests, mainly that we can obtain support for the child, or return the parent to the state. 
    We submit that the court of appeals was in error in this regard for several reasons. 
    I need to explain that all 50 states have in fact adopted some sort of reciprocal enforcement act.

    Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    But the court of appeals used as an example of the overbreadth that we did have this alternative means available to us, and I think, quite honestly, that this alternative means simply is not effective for under the version of URESA which has been adopted by approximately 10 states, there is a provision by which an absent parent can totally avoid extradition. 
    He simply submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court of the responding state and agrees to pay some child support. 
    And he never comes back to Georgia, he never sees the inside of a jail. 
    For the remaining states which do not have that automatic avoidance of extradition, many of them nevertheless have a discretionary section which says to the governor of the responding state, basically, if there has not been a URESA petition filed, you don't have to extradite this person. 
    You can require a URESA petition to be filed first. 
    And secondly, if there is an outstanding order of some type in existence and the absent parent is complying with that order, then the governor can also just refuse to extradite that person. 
    I think if we were to follow the court of appeals decision in this case, we could conceivably have a situation where a person abandons his child in Georgia, goes to another jurisdiction, and even if the custodial parent... and I might add, it is usually the custodial parent which files a URESA petition... even if that custodial parent were successful in getting that absent parent into the court of the responding state, it is more likely than not that he could totally avoid extradition by simply agreeing to pay child support. 
    And the difficulty with that... you know, one might say, well, he's paying child support, that ought to settle the problem... the difficulty is that the duty of support which URESA contemplates is not the duty of support which obtains in the demanding state, in Georgia, for example. 
    It would be the duty of support imposable under the laws where the absent parent was, and that's presumed to be the responding state. 
    So we can have a situation where the absent parent comes into court, he agrees to pay child support, he may well be a respected member of the community by now, and the court simply will not impose a large amount of support on that absent parent, and thus really defeating the order of the Georgia court, and also not meeting the needs of the child.

 Well, again, this is a criminal statute we're dealing with here. 
 And the law that you're discussing and that was discussed by the court of appeals is not a criminal statute, is it? 
 It's a statute to enforce the duty of support by making the parents supporters of the child?

    Yes, Your Honor, and it was the court of appeals opinion that we could simply use this civil statute as a substitute for our criminal statute. 
    It is our position, of course, that the state has a right to define and punish anti social conduct such as child abandonment and that we have a right, if the need be, to put this person in jail or at least to make him think that he is going to.

    --It's very difficult, Your Honor, it really is, and I think that is one of the crucial reasons that Georgia needs this felony provision of the child abandonment statute, simply in order to be able to get this type of person back if need be. 
    I think if we were to follow the court of appeals decision in this regard, our right to define and punish antisocial conduct such as child abandonment would be defeated because our right to enforce our laws is simply meaningless without an effective method of bringing the criminal back to trial.

    That's correct. 
    In sum, Your Honor, we think that the Georgia child abandonment statute, particularly the felony division, is absolutely crucial to the enforcement of Georgia's interests in protecting her children and in enforcing her criminal laws. 
    We submit that the court of appeals decision in this case was clearly erroneous and should be reversed.

    Mr. James C. Bonner, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    I want to get one thing straight, I guess, at the outset, and that is that we don't necessarily contest the opening principle, I think, that the state started its argument with, that is that there is nothing in the right to travel which protects a parent or an accused from the consequences of his misdeeds. 
    That's not our argument at all, and that's a mischaracterization of it. 
    I will concede at the outset that there is probably, in fact there is certainly a valid area here, a general area here of application of the state's police power. 
    The state can reach fugitive parents, it can proscribe that conduct, it can reach parents who use their right to travel across a state line to frustrate the state's interest, to compound an offense. 
    But this isn't that kind of statute, and the existence of a valid area for operation of that kind of statute don't save this one. 
    We need to look at the... if this were that kind of statute, then what she said about there being a reasonable connection and this being subject to the rational connection test would probably be valid. 
    But this is not such a statute. 
    The question before this Court as a preliminary matter is how this statute by its terms, on its face, affects travel.

    Mr. James C. Bonner, Jr. 
    Revive it. 
    As I say, our question here is how this statute affects the right of travel. 
    And if you look at it, any travel triggers the statute. 
    The reason... as the state has conceded, the reason for the travel is totally insignificant. 
    The time of the travel is totally insignificant. 
    It doesn't make any difference whether the man is accused before he crosses the state lines or whether he becomes accused subsequently, although for that subsequent class, obviously, you have that privileges and immunities problem, which we don't have any standing to raise. 
    But it's important to look at that aspect of the statute because it shows what the statute does. 
    This isn't a fugitive statute. 
    Bobby Helms could have crossed the state line to visit his sick mother in Alabama and as long as he was subject to being charged before or after with child abandonment, he would fall under this special felony jeopardy. 
    There is not even any requirement in this--

    Mr. James C. Bonner, Jr. 
    No, sir, no. 
    All I'm saying is that intent is one way to confine the intrusion on the right to travel. 
    Purpose would be another way. 
    Some sort of nexus... I believe that Arkansas statute or the Rhode Island statute that says he commits the offense by leaving the state. 
    But here what you've got is the exercise of a constitutionally secured right which for any reason, for any purpose, and, frankly, any time, triggers the special felony jeopardy. 
    It is like... I don't think you'd have any trouble with a state statute here which said, burglary is a felony carrying a ten year sentence but if the defendant doesn't confess, it carries 20 years. 
    Obviously, that's an extreme example, but what you've got here--

    I don't think, frankly, that there would be any problem if you had a Rhode Island-type statute where it says, commits child abandonment by leaving the state. 
    But the problem here is that you've just simply got an exercise of the right to travel which triggers it, and it's triggered even before the defendant--

    --Well, because that's a reasonable intrusion onto the right to travel, vis a vis the state's interest in having him there and prosecuting him. 
    I don't really see any analogy there. 
    But this, again, is the same situation as if Georgia had isolated, say, the right to trial by jury and made that there a special penalty of death, as in Jackson v. United States; or attaching a poll tax to voting in a federal election, as in Harman v. Forssenius. 
    This is what Georgia has done, and the reason that this case falls in the shadow of those authorities is again basically because of the wanton use Georgia makes of interstate travel as an element of this offense. 
    Wanton, because it has no nexus, has no intent, is not confined by any kind of purpose, need not have any relationship at all under that statute to the state's interest.

    No, sir, I think there are a lot of policy reasons why not, and I think that's why you've got URESA, because of the judgments that the state made that this kind of problem is better approached civilly.

    Mr. James C. Bonner, Jr. 
    --Yes, sir. 
    They certainly could. 
    Let me jump ahead to the strict scrutiny analysis which I hope we reach somewhere. 
    But if you figure that we've got a constitutionally protected right to travel here, then under the familiar formulas of this Court, it would fall strict scrutiny, and I don't mean to repeat it for your edification, but for mine, that would mean that the state would have to show that it's reasonably necessary to promote a compelling state interest. 
    The state basically, their interest here comes down to extradition. 
    When you look behind everything they can say about the welfare of the child and about the enforcement of the criminal law, on both avenues it boils down to aiding extradition. 
    But the only... the thing is that that's not necessarily compelling interest because we've got the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, we've got the Federal Extradition Act, we've got URESA, we've got uniform reciprocal... whatever it is... uniform criminal extradition act. 
    All of these serve, they completely serve that interest. 
    As a matter of fact, under the last two, Bobby Helms need not ever have even been in Georgia, much less have been a fugitive from Georgia. 
    Under all law, the caliber of the crime, the fact that it's a misdemeanor, not a felony, doesn't prevent extradition. 
    He's extraditable under all of them. 
    Elevating it to a felony doesn't apparently aid the state's interest one bit except for the argument they make that governors will treat this offense more seriously and everything if it's a felony, which is a pretty good argument if you want to make the whole crime a felony, but it's not a pretty good argument for the distinction. 
    The state fails on the necessity aspect of that strict scrutiny test. 
    Looking at it simply under URESA and everything else, it's just not necessary, and it can't promote it. 
    Even if it were a felony and the state proceeded under URESA, they would still encounter those relief provisions that the state talked about. 
    A judge in Alabama could still... or, a judge in another state, by entertaining an action brought by the father over there, could completely bar extradition under URESA, regardless of whether it's a felony or misdemeanor. 
    But in any event URESA is designed to be a supplementary kind of extradition procedure, not one that necessarily preempts. 
    I forget exactly what section of URESA it is, but the state's perfectly free to proceed under all its other extradition powers. 
    And again, under all of those extradition powers whether the thing's a felony or a misdemeanor, they still run into the governor's discretion. 
    And making it a capital felony is not necessarily going to elude that governor's discretion.

 You'd make the same argument with that kind of statute?
