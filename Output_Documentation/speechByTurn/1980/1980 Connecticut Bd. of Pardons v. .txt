    Mr. O'Neill, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is, has the practice of the Connecticut Board of Pardons in granting relief to inmates serving what we call straight life sentences in Connecticut... that is, sentences with no court-imposed minimum term... and relief to the extent that the minimum term set by statute is reduced, thereby accelerating the inmates' eligibility to appear before the Connecticut Board of Parole, giving inmates serving such sentences a due process right to the extent that the Board of Pardons must give written explanations of adverse decisions when they deny such relief. 
    This is the second occasion upon which we have come to this Court, the parties in this case have come to this Court on the issue of what, if any, kind of a written statement is required when the Board of Pardons denies pardon relief to a so-called lifer in Connecticut. 
    The first occasion followed a decision in January of 1979 by a panel of the 2nd Circuit which analogized pardons to parole, and held in part that written statements of reasons for denial of parole are part of the due process requirements surrounding parole decisions, this holding was based upon the expectation of inmates in regard to parole possibilities which lead to those inmates acquiring some liberty interest in the parole process. 
    In May of 1979 this Court decided Greenholtz. 
    We had petitioned for a writ of certiorari on the January, '79, decision of the 2nd Circuit. 
    In June of 1979 this Court granted our petition and remanded the case to the 2nd Circuit for further consideration in light of this Court's decision in Greenholtz. 
    The same panel of the 2nd Circuit, the same three judges, reconsidered the matter. 
    Parties briefed it by order of the 2nd Circuit but there was no oral argument. 
    Although concluding that the applicable Connecticut statute, Section 18-26 of the Connecticut General Statutes, offered only the mere hope of pardon, that it does not create a legitimate expectation of freedom, and hence does not implicate due process... and in this regard the panel concluded that Section 18-26 contains neither a presumption in favor of pardon nor a list of factors to be considered by the Board of Pardons, and in fact that the statute gave the Board unfettered discretion. 
    Despite these conclusions, the court upon reconsideration, affirmed its earlier conclusion, as the consistent issuance of pardons to inmates serving so-called straight life sentences in Connecticut has given inmates serving such sentences a protected liberty interest in the pardons process.

speaker="stephen_j_oneill" startTime="398.559" stopTime="1053.108">
    Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill 
    Well, following the... Mr. Gates is a very knowledgeable man and he has been around in the corrections area in Connecticut for decades... following the decision of the 2nd Circuit and before this Court granted certiorari, we did embark upon a process of reviewing the minutes of the Board's meetings for the past five or six years, I believe, to see if we could put together some kind of a pattern, but we really didn't get all that deeply into it when this Court granted certiorari, and we stopped. 
    One thing that interested me in that search is that I don't know that all inmates serving life sentences apply for pardons. 
    We get frequent applications from the same inmate, but I wonder if all inmates serving life sentences do in fact apply for pardon, really. 
    But anyway, that's not in the record up to this point, Your Honor. 
    Following the ordering of the filing of the records, as the Court has indicated, the 2nd Circuit remanded to the district court to determine how many years a lifer must serve before the probability of a pardon becomes so significant as to give rise to a protected liberty interest. 
    The finding or conclusion of the 2nd Circuit that the consistent issuance of pardons... again, from the facts in the record, somewhere around 75 percent... and it's also referred to as the regularity of their issuance... is again, as I indicated, based on the testimony of Mr. Gates. 
    In Board of Regents v. Roth, relied upon by the majority of this Court in Greenholtz, this Court held in part that the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural protection of property is the safeguard of the security of interest that a person has already acquired in specific benefits. 
    It further held that to have a property interest in a benefit a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it, he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it, he must instead have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. 
    It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. 
    In the Leis case, Leis v. Flynt, this Court further held that a claim of entitlement under state law to be enforceable must be derived from statute or legal rule or through a mutually explicit understanding. 
    There simply is no statute, legal rule, for a mutually explicit understanding such that lifers in Connecticut have a protected or a legitimate claim of entitlement to pardon relief. 
    In Roth itself there was at least a suggestion that most of the teachers hired on a yearly basis were in fact rehired, and yet that suggestion was not deemed significant enough to give the teacher a legitimate claim of entitlement, thus invoking due process. 
    Indeed, in Greenholtz itself, in the dissenting opinions, there was detailed reference to parole statistics around the country which showed, in part: that the history of New York was that 75 percent of persons eligible for parole were in fact paroled, and that the figure went as high as 92 percent in other states around the country; that the figures nationally show that some 70 percent of inmates released to the community were in fact released to the community via the parole process. 
    And yet, the majority of this Court held that there was no legitimate claim of entitlement. 
    Indeed, even other panels of the 2nd Circuit have in Pugliese and Boothe acknowledged that high percentages of parole releases do not give somebody a legitimate claim of entitlement. 
    I seem to be the only attorney who has lost this issue, at least in the 2nd Circuit. 
    In short, even if the Connecticut Board of Pardons may be generous in the exercise of its authorities, its record such as it appears can hardly be interpreted as conveying the message to an inmate serving a life sentence that he has something that he can rely on, that he has something that will not be taken away from him unless he does something about it, or unless certain conditions can be established, which are the grounds upon which such a legitimate claim of entitlement must be premised. 
    Further, in Schick v. Reed, this Court dealt with the authority of the United States Constitution of the President to grant pardons. 
    In Schick the Court characterized one who seeks a pardon as a person who is petitioning for mercy, and held that the President's pardoning power was plenary, in that it entailed the authority to reduce or alter the sentence which conditions which... which themselves are constitutionally unobjectionable. 
    Since the pardoning process is plenary, it would seem to be conditioned only upon constitutionally unobjectionable reasons. 
    It would seem that the denial of the pardon, similarly, is plenary, provided pardons are not denied, or pardon relief is not denied for constitutionally impermissible reasons. 
    There is really no claim in this case that inmates are denied pardon relief in Connecticut or that the petitioners in this case are denied pardon relief in Connecticut for constitutionally impermissible reasons. 
    The decisions of this Court which have found, in the inmate context, which have found a constitutionally protected claim of entitlement, are really not applicable to this case. 
    In Wolff, good time was given to the inmate, by law, in Nebraska; good time could be deducted only for failure to obey the rules of the prison. 
    Thus the inmate had something that he could count on, and from my experience in the Department of Corrections in Connecticut, inmates do count on good time, which should only be taken from them if they do something wrong. 
    That's not true of an applicant for a pardon. 
    I know that inmates when they are sentenced expect or base their pleas or base their defenses, or even base their conduct in prison, on the expectation that they're going to get pardon relief. 
    In Morrissey, the inmate had a parole; he was in the community; he was with his family. 
    For all but some minor restrictions he was a free man. 
    It's understandable that in Morrissey this Court held that before those freedoms could be taken from him, he was entitled to some kind of a due process hearing. 
    Again, the lifer in Connecticut has no such reasons in terms of anticipating a pardon. 
    In short, we claim that the decision of the 2nd Circuit should be reversed.

speaker="stephen_j_oneill" startTime="1103.557" stopTime="1112.631">
    Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill 
    I don't think they deny or grant pardon for no reason, Mr. Justice.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, where does the burden of proof lie? 
    If there's a problem, a man is sentenced for a fixed term, or for life, who has the burden of establishing a basis for this extraordinary relief?
speaker="stephen_j_oneill" startTime="1134.920" stopTime="1184.416">
    Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill 
    I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to your question derives from the concept of a pardon, the Connecticut Board of Pardons, such as this Court indicated in Schick, takes the position that if a man has been sentenced, there's no challenge to the sentence, no challenge to the conviction. 
    What he's asking for is an act of mercy to commute or shorten that sentence, and in short, their approach is, show us why we should extend this act of mercy to you. 
    And when a pardon is denied, in effect what the Board is saying is that you haven't given us sufficient reasons why we should do that.

    May I ask, Mr. O'Neill, is it... am I correct that the practice, or rather, procedure followed by the Board is, unless a member of the Board moves that a pardon be granted, that's the end of the matter. 
    There's no consideration whether or not a pardon should be granted.

    Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill 
    Well, he's testified that administratively, if one devised a form with four or five patented answers, it would be no great problem to check two or three boxes on that printed form, but I think he also testified that in his mind that wouldn't tell the inmate much of anything, and doesn't advance or promote any cause or any justice, it's simply a pro forma useless act, that's what I think he was really saying.

    And the answer to this question must be found in the practices of the Connecticut Board of Pardons because the Connecticut statute does not contain the "shall... unless" language the Nebraska statute, which was at issue in Greenholtz. 
    So the real issue, I think, is whether or not in the absence of a statute which contains such "shall... unless" language a state board may by consistent practice over an extended period of time establish a practice rooted in the implementation of a state statute which creates an entitlement.

    Didn't the Greenholtz opinion for the Court emphasize the key to it was the language of the Nebraska statute?

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    Yes, it did, Your Honor.

    What's that got to do with its practice.
speaker="stephen_wizner" startTime="2025.731" stopTime="2079.382">
    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if I may respond to that, this Court as you well know, in Greenholtz stated that in that case the Nebraska statute by its terms created an entitlement. 
    Whether or not such language would be necessary in future cases, the Court said, will have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. 
    The 2nd Circuit, the circuit from which we come with this case, has already had occasion, several occasions, to consider Greenholtz, and has held that in the absence of any other evidence, if you have a purely discretionary statute such as the one we have here, no entitlement is created and no legitimate claim of entitlement is created. 
    Our position is that the Connecticut Board of Pardons has structured the exercise of its own discretion that it was given by the legislature, plenary discretion in the nature of any other pardoning authority, but with respect to this particular group of inmates it has limited the exercise of its own discretion by granting relief to almost all of them.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    It would be and we think they can do that. 
    We think that as long as they are granting relief to at least 75 and perhaps 90 percent of inmates, permitting them to apply every year, the testimony from the Pardon Board Chairman was, we know that they're looking at us very closely. 
    The Board knows that these applications are being made, and establishing a very complex procedure for determining that reliable fact-finding will take place, a procedure which we don't claim entitlement to, incidentally.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2133.798" stopTime="2150.760">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, on the basis of that argument, could not an equally plausible argument be made that since you're granting 70 percent in the past, you must grant 70 percent this year? 
    I want in on that 70 percent.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner

speaker="stephen_wizner" startTime="2155.367" stopTime="2187.900">
    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    With all respect, Your Honor, I think it is not equally plausible. 
    I think that what we're claiming is that when relief is granted this consistently, it implicates a liberty interest and creates a legitimate claim of entitlement, a claim of entitlement to have applications for sentence reduction on the part of these inmates fairly considered. 
    We are not saying that the Board of Pardons has painted itself into a corner as Justice Rehnquist suggests and obligated itself to grant pardons to life inmates into the future. 
    In fact, it's hard to understand, as Justice Stevens pointed out, why it is that Connecticut is granting relief to so many life prisoners.

    --Very well. 
    We think a reason has to be given which shows... admittedly, the Board has very broad discretion, and can give almost any reason it wishes other than a constitutionally impermissible basis for denying the pardon. 
    But we think they have to give a reason which will accomplish several of the objectives of the parole system in Connecticut, of which the sentence commutation process is a part. 
    It would have to be a reason, if the denial of the sentence commutation were based on institutional conduct, it would have to be a reason which would inform the inmate of what he has to do to improve his conduct so that he might be eligible the next time.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    The Connecticut Board of Pardons would be perfectly within its discretion to do that if it weren't granting relief to almost every member of our class. 
    I think that wouldn't be a sufficient reason to--

    I understand. 
    My question is, suppose in every case from now on they gave that, 
    "because no reason has been advanced why the petition should be granted. "

    It doesn't explain anything to the inmate about why he was singled out as a member of that small group of perhaps ten percent of inmates who was not granted relief.

speaker="stephen_wizner" startTime="2696.697" stopTime="2753.939">
    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    --Here's how a state life sentence works. 
    Prior to the repeal of the Penal Code in 1971, lifers received a sentence of 25 years to life. 
    During the first 20 years of their sentence they did not receive the benefit of their good time, although five years of good time was given to them during the first 13 years of their sentence. 
    At the point where they reached 20 years, the five years good time was given to them as a lump, and they were immediately reduced to 20 years and eligible for parole. 
    By reducing the lifer sentence to 20 years at same point during the first 20 years, the lifer gets the benefit of those five years. 
    That automatically reduces him to 15 years. 
    So that Mr. Gates's testimony of somewhere between 14 and 17 years has quite a rational basis. 
    What the Pardon Board is doing in these cases is saying that lifers should have the benefit, as a rule, of good time just as all other inmates do, and the reason that they're doing it is so that lifers won't feel totally frustrated that they have no opportunity for ever getting released.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    --That law has been changed. 
    Since 1971 the Legislature has elected to give lifers minimum terms, so that some lifers have minimum terms as low as ten years. 
    With the benefit of good time they are eligible for parole after serving something like two-thirds of their minimum sentence. 
    What the Legislature did is it acknowledged that some lifers should receive minimum sentences lower and some higher. 
    However, as of July of this year, the sentence is going back to 25 years to life. 
    And the reason for that is that Connecticut is abolishing parole, as of July of this year. 
    So that the only inmates for whom this decision, a decision in this case, would have any impact, would be this small group of 30 or fewer inmates.

speaker="stephen_wizner" startTime="2942.222" stopTime="2978.895">
    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    The reason why you must get more is, first of all, when the appellate court is reviewing a decision of the trial court, it is deciding several things, but above all it is looking at a conviction for a crime in a criminal case where each of the elements of the offense has been proved to the satisfaction of the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    We have no criteria here. 
    If the Connecticut Board of Pardons said, sentence commutations for persons serving life sentences under the old penal law which was repealed in 1971, the following five criteria will be considered, and then the Board can say, we have considered all the five criteria and we find that he doesn't satisfy them, that would be enough.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    That's right. 
    Similarly, we have no such instructions from the Legislature given to the Board of Pardons. 
    What the Legislature has told the Board of Pardons of this case, basically, is you can do whatever you want to as long as it's not arbitrary.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    From what you have said so far, Mr. Wizner, I get the impression that you're saying that when a prisoner files the petition it should be in effect treated as an order to show cause directed to the Board why, to state why he should not be released. 
    Isn't that the practical effect of it?

    I will tell you why it isn't.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3092.786" stopTime="3108.796">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, then, is not the petition, doesn't it function as a direction to the Board, on your submission, that you must give me a reason why you do not release me, or else release me? 
    That's what you're asking for.
speaker="stephen_wizner" startTime="3108.796" stopTime="3136.083">
    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    I'm not seeking release. 
    I'm assuming that the Board of Pardons has a reason for not releasing my clients. 
    I'm just saying, tell them why. 
    But you're right; in that sense it's like an order to show cause. 
    I'm saying that 90 percent of my clients are getting it, ten percent are not getting it. 
    It rises to the level of you having to show us why it is that they're not getting it. 
    But then our position is, almost any reason is sufficient so long as it's a reason which explains why they haven't gotten it and it's not based on constitutionally impermissible grounds.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    It has to be constitutionally significant, although I agree with you that... I don't know if I'm agreeing with you... I would prefer, obviously, to have judges give reasons, but I think that when a state agency and a branch of the executive acts, it's different than when a court or a judge acts. 
    If a judge is acting within the discretion that has been conferred upon him by the Legislature and is imposing a sentence within the limits set by the statute and if you know what the sentence is being imposed for, which is a particular crime with particular elements, then I don't think the judge is constitutionally required to give reasons. 
    Another reason is just based on the separation of powers, I would think.

    There might well be such a reason in that case and the analogy I think of, Justice Rehnquist, is the draft evasion cases where appellate courts held that where judges automatically sentenced draft evaders to the five-year maximum sentence under the statute, the cases had to be remanded to the trial courts so that the trial judge would exercise discretion in determining what sentence should be applied to the particular offender.

    Not to my knowledge, Your Honor. 
    It's a good rationale, though, I think, and one that I would urge upon the Court. 
    If the trial judge consistently and systematically without considering the individual characteristics of offenders were to impose the maximum sentence for a particular crime, I would think that that kind of practice should be subject to appellate review. 
    I would think that, perhaps not a statement of reasons but at least a remand to the trial court to insist that discretion be exercised in the imposition of the sentence.

    Yes, it did. 
    It did eliminate judicial discretion, substantially. 
    It has done what other states have done in abolishing parole, which is to establish fixed sentences and inmates know exactly when they're going to get out, less good time, once, when those sentences are imposed.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    That is correct, Your Honor, and I am not opposed to that. 
    It seems, if I may address your question, which is not directly involved in our case, it seems to me that correctional officials ought to be applying fixed sentences and that there ought not to be so much discretion in the system, because it creates the risk of arbitrariness which I think exists in this case. 
    If there were a consistent set of criteria and a... may I finish my question? 
    if there were a consistent set of criteria being applied and fair deliberation being had on each application for parole, and there were sensitive consideration being given to the rehabilitative goals of the penal correctional process, it might be different. 
    But our experience has been, both in state and federal parole systems, that that is not happening.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    I hesitate to argue against myself, but I do not think so, Justice Powell. 
    I think the process that's due in this situation is a statement of reasons. 
    I don't think that, in view of the very broad discretion that the Legislature has given the Pardon Board and the fact that it is in effect commuting sentences validly imposed, that a full hearing is not necessary. 
    However, the Connecticut Board of Pardons now does give a full hearing with a right to counsel, with a right to produce witnesses, with a right to examine the prison file, and they even invite the State's Attorney from the county in which the individual defendant has been convicted to come and state his view. 
    And indeed one of the grounds why pardon, sentence commutation applications are denied, is when a State's Attorney vehemently opposes it because of communications he might have received from the victim's family or for other reasons.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3877.110" stopTime="3886.059">

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    I think that's true, except that... I hesitate to say that it's true, again because of the consistency with which relief has been granted. 
    If you have a situation as we do here where more than three-quarters and perhaps as many as 90 percent of a particular small defined class of inmates are getting relief, then it may be that they have to have something more than just some superficial statement of reasons when they are singled out for denial of that relief. 
    That is not the system we have now. 
    The system we have now is that the Connecticut Board of Pardons grants these kinds of hearings to anybody who applies to it, so I have to assume that I'm operating within a system in which anybody after he's served one year of a sentence may apply for a sentence commutation and that the Board as a matter of practice, deeply rooted practice over a period of some three decades, has singled out one class of inmates to give a very high level of relief to.

    Mr. Stephen Wizner 
    That's right. 
    Our... I want to be very clear about what I'm saying about that, Justice Stevens. 
    Of persons convicted of murder or related crimes and serving life sentences under a statute that was repealed in 1971, sometime during the first 20 years of their life sentence 75 to 90 percent of them will have their sentences reduced by the Connecticut Board of Pardons, and that's all that I'm saying.

    Thank you, gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
