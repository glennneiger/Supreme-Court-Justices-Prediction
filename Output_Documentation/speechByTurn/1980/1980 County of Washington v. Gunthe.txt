    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question of whether sex-based wage discrimination claims are subject to a different standard of proof when such claims are asserted under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than the equal pay for equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. 
    The respondents are former employees of the petitioner, Washington County. 
    The respondents were jail matrons who guarded female prisoners in the county jail and had other clerical duties. 
    The male prisoners were guarded by deputy sheriffs and later by corrections officers. 
    The respondents filed this case in the federal district court alleging that they had received compensation lower than that received by their male counterparts doing substantially the same work. 
    They also raised a claim that their jobs had been terminated in retaliation for making that equal pay claim and that they had been refused the right to be rehired, also in retaliation. 
    The trial court found that the jobs were substantially dissimilar on the facts, and therefore denied the equal pay claim. 
    It also found that there was no retaliatory reaction, that there were good business reasons for the fact that the jobs were terminated. 
    And those had to do with providing additional space in the jail to respond to an overcrowding problem, an ACLU suit. 
    In a post-trial brief after the facts were in, the respondents raised for the first time the claim that even if the jobs were not equal, that the great differential in pay between the comparison jobs could only be at least partially explained by sex discrimination. 
    The only evidence pointed to were the very pay scales which caused the source of the comparison. 
    The trial court held on the basis of the laws that existed prior to this case that since the Equal Pay Act standards applied and since the jobs were substantially dissimilar, that is, not substantially equal, that the judge had no authority to override the wage rates set by the employer and the union in this case. 
    The respondents appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and raised one other point of fact found in the record, and that was a statement by the sheriff of the county that at one point in time he felt that the matrons, the respondents here, should have been paid more than they were being paid. 
    No other evidence was asserted as supporting this comparison of jobs as opposed... unequal jobs as opposed to equal jobs. 
    One other assertion was made for the first time on appeal to the 9th Circuit by the respondents, and that is that they were prevented during the trial from introducing additional information to support their comparable job claim. 
    However, they have never pointed to what that evidence was nor anyplace in the record where they were denied that right. 
    And, in fact, it's hard to understand how that could be the case since the claim was first raised in post-trial briefing, not in the complaint or the pre-trial order.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    Comparable work is simply the tip of the iceberg of an open-ended interpretation of Title VII in the area of sex discrimination. 
    The concept of equal work is one that is defined by the statute and through case refinements, that's a concept that's understood. 
    But if that limitation that started in the Equal Pay Act is not applied as well to Title VII, then any theory is available to a plaintiff or a claimant to attempt to show that there was discrimination based on sex. 
    Comparable work is one of those theories and there are many versions and explanations of it. 
    In essence, it amounts to comparing the value of different jobs to the employer, then comparing the wages, and drawing a deduction from a difference between value and wages that sex discrimination is the motivation, and I think by the explanation--

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    --Very definitely. 
    There's absolutely no limitation upon the comparisons that can be drawn, only in the ability of the analysis to make any rational connection. 
    And of course, this Court is well aware of the method of proof that it has outlined and recently described in the Texas v. Burdine case. 
    The burden of proof, although it involves intent, is initially on the plaintiff only to show a prima facie case, to show a set of circumstances that create an inference that there may have been discriminatory motive. 
    At that threshold level the courts will already be into the type of a situation which Congress did not intend them to get into, and that's attempting to evaluate different jobs and the relative value of those jobs. 
    In other words, at the very threshold level of determining whether there is a prima facie case in these comparison-of-unequal-job sort of cases, the courts will have to make an analysis, a subjective analysis that Congress did not intend.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    --That's right. 
    The best example is a situation where there was just one person holding the job. 
    If the person is a female and is terminated or leaves and a male comes into that particular job, it's possible to make that comparison. 
    That's consistent with the interpretation of the Department of Labor and there are cases that have held. 
    The thing that takes the next step and makes the Equal Pay Act the sort of remedy that it should be is to recognize that if the employer hypothesizes a male employee as perhaps the next incumbent, that should be no different than having to wait until the time that that next incumbent comes along. 
    And so that the employer who makes the statement that I would pay a man more, or, I will pay you less than I would a man, has made a comparison of necessity and by definition to equal work and has shown a violation of the Equal Pay Act.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    They eliminate the equal pay standard, and having done that they leave no standard other than sex-based wage discrimination. 
    The 9th Circuit attempts to distinguish by saying that it would not be sufficient to compare jobs, as they understand it, without other evidence. 
    The only other evidence would be evidence of intent and we submit that the claimants will say that intent is inferred from the comparisons that we draw, and they'd certainly be entitled to raise that as a claim and will raise it as a claim, and that will then be a decision for the court to make as to whether or not it's sufficient to present a prima facie case. 
    But the distinction drawn by the 9th Circuit to say that they are not allowing cases based on comparison of comparable but not equal jobs is simply not warranted by the position they've taken. 
    The 9th Circuit certainly has no ability to rewrite the statute and there's nothing to be found in the statute that would say that.

    Certainly. 
    One of the problems, of course, with the comparable work question which the 9th Circuit's interpretation opens the door to is that there is no clear understanding of what sort of economic or professional valuation methods would be used to apply it. 
    And I am not here prepared to explain to the Court how it would be done because, frankly, I do not know. 
    But I do know that those claims would be available.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    That's correct. 
    The important point to remember in understanding why Congress chose this is to be the state of affairs, that is, that sex-based wage discriminations would be limited to the standards of the Equal Pay Act, is that it considered these questions in 1962 and 1963. 
    The evidence was presented to Congress in great detail that there were allegations of dual standards of pay between males and females, that there was avowed intentional sex discrimination; Congress was well aware of that. 
    Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg and his assistant, Esther Peterson, representatives of the unions, presented that information to Congress and urged that a comparable work standard, which was in the original proposal before Congress, be adopted.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    The standard was first worded as requiring that comparable pay be made for comparable work. 
    That was the bare bones initial statement that evolved to add some modifiers as to skill. 
    Congress had great concern with that, and moved to the equal pay for equal work standard and in so doing also added definitions and eliminated the per se or the strict liability character of the Act by adding, as a defense that if the pay, even though for equal jobs, was disequal, unequal, but if there was any factor other than sex involved, then it would not violate the Equal Pay Act. 
    Congress didn't do that because it didn't see the problems because the problems were not pointed out to it; they were. 
    It did it because it saw greater problems in getting the Department of Labor, the Federal Government, and the courts into the sort of evaluations of employers' wage schedules, that the Court has addressed its questions to here today. 
    That's a policy question. 
    We're not here arguing a policy. 
    We're simply saying that Congress in 1962 and 1963 addressed that policy question and decided it.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    The guideline and the subsequent opinion letters which are also reprinted in the Appendix make it very clear that the EEOC at that time felt that the equal pay for equal work standard was incorporated. 
    The position of the EEOC which it's arguing in its amicus brief and will be presenting to the Court in a moment is clearly to the contrary.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    And both before and after that '72 guideline there had been opinion letters issued directly contrary, so that there's no question but what there has been a complete reversal of the position, and of course the petitioners rely upon this Court's analysis in General Electric v. Gilbert that to the extent that the opinions and the guidelines of the EEOC are entitled to deference, it's the contemporaneous opinions. 
    And certainly where they accord with the express legislative intent, that should have the controlling effect.

    When Title VII, of course, was before Congress there was concern expressed, initially by others and finally by Senator Bennett, that the decision reached in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 might be abrogated or nullified in some way by the broad sweep of Title VII, at the time that sex was introduced as a protected classification.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    It came after committee hearings had ended in the House, while there was debate on the House floor. 
    It appeared in a proposed amendment by Representative Smith and in the same afternoon was adopted with limited debate. 
    When the bill went to the Senate it never went through committee hearing, it went straight to the Senate for debate, and so there was very little really substantive discussion of the sex amendment. 
    Senator Clark expressed the concern of others that by so doing... and since the coverage of Title VII is of course, as we have mentioned, broader than the Equal Pay Act. 
    It covers such things as conditions of employment and access to jobs... that it would have the effect of overreaching the Equal Pay Act and of reading out of it the equal pay for equal work limitation. 
    And so Senator Clark responded to that concern by his understanding of the doctrine of in pari materia construction which was simply to say that the subsequent enactment would not have that effect. 
    There was nothing in Title VII as it was then before Congress that expressly said that. 
    And that's why I say that Senator Clark must necessarily have been relying on in pari materia construction. 
    However, Senator Bennett apparently was not comfortable with leaving it at that, and so introduced an amendment. 
    Unfortunately for the benefit of legislative history, that amendment came after cloture had been invoked on the Senate floor so that, for one thing, the date was extremely limited, and for another, it was styled as a technical amendment. 
    That of course was consistent with what Senator Bennett was doing, which was clarifying, not, as has been suggested by other parties, narrowing the scope of Title VII, but clarifying what Congress expected to be the narrow scope. 
    The Bennett Amendment refers to Section 6(d) which was the Equal Pay Act Amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    And it states in essence that it is not a violation of Title VII to differentiate and pay on the basis of sex if it's authorized by the Equal Pay Act. 
    There have been three interpretations put forth for what the Bennett Amendment means. 
    The most narrow and I think one not strongly urged by any party as this time is that all it did was incorporate four defenses that are found as a part of the Equal Pay Act. 
    The reason that that can be discounted fairly simply is that those four defenses already existed in Title VII as it was proposed. 
    The first three existed in a sentence immediately preceding the insertion of the Bennett Amendment in Section 703(h). 
    The other one, any other factor other than sex, is implicit in Title VII itself, which only creates a violation for discrimination based upon sex. 
    The second interpretation, and the one that's being urged by the EEOC, is that they recognized that certainly Senator Bennett and Congress intended more than the four defenses. 
    They refer to the entire Equal Pay Act, not just the defenses. 
    And so they say that what he meant to do was simply say that anytime an equal pay claim is raised, that the equal work standard applies. 
    But that is just as illogical, taken in the context of what Congress had just finished doing the year prior... and I would point out, the same Congress... in adopting the Equal Pay Act.

    --He uses the word "exception" and in the context in which he uses it, Your Honor, it's not clear what he referred to. 
    The only way that we can interpret it to make any sense is that he intended to incorporate the equal pay for equal work standard, all of Section 6(d), and used the term "exception". 
    It's also possible that what he meant to include was the entire Fair Labor Standards Act, which would include the narrow employee and employer exemptions.

    The Bennett Amendment was adopted in 1964; the clarification came in 1965. 
    It's entitled to weight. 
    It attempts to show why the Amendment came in the limited form that it did, because of the cloture situation. 
    It comes from the author and sponsor of the amendment, it comes relatively contemporaneously, it was agreed to by Senator Dirksen, who also was instrumental in the adoption of Title VII. 
    And a bit later, several weeks later, Senator Clark, who took exception to a limited portion of it, namely the question of coverage, agreed with the essence of it, which was the incorporation of the Equal Pay Act.

    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    I believe that it's appropriate to view the Bennett Amendment as a technical correction because it was a clarifying amendment. 
    It was not a narrowing of the scope of Title VII in the area of sex-based wage discrimination, it was an explanation of Congress' intent and expectation that Title VII would be that narrow.

   Argument of Carol A. Hewitt
speaker="carol_a_hewitt" startTime="1909.221" stopTime="1980.505">
    Ms. Carol A. Hewitt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The plaintiffs in this case at trial sought to prove that the defendants had established the appropriate pay for the job of jail matron and then paid the women incumbents less. 
    The sheriff, who is one of the defendants and determined by the trial court to be an employer, testified that the appropriate way to pay the jail matrons was to pay them five percent less than corrections officers. 
    He had previously testified in depositions that he thought it appropriate that they be paid at the rate of the deputy sheriffs who, at one time, were the persons performing services in the male section of the jail. 
    At trial we sought to pursue this matter further. 
    The court terminated the line of questioning about any pay differential with the comment that, if the jobs are not equal, the degree of pay differential or the reason therefore has no relevance. 
    That is at pages 69 and 70 of the record. 
    The court also terminated testimony of two other witnesses because he preferred to focus on other issues. 
    On the appeal, the 9th Circuit--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1980.505" stopTime="1983.223">

    Did you make a proffer of what you were going to prove?

    The judge--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1985.753" stopTime="1988.877">
    Chief Justice Burger

speaker="carol_a_hewitt" startTime="1988.877" stopTime="2058.849">
    Ms. Carol A. Hewitt 
    --That is certainly true. 
    This was a calculated risk in this case. 
    The judge was impatient, and we felt confident we were going to win on other grounds. 
    I did not do it. 
    It was obviously an error, in hindsight. 
    The Court of Appeals remanded the case after reversing, stating that there should be further proceedings on the question of what kind of proof there was of this claim. 
    Therefore, the question that is being reviewed is whether Title VII prohibits wage discrimination for women by an employer paying less than the rate that he has determined to be appropriate for a job. 
    I think it's important in this case that the only issue of comparability comes because the employer sought to determine the appropriateness of wages within the jail setting by comparing one job to another and also by looking to outside sources. 
    So it's the employer's system that we are looking to, and we are saying, if the employer follows this system and determines an appropriate rate of pay, then he cannot lower that rate of pay because the incumbents are women.

    --I don't think that that in itself establishes any kind of intent because we have that situation in this case. 
    We have the matron's job which by state statute was required to be filled by women, and we have de facto segregation on the corrections officer side. 
    There were never any female corrections officers. 
    There's evidence in the record that women were discouraged from applying and, in fact, there might well have been a male BFOQ for that job, but that was not litigated.

    --That's correct. 
    There are kinds of discrimination under Title VII in wages where there is no job comparison at all. 
    The example would be a single sex occupant where the employer says, without reference to anyone else, if you were a male I would pay you less; a situation such as the Manhart situation where you have a differential in take-home pay because of the sex of the employee but it's not with comparison to any other job.

    My view of that is that that fact alone would not state a prima facie case, because what Title VII prohibits is discrimination because of sex, and the mere fact that the plaintiff is a woman and she's comparing herself to a man doesn't create any inference that there's discrimination on the basis of sex. 
    The most obvious reason is discrimination because the jobs are different.

    Ms. Carol A. Hewitt 
    All right. 
    In this case... The county in this case has established a system for determining the value of jobs. 
    That system in this particular case consisted of looking to outside markets and then doing an internal evaluation of what one person did versus another. 
    Based on that they determined that the appropriate rate of pay for corrections officers was one rate and for matrons was one class below that, which was a five percent differential. 
    They then paid the women 35 percent less than they paid the corrections officers. 
    Now, I think it's quite possible in this case that that raises an inference that there might have been discrimination involved, given the fact that all the matrons are women and all the corrections officers are men, and it's somewhat unusual for an employer to go to the problem of, go to the trouble of evaluating a job, determining the appropriate rate of pay, and then pay one group who are all women less and not men. 
    But that may not be enough. 
    That... it's possible that you have to come in and say... and I've got the sworn testimony of the employer that says, yes, I did it, just because that person is a woman. 
    Now, there's a great variance in what might might be sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination but comparing it to the standards for discrimination in hiring or promotion, the McDonnell-Douglas type of standards, the threshold is relatively low, and the Court has found that an inference of discrimination--

    --I think it's more questionable whether you have a prima facie case when you have a mix of males and females and you're paying that particular job category less. 
    I'm not saying you can't do it, but I'm not sure that it's as clear that sex may have played a factor in the different way in which the two groups are treated.

    There is nothing magical about a pay case under Title VII as compared to any other kind of a discrimination case under it. 
    Obviously there are difficult problems of comparisons and this does not limit itself to pay cases in either the Equal Pay Act or Title VII.

    Ms. Carol A. Hewitt 
    --Absolutely. 
    I do not think that there's anything in the Bennett Amendment which can possibly be construed to have such a broad result. 
    The only legislative history on the Bennett Amendment that is relevant is that which was at the same time it was enacted, and that was Bennett's proposal, that it was being introduced as a technical correction in order to avoid conflicts between the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, and Dirksen's comment that this was a good idea because it incorporated the exceptions, and all it did was incorporate the exceptions of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII. 
    There was no debate. 
    It was voted on and enacted on that basis. 
    And furthermore, even the language of the Bennett Amendment only says that it is not an unlawful employment practice for an employer to differentiate in compensation on sex if such differentiation is authorized by the Equal Pay Act. 
    I think it's very important to look at what the Equal Pay Act authorizes. 
    When Congress was considering the Equal Pay Act it thought about two things. 
    It thought about creating a standard requiring that there be equal pay for equal work, or in the alternative that there be equal pay for comparable work. 
    And that was all it considered. 
    And in both of those alternatives it had in mind a plaintiff coming in and being able to say, I make less than this person over here, and he's a man and he does either exactly the same thing or is comparable. 
    Therefore, I am entitled to recover unless the employer comes in and proves that his conduct is because of one of the four affirmative defenses. 
    Now that is a different kind of situation than is required under Title VII.

    The first three, the seniority system and the merit system, and the quantity or quality of production, are already in Section 703(h) of Title VII.

    But, I agree... I think that in the drafting of both statutes that there are some words that may not have needed to be there, but I don't think that there's anything that indicates that Congress intended the wholesale change of Title VII which the petitioners' construction would have. 
    Now, there are lots and lots of kinds of instances of discrimination which should by the clear language of 703(a) be recoverable under Title VII, but I'm sure Congress never thought of that in the Equal Pay Act, and if they thought about them they were not trying to deal with them, and certainly not at the time they incorporated the Bennett Amendment. 
    And bear in mind that these types of discrimination would only affect women, and I don't think Congress intended to completely change Title VII to so limit the rights for women and to provide protections for other protected groups.

    I subscribe fully to the theory that he had in mind that he wanted the bill not to be enacted because sex was included, but that isn't what happened, and I don't think that too much can be put for that now at this time.

    Ms. Carol A. Hewitt 
    There are women deputy sheriffs, but now that the deputy sheriffs for a time were in the jail doing the corrections officers' job. 
    There were no women at that time, so there have never been any women on the male side of the jail, but there are now women who are deputies who do the general police patrol work. 
    I think it's important to keep in mind in this case the kinds of discrimination in pay which Title VII would prohibit if the petitioners' contention were correct. 
    And that includes the situation that even he mentioned, which is someone saying to an employee, I'm not going to pay you as much as if you're a man. 
    It includes a lot of situations where you would have a discriminatory impact. 
    For instance, if an employer determined that he was going to pay extra pay for combat experience, which obviously would prejudice women, under the analysis of the petitioner, that would be perfectly all right. 
    In the Phillips v. Martin Marietta situation, you couldn't hire somebody on a sex-plus theory if they had pre-school age children, but you could pay them less because they did. 
    You could pay a head of household more, which would impact against women. 
    All of these kinds of cases have no bearing whatever on comparing one job to another. 
    It's clear that in Congress's contemplation of the Equal Pay Act, what they were worried about was, as they expressed it, legions of government bureaucrats coming into businesses and telling them how much one job was worth versus another. 
    We don't have that situation in this case because we're relying on the county's own system of valuing jobs for a starting point, and then what they did to discount that. 
    Also, that is not the situation in most of what I have described as the pay discrimination.

    The Government's interest here rests on the district court's holding that sex-based compensation discrimination is actionable under Title VII only if the particular acts of discrimination would also be actionable under the Equal Pay Act. 
    In other words, an employer could admit to a woman employee that he would pay her at a higher rate if she were not a woman, or he could give a bonus that had absolutely nothing to do with work to only male employees, or he could give a cost of living increase that bore no relationship to the duties performed only to male employees.

 Mr. Sullivan, as I understand Mrs. Hewitt's argument, she says that for her purposes she is taking the scale, wage scale, already set by the county and simply seeking to show that there has been discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII in it; and that that would not require the courts to evaluate the relative worth of the flight attendant's job versus the pilot's job, and that sort of thing. 
 Now, is that your submission also, or do you think that courts under the comparability theory can evaluate quite widely varying jobs?

    Mr. Barry Sullivan 
    Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the theory of our brief does not depend on the comparability issue. 
    The theory of our brief is that as a matter of statutory construction what petitioners say the Bennett Amendment means is simply not persuasive. 
    And once that has been decided, then the lower federal courts will have an opportunity to determine such questions as whether particular kinds of proof are relevant in these cases, which I think is the thrust of your question.

    Mr. Barry Sullivan 
    That's correct. 
    And I don't think that there is anything inconsistent in the 9th Circuit's opinion with what I've said. 
    Essentially, the 9th Circuit has said that the case should be remanded for further development of the factual record. 
    And I might add that the other decisions of the courts of appeals that have been rendered on this question are not particularly helpful in that they either reject the notion that 703(a) is left intact after the Bennett Amendment or they accept that. 
    And there isn't really very much discussion, despite the number of cases that are cited in the briefs, on this--

 Whether... what effect the Bennett Amendment had, and did it serve to say that there can be a violation of Title VII in this context only if there is a violation of the Equal Pay Act, or did it not? 
 And that, you say, is what the courts have decided.

    --I think that's the issue that's... that's correct. 
    But what I'm saying is that with respect to what constitutes a prima facie case, if you accept our construction of the Bennett Amendment, in a situation where there is no violation of the Equal Pay Act alleged, but we would submit there would be a violation of Title VII. 
    But that is a problem.

    Well, I think that in the Teamsters decision the Court said that despite all of the work that gone into McDonnell-Douglas, that McDonnell-Douglas was simply one paradigm for proving a prima facie case of discrimination, and that there were other ways of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. 
    And that's simply all we're saying here, is that that's essentially a fact-bound question in every case. 
    Some facts may be persuasive in one case; they may create a strong inference of discrimination in the circumstances of one case, and without any factual record to speak of in this case--

   Rebuttal of Lawrence R. Derr
speaker="lawrence_r_derr" startTime="3807.130" stopTime="3869.106">
    Mr. Lawrence R. Derr 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I will not attempt in the time that I have to address all of the comments of the respondents and the Government with which I don't agree. 
    I believe that with one exception those have all been covered in the brief and I would ask that my silence not be taken as consent to them. 
    The one point, however, that was raised goes to the question of how this case would be proven if it was returned to the county. 
    I would like to point out that the employer's wage scales prior to the time of collective bargaining were set by the studies and the wages that were produced by those studies were the ones paid. 
    Subsequent to the time of collective bargaining, of course, they were set by bargaining between the union and the employer rather than the impression created by the respondent that they were manipulated by the employer. 
    The real question, however, is that the respondents and the Government have not provided the answer to this Court of what will be the standard to determine sex-based wage discrimination. 
    The answer is--

    If it comes within one of the other protected areas of Title VII, it obviously is a violation. 
    If it is a matter of wage discrimination and is not a matter in which there can be found a comparison job, even a hypothetical job, which will be the case in almost every instance, then it would not violate Title VII because it does not violate the Equal Pay Act.

    That's correct. 
    And the reason that we take that position and the reason that that is the correct position is not necessarily because that that's the policy that we espouse or anyone else espouses, but Congress, Congress fully considered that possibility and others, it looked at the comparative worth, the comparative value, and it decided in the Equal Pay Act that the equal pay standard was the one to apply.
