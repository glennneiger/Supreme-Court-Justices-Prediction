    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the State of Iowa. 
    That Court held that respondent, a shipper, could to pursue a state damage action against petitioner, a regulated rail carrier, for failure to provide adequate service. 
    The question before us is whether the state damage action is preempted by the provisions of Interstate Commerce Act even the Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction or decisions by regulated carriers to suspend service. 
    For reasons set forth in an opinion filed this morning with the clerk, we hold that when, as here, the Commission has already upheld the carrier decision to abandon the line in question. 
    No state actions or damages can lie against the carrier. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is liable as vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
