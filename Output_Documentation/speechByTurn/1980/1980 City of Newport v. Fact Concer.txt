    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    We are here this afternoon to decide whether municipal governments all across this nation are going to be subjected to a new and potentially ruinous form of damage assessment, a form of damage assessment that clearly was never contemplated by the 42nd Congress. 
    It clearly is founded in no strong policy purpose. 
    And it wholly fails to accomplish any of the remedial purposes of Section 1983. 
    An award of punitive damages against a municipality lacks either a historic or a societal justification. 
    Now, an affirmative answer to the question presented... that is to say, is a municipality liable for punitive damages in a 1983 case... an affirmative answer to that question, it seems to me, will wreak havoc with the balance of governmental powers in the United States without producing any significant corresponding social purpose, even aside from the questions of division of governmental powers, what logic or reason supports a damage structure which punishes the innocent without deterring the guilty. 
    Now, going to the historic background of 1983, it is perfectly clear that punitive damage awards against municipalities were wholly beyond the ken of the 42nd Congress. 
    Up until 1871 no court in this country, with one exception... and that exception was clearly remedied very shortly thereafter... no court of the United States had ever upheld a punitive damage award against a municipality. 
    And the lawyer members of the 42nd Congress couldn't have helped but know that. 
    There was a plethora of authority on that subject at that time. 
    As a matter of fact, none of the courts of England had ever upheld a punitive damages award against a municipality. 
    If one wants to look at legislative history as this Court has done in considering the question of compensatory awards against municipalities, one only has to look at the remarks of Congressman Kerr, Congressman Butler, and Congressman Poland. 
    Now, admittedly, those remarks were directed to debate on the Sherman Amendment, but we must remember that the Sherman Amendment was aimed directly at municipalities, the Sherman Act which passed the Senate and died in the House. 
    And each of those gentlemen speaking to the question of the impact of the Sherman Act indicated that it was intended, and they believed it was intended, to be entirely remedial. 
    I believe Representative Blair said, it is not punitive or penal but remedial only. 
    And I believe that one can read that as representing the thinking of even some of the most radical members of the 42nd Congress. 
    I suggest that a punitive award would have been totally abhorrent.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    I believe Representative Butler was. 
    I think perhaps Representative Kerr was an opponent. 
    But it's interesting that they were in complete agreement with respect to the import of that Act. 
    And of course the Sherman Act was a precursor of 1983. 
    Now, the reasons why I think that a punitive award against the city was abhorrent to Congress in 1871, the reasons for that are as compelling today as they were then; even perhaps more compelling. 
    Obviously, an award of punitive damages has an immeasurable impact upon the financial structure of a city and today we have seen, like, for instance, the examples of New York, Cleveland, Boston; we know about them simply because they are matters of national interest and we read about them all the time; but I suggest that they are multiplied a thousandfold in smaller municipalities throughout this country. 
    And one only has to read the briefs, particularly of the Attorney General and the briefs of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers, to understand the real menace or the real sword of Damocles that is hanging over the heads of our cities and towns.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Well, you see, perhaps that is so. 
    If they like them I guess they can take their chances. 
    In this case Newport attempted not to take its chances, but beyond that the scope of 1983 is so broad and I'm sure this Court is aware that today 1983 cases are multiplying like rabbits.

    Yes, sir. 
    But I suggest that the reason municipalities ought to be immune from an award of punitive damages is that it is clear that the function of punitive damages is to punish someone, and to make an award of punitive damages against a municipality does not punish anyone. 
    The burden of a punitive damages award against a municipality is a burden borne solely by a taxpayer at the time the additional tax is assessed or by the person whose municipal services are curtailed as a result of having to take out of the budget whatever the punitive damage award is. 
    Those people are clearly innocent. 
    They are not the actors in this drama. 
    They are simply people who have to come up with the money.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    True, but you see, again, in Rhode Island, we will be drawing juries, any jury in our federal court comes from every city and town in the state, so in a trial against the City of Newport, for instance, the plaintiff would excuse, and properly so, all residents of Newport. 
    So he might have residents of Providence, Warwick, East Providence, sitting in a case to assess punitive damages against the City of Newport. 
    So the jury's interests are not necessarily identical with the interests of the people of Newport.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    That's right. 
    But, you see, further, a number of people who are taxpayers may not have been taxpayers in the city at the time the wrong was committed but who moved to the city before the assessment of taxes was made. 
    Similarly, a number of taxpayers in the city at the time the wrong was committed may have moved and escaped liability altogether. 
    So, again, I suggest that the imposition of punitive damages against a municipality serves really no deterrent purpose. 
    I'd like to address myself to one of the things that the trial judge said in passing on the motion for a new trial and judgment N.O.V. He said, well... and I'm paraphrasing this, now... the imposition of punitive damages on the taxpayers of the city may have an influence, a beneficial influence on the next election: they'll kick the rascals out. 
    Now, I think that's an interesting intrusion, if that is what it is, of the federal court into local or municipal affairs. 
    But, secondly, it doesn't make any sense. 
    And if we take a look at this case, the wrong, such as it was... and I suppose we're now beyond the point where I can argue that it wasn't... but the wrong occurred in August of 1975. 
    Since then we've had the '76 election, we've had the '78 election. 
    Then we had the trial. 
    We've had the '80 election. 
    And, of course, the assessment of damages won't be made until after a decision on the issue before us today is reached.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Yes, he did. 
    Yes, what he did in that case, he decided... the original award against the city was $200,000, and against the individual councilmen in varying amounts added up to $75,000. 
    And Judge Pettine reasoned, and I think correctly, if we are to have an award of punitive damages that the city could not be more guilty than the councilmen who actually committed the act. 
    What will happen if we're talking about focusing voter outrage on elected officials, the voter outrage won't be focused, if assessment of taxes is what will do it, and I suggest that that is the only thing that will do it, the voter outrage won't be focused until the assessment which will be by a council at least six years away from the act itself, and they may not be the rascals that need to be turned out at all. 
    So I think the argument that punitive damages ought to be awarded as a deterrent because they'll focus attention on the malefactors just doesn't make any sense in the light of practicalities.

    On page A-15 of the petition for certiorari which is the last paragraph of the court of appeals' appendix, where the court of appeals says, 
    "In short, the present state of the law as to municipal liability is such that we cannot with confidence predict its future course. " 
    "Where the law is in such a state of flux and there is no appellate decision to the contrary, we would be hard pressed to say that the trial judge's punitive damages instruction was plain error. " 
    "See United States v. Petrozziello. " 
    "Nor is this a case containing such a peculiar circumstance as to warrant noticing error to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice. " 
    Do you read that as a flat refusal to notice the error? 
    I thought it was a little bit fuzzy myself, that the court of appeals was not saying in so many words that we will not notice the error.

 On page A-15 of the petition for certiorari which is the last paragraph of the court of appeals' appendix, where the court of appeals says, 
 "In short, the present state of the law as to municipal liability is such that we cannot with confidence predict its future course. " 
 "Where the law is in such a state of flux and there is no appellate decision to the contrary, we would be hard pressed to say that the trial judge's punitive damages instruction was plain error. " 
 "See United States v. Petrozziello. " 
 "Nor is this a case containing such a peculiar circumstance as to warrant noticing error to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice. " 
 Do you read that as a flat refusal to notice the error? 
 I thought it was a little bit fuzzy myself, that the court of appeals was not saying in so many words that we will not notice the error.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Quite true. 
    I think the court of appeals was troubled, and I think it's interesting that the court of appeals grappled with the problem when they could have said, it's Rule 51 and we're not going to even listen to you. 
    I think, as I say, they were troubled. 
    I believe a fair reading of Judge Pettine's opinion on the motion for a new trial indicates that he was somewhat troubled. 
    And I suggest again that the Court should relax the rule here for two real reasons. 
    First of all... and again, if one looks at the amici briefs, this is a problem that is floating around all over the country. 
    And sooner or later this Court is going to be faced, perhaps in a better procedural context--

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think this is a little different because of the volume of cases in which the punitive damages issue is a real issue. 
    And, secondly, because I suppose with the exception of people who live on Indian reservations, for instance, or federal enclaves, every American lives in a city or town, and I doubt that there are many cities or towns in the United States who are not presently having some forms of financial problems, and to settle an issue of this kind early, I think, perhaps stabilizes their relationships with the Government, it gives them an opportunity to assess the kinds of things that they are going to do.

    No, no. 
    There were five councilmen, and a mayor. 
    And there were varying awards of punitive damages against them which totaled $75,000. 
    I believe there were two of $40,000 and a couple of ten and a couple of five, something--

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Absolutely, and that's the interesting thing about punitive damages, because, for instance, there was a $72,000 compensatory damage award against the councilmen and against the city. 
    Now, satisfaction by one of those of the $72,000 satisfies the entire compensatory damage award. 
    But the punitive damage awards are all cumulative, and again, this is one of the problems. 
    In Owen you decide that you can collect compensatory damages. 
    And that makes the plaintiff whole. 
    But the punitive damages as to him represent a windfall. 
    The only justification for them can be punishment, and against a municipality, as I suggest, you're really punishing the innocent.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    --That's true. 
    And the problem is, or it seems to me that the answer is, that... while I know that this Court has never precisely passed on punitive damages in 1983 cases, they're being assessed against individuals as they were in this case, all the time. 
    And so, in assessing, for instance, as against the councilmen in this case, you are making an example of them as actors, but in assessing it against a municipality you're really not making an example of anybody but the poor taxpayer. 
    I suggest that there is another reason, and perhaps it is more procedural than anything else, that militates against this. 
    As I have always understood the law to be, the wealth of the actor played a part in the assessment of punitive damages. 
    If you were a very wealthy man, the jury was entitled to know that, assess a larger amount of damages against you, because they had to do something that would hurt you, that would smart.

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    Absolutely none, and there's absolutely none against the municipality. 
    And of course the municipality's, I suppose, power to tax is limited only by the real property... at least in Rhode Island... within its corporate bounds. 
    But how do you measure what its wealth is? 
    It may have long-term commitments, it may be building a school, it may be doing a variety of things, and it seems to me that as an evidentiary point of view you would end up with weeks and weeks of discussions of municipal finances before you ever found out how wealthy the city really was or how poor it really was. 
    And I suggest that that is another reason why the punitive damages scheme doesn't fit in with municipalities. 
    But just to conclude, again, historically--

    Mr. Guy J. Wells 
    --No, Your Honor, they were not. 
    Again, I say, historically, there's no reason for anyone to suspect that the Congress intended punitive damages against a municipality; that it serves no societal purpose; and that it really punishes the innocent rather than the guilty actors. 
    There are remedies against the actors that are imposing; there are criminal sanctions in the appropriate case; there are injunctive relief; there are punitive damages awarded against an individual. 
    And to suggest that an additional award against a municipality is going to deter that individual from acting just doesn't make sense. 
    He's more worried about his own pocketbook than he is about the city's pocketbook. 
    For these reasons, I think the court of appeals for the 1st Circuit should be reversed.

   Argument of Leonard Decof
speaker="leonard_decof" startTime="1702.164" stopTime="1766.778">
    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Mr. Wells' argument is bottomed on the allegation that the innocent taxpayers would be the ones who'll bear the burden of a punitive damage award. 
    This argument could be made against every provision of 1983: the innocent taxpayers bearing the burden of a compensatory award, or the innocent taxpayers bearing the burden of injunctive relief. 
    And I submit to Your Honors that the punitive damage award is the least expensive kind of deterrent that we can buy. 
    In any given case, injunctive relief provided under 1983 will normally be far more expensive than a given punitive damage award. 
    Prison reform, for example, goes on for years and years. 
    It costs all kinds of money, into the millions. 
    It's far more intrusive.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1766.778" stopTime="1772.807">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    How does that relate to this kind of an award in this setting?
speaker="leonard_decof" startTime="1772.807" stopTime="1886.433">
    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    With reference... Mr. Wells was making the argument that the innocent taxpayer carries the burden of the punitive damage award. 
    That same argument could be made with reference to injunctive relief, or reference to compensatory damages. 
    I submit that the punitive damage award is necessary under 1983, especially since Carey v. Piphus, because of the reason that Mr. Wells and the City of Newport tried to overlook, the deterrence which this Court has acknowledged to be a primary underlying premise of 1983. 
    Since Carey v. Piphus, where the courts were struggling to find some grounds in between punitive and compensatory for awarding a substantial sum of money for, I think, what Prosser would refer to as "the petty outrages". 
    And the Court there held there could be nothing more than nominal damages for violation of procedural due process or whatever. 
    There's a whole spectrum of cases which would support nothing more than nominal damages. 
    How much is it worth to go to an unsegregated school? 
    How much is an individual's voting rights worth? 
    How much is it worth to deliver a sermon uncontrolled by any censor? 
    And so on down the line; I don't have to belabor the obvious. 
    And I submit, Your Honors, that this leaves a big hole in 1983, because these petty outrages are the easiest inflicted and the most insidious and the most difficult to guard against.

 Mr. Decof, what do you make of the language in Carey v. Piphus at 256 of 435, where it says that,

    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    What I say to that is that Carey v. Piphus, Your Honor, was footnoted to the effect that... I think I paraphrase correctly... this is not to say that we indicate that punitive damages would not be properly awarded in the proper case. 
    In Carey v. Piphus there was no evidence of punitive damages; there was no set of facts. 
    In Carey v. Piphus I think it was Footnote 9 stated that we don't mean to indicate that punitive damages would not be recoverable in the proper case; and then went on to cite a number of lower court cases, circuit court holdings, where punitive damages had been awarded and cert had been denied. 
    And in Carlson v. Green Mr. Justice Brennan indicated again in dictum that punitive damages would be recoverable on the proper set of facts and cited the footnote in Carey v. Piphus. 
    So although it was dictum, I would urge this Court that this Court has at least edged toward--

    Precisely, Your Honor. 
    Precisely. 
    And when the Court came along later... so for now there is no liability without fault. 
    Now, for us to talk about a situation which would absolve municipalities of the most egregious intentional malicious violations of the Civil Rights Act, I think we're not talking about an extension of Monell, we're talking about something that naturally comes before Monell. 
    I would think this Court would think first, of course, the purposeful act should be punished.

    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    Exactly, Your Honor; if the taking away of a good faith defense does not mean there will be liability without fault. 
    Fault must still be proven even though it may be in good faith. 
    And another corollary to this is, there is a gap between absence of good faith and proof of malice. 
    One thing that would be accomplished if punitive damages were allowed, not only would good faith be an allowable defense to the punitive damages, but the good faith would be presumed on the part of the defendant municipality because it would be the affirmative burden of the plaintiff to show, to prove malice.

    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    If... but they would have had to find that the municipality acted maliciously. 
    Your Honor points up the example, for example, of the statute which is wrongfully and maliciously enacted but carried out in good faith by somebody else, maybe years later down the line. 
    It's one reason why we need punitive damages against a municipality. 
    You may not find the person who enacted that. 
    And the good faith would be a defense. 
    Or supposing a police chief said to one of his policemen, go out on the street every night and frisk everybody. 
    Now, that policeman, if he does it in good faith, will not be held liable. 
    So there's a tremendous gap that punitive damages is the only answer to. 
    And in this case, for example, if I may continue to show how it classically demanded it, the councilmen here, besides changing their stories and going through the rules and having had foreknowledge, stated they would do it again.

    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    --That's another question, Your Honor. 
    This is another reason for the need for the punitive damages against a city. 
    One of the purposes of 1983 is to encourage injured plaintiffs to bring their actions. 
    If they can't recover more than nominal damages, they won't bring them just to recover attorneys' fees, and attorneys' fees are allowable for that purpose, to give incentive. 
    One of the reasons that, again, they might not bring them is because people on city councils ordinarily cannot respond to a judgment.

    Mr. Leonard Decof 
    --Well, you said, if cities may, but cities don't always. 
    And very frequently the individuals who have committed these acts, by the time the case goes to court, someone else is in office and they don't control the council and maybe then the city wouldn't vote to indemnify. 
    But, from my standpoint, the most important deterrent is the deterrent that goes against the city because, as I said, the city is there, it's permanent, it has some control over its policies, it can do something about these things. 
    It can see that these things are not done again. 
    I would like to finally touch on Rule 51. 
    Finally, these people had all, had indicated that they would do it again if given the chance, and so, in this case, again, when I say councilmen, the city acted through its councilmen, we have a situation where an intentional act was done, it was done with knowledge that it was wrong--

    But, again, stopping them, an injunction hadn't deterred them in the past, and the threat of compensatory damages hadn't deterred them in the past, and maybe the only thing that would deter them would be the threat of punitive damages against the city, so that the city would say, don't do this anymore. 
    Finally, on Rule 51, may it please the Court, Mr. Wells' argument to this is, this is an important question, so let's blink aside Rule 51. 
    And I submit, that argument can be made in many, many cases that come before this Court. 
    Rule 51 is a most important rule for the orderly processing of cases and I think that for this Court to say, this is a question that ought to be decided, we'll overlook Rule 51, would be an invitation--
