    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim. 
    Mr. Levy, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The appellant in this matter is a business enterprise that commenced its business in the Borough of Mount Ephraim in 1973. 
    At that time there was a zoning ordinance that was in effect. 
    The business of the appellant was that it sold at retail books, magazines, and films, and at the same time it operated an enterprise that is referred to as a peepshow operation. 
    These are booths which are individual booths which have a projector and a screen upon which images can be seen.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Is this what is euphemistically called an adult bookstore?
speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="126.630" stopTime="145.609">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    Euphemistically, realistically, and directly, sir, it's called an adult bookstore. 
    In 1976, some three years after it began this operation, it attempted to expand that operation by having the equivalent of film, or in the same location as the film, in these peepshow booths--

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    It's zoned, if I understand, sir, in two zones. 
    It has a residential zone and it provides for both multifamily and single family in a residential zone, and then it has a commercial zone. 
    The Black Horse Pike, which is the main artery between Camden and Atlantic City, cuts right through the borough. 
    For 250 feet on each side of the Black Horse Pike you have a commercial zone, and then the balance of the community is residential, either multi or single family. 
    It does not have any zone that provides for industrial use. 
    It's solely commercial.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    There are taverns, there are restaurants with liquor licenses, and within some of those there is the live entertainment about which we had some colloquy in the lower courts. 
    At the time that we went ahead and we put in the peepshow operation we did it on the strength of the content of the zoning ordinance. 
    That's the zoning ordinance that said that there was no objection at all to what has now been determined to be other than live entertainment. 
    And we were then confronted with the fact that live entertainment is not a permitted use but is prohibited. 
    And as one looks at the zoning ordinance it becomes terribly difficult to be able to find out how it is that there has been a determination of such a distinction since entertainment is not addressed in that ordinance at all. 
    It does not appear. 
    Since we are in a commercial zone, we concerned ourselves primarily with the commercial aspect of that zoning ordinance, but there is nothing even in the residential parts of this ordinance that in any way relate to entertainment. 
    Now, an ad hoc determination has obviously been made that commercial live entertainment across the board is not a permitted use, but somehow or other commercial non live entertainment, which includes the motion picture theater, which includes the fact that we have been providing in the peepshow booths a nonlive type of operation. 
    Now, to carry on the anomaly of this, if we were to go along with what has been proposed to us, it is not possible for me to show a young lady dancing alive, nude or otherwise, but that I could have taken a videotape of that earlier in the morning and I could present the exact same performance on videotape in the same booth. 
    Now, the question became, and I think it's a threshold question, do we have a First Amendment situation here? 
    Is the communicative quality of what it is that we are proposing specifically, and with respect to all other entertainment that's banned? 
    Do we have a First Amendment situation? 
    Because if we do, then the fact that there is a power on the part of the municipality to enact zoning, would not in and of itself immediately then set forth that there is no First Amendment issue? 
    What we have here is a zoning issue, but it's a zoning issue where in the very terms of that zoning ordinance, we have a burden, a restraint, an impingement, and finally a total prohibition of a form of communication.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    I've had the problem from the outset, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I cannot literally come here and say to you that this ordinance is defective as it's written. 
    As it's written, there doesn't seem to be a defect. 
    As it is being interpreted and applied, there seems to be an infringement on First Amendment rights by setting forth that everything that's not expressly permitted here, they are literally then coming forth and saying, that bookstores or means of live communication offerings are not permitted. 
    Therefore I am in a quandary because I can't say to you that this is defective and therefore has to be declared invalid, but I must say that if this is the springboard for the position they've taken, that there has to be a curbing on the interpretation that is being placed. 
    The ad hoc determination I stress, because the building inspector, who may be the source of our original complaints, changes. 
    From time to time officials do change and the next one may come along and read it even more severely and now say, from this text, even nonlive entertainment is going to be prohibited.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    No. 
    What happens is this: were we to have an ordinance before us that deals with the desire to form a noncommercial entity, I would have some difficulty setting forth that there has been an infringement upon our rights. 
    The moment the door is open to commercial enterprise, then I think the burden is on the community to justify the elimination of some and the propagation or fostering of others. 
    And we do have some rules that will set that forth. 
    One is, can they do it? 
    Yes, they are empowered to enact zoning ordinances. 
    Secondly, that it must be a purpose other than that which is the regulation of freedom of speech. 
    And therefore this is an omnibus type zoning ordinance. 
    The concept is to develop the community, and therefore it is not directed toward the regulation of freedom of speech. 
    The third aspect, however, the moment they open that unit to commercial enterprises, is there a substantial, compelling reason that's being advanced by the enactment of this ordinance and is there any other way in which that could have been accomplished, the furthering of that purpose, other than by the total ban? 
    And actually in this instance, when we look around the entire country and we realize that live entertainment is basically the rule, not the exception, it is obvious that in the light of regulation there are less stringent methods of coping and curbing live entertainment, not its total ban. 
    And if we get into the question again where a community wants to restrict something and allow others, into time, place, and manner, I submit that there must be the existence of that which is going to be regulated, and if it doesn't exist then there can't be any implication of time, place, or manner.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    According to their reading of it. 
    They claim that there is a restriction on live entertainment. 
    We have set it forth, we have set forth in our due process an equal protection of the law argument here that there is no rational distinction that has been set forth and if there be the ability to rationally distinguish between live and nonlive entertainment, we must note the compelling force that led to that distinction to see if it's furthered. 
    What is more inimical to the purposes of zoning than if we can show the same performance on film and can't show it alive? 
    Now, if we get into the questions that arose in something like California v. LaRue, where there at least were hearings and there was a full setting forth of what it is that was the concern of the community and what they wanted to eliminate--

speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="985.676" stopTime="1005.972">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    Well, what happened is that it originally got up before the court, I think it started, at least the people who were affected basically by LaRue... were talking in terms of First Amendment... and we found now that there was an interplay between the First and the 21st Amendment. 
    And then we found out--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1005.972" stopTime="1013.093">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I would think that LaRue reflects the idea that a state may prohibit the sale of salted peanuts or potato chips in a bar if it wants to.
speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="1013.093" stopTime="1129.018">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    --All right. 
    I have no problem with that, but I think before we get to that point, Mr. Chief Justice, we have a situation as to whether or not the reasoning that was utilized in LaRue is the type of reasoning that would be required, necessary, and essential in the event that a distinction was going to be drawn between the live entertainment and the nonlive entertainment. 
    What are the consequences, what is it that is trying to be avoided by drawing that distinction? 
    Is it going to be a question of traffic? 
    All communities have a problem with traffic. 
    In fact we couldn't possibly generate the traffic of a supermarket. 
    That's why we have traffic rules, that's why we have policemen, and we don't come along and ban all supermarkets because it creates a problem. 
    It's possible no matter where that there could be unruliness. 
    We don't ban every type of activity where unruliness may follow. 
    What we do is that we form other means of curbing, the less restrictive manner of achieving the purpose that's involved in the enactment and the doctrine of any zoning ordinance. 
    And this is implicit where there is a First Amendment or a fundamental right, that these must be adhered to; they must be within the contemplation of the community. 
    Here, through four courts, we have yet to hear any substantial, compelling, or any other type of interest to be furthered by the restriction on live entertainment. 
    And therefore I submit that time, place, and manner has not been able to be brought into this matter because there is no item that's recognized as being worthy, or the object of regulation. 
    Unless we have live entertainment, then we can't begin to talk about its regulation in time, place, and manner.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    They do. 
    What it also means is that across the board live entertainment is not deemed to be non protected under the First Amendment. 
    We have in the Doran v. Salem Inn cases the fact that under certain circumstances it may well be, but we haven't even been given the opportunity of determining whether in our situation, are we entitled to that protection? 
    And is there anything at all that we do that may thereafter take from us that protection? 
    We have been told across the board, from the very outset, no way; you can't do it. 
    Because we have the power to enact zoning and it is given a presumption of validity; that's it. 
    And throughout all of the documents submitted throughout all of the courts including this one, we have emphasized that this is not a First Amendment case; it's a zoning case. 
    But I submit that it's a combination of the two. 
    It's a zoning case which does impinge upon First Amendment freedoms and therefore the community now has the burden of establishing the necessity for banning totally and would equally have had the problem had it not been a total ban, to set forth how much of a ban it could justify in terms of some sort of interest which it was attempting to further and--

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    I have said that, and if that were part of the unspoken part of Mr. Justice Stevens' question, then I would have answered it the same way. 
    I understood his question to say that they were going to only rule out motion picture theaters. 
    I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that a community can set forth that it will be totally residential, and I think it might meet all of the O'Brien problems. 
    I think it has the right to make that sort of an enactment. 
    I think there's a purpose that would be served. 
    I think you could set forth that that purpose would be furthered by the fact that we eliminate all commerce. 
    We don't want trucks who are delivering, we don't want any of those things, and that it possibly is the most least restrictive method of coping with that. 
    But the moment they open the door to discount stores and gasoline stations... by the way, if you look at this ordinance, it's strange; it doesn't even allow gasoline stations as a permitted use.

    It's not listed here, unless it's an accessory use to books or stationery, which are both allowed. 
    But then you'd have to make a quality judgment of accessory use. 
    But I submit that if they wanted to eliminate all commerce, that that would be then necessary that they eliminate all commerce.

    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    I would have some problem being able to speak as forcibly about the situation as I do about this situation. 
    I would have some difficulty with some of the prongs of what I call the O'Brien test. 
    There's no question that two of those are satisfied immediately. 
    They have complied. 
    They have the power, and it is not addressed to First Amendment rights directly. 
    There are other purposes which are being furthered. 
    Whether or not they will... that purpose will be furthered by the total ban may well be something that we have to think about in terms of that which preceded the enactment and then further, whether or not there's any other less restrictive manner in which that type of purpose can be served. 
    And therefore I think there would have to be some enlargement of the proposition to include whatever factual situation there was, what it is that they're trying to undo or prevent happening? 
    But at least if they would follow the same possible course and road, and meet all of these problems that are their obligation and their burden, it may well be the courts would decide that you could have a totally residential and noncommercial unit. 
    But once the door is opened and a distinction is made with respect to any commerce, then I think you have to treat it as if it's a community with commerce and then under what guise or right could they prevent us from bringing in our form of commerce? 
    Now, there have been some other suggestions as to what it is that we might be able to do here. 
    You have to understand that at the time that we became aware of the interpretation of this ordinance, it was a consequence of being served with criminal process, so we were already in the courts. 
    A suggestion that we go ahead and get a variance I think would violate both Freedman and Blount. 
    There is just no way at all that we can get a speedy determination and the burden of proof is not cast upon the community. 
    In a variance we take on all the burdens of showing that we will not in any way transgress what it is is the purpose of the enactment of the zoning ordinance and that we won't be violating health, welfare, morals, and the rest. 
    There is a further suggestion in the documents that have been presented to you, that we have a right to go into chancery and that we can get a restraining order. 
    And what happens is that that rule in chancery deals with civil cases and we were already in a criminal case. 
    The question as to whether or not courts will begin to in any way enjoin pending criminal proceedings, Donbrowski v. Pfister being one of the cases that specifically sets forth. 
    That is a rare, rare exception. 
    It is not the rule. 
    And then lastly, when we have the entire question of declaratory judgment. 
    We were beyond declaratory judgment at that point on a civil basis. 
    We were already in the criminal courts, and declaratory judgment is that there may well be a controversy between individuals that can be resolved by means of this method. 
    So that at the time that we were presented with process, there was really nothing that we could do except go along with the process, fight it in the criminal court, raise all of the constitutional questions, and then discover that the local court said, if it's nude dancing... not live entertainment, by the way... if it's nude dancing, it's not protected speech at all. 
    Then we get into the county court, which is an appeal but called a trial de novo. 
    There we find that the court says, well, there are First Amendment guarantees involved in dancing, but they don't apply in this case. 
    And why not? 
    We were never told why they don't apply here at all. 
    And then we find that the appellate division affirms basically for the opinion of the judge in the county court, but without any elaboration or without any clarification. 
    The Supreme Court refuses our petition for certification, dismisses our appeal, and we never get a determination on the issue of First Amendment.

    Of the kind you've got here?
speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="1756.218" stopTime="1879.765">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    --My answer with respect to the theater was that if they, they cannot ban a theater if there are other commercial uses without being subject to a challenge. 
    That could be a First Amendment challenge. 
    I submit that there can be an attempt to ban other commercial enterprise which is not protected by one of the first ten amendments. 
    But that again, that type of banning would be subject to some form of review, and if there were an equivalent use in terms of whatever it be, traffic, congregation of people, littering, whatever it is that may be their concern, if there is a comparable use that is being allowed, then there would have to be a question, either equal protection of the law, or any other aspect that would then allow them to make that distinction. 
    A ration would have to come from them as to why there is that distinction, so that we don't have gasoline stations, but that we could have coalyards, and that I could go down and fill up my car with coal and take it home for my stove. 
    And I think that in each instance there is power, but that the power does not mean that there is then a necessity for an abdication of objection on the part of those who are affected by it. 
    And when we went into the question of a fundamental right where there is First Amendment, the requirement on the part of the state is not only brought to bear sooner but it's a deeper problem that they have. 
    This court has put it on the basis of careful scrutiny. 
    And every time this Court has talked of careful scrutiny, it has basically set aside any presumptions of validity in terms of an enactment. 
    It does not cloak it with the presumption of validity that would be whether or not a fundamental right. 
    And I think the two cases of the Village of Belle Terre and the East Cleveland case seems to set forth what the attitude of this Court has been in the past relative to the question of when there is a fundamental right and when there is not a fundamental right.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1879.765" stopTime="1883.217">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    How do you see the Belle Terre case as aiding your argument?
speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="1883.217" stopTime="1927.910">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    Well, in Belle Terre what we have is, there was an attempt to pass an ordinance, or there was an ordinance passed, setting forth that there would be an allowance, or a disallowance of family and friends, but that would keep the basic family unit as one that could rent, but that there could be a preventation of anyone who was not a member of the family. 
    And it was set forth that this isn't a social right. 
    The family itself is basically something that is recognized by the courts as something that should be in some way or other advanced in all the methods possible. 
    And therefore the statute itself... shall I finish?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1927.910" stopTime="1931.129">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Finish your sentence; yes.
speaker="robert_e_levy" startTime="1931.129" stopTime="1973.841">
    Mr. Robert E. Levy 
    In Belle Terre they did not sustain. 
    They sustained the prohibition against renting in terms of other than family. 
    The Court recognized as a fundamental right the preservation of the family and in East Cleveland, where there was a distinction drawn between members of the family. 
    They created degrees of family. 
    It was then set forth that that would violate the recognized fundamental right and therefore there was no presumption of validity granted to the ordinance in East Cleveland, but rather with careful scrutiny the community was put to the test of having to prove what it is that was its purpose in distinguishing between cousins because of the consanguineous situation.

   Argument of Arnold N. Fishman
speaker="arnold_n_fishman" startTime="1982.764" stopTime="2054.610">
    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    What is being decided here today is the right and power of a small residential community, primarily residential community, to determine its character. 
    In every residential community traffic patterns create major arteries. 
    The land fronting on those arteries by virtue of the traffic patterns becomes unuseable for residential use and suitable for commercial purposes. 
    At the same time the residents of those communities demand and desire that some of their commercial needs be met within the community. 
    In that context the Borough of Mount Ephraim has adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance in an effort to accommodate all of these interests. 
    There has been a suggestion here that this ordinance regulates between live entertainment and nonlive entertainment. 
    And yet if you will look at the ordinance itself entertainment is not addressed at all. 
    What we have created here is a retail zone for the sale of retail products and services to the local inhabitants.

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    --But it is correct on a basis, not that we distinguish live entertainment and nonlive entertainment. 
    It was felt, since the movies which are viewed are movies that sold by the appellant, certainly we can't regulate how these people sell their product. 
    If they want to permit somebody to view the product... in the same way that you can walk into a bookstore and leaf through the book to determine whether or not you want to buy it... if they want to permit you to view the film prior to its purchase, certainly the borough cannot regulate how they sell their product. 
    I can remember times when if you wanted to buy a phonograph record you went into a store and you took the record, you put it on a phonograph, and you listened to it. 
    If you liked it, you bought it. 
    If you didn't, you didn't. 
    There was no move against the filmed entertainment because it was felt that the borough could not regulate the way in which these products were sold.

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    --Judge Deighan's rationale as I understand it is, he found that appellant's live entertainment was First Amendment protected, but was nonetheless subject to the reasonable exercise of the zoning power of the Borough of Mount Ephraim. 
    You have to appreciate, Your Honor, that we're dealing here with a, well, Mr. Abrams indicated that perhaps there would be a community small enough and sleepy enough... I think I represent that community. 
    Mount Ephraim is less than one square mile, it has less than 5,000 people, it has less than 2,000 homes. 
    It exists on the periphery of the Philadelphia market area. 
    These uses are accommodated not only in Camden County but in Philadelphia County and in the surrounding areas. 
    We have a true bedroom community here. 
    It's got three zones, or one or two, basically, distinction, single family, multi family; and commercial. 
    And we have defined that commercial zone by listing those uses which we permit. 
    And in case there be any doubt about our attempting to establish a retail sales zone, the ordinance provides retail stores such as, but not limited to, and then it lists a lot of things. 
    So there is no... when you talk about, can you have a flower shop? 
    The answer is yes. 
    Can you have a gift shop? 
    Of course.

    For example, there is nothing in the ordinance which gives the appellant the right specifically to sell films. 
    But surely the Borough couldn't distinguish between selling records, selling books, selling films. 
    This is a zone to sell things to the community. 
    So we never moved against the sale of films, and we can't move, in my opinion, at least, against the way in which those films are sold.

    Certainly, if some rational basis for distinguishing between commercial uses can be found, then a classification based upon this kind of commercial or that kind of commercial has got to be as constitutionally sound as a classification based upon residential--

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    Well, I think there are several justifications. 
    One is that zoning in and of itself is a compelling state interest. 
    I think that the combining of compatible uses into zones and the blending of compatible zones into a comprehensive zoning ordinance of compatible zones into a comprehensive zoning ordinance is as has been said by this Court the most essential function performed by local government because it's in that way that the quality of life in these communities can be preserved. 
    Officially, the devotion of the limited amount of commercial space that a town like the Borough of Mount Ephraim has to the satisfaction of immediate needs of the residents of a borough is certainly a compelling state interest. 
    The avoidance of those problems inherent in the omitted uses of live entertainment, like traffic, crowds, parking, trash, demands for medical and police facilities, the avoidance of these things for a Borough like Mount Ephraim is a compelling state interest. 
    So at each of these levels I think a compelling state interest has been shown.

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It is submitted by the Borough of Mount Ephraim that this ordinance passes every constitutional test developed under the First Amendment. 
    We passed the O'Brien test, in that clearly the ordinance is within the power of government and clearly is unrelated to the suppression of expression. 
    These points are actually conceded by the appellant. 
    The appellant, however, denies that we advance a significant governmental interest or that the ordinance is sufficiently narrow so as to not impinge upon the First Amendment any more than is necessary. 
    We submit that we do advance a significant governmental interest, as I've said before, because zoning in and of itself is not just a significant governmental interest but perhaps the most essential governmental interest served by any local community. 
    In addition, what we have really striven to do in this matter is devote the limited amount of commercial land which fronts on this main highway through the Borough of Mount Ephraim to satisfy the immediate needs of the residents of the Borough of Mount Ephraim, and in so doing we contend that we advance a significant governmental interest.

    There are three restaurants in the town that offer music with the meal. 
    The municipal court found that that music with a meal is an accessory use and in addition to that a hearing was held on the issue of selective enforcement, which was the only testimony ever taken in this matter, and at that hearing everyone testified that those uses predated any ordinance that anyone could remember. 
    So that they would be the only live entertainment in the town, and they would be there by virtue of the nonconforming use, and also--

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    --That's correct. 
    Entertainment is accommodated throughout the County of Camden; specifically, live nude entertainment is accommodated throughout the county of Camden, and it has to be remembered that the traditional concepts of zoning... one of the cases cited in my brief is Village of Valley View v. Proffett. 
    And in that case the court said that traditional concepts of zoning envision a community as a self contained unit containing its own... or, a municipality as a self contained unit, and containing its own residential, commercial, and industrial areas. 
    Mount Ephraim, like Valley View, is on the periphery of a huge metropolitan center and it is not a self contained unit, it is, as they said in that case, merely an adventitious fragment of the social and economic whole, and as such what is really at issue here is whether the Borough of Mount Ephraim or any such small residential community has the right and the power to determine its character, what it's going to look like in the future. 
    We have a town in Mount Ephraim called Tavestock. 
    According to the 1980 census figures, Tavestock has four homes and nine residents. 
    Certainly an inappropriate town for entertainment. 
    We have another town called Pine Valley Borough, has 24 residents and 14 homes, another town in which uses of this nature or entertainment in general just doesn't make sense. 
    The county of Camden is comprised of 37 separate municipalities. 
    Some of those municipalities are the type of municipalities where this use would properly be accommodated and in some of those municipalities it just really doesn't make sense. 
    This Court in Young v. American Mini Theatres sustained a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction for the City of Detroit. 
    Implicit in that decision is that the City of Detroit could prohibit these uses or any entertainment uses or any commercial uses or commercial speech uses from the residential areas of Detroit. 
    Well, the Borough of Mount Ephraim is absolutely indistinguishable from those residential areas of a large metropolitan area. 
    The fact that we have 37 governing bodies instead of, let's say, a county wide planning board... if we had a county wide planning board, it would be extremely rational to not permit Mount Ephraim to have an entertainment zone. 
    It's just not that kind of a town. 
    The entertainment zone would most probably be located in more of the downtown area. 
    We're on the outskirts of a large market area. 
    The Philadelphia market area encompasses five counties in Pennsylvania and three counties in New Jersey, and certainly every municipality encompassed within that sprawling megalopolis does not need to accommodate all commercial uses, be they constitutionally protected or not. 
    I maintained initially that this really... I submit that there are really no constitutional issues presented in this matter. 
    I say that because it would seem to me of necessity that before a content neutral zoning ordinance, clearly valid on its face, can be held to implicate First Amendment principles, there must of necessity be some type of a constitutional showing that the use is not accommodated elsewhere in the community at large, and there should also be some obligation to establish that the proposed site of this use is at least reasonably suitable to accommodate the use. 
    There's been no showing; the record is barren with respect to that. 
    This could, for example, and does, according to the strip type commercial uses that have grown up in the town of Mount Ephraim, backs up on residences, on home upon home upon home. 
    That's an inappropriate place to place this kind of a use. 
    The Library of Congress, as wonderful an institution as that may be, just doesn't belong everywhere. 
    There are some places where that is inappropriate. 
    And the real issue before this Court is, who is to decide where these uses are appropriate? 
    Appellants' argument would have you graft on every such zoning ordinance, change the definition of every such zoning ordinance to include constitutionally permissible uses. 
    And in so doing you are really being asked to homogenize zoning at the national level. 
    If there is anything that does not lend itself to homogenization at the national level, it's zoning. 
    At the municipal level, where these zoning decisions are made, you have decisions like, let's not put the drainage ditch here because Mrs. Jones' septic tank backs up when it rains now. 
    There is local expertise that goes into the creation of a comprehensive zoning ordinance at the local level which this Court should not interfere with. 
    There is expertise that really must of necessity be deferred to.

    Mr. Arnold N. Fishman 
    I think that's probably accurate. 
    What we're trying to achieve here is to create a commercial zone to satisfy the immediate needs of the residents of the Borough of Mount Ephraim and that's what we've done, or that's what we've striven to do, and to engraft upon that definition all constitutionally protected uses would bring about bizarre results. 
    The illustration that Justice Marshall just gave. 
    Certainly newspapers are constitutionally protected, but that doesn't mean that you can put up the large newspaper factories that are necessary to create, the printing presses that are necessary to create a newspaper in any place. 
    There are some places where that use is inappropriate. 
    Now, if a newspaper could come to our courts... our courts are sensitive to these problems. 
    In the Mt. 
    Laurel decision which I'm sure you gentlemen are familiar with, coming out of New Jersey... I think it's been before this Court... we found that a constitutional right was being denied, not just by one municipality but by zoning ordinances throughout Burlington County and Camden County as well. 
    If a newspaper could come to... it wouldn't have to get to this court, if it would come to our local courts... and say, listen, we've looked at all of the zoning ordinances available and the only place we can print our papers is west of the Mississippi River, a constitutional issue has clearly been presented. 
    And if the proposed site is a site reasonably which would accommodate that use, I think our courts would be sensitive to that. 
    But there is no showing here that this use is in any way denied access to the market, not just within the confines of this one square mile, but in the community at large. 
    And so long as it is accommodated in the community at large, then this ordinance becomes just a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. 
    Time is not implicated in any way, manner directs itself to the live entertainment, and place, in one sense, is no place in Mount Ephraim--
