Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. the National Sea Clammers. 
    Mr. Conford, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This action present important questions as to the consequences of the adoption of recent comprehensive water pollution legislation. 
    One of these statutes, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, adopted in 1972 is an extensive revision of previous federal water pollution legislation. 
    The second statute involved, commonly known as the Ocean Dumping Act, adopted in 1972, and also amended in 1977. 
    This is an action brought by an association of fishermen claiming to have been injured by pollution of the ocean by some six or seven New Jersey sewerage agencies and several New York agencies, all public agencies. 
    The action of the plaintiff is couched in several counts, the major one, based upon violation of these statutes. 
    The District Court of New Jersey granted summary judgment to the defendants based upon jurisdictional and substantive grounds. 
    The Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit reversed, and remanded for trial. 
    Three issues evolved from the differences of opinion between the district court and the court of appeals, which this Court has certified for consideration today. 
    These are, first, whether there was an implied private remedy flowing from these statutes. 
    Secondly, whether private parties' plaintiffs have standing to invoke the federal common law nuisance remedy declared by this Court in Illinois v. Milwaukee. 
    And third, whether if there is such status for a private action it has been preempted by the Clean Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act in relation to the complaint in this case. 
    In view of the time constraints that I am under in this matter, I propose with the Court's leave to address the second and third issues, on which I am opposed both by the Solicitor General and the respondents. 
    The Solicitor General supports us only on the first issue, that concerning whether there was an implied cause of action.

    I see. 
    Yes.

speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="248.856" stopTime="321.820">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    That is right. 
    I turn to the second issue, which will be found to share a common rationale with the third issue as I develop it. 
    That is, whether this Court should today declare that there is an across the board remedy available to anybody based on common law nuisance. 
    An inquiry into that question cannot be approached without a consideration of the context of the comprehensive statutes as they now exist. 
    In short the issue is, should this Court now declare that there is a broad based, across the board, available to anybody, federal cause of action for nuisance in the context of the simultaneous existence of these comprehensive regulatory water pollution statutes? 
    I submit that consideration of the traditional, well known bases for the Court enunciating federal common law should dictate that such a cause of action should not exist.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="321.820" stopTime="338.663">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll resume there at 1 o'clock on that point. 
    0 [Recess.] 
    Mr. Conford, you may continue.
speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="338.663" stopTime="437.257">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I should supplement what I said before the recess by indicating that all of the sewerage agencies in this case possessed United States EPA permits, both for the sewage effluent and the sewage sludge dumping which are complained of in this action. 
    Now, as I said before the recess, our conception of the applicability of federal common law should in the context of the presently existing situation, not that which existed when this Court last decided this question in Illinois v. Milwaukee. 
    What we are now confronted with is the question of whether federal common law should exist on an across the board basis in the context of the comprehensive regulatory mechanism which is constituted both by the Clean Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act. 
    Our study of the occasions for declaring federal common law as declared by this Court lead us to the conclusion that there is no appropriate occasion now to declare federal common law of the extent demanded by the plaintiffs in this case. 
    One illustration of traditional application of federal common law is where a state is a party to an action, either a state against another state or a state against citizens of another state. 
    In that situation, based upon the Constitution, there are being no statute applicable this Court by necessity has had to declare federal common law.

    Except to the extent that it is thought necessary to supply statutory interstices. 
    We maintain that in this case not only is there not the situation of a state party, but there is no occasion for applying interstices. 
    What we have here is clearly not a situation of interstitial law. 
    We have an alternate rival system attempted to be set forth: to wit, the federal common law of nuisance, under which a judge, as Justice Douglas said in the Milwaukee case, operates according to no fixed rules but he is the chancellor, exercising his informed judgement as to what should be.

    Mr. Milton B. Conford

speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="528.395" stopTime="580.780">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    Exactly. 
    And the Court, in an effort to serve its policy of not taking original jurisdiction, labored to find an alternate basis for jurisdiction because of its felt need that a state affected by pollution coming from another state ought to be afforded a remedy. 
    Now, another common basis for applying federal common law or creating federal common law is when implicated a distinct federal policy, sometimes statutory and sometimes not, but the necessity of supplying uniformity so that the same rule applies in all circumstances, whether federal or state. 
    We submit that that criterion for the creation of federal common law equally does not exist here.

    Right.
speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="607.412" stopTime="746.364">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    Now, clearly, that does not apply here, the objective of uniformity. 
    When you have two systems, one, federal nuisance law and the other, a regulated statutory system, it's the opposite of uniformity. 
    Depending upon the plaintiff's choice to go tort law or go statutory law, you can have two entirely different results. 
    And even in the tort situation itself, there is a built in factor against uniformity, because two federal district court judges hearing approximately the same kind of a nuisance case could arrive at different subjective judgments as to whether the conduct of the defendant was reasonable. 
    So we submit, there again, there is no uniformity purpose in setting up these remedies side by side. 
    I can't think of any other appropriate federal law basis that would be applicable to these situations. 
    I think having negated those which are generally understood and generally applicable, it must follow that it is not appropriate to create the federal common law remedy which our adversaries advocate. 
    Now, that leads me to the issue of preemption. 
    We have an unusual type of preemption here. 
    It is not federal statute against state statute. 
    It is federal statute against federal common law. 
    For this purpose I assume for the sake of the argument that there would be a federal across the board common law remedy. 
    The applicable rule in this situation is illustrated by Arizona v. California, in which this Court held that notwithstanding the fact that the Court had created a common law of equitable apportionment of waters in an interstate stream, nevertheless, when the Congress adopted specific legislation reallocating the distribution of the waters of the Colorado River, that settled the question and it supplanted federal common law of equitable apportionment of water.

    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    --Exactly. 
    And we maintain that that is the situation here. 
    Now, central to this inquiry is a question of, does the reorganization of the federal water pollution act, is it of a scope which should cause a different approach than that which existed when the rudimentary water pollution statute existed prior to 1972? 
    This Court has been instructed on that question by the very able opinion of Judge Tone in the 7th Circuit, in the Illinois-Milwaukee case which you heard in December, which contains a very comprehensive discussion of the differences between the rudimentary water pollution statute as it existed prior to 1972 and as it exists now. 
    But I think the best and most pithy summary of what Congress intended to do and what thought of the old statute is a quotation from the Public Works Committee report on the 1972 amendments. 
    And here's what they said: 
    "Water pollution control in the past has been all too often sporadic, inconsistent, and improvised on an ad hoc basis. " 
    They said, 
    "Our major purpose in adopting this legislation is to establish a comprehensive, longrange policy for the elimination of water pollution, making it clear, to industry and municipalities alike what the water pollution performance will be expected of them during the coming decade. " 
    That states it better than I possibly could.

    The question is, does the savings clause in both of these statutes operate to compel the adoption of the previously existing federal common law of nuisance?
speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="931.449" stopTime="954.629">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    I say it does not. 
    In the first place, the reference is to statutes and common law. 
    In my judgment the legislature did not actually mean federal common law when it said common law. 
    When Congress talks about common law, Ordinarily I think they mean state common law, general common law. 
    Secondly--

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, isn't that true throughout the law?

    Mr. Milton B. Conford

    Does not.
speaker="milton_b_conford" startTime="967.004" stopTime="1063.497">
    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    It does not? 
    That's my opinion. 
    Secondly, the argument that it means federal law is hardly realistic in the light of the fact that the concept concerning federal common law in the water pollution area was only developed by this Court in 1972. 
    This legislation was going through the legislature and had adopted this language before the Court spoke in 1972 in Illinois v. Milwaukee. 
    And, thirdly, if it were to be accepted for the sake of argument that it did mean federal common law, that then puts the ball back in this Court's jurisdiction, because it is for this Court to say what is appropriate federal common law in that context. 
    And for the reasons which I have already developed indicating why federal common law in this area would be inappropriate, that takes care of the savings clause, I believe, completely. 
    Now, what they did mean by the savings clause, in my judgment, was state statutes and state common law. 
    For example, the Water Pollution Act specifically invites states to participate by adopting more stringent regulations, by setting up area wide water quality standards, and New Jersey, in fact, has adopted legislation along both of these lines. 
    New Jersey adopted in 1977 both a water pollution control act consistent with the federal act, and an area--

    I think so. 
    The state statute could not supersede, could not be inconsistent with the federal statute or federal regulations except to the extent that a permit could be more stringent. 
    The state could require a more stringent regulation, because the Clean Water Act expressly permits that. 
    Now, our adversaries would argue that there should not be preemption in the loose sense that I've been using the for the reason that all that the Clean Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act purport to do is to set standards but not to affirmatively, but not to constitute an affirmative policy which would be impervious to a common law action.

    Mr. Milton B. Conford 
    I believe so, three miles from the shoreline. 
    Evidence of the fact that Congress intended to give agencies involved in this situation, whether industrial or public, time and reasonable standards, not perfection, is evidenced by the fact that the Clean Water Act contains a very numerous set of time regulations. 
    Certain things have to be done 180 days after the statute is adopted, certain things have to be done 300 days later. 
    By 1977 the public sewerage agencies must achieve secondary treatment. 
    By 1983 they must achieve what is described as the best practicable waste treatment technology over the life of the works. 
    In the case of certain industrial pollutants that are particularly harmful... I'm now paraphrasing... Congress has said that there should be obtained the best available technology achievable to result in reasonable progress to elimination of pollution. 
    I therefore suggest that there is an affirmative congressional not only to permit these agencies to meet these standard, but to be given time. 
    Congress realized that a pollution situation which has developed for decades couldn't be solved overnight, that it was necessary to apply time stages in which these agencies could achieve the goal of approaching a pollution free situation.

   Argument of Alan I. Horowitz
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1371.611" stopTime="1623.835">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would first like to address the issue of the existence of an implied private right of action under the Clean Water and the Ocean Dumping Acts. 
    On this issue, the federal petitioners urge that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed. 
    The Court of Appeals held that a private right of action should be implied under both of these statutes, apart from the citizen's suit provisions, thus enabling the respondents, because they allege economic injury from pollution, to this lawsuit both for injunctive and monetary relief and against both the dischargers of pollution and the Government agencies responsible for administering these statutes. 
    The standards for determining whether violations of a regulatory statute might form the basis for an implied private right of action are by now well established by this Court. 
    The fundamental inquiry is into the congressional intent. 
    And, as this Court noted in the Transamerica cases, when Congress explicitly provides one remedy for violations of a statute, it is strong evidence that it did not intend that another private remedy be implied. 
    In this case there can be little doubt regarding Congress's intent. 
    Both statutes contain detailed provisions authorizing suits by private parties as an aid to enforcement of the statutes. 
    These provisions are modeled on a prototype enacted in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 after extensive congressional debate. 
    I will focus here on the specific citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act. 
    I believe a similar analysis is applicable to the analogous provision under the Ocean Dumping Act. 
    Section 505 of the Clean Water Act authorizes a citizen suit only in certain specified circumstances. 
    A citizen may sue any discharger who is violating an effluent limitation established under the Act or a related order of the Administrator of EPA. 
    The district courts have jurisdiction in such suits to enforce the limitation and to assess the civil penalties against the violator. 
    A citizen may also sue the Administrator himself to compel him to perform a mandatory duty under the statute. 
    Moreover, the Act establishes certain specific procedural limitations on this action. 
    These relate to notice that must be given to EPA prior to suit, to abstention from suit when the Government is pursuing its own enforcement remedies, and to venue. 
    There is simply no evidence nor any reason to believe that Congress intended to create by implication yet another private cause of action for claims that cannot be brought under the citizen suit provision, as plaintiffs' claims in this case concededly were not brought under the citizen suit provision. 
    The savings clause to which respondents point as authority for this implied right of action means simply what it says. 
    Preexisting statutory rights and common law remedies are preserved. 
    Thus, in these statutes, Congress's intent is clear. 
    Congress carefully considered the extent to which it wished to create a private right of action, and it intended to create only the right that it specified. 
    Now, in our brief we have also discussed the other Cort v. Ash factors and I will mention here only that, for reasons explained there, it also counsels against the implication of a private right of action. 
    I would like to note here, however, that a refusal to imply the private right of action sought by the respondents is quite consistent with the purposes of these statutes. 
    The primary reason for the enactment of the Clean Water Act as well as the Ocean Dumping Act was to place certain federal limitations on effluent discharges into our nation's waters, and to provide for enforcement of these limitations. 
    Congress carved out a role in this scheme for citizen participation but only as an aid to enforcement, for which the primary responsibility rests with the Federal Government. 
    Congress did not deal specifically in these statutes with remedies to compensate individuals for pollution damage that they suffer except to note that the Act did not take away any existing remedies. 
    Thus no private right of action to compensate the plaintiffs need be implied. 
    Other remedies which were preserved by the savings clause are their recourse for the adverse effect of pollution that they suffer.

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1642.446" stopTime="1677.020">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think the simplest explanation of that language in the statute is that the citizen suit provisions specifically refer to suits to enforce effluent limitations. 
    That is the only type of suit that one might have thought would have been preempted by that language. 
    Therefore it seems to me reasonable that Congress used the words "effluent limitation" again in the savings clause, just to make it clear it's referring back to the original language in the citizen suit provisions. 
    Now, certainly--

    Chief Justice Burger 
    --Whatever existed. 
    Well, isn't there some truth to what Judge Conford said that the court more or less cast about for a reason to give the State of Illinois another forum in which to try its case than this one, by saying that federal common law was available?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1827.664" stopTime="1896.410">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, the court gave many explanations for why it was implying common law. 
    It didn't say that this was to be applied, to be restricted only to cases that could otherwise be brought under the original jurisdiction, and the reason for finding the federal common law of nuisance was because of the overriding federal interest in interstate pollution; I mean, controlling interstate pollution. 
    I don't know what the court's reasoning was, but they didn't say that they were doing it solely to divest themselves of original jurisdiction in that case. 
    The State of New York has argued in its brief that the federal common law of nuisance should be restricted to cases that could otherwise be brought under this Court's original jurisdiction, but I don't think there's any basis for that and I don't think that the reasons that the court gave in Illinois v. Milwaukee support that contention. 
    I guess I'm starting to get into the second issue here, and if I can just, if I could respond one more time to Mr. Justice Stevens' question: I don't think that that was the best way to draft the savings clause, but I don't think that the fact that they used the word "effluent"... there is a rational explanation for their use of the words "effluent limitation".

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Right. 
    Now... well, let me get to that now, I guess. 
    On the issue of the federal common law of nuisance, federal petitioners urge affirmance of the Court of Appeals decision. 
    Now, in Illinois v. Milwaukee, this Court recognized the applicability of the federal common law of nuisance to problems of interstate pollution because of the overriding federal interest. 
    Putting aside for one moment the question of whether that's since been preempted by Congress, the question here is whether that remedy is available to private parties, or whether it's to be restricted to a state, the context in which it was previously before the Court. 
    Extensive water pollution does not respect state boundaries as it travels through the water. 
    Now, the Court gave several examples of previous decisions where it had noted that interstate pollution, both air and water, was an area that touched upon a federal interest and required implication of a federal remedy. 
    In the words of Judge Friendly, 
    "The interstate nature of the controversy here makes it inappropriate that the law of either state should govern. " 
    Now, given the existence of this federal common law, there is no reason why it should not be made available to private parties. 
    This Court specifically noted in the Milwaukee case that the existence of a common law in that case was not the consequence of the fact that the plaintiff was a state. 
    The interest in uniformity and difficulties in applying state law equally support the application of federal common law whether the plaintiff is the United States or a private party.

    The basis of federal jurisdiction is under Section 1331(a), because there's a federal common law. 
    The reason for the implication of the federal common law is the need for a uniform standard to apply to an incident of interstate pollution, as pollution crosses individual state boundaries.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No, because there's no federal question. 
    The federal common law of nuisance does not apply. 
    So a suit could not be brought in the federal court, it would be restricted to a state remedy. 
    Now, I'd like to make a couple points on the preemption argument which Judge Conford has focussed on. 
    First of all, it is abundantly clear from these statutes that there was no intent to preempt the common law of nuisance, neither the Clean Water Act nor the Ocean Dumping Act. 
    This is clear both from the legislative history and from the savings clause, and in the Clean Water Act the legislative history specifically referred to actions that have been brought under the federal common law of nuisance. 
    Now, the other bases that are ordinarily looked at for this Court for preemption, at least in the state context, also do not apply here. 
    There is no conflict between the federal common law of nuisance remedy and these statutes. 
    Similarly, the fact that--

    --Well, I think that's... considering the preemption clause I think it's important to draw a distinction between whether a cause of action for nuisance exists at all and what standards are to be applied on the merits in determining whether there's a nuisance. 
    Now, this Court said in Milwaukee that the standards established under the federal acts will be highly relevant to determining whether a nuisance exists. 
    Now, if there's a permit... and I should point out that in this case the complaint alleges that the discharges were in violation of permits, so there really is no defense at all because of the permit. 
    If there's a permit, then that permit is relevant in determining whether there is a nuisance to the extent of what EPA considered in issuing the permit.

    Just one question, if I may, before you sit down. 
    On this matter of uniformity that you seem to press, taking Mr. Justice Rehnquist's illustration: one district judge has imposed a more stringent standard; the one in the next district might go the other way. 
    Is that not so? 
    Another district judge in the same circuit? 
    And until the circuit settled it, you'd have no uniformity.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="2318.357" stopTime="2368.789">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Well, perhaps there's a little confusion here. 
    The choices, as I understand it, the municipal petitioners are not arguing that there is no nuisance remedy, the question is whether there is a federal remedy or whether the plaintiffs must resort to a state remedy. 
    So if the goal of uniformity is advanced by having a federal remedy, in a case like this where you have pollution and pollution effects in two different states as well as in the ocean, if there's a federal remedy, this can all be resolved by one judge in one court in one action. 
    If there are state remedies there will have to be a suit in New York, I suppose, a suit in New Jersey, possibly a suit in federal court. 
    And the result may be three different determinations by three different standards, all to the same conduct. 
    So, in that sense, I think the uniformity rationale is much better served by federal action.

    Now, it's possible that you would have a different standard applied in some suit in the State of Washington and in some suit in the State of Florida, but the Clean Water Act itself takes account of that sort of disparity. 
    It entitles states to have their own more stringent limitations Thank you.

   Argument of Robert P. Corbin
speaker="robert_p_corbin" startTime="2412.332" stopTime="2664.598">
    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    A brief review of the factual background of this case that is submitted is helpful to a full consideration of the significant environmental issues present. 
    My clients are the National Sea Clammers Association and Mr. Gosta Lovgren, individuals who are commercial fishermen and ply their trade in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean immediately adjacent to the State of New Jersey. 
    During the summer of 1976 there occurred what may be described as a rapid and massive growth of algae in the geographic area ranging from the southwest portion of Long Island to a point approximately due east of the southern tip of the State of New Jersey. 
    Specifically, what we complain about is that when this massive algal bloom died, it settled on the ocean floor creating a condition of oxygen deficiency or anoxia in and about the waters on the ocean floor. 
    As a result, there was a tremendous amount of death and destruction to the marine and other life of the ocean, and particularly with respect to the ocean bottom dwellers who were not equipped to escape the blighted area. 
    The impact of this algal bloom was especially deleterious since July is the normal spawning season, so it had an impact not only on the existing stocks of fish and shellfish but future stocks of marine life in and about the blighted area. 
    As a result of this the commercial fishing/clamming related industries were virtually destroyed. 
    In their complaint we have alleged that this algal bloom resulted from two differing types of conduct. 
    It was first alleged that the City of New York and various other New York and New Jersey municipalities discharge sewage sludge and other waste materials, many of which are highly toxic, into the Hudson River and New York Harbor where it is then carried out into the Atlantic Ocean. 
    The second and somewhat different aspect of the causal part of this problem arises from the fact that various municipalities ostensibly under the aegis of the Army Corps of Engineers directly dump similar materials, including very highly toxic substances, directly into the Atlantic Ocean where it was actually transported out by boat and by barge. 
    Of the three issues that this Court designated to entertain argument on, we first present argument with respect to our position that the federal common law of nuisance has not been preempted since this Court's first recognition of that remedy in the leading decision of Illinois v. City of Milwaukee. 
    As we have indicated in our brief, there are at least three arguments which we maintain compel the conclusion that the federal common law of nuisance not only continues but is available for my clients in this case. 
    First, an analysis of the two statutes, of the two environmental statutes with which we are involved. 
    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and its amendments, and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act indicate that where Congress has chosen to preempt an area either entirely or partially, it has done so expressly. 
    To cite but two examples. 
    First, under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as I believe Judge Conford has already noted, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act has preempted the authority of a state, of any municipality within the state, or of any similar agency from adopting or enforcing... yes, sir? 
    from adopting or enforcing any effluent standard or limitation less stringent than that adopted pursuant to the authority of the federal statutes.

    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I believe they would have been much more explicit. 
    I would further suggest that that provision of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act must also be read in conjunction with the savings clause of that statute, which I believe is even clearer statutory language to this Court that they did not intend to preempt the rights and remedies that already existed at the time that the savings clause was enacted. 
    I would also submit that there is nothing in the savings clause which indicates, other than perhaps the misnomer which has been attached to it, to suggest that that only reserved rights and remedies which existed as of the time it was enacted, as opposed to the rights and remedies which would grow out of a developing state or federal common law of nuisance or in other environmental areas--

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    --I would certainly concede, Your Honor, that that argument was made, but with respect, we would submit that if that time is ever going to come, it certainly hasn't come now. 
    I think at the time the federal environmental statutes were enacted, at least a part of the congressional purpose and design was the recognition that the previously existing statutes were inadequate in a number of respects, not the least of which was the fact that whereas the previous emphasis for environmental protection was thrust upon the states, it was determined that for whatever reason the states were simply not carrying out those dictates. 
    I think that a careful reading of the provisions of the two statutes, the Clean Water Act and amendments, and the Ocean Dumping Act, indicates that the approach currently taken by Congress is to afford a full panoply of federal protection, but that that protection to be provided is not antagonistic but rather will be coextensive with the availability of private enforcement, particularly in the context of this suit where you have individuals who are not just claiming that the water that was polluted smelled bad, that they couldn't fish or boat or enjoy other recreational activities normally attendant with the Atlantic Ocean. 
    These men's businesses were destroyed.

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    I would submit, respectfully, Your Honor, that indeed Congress did endorse precisely that, namely, the continued availability of the private damage remedy where damages can be shown. 
    We have cited in our brief from the 1972 Senate report which considered the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and clearly and unambiguously indicated that the private damage remedy remains where damages could be shown, as indeed we maintain our clients can show. 
    And they also indicated that compliance with the requirements of the Act would not be a defense to a common law action for damages. 
    So, I think, as I attempted to indicate earlier, Congress declared, took a completely different approach from the earlier approach. 
    Yes, there would be a full panoply, a comprehensive regulatory and statutory framework. 
    Far from viewing the continued existence of a private remedy as being antagonistic to that, as I believe my opponent has suggested, Congress chose to permit that as a welcome conflict, if indeed there was a conflict.

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I believe I was proceeding into the second point of our argument, namely, that the clauses... I hesitate to use the word 1972, we submit clearly and unambiguously indicates that, yes, in a sense, these were savings clauses, because they most certainly preserved all rights and remedies existing as of the date the statute was enacted. 
    However, they do not have, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested, a time lock to preclude the continued availability of new rights and remedies which might be developed in the future by judge made law under the federal common law of nuisance.

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    I would not believe that to be the case, sir, particularly if one remembers the history of the development of this statute. 
    The previous statute was, I believe, woefully inadequate both with respect to the scope of area covered as well as the inadequate remedies which were provided. 
    Indeed, that was one of the very reasons cited by this Court in its decision in Illinois v. City of Milwaukee where there was not even a mandatory conciliation or arbitration type provision with respect to disputes over interstate pollution.

    Yes, I do, sir, and I would submit that that so called conflict, we certainly recognize it as a real one, but would submit that the conflict of that nature already exists and indeed my opponent urges that it continue to exist. 
    We submit that there is no greater conflict or potential conflict with respect to what we are asking than the situation exists under Illinois v. City of Milwaukee where in your example, if I may borrow it, sir, the judge says, well, I can't award damages, but I'm going to order you to completely stop dumping, and therefore be limited to injunctive relief. 
    I believe that that capability, that potential for conflict, is indeed welcome. 
    To cite but another example, that under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act the states are free to adopt more stringent limitations, effluent limitations, than are prescribed, if at all, under the federal statute.

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    Well, before that question is reached, sir, I believe that there is a further safeguard for that person, and that is particularly with respect to the standards to be applied to determine whether something is in violation of the federal common law of nuisance or, indeed, constitutes a public nuisance. 
    Though we don't believe it's necessary for this Court to reach the issue, we would certainly be satisfied if this Court were to adopt the standard suggested by the 3rd Circuit which, as you know, was the restatement of torts, definition of a public nuisance. 
    Not only must the existence of the public nuisance be determined, but the comments, the official comments to that restatement provision suggest that where, as our opponents have suggested, there is a comprehensive legislative or regulatory framework which has been imposed to prescribe or regulate a given conduct, the courts are especially loath to describe the conduct regulated as being a violation of a common law. 
    So I do not see that there would be any particular difficulty with a federal judge being confronted with that situation. 
    We will frankly concede that we have, even if this Court were to affirm the findings of the 3rd Circuit, my clients have a difficult road ahead of them in terms of the evidentiary burdens to be overcome. 
    We would only ask that we be given the opportunity to meet those burdens at trial. 
    One other comment which I wish to address with respect to the continued need for the federal common law of nuisance. 
    As my opponent has indicated previously, the state authority to regulate to the extent to which it exists at all on the Atlantic Ocean goes no further out than the three mile limit. 
    We have alleged in our complaint a situation where there is a certain degree of pollution within that three mile limit, but there is also a certain degree of pollution from this algal bloom in the next area going geographically from the shore, and that is in the 12-mile-limit area. 
    We submit that the only law which can apply in that area within the 12-mile limit in which the states do not have any authority to regulate has to be the federal common law of nuisance, and indeed the geographic area, or at least a portion thereof, which was affected is precisely one of the remaining interstices in which the federal common law must apply.

    --Well, the difficulty with that, Your Honor, as we argued unsuccessfully to the district court, somewhat more successfully to the 3rd Circuit... as Your Honor may recall, the &lt;third&gt; [= 3rd] Circuit indicated that could have been an alternate basis to support our federal statutory claims. 
    We filed our complaint in January of '77. 
    The conduct about which we complain, and its effect, was over by the fall of 1977. 
    It was rather futile to request an end to the activity that had already destroyed the fishing industry off the coast of New Jersey.

    Mr. Robert P. Corbin 
    That's correct, sir. 
    And, I may also add that neither of the two statutes permitted private damage claims. 
    Contrary to the assertions of Judge Conford that what we were seeking is a broad and far ranging sort of relief, the relief which we request and which we submit we are entitled to under the federal common law of nuisance is going to involve a relatively small class of individuals. 
    We request this Court not to adopt the narrow and overly restrictive reading of the rationale of this Court's 1972 decision of Illinois v. City of Milwaukee. 
    As that Court indicated, it was not merely the character of the parties, the fact that a plaintiff was suing a sovereign entity not within its own jurisdiction, that led the Court to apply the federal common law of nuisance. 
    The Court held there, and we maintain that holding is applicable here, that where there are, such as here, an involvement of an interstate waterway, particularly a situation where there is truly an interstice, or actually, a vacuum, with respect to the non application of any other law other than the federal common law of nuisance, that certainly the rationale of the City of Milwaukee decision remains. 
    I believe my time has ended, unless there are any questions. 
    Thank you.
