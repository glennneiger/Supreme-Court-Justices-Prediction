    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case, like the one that follows it, involves several challenges to the constitutionality of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. 
    This case is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. 
    The original plaintiffs were an association of coal mining companies and 63 of its members. 
    The Commonwealth of Virginia intervened as a plaintiff in the District Court. 
    The primary constitutional provisions involved are the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8; the Tenth Amendment; and the Just Compensation and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. 
    I plan to address the constitutional questions in that order after I first describe the statutory provisions that are at issue here in the overall statutory scheme for regulating surface mining of coal. 
    For present purposes the critical portion of the statute is Title V which is entitled, 
    "Control of Environmental Impacts of Surface Coal Mining. " 
    Section 501 of the Act establishes a two-stage program for the regulation of surface mining. 
    During the initial stage, also called the interim stage in the Secretary's regulations, mine operators are required to comply with only some of the performance standards set up by the Act. 
    Among the ones applicable during this interim stage are the so-called steep slope provisions in Section 515(d). 
    They apply to surface mining on slopes greater than 20 degrees. 
    They require mine operators to avoid the placement of debris, spoil material, or abandoned equipment on the downslope beneath the mining cut. 
    They further require restoration of the mining site to its approximate original contour after mining is completed, and complete coverage of the so-called high wall, which is the vertical face of the mine cut. 
    Another portion of the Act that becomes immediately effective during the interim period is Section 522(e), particularly 522(e)(4) and (5), which with various qualifications and exceptions prohibit surface mining altogether within specified distances of roads, schools, churches, parks, public buildings, and cemeteries. 
    During the interim period the Secretary of the Interior is primarily responsible for enforcing the Act. 
    The interim regulatory program remains in effect in each state until a permanent program has been established in that state. 
    States wishing to assume primary responsibility for regulation of surface coal mining during the permanent phase must submit to the Secretary a proposed permanent program demonstrating, first, that the state legislature has adopted the necessary laws implementing the environmental protection standards established by the Act. 
    And second, that the state has the administrative and the technological capability to enforce those standards.

    Mr. Buscemi, supposing that that statute at the phase you now describe didn't talk about coal at all, it simply talked about the desirability of zoning on a national level, and Congress passed a law saying that for any state that doesn't zone land and keep a certain amount of prime farm land in existence that is now in existence, we will supersede that state's regulatory power with our own zoning act.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, I'm not sure that I completely appreciate the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I'm not sure that I understand the factual underpinning that Congress would have for that sort of regulation. 
    My answer to that question and hypotheticals of that kind is essentially that if Congress finds, and has a rational basis for finding, that a particular situation that exists in the states is affecting interstate commerce. 
    And if Congress devises a method that's rationally related to the protection of the regulation of interstate commerce, the statute is constitutional. 
    I'm not sure what the justification would be for the statute that you've just suggested, but I think that the test would be the same as it is here.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that the Court's decision in National League of Cities v. Usery establishes that there is some impact of the federal system of government, our state system, the Tenth Amendment, or the federal system of government generally, however you want to characterize that decision, on the exercise of the commerce power.

    We don't take that position here.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Then, do you think that Congress after reciting the history of surface farm lands in Oklahoma being blown over into Kansas and other places, back in the '30s, could require under the Commerce Clause that all farmers plough their land with contour plowing as distinguished from straight line plowing?

    My question gives you a concrete, specific statute, though.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, I have to confess ignorance as to the situation in the Dust Bowl in the '30s, and as to the impact of contour plowing as opposed to some other kind of plowing--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="490.730" stopTime="503.442">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, assuming... add to it the congressional recital that scientific research and practice has demonstrated that contour plowing will preserve the soil for future generations.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="503.442" stopTime="544.005">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    --I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, that if Congress rationally found that the failure to adopt a particular method of plowing or a particular method of cultivating farmlands had an adverse effect on interstate commerce and if Congress further rationally concluded that regulation of the method of plowing would help to alleviate that effect, that Congress could regulate that sort of agricultural activity, just as Congress has in fact regulated agricultural cultivation, for example, with the pricing regulations and also with the farm subsidy laws.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="544.005" stopTime="563.950">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, but they've done that by use of the power of the purse, granting subsidies if farmers complied with certain regulations. 
    I'm talking about a flat requirement that all farmers on certain findings engage in contour plowing. 
    Do you think they might be able to do it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="563.950" stopTime="601.403">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the findings are critical. 
    That is not the sort of thing that can be so lightly assumed in the hypothetical, because Congress here, in the Surface Mining Act, as it has in the other Commerce Clause legislation that the Court has sustained, has very carefully examined exactly the situation that did prevail and has determined that particular adverse effect on interstate commerce did exist. 
    And I think that if you are willing to assume that Congress has made all the necessary findings and Congress has determined that there is a rational relationship between--

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    --That's essentially what I'm trying to say, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I think that once you make that assumption you are presupposing the answer. 
    The question really is, what is the basis for the congressional action, and that's something that, you know, we can only talk about in connection--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="619.146" stopTime="629.830">

    The basis would be that the United States Department of Agriculture says it knows more about farming and soil conservation than the states do, and Congress accepts that.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi

    We have a very careful, detailed, lengthy investigation by Congress into surface mining and its adverse effects on commerce, and we have the legislative history that we've set out in the Appendix of our brief in this case which demonstrates, I think, that Congress has taken a very close look at surface mining and its effects on interstate commerce, and I don't--

    --I think, for example, that if you look at the child labor legislation that this Court upheld under the Commerce Clause in Darby, there's no question that Congress can try to pursue other ends in the exercise of its Commerce Clause power. 
    I want to make the point that as far as I can understand their argument, plaintiffs don't disagree with any of what we've been saying so far. 
    Their point is that the Surface Mining Act affects land use and land use is something that is committed exclusively by the Constitution to the states, and that that's why this statute exceeds the Commerce Clause. 
    And they cite this Court to the decision in McCready v. Virginia in 1877, and they talk about the separation of production and commerce. 
    But, as the Court held in Darby and in Jones &amp; Laughlin which Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to, and in Wickard v. Filburn, and Brightwood Dairy and a host of other cases, that the rigid separation of production and commerce is no longer the rule that's followed by this Court.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that, for example, in your dissent in this Court in Fry v. United States, you make the point that there is a very broad discretion in Congress to make findings, and that's part of what Congress is entitled to do, and you made that point, I believe, in the connection of United States v. California, which you specifically said you thought was a correct decision because Congress had made certain findings about the impact of railroad hazards on public safety and on commerce. 
    It is true that Congress does have an extremely broad factfinding capability and discretion, but I don't... that does not mean that there is no review whatsoever. 
    There must be a rational basis for a factual finding that Congress has made, and I think that the legislative record in this case, which includes volumes and volumes of hearings and evidence of the negative effects that surface mining has had, demonstrates that there is a basis for the congressional findings. 
    Now, there are, by the way, a number of federal statutes that affect land use. 
    I don't think there can be any question about that, and I'm not sure exactly what the district court and what appellees mean when they say that Congress is not free to effect land use, because, for example, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the historical preservation statutes in the Federal Code that we discussed in the Grand Central Station brief, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, a number of these statutes have effects on land use, and plaintiffs, I don't believe, contend that all of those statutes go beyond the Commerce Clause. 
    There's nothing about the phrase "land use" that's sacrosanct under the Constitution. 
    I mean, the Constitution does not say that states are the only governmental entities entitled to regulate land use.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think I've given my best answer to that question. 
    I think that Congress has found that it affects interstate commerce in several ways and I think that those findings are rational findings and they're supported by the evidence in the legislative record, in the committee reports, in the hearings, and so on. 
    I think, Mr. Chief Justice, even the record in the district court in this case provides several examples of... the district court's own opinion says that in the absence of this legislation, or if this legislation is invalidated, there will be negative consequences, not only for coal mining itself, but also for the safety and the health of the people in mining communities.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    --the district court ruled in our favor. 
    That's not true in the Indiana case, but the district court here sustained the statute on the Commerce Clause ground. 
    Now, admittedly, this Commerce Clause-Tenth Amendment or Federal System argument emerges to some extent in... this Court in National League of Cities said that the statute there was unquestionably valid under the Commerce Clause, but that the Tenth Amendment or the state-federal relationship in our constitutional system imposed some limitations on Congress's power to exercise the Commerce Clause delegated power. 
    So that that was... even in National League of Cities there was no question that the Commerce Clause power alone was sufficient to justify the congressional action. 
    The question is whether there was some additional limit. 
    And that brings me to the first point on which the district court ruled against the Secretary, and that is on this Tenth Amendment argument. 
    But this statute is far different from the one that the Court considered in National League of Cities, and the reaffirmation of the decision in United States v. California, in National League of Cities, I think is very instructive because there, in California, we had a federal statute that was being applied directly to the states. 
    This statute does not apply directly to the states in any way. 
    This statute applies only to coal mine operators. 
    The Federal Government does not require the states to undertake any measures whatsoever. 
    If the states do not wish to participate in the regulatory program that the federal statute establishes, they need not do so. 
    If they wish to do so, they can submit a proposed program to the Secretary and... by the way, there is a substantial amount of discretion left to the states in those proposed programs. 
    In fact, in Section 101(f) of the Act Congress itself stated that because of the diversity in terrain and climate, chemical and other physical conditions, the primary governmental responsibility should rest with the states. 
    That was Congress' whole plan under this statute. 
    And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in reviewing a request for preliminary injunction in the rule, the regulation review proceeding that's going on there right now, denied the preliminary injunction and in an opinion by the court... the panel included Judge Tamm, Judge McKinnon, and District Judge Greene... announced that this statute was truly an exemplary piece of federalist legislation because of the interaction between the state and the federal governments. 
    And I think that Congress has tried to strike the balance in a fair way here between the state and the federal government without requiring the states to do anything. 
    The states may... there is a substantial amount of leeway in framing these proposed permanent programs, and several of those proposed programs have already been approved, including one by the State of West Virginia.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In this case we are really talking about the idea of a state. 
    This is not a question of whether something is too local to be reached by the Congress through the exercise of its authority under the Commerce Clause. 
    That is settled. 
    It's not even a case that involves whether the Congress can do things that affect state functions, because that is also settled. 
    Environmental laws have some impact on that. 
    Here we're talking, on the other hand, about a wholesale displacement of integral state functions, because the Act in question results in the abridgment of state power to shape its communities and to shape its future.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    --it still collides with the idea of federalism, which is the essence of American democracy. 
    The idea that the people speak not just through the Congress but that they speak through the Constitution, which means that there is a role that exists, that's real, that's tangible, that's reserved to the states and cannot be abridged. 
    The flaw in this case is not that it touches land use, because this Court has held that Congress can provide who must be served in restaurants, how much can be grown on property, who it can be sold to. 
    But this decision of the Congress erodes the whole power of self-determination because it prohibits to a community from saying what goes where. 
    No one will contest but that the state is free to say where its capital will be located, where its county seat is to be located, and until this hour, it has not been seriously contested that the question of community planning to determine the layout of the community, its shape, its face, its map, is integral to the authority and the integrity of a system of state responsibilities in a constitutional framework.

    --Arguendo, and I think that... I understood the Chief Justice to talk about whether or not this power had been given rise to by the states, or exercised by the states themselves. 
    And It probably wasn't in as thoroughgoing a manner as it is now, but I think there was always the idea of community planning. 
    After all, Justice Chase told us in these two 1869 cases that a state is really defined as territory, people, and government, and that the overriding idea is the idea of a community. 
    And what we're arguing here is not some doctrinaire view of localism but the idea of self-determination, that this is really a promoter of democracy.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    Well, that's one of the happy by-products of the Tenth Amendment and the entire structure that one state, as Justice Brandeis says, is free to experiment and not put the whole nation in peril, that legislation that is novel can be tried in one state. 
    If it works well there it can be adopted other places, but it doesn't run the risk of making a national, a mistake that's hard to rectify and doesn't take into account the differences from locality to locality. 
    I think that this Act of Congress is a quantum leap into the vitals of the Tenth Amendment. 
    Because it does preempt essential attributes of state sovereignty and the scheme is exceedingly intrusive. 
    We're not talking here about extractive techniques, we're not talking about how you transport coal once it has been mined, we're not talking about pollution control. 
    We're talking about the shape of a community. 
    And I think in answer to the question put to counsel before I arose, Chief Justice Marshall has told us that this Court is not bound by Congressional findings, if those findings in fact are a pretext for taking on authority that it doesn't have. 
    The character of a community really is founded in land. 
    Now, I don't contest that indirectly Congress can reach local uses, that it can in some ways affect the private use of land. 
    But here it is taking away from a community the control over its own map. 
    The Congress can pass clearly and constitutionally a whole range of regulations to affect all manner of subjects, but not to displace as it does here reserved powers to the state. 
    This is really, if I might say, and I hope it will be, a Usery II, because--

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    --Well, I think it does too; and I've been before the Court on previous occasions to urge that much of our criminal law is being usurped by the writ of the habeas corpus, but you've told me about that and I won't raise it again. 
    But I think it's a serious question. 
    I just believe that it is appropriate to urge before the Court today that the Congress can't zone the whole character of a community. 
    Now, it's clear that while there are other significant issues in this case, the diminution of value to the property as the result of the original approximate contour requirement is a serious question of constitutional dimensions, because investment backed expectations have been from time out of mind that decisions about land use, certainly in the 20th century, if they're made by anybody except the people themselves, will be made by the state and not by the Federal Government.

 The Virginia steep slope provision, unlike the Indiana case, where there's a farmland, has a variance authorization for the Secretary of the Interior. 
 If in fact the statute were administered in a way that frequently resulted in variances in this part of the country where steep slopes are so common, would it still have the same impact, or are we perhaps getting to this question before we have to, until we know how often the?

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    Well, I think... I can say this about it, that it has no benefit to Virginia, first of all, factually, because the high wall must still be filled back in; there still must be backfilling. 
    So a variance is of no benefit to us at all. 
    We still have to comply with the law of gravity which really overrules the law in this case, because we can't fill it back and make it stay. 
    These slopes are so extremely steep that when you put the fill material back in at an angle like this, the sedimentation just... it won't hold; it won't bind to the rock, and it will drift away, and it makes it impossible, as the district court has found, to do that. 
    But the question of if it were administered in a manner not to intrude upon the Tenth Amendment and the authority of the states to be masters of their own destiny, it would be an open question. 
    I would think it would still be so intrusive to say to Virginia, you could only have coal mined and the land taken care of at all if you do it according to the federal law.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right. 
    The original approximate contour permits of a variation, on the face of the statute, but another provision requires that the high wall must still be backfilled in. 
    And so, as the court has said on page 36-A of the Appendix, 
    "For all practical purposes the backfilling stipulation destroys the usefulness of the variance, since the high wall must still be covered. "

    Contour mining is involved in these counties in the following manner. 
    Someone goes into the side of a mountain where you have these veins of coal that are maybe two to three feet in depth and they outcrop all the way up the mountain. 
    They go in and cut their initial cut, which leaves a bench and a high wall.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    --It's like a cliff. 
    They'll just dig straight into it till they come to a 90-degree angle. 
    The overburden is then required, under the Act, to be put back down in a valley and you go all the way around the mountain. 
    The way it works in southwest Virginia, you contour right around the side of the mountain. 
    We don't really have, as the court has found, any of this top of the mountain mining. 
    It's not practical down there. 
    Then, after you get started, under the Act, you take the overburden which is at the bottom of the valley and put it back up on your bench, and then you backfill all the way around, and the high wall under the Act has to be covered up completely, even though the Act says there is a variance under the original approximate contour, if you have to fill the back wall up.

    Mr. J. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, as I have said before, the people, territory, and government add up to a state, and the primary concept is a community. 
    There are certain functions that have been recognized by this Court to be essential to the separate and independent existence of a state. 
    Nothing permits the direct abridgment of certain powers. 
    The Act in question displaces the state's freedom to structure its integral operations of traditional government functions, and this law clearly does not comport with a federal system which is the essence of our system of democracy. 
    Chief Justice Chase's words are perhaps best on this point when he said that our republic is founded in a Constitution which in all of its provisions looks to an indestructible union composed of indestructible states. 
    The questions raised in this case are serious and of constitutional moment because if those communities in the State of Virginia cannot determine what the face and shape and map of those communities are going to be, then we have no limits to the commerce power anywhere in the Constitution, and to cabin and to curb it someday in the future will be even more difficult. 
    This is the best case that the Court now has before it to make plain what has been thought for a long time, that there are limits to the commerce power, that those limits are contained in the Constitution itself, and that when the commerce power is exercised in a way to undo the right of a state or locality to be master of its destiny, they are not constitutional. 
    The question of taking has been amply brought out in the brief. 
    The Court has found, and in this case the Court I know will give due deference to the findings of the court in this case which finds that the land is of no benefit to the landowners except that it can be surface-mined. 
    It is so steep and of so little value that this Act in effect constitutes a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to say just a couple of things in connection with this Tenth Amendment Commerce Clause argument. 
    First of all, this is not a zoning statute in the way that expression is ordinarily used. 
    This is not an attempt by the Federal Government to change the communities' maps in the State of Virginia.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, that is in the next case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I will say that, again, there is nothing in the prime farmland regulations that attempts to tell a local community how to use its land or what areas are to be used for residential purposes or commercial purpose or anything. 
    All of this goes only to surface mining. 
    And moreover it's not a prohibition on surface mining. 
    It's just a statutory provision that says that if you're going to surface mine, you've got to do it in this way, and you've got to restore the land so you don't cause damage.
