Minnick v. California Department of Corrections

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Minnick v. California Department of Corrections. 
    Mr. Yank, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="ronald_yank" startTime="14.355" stopTime="298.163">
    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Thirty years ago was the last time this Court had the opportunity in a constitutional contest to consider the issue of reverse discrimination in employment. 
    At that time this Court and the California Supreme Court agreed that a group could not force upon an employer the premise that that employer had to have a particular racial composition of that employer's work force which would match the service population. 
    Then too the Court was looking at a case from California. 
    The case was Hughes v. Superior Court of California, 339 U.S. 460. 
    And at that time the employer was Lucky Stores, and it was an attempt to have Lucky's have its store in Richmond, California, have its work force mirror the racial composition of the people who shop there, in Richmond, California. 
    And this Court, and the California Supreme Court, sustained a permanent injunction declaring at that time that such a goal of requiring such mirroring was an unlawful purpose as articulated under California law. 
    Why, then, 30 years later are we back? 
    The reason that we are back obviously has to do with the intervening events of the past decades, intervening struggles that counsel on both sides of the case here agree with, and support. 
    What has come out of the struggles of the intervening years, of these intervening decades, has been a strategy of how to indeed achieve the results we all want to see, which is to see people judged without regard to their race or color but simply with regard to their abilities. 
    Before you is a strategy of how to get there which petitioners feel in fact is a step away from the society, from the goals that we all want to see. 
    What we have before you is the result of a strategy of social engineering wherein the California Department of Corrections has attempted to have its work force mirror racially the inmate population or service population of the Department. 
    Justice Skelly Wright in a recent Law Review article in the University of Chicago Law Review has challenged those of us who oppose reverse discrimination saying that we talk in only abstract principles, but we don't get down to talking about social realities and, indeed, the facts. 
    I want to take on that challenge and speak of the facts of this case. 
    The case before you is not about remedying prior discrimination. 
    That is not this case. 
    In 1974 when the Department adopted its affirmative action program and then started to carry it out as we had described, in fact, black persons were over-represented in the work force of the Department of Corrections, as were orientals and as were people who would be called "others". 
    This was not a lily-white work force. 
    This was indeed an integrated work force. 
    There has never been the slightest hint in the record that there was not already sufficient minorities and women throughout the Department to handle any sorts of peculiar or specialized assignments that the Department somehow requires. 
    The program here was carried out not by low-level people who somehow misunderstood the goals and objectives of the Department. 
    It was carried out at the direction, and indeed the energetic behest of top management. 
    Top management said that the goals would be met "or else". 
    It's the Director of the Department talking. 
    The Director stated that if goals were not met, 
    "their own positions might be on the line. " 
    On this record any distinction between supposed goals and quotas is an illusory distinction.

    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    No, because in fact this action was brought on behalf, as a class action, of all people similarly situated by both Minnick, Darden, and by the Association. 
    And indeed, the evidence was voluminous that the policies being implemented went also to the question of hiring. 
    For example, people who applied for jobs had their races secretly coded on their application forms at the behest of the Department. 
    People who were not minorities or in the favored group literally were not considered for certain positions.

    "Proof was presented by respondents Minnick and Darden in support of the inference that each had been denied promotion in deference to a female or minority candidate, and it was shown that each had pursued a grievance to the State Personnel Board without success. "

 Well, now, as to Minnick and Darden, I note in the Court of Appeals opinion... this is at page A6... this statement: 
 "Proof was presented by respondents Minnick and Darden in support of the inference that each had been denied promotion in deference to a female or minority candidate, and it was shown that each had pursued a grievance to the State Personnel Board without success. " 
 And this next sentence: 
 "It was also established, however, that neither had been eligible for promotion under conventional civil service rules which applied irrespective of the AAP. " 
 --this program... "or its implementation". 
 If that's true, at least as to Minnick and Darden, what standing have they here.

    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    They were not reachable within the rule-of-three at the time. 
    However, moving on to what I gather to be the thrust of your question, the program that was described here was one that was going on statewide and was going on and will continue to go on in the future. 
    Minnick and Darden will be seeking other promotions, as will Caucasians and males throughout the rest of the Department. 
    This case was brought, not dealing with just those two promotions, but there was evidence dealing with promotions on a statewide basis at all kinds of levels, and not only-- 
    And the findings of fact in the trial court specifically state that Minnick and Darden as to future promotions will be disadvantaged, and that Caucasians and males in general throughout the Department will be disadvantaged with regard to future promotions. 
    Furthermore, the organization, CCOA itself, clearly has standing to bring this action on behalf of any of its members threatened with future or prospective injury as the result of the actions of the Department. 
    This suit, really, Your Honor, was one seeking prospective injunctive relief. 
    We never sought to void a past appointment of any person, figuring that they in one way were innocent victims of the Department's policies as well as Caucasians. 
    We were seeking prospective injunctive relief. 
    Minnick, Darden, and the Association clearly had that standing. 
    We also had, I think, five plaintiffs--

    The specific findings of fact to the trial court, which had plenty of substantial evidence to support them, should have been binding upon the Court of Appeal and any appellate court. 
    And it's those findings, I think, to which we must look.

speaker="ronald_yank" startTime="597.775" stopTime="662.718">
    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    Why, I am suggesting that this Court in the past has imbued, articulated precisely that rule. 
    In Ward v. Sullivan for example, this Court stated that an employee organization or an association may bring an action if it can show that any one of its members suffered damage, or any one of its members himself or herself would have standing before the Court to bring the action. 
    If there's anything that's clear from this record it's that this is indeed a case in controversy. 
    We could have had correctional officers taking numbers and standing up in line outside the courtroom, to come in and testify. 
    We had five people who testified who said that they were willing to have the complaint be amended to name them specifically as plaintiffs. 
    I do believe that CCOA alone, had it brought the case, would meet the standards of case or controversy as articulated by this Court in Ward v. Sullivan and also Ali v. Medrano.

    --Well, that says, if the case is to be retried. 
    Again the matter... literally, the cases that we have cited to the Court, plus the California cases, the Professional Firefighters and IAFF, were never brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal. 
    That is dicta, it wasn't briefed at all, and of course it is for this Court on the facts and the findings of fact as presented by the trial court, to determine whether indeed Caucasians and males were being threatened by the action of the department, whether they had suffered in the past.

    It was amended once in '75 and then again in '79, and indeed has been lodged by the court. 
    There is no indication whatsoever that the strategy and tactics, if you will, of the Department has changed. 
    And indeed, the Department, subsequent, for example, to the preliminary injunction in the case, went out and violated the order of the court. 
    And, of course, as you know, there was literally a hearing as to whether the Department and its top officials should be held in contempt.

    No, because the trial occurred prior thereto. 
    I would agree that this Court has before it a particular set of actions by a department. 
    The situation might be a little bit like Washington v. Davis, where this Court, even though it knew that other tests were being considered by the District of Columbia, refused to remand even though the District of Columbia and the Civil Service Commission who won the case were urging a remand back to the trial court for a review of how the test and its procedures were working. 
    This Court said it had before it a test and certain facts and it was going to decide that case.

    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    --Not a bit. 
    And indeed, they reaffirm, they reaffirm explicitly that even though LEAA changed its regs. 
    so as to not set as goals the "service population", nonetheless the California Department of Corrections reaffirmed that it was having as its goals the inmate population. 
    So, if anything, it's more emphatic as to what the social engineering goals of this plan are as we stand and sit here today. 
    In the record in this case, obviously the Court is familiar with the explicit set-aside, and the fact that out of the mouths of the Department's only witnesses, the Department acknowledged that it was hiring, was promoting lesser qualified people. 
    That is to say, if people were somehow within a reasonable range of qualifications, no matter whether the Caucasian was more qualified, the minority would get the job. 
    I suggest that that situation is similar to the one described by Justice Powell in the decision in Arlington Heights. 
    Justice Powell did not use the term, "but for causation", although we have used it in our brief. 
    But in Arlington Heights, Justice Powell and the opinion of the Court made it clear that if without the tainted or improper motivation the decision would have been different, then the act of the public entity should be illegal. 
    As a matter of fact, there the Court said that if the plaintiff could show any improper aspects of the decision-making process... here it would be consideration of race... the burden shifted to the defendants. 
    The burden shifted to the defendants to prove that without the improper motive the decision would have been the same. 
    Here by testimony of the Department's own top management, the Department acknowledges that the improper motive, the consideration of race, is the changing factor, the "but-for" factor that puts a woman or a minority ahead of the Caucasian or the male.

    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    Actually, I think I'm incorrect on that. 
    I believe that, indeed, this Court in examining federal statutes has mandated that state courts indeed provide a cause of action under federal statutes, and indeed, in a brief of the Solicitor General, the Michigan Law Review... I think it's '75, not '76, Michigan Law Review, indeed sets forth those cases. 
    So I would say that indeed this Court could reverse a dismissal of a state court saying there was no standing, if this Court found that the federal standards had been met. 
    And of course we were dealing with, as we are here, a constitutional claim. 
    Given the facts of the set-asides and, really, the "but-for" causation involving use of race leading to promotions and hiring, what one also sees in this record is that it is possible the benefit here is a multi-edged sword, that it is not operating necessarily to the benefit of the classes that supposedly are to benefit. 
    There's evidence in this record that not every correctional officer or minority correctional officer wishes to consider himself or herself a specialist in dealing with members of his own race. 
    There's evidence of this record that one minority group and a member thereof, a high-ranking management person, was using his power and influence to cut back on the promotions of another minority group, feeling that his minority group wasn't getting enough of the promotions in question.

    --What we are looking at here is a question of whether a government, be it a state or a city or county can tell its citizens, even though... sir, madam... you were the most qualified person for the job, you didn't get it because of your race or sex. 
    And to do that in the face of our Constitution requires strong, strong compulsion indeed, and all of this Court's cases and other courts' cases about prior discrimination and remedying same are inapplicable because this plan, in its text, in '74, '75, it never mentioned such a thing. 
    It never mentioned, for that matter, the so-called "operational necessity of defense". 
    What has happened is that the defendants have scurried around making arguments for the very first time at appellate levels, including for the very first time in this Court, that their action is somehow justified or valid. 
    They cite, for example, recently, in materials that were lodged with the Court, supposed legislative statutes or findings that somehow required this action. 
    And yet, if you read those legislative materials and committee hearings rather closely, you will see no mention or requirement that the states or their agencies were to somehow be granting preferential treatment to anybody. 
    Those materials talked of equality and equal employment opportunity, not preferential treatment.

    --It is a factual question, and here's why. 
    That is, Court of Appeal had before it the operational necessity defense facts brought forward. 
    It said, that's enough, right there. 
    Not, incidentally, just under the Fourteenth Amendment, but under Title VII. 
    They said, Weber is dispositive and that's it.

    Yes, the court could have rejected that stipulation and, for example, asked us to go through the motions of amending the complaint naming the other five persons who were reachable and were willing to become a plaintiff. 
    We could have done that rather socially wasteful, I think, activity. 
    The trial court sat there and heard all the witnesses and had heard people say they were willing to be plaintiff, and indeed, frankly, the trial court had admonished counsel to try and compact the case because, as you know, the evidence that we did bring in was rather lengthy and voluminous.

   Argument of Stuart R. Pollak
speaker="stuart_r_pollak" startTime="1766.289" stopTime="1967.505">
    Mr. Stuart R. Pollak 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case was tried in the Superior Court in San Francisco before this Court had rendered its decision in Bakke; indeed, before this Court had rendered its decision in the United Jewish Organization v. Carey case. 
    The sole issue on which the parties focused when this case was tried in Superior Court was a question open at the time as to whether or not it was permissible for the Department of Corrections under any circumstances to give any consideration to the question of race or sex in hiring and promotional practice. 
    The petitioners before the Superior Court argued that it was not, that absolutely no consideration could be given under any circumstances, that race and sex were absolutely impermissible considerations, and the Superior Court accepted that view. 
    That it did so is clear from the record but it is made very simply clear by looking at the notice of intended decision of the Superior Court, which is in Appendix D to the petition, the Court framed the issues. 
    The Department at that time defended its policy on the ground that race and sex were not the only factors, and then quoting, said, 
    "Plaintiffs on the other hand assert that the hiring or promotion of a person based in whole or in part on sex or racial background or ancestry is unconstitutional and void. " 
    "The Court agrees with plaintiffs. " 
    And the court went on, then, to enter an injunction, which is Appendix G to the petition, which prohibited the Department from giving any preference, advantage, or benefit based on race, color, sex, or national origin in hiring or promotion. 
    And it is that judgment in that injunction which the petitioners are asking this Court to reinstate. 
    That is their request, if you look at the conclusion of both the briefs they filed in this Court. 
    The Court of Appeal in California, of course, reversed that decision. 
    It held that race or sex may be considered if necessary to serve a compelling state interest which the Court of Appeal held the orderly administration of prisons to be. 
    The Court of Appeal's reversal of that decision had the effect of remanding the case to the Superior Court for a new trial necessarily, I believe, raising the question asked by Justice White a few moments ago, whether or not we even have a final decision here in this case. 
    And I submit that most clearly the Court does not have a final decision here and there is no jurisdiction to go on and to consider this case. 
    While the Court of Appeal quite properly, I submit, applied this Court's decisions in Bakke and Weber and now Fullilove to reverse a Superior Court decision--

    Mr. Stuart R. Pollak 
    We're not suggesting that we don't have that ultimately here, if the case is a final judgment and properly before the Court. 
    And the point that I'd like to stress at the outset is that although the Court of Appeal properly held that the Superior Court was wrong in saying you can never consider race or sex, the decision is not a final decision, a final judgment within the meaning of Section 1257, because there remain on remand many issues to be considered which go to the heart of the petitioners' federal claims which he has asserted, which they were asserting in this Court. 
    And until those questions to which I'll come in a moment... until those questions are resolved, neither this Court nor anyone else will know whether the state courts will or will not grant Petitioners the relief they seek on their federal grounds. 
    And I think that is the important point which I'd like to stress insofar as the law is concerned. 
    It is true, of course, that this Court in recent years has expanded somewhat on earlier definitions of what constitutes a final judgment. 
    There are, for example, decisions of this Court indicating that a decision may be final where a federal issue has been conclusively resolved in the state court, but further proceedings remain to be had on other issues. 
    But no case... and I stress that neither our research nor the research of the several amicus briefs which address this point, nor indeed petitioners themselves, found any case where you have a final decision in a situation where further state court proceedings remained on the very federal issues that are involved, and which the petitioners are seeking to have reviewed in this Court.

    I believe the effect of the reversal by the Court of Appeal is to remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial on all issues. 
    The only thing that is determined by the ruling of the Court of Appeal is a strict question of law, leaving open for consideration questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law.

    Mr. Stuart R. Pollak 
    The question of law, Justice Rehnquist, that I say was resolved, is that the correctional objectives of the Department of Corrections constitute a compelling state interest in that a compelling state interest can justify constitutionally and under Title VII employment practices which are race-conscious, if they are properly limited to accomplish that objective. 
    What has not been decided, and what remains to be further explored on remand, is (a) the facts with respect to the program the Department is carrying out and implementing, and secondly the mixed question of fact and law as to whether or not the Department's program is sufficiently limited to accomplish only the compelling state interest which they are designed to serve, on the other hand.

speaker="stuart_r_pollak" startTime="2364.129" stopTime="2431.852">
    Mr. Stuart R. Pollak 
    I believe that the Court of Appeal decided that question on the basis of the record before it, but I also believe that by remand the Court of Appeal has furnished the parties with the opportunity to submit additional evidence to expand upon those issues. 
    The Court of Appeal has not determined... if I could bring this into the concrete with respect to specific challenges to the Department's program that the petitioners are making-- 
    The focal point of the petitioners' attack on our claim is their contention that the Department is setting aside positions for minority members excluding nonminorities from any consideration for promotion. 
    Now, on the basis of the record before it, the Court of Appeal has held that the Department is not doing that, that all the Department is doing in connection with promotions is taking race into account as one consideration which under appropriate circumstances can act as a plus factor in an individual's favor.

    Mr. Stuart R. Pollak 
    --Your Honor, I suppose it is correct that the Court of Appeal said that the Superior Court would have been justified if it had excluded that evidence on that ground, which it did not do. 
    That wasn't the Superior Court's reason. 
    But I think the important point is that the Court of Appeal did explicitly say that all of that evidence with respect to prior discrimination can be considered when the case is remanded to the Superior Court. 
    So that even if the Superior Court was correct initially in excluding the evidence the fact of the matter is that when this case goes back to the Superior Court that evidence will be admissible and will be considered. 
    And I think that is the important point with respect to this limited aspect of the finality question.

    Finding 19 says that that is a permissible form of discrimination because of the State's interest in the management of the correctional officer system. 
    And they have held as a matter of law, as I understand it, that Finding 19 is a complete defense.

    --No, Your Honor, only with respect to that limited question has there been a determination that is conclusive by the Court of Appeal. 
    The question that remains for further consideration under the Court of Appeal's opinion is whether or not the Department's plan is sufficiently tailored to accomplish that objective in a permissible manner. 
    And on remand, it will be free to the petitioners to offer evidence and to squarely address this issue which, I repeat, has never been addressed in the state courts, of whether or not the goals go beyond what is necessary to achieve the state interest in orderly prison administration.

    And they say, if all they prove is that it's a plus factor, then Finding 19 is an adequate defense.

    In other words, they're saying, as I read it, on this record that which the plaintiff proved has been adequately defended and the plaintiff stands here in court today and tells us he doesn't want to prove any more.

    --I am trying to prevent the defendant from arguing to this Court, and inducing this Court to consider the question of whether the program is excessive in a respect as to which no evidence has been introduced. 
    If the petitioners were willing to withdraw from this Court's consideration the question of whether or not this program is sufficiently tailored to accomplish its objectives, that would be fine. 
    And that issue, I submit is inextricably part of the federal constitutional question which this Court has to consider. 
    And the petitioners are urging this Court that the program is excessive in a particular which has never been considered in the state courts and as to which none of the parties, including the Department, had any opportunity to present evidence.

    All correct, Your Honor. 
    And as I say, our stipulation certainly was never that such facts exist. 
    We simply stipulated to standing, period. 
    I submit, Your Honor, in closing, that the issues which are involved in this case, those that have been decided and those that remain to be decided, are inextricably interwoven. 
    You can't pick just one issue and review it. 
    You have claims here that are asserted by the petitioners, federal claims, as to which additional evidence will be appropriate in the state courts. 
    And given that fact, you do not have a conclusive determination as to whether the state courts will or will not give petitioners relief on their federal claims.

    Mr. Ronald Yank 
    Okay. 
    We do not... we are opposed to any kind of remand here. 
    We believe that one way or another the federal issue is squarely before the Court on these facts. 
    Counsel seems to be suggesting, as they have throughout at the appellate level, let them make out a case for past discrimination. 
    That isn't this plan. 
    That's never the justification. 
    The goals aren't geared toward remedying past discrimination. 
    As in Washington v. Davis, you have a certain plan before you and a certain set of facts. 
    We believe that on the constitutional merits we're entitled to win. 
    If they want to draft a new plan, they can go back and do it, but we're entitled to win on this suit.
