Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Metromedia, Incorporated v. City of San Diego. 
    Mr. Abrams, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="floyd_abrams" startTime="10.341" stopTime="64.896">
    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is an appeal from a decision of the California Supreme Court upholding against constitutional challenge a San Diego ordinance the purpose and effect of which is to prohibit all off-premise outdoor advertising within the City of San Diego. 
    There has been some dispute between the parties in the briefs as to the precise scope of the statute and I would like to begin my argument with that. 
    The parties have stipulated that San Diego, now the eighth largest city in the nation and the second in California, is a sprawling 320-mile city filled with hundreds of miles of streets, with a significant industrial and commercial area, and as well, of course, with park areas, beach areas, residential and other areas.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Would it make any difference, Mr. Abrams, if this were a town of 10,000?
speaker="floyd_abrams" startTime="69.910" stopTime="131.494">
    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    It would make a difference only in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice, we do think that it is relevant that this is a case which arises entirely out of a ban which takes place in an industrial and commercial area, in part because we are met with the argument by our opponents that outdoor advertising is in its entirety commercial speech, which it is not. 
    But even if it were commercial speech, or even if it is, as it is, more commercial speech than other kinds of speech, then it's surely relevant that we deal here only with an industrial and commercial area. 
    In a smaller community which had an industrial and commercial area, we would be urging on you virtually the same arguments as today. 
    It is conceivable that in some other area, on some different facts, absent the stipulated record here today, that a balance could conceivably be struck in a different fashion than we are urging on you today. 
    It is conceivable that that could be the case in an area of 10,000 people rather than a large industrial city.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Would that mean that in an area that was mixed, that is, residences and stores and theaters and the usual mix, you'd have a different rule?
speaker="floyd_abrams" startTime="211.462" stopTime="319.138">
    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    We think the rule of law that we would urge on you today would be the same. 
    The only thing that would be different is that to the extent that there is any balance to be struck at all, I must acknowledge to you that it is at least conceivable on a different factual record that the balance could be struck in a different way than we would urge on you today. 
    If you do anything less than establish a per se rule that under no circumstances may outdoor advertising be banned... and we have not gone that far in our advocacy view... implicit in that is that there could be some circumstance, and that there would be some circumstance, in which it could be proper to ban outdoor advertising. 
    Now, there are factors we think that you should consider. 
    There are things to be weighed in making that decision, but one of them, we think, is that this arises in a commercial and industrial area of a large urban community. 
    I wish to emphasize that based on the stipulated facts we deal here with a case where San Diego has 2.8 percent of the city which is zoned commercial and industrial. 
    All outdoor advertising as the parties have defined it, as legislation generally defines it, is in that area. 
    And by outdoor advertising we mean outdoor advertising as distinguished from so-called on-site advertising. 
    On-site advertising is basically advertising about the building, the place itself in which an event, a business, occurs. 
    The service is sold there, the products made there. 
    Outdoor advertising, as the parties have stipulated, is a different thing. 
    It is, as the parties have said, a medium of communication. 
    It is in fact a medium which is distinct and unique in a variety of ways.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    It would in the main be the same, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    The only difference that I can conceive of is this. 
    To the extent that a time, place, and manner test were applied... as we would urge on you that it is not the correct test, but if that were applied... alternative channels of communication is one of the aspects of that test. 
    Again, it is conceivable, although I think highly unlikely and it's really not the case in San Diego, that a community which has never ever had any kind of outdoor advertising could in theory have built up such alternatives of such a discreet and unique nature to compensate for the absence of it that maybe in some city or community they have found their way around it. 
    I don't think that's likely and it is our argument to you that the issue is basically the same, for example, in San Diego, whether no billboards had been built or whether there are a number of billboards available now. 
    Now, the reason that we feel freer to say that in San Diego is that we do have a stipulation of the parties which says, in as close to so many words as parties can, that there are no alternative means which do suffice. 
    So I am comfortable at least in the San Diego context of saying to you that whether or not there were a lot of billboards there or not, the result should be the same.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    --It's at page 125a and 126a of the jurisdictional statement. 
    It says: 
    "Valuable commercial, political, and social information is communicated to the public through the use of outdoor advertising. " 
    "Many businesses and politicians and other persons rely upon outdoor advertising because other forms of advertising are insufficient, inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive. " 
    We think that goes about as far as parties could, or indeed, a court could, to establish the fact that alternative channels of communication are insufficient to serve the many people who find outdoor advertising indispensable in San Diego. 
    And the language of the stipulation, we think, is clear enough on its face.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    Well, if I can go back to the Linmark case, for example, which Your Honor wrote a few years ago, in the context of dealing with signs on lawns, the Court indicated that it was by no means clear that other means of communication would serve, even though that was a situation in which ads could be put in the newspaper and that there were other ways to communicate. 
    We don't deny... how could we? 
    that there are other ways to communicate. 
    What we do urge on you is that in the context where you have a distinct, unique kind of communication, that at least the law ought to provide a First Amendment test... and we think we can meet any First Amendment test, but a First Amendment test... and not simply a property-oriented test before allowing its complete destruction.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    I hope not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    I don't believe that dirigibles carrying signs are a distinct medium of communication. 
    They're certainly not a recognized medium of communication in the same sense as Congress, say, itself in various legislation referring to outdoor advertising, meaning and saying that they mean commercial billboards as outdoor advertising. 
    It's not the same thing in terms of the commonplace use through centuries of outdoor advertising.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    No, I think that, you know, one is entitled... I would like to put it this way, that the response that I would give to the question of, how can you tell if something is a medium of communication, because I think that's what we're really addressing now, is well put by Mr. Justice Black in the Martin v. Struthers case when he dealt with door-to-door solicitation. 
    And he looked at the history of door-to-door solicitation, he looked at the commonplace nature of door-to-door solicitation, he looked at the fact that it was available and important to diverse groups of citizens. 
    Those things are true, we think, on the stipulated record of this case, and on the facts of this case, with respect to outdoor advertising. 
    I don't think it's true with respect to dirigibles flying over a community. 
    Beyond that--

 And what you're saying, I suppose, is that at a point in its growth there would come into being a constitutional right to put billboards up, if it grew gradually from a small residential community to a large city? 
 At some point in its historical development a constitutional right would emerge.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    I responded earlier to Justice Stewart by saying that we do not quarrel with the constitutionality, per se, at least, of zoning regulations which ban outdoor advertising in residential areas. 
    That does not mean, or I don't want to convey to you the proposition that there is never an area which is residential or of sufficient size or of a sufficient nature where outdoor advertising is not in fact a medium of communication of which the public can't be deprived. 
    I could imagine, for example, a different ruling from this Court as to sound trucks going through one kind of community and another. 
    It cannot be that sound trucks can be banned in their entirety from the width and breadth of San Diego. 
    It is conceivable that in a community small enough and sleepy enough and quiet enough that the Court might strike a different balance with respect to sound trucks in that area. 
    And I think the same is true, I urge upon you, it would be true with respect to leaflets. 
    It does make a difference where First Amendment rights are claimed. 
    And it seems to us that it makes a difference therefore, whether it is claimed in a residential or an urban area.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    It would depend, Mr. Justice Powell, it seems to me, on where it is. 
    Washington, for example, now does allow outdoor advertising in its commercial-manufacturing zone. 
    You will see some billboards out on New York Avenue, for example. 
    There are some billboards in certain other areas of town. 
    If the statute related to the area around this Courthouse, say, which is essentially federal land and which would, as I understand it, require a new federal law, in fact, to allow it, it would not be unconstitutional.

    Because it does depend on the separate facts of the situation. 
    Now, I must qualify my answers at least to this degree. 
    To the extent that factual issues are raised in a variety of questions asked here today, obviously, you would need a new factual record as to the nature of the community, the kind of people that live and work in the community, the size of the community, a variety of factors which we think at least ought to bear upon a decision.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    If I may, I'd like to do a time, place, and manner analysis for you. 
    Now, we have urged upon you in our brief that a time, place, and manner analysis is insufficiently protective in a situation in which an entire medium is being banned. 
    And I would like to start briefly with that because we do think it's important even though we think we can meet a time, place, and manner analysis. 
    To say this: if there were a ban in let's say a large community or a small community of all magazines or of all something else, the problem with a time, place, and manner analysis is that if the ban gets large enough, sweeping enough, not subject as we argue with respect to this statute of certain underinclusiveness, that it might be able to meet a time, place, and manner test. 
    If some community were to object to magazines on the basis of littering the streets and big trucks going down the streets delivering magazines, it could be said that that is a significant governmental interest. 
    It could be said that it is content-neutral, because they're banning all magazines. 
    And it could be said, given the theory of the California Supreme Court at least, contrary to our views, that there are adequate channels of alternative communication.

    Absolutely not.

    My answer was not at all premised on the fact that it is federal land. 
    I agree with everything your question said. 
    My answer was premised on my own observation absent, I must say, a factual record, but my own sense of the City of Washington. 
    There is an area in Washington which I know as a commercial-industrial area. 
    There are outdoor advertising displays in that area. 
    There is an area of Washington which is of a special, scenic, governmental, other-nature. 
    It has never been our contention in this case that it is a flat ban or that it is unconstitutional to keep outdoor advertising out of certain parts of cities and that that was the basis of my answer.

 It seems to me you've conceded that they could be banned in historic areas, conceded they could be banned in residential areas. 
 But if the city adds a manufacturing area, then is it the constitutional duty to allow billboards?

    --Yes; absolutely. 
    Now, the hardest case for me to argue to you, that a ban, a total ban is unconstitutional, is in the smallest, most Williamsburg-like area. 
    Now, again, I'm not saying that because there's an industrial area that's the only area in which you have to allow some billboards, and that that is not our position at all. 
    Like so many First Amendment cases, the facts and the factors differ. 
    Where things occur, what traditionally occurs in an area, whether or not there are factories, bears upon the decision in the case.

    Well, it would be content-related and it would have the vice of all content-related statutes. 
    We have urged indeed that the very statute before you is, because of various factors relating to it, content related. 
    But I should have added that in response to Justice White.

    But Williamsburg really is a good example, if I can sum up on that, that it's perfectly proper to say in the historic section of Williamsburg, you're not going to have billboards. 
    And one of the reasons that it's proper is that in fact you do have exposure to outdoor advertising outside that central district.

    Mr. Floyd Abrams 
    We would urge on you, as an example of how a statute can be drafted to meet constitutional demands, the California statute which is referred to at page 2 of our reply brief. 
    California has passed a statute, over 40 other states have passed statutes, which do have limitations on where billboards can be, which do have limitations on the relationship between a billboard and an intersection, for example. 
    That's not unconstitutional. 
    What's unconstitutional is a flat ban of the sort, of the nature, of the totality that San Diego has done.

   Argument of C. Alan Sumption
speaker="c_alan_sumption" startTime="2371.283" stopTime="2464.182">
    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to get straight at the outset a few factual statements that I think need some elucidation. 
    First of all, the City of San Diego's ordinance does not prohibit all off-premise signs. 
    I believe that was Mr. Abrams' statement. 
    What it does is prohibit certain types of off-site advertising that is commonly referred to as billboards. 
    The California Supreme Court specifically narrowed, gave a narrowing construction to the ordinance, applying it against the commercial type billboard, and indicated that it would not apply to small yard signs or things of this nature, of picket signs evidencing a labor dispute, things of this nature. 
    The stipulation No. 28 that Mr. Abrams refers to does not say that there are no alternative means of communication or advertising. 
    First of all, the language of the stipulation is ambiguous. 
    Secondly, subsequent to entering into that stipulation the ordinance was amended to add I believe it was either the 12th or 13th exception to the signs prohibited by excepting out temporary political campaign signs, a rather large area of signs.

speaker="c_alan_sumption" startTime="2467.883" stopTime="2570.185">
    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    It strengthens the case, Your Honor, because without it it would mean, it would ban political campaign signs. 
    And part of the reason that the stipulation was entered into was that, I think it's a commonly known fact that certain politicians do make use of off-site advertising to advertise their campaigns. 
    And the last point on the stipulation is that the California Supreme Court indicated that to the extent that a person may feel that he cannot convey his message without the use of an off-site billboard-type sign, that that person could come in and challenge the ordinance as applied to him. 
    But the court said that that was not sufficient to strike down the ordinance on its face. 
    Another statement was made, that the City of San Diego has agreed somehow that if you can't have commercial speech you can't have noncommercial or political and social speech. 
    That's an incorrect statement of the City position. 
    What we did is, by way of argument in our brief, that that is in fact the position of the billboard companies. 
    We just turned their own argument around against them in the context of saying that this demonstrates even further that what we're talking about is a commercial means of exploiting speech; that the income behind it is what enables the limited numbers of noncommercial speech to even exist. 
    We do not concede that.

    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    Well, there are several reasons, I think, behind that. 
    First of all, campaigns come and go. 
    They are temporary in nature. 
    The typical campaign type poster is not anywhere near as extensive as the permanent billboard-type structure that's there long after the message goes. 
    The courts have said--

    That's also my understanding of the way they operate their business. 
    Also, as I started to say, the courts have given political speech, campaign-type speech, placed it on the highest level.

    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    --Yes, Your Honor, and the California Supreme Court did grant a rehearing on the case, and it was argued a second time before the California Supreme Court. 
    At that time the California Supreme Court seemed mostly interested in an amendment to the Federal Highway Beautification Act as it related to a compensation question, and that's an issue that has been raised by the City of San Diego because it was decided against us by the California Supreme Court on a petition for writ of cert that's now pending before the Court, but not before it here today. 
    Another statement that has been made here today by counsel for Metromedia is that somehow the nature of a community and whether or not signs are in commercial versus noncommercial zones areas has a bearing, if not a crucial bearing, on whether or not billboards can be kept out of the city. 
    It seems to me that in essence the logical conclusion that's reached from that statement is that somehow the First Amendment is triggered by local zoning. 
    And of course zoning, the considerations behind local zoning, really, are done for reasons completely independent from First Amendment and perhaps other constitutional considerations. 
    For example, there are some cities, the largest one that comes to mind is Houston, that doesn't even have zoning. 
    But, what do you do in a city that doesn't have any zoning? 
    And along those lines I think in essence what one is--

    The other thing about allowing billboards in commercial zones but not in others is, it seems to me that the esthetic justification of the ordinance should apply equally in commercial areas because municipalities including San Diego are recognizing perhaps their past mistakes in allowing commercial areas to be eyesores and trying to improve those areas. 
    And I don't think we should be doomed to failure by saying, well, they're not that attractive now, we're bound to leave them that way.

    --First of all, Mr. Justice Marshall, what we're talking about is signs, more specifically off-site signs. 
    And more specifically yet, a specific type of off-site sign known as a billboard. 
    Now, off-site signs are allowed by this ordinance. 
    They are not totally prohibited. 
    The particular type of sign, the manner of use of a particular type of sign, a billboard, is prohibited. 
    It depends now on how you look at it. 
    We contend we're regulating off-site signs. 
    We allow some and we do not allow others. 
    And secondly, I don't think the compelling state interest test or whatever has any bearing on whether or not it's... or rather, that the time, place, and manner test has anything to do with whether or not there's a total prohibition.

    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    That's the kind of semantical problem, I think, that we get into when we start putting these in categories like "total prohibition", "total ban". 
    But time, place, and manner, as I understand the Court's decisions, is really a means of distinguishing from a regulation that's attempting to get at the content of speech, when we're talking about First Amendment rights. 
    And it's clear that we're not dealing with the primary effects of a particular message that's being advertised on a billboard. 
    As stated in the Linmark case, we're talking about the adverse secondary effects from the manner in which the messages are portrayed or put before the public. 
    And therefore it is a time, place, and manner regulation. 
    Furthermore, because of the blight that they have aesthetically, you know, we talk about more narrowly drawn measures, which Mr. Abrams has mentioned, saying that this is not narrowly drawn because this is a total ban; we get into subjective decisions on, for example, well, let's talk about the height, or the square footage of the sign. 
    If we were to put a regulation in either of those two respects or the distance between billboards, the next thing you have is, well, if we have 1,000 feet between billboards, why not 900 feet? 
    It could have been more narrowly drawn, and you go on and on and on. 
    I think that these things--

    Well, but the distinction between that category of case is that the problem can really be dealt with. 
    The problem is, in one instance, litter. 
    And you can easily pass an ordinance that makes it against the law to litter. 
    It's not the handing of the message, the leaflet, to somebody that should be banned, because people may want that message and somebody else may want to convey it. 
    But it's you know, the dropping of it on the ground and leaving it there that's the problem. 
    I don't think we have that type of situation with the billboard.

    I don't think it depends on the particular facts of a particular city. 
    I think the things are a blight on any community and I think the communities... and to the extent that traffic safety is involved, the same considerations. 
    They're put there on a highway intended with all the art and skill of the manufacturers to make people driving in automobiles look at them. 
    To the extent that that causes a momentary distraction, there's a potential for some sort of action.

    Mr. C. Alan Sumption 
    Well, there are certain things that obviously, you know, we just can't get rid of women. 
    We're stuck, fortunately or unfortunately, with women walking down the street. 
    It would seem to me, as I indicated, to a large extent the arguments set forth by the billboard companies are predicated, though, upon where they want to be, where it's advantageous to them to be to make money. 
    And to the extent that we keep them out of areas that they feel they need to be in for the economics of the system to present a showing, as set forth in the stipulated facts, that national advertisers buy a program of local exposure throughout a community. 
    Their argument that, what if a community has one small commercial area? 
    And they say they have a right to be in the commercial area. 
    They probably wouldn't want to be there, because one sign in one small commercial area isn't going to be monetarily feasible to them. 
    So I think, to a large degree those arguments are not predicated upon the effect of the First Amendment, but upon--

    This Court has never held that there's a constitutional right to a particular mode of expression or the most cost-efficient means of getting a message across, and to the extent that these signs are intrusive and in effect invade the very privacy of people that are unwilling to receive the messages, there's no ability to refuse the message, as there is in virtually every other means of communication. 
    And when billboard companies say this is a unique means of communication, I would have to agree with them in the sense that it is unique, because it's making use of public highways and forcing the message upon the public, taxpayers that pay for beautification of the highways and yet, you know, may not choose to have the messages forced on them.

    There has been... that's been a matter of controversy. 
    I believe that at the present time there are some advertisement panels that face in to the stadium but are not visible from the public rights-of-way outside the stadium, and I believe that those messages change to some degree, but I think for the most part they stay there either for quite a while or semi-permanently.

    That's correct. 
    If the Court has no other questions, I would just conclude by saying that I think that justifications have been set forth and that this case is not easily squeezed into mechanical principles of other First Amendment cases. 
    This is not a content-based ordinance, and the principles that are cited by counsel for billboard companies have been applied in a very different context, and I don't think that they're applicable or binding in this fact situation.
