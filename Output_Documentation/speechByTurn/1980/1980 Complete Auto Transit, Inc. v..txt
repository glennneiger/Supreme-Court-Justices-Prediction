    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue submitted to the Court in this case is limited to a determination whether individual employees who engage in a violation of a collective bargaining agreement and who acted without the authorization of their labor organization are responsible for damages sustained by their employer and liable to it arising out of their individualized breach of that collective bargaining agreement. 
    And I might note that it would appear that is the very issue reserved by this Court in its decision of Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining.

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    Yes, it is, Your Honor. 
    A brief recitation of the facts, I think, are important to a determination of this issue. 
    In June of 1967 the respondent employees engaged in a work stoppage against the three petitioners for up to and including two weeks in time. 
    Now, petitioners alleged and respondents admit that at no time did their labor organization, aid, abet, condone, or authorize this work stoppage, that this was indeed an individual action on their part.

    I'm equating it to the violation of the agreement that contained a no strike clause.

    Just as though there was no union entity involved?

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    Well, I can't involve a collective bargaining agreement without acknowledging the role of the union, but I do know that the no strike clause should be equally enforceable against the employees as well as the union.

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    Petitioner employers now attempt to hold these employees responsible for the damages directly resulting from their individualized breaches of the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to this lawsuit brought in accordance with Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    Now, although 301 on its face contemplates suits alleging violation of collective bargaining agreements, petitioner concedes that the language does not expressly address the issue of individual liability arising out of those violations. 
    A review of relevant congressional history, in the opinion of petitioners, indicates that Congress did not specifically authorize or prohibit such actions against individual employees, when their conduct was not authorized by their local unions.

    No, I don't believe that there was any specific discussion covering that subject matter in the Taft-Hartley. 
    The purpose of the Taft-Hartley, as I understand it, and in reading this Court's decisions, not attempting to tell you what you meant, but attempting to read as what I understand it to be, is that Section 301 was intended to permit the enforcement of labor agreements against labor organizations, as pointed out by Justice Brennan; to hold these agreements equally binding upon all parties to that collective bargaining agreement; to foster a collective bargaining process as the desired method of resolving industrial disputes in this country.

    There was, particularly in the Case bill and to some degree as it related to Section 301(b). 
    Now, there was indeed some congressional concern about that, but petitioners respectfully suggest that the facts confronting the Court in this issue are considerably different and not analogous to Danbury Hatters. 
    As I understand Danbury Hatters it was a decision which arose out of a consumer or secondary boycott by the Hatters' Union against Danbury Hatters. 
    It's my understanding that the members of the union who were ultimately held responsible for damages may or may not have known of the actions of their union. 
    It was a consumer boycott. 
    But by their association with the union the court held that they were responsible for the damages imposed by the union. 
    And this was the spectrum--

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    And therefore they had to go to the employees to seek the assets to fulfill for damage remedies. 
    Congress was concerned about that and sought in 301(b) specific language which said that a damage judgment against unions is not to be held... the individuals are not to be held responsible. 
    And we are not attempting by this decision to invade that, or this Court's prior decision in Atkinson v. Sinclair. 
    But we are addressing another issue. 
    Now, respondent and amicus, we believe, erroneously attempt to convert some legislative history dealing with the Case bill as dispositive of the present issue. 
    And in that sense they attempt to persuade the Court that the Case bill discussions, which did deal with the issue of discipline being the sole remedy available to employers in an unauthorized strike, is applicable to the Taft-Hartley bill. 
    And I direct the Congress's discussion as to 10(d) of the Case bill as the points in question that respondent attempts to emphasize. 
    They contend that this language and the congressional discussion attendant to this language provides a basis for the premise that Congress must have intended that discipline should be the sole remedy available to the employer. 
    I believe these arguments avoid two very significant facts. 
    One, the provisions of 10(d) of the Case bill did not survive the Taft-Hartley and, in fact, show up only briefly in the early days of the Taft-Hartley and disappear inexplicably. 
    And we can't find out why, in reading the congressional history, but it disappeared. 
    And the discussion relied upon by the respondents as well as the three circuit courts which have discussed this matter, do not recognize that this discussion was not repeated, it was not an integral part of the congressional history of the Taft-Hartley. 
    Effort to impose upon the Taft-Hartley the meaning of a provision not included within it seems to be erroneous in the opinion of petitioners. 
    Moreover, the role of congressional silence as the adoption of a controlling rule of law is less treacherous, as I reflect the verbiage of this Court in Boys Markets. 
    We believe that more dispositive of the present issue, is the discussion in the House conference report, in the Taft-Hartley itself, where the House rejected the Senate's proposed unfair labor practice involving breaches of collective bargaining agreements, which ostensibly would have encompassed a violation of a no strike clause; omitted that provision, in deference to the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements by the usual processes of law, a principle noted by this Court in Dowd Box and reflected in the House conference report, No. 510, p. 52. 
    Petitioners respectfully submit that a damage remedy against the provenl violators of a contract certainly is more consistent with the usual processes of law than the total absence of such remedy or the total dependence upon a disciplinary device which is suggested by the courts, the circuit courts and respondents.

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    No, I certainly would not at this point. 
    I feel I am limited to whatever remedy is available under the federal law at this point in the development of the federal labor laws. 
    And the problem that we have as petitioners is that we don't know what that remedy is under the current state of the law. 
    In the context of the absence of any explicit congressional mandate, and at best an ambiguous congressional history, we look as petitioners to the language of this Court to determine the logic of our suggested remedy.

    Mr. R. Ian Hunter 
    That's right. 
    And it was so found, barred us in the early stages of that strike. 
    Now, as I understand it, Lincoln Mills directs that the lower courts fashion a body of substantive federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, which was viewed by this Court a paramount concern of Congress. 
    The Court recognized that the act itself provided some specific guidance. 
    Other problems, admittedly, were within the penumbra of the express statutory mandate. 
    This Court envisioned that union as well as employee should be bound to the collective bargaining agreements. 
    And the lower courts were asked to look at the policy of the legislation and fashion a remedy or remedies that would effectuate that policy, the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements. 
    The degree of judicial inventiveness would be determined by the nature of the problem. 
    We appealed to the judicial inventiveness of the 6th Circuit and were told that the remedy we sought was not available. 
    We suggest that that was an error on the part of the 6th Circuit and the issue was framed accordingly. 
    Smith v. Evening News brings to fruition the ability of employees, ostensibly those same employees involved in this work stoppage, to enforce their rights under the collective bargaining agreement, and to bring an action under 301 to enforce the employer's obligation to them, whether be he terminated for unjust cause or whether his seniority was violated, but the employer is expected to comply with the collective bargaining agreement and if the union doesn't take care of it, the employee is entitled to under the conditions enunciated by this Court in its Vaca v. Sipes and Hines v. Anchor cases. 
    So the employee is clearly made a party for enforcement purposes by this Court, I think consistent with the congressional intent, and as this case, wherein the petitioner seeks to allow the employer to enforce a right afforded it by its employees when they seek to ignore both the contract and their local union.

    Most of whom, as I understand it, knew nothing about what was being boycotted, unlike here where we only would be able to sustain damages against those individuals who knowingly had violated the collective bargaining agreement. 
    Boys Markets, the next in this Court's line of decision, reflects this Court's recognition of the vital importance of the no strike agreement to the employer. 
    This Court characterized it as the quid pro quo upon which the employer agreed to submit its industrial disputes to arbitration. 
    An injunction was justified by this Court to enjoin violation of that important provision. 
    And it recognized in Boys Market that frequently the circumstances surrounding the passage of labor legislation changes to a degree that it is necessary entirely to emphasize remedies and impose responsibilities not necessarily contemplated by Congress at the time that they passed that labor legislation in question. 
    We then come to this Court's decision in Carbon Fuel which I believe puts into perspective the urgency of this Court's decision as to the issue submitted today. 
    Carbon Fuel found that a labor organization is not obligated for the damages imposed by people acting beyond the common law rule of agency in the midst of a violation of a no strike clause. 
    That puts into focus the Atkinson v. Sinclair where individuals were not responsible for the actions of their union, and Carbon Fuel puts into the law that unions are not responsible for the actions of individuals not acting as their agents. 
    The question we now raise, are those individuals who violate that contract responsible to the employer, given the fact that the labor organization is not?

    --undesirable. 
    Well, one comment before... I just want to make one point that respondents' and amicus's contention that discharge is a better solution and a better deterrent doesn't really make a lot of sense to me. 
    Discharge has been viewed by many as industrial capital punishment and I don't think the employees being terminated are necessarily going to find their relationship with their employer any more harmonious than if they were being subjected to a lawsuit merely to collect those damages that they cost the employer.

    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    Under Section 301, I am maintaining, they would not be, because Congress in enacting the legislation created these rights that can be used to enforce the terms of the contract to a specific group. 
    And I say, it bound the union, it made the union responsible for its actions. 
    It makes... when I say it makes the employees responsible, it makes it that if the employee breaches the terms of a contract and the employer acts by disciplining or discharging the employee, the employee has, what I say, no recourse. 
    The enactment, at the time Section 301 was enacted, the Taft-Hartley Act added union unfair labor practices, it also stated that if an employer discharges an employee and the employer has cause, the employee does not have a right of action under the National Labor Relations Act to allege that his discharge was violative of that.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Justice Rehnquist's question takes me back to the one I put to your friend at the outset: are you saying that you have the same kind of claim as though you have individual contracts with these employees with no union involved at all? 
    And I think he said, yes. 
    Now, to take the Ingrid Bergman or any other star, if Ingrid Bergman, for example, made a private contract, is not a member of any union, then walked off the scene when they'd done half of the film and spent millions of dollars, would there not be a suit for breach of contract for damages against her?

    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    There conceivably could be, if their rights were violated.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2118.541" stopTime="2137.618">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Then the question arises, whether 301 precludes... now, you, you, I take it, concede that there being no union contract, there being no 301 problem, the producer could have an action for breach of contract against the actor or actress.

    There's no equitable remedy available because they can't compel the painting of a picture or the performance of a work of art. 
    So, what is the difference, then, because there happens to be a collective bargaining contract?

    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    See, the 301 action would refer to the ability under 301 to obtain a damage... the remedy of damages against employees participating in an unauthorized work stoppage, it seems to me. 
    And I say that under Section 301, which created certain type of rights which permitted certain types of actions against a union, that to presume because the language does not specifically say that the employer, you cannot sue individual employees individually for their participation in an unauthorized work stoppage, thereby you can read that into it because it doesn't explicitly say you can't. 
    I'm saying, in a statute of this type where there are rights that are created, you should... if it was Congress' intent to have a remedy such as a damage remedy against individual employees who participate in unauthorized work stoppages, it should have been explicitly stated and expressly stated.

    Now, does that just mean the employer and the labor organization who are "the parties" who, to the contract? 
    Would it permit in an individual who is a beneficiary of that contract to sue for rights under the contract? 
    Suing for rights under the contract, this Court, I would say, allowed in suits such as Smith, allowed in suits such as--

    Right, my answer would be the same again. 
    Now... and, what I see, employer petitioner really has obtained all the relief that it can under the statute. 
    As I mentioned, they did obtain a Boys Market injunction, they did discipline and discharge employees, and they obtained the union's cooperation by not authorizing the work stoppage. 
    The... okay, in enacting the Section 301, the Congress indicated what it wanted to do is, it tended to make unions accountable. 
    They wanted to insure enforcement of the contracts; I think did not want to impose a damage action remedy against individual employees who participated in unauthorized work stoppages; and again, it allows the employer the ability to discharge employees who were involved in an unauthorized work stoppage by disciplining them and/or discharging them.

 And yet your construction of 301 would immunize workers who worked under a collective bargaining agreement that was obtained by collective activity from any damage remedy. 
 Whereas a single worker who signed an agreement to work would be liable.

    If the single worker was covered under the collective bargaining agreement, I don't... okay, what I'm... I guess, if you could imagine a situation where there were 100 employees and only one walked out, yet caused the employer damages, and what I would maintain is, that employee could only be discharged. 
    The fact that he caused his employer monetary damages, the employer could not bring a 301 action against the employee for the damages imposed.

    Well, I think that it can be brought against... okay, it has been brought against both. 
    Had I looked... looking backward, I may have in 1976 raised certain question at the point of time that initially the employer decided it wasn't going to pursue it any further against the union. 
    But both parties were initially brought under the lawsuit. 
    The lawsuit was filed against individuals as well as the local, and the international, and there was a work cessation and the court enjoined it and enjoined everybody at the time, including the employees.

    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    --We don't know. 
    Your Honor, in looking at the legislative history, there was a congressional concern to avoid the repetition of Danbury Hatters, and as this Court recognized in the Atkinson case, that what the way the lawsuit developed was that it was only the individual employees who were sued, and it was only the individual employees who had a judgment against them. 
    And the $250,000 that the Danbury Hatters employees were sued pales in significance to the amount of dollars that are being sought in this particular case. 
    Now, that really has no bearing, but, see, Congress was concerned that under Danbury that they didn't want to have a repetition of Danbury Hatters, and my contention is, with respect to that, is that not only in the situation where you could say conceivably it was the union that was at fault. 
    I think Congress spoke and said, we do not want to have a situation where individual employees would be responsible in damages for even unauthorized work stoppages, their breaches of the collective bargaining agreement.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3302.079" stopTime="3305.265">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    What section do you rely on for that? 
    What language?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3305.265" stopTime="3414.903">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    Okay. 
    I relied on the fact that had Congress intended to include and allow damage actions such as petitioner is seeking, it would have said so. 
    Okay? 
    Now, the reason that I say that is that it was, what I say, creating these rights in this legislation. 
    So if it intended to do it, it would have said it. 
    And you should not by implication say it is there because there's nothing in the language of the statute one way or the other. 
    The reason that I feel that in 301(b) there's the language that says that if a union is responsible for a breach you should not look to the employees, is that that was the only type of remedy, monetary remedy that Congress was willing to allow. 
    They were willing to allow a damage action against unions if they had breached the terms of the contract. 
    And if they, the union, breached the terms of the contract, you can get a money damage remedy against them. 
    But not against the employees. 
    And that is the only type of money damage remedy that in effect was flowing from 301 that was hitting, directed at the union, and if it's directed at the union, you can't direct it at, you can't collect from the employees. 
    And there was no intention to permit a damage remedy against the individual employees. 
    Okay, now--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3414.903" stopTime="3428.777">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    So what you're saying is that Congress said, yes, you can collect from the union, if the union breaches the contract, that is, if the walkout is with the union's approval. 
    But the individual members are immune from liability?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3428.777" stopTime="3431.964">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    --From financial liability. 
    They are not immune, no, but--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3431.964" stopTime="3432.730">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    From financial--
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3432.730" stopTime="3475.324">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    --Right; financial liability, and as I said, the reason that that was the case is that Congress recognized, and acknowledged, that employees who do participate in unauthorized activity, who breach the contract, are subject to discharge and discipline, and they have no protection under the Act. 
    And that was the type of relief that was afforded them. 
    I don't think that any arguments of mutuality because the employee can sue the employer for money damages thereby entitles the employer to sue the employee for money damages.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3475.324" stopTime="3480.045">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    --Is there any express language in the Acts authorizing an injunction?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3480.045" stopTime="3485.113">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    No, but we have an overwhelming--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3485.113" stopTime="3487.715">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    That's been read into the statute, now, hasn't it?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3487.715" stopTime="3496.421">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    --We have an overwhelming policy to promote, to promote the adherence to the terms of the contract.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3496.421" stopTime="3500.791">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    That's been read into the statute, notwithstanding the Norris-La Guardia Act?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3500.791" stopTime="3574.005">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    That is correct. 
    Under Boys Market. 
    We read it, in those limited situations that the Court outlined in Boys Market. 
    This Court, in Boys Market, also acknowledged that even... and one of the reasons maybe that it was granted, that injunctive relief was granted in Boys Market, was this Court's acknowledgment that even to permit a damage action which happens when an employer sues a union is not conducive to promoting industrial stability, and that was a main purpose of the Act, to promote industrial stability. 
    Now, you will not promote... I maintain you will not promote industrial stability by allowing the damage remedy action. 
    This petitioner has discharged employees, it's almost five years after the incident in question, it's still pursuing the remedy of damages, and it does nothing but exacerbate the industrial peace.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3574.005" stopTime="3580.661">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, of course, then a wildcat strike also exacerbates industrial peace, doesn't it?
speaker="hiram_s_grossman" startTime="3580.660" stopTime="3605.926">
    Mr. Hiram S. Grossman 
    It does. 
    I'm not going to say that it doesn't, but within two weeks... and that's a long time... the entire matter was settled in terms of the, from the time that the action began to the time that they were ordered back to work, two weeks elapsed. 
    And thereafter the discharges occurred which would have ended it but for this.
