    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Clayton v. International Union and the consolidated case. 
    Mr. McTernan, you may proceed when you're ready.
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="13.745" stopTime="288.401">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a Section 301 action instituted by petitioner Clayton, my client, claiming that his employer, petitioner ITT, discharged him without just cause in violation of the collective agreement and that his bargaining agent, the UAW, violated its duty to represent him fairly by withdrawing his discharge grievance from the arbitration process. 
    Clayton's action seeks what has been called by this Court in Vaca v. Sipes judicial enforcement of his contractual rights, and to us that means either a hearing... it means a hearing before a tribunal which can either reactivate his grievance or determine his right to reinstatement. 
    In the court below both the ITT and UAW asserted as affirmative defenses Clayton's failure to resort to his internal union procedures. 
    By virtue of an order of trifurcation that issue was tried first and the district court held that the union procedures were adequate to afford him the remedy he sought and dismiss the action against both defendants. 
    On appeal the dismissal of the claim against the union was affirmed and the dismissal of the claim against the employer was reversed and remanded for trial. 
    It is true and uncontestable that Clayton did not resort in any way to his internal union procedures. 
    He was justified in that, we contend, because to have done so would have been an utterly idle act. 
    The UAW procedures, we submit, were inadequate as a matter of law; they were inadequate in the facts of this case because they could not effect a reactivation of his grievance or his reinstatement; and they were inadequate because they were incapable of rendering a decision within the four-month period allowed in Section 411(a)(4) in the first proviso. 
    First, as to our position that the union procedure was inadequate as a matter of law, we rely first upon principles enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Marine Shipbuilding Workers to the effect that where the employee's complaint raises matters in the public domain and go beyond internal union procedures, the union procedures cannot be used to delay his resort to the court, to the National Labor Relations Board, for vindication of his rights under Section 8(b)(1)(a) of the amended National Labor Relations Act. 
    Here, too, Clayton asserts rights in the public domain, his right to fair representation, the union's duty fairly to represent him, a duty as developed by judicial interpretation and application of Section 9(a) of the amended National Labor Relations Act. 
    And we think that the rights involved stand on the same footing as the rights involved in NLRB against the Marine Shipbuilders. 
    The principle that I have just tried to enunciate or elaborate was applied by the 9th Circuit in Bise v. the I.B.E.W. with a similar result. 
    But perhaps more fundamental than this and going to the competence of the union tribunal is the fact that we deal here with rights governed by federal law. 
    This Court has enunciated in a number of cases... Vaca v. Sipes, and Motorcoach Employees v. Lockridge, the automobile case, the name of it escapes me for a moment... Humphrey v. Moore... that there's a duty of fair representation. 
    The claim of the breach of that duty is part and parcel of the Section 301 action, and it is controlled by federal law, and the last formulation of that in the Lockridge case was to the effect that whether the proof established the requisites of the breach of duty is a matter of federal law.

    Well, has the Court really held that these are 301 actions?

    And I think that there are other opinions from this Court as well as many in the courts of appeals which say that the breach of the duty claimed is part of the Section 301 action.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, I am unable to recall whether the employers were involved in those actions or not. 
    Oh, excuse me, they were in Humphrey v. Moore, but in Steele I'm not sure. 
    But the rest of what you said I accept as true, yes. 
    That's the way I recall it. 
    But what I want to emphasize in response to Mr. Justice Stewart is that the claim of breach of the duty of fair representation is coupled with the claim of breach of the collective agreement. 
    And the employee is allowed to sue the employer in court, thus not being involved in the arbitration proceeding, only by virtue as proof that the union has breached its duty to him. 
    So I say that if we deal here with matters of federal law under Section 301 both with reference to the claim of the breach of duty and the claim of breach of the collective agreement, we deal with matters which are entrusted to the courts under Section 301, the statute explicitly to this effect, and only the courts can interpret and apply that law; the UAW tribunals are not competent to do so. 
    And for the courts to delegate, if you will, that responsibility to the courts would be a violation of the principles of Lincoln Mills, and therefore I say that for all of these reasons that this UAW procedure was inadequate as a matter of law.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Well, it's conditioned upon proof that the Union breached its duties, and this Court has held that the employees may sue the employer alone and prove in that action the union's breach of duty, and therefore establish his right to go ahead on the merits of his breach of the collective agreement claim. 
    Now, when we get to damages we have another problem and as the Court said in Vaca v. Sipes, the union's liability to the employee in these cases is only for the increases, if any, and the pecuniary damage done to the employee by reason of the union's conduct, but the union cannot be held liable on damages for the damages caused by the employer's conduct. 
    And so the doctrine of comparative fault, if you will, is established in Vaca so as to involve an appointment of the damages as between the employer and the union. 
    Have I answered your question, sir?

    Mr. Justice White, this Court has been very careful to distinguish those cases in which the conduct of the employer and the conduct of the union were independent and discrete, and where each would be then liable for his proportionate share of the damage caused. 
    But where they act together, as was pointed out in the opinion in Czosek v. O'Mara, there you have a different problem, and there can be joint liability because they acted jointly.

    Well, sir, I don't think that it's consistent with Lincoln Mills for the judiciary to delegate to union tribunals the interpretation and application of federal law under Section 301; number one. 
    And number two, I think that however detached and dignified the union tribunal is and however fast it could act, it simply is unable functionally to effect the most important aspect of the restoration of this employee's contractual rights, namely, his right to have his job back.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    I think that there is no unqualified duty to exhaust. 
    I think that exhaustion which involves the union tribunal and the interpretation and application of federal law would be a miscarriage of the doctrine under Lincoln Mills. 
    However, I can see the situation in which, if the union tribunal had the power to reactivate the grievant by finding that the union breached its duty, there might be some room there for requiring exhaustion, assuming that the time limitations could be satisfied. 
    In that we have a problem here. 
    In this case, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is no provision in the collective bargaining agreement for the arbitration or further processing of grievances which the union decided it had withdrawn in breach of its duty. 
    As a matter of fact, as I intended to say later, there is evidence in this record of an intent quite to the contrary. 
    There was a stipulation at the trial that one, the grievance was withdrawn from arbitration. 
    It was the end of the road so far as the contract remedies were concerned, and my colleagues here advised the trial court that ITT conceded that it had no obligation whatever to reconsider the grievance even if the union found that there had been a breach of its duty.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    But let me say that in your opinion in Vaca v. Sipes, you considered the question of whether the Court should decide the collective bargaining contract issue or whether it should be remanded for arbitration, and the Court held there, in your language, that this was a remedy for the trial court to consider in light of the circumstances of the particular case. 
    And it seems to me that's a very sound approach to it, because I don't think it's possible to make an inflexible rule.

   Argument of Everett F. Meiners
speaker="everett_f_meiners" startTime="1085.786" stopTime="1161.944">
    Mr. Everett F. Meiners 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to initially direct my comments to the very difficult if not impossible situation which the lower court decision has left the employer in. 
    The employer must defend the union's good faith as a result of that decision in refusing to go to arbitration. 
    The employer, of course, was not a party to that decision, wherein the union made the determination that there was no cause in their mind, no justification, to take that grievance that Mr. Clayton had filed and that they had initially requested arbitration. 
    They concluded that there was no reason to take that matter to arbitration, that they could not prevail on that case. 
    But the employer was not a party to that process. 
    In the grievance procedure and arbitration procedure the union is the party that investigates that procedure and makes that determination. 
    The company did not take any action and was not involved in any manner in a determination or an attempt to convince the union not to proceed to arbitration.

 Mr. Meiners, as I've tried to think through this argument that the employer is in an impossible position because he doesn't know the facts, but isn't it correct that the employee has the burden, rather severe burden, of showing arbitrary conduct by the union and what it really amounts to is, you have two defenses? 
 You still have your defense that you didn't reach the contract in the first place, and you have the additional defense that maybe he can't prove arbitrary conduct. 
 It seems to me that's a better position than the employers are in a lot of lawsuits. 
 Well, but not as good a position as you're in right now, having won in the arbitration.

    The problem that you have is that the unions may get to the... or the employee may reach the underlying grievance without having to be held to the strong burden of establishing a breach of a duty of fair representation that he may have to establish with the union as party.

    Mr. Everett F. Meiners 
    That's correct. 
    However, that destroys the efficacy of the arbitration grievance procedure which normally is a complete block to the issue of the underlying, reaching the issue of the underlying grievance unless there's a breach of the duty of fair representation by reason of the lower court's decision in this case. 
    It is true the prima facie case, is still there but there may not be a defense or if there is a defense which the employer has to present, he has to either subpoena or try and obtain the cooperation of the union in being able to present some kind of a defense to that case. 
    He is not the party that has the information to present a case that shows the reason why the union did not breach its duty of fair representation. 
    I think this illustrates from the company's viewpoint the severe problem that we see in this type of situation. 
    It is not a case that may occur every time by any means, but the union may for political reasons take a viewpoint that is going to remain neutral; it's not going to encourage or assist the employer in presenting a defense to the breach of the duty of fair representation.

    Mr. Everett F. Meiners 
    Well, that may be true, yes. 
    We would hope so, if we were ever called upon to present that case. 
    But the problem here is one of whether or not the union's decision not to proceed to arbitration is one which the employee at will can avoid? 
    And whether or not the exclusivity that the union has is going to be affirmed, and what burden is going to be placed on the union for their actions as opposed to the company for their actions. 
    We're certainly more than willing and we're willing initially to defend this matter in arbitration. 
    But now we're six years down the road. 
    The back pay that Mr. McTernan referred to as early reinstatement is a situation which has a tremendous impact upon the employer at this point.

 And normally the company is perfectly able to substantiate the reasons there's no merit to claim. 
 I'm a little puzzled about why it's such a burden. 
 This doesn't necessarily reach the merit of the ultimate outcome of the case.

    If you look at the practical viewpoint of presenting the defense to the breach of the duty, I think that's the... we're skipping over the defense which has to be presented or should be presented. 
    Why should the employee... I guess maybe we can get back to this... why should the employee be able to go to arbitration and require a resolution of this issue if the union in good faith had made a determination that this is not an issue that should be resolved in arbitration?

    Well, I think that for a lot of the reasons that we have indicated that this presents... puts the union and the company in a very difficult position to attempt to present a case on behalf of a party which it had no knowledge of. 
    For instance, we would have to, if this case were to go back down to trial or to arbitration, the company would have to commence some type of a discovery process, compulsory discovery process possibly, in order to obtain the facts which could be used to present a defense to the breach of the duty of fair representation. 
    Certainly, we're in possession of and would be able to present the facts with respect to the underlying grievance itself.

    --Yes, there could. 
    And I think that from the employer's viewpoint, this gets back to the basic problem that we see whereby this type of a case may end up for resolution before a court and/or a jury. 
    It is our belief that the better method to resolve this controversy would be to have a remand of the case to arbitration and for the arbitrator to review the issues and to make the ultimate decision which he should have made, should have been called upon to make. 
    But we look at the decision of this Court in the Nolde Brothers case as possibly a basis whereby this Court can determine that there is a theory where, that the exhaustion of internal union remedies may result in the reinstatement of the grievance in the arbitration procedure. 
    In that case, of course, the--

    Mr. Everett F. Meiners 
    Because I believe that the Nolde Brothers decision raises a substantial question as to whether or not because of the national labor policy that is deemed to be incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement when it is written, that... and in that case the decision indicated that unless the agreement expressly or directly negated the possibility of the grievance in that instance... of course the contract had expired... I think that the same situation can be said to apply here. 
    There's nothing in the contract which expressly provides that if there is a violation of the breach of the duty of fair representation, that the grievance cannot be reinstated in the procedure. 
    That subject is not discussed, and based on the strong national policy which favors arbitration as a method of resolution of these disputes, we would suggest that the processing of Mr. Clayton's claims through the internal union procedures could resolve--

    Mr. Everett F. Meiners 
    --Correct. 
    But it's not in our area, fortunately. 
    So that, we can see a situation under your Nolde Brothers decision and looking at Vaca v. Sipes, that the employee does have a right that if there is a determination by an internal union remedy, that the employee does have the right to reinstitute the grievance and to proceed back into arbitration. 
    And I think that one of the points that needs to be examined is the posture of the employee when he goes back to the arbitration procedures. 
    I think that the employee should raise if... there are a number of different cases, some cases where the union is clearly discriminating against the individual. 
    In other cases they have merely let lapse the time limit, in a situation where they've let a time limit lapse negligently or whatever the standard is that makes that act be a breach of the duty of fair representation.

    I think that one of the possibilities is that the employee may obtain his own counsel in an appropriate case. 
    I think that this is a matter which should be raised before the internal union remedy, before the PRB in this instance, to determine that maybe there is an internal discrimination against him, and he needs additional protection.

    Yes. 
    The union, of course, has a broad range of authority here and is only held to a very stringent standard, and it is generally authorized, of course, under Vaca v. Sipes to be the exclusive agent and to represent the employees in all of their cases, and to make determinations if sometimes the case that the employee is wanting to pursue through arbitration is not justified, and even though it might sacrifice some rights of his for the entire unit, that the approach taken by the union is the correct approach. 
    So that the union does have a broad authority in that type of determination.

   Argument of M. Jay Whitman
speaker="m_jay_whitman" startTime="2362.913" stopTime="2456.142">
    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The union's approach and concerns and perspectives here are quite different from those of either Mr. Clayton or ITT. 
    To begin with let's be clear about what this Court does and does not have to decide in this matter. 
    The union, particularly the UAW, is not interested in getting into the business of judging federal rights. 
    We are not enfranchised by Article III. 
    The Court needn't in the situation presented here reconsider or revisit Vaca or Maddox or Hines or any of these issues. 
    This is a case where Mr. Clayton made no attempt at all, where he was told he was a steward, the remedies were facially adequate. 
    There are really only three logically possible sorts of case that can arise. 
    One is this case, the no-attempt case, where no attempt was made. 
    The second is the case alluded, sort of case, category of case alluded to by Mr. Justice Stevens, where an attempt is made but the contractual provisions are fashioned in a way so that the grievance and arbitration procedures are perpetually open to the possibility that the union through internal review might reverse itself and order its agents to reinstitute the matter into the grievance procedure and hence to arbitration. 
    That's the case, for example, in the General Motors, Ford, Chrysler--

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    That takes us to the third set of cases, Your Honor. 
    If that problem arose in the General Motors system, it would go back into the arbitration procedure. 
    Or if it arose in General Electric, where there are no time limits, it could be refiled without any trouble. 
    Or it could arise in a contract where an individual can decide to go to arbitration or not, that the union has no exclusive right to make that decision. 
    You are quite right; that is not this case. 
    This is a no-attempt case. 
    The third sort of case is a case where the attempt is made but if the contract procedures in the regular course of their operations were allowed to function, the grievance and arbitration procedure would close. 
    Those are the sorts of cases where there is a dispute as to whether or not the matter is arbitrable. 
    Now, I can address, if I will, all those cases, but I would like to stress that the issues that have been discussed earlier, many of the issues are issues which arise only on that third set of cases, which is not this case. 
    This is a case where no attempt was made of any sort. 
    And so the Court really needn't get into those areas, particularly on this sort of a record.

 What's the source of the duty of the employee to make an attempt?

speaker="m_jay_whitman" startTime="2579.795" stopTime="2628.291">
    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    The source of the duty, Your Honor, is the discretion of the federal judiciary in Article III. 
    It's an inherent discretion of the district court to stay its hand until the controversy is ripe, consistent with federal policy and consistent with Republic Steel v. Maddox, to see that individuals are told that they ought to ask the store manager, they ought to give the union a fair opportunity to take a crack at this. 
    Now, if the fair opportunity comes to ground, if it's futile, I mean, if he's told, as was the case in Glover, that this is not for blacks, that's a different matter. 
    But the federal courts ought to have the discretion and ought to apply it as a routine matter consistent with Maddox to hold their hand, at least for that period.

    Well, is the conclusion that the federal judge should reach... now, it's a kind of the federal judge is both the lawmaker and the decider under your view... that if there's no attempt whatsoever to get the union to review the decision, that ipso facto establishes an inability to prove a breach of the duty of fair representation. 
    Then it would necessarily follow, it seems to me, that the employer would be entitled to the benefit of that holding.

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    The better result would be for the trial bench not to rush into putting the employer in the sort of dilemma of nonfinality which was presented in the Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight. 
    But it may come to the point that the employer simply will not... that the union reverses itself and the employer refuses to reentertain the grievance, or insist on the contractual remedies. 
    The employer, at that point, it seems to me, has chosen litigation over arbitration. 
    Now, the employer may not do that. 
    The contractual provision, like the General Motors or General Electric provisions, might require him to put it back in, in which case the problem will go away.

    One is to the Convention Appeals Committee, which originated as a standing committee of the convention. 
    It's a body of delegates, elected delegates, rank and file, selected by lot, that meets every six months and decides that. 
    Or alternatively, the man can go to the Public Review Board and tell his problems to Dean St. Antoinne and Robin Fleming and gentlemen of that sort.

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    It depends on the case. 
    As I mentioned in the brief, if you have a 30-day time limit and he files on day two rather than on day thirty it's faster. 
    But we have competing values here. 
    In the UAW system, for example, we've been very careful to insert due process and protections at each stage. 
    Of course, as the Court well knows, any time you insert due process there is the prospect of litigants generating delay. 
    If you insist on a complete record being sent from the local union, one has to write a letter to the local union and get the record and be sure it's complete, and so on. 
    The same thing is true if counsel is allowed, as is the case here--

    This Court held in Vaca, as I read it, that he doesn't. 
    In Vaca, in fact, there was a separate piece of litigation pending at the trial court level. 
    Vaca was only brought against the union. 
    This can, it can occur in the reverse situation, or it can occur, and it most commonly does, these days, in the Ford v. Huftman context where both are sued.

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    Well, Your Honor, yes, he often is. 
    In fact, it's ironic that his percentage of success is greater before the Convention Appeals Committee and the delegates than it is before the Public Review Board. 
    They more frequently reverse the International Executive Board. 
    If I had to say as a rule of thumb, of the dozen cases that come up every six months, the national department or part of the union is probably knocked down in at least one, perhaps two of those cases, in recent times. 
    While this, of course, isn't in the record, some years ago I did a count of the Public Review Board decisions that reversed, and it struck me that the percentage was roughly equivalent to the percentage of trial court decisions that are reversed by this Court, if you compare it to the percentage of cases on which there is a petition for certiorari. 
    The difference is that the Public Review Board can't deny cert. It has to take them all.

    But that brings us back to the need for a delicacy in this area. 
    I mean, the duty of fair representation was created by this Court to preserve the delicate balance between individual rights and the collective interest, and to maintain that. 
    And that's what Vaca and Steele and all those cases hold, and that this is not an area, for that very reason, for sweeping and per se rules, for taking discretion from the district bench and saying that never in any situation must there ever even an attempt be made. 
    The only thing the Court needs to decide here is whether in the attempt case, the union should be given a fair opportunity? 
    Now, practically speaking, a couple of things are going to happen. 
    Given a man, or woman, the grievant, is going to be flatly wrong about his claim under the contract and the union is going to be able to convince him he's wrong and he'll forget about it and go away, well, he won't forget about it; he'll litigate, frivolous though it may be. 
    And if that happens, it happens. 
    There's no... I mean, I'm not going to stand here and say that this procedure is going to warranty the federal judiciary against having to see frivolous grievances--

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    --Yes, and for that reason, I think, in the appropriate case the district court would be well advised to say to the employer, wouldn't it be nice if at least on an ad hoc basis you are willing to accept this back into the grievance and arbitration case, should the union reverse itself, or hold its hand to see what happens. 
    Bur it's a frequent practice in the trial bench now that what the Court does is, it enters a stay of the proceedings and tells the fellow to go off and take an appeal, and then sees what happens. 
    The problem is that Mr. McTernan's position would remove even that authority. 
    It's a broad position. 
    What it really is, is going back to Mr. Justice Black's dissent in Republic Steel v. Maddox, which as you know--

    Mr. M. Jay Whitman 
    --True. 
    It goes back that far. 
    But the proposition is a simple one that's being urged by Mr. Clayton, that a fellow ought to be able to get a lawyer and sue, now, without attempting, without pausing, without asking the higher-ups in the union, without seeing if they remedy his complaint. 
    Even if the grievant is not wronged by this claim, there may be a greater wrong, a wrong to the collective interest. 
    And the union and the individual ought to have a chance to address that and see if the man can't be convinced that the union and the rest of his workers will be worse off. 
    It's like cross-examination. 
    You're very often in a position where you don't ask a question because you may be worse off asking it and having the answer than never having asked it at all. 
    And that's often the case with grievance and arbitration cases. 
    I mean, if we arbitrate a weak case, the employer may find himself armed with an invulnerable precedent for the unceremonious discharge of arguably similar cases. 
    And that's where this balance of collective and individual interest is important, and it's a scant price to suggest that a man must at least attempt.

   Rebuttal of John T. McTernan
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3620.429" stopTime="3723.061">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Mr. Justice Stevens, as I understand it, the duty to exhaust is a requirement which derives from the first proviso of 411(a)(4). 
    But whether the requirement will be imposed is a matter of judicial discretion. 
    In the trial court that requirement was imposed on the ground that the union remedy could afford this man money as a complete answer to his entire problem. 
    And we take the position, I think it's correct, and it follows the policy laid down in Chambers and other cases which we cite, that he may not be required to resort to a remedy that cannot give him the relief he seeks. 
    And to require him to take money in place of what I concede to be a unique job is certainly to deny him the relief he seeks. 
    This man had 8-1/2 years' seniority; he was a black worker, in a market area where the black rate of unemployment is twice that of whites, and he's thrown out and lost his 8-1/2 years and he can never regain it. 
    He has to have, it seems to me, a right to get at reinstatement. 
    Now, so far, Mr. Chief Justice, as the tradition of exhausting all of these things before resort to court is concerned, I submit to you that exhaustion cannot be imposed arbitrarily and as an empty procedure. 
    What can he get out of going to the store manager, as Mr. Whitman put it? 
    He can get from the store manager at best an admission that the store manager was wrong. 
    And what does that get him? 
    It gets him possibly damages from the union sometime, after the liability of the employer is decided, but he still has to go to court to get his reinstatement rights determined.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Indeed it is, because then we have the right to discovery under the civil rules. 
    I would like to close with just one observation about the ease of these union remedies. 
    It isn't simply a matter of writing a letter to Douglas Fraser. 
    It's a matter of first going to the union local and having that considered, and then going to the International Executive Board through Mr. Fraser.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Well, 45 days... the local union must decide in 45 days. 
    The International Executive Board is required to use its best efforts to decide in 60 days, and of course each time there has to be a step to get the appeal filed farther up. 
    The union president, Mr. Fraser, has unfettered discretion to take a case over and decide it himself whenever he thinks it's appropriate, and he is under no time restraint. 
    The top level, the Public Review Board of the Constitutional Committee is under no time restraint. 
    And in that connection, Mr. Justice Brennan, I'd point out to you that the counsel for the PRB has said that this appeal structure is designed to produce an effective decision in approximately nine months to approximately 12 months.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    This case has been over five years, sir. 
    And may I point out to you that there are a couple of judicial experiences with this time thing. 
    In Ruzicka, which is cited very much in my opponent's brief, the employee had gone 27 months fruitlessly without a remedy under the UAW procedure. 
    And in the Maxwell case we cite to you, the employee had gone 17 months fruitlessly without a remedy. 
    And I say that, here, Clayton, had he resorted to this remedy, no matter what time it took, it would have been fruitless because he couldn't have got the relief he needs, and that is reinstatement.
