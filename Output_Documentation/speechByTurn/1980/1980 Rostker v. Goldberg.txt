    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question whether the Military Selective Service Act by providing for a male-only registration and classification for possible induction into the Armed Services violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment by invidiously discriminating against males. 
    This is an appeal from the judgment of a three-judge court determining that the male-only registration provision of the Military Selective Service Act offends the Constitution and enjoining proceedings pursuant to that Act. 
    There is no substantial dispute about the facts giving rise to this controversy. 
    Since 1948 the Military Selective Service Act has provided for the registration of males between the ages of 18 and 26 and their classification and induction into the Armed Services.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    All of them register, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    The classification system provides for exemptions and deferments. 
    This condition continued until 1973 when the Congress decided to experiment with an all-volunteer Army and the conscription provision of the statute was removed. 
    However, the registration and classification provisions continued, as they do today, in effect. 
    But in 1975 the President decided to discontinue the classification of persons under the Military Selective Service Act and this was the condition until 1980 when the President of the United States sent a message to the Congress indicating his desire because of foreign policy and military exigencies to reactivate the registration procedures and he also requested them to extend the scope of the requirements for registration and classification to include females. 
    The three-judge case which was--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="248.459" stopTime="259.433">
    Justice Jr. 
    --Might I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, is the registration statute explicit as to the permissible uses of the registration lists?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="259.433" stopTime="270.474">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --It is not. 
    It doesn't forbid the list for any purposes other than that the stated purposes, but it states the purpose for which it would be used.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="270.474" stopTime="278.497">
    Justice Jr. 
    Well, what I'm getting at, of course, is, may the registration lists be used, for example, to staff nonmilitary jobs?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="278.497" stopTime="280.830">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    It may--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="280.830" stopTime="291.887">
    Justice Jr. 
    What I'm thinking about is during the war, do you recall, when not we, but our allies had all kinds of registration lists which they then used to bring women into war industries.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="291.887" stopTime="298.625">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --If you're inquiring for service other than within the Armed Services, my understanding is that it does not.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="298.625" stopTime="299.327">
    Justice Jr. 
    It does not.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="299.327" stopTime="308.599">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    It's for induction into the military services. 
    It's not a universal service act, as I understand it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="308.599" stopTime="314.420">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except, I suppose, that people who are in certain classifications might be assigned outside the military?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="314.420" stopTime="411.065">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That was certainly done under the Act and I assume it was done lawfully. 
    Noncombatant service, within the service, and other service related to the national welfare, I think, was the rubric that was used during World War II, the Korean War, and the Southeast Asian hostilities. 
    The President requested the Congress to shift funds from the Department of Defense to the inactive Selective Service machinery to reactivate it, to commence the registration of males and females, as he requested, under this message that he sent. 
    The Congress considered the message and by joint resolution transferred funds from the Department of the Defense to the Selective Service Agency to permit it to function, but denied the request to expand the Selective Service requirement to have women register. 
    The three-judge case which had been commenced earlier in Philadelphia was then reactivated and the Court determined that by reason of the non-inclusion of women that there was an invidious discrimination against males, that the statute was unconstitutional because it offended the Fifth Amendment and it enjoined further classification.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="411.064" stopTime="424.891">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Solicitor General, you used the term, "reactivated". 
    When that original action in the three-judge District Court was brought in '71... was it? 
    1971? 
    was the statute we're now concerned with in the pleadings?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="424.891" stopTime="444.905">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    The statute was still in effect but in 1975 the President discontinued registration under the statute, so the statute still authorized the President by proclamation to reinstitute registration.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="444.905" stopTime="451.975">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So you have no problem about the action being the proper vehicle for the issues that are not here?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="451.975" stopTime="469.603">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We do not raise this in our jurisdictional statement. 
    We don't raise it now. 
    We believe the matter is properly before the Court and we certainly would rather have the Court adjudicate it now than to wait until a genuine emergency with an injunction preventing the President to act in the best interests of the country.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="469.603" stopTime="481.327">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, General McCree, may I ask, is the statute one that simply authorizes the President by proclamation to require registration or that it directs him?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="481.327" stopTime="484.962">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    It authorizes him by proclamation. 
    It does--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="484.962" stopTime="491.100">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And then after this 1980 action in Congress he did issue a proclamation?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="491.100" stopTime="525.004">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --He did issue a proclamation requiring young men who were born in 1960 and 1961 to register and then on a continuing basis persons who were born after January 1, 1963, on or before the 30 days prior to their 18th birthday. 
    And that is continuing now under a stay granted by this Court following our appeal from the determination of unconstitutionality.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    General McCree, I might have missed it. 
    Have these pleadings been amended?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="530.508" stopTime="536.712">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.

    Yes.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="537.331" stopTime="558.809">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    The pleadings were and parties were added because some of the original parties were beyond the registration limit at that time, the 26 age. 
    Persons were added so that there was an appropriate class of persons who were subject to the requirement of registration.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="558.809" stopTime="562.860">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is it now aimed at the new statute or the old?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="562.860" stopTime="575.520">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    It is aimed at the old statute because the statute wasn't changed to require the registration of women, and it's still a male-only registration statute.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="575.520" stopTime="579.222">

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That's clear. 
    It was a determination and in fact a challenge was not made that it invidiously discriminated against women. 
    Other grounds were asserted that the court didn't pass on. 
    They asserted that it took property without due process of law, that it violated the prohibition against involuntary servitude. 
    But those contentions were found to be insufficient and only on the invidious discrimination against males was the statute held invalid. 
    The court below employed what this Court has called in some of its decisions an intermediate level of scrutiny that required that the draft registration be substantially related to an important governmental objective. 
    And the court below determined that the findings of the Congress on the question of military need did not show an important governmental objective or substantial relation thereto, and made a very extended examination of what it regarded the showing that the Government had made. 
    We contend essentially two things here. 
    First we assert that because this case arises in the context of a power expressly granted to the Congress by the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, to raise an army, that the Court should apply the rational relationship standard in determining this validity. 
    We submit that raising an army and conducting war is sui generis.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    I think that's... I agree. 
    I can't argue with that. 
    I certainly can't quarrel with that assertion. 
    But we think that the fact that the Congress has told the... the Constitution tells the Congress, you raise the armies, you make rules for their governance, vest in them an authority that tells the courts that this is something that you should approach with great deference to the congressional primacy in this area. 
    There are many other areas in the Constitution, as the Court is well aware, that point up this special circumstance. 
    The writ of habeas corpus, for example, can be suspended in time of invasion. 
    And the 9th Circuit did uphold a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in World War II, although there had not been a physical invasion of the Hawaiian Islands; this court denied certiorari in this case. 
    But it's some evidence of what the Constitution intended the relationship of the Court and the Congress and the Executive Branch to be in this extraordinary circumstance of waging war or preparing to wage war.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1005.045" stopTime="1015.233">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is there anything in Article I, Section 8, that limits the power of Congress to raise and maintain armies just in time of war?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="1015.233" stopTime="1071.487">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    No, there is no limitation. 
    It's an authorization just to raise and maintain armies and naval forces. 
    It doesn't restrict it to time of war at all, and it tells, as we respectfully submit, it tells the courts that this is a matter where great deference should be paid to congressional determination. 
    And the Congress determined in this case that in the event of a mobilization what would be necessary would be raising an effective army expeditiously. 
    And to do this it would require flexibility. 
    And the flexibility that it would be afforded as the record clearly establishes is to have persons who could perform combatant as well as noncombatant roles in the Armed Services.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Yes, if the Court pleases. 
    There is evidence before the Court that although women can perform and have performed and still do perform effectively and with great credit in noncombatant roles that they are not eligible by statute and policy for certain roles in actual close combat and that it is--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1109.645" stopTime="1126.305">

    Well, does that add up to evidence that registration of women who surely are being used and could be used in other capacities than combat, does that add up to any evidence that the registration of women in and of itself would negatively affect it.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    --I think it does, because at this time, at the time of mobilization, what would be necessary would be persons who could be rotated among all of the military roles that might be required, and although women could perform and do perform and have performed efficiently in the noncombatant roles, they couldn't be rotated, and flexibility is what is needed, initially, at the time of mobilization. 
    There is evidence that through volunteer activity it is anticipated that a sufficient number of women would be available in the event of the mobilization that was projected by the Armed Services witnesses who testified here--

    For example, the Battle of the Bulge at the Ardennes, where cooks, bakers, everybody who could carry a rifle was pressed into service, those are roles forbidden today by statute and policy to women, for women to perform, and the testimony here is that the initial needs at mobilization would be for persons who could be rotated into any situation where there may be a military need and all we are arguing here is that the all-male registration at this time be granted.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think there are four propositions, none of which is seriously disputed in this case, which place into perspective just what is and what is not at issue in this case. 
    And I think these are four points of reference of which we ought not lose sight. 
    First, registering women for the draft does not dictate any number of women who will be drafted nor the roles which they would fill if they were drafted. 
    Instead, registration of women opens the possibility of drafting women to fill the very positions in which they may now or in the future serve as volunteers if there is not an adequate rate of volunteers for those positions.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    I think that the Court decided that in Feeney and noting in Feeney that the result of the veterans' preference winds up disproportionately favoring men was a function of the service, which, incidentally, was a result of the inequality of conscription, among other things. 
    I don't think that that would require the voiding of any veterans' preference statutes because the fact is still that the people served and earned their veterans' preference as opposed to being registered to serve. 
    And I think that, again, we come to the question, we can no more say who would have been drafted than we can say who will be drafted. 
    And it's that, particularly that prospective uncertainty that we don't know today what the military needs will be if and when we ever have to draft, that is really the distinction between registration on the one hand and conscription on the other.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    With all due respect, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we deny the existence of such a statute. 
    With respect to the Army, there is none. 
    With respect to the Navy, there is no statute barring women from combat, merely from assignment to ships or airplanes with combat missions. 
    For example, in the Navy, women are eligible for assignment to the Seals, which is the Navy version of the Green Beret Special Forces.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2350.031" stopTime="2358.870">

    You mean the statute?

    Right.
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2362.288" stopTime="2420.459">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    It would not directly implicate that statute. 
    I would point out that for now several years both the Air Force and the Navy, which are the only two services subject to such statutes, have been requesting the repeal of such statutes on grounds having absolutely nothing to do with registration or the draft, but merely having to do with their own military management. 
    So what we're really talking about is, I think, the Army situation where the Army now has the right to decide assignment questions according to its own lights, according to its own perceived needs, and I think this is one of the things which distinguishes particularly Admiral Hayward's testimony, because when he said, we will be able to fill it, he was talking about the Navy and the naval requirement for women is very small because the freedom of assignment in the Navy is very small. 
    In the Army it's a very different case.

speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2440.089" stopTime="2484.701">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    That is correct. 
    Indeed, the... one of the most important points that I would hope to make is that the District Court assumed the continuing applicability of all current limitations in all services on numbers and assignments of women, and still found as a fact that all-male registration did not enhance military flexibility or the ability of the nation to respond to the full range of possible futures which might confront us. 
    More importantly, in fact, it found that the exclusion of women from registration undermined military flexibility and that is a finding of fact which has not been attacked here as clearly erroneous. 
    And on the record, I submit, could not be attacked as clearly erroneous--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2484.701" stopTime="2493.890">
    Justice Jr.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Well, the finding of fact that military flexibility is in fact undermined by exclusion does not depend upon what test is used in the analysis. 
    That's a finding of fact that is based directly on the testimony of the military, and I would only comment here what the testimony of all of the Joint Chiefs was, and that was, we should register--

    We certainly would concede the legitimacy of the governmental interest in raising an adequate armed force. 
    That is indeed the statutory purpose. 
    What it would go to is the rational relationship, or on a heightened scrutiny basis, the substantial and close relationship to that interest, and in fact the finding of facts here as supported by the overwhelming record is that the exclusion of women from registration, which means excluding them from the pool of people to whom we can turn in time of war, in time of emergency, for the skills that we know they do possess and the very skills that we have sought to bring into the Armed Forces by increasing the female volunteer rate and the level or volunteer soldiers, we would exclude ourselves from being able to turn to those and the District Court found, and I submit, correctly, certainly not clearly erroneously, that that objective is undermined by excluding women from the registration pool.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    No, Your Honor, for two reasons I don't think an age discrimination case would have been appropriate. 
    First, the age discrimination standard is clearly the lowest standard. 
    And, more importantly, there are a great number of reasons consistent with the statute, particularly the maintenance of a strong economy and to minimize as equitable, fair, disruption of life that would be supported by limiting the exposure and... here again, we're talking of exposure of induction.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2735.727" stopTime="2759.442">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How do you distinguish the policy question involved in fixing the ages and the policy question made at this stage for limited purposes of excluding women? 
    Aren't they equally policy decisions by Congress, whether wise or unwise?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2759.442" stopTime="2809.977">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Well, to start with, the policy decision to exclude women which was made in 1948 was not a considered decision at all. 
    There was a good deal of testimony as to what a suitable age for exposure to service would be. 
    There was no such consideration of including or excluding women using traditional statutory interpretation methods, the contemporaneous statutory history before the same committees, the same Congress, at the same time, the Women's Armed Service Integration Act, I think was quite fairly characterized by the District Court as having been passed in an atmosphere permeated with chauvinism. 
    There were... the only testimony--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2809.977" stopTime="2821.333">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Since when is it the function of the courts to inquire into the atmosphere in which the Legislative Branch acts?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2821.333" stopTime="2829.320">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    --Where the atmosphere is shown in specific testimony, in specific statements.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2829.320" stopTime="2835.491">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, in a case of our Court, this Court, that... do you suggest that that's a proper criterion?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2835.491" stopTime="2905.987">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    I think that in the Arlington Heights case where the question came up, starting, if it's not clear on its face, we then look for congressional intent, indeed, in this very statute on the amendment that was considered in O'Brien, where you looked to whether there was any evidence of an improper intent. 
    Now, in that case, of course, you found that there was none. 
    In the case that's before you today, the clear testimony and the clear statements before Congress in 1948 to the effect that, well, no one would want a Wave officer commanding him, that the men would object to being under the command of women, that women would get married and so never qualify for pensions; the entire atmosphere... and, perhaps atmosphere was the wrong word for the District Court to use. 
    But the record is clear that there was nothing beyond stereotypical consideration.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2905.987" stopTime="2928.018">
    Justice Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Weinberg, if we disagree with the District Court and with you that there ought to be a heightened scrutiny standard here and agree with the Government that that it should just be the rational basis test, can we affirm the judgment of the District Court?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2928.018" stopTime="2929.118">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Yes, I believe you can.

    How?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2929.752" stopTime="2959.538">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Particularly, because the defense for the statute even under the rational relationship test is the military flexibility argument that the Solicitor General has described and because that argument simply does not relate in any rational way to either the facts or the intent of the statute, the function of the statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2959.538" stopTime="2983.939">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but if it's just a rational relationship, I would think if you, unless you disbelieve that you could get as many women as you wanted, or that were needed, on a voluntary basis, it would be quite rational to decide not to go through the entire rigamarole of registration and the drafting of women just to get the ones you could get without any expense whatsoever.
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="2983.939" stopTime="2991.026">

    We have history, to start with, that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3002.334" stopTime="3003.567">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well what record are you talking about?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3003.567" stopTime="3008.802">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    --The record before the trial court and the record before Congress. 
    There was great overlap between the two.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3008.802" stopTime="3022.445">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if we read the record different than you did and then thought that there was not only ample basis in the record but a finding, and evidence, that you can get the women without registration? 
    What then, under the rational relationship test?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3022.445" stopTime="3043.442">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    If it could be stated that we can safely predict that there would not arise a situation where volunteers would be inadequate, that would be a different situation, but that's not what we face with registration.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3043.442" stopTime="3046.142">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that isn't what I asked you. 
    Would that satisfy the rational relationship test?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3046.142" stopTime="3080.031">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Yes, if we had a guarantee, yes, is really would not be needed; the answer is yes. 
    And that goes, I think, to the very distinction between registration, which is insurance against failing to have volunteers and providing against the broad range of unpredictable futures which do confront us, and conscription, which is the decision when one of those futures becomes our present, to say, these are what our needs are. 
    We either have or don't have enough volunteers; we need to draft for certain positions.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3080.031" stopTime="3089.304">
    Justice Jr.

speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3089.304" stopTime="3106.348">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    Parker, like Glines and Huff, and Greer v. Spock, are so-called military enclave cases, and they all go off on Parker v. Levy's language about the military being a separate society unto itself internally requiring for matters of discipline and base morale a separate standard. 
    This statute--

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg

    This is not a military enclave case, this is more like Snepp.

    It looks for a substantial relationship, and that, I think, Craig v. Boren says that's what Reed says. 
    Schlesinger's important, really for the ways in which it differs from this case. 
    Every case, I think, in this Court that has ever cited Schlesinger, and has purported to follow Schlesinger, has emphasized that Schlesinger was a compensatory ameliatory act, that in fact it was uniquely so, because the very men who brought that action were the precise men who had benefited from the assignment differential, which means access to promotion differential, and so that case really is perhaps the archetype of compensatory--

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    --Like Kahn and Shevin. 
    It is usually cited seriatim to Kahn and Shevin. 
    The other thing is, of course, Schlesinger was an internal military case, and most importantly, as far as I can see, differentiating it between this case, other than the internal military matter, is that the basis of classification was not simply gender. 
    The explicit basis of classification was gender except where the access to the promotions was equal, at which point there was no differentiation. 
    This Court emphasized it, I think, at least three times in Schlesinger, that where men and women, for instance, in the Medical Corps or the Legal Corps... several other corps... had equal access to assignments geared to foster promotions, there was no difference in the time permitted to achieve promotion. 
    And that, I think, is very, very important. 
    The other thing is that historically Schlesinger was not based, even arguably, on stereotypes. 
    It was demonstrably based upon a recent congressional reconsideration in 1967, in fact, of precisely what was going on. 
    They found that there was still a gap in assignability, and there was still a gap, most particularly in how long it was taking men and women to achieve promotions. 
    And so Congress there did reenact, literally, as opposed to what happened here, major provisions of that entire series of statutes, so there really was congressional consideration there. 
    That's not the case here.

    But doesn't the burden shift as soon as the Government does... and you've conceded they've done here... show there's a difference in military need based on sex?

speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3584.198" stopTime="3732.664">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    --Your Honor, that would affect registration only if two different statutes were involved, one, a statutory prohibition on women participating in certain close combat activities, and the other, more importantly, a change in the Military Selective Service Act limiting the induction of people to people who will be assigned to those prohibited roles, because otherwise we are conflicting with history and Congress did not mean to conflict with history because we have always, as the testimony of General Tice and all the generals is clear, we have always drafted a very substantial, indeed, often a majority of draftees specifically for the noncombat areas. 
    And most importantly, the argument of flexibility was specifically refuted by General Abrams and other generals in the testimony because we are saying that there is a certain number of women that the military wants to have, welcomes, thinks is the optimal number for the defense of the country. 
    You cannot at the one point say that that is the military opinion and at the same time say that if those slots are filled with draftees rather than volunteers, we undermine flexibility. 
    The testimony of every Defense Department witness and every military witness was that all of those criteria, the reach-back, the flexibility, the rotation, the promotion rotations, the assignment rotation, were all taken fully into account when the military said, please let us register women, and let us decide whether they should be drafted, if and when the time for a draft comes. 
    General Abrams said that he didn't favor drafting women at the time because he didn't favor drafting men at the time. 
    They were in an all-volunteer mode, as he said, and that since present needs for both men and women were being met with volunteers, he didn't favor drafting anybody at that time. 
    Secretary Brown kept saying to Congress, let us register people now; and then, when we see what the need is, we can draft them. 
    This was what we came within a hair's-breadth of doing in World War II with respect to nurses. 
    I would only point that the utilization question is contrary to what the Government says. 
    For example, ministers are required--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3732.664" stopTime="3740.751">

    I would just ask if the case would be different in constitutional terms if the military had taken the position, we don't like women, we don't want any of them in the Army? 
    Would it be a different constitutional issue?

    --It would be a different matter of somehow meeting an evidentiary burden.

    Which they might have said in 1948, by the way.

    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    They didn't. 
    As a matter of Fact, General Eisenhower's statement to the Congress in 1948 was, if we ever have another war, we have got to draft women. 
    And that was based upon their performance even in the more limited numbers and roles that were used in World War II. 
    I would point out that--

    Mr. Weinberg, you have emphasized the testimony and I quite agree with you, if I were in your place I would, of some of the military men. 
    I think you can find conflicting statements if you read in all. 
    But what I wanted to ask you is this. 
    The Armed Services Committee of the United States Senate by a vote of twelve to five reached an entirely different result from the one that you reached, and they heard the testimony, not only this year but they've been hearing it for years. 
    Now, did the District Court reject specifically a single one of the 11 findings made by the Senate Armed Services Committee that were in turn approved by the conferees of both houses and in turn by both houses of Congress?
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3807.859" stopTime="3811.180">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    --Yes, I think the District Court specifically rejected a number of them.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3811.180" stopTime="3826.523">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    All eleven? 
    If so, do we accept the rejection by the District Court that tried a lawsuit that were contrary to the findings of the United States Congress?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3826.523" stopTime="3829.975">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We can read the testimony as well as the district judge could read it.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3829.975" stopTime="3832.776">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And if so what authority justifies us in doing that?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3832.776" stopTime="3838.330">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Perhaps the Kassel opinion handed down this morning.
speaker="donald_l_weinberg" startTime="3838.330" stopTime="3919.215">
    Mr. Donald L. Weinberg 
    I have not had the opportunity to read that. 
    The treatment of what happened in 1980 as congressional action was... the conference report said that there was no need to include women. 
    It did not find an affirmative need to exclude women: Again, Congress was dealing, I think, with the wrong question in that respect. 
    More importantly, perhaps, the activity of Congress in 1980 was not a reenactment or reconsideration of this situation. 
    The appropriations aspect of it, the House Joint Resolution, didn't even mention the word "registration". 
    It was a transfer of otherwise unobligated funds from the Air Force to Selective Service for the purpose of salaries and expenses. 
    I think Ex Parte Endo with its requirement for explicit mention of a particular expenditure rationale says that that would not suffice. 
    Now, with respect to S. 2294, the Authorizations Act, again--

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I think you're going beyond Justice Powell's question now. 
    Your time has expired, unless Justice Powell wishes to? 
    Yes, your time has expired. 
    The case is submitted, gentlemen. 
    Thank you very much.
