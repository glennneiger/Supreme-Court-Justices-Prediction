    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case No. 80-5060 is here by a reason of the grant of petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
    In this case, a Kentucky criminal trial judge refused a defendant's request to give the following instruction to the jury. 
    “The defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that he does not cannot be use as an inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in anyway.” 
    The Supreme Court of Kentucky found no error. 
    We granted certiorari to consider the petitioner's contention that a defendant upon request has a right to such an instruction under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. 
    For the reasons stated in detail in the Court's written opinion filed today, we have concluded that the petitioner is correct. 
    Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Kentucky for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's opinion. 
    Although, joining the opinion of the Court, Justice Powell and Justice Stevens have each filed concurring opinions and Justice Brennan has joined Justice Steven's concurrence. 
    Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
