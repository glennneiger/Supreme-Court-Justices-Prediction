    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The points that petitioner feels are presented to the Court on this petition for certiorari have to do with the question of whether a state court judge acting within the scope of his jurisdiction is a person as that term or word is used in Section 1983. 
    Petitioner submits that the resolution of that question depends in great part upon the scope of judicial immunity as that concept is applied by this Court.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Judicial immunity, Your Honor, Petitioner submits, is more than an affirmative defense.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="123.357" stopTime="127.387">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    You mean it has a little bit of jurisdiction on it?
speaker="finley_l_edmonds" startTime="127.387" stopTime="159.561">
    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Your Honor, in examining the development of judicial immunity, it seems that an argument can be made that it's in the rationale behind judicial immunity, the public interest to be served by judicial immunity. 
    That to put it in terms that is judicial immunity an affirmative defense raises the question what if the judge who sued doesn't raise the offense?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="159.561" stopTime="173.260">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, are you suggesting that it's comparable to, analogous to the posture of a United States Senator under the Speech or Debate Clause, that he may not be questioned in any other place?
speaker="finley_l_edmonds" startTime="173.260" stopTime="196.062">
    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    I'm saying, yes, that it's analogous to legislative immunity, congressional immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause if the judge, if the purpose for questioning the judge or for suing the judge is because of his act or conduct while a judge, acting within his jurisdiction.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="196.062" stopTime="201.092">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But we don't have a speech or debate clause typed for judges, do we?
speaker="finley_l_edmonds" startTime="201.092" stopTime="202.201">
    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="202.201" stopTime="206.417">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    That's a judicially constructive concept.
speaker="finley_l_edmonds" startTime="206.417" stopTime="282.246">
    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    It's a common law of construction; yes, Your Honor. 
    And if the scope of judicial immunity, just going back to Bradley v. Fisher and throw out the cases that have been cited by this Court: Pierson, Embler, more recently in the Consumer Union case. 
    The analysis of legislative immunity, the analysis of judicial immunity, that if the public interest or rationale behind this immunity is to free the judge from the intimidation, harassment, et cetera, as the Court has many times discussed in these cases. 
    If that is the rationale, then rhetorically does not the rationale require that judicial immunity apply regardless of whether the judge raises it as a defense? 
    So, in answer to your question, Judge Rehnquist, I would say that it's more than an affirmative defense, as would be a qualified immunity whereon a state officer or a federal officer is asserting that he is immune because of his good faith carrying out of discretionary functions.

    Your Honor, my response to that is does that not raise the question, or beg the issue, about the underlying rationale for the immunity?

    My client's position is that like the Barra v. Jackson case that involved the defendant who had sold property in violation of a restrictive covenant to folks of another race, the question was, could that defendant raise the constitutionality of that restrictive covenant as it had applied to the other race, assuming the defendant sold? 
    And this Court held, yes. 
    In Griswold v. Connecticut, there the physician had been convicted of the crime of an accessory and an accomplice to third parties having to do with the state's ban on contraceptives. 
    And this Court held that the physician had standing to raise the constitutionality argument that was more directly applicable to the third party... he's the person for whom the physician had treated.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Well, no, no. 
    I mention those because I think they're applicable. 
    I was thinking, I guess, of the question raised by the amicus, one of the amicus in the case, questioning our ability to raise the judge's immunity because we're not a judge. 
    We were sued by the plaintiffs for participating in a state judicial function and... well, our first point about the definition of person, the scope of judicial immunity, this to me logically turns in, goes into the question about was it congressional intent back in 1866 and again in 1871 and with subsequent amendments to the various civil rights acts, specifically this Act, 1983. 
    Is it congressional intent to superimpose federal court oversight or federal court jurisdiction over the litigation among parties of private rights in the state court authorities? 
    Here we don't have a case of Mr. Dennis and the other parties mugging the respondent on a highway. 
    What we've got here is, the other parties are not before the Court right now having gone to state court, having filed a suit in state court, a temporary injunction having been entered by Judge Carrillo, and that temporary injunction being dissolved in the ordinary course of events in the state proceedings by the Court of Appeals.

    To allow prosecution of a claim against a private citizen conspirator under... how is the private citizen even liable under 1983? 
    It's because of conspiracy with a judge under the Adickes v. Kress. 
    So we've got to have a conspiracy with the judge. 
    So the judge is involved, the judge's interest is involved because of the litigation against a private person. 
    The case is necessarily going to involve whether there was a conspiracy with this judge, even though he's immune, even though he can't be made to participate, even though he can't be made to testify.

    --Well, if we say that public interest requires that judges not be subjected to a pleading contest that can be brought about by any dissatisfied litigant in any state court action, that... to say that, okay, immunity means that you can't... that he's entitled to dismissal as a party and immunity means that you can't get--

    Justice White 
    Well then, immunity for these people isn't required, then, to implement any of the policies of giving judges immunity. 
    They can't be bothered for anything. 
    If they can't be called as witnesses, then why do you need to give their coconspirators immunity just to protect the judge, if the judge is already protected by... from being called as a witness or dragged through cases? 
    I thought your argument would be that if you didn't give these people immunity the judge could be called as a witness, and would be involved in this case... if you take him away from his judicial duties and have his motives questioned? 
    I thought so too. 
    It brought to my mind the controversy between Jefferson and Burr, when... and when John Marshall was sitting in the treason trial and tried to get Jefferson to appear as a witness. 
    And I think they settled it by Jefferson simply furnishing papers, and Jefferson's response was if the President could be subpoenaed from one court to another, he can be prevented from doing his presidential business. 
    But if you say he can't... that the judge can't even be subpoenaed to testify, it seems to me there's no reason in the policy that Justice White has mentioned, to say that the coconspirators share his immunity. 
    Between the Burr case and one more recent case, the Courts have held that even the President must respond and be a witness if necessary.

 If they can't be called as witnesses, then why do you need to give their coconspirators immunity just to protect the judge, if the judge is already protected by... from being called as a witness or dragged through cases? 
 I thought your argument would be that if you didn't give these people immunity the judge could be called as a witness, and would be involved in this case... if you take him away from his judicial duties and have his motives questioned? 
 I thought so too. 
 It brought to my mind the controversy between Jefferson and Burr, when... and when John Marshall was sitting in the treason trial and tried to get Jefferson to appear as a witness. 
 And I think they settled it by Jefferson simply furnishing papers, and Jefferson's response was if the President could be subpoenaed from one court to another, he can be prevented from doing his presidential business. 
 But if you say he can't... that the judge can't even be subpoenaed to testify, it seems to me there's no reason in the policy that Justice White has mentioned, to say that the coconspirators share his immunity. 
 Between the Burr case and one more recent case, the Courts have held that even the President must respond and be a witness if necessary.

    There is a damage remedy, and that remedy is being pursued by the Respondent in the form of a wrongful injunction suit. 
    Under Texas law, the dissolution of an injunction creates the cause of action for the wrongful injunction. 
    But in that case, the motives of the judge, in entering the injunction, is not a critical or a turning factor. 
    But here, we're talking about how do you get to the private under 1983? 
    You get to him only because of a conspiracy with the state actor; in this case it's a judge.

   Argument of Garland F. Smith
speaker="garland_f_smith" startTime="1291.953" stopTime="1424.383">
    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the question, I think, is pretty before the Court. 
    The question is whether or not the private individuals who do conspire with a state judge and do cause the state judge to enter the bench and enter unlawful orders that result in damage to the claim... do they automatically derive immunity for their wrongdoing simply because the judge is, himself, immune? 
    Now, this case, of course, is before Your Honors as... on the pleadings, on a motion to dismiss, and the pleadings, of course, have to be taken as true. 
    But we would point out to the Court that there's nothing in these pleadings, in this case, that has not already been adjudicated in the state of Texas. 
    The bribery was adjudicated, on a motion to disqualify Judge Carrillo. 
    The comments of the judge, after both parties had rested is included and attached to our pleadings, which is in the Appendix. 
    And the Order that the judge entered, holding that the judge was disqualified because the transactions between the judge and Mr. Manges amounted to a disqualifying situation... that's been decided. 
    Now, Judge Carrillo has, subsequently, been impeached by the Texas legislature. 
    The House included the transactions involved in the disqualification matter as one of the articles of impeachment... there were 12 articles, but this is only one of them. 
    He was convicted by the Texas Senate and removed from office for corruption, various items. 
    He was later tried and convicted in federal court for tax fraud. 
    Thereafter, he was tried and convicted in the Texas state courts for theft. 
    Now we are not here on a jailhouse-type pleading that's accusing an honorable judge and trying to besmirch the character of an honorable judge who simply made an error in one of his rulings.

 Of course, one of the reasons for the immunity doctrine is that it's awfully hard to separate out, you know, before you go to trial and appeal, and so forth, the honorable judge who made a mistake in his ruling and the corrupt judge who's been jailed for theft.

    He said that if you could determine that, then it would be monstrous not to allow relief.

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    --Oh yes. 
    It was made then. 
    Now, at the time the wrongful injunction was issued, the attorneys who represented the Respondents in that case... which was not our firm... the attorneys who represented the Respondents in that case did not know of the bribery. 
    The bribery itself was not determined until May the 20th, 1973. 
    But the judge who made the determination said that because of the bribery, the judge was disqualified as of February 1, 1971. 
    Now, the wrongful injunction came after that date, so the wrongful injunction came after the judge had accepted the bribe and after he was disqualified because of it.

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I think... I don't think that is exactly parallel. 
    The Congressional immunity is based on a specific constitutional provision. 
    The judicial immunity is based on common law. 
    And the... the exception being--

    You could concede the former arguendo, and still--

speaker="garland_f_smith" startTime="1559.315" stopTime="1608.765">
    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    --I would say it's irrelevant to our position. 
    The Civil Rights Act, in dealing with this matter, they did not specifically make an exception. 
    But in approaching our problem, we have to start with the Civil Rights Act. 
    And that of course does not make an exception even of the judge. 
    But the Court, in construing that statute, concluded that the Congress did not intend to abolish the common law immunities that existed at that time, and the immunities did exist for judges. 
    But no immunity existed for those who conspire with judges, under common law. 
    So therefore, the rationale that supports the immunity for the judges does not in any way give any immunity whatever--

    Now independence is only the means... now, it's an important means; if the judge is not independent he possibly cannot be entirely fair and impartial and free in his decisions. 
    But if he uses his independence as a means of aiding corruption as happened in this case, then to say that you exalt the independence of the judge over and above and make it more important than integrity, then you are reversing the whole application.

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    Now I think the Seventh Circuit, in the McFarland case, probably has laid the groundwork for the proper rule to take care of that. 
    You're going to have frivolous lawsuits unless you have rules of procedure that can take care of them. 
    Now that question, really, is not reached in this case. 
    I think you're going to have to have some stringent rules on a case of this kind, and the Seventh Circuit has said so. 
    And we have pled our case, specifically, and in great particularity, so that it would satisfy the stringent requirements that are made by the Seventh Circuit and we don't argue with that. 
    We think they ought to have those stringent requirements. 
    I don't think anybody ought to just be able to sit down and think up a bunch of charges to make against a judge, and file suit. 
    I think that--

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    No, we... now, let me answer that question. 
    In the first place, they say that the judge is not a person so far as 1983 is concerned. 
    Well of course that's a fiction, he is a person. 
    He may be an immune person but he's a person. 
    And the fact that he is immune does not have anything to do with his capacity to conspire; he has full capacity to conspire, he has full capacity to commit any criminal act that any individual has. 
    And so he's... the idea that he's not a person is just, it's just a fiction, not even valid legal fiction. 
    But now, when you get past that, he has conspired and by virtue of his conspiracy, our clients have been denied their right to try their case before a fair and impartial judge because the case was tried before a bribed judge. 
    Now that's not what the constitution guarantees. 
    We're not here arguing with the idea of an independent judiciary... we're here because we didn't get a fair and impartial judge, to begin with.

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    --I have had numerous Law Review articles and I have seen the quotation in cases and in briefs and so forth, that there was no derivative immunity at common law. 
    Now, I can't cite you a case that says... that specifically says that... that was a British case, as of the date of... 1983. 
    Now the next thing is, that any such immunity that is awarded to the private individuals who conspire with the judge, constitutes an invitation to corruption. 
    That's just engraved into the idea; that if you are going to allow a man to become immune from liability if he can bribe a judge and make him party to the scheme, he automatically gets immune for his act. 
    To pose that question is almost to answer it, I think.

speaker="garland_f_smith" startTime="2597.073" stopTime="2664.998">
    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    Well the rationale there is substantially what Mr. Edmonds said; that the fact that... we'll take, simplify it, we've got two parties; the judge and one party, so the one party who bribes the judge finds out that the judge is immune and then you file your conspiracy suit on 1983 and you cannot have a conspiracy with only one party. 
    So with the judge removed, they say, well, he didn't conspire with any state official against whom we could allege a cause of action. 
    Well, of course, that's a fiction, he conspired with him, and as in this case, the injunction was issued as a result of the bribe. 
    It lasted for 31 months, our client abated... he abated because it had the force of state law, it was state action, it had the color of state law, everything that was required was there. 
    And he abated for 31 months. 
    And the trial that he had was before a judge that was bribed. 
    Now, that doesn't meet the standard that the constitution guarantees.

    Well, the rationale was that because it takes two to conspire, when you remove the state, the immune state officer, you just have one left; therefore, there was no conspiracy because you can't conspire with yourself.

    So I think you can allow a suit under 1983 when it's meritorious, and if you follow the pleadings requirements of the Seventh Circuit, you are going to almost be sure that it's meritorious before it... before you get very far... certainly before you get to the discovery, anyway.

    Mr. Garland F. Smith 
    He has authority to enter an injunction. 
    I think the appellate court drew that he abused his discretion They... this particular injunction because it wasn't pled for, number one, and they could have him... the suit asked for an injunction against pollution. 
    They alleged that they were operating the wells in a manner to pollute the surface of the land, but the surface of the land in this case wasn't owned by the Petitioner. 
    But, the injunction could have enjoined pollution, but under Texas law there is no way they could have enjoined him from the lawful operation of producing oil. 
    They could have enjoined him from pollution but not from operating the property, and that's where it was fatally defective and that's why the appellate courts ruled that it was an abuse of discretion that he entered it and of course he entered it without taking any evidence to speak of, it was practically on the pleadings. 
    But those were in the case, that's really not too much involved here, but that's what the background is. 
    But anyway, in the extension of immunity to private parties is simply not necessary to preserving the integrity of the judiciary as I see it. 
    And that's what the courts have observed that have taken our position in the case. 
    Now, the courts that have taken an opposite position has, it's been notice, talked about these frivolous lawsuits. 
    Now, we don't deny that frivolous lawsuits are going to be filed. 
    They're going to be filed whether or not you allow a suit from, you have a meritorious lawsuit. 
    But we think the meritorious should be allowed certainly. 
    If you're going to hear all these frivolous cases. 
    Now, and as observed by the 5th Circuit, there's very little inconvenience to the judge and it's relatively insignificant when you compare it with the benefits to be derived by allowing suits under general immunity. 
    Now, with respect to a state court case, there is a case pending. 
    I think I should explain that since it has been mentioned. 
    When this case was filed, Judge Carrillo was still sitting as judge of the court in Bigelow County. 
    As it was proceeding, we realized we had a more serious question here on this matter of judicial immunity that we thought when we started out. 
    Frankly, my mind at the beginning just couldn't conceive of a holding that a judge could accept a bribe and he not be immune, and certainly that he would confer that immunity to other parties. 
    I didn't grasp that.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Yes, Your Honor, if I may take a few minutes to respond to several matters that have been raised. 
    Mr. Smith makes the statement in his argument that his client is left out in the cold. 
    Again, I think this consideration is critical when we talk about the rationale for this statute, the rationale of Congress in implementing this and passing this statute to implement the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Judge Carrillo did enter this injunction but that injunction in the course of the procedures and the substantive law that exists in the State of Texas, that injunction was set aside by a Texas court. 
    Sparks and Lynd, Mr. Smith's clients, did not have to go to a federal court to get the Texas courts to do right. 
    The Texas courts resolved the question. 
    He was not left out in the cold. 
    Secondly, they were not left out in the cold because they have pending a lawsuit in a Texas court under Texas law for the wrongful injunction.

 Well, what if the plaintiffs in a lawsuit file the lawsuit against your clients and they claim the immunity and your clients come in and claim immunity, based on the immunity of a state judge? 
 And the answer of the plaintiffs is, we stipulate that we'll never bother that judge, we'll never call him as a witness, he'll never be a witness against any of you, we'll not bother him at all. 
 But we'd have to admit that in the course of our lawsuit we're going to try to prove that he was corrupt. 
 Now, would you think your claim of immunity would be satisfied by, on any stipulation like that?

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Your statement, that in the course of these proceedings we're going to prove that there was a conspiracy for this judge to do wrong. 
    That's the very essence of judicial immunity, the very essence of it. 
    And my man is raising that immunity, not because he's a judge but because of this Court's decision in Pierson v. Ray that judicial immunity is applicable in 1983 despite the fact that there's nothing said in that statute about judicial immunity or any immunity.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    To use Mr. Smith's term, I guess that would be a fiction that we'd be dealing with, Your Honor. 
    I don't think that the purpose of immunity is to create a fiction. 
    I think the purpose of this immunity that goes back to the King's Bench, hundreds of years ago, is that there was presumption that it does exist. 
    And if we wanted to find that what if we get into a situation where the majority of judges are corrupt?

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    That's right, that's right. 
    And I have to submit to the court that this isn't as easy a question to answer as Mr. Smith's events. 
    We're not trying to say that there's a black and white side to this.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Even with the explicit, very explicit immunity and protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, a member of Congress can be sued under 1983 or in many other ways, and that doesn't stop that exposure.

    Yes but he isn't immune from having someone file a complaint with a lot of scurrilous allegations.
speaker="finley_l_edmonds" startTime="3502.020" stopTime="3562.558">
    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's right. 
    If we're not talking here about, should the scope of judicial immunity be broad enough to somehow screen out lawsuits as they're being filed as the Clerk's house, I guess the answer there is to respond upon, depend upon responsible journalism that they don't blow a lawsuit like that out of proportion when it's filed, before it's adjudicated. 
    Under the respondent's view of 1983 and the ability to pursue conspirators, these private citizens, I submit that, to follow respondent's view of the case, that the respondent could have gone to federal court immediately at the time that Judge Carrillo entered the temporary injunction even before The Beaumont Court of Appeals in Texas had a chance to throw it out. 
    Mr. Smith is fortunate in that he can present to the Court such a bad set of facts.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    Well, maybe I didn't state myself clearly. 
    What I was stating, that under the respondent's view of the case, that that just after the trial court stage that he would be would entitled under Section 1983 to file a suit for damages in federal court, despite what might happen in state court.

    Justice Marshall 
    What you say is that in any court action that has more than one defendant and one of the defendants is an immune judge, all of the others are equally immune.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    --If it has more than person involved and one of the people is a judge, all of the others... one, two, or 37... are all immune.

    Mr. Finley L. Edmonds 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    As far as the fiction concerning whether a judge, given this Court's decisions, that judicial immunity is applicable in 1983 cases, to say that, trying to say that a judge is or isn't a person is fiction, that... one could almost say that judicial immunity itself is a fiction when it comes to applying that to 1983. 
    I will submit that it was not the Congress's intent to litigate in federal court all states' courts' civil proceedings.
