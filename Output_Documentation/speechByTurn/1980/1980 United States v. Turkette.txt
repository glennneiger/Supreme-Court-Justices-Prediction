    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    Respondent was convicted by a jury on eight counts of substantive drug and mail fraud offenses and on one count of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
    In brief, the evidence at trial, the sufficiency of which was not challenged, showed the Respondent organized and headed a criminal association that engaged in a continuing course of illegal activities for profit. 
    The Turkette group was in existence for more than a two year period and was involved in numerous offenses, including the theft and distribution of drugs, the commission and facilitation of mail fraud by arson and other means, and the bribery of police officers and witnesses to protect these illegal activities. 
    The group operated in a highly structured and sophisticated manner, in which different individuals performed specific assigned roles to further the group's venture. 
    The questions presented by our petition are whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act excludes wholly illegitimate enterprises like Respondent's from the scope of its coverage, and if so, whether automatic reversal of Respondent's otherwise valid, non RICO convictions required on grounds of misjoinder.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I think that's correct. 
    And the Court below stands alone in reaching that anomalous result.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="155.883" stopTime="164.022">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Or was it that they were so well organized in their enterprise that--
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="164.022" stopTime="246.010">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I believe the holding of the Court below was that enterprises that are entirely and completely illegal are not within the scope of the principal anti racketeering statute in the federal criminal code. 
    That strikes us as an anomalous result, and every other Court of Appeals to consider the issue has concluded that RICO is not restricted to legitimate enterprises, but applies to illegitimate enterprises as well. 
    Nothing in the language of the statute distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. 
    On the contrary, the definition of enterprise states without qualification that enterprise includes any group of individuals associated in fact. 
    Similarly, the substantive provisions of RICO draw no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, but refer broadly to any enterprise. 
    And Congress specifically reinforced the sweep of the statute by providing that the provisions of RICO shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes. 
    In addition, despite the existence of an extensive definitional section for the key terms used in RICO, the statute offers no guidance whatever for defining the words legitimate and illegitimate the Respondent and amici seek to insert into the statute.

speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="271.827" stopTime="295.443">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    --I don't think one knows with certainty, because the meaning of the terms legitimate and illegitimate are by no means self evident, and neither the statute nor the legislative history offer any guidance on the meaning of those terms. 
    Simply because Congress didn't have that concept in mind. 
    In your hypothetical, for example, as I understand it, it's impossible to know what are the salient considerations or the proportion of legal and illegal activities--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="295.443" stopTime="299.328">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    You think that's irrelevant? 
    What the proportion is?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="299.328" stopTime="321.291">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    --We do, because we think both "legitimate" and "illegitimate" are within the statute. 
    And we think that the introduction of such an indefinite term as legitimate enterprise would complicate and protract RICO trials, and would lead to distinctions according to degree of legitimacy that are entirely unrelated to Congress' purpose to eradicate organized crime.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    We believe it is without merit; that there is nothing that makes the provisions redundant or internally inconsistent. 
    There is still the requirement that there be an enterprise or an entity and there is still the requirement that there be certain criminal acts. 
    It may well be true, and this may have been what the Court of Appeals had in mind, that the government's proof in a particular case will be much the same to show the pattern element of the offense and to show the enterprise element of the offense; the fact that people commit a series of offenses together may be a grounds for the jury to infer that they had joined together to form an association in fact that would satisfy the requirement of an enterprise. 
    But the fact that the government's proof may be the same on those two issues does not make them any less separate and distinct issues.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I think that's absolutely correct, and I think that's... certainly incongruous to think that Congress in passing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act didn't mean to take into account the Cosa Nostra or the Mafia in the prohibitions of the Act. 
    The reading of RICO I've just suggested to encompass illegitimate as well as legitimate enterprises, is fully consistent with and supported by the legislative history of the statute and the statute's purpose. 
    The legislative history nowhere indicates that Congress intended to limit the statute exclusively to the infiltration and corruption of organized or legitimate businesses... and to exclude racketeering activities pertaining to thoroughly unlawful operations as Respondent and amici urge. 
    Indeed, we can conceive of no reason and the Respondent and amici have offered none, why Congress would have wished entirely illegal businesses to be immune from the provisions of RICO.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    --Well I think it had in mind those things, but it didn't by any means limit itself to that. 
    And the statute, if I may point out, does not require that the defendant need be a member of an organized crime or organized, criminal activity, much as in Culbert, the Court held that the Hobbs Act was not limited in that way. 
    The statutory statement of findings in the legislative history of RICO plainly revealed Congress' awareness of and concern over organized crime's wholly illegal activities, and nothing suggests that Congress intended these activities to be left outside the scope of the statute by confining the term enterprise to legitimate enterprises. 
    Moreover on several occasions, Congress indicated that RICO would apply to illegitimate enterprises. 
    For example, in the Senate Report, in discussing the civil provisions of RICO, Congress referred to state cases in which civil remedies had been used against illegal gambling and prostitution businesses. 
    Similarly, Senator McClellan, the principal sponsor of the legislation, explained that RICO would apply to the counterfeit phonograph record business, to the illicit prescription drug industry and to stolen and counterfeit credit card schemes, all those being wholly illegal operations. 
    In the same vein, Congressman Poff, the sponsor of the bill in the House observed that truck hijacking operations would be subject to RICO; again an indication that Congress understood the breadth of the provisions it enacted. 
    Congress also recognized that illegal activities constitute the economic foundation of organized crime and provide the money and power used to used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate businesses, labor unions and government offices. 
    Thus even if the sole purpose of the statute were to prevent the infiltration of legitimate organizations, that purpose would be well served by applying RICO to entirely illegal ventures in order to eliminate the economic base of organized crime--

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I don't believe our case would since it involved a group of individuals and more than 50 drug store burglaries, for example, and by no means the single individual or a sporadic and isolated pattern of crime. 
    The Court of Appeals was also concerned with respect to the redundancy of the statute about applying the criminal provisions of Sections 1962(a) and (b) and the civil provisions of Section 1964 to illegitimate enterprises. 
    We have discussed that in the brief, and we don't think there is any inconsistency or redundancy in applying the statute that way, and indeed the application of those provisions could well serve Congress' purpose to eradicate organized crime by enabling the government to prosecute a defendant who used racketeering income, for example, to establish an illegal narcotics business or who, in the words of amici, muscled into an existing illegal operation. 
    Similarly in the civil provisions, we think that the Congressional intent would be fully effectuated if any person injured by a violation of the statute, including an illegitimate enterprise, would be able to seek compensation under Section 1964(c) from the wrongdoer for the injury he suffered to his business or property. 
    I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of John E. Wall, Jr.
speaker="john_e_wall_jr" startTime="1546.110" stopTime="1659.484">
    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the opportunity for this Court to reaffirm its decision in Kotteakos, and repair the damage done to that decision and to rule 8, by such circuit court decisions as Elliott. 
    And I'd like to mention, in that regard, what RICO does not do and was not intended by Congress to do. 
    The RICO statute neither by its terms nor in its legislative history, ever did purport to allow a single prosecution of a defendant for all his disparate and unrelated and otherwise non joinable crimes. 
    Also, in enacting RICO, Congress did not intend to extend vicarious liability beyond the limits of traditional conspiracy law to permit mass trials. 
    What RICO does do and what it was intended to do, I suggest, by Congress, was to protect the integrity of interstate businesses by 1962, thus 1962(a) prohibits people with dirty money from buying into the businesses. 
    1962(b) prevents the takeover of interstate businesses through criminal activity such as extortion and whatnot. 
    And (c) prevents the corruption or spoiling of legitimate businesses when one of its employees or associates goes bad.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    What I say, Mr. Chief Justice, is what RICO was designed to do was to be used like a scalpel, rather than a meat cleaver. 
    RICO was an integrated statute in itself, part of an integrated whole, the Organized Crime Act. 
    True, the Organized Crime Act was designed to eradicate organized crime.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    --No sir, not under, the definition, and under the precise restricted purpose that Congress had in enacting this one section. 
    And I can perhaps best underline that, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, if we think of the enterprise that we're protecting as the victim, not the criminal, at the heart of the split in the circuit is the distinction between the enterprise as victim and enterprise as criminal. 
    Only the First and Eighth Circuits have squarely and correctly looked at the statute as a whole in the symmetry of the RICO title together within the larger symmetry of the Organized Crime Act, and made it clear that Congress' purpose was to treat the enterprise as a victim. 
    And this satisfies the plain meaning, so called plain meaning rule; look at the statute as a whole and to make every element within the statute have significance and not be redundant, we consider--

 And I don't understand why your distinction between victim and criminal helps us at all in our analysis, because it seems to me you can have an illegal enterprise, that would also be a victim of a takeover by a larger illegal enterprise.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    Well, the reason that analogy is helpful is that if we follow the Elliott definition and say that all illegal enterprises are included, then we have no cohesive thought to apply the conspiracy concept to. 
    According to Elliott, the essential nature of the plan was to associate for the purpose of making money. 
    And rather than the wheels and the chains, we have an amoeba like infrastructure that controls the secret criminal network. 
    Until Elliott, defining RICO to include so called illegal enterprises, that is, to include an individual who does two separate crimes that come under the definition of criminal racketeering, or a group of individuals who do strictly illegal activities,... excuse me, I lost my train of thought.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    --One part liberal to the definition as to who is an enterprise, who is a legal enterprise, because as somewhere in the legislative history was mentioned, organized crime may form all kinds of different ways to get around this. 
    Well that's precisely why the broad term of enterprise is applied, when you are construing it to protect the victim. 
    When it comes to the criminal, the actor, rather than the one or the individual or the enterprise acted upon, the Rule of Lenity applies. 
    And by adopting our understanding of the statute, you are protecting the Rule of Lenity regarding the penal provisions.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    I am, Your Honor, Mr. Justice. 
    In this regard, that I'm applying the broad construction to the remedial purpose of protecting the legitimate enterprise which we define broadly. 
    But when it comes to the Rule of Lenity, when that's applied to a wrongdoer, the criminal, the one acting rather than the one acted upon, no. 
    And by the approach that we take, you protect the Rule of Lenity, and you avoid the due process implications mentioned in Dunn v. the United States, where Mr. Justice Marshall said, writing for the majority of this Court, as a matter of fact for the unanimous court, this practice, that is the Rule of Lenity, is not merely a convenient maxim of statutory construction, rather, it is rooted in fundamental principles of due process. 
    Related to that argument, and particularly related to what we consider probably the most important case to be considered in this matter, is that Dunn's observation... or, rather Dunn, Dunn has significance with regard to the Justice Department's observation is, well, theoretically, this thing may be overbroad, but trust our discretion to apply it properly. 
    I suggest to you there are two problems with that. 
    One, the Justice Department, instead of Congress, then defines the crime. 
    A bigger problem, as pointed out by Dunn and relevant in this case too, is it defines the crime differently when it signs the indictments than it does at the legislative hearings. 
    In Dunn, that precise point was brought out by the Court. 
    In our view, the Justice Department's contemporaneous rather than current interpretation offers the more plausible reading of the subcommittee's intent. 
    At the legislative hearings on RICO, the Attorney General, the chief of the criminal division, everybody, said that the purpose of RICO... again, applying the scalpel as part of an overall plan, is to cut out the cancer of racketeering activity on legitimate interstate businesses.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    --It is probably... well, I suggest, it may... it is, the Organized Crime Control Act is a very broad net. 
    However, Congress did not set up RICO to get all possible criminal activity, and they did not intend this body of lawyers as Mr. Justice Rehnquist said in Alvarez, this body of lawyers did not intend, when they passed RICO, to change the rules of conspiracy, to change Kotteakos, and to change the rules of Joinder. 
    And if they did intend to do it, which they didn't, but if they tried to, I suggest it would be unconstitutional and this Court would have much to say about that. 
    Members of the Court, it has been suggested that even if this Court does agree with our view of the scope of RICO, that my client should nevertheless have the First Circuit reversal, the change, because there was harmless error. 
    And our argument is, of course, that there was not harmless error, that he was joined with other defendants he should not have been, and that he was joined in a number of criminal charges against him, that without the RICO expansion of conspiracy vehicle he could never have been tried together for.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    I suggest finally to this Court, that the principles of severance enunciated in McElroy and the language in Kotteakos which supports it, suggests that he was damaged by going to trial in all these cases. 
    For instance, Vargas was found not guilty by the jury on three of the mail fraud counts. 
    Another defendant was found not guilty of bribery in the police bribing count. 
    I'm suggesting that to have gone to trial with all these crimes confounds the defendant. 
    I'm suggesting he may well have had a good defense, say, to one or more of the arson or bribery counts, and might have wanted to testify but was not able to because of the drug charge.

    Mr. John E. Wall, Jr. 
    Except for this: I suggest the intimation is, and the fact is, that in these circumstances there's certain error that is not harmless and never can be with this illegal theory, never can be harmless. 
    And if I might take a moment just to remind all of us that in Kotteakos, the Court of Appeals had said that there was no prejudice, especially since guilt was manifest and to reverse the conviction would be a miscarriage of justice. 
    But this Court, speaking in Kotteakos, said technical, my foot, they said, what may be technical for one is substantial for another. 
    What minor and unimportant in one setting, crucial in another. 
    Moreover, lawyers know if others do not, that what may seem technical may embody a great tradition of justice or a necessity for drawing lines somewhere between great areas of law, that in other words, one cannot always segregate the technique from the substance, or the form from the reality. 
    I'm suggesting also, members of this Court, that in your decision in Dunn that living, wonderful principle of our law was again upheld where the Court of Appeals in the Tenth Circuit said, it's obvious there was a variant, sure, but the guy lied under oath, even if it was in the lawyer's office, so let the conviction stand. 
    Oh no, this Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice... or rather, I'm sorry, by Mr. Justice Marshall, stated: the jury well... may well have reached the same verdict had the prosecution built its case properly. 
    But the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a Defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial. 
    I suggest to the Court that in conjunction with the principles enunciated in Kotteakos, and in Dunn, and in McElroy and in King in the First Circuit, that the First Circuit decision should stand. 
    Thank you.

    Do you have anything further, Mr. Levy?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="3319.451" stopTime="3375.022">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I only have two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First, Mr. Wall has argued that under the statute, the enterprise must be the victim rather than the means of the commission of the pattern of racketeering activity. 
    Nothing in the statute suggests or requires that, and indeed the fallacy may be shown by the Ninth Circuit's decision in the Zemek case cited in our reply brief, where the owner of a tavern advanced his tavern business through extortion and murder of his competitors. 
    In that case, the enterprise was a tavern and that was advanced rather than being the victim of the racketeering activity. 
    Second, in this case, there were legitimate businesses that were harmed by Respondent's conduct. 
    Particularly the drugstores that were burglarized and the insurance companies that were defrauded were clearly harmed and that illustrates how the application of RICO to an entirely illegitimate enterprise can serve to protect legitimate businesses from the ill effects of racketeering. 
    Thank you.
