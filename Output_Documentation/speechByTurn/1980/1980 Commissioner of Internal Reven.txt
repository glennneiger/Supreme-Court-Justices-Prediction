    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This is a case involving a rather technical question of federal taxation. 
    It comes to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    Respondent is an integrated miner and manufacturer of cement with a mining plants in Utah. 
    The question presented involves the applicability of an equation. 
    One used to determine the proper depletion, deduction allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    We were asked to decide which of respondent's products in the combined mining, manufacturing operations was the first marketable product for purposes of the equation. 
    There is a flat conflict among the circuits on this question. 
    As an oral summary of our opinion in this tax case would highly be enlightening. 
    I will simply say that for the reasons stated at some length in the opinion filed this morning, we agree anonymously with the Commission of Internal Revenue and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
