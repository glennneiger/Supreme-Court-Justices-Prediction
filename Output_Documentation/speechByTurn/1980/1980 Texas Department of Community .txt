    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The first of these is 79-1764, Texas Department of Commissioner of Affairs against Burdine. 
    This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    It involves a proper evidentiary burden borne by an employer in a discrimination suit brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    The Court of Appeals held that when a discharged employee proves a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer then must prove by preponderance of the evidence that nondiscriminatory reasons existed. 
    The Court further held that the employer also must prove that the person retained in the position at issue was better qualified than the rejected employee. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to the appropriate burden of proof to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination. 
    Our prior cases have held that the employerâ€™s burden is to identify clearly by evidence a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision. 
    This is merely a burden of going forward with the evidence, the overall burden of persuasion remands throughout the case with the plaintiff employee. 
    We think the Court of Appeals misunderstood our prior decisions and imposed an inappropriate burden of proof on the employer in this case. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for the application of the correct legal standard.
