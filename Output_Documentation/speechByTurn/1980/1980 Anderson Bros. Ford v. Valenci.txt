    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Anderson Bros. v. Valencia. 
    Mr. Kramer, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on certiorari from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and it poses two broad issues. 
    The first of which is whether the entire credit industry, whose stock in trade is security interests failed to recognize and disclose a security interest required to be disclosed under the Truth-in-Lending Act. 
    Secondly, this case poses the question of whether even if such a hard to imagine mistake occurred, the ends of justice are served by applying any such decision retroactively to any case other than the one at bar.

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    --There are... we have no number as to the precise number of cases which have raised this issue. 
    There have been, however, 27 decisions of various circuit and district courts on this issue in 15 different cases that have already reached the courts. 
    Certainly whatever the decision of this Court is on this issue will be the landmark case in this area. 
    And depending on what this Court holds--

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    --No there is not, Your Honor. 
    These actions may be brought in either the federal courts or the state courts. 
    But most jurisdictions have state laws which provide that even time barred counter-claims for contracts entered into for more than a year prior to the date on which the action was filed can be brought as counter-claims and are revived. 
    So that any defaulting creditor, rather, any defaulting debtor who is sued by a creditor to collect a deficiency judgment on an amount owed on a car who may have entered into his contract four or five years ago could bring a $1000 plus attorneys fees counter-claim, or action for recoupment under most jurisdictions and that would be greater, in most cases, than the deficiencies in these cases. 
    Now the Respondents in this case estimate that Ford Motor Credit Company alone repossesses 10,000 cars per year. 
    The industry of course, repossesses and has to bring deficiency actions in a far greater number of cases. 
    The fact that this is the industries' form contract presents a very great problem for the industry. 
    The facts of this particular case are that the Respondents purchase and financed the purchase of a used car in 1977 from Anderson Bros. Ford. 
    Almost immediately they were disenchanted with their purchase because of mechanical difficulties and sought to rescind the transaction after unsuccessfully pursuing certain state consumer complaint remedies. 
    Those were unsuccessful, but they... the Respondents did file this Truth-in-Lending action, alleging five separate truth-in-lending violations in this form. 
    In an opinion rendered on October 31, 1978, the trial court dismissed entirely those truth-in-lending allegations. 
    In particular, it dismissed the allegation as to the claim that the assignment on the back of the contract which was an assignment of physical damage in unearned insurance premiums by the debtor to the creditor was a security interest, that was the allegation, and that was one of the five allegations which was entirely dismissed by the trial court. 
    As to this particular allegation that the assignment was a security interest that should have been not disclosed on the back but on the front of the contract under the Truth-in-Lending Act, but the District Court looked at the normal meaning of the term security interest in the Act, and looked at the usual and customary meaning of those words as used in the contract, and found that there was no security interest here in the assignment of unearned physical damage insurance premiums, appearing on the back of the contract. 
    And therefore, no requirement that that appear on the front of the contract. 
    Now, developments occurred in the Fifth Circuit where the Fifth Circuit rendered an opinion contrary to that which we called to the attention of the District Court and he reversed his position, eventually that reversal against finding the violation of the Truth-in-Lending Act as to this assignment clause was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit. 
    There are four uncontrovertible elements which stand as walls that surround the issues in this case, and we respectfully submit that the Court's decision will be made somewhere within the confines of those four walls. 
    They are: the true nature of the interest, the assignment interest that is before this Court; the purpose of the Act and the specific legislative history of adoption of the Act's security interest provision; the promulgation by the Federal Reserve Board staff in 1981, of... Federal Reserve Board Proposed Official Interpretation 173, which is precisely in point on this issue.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Kramer, I have some difficulty with the various levels of regulations and the weight we should give them. 
    The 1970 regulation, which doesn't seem to be mentioned in the 1981 promulgation, simply, at the end, says in the event of the customers default, your client would have the right to cancel the policy and apply any premium refund to the unpaid balance of the loan. 
    Under the circumstances, we think it would be appropriate to disclose the loan company's ownership of the policy as a type of interest under 12 C.F.R. Section so-and-so. 
    I had some trouble with that, originally, because it didn't seem to me to state flatly it must be disclosed, the words it is appropriate to disclose it simply said may be in an excess of caution... but I was also troubled by the fact that the 1981 promulgation, the new regulation which goes in exactly the opposite direction, didn't seem to refer to the 1970 regulation.
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="642.366" stopTime="711.776">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    Your Honor, I don't believe that they were exactly the same. 
    The 1970 unofficial interpretation issued by the Board staff does certainly use the word appropriate. 
    However, it involved a different kind of insurance than physical damage insurance on a vehicle, where the vehicle is the real security interest in the transaction. 
    And the only security interest which appears in the 1970 unofficial interpretation by the Board was the lender's security interest in the insurance itself, which he was financing; it is not at all the same as the transaction where the unearned insurance premiums on physical damage insurance are entirely incidental to the real security interest in the transaction as we have here, which is the financed vehicle, which is clearly disclosed on the front of the contract and it's disclosure would be clouded if there were such an incidental interest taken off of the back of the industries' form contract and put on the front, to confuse the issue of what security interest the consumer was giving up in the transaction.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="711.776" stopTime="719.799">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say they were different kinds of insurance, the 1970 letter referred to life insurance?

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    Accidental death and dismemberment policy where there was a single lifetime premium, Your Honor, and the only thing that the creditor was taking in that case was a security interest in the unearned premiums. 
    There was no other security interest in that transaction.

    Why hasn't the '81 proposal been finalized? 
    There just isn't time, or is it--
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="753.887" stopTime="876.684">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    No, Your Honor, it's very clear that it is out of deference for this Court's authority. 
    Clearly, the Federal Reserve Board under the Court's opinion in Milhollin had the authority to clear up this matter once and for all, and tell the credit community which is only looking for direction in such matters, and will follow that direction from a central authority... which Your Honors found in Milhollin was the Federal Reserve Board clearly, and its power was to enforce, apply and interpret the Act and the regulation. 
    That... what the Board has referred to as a deferral of final action, and not a withdrawal at all, came only after this Court granted certiorari in this case. 
    And in light of the fact that the 172 prior official staff interpretations of the Federal Reserve Board have been adopted without any substantive change, as we indicated in Appendix B to our reply brief, is a factor that the Court ought to consider, because these things were not promulgated as trial balloons, as counsel for the Respondents has argued, but rather as seriously well considered and thoroughly thought-through determinations by the Federal Reserve Board as to interpreting the Act that governs the framework of, in determining commerce and credit in the United States. 
    Indeed, although 173 is only a proposed agency interpretation, the Courts have held applying this Court's Skidmore v. Swift decision, that even a proposed agency interpretation is entitled to such persuasive weight as is evidenced from such things as the thoroughness of its consideration and the validity of its reasoning. 
    Petitioners submit--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="876.684" stopTime="900.034">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --I suppose that's true only with respect to agencies which are not empowered to, in effect, kind of fill in the blanks or make definitions and that sort of thing? 
    Skidmore v. Swift dealt with an agency which was not expressly authorized by Congress to interpret the Act--
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="900.034" stopTime="1042.959">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    --Yes, Your Honor, but the Federal Reserve Board, of course, is empowered to interpret the Act, just as the Securities and Exchange Commission is empowered to interpret the Securities laws. 
    And this Court's opinion in 1975, the Court held that even though the... in the Forman case, the securities law of 1934 refers to any stock... the Securities and Exchange Commission had the power to interpret that to exclude stock in a cooperative housing project as not being a security, even though the express words of the language of the statute that the agency was empowered to interpret did use the term any stock, the Respondents in this case, make an argument to the effect that the strict words of the statute should be followed in this case, or the strict words of the regulation, which indeed are not in point as to this type of assignment of an interest unearned premiums, but the Respondent's literal interpretation cuts the heart of the purpose and intent of the Act out of it, does not look at the purpose of the Act, which is to permit informed, comparison credit shopping as this Court held in the Milhollin decision. 
    And the Board's determination, after having thoroughly considered, in proposing 173, the 27 decisions in the conflicting district and circuit court cases on this matter, who had... the Board had, at the time they proposed 173, the benefit of intensive Congressional hearings on the simplification act, and its own ongoing revision of Regulation Z before it proposed 173, so that it is the position of the Petitioners given those factors which support the validity of the reasoning of 173, and the determination of the Federal Reserve Board particularly backed against the fact that none of the prior official staff interpretations of the Board which were proposed were changed in any way before they became final.

    It would not, as the Board has noted in 173, promote proper... the purposes of the act or proper comparison credit shopping--

    Putting it on the back makes it part of the contract; the issue in this case is whether it was required under the Truth-in-Lending Act to be disclosed on the front as a security interest, along with the vehicle which was the real security interest in this transaction.

    The first of which is, 173 was not available to the Seventh Circuit when it wrote its decision. 
    If Your Honor looks at footnote 24, I believe it is, in the Seventh Circuit's decision, it is obvious, and that footnote states,

speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="1534.404" stopTime="1569.244">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    --The requirement, Your Honor, would be with reference to disclosure statements under the Truth-in-Lending Act. 
    The regulation and the statute uses the term disclosure statement, and for purposes of the Act the front of the contract that's in Court is the disclosure statement. 
    A disclosure statement may be given as a separate document on... and not as the front of a contract... but in this case, the front of the contract is the disclosure statement.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1569.244" stopTime="1581.051">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So if you said... if you had just provided that the entire contract should be the disclosure statement, then what about that?
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="1581.051" stopTime="1674.994">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    That would not be permissible under the provisions which require that the disclosure statement be on one sheet of paper and I believe, on the front, exclusively. 
    In conclusion, we have argued in our brief and pointed out to the Court in our brief that the adoption of the original Truth-in-Lending Act, the Act that this case comes under, and its security interest provisions, came from the floor of Congress with the idea of preventing not... and not affecting the type of interest which is before the Court now, but what was referred to on the floor of Congress by Congressman Cahill and Senator Proxmire, as a vicious second mortgage racket that involved the taking of second mortgages on purchasers homes and borrowers homes, unwittingly given by such borrowers... that's what the security interest provision of the Act was adopted... to put in... that's how it came up from the floor of Congress. 
    The incidental interest which is before the Court at this time, there is no relationship whatsoever to what Congress had in mind when it originally adopted the Act, under the Truth-in-Lending Simplification Act, Chairman Volcker has said in the letter that is attached to our reply brief as an appendix, that this issue disappears under the new Act. 
    And it's very clear that this disclosure is not required under the new Act. 
    In conclusion, I would cite to the Court,--

    So that the security interest requirement is not limited to second mortgages?

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    It is limited... Congress' intent is limited to significant interests in property, and in knowledge on the part of buyers--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1708.500" stopTime="1712.202">

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Because your point is... there's a significant interest in the property, but your point is, it's not... the property is not significant, as I understand it?

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    That's correct. 
    As Judge Cudahy said, and he was joined in by Judge Swygert in his concurring opinion, that to require the disclosure of this particular assignment on the face of the contract would merely add virtually inconsequential information; lengthening, complicating and trivializing this disclosure for no apparent reason.

    --But you said earlier, I think you were interrupted, that only five words would have to be added to this phrase.
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="1748.792" stopTime="1758.667">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    That's Respondent's contention, and this Court rejected the contention in Milhollin with only two words having to be added to that contract, because it was not within the intent of Congress.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1758.667" stopTime="1767.188">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, that may be, but just as a matter of whether it's true or not, is it not true that by just adding the words "and insurance policies", or something like that, you would have an adequate disclosure?
speaker="aaron_j_kramer" startTime="1767.188" stopTime="1796.625">
    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    It could be done, Your Honor. 
    It is done on a new form of Ford Credit Contract, however, that form of contract gives up significant interest that is taken under this broader form. 
    For the reasons that we've stated in our briefs and that I've had a chance to reach in argument today, we ask that the Court reverse on the merits or at the minimum, because of the problems created with respect to this form contract, make any decision on this issue affirming prospective only.

    If there weren't any provision like that, no Court has construed the statute to require that.
speaker="alan_a_alop" startTime="1876.554" stopTime="1930.739">
    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    --That's correct. 
    The question in this case, whether a creditor's claim to returned insurance premiums has to be disclosed as a Truth-in-Lending Act security interest is disposed of by the fact that both the Act and Regulation Z require the disclosure of any security interest. 
    The use of the broad language "any security interest" reflects an unmistakable intention of Congress that every security interest retained by a creditor in the course of a credit transaction be disclosed. 
    This Court, in the cases of Shea v. Vialpando and Harrison v. PPG Industries has indicated that the use of the term "any" precludes limited or narrowed statutory construction. 
    The broad language in the statute, "any security interest", would also controvert... Ford Credit's suggestion, that only essential security interests need be disclosed.

    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    The point is that FC-0173 is an unadopted, mere proposal of the Federal Reserve Board that was issued with the caveat that it may be withdrawn or it may be altered after public comment was scrutinized. 
    Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has twice in writing specifically precluded any reliance on FC-0173 and it has deferred any final action on FC-0173 as a result of this Court's granting of certiorari in this case.

    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    If the Federal Reserve Board adopted FC-0173 because it uses the test of incidentalness which is at variance with the plain language of the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z, and because it is also at variance with longstanding Federal Reserve Board Regulations, or rather, the interpretation in Public Information Letter 377, it would still be entitled to little deference under the traditional test of Skidmore v.

    And if Regulation Z had come out saying that some security interests have to be on the face and it's enough to put some of them on the back, you wouldn't be here?
speaker="alan_a_alop" startTime="2266.474" stopTime="2353.878">
    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    --That's correct. 
    I would note that the Federal Reserve Board has issued a series of rulings which have required disclosure of a wide range of security interests, security interests which do not fit into Ford Credit's characterization of essential security interest. 
    The Federal Reserve Board, in their rulings set out at page 9 of our brief, have required disclosure of security interests in bank accounts, credit union accounts, and after acquired property. 
    The test is not whether the security interest is essential, but whether... but merely that any security interest be required to be disclosed. 
    The Regulation Z definition, as I indicated, is any interest in property which secures payment or performance of an obligation and thus a two-pronged test is set up by Regulation Z and every Court which has applied that test to the issue in this case has concluded that a creditor's claim to returned insurance premiums is a security interest under the Truth-in-Lending Act. 
    Although the first test, the first prong of the Regulation Z definition, is any interest in property, Ford Credit attempts to downplay the significance of the interest in property it has retained in this case. 
    It argues that this is an identical interest and therefore need not be disclosed. 
    However, a creditor's claim to returned insurance premiums is significant: to Ford Credit, it has meant more than 10 million dollars by virtue of that provision over the last 10 years by our estimate, an estimate Ford Credit has not disputed.

    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    Well in this case, for example, it involved the physical damage insurance premium that exceeded $200. 
    Given a cancellation of that insurance upon the default of the consumer, Ford Credit would have entitled to that $215 by virtue of its clause. 
    And in this case, it meant $215 to the consumer.

    --Well, this money would, if there is no deficiency, if there was a surplus, of course, it would go directly to the consumer... even, however, if this Court deemed that the interest in this case to be incidental, it would still be sufficient to meet the test of Regular Z's definition of security interest, which merely requires any interest in property. 
    The second prong of the Regulation Z test is an interest in property which secures payment or performance of an obligation. 
    The interest Ford Credit has retained in returned insurance premiums secures payment of this obligation because Paragraph 17 of Ford Credit's contract specifically authorizes Ford Credit to recover returned insurance premiums and to apply them towards the outstanding debt. 
    Thus, Ford Credit's interest in this returned insurance premium secures the payment of the obligation and both prongs of the Regulation Z test for security interest are met. 
    Contrary to the assertion of Ford Credit which was made today, the interest it retains in secured premiums would, if properly disclosed to consumers, be understood by consumers--

    No we do not, Your Honor. 
    Ford Credit also has argued that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2749.234" stopTime="2765.945">
    Justice Stevens 
    May I ask one other question as a matter of history, is it true that before this statute was passed it was customary for the finance companies to buy the insurance themselves, and then they would buy the policy and make the purchase pay the premiums?
speaker="alan_a_alop" startTime="2765.945" stopTime="2776.736">
    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    --The record doesn't reflect that, Your Honor, but I believe it is customary for both mechanics to exist.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2776.736" stopTime="2781.371">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And there's the provision in the contract here that permits the buyer to buy it elsewhere if he wants to.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2781.371" stopTime="2788.127">
    Justice Stevens 
    I mean, it used to be in the home mortgage business that the real estate brokers would make the money on the insurance.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2788.127" stopTime="2805.320">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I guess it's probably true in this industry as well, although I don't know. 
    And so, is this just sort of one of those things that grew out of the fact that buyer was given an option to buy his own insurance and therefore, the security interest was created in that policy? 
    Whereas, if the older practice had been followed, the dealer would have just owned the policy himself.
speaker="alan_a_alop" startTime="2805.320" stopTime="2862.442">
    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    --Well, in both situations of course, the dealer retains the security interest in returned insurance premiums. 
    Under both. 
    I don't think the historical analysis there would explain anything. 
    Ford Credit argued that this information would create an information overload. 
    Certainly when the matter is disclosed, as it is in the present contract, buried on the reverse side and clothed in the language of an assignment clause, in one sentence which is 58 words long, it is confusing. 
    However, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in the Gennuso decision indicated that a creditor's security interest in returned insurance premiums could be meaningfully disclosed to consumers in a matter of a few words and also importantly, intelligibly and meaningfully. 
    And we would note that Ford Credit's new contract which it has adopted subsequent to the decision below, does disclose this information to consumers on the front side of the contract--

    My point is however, that they have, they are now disclosing this information concisely in a matter of five words on the front side of the contract; that's hardly creating an information overload that they refer to. 
    I would also note that Ford Credit's reliance on the Truth-in-Lending Simplification and Reform Act is misplaced. 
    That Act is not effective until 1982, and... it is not retroactive, it is not made applicable to pending litigation or is it applicable... or made retroactively applicable, thus by it's own terms, the Simplification Act is not relevant to this case and by virtue of 1 United States Code Section 109, Ford Credit's liability for violations of the existing Truth-in-Lending Act is not extinguished by virtue of the enactment of the Simplification Act.

    --It would, Your Honor, because I believe it does change the law regarding the disclosure of security interests. 
    There's no question of that. 
    The point is that Ford Credit argues that we should look to the Simplification Act because it allegedly interprets the Truth-in-Lending Act, and we would note that there is nothing in the language of the Simplification Act or the Committee Reports which underlie the simplification Act, that interprets or construes the present Truth-in-Lending Act which governs this transaction. 
    The only thing Ford Credit has relied on, since there is nothing in the language of the Act or in the Committee Reports that underlie it, the only thing Ford Credit has relied on is a statement, an isolated statement of one senator... Senator Garn, to the effect, arguing that... excuse me, that the language... but Senator Garn, we would note, was not a member of the body that enacted the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Congress that enacted the Truth-in-Lending Act, and Senator Garn's statement is not reflected in the Committee Report; instead, it was inserted in the Congressional Record after the Committee Report was issued and it's not reflected in the Committee Report.

    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    That's correct. 
    However this Court in the past, has given little if any, weight to the post-passage remarks of legislators regarding the meaning of previously enacted legislation, particularly where the legislator was not a member of the enacting body. 
    Ford Credit has argued that the application of the decision in this case should be made prospective only, with regard... except as with regard to the Respondents in this case. 
    However, by placing the argument in this posture, by conceding that the Respondent should recover, regardless of the application of the decision as given, Ford Credit has destroyed any adversarial relationship between the parties on this issue. 
    That is, Ford Credit has presented no case or controversy to this Court on the issue of the application this decision is to be given. 
    Ford Credit on the issue of non-retroactivity, presents no case or controversy in that it seeks no relief that will affect the Respondents in any way, it seeks no alteration in the judgment below, and as a consequence, in essence it seeks an advisory opinion that will affect other litigation, pending litigation in which the Respondents have no interest.

    Mr. Alan A. Alop 
    As it is our opinion that the Court need not reach the issue of prospective application, we will stand on our briefs with regard to the Chevron analysis. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.

    Mr. Aaron J. Kramer 
    Thank you. 
    The purpose of the clause that we've been discussing today is not to gain access to incidental... unearned security interests, but rather to keep the real security interests in these transactions not only for Ford Credit but for the industry insured... and that is, to maintain insurance on the financed vehicles themselves which are the real security interests in the transaction. 
    We do not only rely upon Senator Garn who is a member of the committee that adopted the Simplification Act, but also the Federal Reserve Board that held that the Simplification Act clarifies this issue as intended by the original Act. 
    Finally, with respect to this matter, creditors are only looking for clear direction from the Federal Reserve Board which has stated that clear direction in 173, and but for this Court's grant of certiorari that would be the law today. 
    Respondent should not be permitted to embrace the Federal Reserve Board's decision while at the same time ignoring 173.
