Bullington v. Missouri
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="8.670">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear first this morning Bullington v. Missouri. 
    Mr. Sindel, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="8.670" stopTime="154.631">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In July of 1978 Robert Bullington filed a motion to quash the jury panel to be commenced against him under this Court's decision in Taylor v. Louisiana. 
    It was contended at that time that the statutes constructed in Jackson County violated those provisions in that case in that they excluded women unconstitutionally from the jury. 
    Five months later he proceeded to trial for his life, at which time the jury came back with a verdict of guilty, the guilt phase of the trial, and rendered a sentence of life imprisonment. 
    The question now before this Court is whether or not the State of Missouri can seize upon the opportunity to take the reversal of that decision of guilt pursuant to this Court's decision in Duren v. Missouri and resubject and resentence this individual to a trial for his life. 
    Throughout the proceedings counsel for the defendant and the defendant persisted in claiming that to proceed to trial with the jury panel so composed violated his constitutional rights. 
    The trial court, following the mandates of the Missouri Supreme Court, denied these motions. 
    He proceeded to the trial. 
    Subsequent to the trial his motion for a new trial was sustained and a new trial was ordered. 
    The State filed a notice of aggravation of circumstances pursuant to Missouri statutory guidelines. 
    At that time the petitioner filed a notice to quash those aggravating circumstances, contending that he was subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause and that any retrial or relitigation of an issue that had already been determined by a jury was precluded by that clause. 
    He also at that time contended that it would unnecessarily and needlessly chill his rights to a jury trial, that it would be... that any sentence of death at the second proceeding would be excessive and disproportionate to any sentence, the sentence of life at the first proceeding, and that the statutory provisions under which the State intended to proceed were vague and overbroad under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Sindel, what if your client had been convicted by the jury or the judge and sentenced to the death penalty in the first proceeding and it was set aside on the Duren ground?
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="172.628" stopTime="238.384">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    I think that at that particular time since there had been no determination by the jury of an acquittal or that death was not the appropriate sentence in this particular case, and a jury is specifically instructed in Missouri as to what they need to find. 
    They need to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and that that aggravating circumstance is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances that are presented, either statutory or non-statutory. 
    If at that time the jury had obviously determined that in fact an aggravating circumstance did exist, then I think the State would not be precluded, because it would not be tantamount or substantially equivalent to a verdict of acquittal. 
    In this particular case the State had one full fair opportunity to present to the jury their version and why this defendant should suffer with his life. 
    And at this, they presented all the evidence they wanted to, they presented all the evidence that they had. 
    In fact, they have conceded that they have no additional evidence.

speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="244.371" stopTime="318.586">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    Yes, I would. 
    I think that the verdict of acquittal... I don't believe that the State can seize upon the opportunity because of the trial court's necessary action considering the Missouri Supreme Court's refusal to recognize the decision in Taylor, the trial court's necessary action in putting this defendant to a trial, I do not think that they can seize upon that opportunity to muster additional evidence. 
    But I don't think that necessarily it makes any difference whether or not there is additional evidence or there is not, to the issue of double jeopardy. 
    The question is whether or not this defendant was placed in jeopardy, whether or not he went through the ordeal, the anguish of a trial and whether or not he should be subjected to that same ordeal, that same anguish, a second time when a jury, unobjected to by the State, a jury composed, in their opinion, I assume, properly, can then render a verdict of acquittal. 
    There's no question in Missouri that the sentencing phase is functionally equivalent to a trial. 
    There is no difference in a trial in the functioning phase except for the evidence that may be introduced.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Supposing your procedure required the jury to make special verdicts, and they had found that pursuant to Instruction No. 38 even though the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, as a matter of leniency we will not impose the death penalty.
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="346.172" stopTime="348.055">

    I believe that's... excuse me.

speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="350.890" stopTime="357.480">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    I would. 
    First, I would like to point out to the Court that that instruction does not have anything concerning leniency.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="357.480" stopTime="367.336">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I know, but it says they are not obligated to impose the death penalty even if they find in aggravating circumstance and also that the aggravating circumstance is not outweighed by the mitigating circumstance.
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="367.336" stopTime="375.708">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    And I believe that that instruction is consistent with this Court's decision in Lockett, wherein they say that there has to be allowance of a broad scope to the defendant.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="375.708" stopTime="387.082">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    There's no problem with the instruction. 
    My question is, what is your position if the jury had made it, articulated a basis for a decision that it was pursuant to this instruction rather than to any deficiency in the prosecutor's proof?
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="387.082" stopTime="434.111">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    But I think that that instruction does cover nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. 
    As I read that instruction, and as it is given to the jury, it allows them to determine from all the facts in the case, not those specific facts of aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstances but all the facts as to whether or not death is the appropriate sentence. 
    And I think that under that instruction, if they were in fact to return a verdict, special or otherwise... in other words, if they returned a verdict saying, we just didn't find any aggravating circumstances, I think that obviously that would be without question an acquittal. 
    If they returned a verdict and they said, the mitigating circumstances as submitted were such that we determined that they outweighed the aggravating circumstances, again that would be the functional equivalent of acquittal. 
    If they find--

    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    The jury has complete power under the Constitution of the United States. 
    They have the complete power to render any decisions that they wish and that cannot be attacked. 
    It cannot be dissected. 
    It cannot be circumscribed in such a way as to try and glean or pull from that decision why it came about. 
    In this particular situation it's obvious that no matter where the determination came from it came down, and they said, death is not the appropriate punishment, life is appropriate in this particular case, with this particular defendant. 
    And in the same way, by examining these factors and by determining that life in fact is the appropriate sentence, any other sentence under this Court's decision wouldn't necessarily be excessive and disproportionate; another part of our argument.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="539.814" stopTime="565.198">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Sindel, in your answer to Justice Brennan's question a moment ago you said the jury expressly found that death would be an inappropriate sentence in this case. 
    Was there a written interrogatory or written special verdict to that effect, or are you simply relying on the fact that they came in with a life sentence rather than the death sentence?
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="565.198" stopTime="726.368">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    There is no special interrogatory or special verdict form that's allowed in the State of Missouri. 
    However, I think that it's clear that if a jury comes back with a life imprisonment sentence, that they must have found that death was in fact inappropriate. 
    There is very little that they could have otherwise found. 
    The jury was death-qualified pursuant to Witherspoon, so there's obviously no people that are sitting on the jury that are so constituted that they could not impose the death penalty. 
    These are individuals who indicated under questioning that they could in fact impose the death penalty in the proper case under the proper circumstances. 
    The only thing that can be concluded is that in fact this was not the proper case or the proper circumstances. 
    Now, we would also contend that any sentence other than the sentence of life would have to be excessive and disproportionate under the Court's earlier decisions. 
    There's no question that the jury had the opportunity to weigh this particular defendant and in the vital interest of the community and the vital interest of the defendant, they determined that the only appropriate sentence was life. 
    So under those circumstances a retrial and allowing another jury to determine if the first jury was correct, and the Supreme Court of Missouri dealt with this by saying, we can't say whether or not the jury below was a maverick jury. 
    You don't really know. 
    But if you allow, if you allow the Supreme Court of Missouri to say that, then every time a life sentence comes down, they can say, that could have been the result of a maverick jury, and then the comparison test that is so vital to this Court's decisions in the holding that Georgia's statutes in Gregg, where they'd said that this appellate review is one of the vital elements that's necessary under the Eighth Amendment to insure and to guarantee both to the community and to the defendant that his rights under that amendment will be respected, will be lost. 
    I think it's important to point out in terms of the double jeopardy argument and in terms of every argument throughout this case that it is a death penalty case, and there's no question as to how unique it is. 
    This is why perhaps Stroud and Pearce and Chaffin need to be reconsidered. 
    They did not provide in those cases for the strict statutory guidelines for the sentence's discretion. 
    These guidelines are to focus the sentence on the particular circumstances of the case in such a way that we can assure ourselves, assure society, and assure the defendant that he is getting the benefit of all the constitutional rights, because it is a unique penalty.

    Now, there was no overruling of the Williams case because in U.S. v. Grayson that case was again upheld, and they said, the court can determine from the defendant's testimony if they believe that he was committing perjury, and they can use that, in fact, in sentencing. 
    So there's no question that you do not have to overrule. 
    But it is perhaps necessary to reconsider the decisions in those cases for two reasons. 
    One, those cases took place prior to this Court's decision in Gregg, recognizing how unique and irrevocable and final the sentence of death is, and two, the idea that the sentencing phase of this trial is exactly like a trial. 
    There are opening statements. 
    There is the introduction of evidence, and the taking of testimony. 
    There are instructions to the jury, there are arguments of counsel, there is then deliberation by that jury, and a verdict. 
    This is the functional equivalent of an acquittal. 
    If it walks, talks, and looks like a duck, it's a duck. 
    There can be no question that this defendant had to undergo the ordeals and the anxiety and the pressures that exist at trial. 
    Now, this Court in Breed recognized the existence of those pressures and that ordeal in a juvenile court case and they said, well, then, it doesn't have perhaps as many pressures as a situation where you're on trial in a felony case, but it's still enough, and we recognize that the defendant has a right to be protected for having to undergo those ordeals again. 
    There can be no question, the magnitude of the ordeal when you are being tried for your life, and there can be no question that this needs to be protected, that the defendant needs to have the protection from this Court of having to undergo that experience again, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees it to him. 
    In this Court's decision in Di Francesco there was remarks concerning the finality of judgments, and we are here talking about the finality of judgments, for that jury did render a final decision, a final verdict, and the State had their opportunity to make their case for death. 
    And the defendant in that case, unlike the defendant in Di Francesco, had a right and was entitled to expect the finality and the repose that is guaranteed to him under the Double Jeopardy Clause. 
    And unless he is accorded that, there is no question that the State can seize upon the opportunity again and again and again.

    Would there be any question in this Court if we had filed our motion, in that case, if they had returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, and perhaps guilty of one of the other offenses, that he could then be retried because we were able to obtain a reversal on that conviction? 
    I think that Green talks specifically in terms of that kind of forfeiture. 
    This is not a question of a waiver of rights, this is a question, then, does he forfeit the protections guaranteed to him under the Double Jeopardy Clause? 
    And Green talks specifically in terms of forfeiture, and that he is not to lose his right to a constitutionally composed jury in exchange for a valid plea of formal acquittal. 
    I think there can be no question in this case that that jury was constitutionally composed only to render a verdict of acquittal but they could unquestionably render that verdict.

    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    But we are not asking the Court to set aside a verdict of conviction. 
    We are asking the Court to recognize a verdict of acquittal, and that is a distinct difference. 
    In Scott they did not talk in terms of whether... they did talk in terms but found that that was not an acquittal. 
    But in this particular case it has no other coloring. 
    It is an acquittal. 
    There is no question that the jury was there and could acquit, that they had the evidence in front of them; the State has in the beginning conceded that there is no additional evidence. 
    So it's obvious that whatever evidence they're going to present at the second trial, it's identical to the evidence that they presented at the first trial, and there is no reason that the defendant should have to undergo that ordeal. 
    In fact, there's specific reason in the Constitution why he shouldn't have to undergo that ordeal. 
    And there's no reason why the prosecution should have a second bite at the apple when what we have is an acquittal. 
    We do not have the... setting aside the conviction because of preindictment delay, or because of motions to suppress, or other motions that do not go to the determination of factual elements of the offense.

    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    But the authorities have never dealt with the situation in what's been a bifurcated trial. 
    The jury is given specific guidelines, given instructions, submitted evidence to them, and then asked to make a determination as to whether or not that evidence is sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to establish the elements of the State's case. 
    And I think that that is the distinguishing characteristic that cannot be ignored. 
    I think also the fact that this is a death case makes it unique, perhaps the bifurcation. 
    The State argues that it is the bifurcation that we say is the unique part, but it's not really that. 
    The bifurcation serves the purpose both of the State and of the defendant. 
    It precludes the defendant from having to be subject to evidence that would not be relevant to his guilt, but it also allows a State the opportunity to present that evidence in an effort to persuade a jury that in fact they should return a verdict of guilt. 
    In fact, under the statutory provisions in Missouri, the one in which it says it's outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman, I assume that at that they could present inflammatory photographs that would not be relevant to guilt or innocence and would be precluded from the trial. 
    Under this particular circumstance they certainly could not come back into court after the jury had rendered a verdict of life imprisonment and say, wait a minute, I have some new photographs, and these photographs absolutely will convince that jury they should return a verdict of death. 
    Can I have another opportunity at it? 
    It's precluded from that.

    There has been the talk of the continuing waiver theory and whether or not he waives his right to the protection of the double jeopardy clause. 
    But Harlan talks, Justice Harlan talks in terms of the balancing of society's interests as against the defendants' interest, and in this particular case society's interest has been vindicated, it has been properly represented as well as the defendants'. 
    And at that time society through this jury spoke and they spoke and said, this man does not deserve to die.

    --It was a decision in which the jury was not presented with evidence as to why, in fact, a verdict or a particular sentence was proper. 
    And it did not involve this either-or decision similar to the guilt or innocence decision in a trial, at the particular trial phase, at the guilt phase of the trial. 
    Stroud does not, and I believe that the Gregg decision requires that Stroud be reconsidered in light of that. 
    Stroud, individually, at that time, did not have the entitlement to finality that this petitioner deserves. 
    And I think that it's only a reconsideration of Stroud rather than an overruling of the general principle there.

   Argument of James Cook
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1522.861" stopTime="1593.271">
    Mr. James Cook 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Petitioner in this case... excuse me. 
    My name is James Cook, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County and I represent the respondent, the State of Missouri. 
    Petitioner in this Court has asked this Court to do certain things, but it is our position that if the death penalty is a legitimate state interest, and if jury sentencing is a legitimate State interest, and if as a general principle increased sentences on retrial does not go against the Constitution as long as we protect against vindictiveness, then there should be no prohibition against a State seeking the death penalty in this particular case. 
    We believe that what the petitioner asks this Court to do basically is to overrule Stroud, Pearce, Chaffin, and Di Francesco, at the very least. 
    First position is that the procedure that we now have for death penalty cases, that being the bifurcation, makes the sentencing like a decision of guilt or innocence.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1593.271" stopTime="1607.864">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Cook, in Missouri is the jury ever asked to specifically determine what aggravating circumstances and what mitigating circumstances they find present in the case?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1607.864" stopTime="1620.505">
    Mr. James Cook 
    If they come back with the death penalty, they must state which of the aggravating circumstances they have found beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    If they come back with life, we don't know if they found that aggravating circumstances existed, so as to ignore--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1620.505" stopTime="1630.943">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They may have found no aggravating circumstances or they may have found that there were mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances, or they just may have been merciful.
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1630.943" stopTime="1632.429">
    Mr. James Cook 
    --Right. 
    We don't know.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1632.429" stopTime="1646.405">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Suppose there was a jury came in and said, we find, we impose life because the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating ones?

    Mr. James Cook 
    I don't think that that would be a problem here.

    Well, would it... could you then retry him?

    --I think so.

    And ask for death penalty?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1656.111" stopTime="1658.380">

    Particularly in light of--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1658.380" stopTime="1670.187">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if they said, we find that aggravating circumstance A was not present? 
    Could you then on retrial press that same aggravating circumstance?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1670.187" stopTime="1673.972">
    Mr. James Cook 
    --I'm not sure. 
    I think that on one hand you could say res judicata.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1673.972" stopTime="1674.589">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1674.589" stopTime="1685.447">
    Mr. James Cook 
    On the other hand, though, this Court has approved the statutory theory of Florida which is that even if the jury doesn't find the aggravating circumstances, the judge can. 
    So I think that--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1685.447" stopTime="1692.618">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you're relying mostly, then, on the fact this is a general verdict, and the jury just might have been merciful?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1692.618" stopTime="1704.076">
    Mr. James Cook 
    --I don't want to say I'm relying on that but I do assume that. 
    What I'm relying on is that the procedure alone does not make this into a decision like--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1704.076" stopTime="1736.547">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if you assume that the jury imposed life because they found there were no aggravating circumstances you have a problem about pressing the same aggravating circumstances, if you just assumed that that's what the jury did. 
    I would take your case as not so clear either if the jury said there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances and the State on retrial says, we're going to present precisely the same evidence.
speaker="james_cook" startTime="1736.547" stopTime="1880.607">
    Mr. James Cook 
    --Right. 
    I believe my position is easier because of the way the jury system is set up, the instructions under the general verdict type of approach to the specific verdicts. 
    But I think that you still need to look at the policy behind why we apply double jeopardy. 
    We apply double jeopardy not really because of the finality, or repose, or the other things that we've talked about. 
    I submit that this Court has suggested or found that we apply double jeopardy in order basically to protect the individual against government oppression. 
    The Double Jeopardy Clause is in a way an exception to our basic legal system, which is to find the truth by having your day in court and making sure on appeal that that day in court was done properly. 
    And under that system you would say, well, the State should be able to check and have an appeal to make sure that was done properly. 
    But we cannot protect against government oppression and still do that so we make a blanket exception to that and put it in the Bill of Rights and say, okay, the State only gets one shot. 
    But we do give exceptions to that by saying, if the defendant appeals, the slate is wiped clean. 
    We don't say that in a way of vindictiveness. 
    We say that to emphasize the fact that it is only the defendant that can set aside a conviction. 
    And of course he wouldn't be interested in setting aside an acquittal. 
    So that when you would take this policy and you try to apply it to the sentencing procedures, or sentencing at all, as was recognized in several of the recent cases, it doesn't apply. 
    Because you have said, or this Court has said that there's no absolute bar against increasing a sentence. 
    The only concern we have against increasing a sentence is to protect against vindictiveness. 
    And we say, in a judge sentencing situation, we have to do that by adding the Pearce limitations, but in the jury sentencing situation we don't have that concern. 
    There is not that concern about vindictiveness, so we don't need to have the double jeopardy applying to sentences. 
    Therefore, I think this procedure does not make this into an acquittal. 
    Bifurcation is for the protection of the defendant, it is not meant to give the sentencing a greater finality than it ever had before.

    I see what you're saying and I think that this Court has rejected that argument.

    Mr. James Cook 
    Petitioner mentions that death is unique and therefore that is one of the reasons why this Court can distinguish This case from Stroud, or certainly, Pearce and Chaffin, and Di Francesco, even. 
    I would suggest that, and agree, that that is unique, that the death penalty is very unique and this Court has bent over backwards, perhaps, to put out extra special procedures for making extra care that the death penalty is only imposed in certain specific situations. 
    But the uniqueness of death does not allow it to change the basic rules of law called double jeopardy and due process and equal protection, and that is what petitioner asks you to do, and asks you to say as far as Stroud and Chaffin and Pearce that in all cases except death penalty cases double jeopardy means thus-and-such, but in death penalty cases it means something else. 
    I don't think you can do that, because I think that whittles away at the underpinnings of the whole legal system, which is the Due Process Clause, Double Jeopardy Clause.

speaker="james_cook" startTime="2219.757" stopTime="2245.891">
    Mr. James Cook 
    No. 
    I think that this Court has historically in applying due process made sure that certain procedures are followed, that certain laws not be allowed to take away the defendant's due process, but it did not change due process, which is what I think you have to do to make an exception for the uniqueness of death.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Cook, hasn't the State of Missouri itself taken the view that death is different by setting up a special procedure for imposing the death penalty?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, would it be necessarily undermining the entire legal system to say that the rules with respect to capital sentencing are somewhat different as a constitutional matter from the rules for lesser sentences? 
    And that's certainly implicit in the Gardner holding, isn't it?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="2271.506" stopTime="2278.779">
    Mr. James Cook 
    Yes, sir, I think that raises it perhaps too high, that it raises it above the constitutional procedures.

    Do you think it's perfectly clear that the Di Francesco holding will apply to death cases... to death?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="2287.968" stopTime="2312.583">
    Mr. James Cook 
    I think that the underlying assumptions and findings in the Di Francesco can apply too, yes; recognizing that sentencing is different, and whether that be a sentencing concerning death or not does not make any difference here. 
    Certainly in other situations and in the procedures that we follow and the safeguards that we set up, it does make a difference.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2312.583" stopTime="2335.549">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    To put the question more directly, supposing Missouri had a procedure that if the jury does what it did in this case, find no death penalty is appropriate, would it be constitutionally permissible for the State to say, well, there shall be an appeal to an appellate court which could reverse that determination and decide that, well, we think there should be a death penalty, evidence of aggravating circumstances are pretty strong, and so forth?
speaker="james_cook" startTime="2335.549" stopTime="2360.350">
    Mr. James Cook 
    I think so, because I think that's what you have in Florida, where you have what is called an advisory jury opinion. 
    But certainly I wouldn't think that this Court would allow a state legislature to just call something advisory when in fact it is a jury determination of finding of death or life. 
    And certainly, in that situation, the judge can overrule it. 
    Now, there are certain procedural safeguards.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2360.350" stopTime="2381.145">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What about a procedure that said, we'll have a bifurcated hearing except that if the jury finds no death penalty we'll have a second jury empaneled and have them take another look at it and have a trial? 
    I suppose that'd be permissible too. 
    To just specifically say, the State shall have two chances to persuade someone that the death penalty is appropriate? 
    That's, I guess, what they have in Florida.

speaker="james_cook" startTime="2471.351" stopTime="2561.594">
    Mr. James Cook 
    I think so; yes. 
    The other issues presented by the petitioner include the disproportionate and excessiveness, which I'd like to address briefly. 
    It's argued that on one hand a sentence at the second trial of death would be automatically disproportionate, and the Georgia Supreme Court has so held. 
    I argue that that is just, I don't feel logical, in that I don't think it was what was anticipated the drafters of this legislation nor by this Court when it approved the comparison of one case with other similar cases. 
    I think that was authorized or mandated, one, to protect against prejudicial imposing of the death sentence, let us say, only on minorities, or only on poor people; or, to protect against the aberrant jury. 
    Where we take one case and compare it with itself, though, how do you know which is the right decision? 
    How do you know which one is aberrant? 
    That's just, I don't think, logical. 
    What this has anticipated here is looking at this case in light of other typical, shall I say, kidnap murder cases, or looking at a holdup murder case. 
    And if in several holdup murder cases or kidnap murder cases similar to this the death penalty was not imposed, then this is the aberrant jury.

speaker="james_cook" startTime="2593.879" stopTime="2835.937">
    Mr. James Cook 
    It's conceded that the aggravating circumstances are identical. 
    The State will attempt to present more evidence on this issue than it was allowed to the first time in that we were only allowed to read to the jury the stated offense, as opposed to giving the jury any of the facts of that case which would allow it to make a determination of whether it was a serious assaultive conviction or not. 
    But that's a trial court decision that we're going to try to change the trial court's mind on. 
    I don't think disproportionateness applies, and excessiveness is also mentioned. 
    I don't think that applies either, again for the same reason as I've indicated in the Proffitt decision where a death sentence following a life cannot per se be excessive. 
    It may be, but you have to look at more than just the one other case. 
    There's a concern here that this decision would chill the right of the defendant to seek a jury trial in his second case, and of course the petitioner relies on the Jackson decision. 
    It's our position that this Court has cited that issue in respondent's favor in Chaffin where, although it is concerned about that, it felt that those difficult decisions sometimes have to be made. 
    And it distinguished Jackson, in that in Jackson it was stated that there was no other purpose or result of that procedure than to chill the defendant's right to a jury trial. 
    It's our position that there is another purpose or result in this procedure, and that is the stated and approved government, or State interest, in having jury sentencing, and that as long as you have jury sentencing, and as long as that is considered a legitimate State interest, then that is a legitimate State purpose or result. 
    Also, I would indicate that although Petitioner indicates that the defendant would be absolutely precluded from getting the death penalty if he waives his jury, that is not necessarily so, because he relies on the fact that he would then come under the Pearce provisions and the judge could not give death unless something new had arisen. 
    But I don't think that we would ever be absolutely sure of that until the moment or sentencing. 
    I'm not implying that anything new has arisen which would cause the judge in this particular case to give the death penalty but for the Court to find that this chilled his right because he would be absolutely precluded from getting the death penalty by the judge would not be accurate, because there may be those cases where the judge could in fact give the death penalty. 
    So the decision is not the decision as it was in Jackson. 
    Petitioner also asked this Court basically to rule that the two aggravating circumstances here are too vague and overbroad. 
    And the Missouri court has ignored this Court's rulings about the narrowing of the aggravating circumstance that was decided in Godfrey. 
    And certainly that is one of the circumstances we're using in this case. 
    I would merely point out that the decision below in the Missouri Supreme Court was handed down before your decision in Godfrey, that the Missouri Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to decide any death penalty cases yet and has not had the opportunity to follow this Court's decision, and so we would ask that this Court give the Missouri Supreme Court the opportunity to constitutionally narrow those aggravating circumstances. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    That is one part of it, and that the procedure used to obtain the sentence of death is different as well. 
    I think that this is one of the reasons that Di Francesco needs to be overruled and this Court needn't concern itself with overruling the Di Francesco case. 
    In fact, in oral arguments in that case, Mr. Frey who so ably represented the U.S. Government indicated that this was a question of legal air. 
    We're not talking here about whether or not there's legal air. 
    He also indicated that under certain circumstances... in response to Justice Stevens' questions... under certain circumstances, especially the death penalty, there are certain probative problems of procedural fairness that would have to be considered. 
    So obviously Di Francesco does not apply to this particular case. 
    Di Francesco did not have the adversarial proceeding that is contained and is mandated by Gardner v. Florida.

    I'd like to correct that point. 
    If you read the brief... well, excuse me... but if the State would have properly read the brief, he'll see that nowhere do I raise the point that any sentence of death would be vindictive.

speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="3033.216" stopTime="3137.636">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    I believe so. 
    I think Beck v. Alabama specifically says that. 
    They say that because death is unique, there is a higher requirement, and that Beck v. Alabama recognizes, although no other case recognizes, that lesser included offenses in a death case must be submitted, and that is because of the necessity for that higher requirement of due process. 
    I also believe that in applying death, it says that to apply the death penalty in the Beck case, there must be this elevated procedure that is followed, and there's no question that it has to be followed under the Eighth Amendment prescriptions. 
    I think that in Di Francesco the argument that was presented is consistent somewhat with Professor Westen's argument in his article that's quoted there, "The Triptych of Double Jeopardy", the idea that there are three things that Double Jeopardy Clause is to protect, the finality of jury verdicts of acquittal, the lawful administration of sentence, and third, the expectation of finality or repose that exists in the defendant after he has undergone the ordeal of trial. 
    I would suggest that if you use the Wayne technique that Professor Westen suggests, and also we cite to a new article that he has written in our supplemental brief, distinguishing Di Francesco, in which he talked specifically about this case, that argument would hold water, and that Di Francesco needn't be distinguished as well as Stroud and Pearce needn't be overruled to sustain a decision in this particular case that Mr. Bullington need not undergo the ordeal of a trial again. 
    The prosecutor has indicated--

    Justice White 
    You mean the death sentencing procedure?
speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="3139.386" stopTime="3158.431">
    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    --That's correct. 
    The prosecutor has indicated that at the second phase of the trial he looks to go into perhaps the facts surrounding the alleged serious assaultive convictions. 
    These are 13-year-old convictions that the defendant had prior to this trial. 
    I think that this is somewhat indicative of the problems--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3158.431" stopTime="3167.203">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If... if we agree with you on the retrial which will go forward, will the jury do the sentencing?

    Mr. Richard H. Sindel 
    --Yes.

    Yes.

    Of capital murder; right.
