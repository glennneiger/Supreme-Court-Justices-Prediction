    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case is 79-1266, Steadman versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    This petition brings up for a review of judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    In administrative proceedings, the Securities and Exchange Commission applies a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard of proof in determining whether the antifraud provisions of the federal security laws have been violated. 
    Petitioner Steadman, a subject of a disciplinary proceeding initiated by the Commission has insisted that such violations must be proved by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. 
    The Court of Appeals on review of a Commission order disciplining the petitioner rejected his argument and held that in a disciplinary proceeding before the Commission, violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws may be established by a preponderance-of-the-evidence. 
    We agree and affirm the judgement of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Powell joined by Justice Stewart dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.
