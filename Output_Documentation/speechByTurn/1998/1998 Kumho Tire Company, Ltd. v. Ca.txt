    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The first case is Kumho Tire Co. v. Patrick Carmichael. 
    It follows from the case we decided six years ago called Daubert v. Merrell Dow, and in that case the Court held that District Courts should not admit expert scientific testimony unless the District Judge thought it was reliable. 
    The Court there also said when the judge carries out that gatekeeping function, it may ask certain specific questions concerning theories, testability, peer review, error rate, and acceptance within a relevant scientific community. 
    Those questions could help determine whether scientific testimony is reliable. 
    In this case we again consider the admissibility of expert testimony, only this time the case involves not scientific testimony, but expert engineering testimonies. 
    The case arises out of an automobile accident that took place in 1993. 
    The plaintiffs were driving in a minivan, the van’s right rear tire blew out and the plaintiffs thought it was a defective tire and they brought a tort suit against the manufacturer and its distributor. 
    To help prove the case the plaintiffs wanted to introduce the testimony of a tire failure expert, and he was going to testify that the tire was defective. 
    He reached that conclusion based upon his own visual and tactile examination of the tire, and also upon a theory that if the tire was not defective he could tell by the presence of certain rather specific physical marks. 
    The District Court excluded that testimony. 
    The judge asked the questions that I mentioned before, the specific questions from Daubert and he said he thought the answers to those questions showed the expert’s testimony was not reliable. 
    But the Court of Appeals reversed, because the question was asked not of a scientific expert but of a different kind of expert, and in the Court of Appeals’ view the Daubert questions and Daubert didn’t apply. 
    We disagree with the Court of Appeals. 
    We hold first, that the basic gatekeeping obligation that Daubert discussed which is tied back to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 702, obligation to assure that testimony is not only relevant but reliable. 
    We hold that that obligation, that gatekeeping function, applies not just to scientific testimony but to all expert testimony. 
    Second, in carrying out that Rule we say that the Court may consider the four more specific questions that Daubert mentions about testability, acceptance, etcetera. 
    The Eleventh Circuit had held that a trial judge may ask questions of this sort only where an expert relies on the application of scientific principles, but not where the expert relies on skill or experience based observation. 
    But we disagree with that. 
    We think sometimes these questions or factors could be relevant to that kind of testimony, and in our view the Rule of Evidence doesn’t match certain kinds of questions to certain kinds of experts. 
    Life and the legal cases that it generates is simply too complex to warrant a definitive match. 
    At the same time we emphasize in respect to those specific questions the word ‘may’, that is to say the judge ‘may’ use those questions. 
    Their use will not always be appropriate. 
    The trial judge must have considerable leeway in determining how to go about determining whether the particular expert testimony is reliable, and the judge should consider the specific factors where there are reasonable measures of reliability. 
    Third, the trial judge must have the same kind of legal attitude in deciding how to test an expert’s reliability, what kind of procedures to have, as the trial judge enjoys when he decides or he/she decides whether that expert’s relevant testimony is reliable. 
    On review for that decision an abusive discretion standard will apply. 
    Then finally, our opinion to show an example of the principles I just discussed, it reviews in detail the specific decision at issue here, namely the decision about this tire failure expert. 
    I think I will spare you with details in this oral statement of tire failure analysis, so the briefs run into that matter rather thoroughly, and thus we learned quite a lot about that. 
    It is a very interesting subject, and lot of rich detail there. 
    After examining the record we conclude that the Trial Court’s decision to apply the specific Daubert factor here and to exclude the testimony, those decisions were reasonable ones and therefore lawful ones. 
    Because we agree with the District Court’s conclusion and because the Court of Appeals did not agree with that conclusion, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices O’Connor and Thomas join; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
