    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 97-475, El Al Israel Airlines v. Tsui Tseng. 
    Ms. Wilson.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="10.908" stopTime="51.635">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    We are here today requesting the Court to hold that a multilateral treaty of the United States, commonly known as the Warsaw Convention, exclusively governs recovery for passenger injury sustained in the course of international air carriage. 
    We are not contending for a broad right to avoid liability. 
    We are requesting the Court to uphold the faithful reading of the convention. 
    Ms. Tseng is seeking purely emotional distress damages as a result of being subjected to a security search, an integral and vital part of maintaining the safety and security of international air transportation. 
    The legal issue before the Court, however, is not confined to the issue presented in her case. 
    It is a global issue because there are over 120 nations adhering to the Warsaw Convention.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    May I ask you a preliminary question that is a little confusing? 
    The court below found that this was not an accident. 
    Is that right?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="66.254" stopTime="66.825">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="66.825" stopTime="69.386">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And we take the case on that assumption.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="69.386" stopTime="70.478">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="70.478" stopTime="83.686">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And there is an article in the convention setting aside limits of liability in the case of willful misconduct, but we don't have that issue before us in this case?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="83.686" stopTime="95.654">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    I would submit, Justice O'Connor, you do not because the trial court found that there was no willful misconduct in the facts of this case, and that finding was not disturbed by the court of appeals, and therefore I do not believe it is before the Court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="95.654" stopTime="110.332">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And if there were a case of willful misconduct, then there... there would be no limit on the liability, or you would look to the law of the nation trying the case to determine that liability?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="110.332" stopTime="155.492">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Justice O'Connor, we would submit that you do not reach the issue of willful misconduct if you do not reach the threshold issue of meeting the conditions under article 17. 
    Willful misconduct wasn't intended to be read outside of the convention. 
    If you were to do so, then you would be not reading into the convention the fact that articles 17, 18, and 19 state the instances when the carrier shall be held liable. 
    Article 25... excuse me... article 22 limits that liability, and article 25, you lose the limit if you have willful misconduct. 
    But if you read that there's a recovery outside of the convention that your holding is that you have an instance where you have passengers attempting to prove that there isn't an accident so that they are unable to seek damages without limit.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="155.492" stopTime="162.298">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So, in any event in this case, we simply don't address the issue of article 25 and how that would bear on it.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="162.298" stopTime="164.809">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There's no reason to address that in this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="164.809" stopTime="182.760">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Except that under your interpretation, we are left with the... with the surely unusual situation in which if there is a willful tort committed by a carrier, so long as it is not an accident, there is no recovery. 
    That's... extraordinary.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="182.760" stopTime="184.022">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, it--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="184.022" stopTime="188.854">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Isn't that right? 
    I mean, isn't that the consequence of... of the interpretation you're giving to the... to the treaty?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="188.854" stopTime="196.449">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    If you don't satisfy both conditions, bodily injury and an accident, you're not entitled to recover under the convention.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="196.449" stopTime="199.013">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why would anyone write a treaty like that? 
    I mean--
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="199.013" stopTime="225.562">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, at the time that the convention was drafted, it was 1929. 
    The carriers were free to disclaim any and all liability, and it was a compromise to have the liability that was created under the convention to be limited except for in the circumstances provided for. 
    So, if you allow the passengers to seek unlimited recovery outside the convention, you're creating an incentive for them to try and prove there isn't an accident so that when they don't have bodily injury, they can seek unlimited damages.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="225.562" stopTime="239.230">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --But that still doesn't seem to me a good explanation for why the convention would cover accidents that really were no fault of the carrier and exclude liability for something that's intentional wrongdoing on the part of the carrier.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="239.230" stopTime="275.984">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, they... I don't believe the drafters thought they were doing that because when they drafted the convention, they also had article 20 which was the all necessary measures defense. 
    Although carriers that fly into and out of the United States are not entitled to avail themselves of the all necessary measures defense, that's where the fault issue really came into play. 
    It was the unusual, unexpected occurrence as defined by Saks which would determine whether you have the accident requirement, and even if you did, if the carrier was able to establish that it had taken all reasonable measures that it could take, it wouldn't be liable. 
    And if... it was only if you weren't able to establish that burden as the carrier, then you would have limited liability.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="275.984" stopTime="296.670">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why isn't it just as fair a reading... and granted, article 25 is not before us in this case, but when we're construing the convention as a whole, we have to have some mind for the type of thing article 25 covers... just as fair a reading of article 25 to say that the convention does permit recovery, but the limits are off?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="296.670" stopTime="304.583">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    To do that, I believe you have to ignore the scheme as to how the articles under the liability chapter were set forth.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="304.583" stopTime="348.572">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Wilson, it might help if you gave examples of what has been considered willful misconduct. 
    A very recent example is the KAL case; that is, it is an accident, but the conduct was found by a jury to be... to amount to willful misconduct. 
    So, as far as I know, the cases that have come up under the convention involving willful misconduct have been categorized as accidents, and then the question is, if the conduct was so egregious, the limits on liability are off. 
    Is there any case of willful misconduct other than the KAL pattern?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="348.572" stopTime="387.618">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, there are the willful misconduct instances with respect to, for example, the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing. 
    The terrorist attack of placing the bomb on board the aircraft wasn't what was found to be the willful misconduct, although it clearly was intentional conduct. 
    The willful misconduct on the part of the carrier had to do with their security measures and their program or the lack thereof. 
    And there are other instances in which the... there have been terrorist attacks or hijackings in which the carriers are found to be responsible in damages, but they're not held to the level of willful misconduct. 
    And, therefore, the limit of the passengers is the limit that is applicable.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="387.618" stopTime="401.108">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In the Lockerbie situation, would the... would the carrier's... let's say it is willful... failure to... to have adequate security measures... would that be considered an accident so that you could come under the treaty?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="401.108" stopTime="415.987">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, the court didn't address on point, when they reached the Lockerbie decision, the issue of whether the security measures was what triggered the accident requirement.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="415.987" stopTime="418.649">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, just tell me your view.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="418.649" stopTime="420.029">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, my view is that the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="420.029" stopTime="420.850">

    Would that be an accident?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="420.850" stopTime="437.350">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    --Well, yes, but... but it also would have... the accident also could be the unusual and unexpected event of having the bomb placed on the aircraft, but the conduct of the carrier that rose to the level of intentional, the willful misconduct on the part of the carrier, was their security program.

    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Yes, I believe that would... could constitute an accident. 
    I just don't think that was what the court--

    I see.

    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="452.190" stopTime="457.885">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    They said we... we want no security.

speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="457.885" stopTime="478.678">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    No. 
    I believe, Your Honor, that the Lockerbie decision rested more on the fact that Pan Am was charging a $5 surcharge per passenger for the heightened security that they claimed that they were providing when, in fact, it turned out that the trial showed that they had done such things as taken dogs from the local pound and pretended like they were trained as dog--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="478.678" stopTime="481.090">

speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="481.090" stopTime="485.133">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    --Right. 
    In fact, you could say they were misrepresenting the nature of the security they were providing.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="485.133" stopTime="506.618">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Do I understand that from your point of view it doesn't matter? 
    If this were an accident, then the district court said, yes, it's an accident, but there was no bodily injury. 
    End of case. 
    So, you're here contesting the Second Circuit decision, but as far as your client is concerned, categorization of an accident... as an accident would be fine. 
    Is that--
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="506.618" stopTime="571.330">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Well, broadly speaking, that's true, but in the context of international security, to hold that the provision of security services is an unusual and unexpected event, I do not think would be borne out. 
    The... we didn't need to reach that issue in this case because you need to meet both conditions in order to recover under the convention, and it was undisputed by the respondent that plaintiff did not sustain a bodily injury and that she was in the course of embarkation. 
    So, the only issue that ended up going up insofar as the respondent was concerned when he appealed or, I should say, Ms. Tseng appealed to the Second Circuit was whether the court was incorrect in finding that the search constituted an accident. 
    But for us to bring it up to this level, it's the... it's the broader issue of whether or not the treaty is exclusive, and if you don't meet both conditions, you don't have a right to recovery. 
    And in this particular case, you didn't have to reach the accident issue because she didn't have bodily injury.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --I suppose we ought to let you address this case. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="574.252" stopTime="692.879">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Thank you. 
    The... the court did not have squarely before it, until this case, the question of exclusivity, but we believe that the Franklin Mint, Saks, Chan, Floyd, and Zicherman decisions nevertheless issued a... a line of cases which should have directed the lower court to find that the convention is exclusive. 
    In Franklin Mint, the Court recognized the dual purposes of the convention, which were to create a uniform body of aviation law and to limit the carrier's presumptive liability. 
    In Saks, the Court broadly defined what constitutes an accident contemplated by article 17 and held that the carrier is liable to a passenger only if the passenger proves there was an accident that was the cause of the injury. 
    Then in Chan, the Court enforced the limited liability created by the drafters and looked to the parallel notice provisions with respect to baggage and cargo to interpret the notice provision for the passenger tickets. 
    In Floyd, the Court enforced the article 17 bodily injury requirement holding that the carrier cannot be held liable under 17 unless the accident has caused bodily injury. 
    In Zicherman, the Court gave the most natural reading of article 24 and held that in an action brought under article 17, article 24 directs the lower court to look to local law to determine the measure of the passenger's recovery and who may bring a suit. 
    We contend that in this case that the Court once again needs to interpret the convention as a whole and not attempt to divine what article 17 or article 24 means read standing alone. 
    The carrier has created a clear scheme of liability to... to govern international transportation, and if you read the scheme in terms of the chapter 3 liability, the only sensible reading is that the convention was intended to be exclusive, the passenger was entitled to limited... to limited recovery if the passenger met the conditions under article 17.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="692.879" stopTime="711.603">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is... do I correctly understand that your position is that it does not matter whether this is a case covered by article 17 or not? 
    All you have to say is something happened during the course of international travel, and that's the end of the ball game unless there's recovery under article 17.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="711.603" stopTime="724.412">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Justice Stevens, I wouldn't agree with that position because I do not view article 17 as determining the scope of the convention. 
    Article 1 determines the scope. 
    Article 17 tells when you're going to be liable--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="724.412" stopTime="745.474">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but article 17 surely is relevant to deciding whether article 24 applies, or do you think it's not relevant? 
    Because article 24(2) says, in... starts out that in the cases covered by article 17 and so forth. 
    And I... when I see something like that, I think, well, the first thing I've got to decide is whether or not it's covered by article 17, and I think you're saying it doesn't really make any difference whether it's covered by 17.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="745.474" stopTime="756.493">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    --Well, I... I don't in the sense that I say covered by 17 means that they concern passenger injury or death cases, not that it concerns whether or not you have a recoverable claim under article 17.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="756.493" stopTime="768.220">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I still... I'm still not sure. 
    Do you think it makes any difference in... to your case whether the case is covered by article 17 or not? 
    And if so, is it or is it not?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="768.220" stopTime="779.667">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    It is a passenger injury case, and therefore it falls under article 17, but the passenger in this instance does not state a recoverable claim under 17.

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    See, the problem I have, this is... I want to get it on the table so you have an opportunity to... is that if you say the universe covered by article 17 is all cases, it's a little tension with the language of article 17 which describes the universe of cases in which the carrier shall be liable. 
    But you're suggesting article 17 also covers cases in which the... the carrier shall not be liable.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="850.035" stopTime="879.364">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    I do suggest that, Your Honor, because I suggest that article 1 is intended to provide for all of international air transportation for passengers for hire, and article 17 I do not believe should have to have a subparagraph 2 saying that unless you meet these conditions... if you don't meet these conditions, you're entitled to sue outside the convention. 
    I believe that if you read the language fairly, that... and you read that in relation to all the other provisions under article... excuse me... chapter 3--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="879.364" stopTime="891.783">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but the mere fact that article 1 says the convention shall apply doesn't necessarily mean... maybe it did... doesn't necessarily mean it shall preempt every other source of recovery. 
    It just doesn't... in plain language, it doesn't say that.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="914.036" stopTime="973.678">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, to make that clear, don't we really look outside the text? 
    I mean, you can... you can go back to the introductory sentence of article 1.1 and I suppose still theoretically have a question open as to whether, given the applicability of the convention to... to all possible instances here, the convention may still allow, in effect, by reference to outside law, the possibility of... of a claim under domestic law. 
    And to answer that question definitively, don't we have to look outside the text of the convention and... and consider the... the intentions that were expressed at the time this language was... was proposed and adopted? 
    For example, the... the statement of the British representative to the Warsaw Convention, that there's no more common law. 
    Don't we have to look to things like the no more common law statement in order to get to a definitive answer to the question that we have?
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="973.678" stopTime="1014.384">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    I believe that because treaties should be faithfully upheld, that it is appropriate to look to the drafting history in respect of the Warsaw Convention, in particular the Warsaw minutes which were transcribed by Horner and Legrez, and if you read them in total, including the comments of Sir Alfred Dennis and the reporter and various other delegates, it's clear that they were intending it to be all encompassing with respect to passenger claims. 
    But I... I do believe that you'd be doing so to confirm the reading, which is that if you read the articles and read the structure in the scheme of the convention, the conclusion should be that the convention is exclusive.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1014.384" stopTime="1047.226">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I'm surprised that you don't put weight on article 24 because I thought it was that article that clarifies that the convention is meant to be exclusive for these categories, personal injury, baggage delay, exclusive of any other actions of tort... whatever it may be. 
    And you don't get it just from article 17 in the Gestalt of the convention, but you have an exclusivity article written right into the convention.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="1047.226" stopTime="1076.345">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Justice Ginsburg, I... I do take the position that article 24 is telling the courts that you are not permitted to look outside the convention for causes of action. 
    I... I believe that 24 has to be read in conjunction with 17 and with 1, and... and the articles all interrelate under chapter 3, including articles 17 and 24, to reach the conclusion that you cannot have a recovery outside the convention. 
    If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve rebuttal.

    The grammatical structure of article 17 is very similar in the French as in the English. 
    I think Justice Stevens' question turns on the interpretation of the introductory clause of article 24 which, as Justice Ginsburg points out, is the focus of the exclusivity analysis here. 
    And Justice Stevens was concerned that because the language in the cases covered by article 17 doesn't explicitly say in all personal injury cases, the convention is not exclusive as to some.

    As an initial matter, I should point out the House of Lords also thought that that was in fact the appropriate language to focus on in... in this circumstance and determined, as we believe is correct, that the framers of the convention intended that introductory clause as a shorthand to denote the class of personal injury cases generally as opposed to the class of cases involving damages--

    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechtherlein 
    Well, the... there... there is no indication in the proceedings that led up to the change in language that anyone contemplated that this would make any difference in the exclusivity analysis. 
    And as we point out, even under the original language of article 24, the House of Lords was correct in interpreting the introductory clause as meaning precisely what... the significance that we give it, which is that in personal injury cases, if you cannot satisfy the important conditions for liability set out in article 17, then you may not use your very failure to satisfy those conditions as a basis for seeking unlimited liability under local law without regard to the convention.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is it correct that the conditions for liability under 17, as you view the treaty, are simply physical harm and being in the course of international travel? 
    There's no fault requirement, or is there a fault requirement?
speaker="jonathan_e_nuechtherlein" startTime="1373.354" stopTime="1375.667">
    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechtherlein 
    Under the convention there is not a fault requirement.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1375.667" stopTime="1382.349">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, the only conditions you're talking about is somebody got hurt while he was on an airplane... in international travel.
speaker="jonathan_e_nuechtherlein" startTime="1382.349" stopTime="1486.457">
    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechtherlein 
    If there was an accident, and that is also an important requirement. 
    In Saks, this point... this Court pointed out that the framers of the convention deemed it essential to confine the class of cases in which passengers can recover for injuries incurred within the scope of the convention to cases in which there was an... there was an unexpected or unusual event that was external to the passenger. 
    The framers did not want to create a liability for cases where, for example, someone has a peculiar medical reaction to the ordinary circumstances of air travel. 
    Under the court of appeals' reading of this convention, it is precisely a passenger's failure to satisfy that important threshold requirement for recovery under the convention that entitles the passenger to escape the convention scheme of limited liability and sue for potentially unlimited liability under local law without regards to the convention. 
    In our view, that would be very anomalous. 
    The... the court of appeals' reasoning would also appear to apply in cases where a passenger suffered purely psychological injuries as opposed to physical injuries. 
    Again, in Floyd, this Court determined that the framers of the convention meant to... to withhold liability in cases where a passenger could claim only psychological injury. 
    To hold, as the court of appeals did, that a failure to satisfy article 17's liability conditions takes you outside the scope of the convention creates the following anomaly. 
    It would mean that if you were a passenger on an airplane who was merely traumatized when the airplane drops suddenly 2,000 feet in altitude, you could sue potentially for unlimited liability without regard to the convention. 
    Whereas, another passenger on the same airplane could... if that passenger also bumped her head, in addition to being traumatized, would be confined by... by the convention's liability caps, and that result we suggest would make very little sense.

    Do you have any... I couldn't find anywhere... I'll get it, but I haven't read it yet.

    I mean, you lose if you apply it literally. 
    You have to really look beyond that language and say does it forbid an interpretation that is required, says the House of Lords, by looking at the treaty as a whole. 
    So, I don't find in one of these briefs, anywhere in an appendix, the treaty as a whole, which isn't that long.

    And in cases foreseen, well, or covered, however you want to put it, those seem to be cases of injury, physical injury.

    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    Montreal No. 4 was enacted 5 or 6 years after this incident occurred. 
    Montreal No. 4 is prospective, as the Solicitor General pointed out in his brief. 
    Montreal number--

    My position--

    --cannot, by later saying it meant something else, cause it to have meant something else.

speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="1759.479" stopTime="1798.845">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    My... my contention is that the treaty says... means what it says, and what it means is that article 1, which defines the scope and the breadth of the convention as dealing with international air transportation, does not preclude or preempt anything, that article 20... if it did preempt everything, then article 24 would be unnecessary. 
    Article 24 is the only preemption or the only exclusive provision for convention exclusivity that there is, and article 24, as applicable in this situation, refers only... in personal injury cases, refers only to cases covered by article 17.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1798.845" stopTime="1834.609">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you must admit it produces results that make the whole treaty seem quite pointless. 
    I mean, the whole purpose of the treaty was to come to some common agreement as to the liability of carriers, and the... and the agreement that you say they signed says that in the event of personal injuries in the narrow situation where it's caused by an accident and there is physical injury, you can sue under the convention and you're limited, and in all other situations, you're remanded to whatever the local law is so that there will be innumerable divergent judgments in all sorts of different jurisdictions.

    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    Article 24 preempts only accident cases.

    This was not a case in which--

    So, your answer is yes, that's... that's a result and too bad. 
    But, you know, I'm not inclined to interpret it that way if I'm dealing with... with a phrase that is... is merely ambiguous, in the cases covered by article 17. 
    Does that mean in the cases in which article 17 gives relief, or does it mean in... in the cases... in the cases in which... which article 17 addresses?
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="1866.369" stopTime="1896.249">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    --I think the cases in which article 17 addresses. 
    And the cases which article 17 addresses are cases which are resulting from accidents. 
    It's so stated very explicitly in article 17. 
    Counsel, I believe, has admitted in response to Your Honor's question that she is... agrees that this case does not involve an accident. 
    This case does not involve an accident. 
    That's also assumed by the questions presented for review.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1896.249" stopTime="1910.319">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, sure, but why can't I say that article 17... what it addresses is damage sustained in the event of death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger? 
    That, it seems to me, is the general subject of 17.
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="1910.319" stopTime="1917.122">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    Except that's only true if the accident that caused the damage took place on board an aircraft in the course and so on.

    But that's... that's... that's... that modifies the entire first sentence and first clause of article 17 because the first clause says that it shall be liable for damages sustained for bodily injury if the accident which caused the damage. 
    So, the existence of an accident is critical under the Saks case, and under... under... under all of these cases, it's a critical element.

    Article 17 predicated liability for death or wounding or bodily injury only if there was an accident.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's right, but it also... it also only predicated liability for death or wounding or other bodily injury. 
    So, you could say it's only limited to that too. 
    So, if it isn't death, wounding, or bodily injury, if it's just... just psychic injury, even in the event of an accident, you can sue under State law.

    And the brief amicus of the Solicitor General, which I would recommend to this Court as a good text for this subject matter... in the Solicitor General's brief they emphasized the importance and the critical necessity that there first be an accident, and an accident is defined as something which is unforeseen, which is--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --Let me ask you about... because I've now seen the whole treaty, as Justice Thomas had the... if you look at the treaty as a whole... and I think this is what the English court was doing... it's saying, look, there's one section here, section 3, which says, airlines, you cannot limit your liability in a contract and you give that up. 
    And then section 4 says, but in return for that, you're going to be liable in the following ways, and then it lists a whole bunch of them with qualifications. 
    And in that context, all that article 24 meant was it meant to refer to the three kinds of liabilities or situations you may have, to people, to luggage, and for delay.
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="2524.322" stopTime="2525.143">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    Yes.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2525.143" stopTime="2593.160">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And that's all it meant. 
    And if you don't read it that way, you get into a terrible mess. 
    You get into the mess, for example, that a flight attendant who hits somebody in the face and she says it was an accident or the... the passenger says, no, no, she did it on purpose, or... or you have somebody suing in a State court because the air that's recirculated has germs in it and they know that the germs will, in fact, give colds to a certain percentage of people, or they serve coffee that's too hot and they know that a certain percentage of people are going to get sore throats because the coffee is too hot. 
    I mean, there could be millions of cases, and you're very... you know, the bar is very imaginative, and they'll find terrific cases. 
    [Laughter] 
    And so our choice is you either read it vaguely to just refer to passengers, luggage, and delay, or you read it precisely by the language and we get into the situation with your case and many such others are allowed. 
    But the English court says, that's the choice. 
    We think really the language isn't perfect, but you... they took that choice. 
    So, now, what is your... your... your response?
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="2593.160" stopTime="2641.102">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    My view on the Abnett case, or the English case, the House of Lords case, is that the House of Lords case did not deal with the kind of willful problem that we have in my case. 
    The House of Lords was dealing with a situation which was completely accidental to the airline and it was... it was a breach of contract of passage or negligence in landing in Kuwait at the time that the plane did land in Kuwait, but it did not deal at all with the kind of common law tort... willful torts, that we have in this case. 
    It just wasn't dealing with it. 
    So, the English court can go ahead and say whatever it wants with respect to the kind of cases that they were dealing with, but the fact problem before that court is totally different from the fact problem before this Court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2641.102" stopTime="2658.684">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Oh, but there's no doubt at all in reading that opinion that, faced with this case, they would have come out the same way. 
    There's... I mean, that's how they construed the treaty is to be an overall... overarching purpose to govern exclusively liability of international air.
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="2658.684" stopTime="2712.299">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    My only answer to that would be that the treaty governs what it governs, and the treaty... the language of the treaty spells out what it does govern. 
    It's true that the treaty could govern an intentional wrongdoing such as we have in my case, but it doesn't. 
    It uses the word accident deliberately and it uses the word event or occurrence in article 18 in a deliberate way as this Court pointed out in the Saks case. 
    I do not see anything in the treaty which anywhere near... comes near to governing this case. 
    It's certainly not an accident. 
    The very question before this Court right now, which... upon which the Court granted certiorari, the very question is assuming this is not an accident, if it's not an accident, then is it covered? 
    So, we can't assume that it's covered in any way by article 17.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2712.299" stopTime="2765.096">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That was the same assumption that the House of Lords made, and I think that they felt a certain discomfort in that too because they said, we have to take this case on the basis that it was no accident. 
    It wasn't an accident, and so then what follows? 
    You keep characterizing this as an intentional tort and clearly not an accident, and yet not only... was it Judge Gleason? 
    There was another earlier case involving a misfired security check, and district judges said, yes, that sounds like an accident to us. 
    They went through their routine security procedure. 
    They... it misfired in this case. 
    The profile indicated the wrong person. 
    Why is it so clear that that isn't an accident, that picking... going through the normal procedures but having the procedure misfire isn't an accident?
speaker="robert_h_silk" startTime="2765.096" stopTime="2803.491">
    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    But this procedure in my case did not misfire. 
    The procedure in my case went precisely the way it was intended. 
    It was a routine. 
    It was intended. 
    It was a security check. 
    And I will say that the airline had a right to conduct the security check. 
    They had a right to do it, but they didn't have a right to do it without the consent of my client. 
    And without the consent of my client, just as a doctor has a right to perform surgery, he doesn't have a right to do it without the consent of his patient, the airline here did not have a right to conduct a security check without the consent of my client. 
    If my client didn't want to consent, then my client would have been barred from boarding the plane by the Federal regulations.

    Does the airline dispute that?

    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    No. 
    The airline does not dispute anything at all. 
    The issues in this case are free of factual problems or factual complications. 
    The airline does not dispute it. 
    The... in... in my... in the respondent's brief, in the statement of the case, it was pointed out... the testimony was even gone through, I believe, verbatim as part of the... of the statement of... of the case. 
    And it pointed out that my client didn't consent. 
    She wasn't asked to consent. 
    She was overwhelmed and so on by the authority which was exhibited by the security people, and they didn't ask her consent. 
    The Federal regulation says that if she doesn't consent, then she cannot board the plane. 
    All the security problems are taken care of.

    And the trial judge said, you don't need to do it because if the only problem is psychic, it's being dismissed under Floyd. 
    And I said, but... and I argued there that... that this was not an accident and Floyd applies only to accidents under article 17, and the judge said, yes, it was an accident because she turned out not to be a terrorist.

    Does in the cases covered by mean in those cases where there is liability under or does it mean in the universe of situations envisioned by?

    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    I... I would like to suggest, if I may, that article 17 is a liability provision. 
    It is dealing with liability. 
    Its whole focus is liability. 
    Its focus is not just passengers.

    And the Saks case points out the very important difference of language between article 17 and article 18, and in Saks and also... not only in Saks, but the Solicitor General and the Solicitor General's brief amicus in the Saks case. 
    It writes practically a textbook on this subject in which he points out the difference between the usage of... of the word for occurrence in article 18, the French word for occurrence in article 18, and the French word for accident in Article 17. 
    They make a world of difference.

    Mr. Robert H. Silk 
    Well, it's clearly new because in article 24 as it was, it says, in cases covered by article 17. 
    Now, article 24 under the Montreal Protocol says, in the carriage of passengers and baggage, any action for damage, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions of this... of this convention.

    I... I believe so because the Government in this case has been arguing that this is some kind of an accident, and accident can be broadly interpreted.

   Rebuttal of Diane W. Wilson

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Ms. Wilson, you have a little more than a minute remaining.
speaker="diane_w_wilson" startTime="3435.485" stopTime="3490.852">
    Ms. Diane W. Wilson 
    Your Honors, I would just like to make two brief points. 
    One is that the court below specifically found that there was no willful misconduct in this case, and that's referenced at page 27 of the appendix to the petition. 
    And also that accident can encompass intentional torts. 
    That's what article 25 can look to. 
    It is only if you have willful misconduct that you get an unlimited recovery. 
    Accident wasn't ever meant to mean unintended. 
    I also would note that you should meet the terms and conditions of article 25. 
    You have to meet the terms and conditions of article 24. 
    There is a symmetry there. 
    And with respect to the issue of article 18, I believe that the fact that the liability is broader in scope with respect to baggage and cargo should not mean that if... where you have a narrower scope of liability under the convention, you then get to get recovery outside of the convention. 
    Thank you.
