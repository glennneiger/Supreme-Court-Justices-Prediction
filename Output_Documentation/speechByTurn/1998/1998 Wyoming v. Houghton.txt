Wyoming v. Houghton
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="104.688">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case is Wyoming against Houghton 98-184. 
    During a routine traffic stop, a Wyoming Highway Patrol officer noticed a hypodermic syringe in the driver's shirt pocket. 
    With refreshing candor, the driver admitted that he used the syringe to take drugs. 
    On the basis of that statement the officer ordered the driver and his two women passengers including respondent out of the car, while he searched the vehicle for contraband. 
    One of the items he searched was respondent's purse sitting on the backseat. 
    Inside the purse he found drugs and drug paraphernalia. 
    Respondent was convicted on drug possession charges, but the Wyoming Supreme Court reversed her conviction, holding that the search of the purse violated the Fourth Amendment because the officer didn't have probable cause to believe the respondent or a person particular was concealing contraband. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today and authored by Justice Scalia, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Wyoming. 
    Probable cause to search a car extends all containers in the car capable of concealing the object of the search. 
    In previous cases we have held it is reasonable to conduct a warrant less search of a car that police have probable cause to believe contains contraband and that search may extend all containers within the car capable of holding the contraband. 
    The historical understanding of the Fourth Amendment of those cases rely on does not admit of the distinction based upon ownership of the contraband. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion and Justice Stevens joined by Justices Ginsburg and Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.
