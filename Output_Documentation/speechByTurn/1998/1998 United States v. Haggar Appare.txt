    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This case arises from a refund proceedings for duties imposed on men's garments that were shipped by the respondent to this country from an assembly plant that it controlled in Mexico. 
    What happens is that, this manufacturer was attempting to use Mexican plants for assembly purposes. 
    It shipped pre-cut fabrics to the plant in Mexico with threads, buttons, and zippers and they were assembled there. 
    If that had been all, they would have been entitled to a duty exemption without question. 
    But the fabric had been pretreated with a chemical and when the chemical is subjected to heat, it then puts the permapress in the garments and the baking and the heating was also done in Mexico and the question is whether or not this is incidental to assembly or not? 
    The respondent sought to permapress the garments in order to maintain their creases, of course. 
    To accomplish this, they baked the chemically pretreated garments at the Mexican plant. 
    The statute on which the respondent relies does provide a partial exemption from duties, otherwise imposed if the articles assembled abroad. 
    I have not been improved in condition except by being assembled or by being subjected to operations incidental to the assembly process. 
    The custom service claimed that the baking was an added process in addition to assembly and it denied the duty exemption. 
    Respondent's cases made more difficult by a regulation adopted by the Commissioner of Customs that deems all permapress in operations not incidental to the assembly process. 
    The respondent brought suit for refund in the Court of International Trade. 
    The Court declined to treat the regulation as controlling and it ruled in favor of the respondent. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed; it also declined to give the regulations deference. 
    Contrary to the position of that Court and the Court of Appeals, we hold the regulation in question is subject to the analysis required by Chevron, USA and that if it is a reasonable regulation and implementation of an ambiguous statutory provision, it must be given judicial deference. 
    The statutory scheme does not support the respondent's contention that the regulation is limited in application to customs officers themselves and is not intended to govern the adjudications of importers' refund suits. 
    In addition, nothing in the regulation in question persuade us that the agency intended the regulation to have some lesser force and effect. 
    We also reject the argument that various statutes empower the Court of International Trade to interpret the tariff statute without giving Chevron deference to the regulations. 
    We declined to reach the question whether the regulation in question does need the preconditions for Chevron deference. 
    Respondent's various arguments in this respect are best addressed in the first instance to the courts below. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Ginsburg joins.
