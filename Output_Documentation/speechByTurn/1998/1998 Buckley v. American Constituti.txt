    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-930, Victoria Buckley v. The American Constitutional Law Foundation. 
    General Norton.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="10.929" stopTime="60.711">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Colorado views the initiative process as an essential part of our law making function. 
    The right of initiative is the first section under the Colorado constitution under the heading, Legislative Department. 
    Because this is an important process to State government we have established a limited structure of regulation intended to safeguard the people's right to democratic self government while ensuring the fairness of our election process. 
    Beyond the two viewpoints represented in the courtroom today, there are two other important interests that are protected through our regulatory process. 
    The first is the interest of those who may oppose an initiative, and the second is the interest of the signers of the petition.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    May I ask just one factual question?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="63.602" stopTime="63.913">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="63.913" stopTime="70.986">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I understand there's a final reporting requirement, a disclosure requirement, and that is not challenged here.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="70.986" stopTime="84.647">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    That is correct. 
    It is the reports that deal with the monthly reporting requirement as to the individual petition circulators.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="84.647" stopTime="107.090">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, does the financial disclosure that's made at the end, and it's not challenged, separate out the amount that's paid for solicitors, so if I read the report I know that they spent X dollars for TV advertising and Y dollars for... to pay circulators? 
    Do I... can I find that out from the final report?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="107.090" stopTime="114.717">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    The final report would list all of the expenditures included among the expenditures of the sponsoring campaign committee--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="114.717" stopTime="116.668">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    What I'm asking, is it a lump sum, or is it separated out?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="116.668" stopTime="118.227">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --It is separated out in detail.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="118.227" stopTime="123.402">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And when is that final report due? 
    Is that before the election or after?

    Ms. Gale Norton 
    I'm not sure, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="126.395" stopTime="133.348">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It would also show the amounts that went to the individual petition circulators?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="133.348" stopTime="134.349">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    That is correct.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --that may be filed with the petition when the petition is completed? 
    Isn't that when that report gets filed? 
    I thought the monthly reports were while the petition was in circulation.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="147.098" stopTime="149.509">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    The monthly reports are while it is in circulation.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="149.509" stopTime="161.277">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But when the completed petition is there, and the sponsor says, we have enough votes, at that time the so called final report would go in?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="161.277" stopTime="165.079">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Your Honor, I'm not sure what the due date is for the final report.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="165.079" stopTime="177.528">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is there anything in the monthly disclosure statements that break it down expenditure by expenditure, so if I looked at the monthly disclosure statement, could I see how much was paid just for circulating?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="177.528" stopTime="185.012">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    The monthly disclosure statement lists the amounts that are paid to each individual circulator on a person by person basis.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="185.012" stopTime="189.756">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    That was struck down. 
    Has anything in the monthly disclosure statement been allowed to stand--

    Ms. Gale Norton 
    The--

    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --What has been struck down is simply the amount that applies to individual circulators.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="198.022" stopTime="204.216">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right. 
    In that monthly disclosure statement, so far as the statute has been allowed to stand--
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="204.216" stopTime="204.627">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="204.627" stopTime="208.741">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --can I see how much is paid, lump sum, for circulation?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="208.741" stopTime="213.543">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    You would have to add up the amount that is paid to each individual circulator.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="213.543" stopTime="215.947">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, except that's been struck down. 
    Okay.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="215.947" stopTime="235.999">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Signature gathering serves the same function as a primary election in a candidate selection process. 
    By obtaining the requisite 54,242 signatures, an initiative's backers establish that it has a significant modicum of support.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="235.999" stopTime="260.848">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, there's this difference between signature gathering and a primary election. 
    In a primary election it is not somebody trying to persuade somebody else. 
    Signature gathering may perform that function, but it is, in addition, and perhaps primarily, one citizen trying to persuade another citizen about the merits of a particular legislature proposal.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="260.848" stopTime="284.880">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Here, there are three functions that all occur simultaneously. 
    That is the aspect of persuasiveness, as you have described. 
    There is also a role that the circulator plays of an administrative function akin to an election judge, and there is also the function of acting as an agent or fiduciary for the signer in fulfilling responsibilities as to the signer.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="284.880" stopTime="298.471">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, do... is there any way of telling from this record whether the typical petitioner circulator goes door to door, or sits in a shopping mall? 
    I suppose they do both.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="298.471" stopTime="309.206">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    They may do both. 
    The practice is ordinarily to go to a shopping mall or some place where there are many people gathered. 
    The--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="309.206" stopTime="310.378">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And so--
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="310.378" stopTime="314.620">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --record does not specifically describe that in the trial court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="314.620" stopTime="323.576">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --What is the interest of the State that you say supports the requirement that the circulators have to be registered voters?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="323.576" stopTime="339.267">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    That is two part. 
    First of all, is because they are fulfilling a law making function, we as a State should be able to say that those who are fulfilling that function should be people who are committed to--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="339.267" stopTime="362.853">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In light of Meyer, I would have thought the State would have a hard time asserting that its interest in having them be registered voters can prevail. 
    No doubt there are people in the State who are not registered voters, but who nonetheless would like to serve as petition circulators and debate the merits of given issues.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="362.853" stopTime="382.296">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --We are happy to have people debate the merits and to enter into a persuasive function. 
    It is only when they perform the administrative election judge type functions of ensuring that those who are signing the petition are who they say they are, that a husband is not signing for a wife--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="382.296" stopTime="382.624">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="382.624" stopTime="393.272">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, why can't somebody who is a resident of Colorado, who's an adult resident, perform that function just as well as somebody who's a registered voter? 
    I just don't understand.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="393.272" stopTime="445.376">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --The registration requirement is different from a residency requirement in that it requires a person to swear an oath that they are a resident of the State before they begin the circulating process. 
    There is a requirement that they do so at the end of the circulating process as part of the affidavit if registration and residency are separated. 
    But here, we have an assurance all the way through the process that they're going to be here. 
    It ties in with the second justification for that, and that is in preventing fraud. 
    We have had the problem of people who come to the State simply to circulate petitions. 
    If those people are not going to be around several months later when we actually go through the process of having an administrative hearing to--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="445.376" stopTime="452.432">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, but you require an affidavit at the end of the day, when the petition is filed, that the circulator is, in fact, a resident.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="452.432" stopTime="455.213">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --That is ordinarily our process--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="455.213" stopTime="471.145">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you have the normal criminal laws that could enforce that, so it's very difficult for me to understand, in the face of Meyer, what State justification you can offer for also requiring that the circulator be a registered voter.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="471.145" stopTime="479.289">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --This would ensure that they are a resident throughout the entire time that they are circulating the petition, rather than just at the moment they submit--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="479.289" stopTime="480.401">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why isn't that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="480.401" stopTime="489.688">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Isn't there something in the record that suggests that it's easier to determine whether someone is a registered voter than it is to determine whether they're a resident?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="489.688" stopTime="501.074">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --We have specific lists of registered voters. 
    We do not have lists of people who are otherwise residents. 
    It gives us a concrete place to answer that question.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="501.074" stopTime="519.917">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is it any part of your rationale on the registered voters that if you don't want to count yourself in the political community by not voting, you shouldn't take part in this, or is it simply a kind of way of verifying that the person is, indeed, a resident?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="519.917" stopTime="562.387">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    It is a way of verifying that a person is, indeed, a resident, and that is correct, but it is also... there's also two parts. 
    To the extent that someone is playing a formal role in the process, which they are doing, we would require that they be registered voters in a way as part of being committed to the Colorado law making process, just as we require our legislators to be committed, just as we require election judges and those who participate in nominating conventions to be registered voters. 
    If they want to participate in the purely advocacy function, to stand next to someone who is a registered voter, they are perfectly free to do that and to act as advocates.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="562.387" stopTime="592.757">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    How do you get around the fact that, despite the complexity of function, and I will concede to you that they are performing functions in the electoral process, how do you get around the fact that Meyer says they're also engaging in core speech, and if they're engaging in core speech, they're going to be... your restrictions are going to be judged on a very restrictive standard. 
    How do you get around Meyer in that respect?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="592.757" stopTime="601.243">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    We believe that, even under a strict scrutiny analysis, that our laws would satisfy that strict scrutiny.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="601.243" stopTime="624.487">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is that? 
    Let's talk about... why is it easier to prevent fraud somehow when you're dealing with a resident than with a nonresident? 
    You think Coloradans are more honest than non Coloradans? 
    [Laughter] 
    Is that the rationale?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="624.487" stopTime="658.731">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Well, we would like to think so. 
    Our rationale is being able to find people. 
    If someone is a registered voter, they have taken an oath saying that they are a resident. 
    That gives us some assurance that they may be around when questions arise. 
    Someone may seek a signature. 
    It may be 6 months later, at the time an administrative hearing is held to inquire into questions abut the validity of that signature, and if those people have left the State, we cannot subpoena--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="658.731" stopTime="669.738">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, do you think registered voters are more apt to leave the State than people who haven't registered? 
    I mean, are less apt to leave the State than people who haven't registered? 
    Is there any statistic to show which ones, which segment of the population is more mobile than the other?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="669.738" stopTime="689.201">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --To the extent that we are dealing with the problem of... that is described in the amicus briefs of the State and Local Legal Center and of the States, we are seeing the development of bands of people who go from State to State simply to circulate petitions, and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="689.201" stopTime="698.615">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And don't they have to provide you with their... you could require them to provide you with their name and address so that even though they're itinerant you can still... you know, you can find who they were.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="698.615" stopTime="707.232">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --We may know that they live in California, but we cannot subpoena them in California and we cannot prosecute them for having engaged in fraud.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="707.232" stopTime="710.764">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Have you ever prosecuted any petition gatherer?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="710.764" stopTime="725.603">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Yes, we have. 
    In the record it shows the 1992 cycle, in which we successfully prosecuted three people for forgery. 
    We attempted to prosecute three others, but were not able to serve the warrant because they had left the State.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="725.603" stopTime="728.505">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Were these gatherers or signers?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="728.505" stopTime="729.587">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    These were gatherers.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="729.587" stopTime="739.884">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    I'll grant you it would be easier if you didn't have to go to California, but I mean, if the fraud is serious you can start an extradition proceeding, can't you?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="739.884" stopTime="744.587">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    We were not able to, as a practical matter, do that in this situation.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="744.587" stopTime="747.239">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why, because it cost too much money?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="747.239" stopTime="763.330">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    It would have... we had a problem with our... because it is a misdemeanor in some situations, we would not be able to do that. 
    In other situations it was trying to serve warrants. 
    We were not able to do that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="763.330" stopTime="770.343">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the only justification for the registration requirement you've given us is that it's easier to find their address if they're registered. 
    Right?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="770.343" stopTime="779.990">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    No. 
    It's twofold. 
    It's also our interest as a State in having people who participate in our law making process be citizens and registered voters.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="779.990" stopTime="785.356">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you can require that they be residents without requiring that they be registered voters.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="785.356" stopTime="791.190">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    We could have a process that would require them to swear an oath saying that they--

    That is correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    How many of these people are we talking about? 
    How much of a burden is that on the State that you save by simply going to the registration book?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose that it were shown that in most cases in Colorado initiatives were circulated by paid solicitors who didn't really care which side they were on, they were just doing it to get the pay, they'd circulate a petition on either side of any issue. 
    Suppose that were the fact most of the time. 
    Would that undermine the rationale of our recent opinion in Meyers? 
    It was unanimous opinion. 
    It was recent. 
    I doubt that we would want to revisit it. 
    I noticed in your brief that you seem to be questioning the rationale that core speech does take place at the in it... at the signature gathering stage.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="929.981" stopTime="948.856">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    The Burdick approach that we would urge the Court to adopt recognizes that there is both core speech aspect, where there would be a severe burden on that speech, potentially, and the ability of the States to have a regulatory process.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="948.856" stopTime="973.950">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Burdick was in the context of a primary election, with rules about parties and so forth, and the assumption of Meyers was that a core speech function, a very viable speech function in the initiative process takes place at the signature gathering stage, so that it's not analogous to the candidate qualifying thing, and I'm asking if you think that distinction holds.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="973.950" stopTime="990.053">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    Meyer, I believe, did not adequately recognize the other aspects of the process. 
    It focused on the core speech part, which was truly at issue in Meyer, and did not look at the other issues of the State in--

    How much do we actually know about this, or how much did we know about it in Meyer? 
    You know, if, in fact, someone sits at a shopping center and waits for people to come up to them, and they're anxious to get as many signatures as they can, one would suspect that there's not much debate. 
    If someone is going to say, I don't like that proposition, the petition circulator just says, okay, go on. 
    I want someone who will sign.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="1040.529" stopTime="1060.571">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    We believe the State and Local Government Center in its brief has presented a fairly accurate view of what the transaction ordinarily looks like. 
    It is an attempt to get as many people through to just sign, rather than going through an extensive process of explaining the petition.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1060.571" stopTime="1074.171">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why does the State insist that the circulator have to have the circulator's name on a badge, as opposed to just saying, volunteer, or paid circulator?

    Ms. Gale Norton 
    That is to address the problem that we have of trying to maintain the integrity of the process as it is going along. 
    If the Secretary of State's office receives a phone call that says, I saw a petition circulator paying people to sign petitions, which is clearly a violation of State law, we get a call that says, it was a man with brown hair standing at the corner of Sixth and Broadway, at that point in time, we don't have any petitions.

    I mean, you know from the petition who were the signers of that particular petition. 
    The person is required to identify the sponsor, and that that person is paid or volunteer.

    If... I just have one question I'd like to ask, which is that if... I assume... I'll assume for argument's sake that you're right, that there's an aspect in which this petition gatherer is like a voting official who sits in a booth, so the State can regulate, but that petition gatherer is also a person who's likely to try to persuade someone to sign the petition, and to that extent there's speech involved, persuasive political speech, so if I think there's both, what standard do I apply, and which case do you look to to give me the right standard? 
    In other words, I think there's a lot of speech involved, but I also think it's pretty important that the State can regulate its process for making laws. 
    Now... so I think both, and so since I think both, what case do I look to?

    It seems to me it's quite a different issue how many votes you need to get. 
    That doesn't involve core political speech. 
    We're talking about persuading people to sign, as opposed to how many people need to sign, and you think the two questions have to be equated.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2023.140" stopTime="2040.720">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That is very different. 
    I would think one goes to the procedure involved in making this change, and the other goes to the question of one citizen trying to get another one to sign up or to support a particular proposition. 
    You don't see a fundamental difference between those two?

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    --I was asked that question. 
    I'm giving you an answer. 
    My answer is no, but for purposes of this case, that other issue is not before us. 
    We are dealing with core political speech, Justice Scalia, and I believe that the process is adequately delineated in footnote 4 of the Meyer decision.

    --What about the requirement in most States that there's certain qualifications for circulating nominating petitions. 
    There's the person who goes door to door, and you have to have so many signatures to get on the ballot. 
    Now, is that circulator engaging in core political speech, in your view?
speaker="neil_d_otoole" startTime="2080.978" stopTime="2093.607">
    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    Not to the same extent, because he's proceeding with... I think this Court has consistently drawn a distinction between ballot initiative, where there's a discussion of issues and a discussion of candidates.

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    --Well, the State's interest differs, because under the State... in the State of Colorado, Chief Justice, we have a situation where the people reserve to themselves the right to petition or circulate a citizen's initiative and, in fact, the State's involvement does not occur until that petition itself is submitted to the Secretary of State for approval of the measure in terms of being placed on the ballot.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2135.791" stopTime="2148.190">

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    Because the State... Chief Justice, the State's interest in curtailing debate and consideration and discussion is significantly less in the former than in the latter.

    That's at least what they're saying, and it's not implausible. 
    Now, if that's a legitimate interest, and it sounds like one, but I agree with you that this is unconstitutional, would I also have to hold unconstitutional an effort by a State to say, we want disclosed how much money you give to a candidate? 
    In other words, I'm quite concerned about deciding for you in this case and then finding the campaign finance issue before me in another case and suddenly, lo and behold, I've decided that issue here.

    And what they're worried about, I take it, in Colorado is a paid petition gatherer will say, I'll pay you 50 cents if you write your name down, which I take it is illegal, and they want a ready method to see if that's happened, and this is their ready method, and that justification's--

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole

    Suppose I think in this case that their justification is trying to catch petition gatherers who will pay for signatures. 
    Now... and I agree with you, suppose I agree with you that despite that justification this is unconstitutional. 
    Then, in the next case, someone says, remember that case you just decided? 
    Now, the State here is requiring various kinds of disclosure of contributions to candidates or other forms of finance disclosure.

    The State... one of the important State interests here is to catch the people who are bribing people to sign petitions, and there's sort of a presumption that paid circulators may do that rather often. 
    Does the record contain any evidence indicating how... what percentage of paid circulators engage in this kind of conduct and what percentage don't? 
    I mean, normally we presume people are innocent until they're proved guilty, but here there's kind of a presumption that paid circulators are guilty of this recurring crime.

    The State detected approximately 2,000 of those signatures obtained by fraud. 
    That's a fifth of a percent, or less than a fifth of a percent.

    There's evidence also in this case that in one such incident the proponent had paid somebody approximately for 6,000 more signatures than they actually got, and they thought they defrauded--

    So you only have to show what company you paid it to, and these are employees of that company.

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    Employees... they... they're paid on a per signature basis under our law in the State of Colorado. 
    They'd be independent contractors. 
    The answer to that question is--

    The same day?

    The same day.

    But this disclosure, this global disclosure, with the lump sum amount paid for circulation, is filed at the time the petitions are filed?

    No, but is it... is any issue about those disclosures--

    Mr. Neil D. O'Toole 
    --No, Your Honor, there is not. 
    The only issue in that disclosure is the requirement that while the petition is being circulated, while that contentious issue is before the public, these individuals, who by virtue of the sole fact that they are paid, have to be identified. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Gale Norton

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Thank you, Mr. O'Toole. 
    General Gale, you have 1 minute remaining.

    Ms. Gale Norton 
    May it please the Court, in clarification to Justice Kennedy's question, the monthly report was stricken by the Tenth Circuit in its entirety. 
    The final report was stricken to the extent it requires individualized reporting regarding the circulators. 
    Mr. O'Toole is correct that the final report is submitted at the time that the petition itself is submitted. 
    There are examples of both of those reports in the joint appendix at pages 41 and 45. 
    The State has an interest in preventing fraud and misconduct while a petition is being circulated, not simply bribery, but also a husband signing for a wife, something as commonplace as that. 
    We have the responsibility to the--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the State doesn't care about this, these things with candidate petitions?
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="3645.164" stopTime="3647.755">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --Certainly the State does care about these things.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3647.755" stopTime="3649.208">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But it doesn't have these requirements.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="3649.208" stopTime="3651.479">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    It has some of these requirements as--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3651.479" stopTime="3657.602">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Not the badge and the paid versus the unpaid and the requirements we're talking about here.
speaker="gale_norton" startTime="3657.602" stopTime="3686.312">
    Ms. Gale Norton 
    --That is correct. 
    It does have the registration requirement, but not the others. 
    The badge requirement fulfills the function of providing information to the signer. 
    That person is essentially relying on the circulator as a fiduciary. 
    The person can... the voter can only sign a petition once. 
    Once they have signed a petition, they cannot sign that same petition again, and so once they have given over their signature to that person, they have given them a trust responsibility.
