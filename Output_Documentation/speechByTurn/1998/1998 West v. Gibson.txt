    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Since 1972 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act has forbidden government employers to discriminate on the basis of race or color, religion, gender, national origin. 
    The Act provides a remedial system so in the case of the government employee, who think he has been discriminated against, that employee first have to bring a complaint to the department that employs in and then if he wants, he can go to the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission and from there or if he doesn't want he can go directly to Federal Court. 
    The Act gives to the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, the power to provide "appropriate remedy". 
    Now, before 1991 the Act itself contained only equitable remedies such as reinstatement in backpay did not include legal remedies like compensatory damages. 
    But in 1991 Congress amended the Act, so that it would say that a complaining party "may recover compensatory damages" in an action brought under the Civil Rights Act. 
    Now, obviously that amendment allows the government employee to go get compensatory damages in a court action. 
    But does it also permit the employee to obtain compensatory damages from the EEOC, if he goes there first perhaps on his way to court? 
    We conclude that the law as amended in 1991 does permit the EEOC to avoid compensatory damages. 
    Remember as I just said that Title VII gives the EEOC the power to provide "appropriate remedy". 
    Now, before the amendment that term probably did not include compensatory damages because the Act like Title VII itself only provided equitable remedies, but after the amendment, in our view, compensatory damages became appropriate. 
    As we explained our interpretation of the statutory languages consistent with that language and our interpretation furthers Congress' remedial purpose because it encourages the use of less expensive administrative remedies, rather than requiring more expensive court actions in order to get the compensatory damages. 
    We find nothing in the law's legislative history that would favor any contrary interpretation and despite certain language in the amendment that does make the matter less than absolutely clear. 
    We believe it is clear enough to satisfy any special clarity requirement that is imposed by the fact that this might be involving a waiver of sovereign immunity. 
    We reverse a contrary Court of Appeals holding and we remand the case for consideration of other issues. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas have joined.
