Hanlon v. Berger

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case I have to announce is No. 97-1927, Hanlon against Berger which is the companion case to Wilson against Layne. 
    In this case agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service search the ranch and its outbuildings. 
    While accompanied by a CNN camera crew. 
    This case, it raises the same issues as Wilson against Layne does. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the agents violated the clearly established Fourth Amendment rights of the homeowners. 
    Under our holding today in Wilson that right was not clearly established at the time of this search which was also in the early part of the 90s. 
    The agents are therefore entitled to qualify the immunity and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
