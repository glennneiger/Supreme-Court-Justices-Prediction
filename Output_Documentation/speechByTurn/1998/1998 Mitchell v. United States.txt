    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinions of the Court to announce in three cases. 
    The first is 97-7541, Amanda Mitchell versus United States. 
    Now, the petitioner Amanda Mitchell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, but reserve the right to contest the amount of drugs attributable to her at sentencing. 
    The sentencing hearing witnesses for the government testified that the amounts of drugs were substantial and Mitchell distributed this without taking the stand to testify. 
    The District Court ruled that is a consequence of her guilty plea. 
    Mitchell had no rights to remain silent with respect to the details of her crimes. 
    In imposing a 10-year sentence the judge told Mitchell that he held it against her but she did not come forward and explained her side of the dispute. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the sentence and held it by pleading guilty to the offense Mitchell have waived her Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    In an opinion authored by Justice Kennedy we hold that a guilty plea is not a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the sentencing. 
    It is well-established that a witness in a single proceeding may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the privilege against self-incrimination when questioned about the details. 
    That is because a witness cannot pick and choose what aspects of a particular subject to discuss without casting doubt on the trustworthiness of the statement. 
    The concerns which justify requiring the defendant to undergo cross-examination when he or she testifies are absent at a plea colloquy, however. 
    Instead of presenting testimony that puts facts into dispute the defendant who pleads guilty takes matters out of dispute often by confirming the prosecutions version of the facts. 
    Under these circumstances there is little danger that the court will be misled by selective disclosure, nor does the federal rule of Criminal Procedure 11 which governs pleas contemplate the broad waiver of the privilege. 
    Treating a guilty plea as a waiver of the privilege at sentencing would encroach on the rights of defendants. 
    Were we to accept the government’s position prosecutors could indict without specifying the quantity of drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea, and then put the defendant on the stand of sentencing to fill in the drug quantity. 
    We also hold that the District Court was not entitled based on Mitchell’s silence to draw an adverse inference with regard to the amount of drugs attributable to her. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which has been joined by Justice O’Connor, Justice Thomas, and me; Justice Thomas has also filed a dissenting opinion.
