    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Under the Social Security Act, survivors benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband covered by the Act are payable to his widow regardless of dependency. 
    But such benefits on the basis of a deceased wife covered by the Act, are payable to our widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from her. 
    In this case, a three-judge district court held that the different treatment of men and women so mandated constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees. 
    That judgment is affirmed. 
    Our affirmance is supported by two opinions. 
    I had filed one in which Justices White, Marshall and Powell have joined, Mr. Justice Stevens has filed the other, Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined.
