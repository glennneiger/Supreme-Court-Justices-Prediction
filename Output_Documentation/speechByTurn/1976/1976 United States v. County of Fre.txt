    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case comes to us on appeal from an Intermediate Appellate Court in the State of California. 
    It involves a validity of a state property tax on the possessory interest of those who occupied tax exempt property. 
    Among other things, the State levies a tax on the employees of the United States Forest Service who occupy houses in the forest that are furnished to them by the United States as part of their compensation. 
    The state has informative by which it calculates the rental value and levies a tax accordingly. 
    The tax was challenged as invading the historic community of the United States from state taxation. 
    The state courts sustained the tax and the United States brought the case here. 
    For the reasons that we have stated in an opinion on file with the Court, we affirmed the judgment of the California Court and sustained the state tax. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
