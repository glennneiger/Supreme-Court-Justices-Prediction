    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Under the program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and cooperating state agencies pursuant to the Food Stamp Act of 1964, certain low income households are entitled to purchase food coupons at a discount. 
    The price and eligible household must pay for foodstamps as determined and part by its income as defined in applicable federal and state regulations. 
    Under those regulations, the transportation allowance which appellee receives from the State of Iowa and uses to defray the cost of commuting to a nurseâ€™s training program is treated as income. 
    The questions presented on this appeal are whether those regulations are authorized by the statute, and if so, whether they are constitutional. 
    A three-judge district court sitting in the Southern District of Iowa held that the regulations were invalid. 
    For reasons stated and an opinion filed with the clerk, we unanimously reversed the decision of the District Court and held that the regulations are valid.
