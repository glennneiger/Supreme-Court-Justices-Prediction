    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In this case, responded was an untenured teacher and an employee of the Mt. Healthy Board of Education, the petitioner. 
    The respondent filed this action in United States District Court for the Souther District of Ohio and complained that the Board's failure to renew his employment contract was in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution because that decision had been motivated by the Board's disapproval of certain actions protected against state interference by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    The District Court found that it had jurisdiction under the general federal questions section, 28 USC 1331 and ruled that though a number of other incidents have been considered by the Board, the teacher was entitled to reinstatement with back pay because the First Amendment protected conduct have been a substantial factor and the words of the Court and it's decision not to rehire. 
    This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    For the reason set forth and an opinion filed with the clerk this morning, we conclude that respondent did state a cause of action adequate to his established jurisdiction under Section 1331. 
    But because the issue wasn't preserved on appeal, we express no view on the actual merits of either the theory apparently accepted by the courts below that responded had an implied constitutional cause of action under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, or the theory not to specifically addressed by those courts that he have an action under Section 1983. 
    Accepting without deciding that respondent's complaint states a good cause of action, we call -- we hold that the case must be returned to the lower courts for additional findings. 
    The finding that the First Amendment protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in a decision not to rehire does not necessarily imply that the teacher would have necessarily been rehired that the impermissible factor had not been considered because the First Amendment does not require that employee should be put in a more favorable position bu virtue of their exercise of First Amendment Rights. 
    We vacate and remand for determination by the lower courts of the question whether the Board would have decline to rehire the teacher quite apart from the protected conduct.
