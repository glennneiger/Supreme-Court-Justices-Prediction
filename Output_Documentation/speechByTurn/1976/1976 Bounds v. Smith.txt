    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The respondents who are inmates of the North Carolina State Prisons brought this action in the Federal District Court against the petitioner of the State Prison Administrators. 
    Respondents claim their rights of access to the Courts guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to assist them in preparing habeas corpus as civil rights actions by making available a source of legal knowledge such as law books or independent legal advisors. 
    The District Court, following a per curiam decision of this Court six years ago agreed and ordered the State to establish minimum prison law libraries. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    For reasons explained and an opinion filed today, we hold that the fundamental right of access to the Courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in preparation in filing a meaningful legal papers provide -- by providing with adequate law books or adequate assistant from persons trained in the law. 
    Accordingly, we affirm judgment below. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a consent -- a concurring statement. 
    The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have filed dissenting opinions.
