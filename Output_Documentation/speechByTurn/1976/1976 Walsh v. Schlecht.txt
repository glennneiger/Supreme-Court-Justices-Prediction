    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, the Supreme Court of Oregon held that the provision of a collective bargaining agreement between petitioner, a general contractor in the Oregon State Council of Carpenters requiring that the petitioner pay contributions to certain pension trust funds with respect to hours of carpentry work performed by employees of a non-signatory subcontractor, did violated ยง302(a)(1) of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    That section generally prohibits agreements of employers to pay money to any representative of their employees with certain exceptions and the Supreme Court held that this fell within one the exceptions we agreed and affirmed, Mr. Justice White dissents in his violate dissenting opinion.
