    Justice Byron R. White 
    The enterprise case is here from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    It involves a labor dispute arising out of the refusal of certain unionized steel cutters to install pre-fitted and pre-piped air-conditioning units at a construction site. 
    The steam fitters claimed that the -- that the use of these of air conditioners violated a provision of the collective bargaining contract. 
    The issue in the case is whether the work stoppage was a secondary boycott in an unfair labor practice under 8(b) -- 4(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    The National Labor Relations Board held that it was an unfair labor practice. 
    The Court of Appeal disagreed and set aside the order because we agree with the National Labor Relations Board rather than the Court of Appeals will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice Marshall had filed a dissenting opinion. 
    The opinion is also adjoined in substantial part by Mr. Justice Stewart who has also filed a dissenting opinion.
