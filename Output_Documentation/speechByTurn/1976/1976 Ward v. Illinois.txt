Ward v. Illinois
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="0.000" stopTime="72.307">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The other case I have, the -- the Ward case comes here from the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois. 
    That State sustained the constitutionality of the state obscenity law against claims that the law did not comply with the requirements of this Court's decision several years ago in Miller against California. 
    We granted -- we noted probable jurisdiction because -- because the -- the decision was in conflict with a decision of the federal three-judge court which had invalidated the statutes. 
    We affirmed, we agree with the Illinois Supreme Court that the statute is consistent with Miller. 
    We don't think it's either vague or overbroad, so we do affirmed with the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has also dissented with Justices Brennan, Stewart and Marshall have joined Mr. Justice Stevens.
