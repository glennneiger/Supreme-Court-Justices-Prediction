    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Organic Act of Guam which was enacted in 1950 does not authorized the Guam legislature to divest the United States District Court created by the Act of its jurisdiction granted by that Act to hear appeals from local Guam courts and to transfer that jurisdiction to a newly created Guam Supreme Court. 
    We affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Stevens joined.
