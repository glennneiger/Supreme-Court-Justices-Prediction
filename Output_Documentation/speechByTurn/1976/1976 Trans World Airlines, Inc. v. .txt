    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case arose under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 involves a claim by the respondent, Hardison, that his is former employer, Trans World Airlines, did not make the efforts required by the statute to accommodate his religious beliefs and practices, so that he cannot only work for TWA but also observe his Saturday Sabbath. 
    The District Court held that TWA had satisfied the statute. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held otherwise and rule that TWA could have but did not make further efforts to accommodate Hardison, and we granted certiorari. 
    And we now reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Our reasons for doing so are stated in the opinion. 
    The defendant filed today. Mr. Justice Marshall has dissented and Mr. Justice Brennan has joined him.
