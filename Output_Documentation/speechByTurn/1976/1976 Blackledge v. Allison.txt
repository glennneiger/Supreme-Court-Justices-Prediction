    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by way of writ of certiorari granted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The respondent, Gary Darrell Allison, an inmate of a North Carolina Penitentiary, petitioned to Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus. 
    The Court dismissed his petition without a hearing and the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that in the circumstances of this case, summary dismissal was improper. 
    We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    For the reason set out in detail in the Court's opinion, filed today with the clerk, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The Chief Justice concurs only in the judgment and Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
