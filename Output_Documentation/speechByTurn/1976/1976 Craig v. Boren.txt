    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    An Oklahoma statute, prohibits the sale of "nonintoxicating" 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 and the females under the age of 18. 
    A three judge District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma held that this did not constitute a gender-based discrimination that denied the male 18 to 20 years of age the equal protection of the law. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that Oklahoma's gender-based differential does constitute an invidious discrimination against males 18 to 20 years of age in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens while joining the Court's opinion have filed concurring opinions; Mr. Justice Blackmun joining over Part II-D of the Court's opinion has filed a separate concurrence statement; Mr. Justice Stewart has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissent and they have filed separate dissenting opinions.
