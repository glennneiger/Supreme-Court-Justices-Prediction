    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the Scarborough case is a case here on writ of certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The case involves the prosecution of a convicted felon for possessing firearms in violation of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits regarding the statutory of required nexus between the interstate commerce and the possession of the weapon. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the Government met its burden by proving a connection if it demonstrated that the firearm possessed by the felon had previously travelled in the interstate commerce. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we affirmed, both the tax and the legislative history of the statute evidenced a congressional intent to outlaw possession broadly and to require no more than the minimal nexus that the possessed firearms have travelled at some time in interstate commerce. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
