    Justice Byron R. White 
    This is case is here on appeal from a three-judge court in the Northern District of Illinois. 
    The case arose when an agency of the State sued to recover welfare payments that allegedly had been fraudulently received. 
    And in connection with that action, the property of the defendants was attached. 
    It was -- it was attached. 
    The defendants then sued in the Federal Court claiming the Attachment Act was unconstitutional and asking for an injunction. 
    The District Court, a three-judge court as I have said sustained that claim and also rejected the -- the State's view that the case should go back to the State Court and the federal claims be raised in the action pending there. 
    We reversed and for the reasons we have stated in the opinion filed for the Court, we hold that the District Court should have dismissed the action and remitted the federal plaintiffs to the State Court. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting statement and Mr. Justice Stevens had filed a dissenting opinion.
