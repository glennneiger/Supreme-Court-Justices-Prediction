    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In this case, the Secretary of the Army has appealed directly to this Court from an adverse judgement entered by a three-judge District Court sitting in the Eastern District of New York. 
    After World War II, Congress authorized retirement pay for non-regular military personnel with at least 20 years of service in the Reserves or National Guard. 
    However, those who had been in the Reserves before World War II were not eligible for benefits unless they perform service, performed active duty during war time. 
    Appellee is such a person. 
    He contends that he may not be denied benefits for which he is otherwise eligible, simply because he had pre-war service. 
    In the District Court, he argued that the statute violates the equal protection principle inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
    In this Court, he makes the additional argument that the statute should be construed as merely providing that his years of pre-war service must be ignored for the purpose of determining his eligibility. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we reject both arguments and unanimously reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
