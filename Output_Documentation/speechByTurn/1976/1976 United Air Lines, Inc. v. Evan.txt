    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The respondent in this case was employed by United Air Lines as a flight attendant in November 1966 through February 1968. 
    He was rehired in February of 1972. 
    Assuming as she alleges that her separation from employment in 1968 violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    The question presented by this case is whether the employer has committed a second violation of Title VII by refusing to credit her with seniority for any period prior to February of 1972 when she was rehired. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that United had violated the Act because its seniority system perpetuated the effects of past discrimination. 
    For reasons stated and an opinion filed with the clerk, we conclude that United's seniority system is neutral in operation. 
    We then reversed the contrary decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.
