    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Atlas Roofing and Frank Irey cases, two Courts of Appeals decided that the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act could be enforced by the administrative in position of civil crimes subject to judicial review, but at no stage subject to the intervention of a jury. 
    We affirm that those judgments, we owe to that to the Seventh Amendment which generally provides for jury trials and civil cases are not applicable to statutory enforcement proceedings. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the decision of these cases.
