    This case involves a New York State tax on the transfer of security under the law of what you understand is the ex-rated glory of the sale that is involved and takes place in New York that it takes place out of state. 
    The out of state exchanges and challenge the tax in New York Courts. 
    The New York Court of Appeals sustained the tax against a -- against the challenge that is based on a Commerce Clause.

    Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.
