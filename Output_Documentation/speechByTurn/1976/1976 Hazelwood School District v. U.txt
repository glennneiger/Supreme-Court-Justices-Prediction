    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    The litigation began in 1973 when the United States filed suit charging the Hazelwood School District in suburban St. Louis County, Missouri with having engaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in the employment of its teachers in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended. 
    The District Court found that Hazelwood had not engaged in such discrimination. 
    An important part of the District Court's reasoning was based on its view that the small number of Negroes employed by Hazelwood as teachers was of no value in proving that Hazelwood had discriminated on the basis of race because the percentage of Negro pupils in the school district was equally small. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and found that Hazelwood had engaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination. 
    This finding was largely based on statistical evidence introduced by the Government showing a comparison of the percentage of Negroes on Hazelwood's teaching staff with the percentage of teachers in the area who were Negroes rather than with the percentage of Negro pupils in the Hazelwood District. 
    The relatively small percentage of Negro teachers employed by Hazelwood when coupled with the Government's other proof led the Court of Appeals to direct a final judgment against Hazelwood. 
    In the opinion filed today with the clerk, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. 
    The Court of Appeals correctly held that the District Court's comparison of the percentage of Negro teachers to the percentage of Negro pupils in Hazelwood was inappropriate one. 
    But the Court of Appeals was in error in undertaking to make the proper statistical comparisons itself instead of leaving them in the first instance for evaluation by the District Court. 
    Statistical comparisons are an important source of proof in Title VII cases but statistical data ordinarily require careful analysis and refinement and their value as evidence in an employment discrimination case depends upon all the surrounding circumstances. 
    The opinion for the Court outlines in greater detail some of the questions arising from the Court of Appeals statistical analysis. 
    Questions at the District Court would have to deal with on remand. 
    Only after those questions are resolved, will there be an adequate foundation for determining whether the Hazelwood School District engaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in employment after the effective date of the federal law in 1972. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice White while joining the opinion of the Court have each filed concurring opinions and Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
