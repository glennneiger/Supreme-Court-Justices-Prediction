    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    (Inaudible) law indicates which comes here from the California state court, the petitioner was convicted in California state court on a misdemeanor charges selling obscene films. 
    As proposed of the evidence, the jury was instructed that it could consider the circumstances of production and dissemination of the material in assessing the social importance and thus, the ultimate obscenity of the material. 
    Petitioner in this Court challenges this instruction alleging that it unconstitutionally allowed the jury to consider conduct by persons other than the defendant in deciding whether the material was obscene. 
    He also contends that the instruction was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause because it was given pursuant to a state statute which went into effect after the offense was committed. 
    We reject both of these contentions and affirmed the conviction. 
    The circumstances of the materials production and dissemination are relevant to the obscene character, the material itself that are constitutionally admissible even if involving persons other than the defendant. 
    We also accept the view of the California Court of Appeals that state law authorized the use of such an instruction prior to the enactment of the statute relied upon by the petitioner. 
    There was, therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 
    Justice -- Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice -- Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.
