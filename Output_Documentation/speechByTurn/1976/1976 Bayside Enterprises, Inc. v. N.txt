    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In the second case, Bayside Enterprises versus National Labor Relations Board, we review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    The National Labor Relations Act does not cover agricultural laborers. 
    The question in this case, is whether certain truck drivers who haul poultry feed from their employer's feed mills to independent farms which are under contract with the employer to raise chickens owned by the employer, are agricultural laborers covered by the Act. 
    The Labor Board held that they were employees and ordered their employer to bargain with their union. 
    The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit enforced that order. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict with decisions of the Fifth and Ninth Circuit. 
    For reasons stated in the opinion filed with the clerk were unanimously hold that the drivers are not agricultural laborers and therefore affirmed the decision of the First Circuit.
