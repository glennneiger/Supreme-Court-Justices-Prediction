    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit. 
    The case arose when Gamble, a prisoner in the Texas Department of Correction has filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S. Code 1983 against the prison doctor, the prison warden, and the Director of the Department of Corrections. 
    He claimed that he was subjected to cruelty and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the prison's treatment of a back injury he sustained during prison work. 
    The District Court dismissed the complaint from failure to state the cause of action and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and ordered the claim reinstated. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we spelled out the guidelines for such complaints and we hold that in this case as in others, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment requires a prison be provided with medical care and that deliberative deliverance by prison personnel to a prisoner with such illness or injury violates the Eighth Amendment. 
    In the present case however, we find no such indifference by one of the petitioners, the doctor Dr. Gray. 
    And according to his complaint, the prisoner in this case saw Dr. Gray and other medical personnel on at least 17 different occasions at which time he was given medicine and otherwise treated with back injury, as well as his other ailments. 
    Accordingly, the complaint against the doctor was properly dismissed by the District Court. 
    On the other hand, the question whether Gamble was -- has stated a constitutional claim against the other petitioners, the Director of the Department of Corrections and the warden of the prison, these were not separately evaluated by the Court. 
    And for that reason, the case is remanded for the consideration of these other questions. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun concurred from the judgment of the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
