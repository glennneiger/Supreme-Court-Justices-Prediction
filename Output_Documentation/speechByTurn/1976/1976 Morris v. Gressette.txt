    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    I also have to announce to the Court the decision in the case of Morris against Gressette coming to us from a three-judge District Court in South Carolina. 
    This case presents a rather technical issue under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
    The issue consents a scope of judicial review where the Attorney General failed to interpose under that Act a timely objection to a reapportionment change in the laws of South Carolina. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we agree with the three-judge court that the Act does not contemplate the type of judicial review that was sorted in this case by the appellants. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed. 
    Dissenting opinions have been filed by Mr. Justice Brennan, joined by Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun also has filed a dissenting opinion.
