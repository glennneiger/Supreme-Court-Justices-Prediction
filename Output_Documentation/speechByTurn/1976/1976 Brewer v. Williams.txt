    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by virtue of the grant of a petition for certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    In this case in Iowa trial jury found the respondent, Robert Williams, guilty of the murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
    The judgment of conviction was affirmed in the Iowa Supreme Court by a closely divided vote. 
    In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, a Federal District Court ruled that under the United States Constitution, Williams is entitled to a new trial, and a divided Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed. 
    The question before us is whether the District Court and the Court of Appeals were wrong. 
    The District Court held that Williams, after he had been arraigned and had consulted with two different lawyers, had been deprived of his constitutionally-protected right to the assistance of counsel during the course of a 160-mile automobile trip from Davenport, Iowa to Des Moines, Iowa in a custody of two police officers. 
    The Court further found that Williams had not waived the protection of this constitutional guarantee. Accordingly, the District Court held that incriminating information disclosed by Williams to the police officers during the automobile ride was wrongly admitted in evidence against Williams at his Iowa trial. 
    The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court and affirmed its judgment. 
    And for the reasons set out in some detail, in the written opinion filed today, we also agree and accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Although we do not likely affirm the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in this case, so clear a violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as here occurred, cannot be ignored. 
    The pressures on state executive and judicial officers, charged with the administration of the criminal law, are often great, and especially so, when the crime is murder and the victim, a child. 
    But it is precisely the predictability of these pressures that makes imperative a resolute loyalty to the guarantees that the Constitution extends to us all. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Stevens, who, along with Mr. Justice Brennan, have joined the opinion of the Court, have also each filed concurring opinions.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    In this unusual case today, the Court concedes in its opinion that Mr. Justice Stewart has just summarized that Williams was not threatened or coerced and that he acted voluntarily under his full awareness of his constitutional rights when he guided the police to the place where he had buried the body of the murdered child. 
    In the face of this, the Court now holds that because Williams was prompted by a statement of the detective not interrogation in the traditional sense, but a statement by the detective that pricked his conscience, his disclosure of how and where he buried the body of the child cannot be given to the jury. 
    The effect of this is to fulfill a very grisly prophecy made by Justice Cardozo, approximately 50 years ago that someday, some Court might carry what we call the exclusionary rule to the absurd extent that its operative effect would be to exclude the evidence relating to the body of a murder victim and -- but that would be done because of the means by which it was found. 
    Justice Cardozo then, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of New York, said this. 
    "The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered. 
    A room is searched against the law, and the body of a murdered man is found. 
    And because the privacy of the home has been infringed, the murderer goes free." 
    Now here, as Justice Stewart has indicated, a new trial is to be granted, but the evidence of how the police found the body guided there by Williams, the perpetrator must not be given to the jury. 
    In this holding, the Court regresses in my judgment to playing the grisly game of hide and seek and once more exalting the sporting theory of criminal justice which has been fortunately for the American people experiencing some decline in our jurisprudence. 
    And with Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist, I categorically reject the extraordinary notion that the police in this case were guilty of unconstitutional misconduct, or any conduct whatever that would justify the bizarre result reached by the Court. 
    However, I'd like to focus primarily, since Mr. Justice Stewart has set out the basic facts. 
    I would like to focus on the irrationality of applying the increasingly discredited exclusionary rule to this particular case, this kind of a case. 
    In his opinion -- in his separate opinion in which he concurs in the judgment of the Court and the opinion of the Court, and the exclusion of this evidence of the body, Mr. Justice Powell intimates that he agrees that there is little sense in applying the exclusionary rule where the evidence suppressed is typically reliable and often the most probative information bearing on the guilt or the innocence of the defendant. 
    And since he seems to concede that the evidence in question here is highly reliable and probative, his joining the Court's opinion can be explained as I see it only by an insistence that the question has not been presented in the briefs and arguments submitted to us. 
    It would seem to me, if that were the case, we should set the case for reargument or remand to the Court of Appeals to consider that aspect of the case. 
    The weird result reached by the Court today, and to me there is nothing less than that, recalls Mr. Justice Black's very vigorous dissent in Kaufman against the United States eight years ago. 
    Thereto, a defendant sought release after his conviction had been affirmed on appeal in the state courts. 
    There, as in this case, the defendant's guilt of the criminal act, was crystal clear and was not called into question by the constitutional claims. 
    The Court -- this Court in the Kaufman case eight years ago, granted relief because it thought reliable evidence had been unconstitutionally obtained. 
    Mr. Justice Black's reaction, foreshadowing our long overdue holding of last year, in Stone against Powell, written by Mr. Justice Powell, serves as a fitting conclusion to the views that I have just expressed. 
    And here's what Mr. Justice Black had to say on that day in 1968: “It is seemingly becoming more and more difficult to gain acceptance for the proposition that punishment of the guilty is desirable, other things being equal. 
    One commentator, who attempted in vain to dissuade this Court from today's holding, thought it necessary to point out that there is a strong public interest in convicting the guilty.” 
    Indeed, the day may soon come when the ever cautious law reviewers will actually be forced to offer the timid and uncertain contention, recently suggested satirically that crime may be thought socially undesirable and its control thought to be a valid governmental objective to which the criminal law is rationally related. 
    Continuing Justice Black's dissent, “I cannot agree,” said he to a rule, “however technical it may be that leads to these results. 
    I would not let any criminal conviction become invulnerable to collateral attack where there is left remaining the probability or even the possibility that constitutional commands relating to the integrity of the fact-finding process have been violated. 
    In such situation, society has failed to perform its obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime. 
    But it is quite a different thing, quite a different thing to permit collateral attack on a state court conviction after a trial according to due process when the defendant clearly is, by the proof and by his own admissions, guilty of the crime charged. 
    There may be of course, as the Court of Appeals held in the Thornton case, some special circumstances in which allowance of the Fourth Amendment in a collateral proceeding would be justified in terms of the relevant and applicable constitutional principles. 
    Some of the situations, possibly falling in this category have been enumerated and examined by others, and there are circumstances alleged here that might lead to such a disposition in this case, but the Court does not rest its judgment on this narrow ground. 
    And I therefore, this is Justice Black speaking, “Do not attempt to pass upon it”. 
    I do contend, however, that the court below was correct in refusing to follow the broad rule that this Court is announcing today. 
    In collateral attacks whether by habeas corpus or by Section 2255 proceedings, I would always require that the convicted defendant raise some kind of constitutional claim that cast a shadow of doubt on his guilt. 
    This defendant here is permitted to attack his conviction collaterally, although he conceded at the trial and does not now deny that he had robbed the bank and that -- and although the evidence makes absolutely clear that he knew what he was doing at the time. 
    Thus, his guilt being certain, surely, he does not have a constitutional right to get a new trial. 
    Therefore, Justice Black concluded, “I cannot possibly agree with the Court.” 
    Here, in the case we've decided today, Williams, in legal effect admitted the commission of this murder by his plea in the Iowa state courts of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    The jury in the state court rejected that claim and found him guilty. 
    As of course he was and no member of the Court on either -- of either view questions that fact today. 
    But because the detective in the course of the drive from Davenport to Des Moines made a statement which pricked his conscience, the evidence as to how the child's body was found must be forever concealed from any jury that may hear this case in the future if indeed the State elects to proceed. 
    It is often been said the law goes by trial and error and perhaps that's the way it must be. 
    But in the view of four us, today's case is one of those errors. 
    Appellee by the close vote of trial before us saw that only one converse is needed to bring the rationality into this area of the law.
