    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The first of this involves three life insurance companies under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The Federal Income Tax burden on life insurance companies is considerably lower than that imposed on other insurance companies. 
    A question in these cases is whether the taxpayers, three insurance companies, that write both life and non-life insurance qualify for this preferential treatment. 
    For a reason set forth in their opinion filed today with the clerk, we agree with the taxpayers that they do qualify. 
    The judgments in 75-1221 and 75-1285, the cases hereon on certiorari to the Court of Claims are affirmed. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 75-1260 is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.
