    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The respondent in this case the Housing Corporation decides to build in the Village of Arlington Heights, Illinois a townhouse complex for low-and moderate-income tenants. 
    The Village and suburb of Chicago is own only for single family homes. 
    Its population is predominantly white. 
    The respondent negotiated a purchase agreement covering a 15-acre site upon which it proposed to construct the project. 
    But the Village authorities after public hearings refused to rezone the property from single family to multi-family classification. 
    The respondent joins our individuals instituted this suit in an Illinois District Court. 
    They alleged that their refusal to rezone was racially discriminatory, violating the Fourteenth Amendment and federal Fair Housing Act. 
    At the following trial, the District Court had a judgment for the Village but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 
    Looking solely to the ultimate effect, the Circuit Court viewed the denial to rezone as discriminatory. 
    In Washington against Davis decided last time, we held that official action is not invalid solely because it results in a racially disproportionate effect. 
    We held that proof of a discriminatory intent is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    In this case, the District Court found that the refusal to rezone was based on legitimate land use considerations and was not racially motivated. 
    The Court of Appeals agreed with this finding, but nevertheless held that the effect of the refusal was determinative as this is not in a Court with our decision in Washington against Davis, we reserved the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    We remand the case for consideration of the fair housing claim, a claim not resolved by the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall joined by Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in thought and dissenting in thought. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
