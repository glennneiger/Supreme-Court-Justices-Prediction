    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Hankerson case is here from the state courts in North Carolina. 
    It also relates to Mullaney against Wilbur. 
    The North Carolina court held that that decision was not retroactive and did not apply to cases that had been decided or -- or held that it -- it was not retroactive and did not apply to cases that have been decided prior to our decision in that case. 
    We reversed in our view under our prior cases even if retroactivity, Mullaney against Wilbur, is indeed retroactive. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun while joining the opinions of the Court has filed a concurring opinion, the Chief Justice has joined him. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Powell have each filed opinions concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration and decision of the case.
