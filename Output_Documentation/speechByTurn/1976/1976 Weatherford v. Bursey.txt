    Justice Byron R. White 
    Weatherford against Bursey is the other case that I have. 
    It comes here from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    It involves the question of whether the constitutional rights of -- of the defendant, Bursey in a state criminal jury trial were violated by the post arrest but pretrial activities of an undercover agent of the State -- of a state investigative agency. 
    The undercover agent testified at the trial. 
    The state courts upheld the conviction and Bursey was -- served his -- served his sentence. 
    He then began this -- he then began a 1983 action in the Federal District Court. 
    The Federal District Court held against him in all respects but the Court of Appeals held that the undercover agent's activities had invaded Bursey's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel. 
    Disagreeing with the Court of Appeals, we reversed and our reasons are given in an opinion on file with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Mr. Justice Brennan.
