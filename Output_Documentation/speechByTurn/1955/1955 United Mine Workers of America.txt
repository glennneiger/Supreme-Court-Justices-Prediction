    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Harris, you may proceed.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="3.614" stopTime="643.189">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    In order to get the full force in effect of the Arkansas decision, it seems to me if we should consider for a few moments the National Labor Relation Act and how it has been construed by the federal courts. 
    That Act regardless of how men may differ as to its economic philosophy was unquestionly -- unquestionably a long considered bit of legislation. 
    To my mind it is precision legislation. 
    It seems to me that Congress knew exactly what they wanted to do and carefully proceeded to do it or to try to do it and its important to note that the Congress at no place put in a requirement that a union must comply or file the documents specified in 9 (f), (g) and (h) in order to have the right of representation. 
    There is as I see it no legal compulsion on a labor union to file those documents. 
    They had an option. 
    It seems to me that the draftsman on the part of the Senate, the sponsor on the part of the Senate who had mathematics for recreation followed the example of some of the great mathematicians. 
    When you have a great deal of trouble proving something approaching it from one direction start over again and approach it from the opposite direction. 
    And the Labor Management Relations Act is not a law drawn on compulsions, it did make it unlawful from the failure to file. 
    It didn't deprive him of any right of representation. 
    Instead of making it compulsory the statute is framed on an inducement basis. 
    A man isn't compelled to file a non-communist affidavit, a labor union is not compelled to file its financial reports. 
    The perversions in the law are that if he does not, if they are not filed no investigation will be made by the Board and they will not process a complaint made by a union that didn't file those papers. 
    No forfeiture of any basic protected right under the Act. 
    It's merely a denial of processes. 
    The -- you might call it as some of the cases have done a series of benefits and determents. 
    But it seems to me that the men framing it avoided constitutional questions by treating everybody alike. 
    Anybody that wants to come in and get the benefit of the processes of the Board can get him by filing those papers. 
    If he doesn't file the papers, if the union doesn't file them there's no penalty, there's no fine, there is forfeiture in the Act. 
    The -- as a matter of fact the way the Act is worded, you can look at it from the opposite direction that 9 (f), (g) and (h) are limitations on the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. 
    They set up this machinery, the Congress sets it up and says you can do certain things but here are two things that you can't do under certain circumstances. 
    So when Congress fail to take make certification a condition precedent, I say that that was not accidental. 
    I think every phrase in that law requires careful study. 
    Now what Louisiana did, it comes along by this opinion, this ad hoc decision and adds a requirement to the right of representation which the federal law does not impose. 
    Louisiana says since you cannot be certified, you cannot exercise your right protected by 13 of the Act to strike. 
    Since you can't be certified and I am not recognized you can't compel anything. 
    Now if they can come along and add by judicial decision a requirement of certification prior to representation, then the Supreme Court of Louisiana has amended the act of Congress in a basic point, on a basic theme and we see that under the decisions of this Court, the Garner case and the Weber case, said, we have a clearcut declaration of federal policy. 
    The Federal Government has declared certain things to be an unfair labor practice. 
    If it's an unfair labor practice a state cannot either by decision or by statute invade upon the province outlined and delineated by Congress for this great administrative board. 
    To us it seems as if Congress having entered the field and having said we proscribe certain types of strikes that as indicated in a paragraph in the Garner case and referred to again in the Weber case that Congress having entered this field and having proscribed certain types of strikes would seem to imply that other kinds of strikes are permitted. 
    Well now if we are going to have a complicated mechanism of solving the infinite number of problems that will arise in American Labor Relations, a machinery carefully set up by the Congress and then one state can come in and say we will put a requirement of certification in and another state would come in and say as they did down there, peaceful picketing. 
    No matter what kind of picketing it was peaceful picketing for the purpose of getting recognition from the employer is unlawful. 
    Well if it's protected by the Federal Act it's protected against state intrusion. 
    The -- the question of peaceful picketing, the cases of Hanker and Gazzam, those cases were not as I read cases involving a right protected by the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    The -- they discussed picketing and differentiated picketing from being the exact equivalent of free speech. 
    But if the picketing is in a perfectly peaceful manner and if its for a lawful object then it is protected by the Labor Management Relations Act and being protected the state can't prohibit it. 
    As they argue in the -- this Court asked the Solicitor General to file a brief and it does matter according to the opinion of the Solicitor General as written in their brief of whether or not they had certification if they are exercising a protected right, if it's into the field which has been preempted by Congress, then they say that even picketing by a minority would be protected. 
    In answer to your question Mr. Justice Burton about the majority, there was never in a question of fact on whether or not the union had a majority. 
    They -- they didn't refuse to deal with him because they had no majority. 
    They weren't even willing to find out if they had a majority.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="643.189" stopTime="660.791">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Well, the point that I had in mind particularly here is a suit being brought in Louisiana. 
    Now, if one of the allegations is that there is picketing where there was only a minority, that seemed to be a matter that would be within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, therefore the Louisiana case would be out.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="660.791" stopTime="660.922">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    That's right.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="660.922" stopTime="667.561">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Now -- and you're arguing that even though they had a majority it's also within the National Labor Relation Board and they're out again.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="667.561" stopTime="668.413">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    That's right.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="668.413" stopTime="676.951">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    But I would think they'd clearly be out in the first instance where they are picketing for a -- for a minority because that's squarely comes under the National Labor Relations Board, doesn't it?
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="676.951" stopTime="691.664">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    That would be bringing employer coercion on the -- through a labor union to influence these other employees to join the union.And that would be covered and they charge in paragraph 10.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="691.664" stopTime="693.345">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    That's what I am referring to.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="693.345" stopTime="761.039">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    They charge what amounts to an unfair labor practice and Mr. McCain in framing his defenses from the very beginning, the first thing he did in his exception ratione materiae -- ratione materiae was to say that this was covered, his exceptions to the jurisdiction, it was an exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    Then when he came to his return to the rule in his answer he added the additional averment that it was not only in the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act but he also added to the averment that it was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And so far as we've been able to find, no case has presented this question as clearly and succinctly as the facts of this case presented to this Court today.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="761.039" stopTime="766.434">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Does the National Labor Relations Board have some jurisdiction here?

    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    In -- in this case?
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="767.557" stopTime="768.900">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Yes.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="768.900" stopTime="801.781">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    Why, the National Labor Relations Board would have jurisdiction if they file, either party for instance the District 50 couldn't file a petition with him. 
    But the employer if he were in any doubt could file a petition and go before the National Labor Relations Board. 
    Further, we are in compliance with 9 (f), (g) and (h) or not, if we are guilty of an unfair labor practice.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="801.781" stopTime="803.815">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    You may assert that before the labor board.
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="803.815" stopTime="806.946">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    Yes, sir. 
    And not only they may assert it.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="806.946" stopTime="815.993">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Is it your position that they must assert it under Weber and Garner? 
    What's asserted for the Labor Board under Weber and Garner?
speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="815.993" stopTime="891.915">
    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    Yes. 
    I think it is, Your Honor. 
    They can't -- they can't get -- a state court is not the proper court to try questions of unfair labor practice. 
    This complicated mechanism with a general counsel responsible for filing the complaints with the Board separated from the trial examiners, with the Board made more judicial body, that is a complete system for the solution of labor problems by men who are presumably expert and they certainly have jurisdiction and if -- whether a union is in compliance or not they can order them to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and if they don't they can go before the court under the procedures prescribed by the Act. 
    So we see that Louisiana has trespassed upon the law, it's added an amendment to an act of Congress and it has deprived the Labor Board of jurisdiction and so far as the record showed they never made any effort to see the Labor Board about anything.

    There isn't any question of an appropriate unit in this case.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    From what's in my mind and it used to be in the Wagner Act that the appropriate unit would be designated by the Board. 
    Now, that's been changed as I understand it in the National -- in the Taft-Hartley amendments?

    Mr. Crampton Harris 
    No. 
    There's never been any question but what these men would organize in an appropriate unit. 
    It's never raised in the lower court. 
    It's never raised by the Supreme Court of Louisiana and the evidence in the case shows that these were plant employees and if they were not -- none of the men who signed the cards were clerical or other employees. 
    There were a 174 and at the trail 179 of the 225 plant employees. 
    We have no question of an appropriate unit.

    It has been suggested by my colleague Mr. Cowherd that it -- we made a contract with an employee and we were outside the appropriate unit our contract would not be a bar or a protection to it.

   Argument of John L. Pitts
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1032.119" stopTime="1034.880">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Pitts.
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1034.880" stopTime="1199.816">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    If the Court please. 
    I am going to have to be more specific in the discussion of the sections of the Labor Relations or the Labor Management Relations Act and Mr. Harris. 
    The union in this case is District 50 of the United Mine Workers. 
    This is a union which has deliberately and as a matter of policy refused to comply with Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h) of the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    It was not admittedly inadvertently or temporarily out of compliance. 
    That is a studied union policy in this case. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, that's the gravamen of this case in the light of the interpretation of the effective -- the action of this union under the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    Now, here is what happened. 
    A representative of the union called upon the employer and says we want representation. 
    We want to be recognized. 
    The Company was familiar with the fact that this District 50 was a non-complying union that it had failed to comply with the sections of the Act which require the execution of the non-communist oath and the filing of the financial data giving the disclosure to the proper authorities of the -- disclose your financial information dues and things of that type to union members. 
    Now, the employer in this case stated that the Board does not recognize you and for that reason we will not deal with you and we will not bargain with you. 
    Now, the employer here feels that if it had agreed to bargain and deal with this union it would have given up certain substantial rights which it has under the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    In the first place, if this were a complying union that had made that demand the employer could have said, "Well now we do not accept your protestation of majority status. 
    You see that you represent a majority but we wish to have a board supervised secret election." 
    As one of things that was kept -- would have been taken away from us if we had volunteer to recognize this union. 
    Now, if Your Honor's please --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1199.816" stopTime="1203.789">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why do say that would be taken away from you?
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1203.789" stopTime="1257.434">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    If Your Honor please, the Board itself has held that it will not entertain a petition for an election even as to the employer. 
    Now, it's obvious that the union could not go before the Board because it has not complied and that all the Board processes were denied to this union, and the Board is likewise held that we could not go with the Board under those circumstances and petition for an election. 
    And the reasoning is this, if the Board found that the union did have a majority, the union on under such circumstances would be indirectly getting the benefit of the processes of the Board. 
    Now I have cited the several cases which the Board quotes that in the brief and that was one of the material things it was commented upon by the Louisiana Supreme Court.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1257.434" stopTime="1261.844">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What -- what section? 
    Is that a section of the Act? 
    What was that?
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1261.844" stopTime="1267.187">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    Your Honor, that's not a -- that's not a Section of the Act, that's a judicial interpretation --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1267.187" stopTime="1267.700">
    Unknown Speaker 
    How -- how do you --

    -- by the Board.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1268.084" stopTime="1279.433">
    Unknown Speaker 
    How do you -- do you object to the representative of the Board saying that (Inaudible) they have -- don't they have to go to the Board then?
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1279.433" stopTime="1298.935">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    No, sir. 
    We could not go to the Board. 
    That is one of the -- one of the things we have been denied under the Act. 
    Now, that seems clear. 
    Now, the obvious answer to that is that the brief filed by the Board in this case did not even intimate it. 
    We could have gone to the Board and obtained an election and of course the Board has so held.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1298.935" stopTime="1304.450">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, did the Board base that upon a specific Section of the Labor Relations Act or what?
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1304.450" stopTime="1419.456">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    No. 
    It just -- it based it under Section -- on Sections 9 (g) and (h), (f), (g), and (h) which denied the services of the Board and the processes of the Board to any non-complying union. 
    And they say even if the employer is the one who asks for the election, we won't call it an election because if we finally decide that the union wins, we are indirectly defeating the purpose of the Act in giving the result of the election. 
    And -- and they say further that if they should find, if they should hold an election and find that the union was successful and had a majority, they couldn't certify them because that is denied under the Act. 
    So that's one of the first things, there are several other disadvantages that we have given up on. 
    I'm seeing at the outset the reasons why we object dealing with a non-complying union. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, that's the -- that's the flat proposition that we have before this Court, whether we have to deal with -- and bargain with this non-complying union. 
    Now I say this, if -- if we refuse to bargain with this union and Your Honors overrule the state court decision and let them put a picket line back, we still do not legally have to bargain with them because they can't go out before the Board and compel us to bargain with them. 
    That's obviously an unfair labor practice to refuse them -- to refuse to bargain. 
    So that the Board was -- is the only agency that have a right to hear that question. 
    But they have -- whoever shut them off, seals off, from any possible Board relief by refusing to comply with this Act. 
    Incidentally --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1419.456" stopTime="1442.239">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What -- what about 9 (c) -- 9 (c) of the Act? 
    Whenever a petition shall have been filed, according to such regulation it'd be described by the Board by an employer alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations had presented to him a claim to be recognized, the Board shall investigate and so forth.
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1442.239" stopTime="1482.418">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    Well, Your Honor under that Section, the Board had repeatedly held that it will not entertain an election on the -- at the request of the employer. 
    It's obviously to inflict -- that the union under such circumstances did not go before the Board because they can't go before the Board under any circumstance. 
    But the Board has held and construe in that Section that it does not have to -- it will not call an election even at the behest of the employer. 
    Now, the question --

    But 9 (c) (1) (B) reads by an employer, alleging that one or more individuals can present to him a claim to be recognized as a representative. 
    (Inaudible) Section 9 (a), the Board shall investigate certain petitions.
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="1655.449" stopTime="1872.420">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    If Your Honor please, here is the case which I have in mind is Herman Loewenstein, Incorporated reported in 75 N. L. R. B. 
    That's on the appendix, page 27 of the respondent's brief. 
    Now, they have gone in that case, they say this, although it is the employer's petition in a Circuit case, and so on the next page 28, it sets the Board's machinery in motion. 
    It is an individuals or a labor organization's initial claim for recognition that makes it possible for the employer to invoke that machine. 
    And it goes on to say that under the circumstances they will refuse even the employer any relief under the Act. 
    Now, so if the Court please, it seems to me that the question before the Court here is whether primary picketing by a non-complying union is either prohibited by the management Labor Relations Act or whether it is as an unfair labor practice or whether it is a fully protected right under the Act. 
    Now certain practices are enumerated in the Act as unfair labor practices. 
    These are coercion of employees, coercion of an employer in selecting his negotiator, a union refusal to bargain, a secondary board cut and things of that type, finally they wind up with (Inaudible). 
    It is obviously not any one of these things. 
    It is not an unfair labor practice. 
    Now, if this were an unfair labor practice under the Act, we could go before the Board. 
    But it clearly is not and I think the strongest proof or intimation that it is not an unfair labor practice is there is no intimation whatever in the Board's brief that it is an unfair labor practice. 
    And the Board has held on a number of occasions that primary picketing for recognition by such a union is not an unfair labor practice and so the Board would not act on that ground. 
    Now, of course as this Court has said if it weren't an unfair labor practice, you would have a direct conflict between the Board and the state courts. 
    And in that case we would have an easy decision to the effect that the state courts had no jurisdiction. 
    So to pass from the unfair labor practice or easy phase of the case, we come to the cloudy or penumbral area as it had been referred to by this Court. 
    And parenthetically when I was attempting to reconcile the various state board, labor board and Federal Court of Appeal decisions, why, I could progressively appreciate the meaning of that word, penumbra, and I always had to come back to what I consider as a -- the (Inaudible) landmark cases regulating labor relations by this Court.

    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    -- in a latest expression of the Board, the Sunset Lumber Products case, the Board -- that was decided last year in the year 1955, the Board held that when an employer is faced with the demand for recognition by labor organization, at page 31 in my brief, which claimed to represent a majority of his employees, he may refuse to rely upon evidence of the union's representation and insist upon the union establishing its majority in a board election. 
    Now it's true that the employer must act in good faith under those circumstances. 
    The -- the Board has held that if that is merely a subterfuge and if the employer is not bonafide in asserting it decided to deal with a recognized and certified union and that's an effort though such as in the Pecheur Lozenge which has been cited in the Joy Silk Mills case. 
    They say that if the employer is in good faith and he starts of by saying he wants to deal only with a recognized union, he is entitled to the election. 
    Now to get back to Your Honor's question about what the other advantages are for us to deal with a complying union or a certified union rather than a non-complying union such as this, apart from the question of -- the advantage of being able to get a board election, we would be free from labor disturbances because if we contracted with this non-complying union, any other union could come in and fix and we'd have no Board relief. 
    And yet if this was a certified union that would be an unfair labor practice where this other union had come in and picket us while we have a contract with a certified union. 
    Now that's an advantage to the employer, a very definite advantage which we say we're entitled to under the Act. 
    In other words the status of the permits of a recognized certified union. 
    Now --

    Well, the reason that it was the policy of the Board is not to afford any -- any protection or services to a non-complying union and that if the -- even if the employer were the one that invoked the processes of the Board to have the election if it turned out that the labor union won the election, then in such case the Board would be depleting the purposes of the Act by permitting the union to get the indirect benefit which the Act did not intend it to have.

    Well, -- well, evidently I haven't looked at the Government's brief (Inaudible) 
    Evidently the Board's stand under that, on page 11, Footnote 4, the employer -- a union may not have to redress for the Board, normally it has some stages of exclusive representative verified by a Board certificate. 
    The footnote says, this is so irrespective of whether the non-complying union is dealt by the representation petition, it is filed by the employer or the petition has been filed by a complying union and the non-complying union thereafter enter the -- in the proceeding. 
    And if fact, the Lowenstein case, (Inaudible) at first the District Court, three-judge court, and determined by the Second -- by the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="2973.822" stopTime="3269.349">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    If Your Honors please, I -- I believe that under these leading cases when this Court, Anheuser-Busch case and several cases recently discussed and acted upon by this Court that there is no absolute protection to an non-complying union to picket for recognition. 
    Now in the Anheuser-Busch case Your Honors stated that the federal Act has not absorbed all state action and it pointed out in the Allen Bradley, that in the Allen Bradley case, Allen Bradley Local against Wisconsin Board the states were permitted to enjoin mass picketing and blocking of plant entrances and picketing at homes and that type. 
    And in the International case of International Union against Wisconsin Board, the Court allowed a state injunction against the current wage stoppages, the current owner now for wage stoppages that had a tendency to upset the employer's manufacturing operations. 
    And the Court stated that if the particular practice is neither prohibited nor sanctioned by the federal Act then it is left to the regulations of the states. 
    Now, we say that there is no definite sanction or prohibition against primary picketing by a non-complying union in this Act. 
    Now as -- I do not believe that Section 7 and 13 of the Act, in the light of the history of these sections was intended to grant protection in a case of this type where the union has not complied with the direct mandate of Congress. 
    In the case of International Union against Wisconsin Board, this Court stated that right granted in Section 7 contemplates a lawful strike and does not legalize any and every type of concerted activity. 
    Now I say that under the rulings of these cases and a further statement of the Court at Section 7 (c) and 13 do not give any special dispensation to the right to strike. 
    But outlaw strikes to enforce labor practice to enforce unfair labor practices that this Court could well hold that a strike under these circumstances which denies us the rights which we say we have under the Act is neither prohibited nor protected. 
    Under the -- I believe it to broad purposes of the Wagner and the Taft Acts were to eliminate the economic loss it tendered upon strikes in every case where it was possible. 
    Now, you take this particular case right here. 
    If this were a complying union and made a demand for recognition, they would not have to strike to get it, they could go before the Board. 
    Now if that had been true and we had refused and they had gone before the Board, why, the employees would have been still earning wages and the company would have been in production, you've had no interruption. 
    I think if that is a type of thing its intended to be brought about by the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    There's no material change in either of these sections in the -- from the Wagner Act to Taft-Hartley Act in the Act, in the later Act in 1947 Amendment, the conspiracy weapon was taken away from the employers. 
    In other words, any union action, it was otherwise lawful was not made unlawful simply because it was undertaken by several persons in concert. 
    And I believe it those were the principle changes that were made in Section 713 in the Act. 
    And this Court in the Laburnum case stated that in the Garner case the very care which the Court took to point out that if a -- that if a conflict existed the state court must yield, was in itself on assertion that if there was no conflict then a state action would survive. 
    I say that in this case there cannot possibly be any conflict between the state court and the National Labor Relations Board for the simple reason that this Board has forever shut itself off from any possible remedy. 
    This union has shut itself off from any many possible remedy with the National Labor Relations Board. 
    It can't go before it under any circumstances.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3269.349" stopTime="3278.607">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And if that was the purpose of Congress, why didn't they say that under no circumstances that they come before the Board?
speaker="john_l_pitts" startTime="3278.607" stopTime="3364.536">
    Mr. John L. Pitts 
    Your Honor please that's a good question and I wonder that myself. 
    It -- they do not see that and yet they deny them the processes of the Board and the only answer that I can make to it is that Congress thought that that would be sanctions enough without fining them a $100 or six months in jail or something of that type, if they denied them the processes of the Board, they felt that was the strongest sanctions they could have put on. 
    There's no condition attached to these qualifications. 
    It says that the union shall do so and so. 
    And I believe that Congress undoubtedly intended that they be complied with or they -- that they have no standing. 
    Now in this -- in one case decided by this Court on another point, it involved the time of filing a charge in the time of issuance of the compliant. 
    That is the (Inaudible) Russell case which I -- decided by this Court and referred to by me on page 40 of my brief. 
    The Court said in that case phrased differently. 
    The argument is that the benefits of the Act may not flow to a labor organization unless the non-communist affidavits were on file. 
    We agree with the argument and believe it is in accord with our interpretation of Section 9 (a). 
    That's what the Court -- this Court said in the (Inaudible) Russell case.

    And if it comes down to a question of the balancing of conveniences as to the hardships that would work on us to deal with a non-complying union and a hardship that will work on the union -- by complying with the Act which I see are none, then I see that the scales of balance in favor of the employer because we engage in commerce, we come under the Act regardless and we believe that we are entitled to the -- any advantages there that might possibly approve to us if we comply with our part of it and we say the union must do likewise.

    Well, but you can't eat your pie and keep it. 
    You can't -- you can't say that you offered no proof in response to these pleadings and then at the same time say to this Court that you doubt very seriously whether they had that majority, can you?

    If Your Honor -- if Your Honor please, it goes deeper than that, we contend that we are not obligated to deal with the non-complying union.

    Yes.

    Well, isn't that the way that whole allegation -- your paragraph 10 comes in and says that they were picketing without having selected a representative.

    We made that allegations Your Honor and to tell you frankly we didn't know what the actual facts were at that time because we had not -- we had never seen these cards. 
    You know, the picket line was set up and in the practice of law when you have to go in and draw in a petition for an injunction on the basis of what information you have, why, your allegations might not exactly conform with the proof that you met with when you try the injunction. 
    Now, on a trial it was shown that they had a 174 cards signed up. 
    We don't deny that and we couldn't reverse it.

    225, they had a 174 cards out of 225. 
    I -- I just want to discuss a case that I started to mention a moment ago. 
    In one case, a union was recognized. 
    It was not certified. 
    The employer voluntarily recognized the union, and the union went before the Board and asked for a certification. 
    And employers says that there's no need for a certification, an election because I have already recognized. 
    And yet in that case the Board says that there are certain advantages attached to the status of a certified union and even though the employer has recognized the union you are entitled to go ahead and have the election and be certified. 
    Now that's -- that is a stamp of -- puts a stamp of approval on a -- the Board of the advantage of dealing with a certified union. 
    Now, that's one of the things that we think that they'd do under the broad purposes of the Act.
