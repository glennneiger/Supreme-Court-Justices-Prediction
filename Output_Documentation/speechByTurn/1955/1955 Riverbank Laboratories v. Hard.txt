    Mr. David A. Fox 
    Directly prior to the recess, Your Honor had a question which I had -- had neglected to answer. 
    We believe you had asked what authority I had in my assertion that Congress had utilized this term in a technical sense.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="19.991" stopTime="36.006">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I thought you had said that through a reason was the answer and that's all -- all that you had, but then I ask you, well if -- if Congress do it and you said Congress could very easily have said that it wanted that way. 
    How would you set it if -- if you are going to say it other than Congress did?
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="36.006" stopTime="46.098">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    Perhaps, I would have had reverted to the language of enactment that existed before 1948, where the word "found" was --

    (Voice Overlap)
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="47.152" stopTime="53.102">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    The word found was utilized. 
    There was an ambiguity --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="53.102" stopTime="55.389">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may found that they were doing business.
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="55.389" stopTime="94.324">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    Yes, whether -- whether a party maybe found, originally, the enactment had referred to the residents of the plaintiff, I believe, and the place where the defendant was found and there had been difficulty in trying to reconcile those two different terms used apparently for the same purpose. 
    And if they had intended that it'd be a mere matter of the place where found, then it would have abolished the word residents entirely and to put the defendants entirely on the word found. 
    That's --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="94.324" stopTime="110.768">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Maybe they didn't want to do that, maybe they want to do exactly what they said and -- and confine it to those who were authorized the registry to do business for those who were actually doing business in the State. 
    Maybe they didn't want to go as far as to say for who was found in that jurisdiction.
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="110.768" stopTime="150.263">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    That I believe is the logical conclusion and I believe that although this case presents a narrower point and this is involved in a diversity situation in the Erie doctrine is present that that when a question does arise, it may have to be considered as even in the federal case as long as Section 1391 (c) remains in its present form. 
    That question may have to be decided as well is whether the state rule, the technical meaning of doing business is using that language will be applicable in a federal question case.Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="150.263" stopTime="167.454">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the thing that I can't quite understand is -- is what leads you to say that Congress must have meant doing business according to the understanding of state law?
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="167.454" stopTime="197.796">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    I'd say that on this ground, Your Honor, that the basis of a doctrine of Erie versus Tompkins is that there is not and that doctrine renounces the existence of some kind of a super distilled over dominating law where the question is one, which is ordinarily decided by the States.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="197.796" stopTime="203.811">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, its venue a question of a substantive law or a question of procedure?
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="203.811" stopTime="215.808">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    I would say that it could be treated as procedural. 
    I -- I would think that would be the natural category using that term in its technical meaning. 
    But under --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="215.808" stopTime="224.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, if it's procedural which procedure should apply in the federal case, federal or state?
speaker="david_a_fox" startTime="224.572" stopTime="341.665">
    Mr. David A. Fox 
    The state rule as it effects this procedural question should apply. 
    Now, it is not procedural in the sense of the manner in which the Court has conducted. 
    It is a right, which is -- has its outcome determinative effect and the doctrine of Erie versus Tompkins has its vitality because of the versatility that it has. 
    And that drives out versatility, I believe, from the decisions of this Court and this Court has not have difficulty over this simple distinction between substantive and procedural. 
    It went to the fact of what would happen and whether or not the case would have preceded in the state court or whether it would not have proceeded in the state court. 
    And the decisions have made it plain that it is -- that is the result of this to be the criterion and not any narrow question of technical meaning. 
    The -- the importance here in this case of not adopting an exception to the Erie rule has very plainly brought out by the fact that you can treat this thing if you want under a technical term of procedure but the result would be diametrically opposite. 
    The case would proceed in the federal court while they block down the street and the state court case would be dismissed. 
    And that is a sort of thing Erie doctrine is applicable to. 
    And as I say, the vitality of a doctrine has always depended upon the versatility that this Court has been able to give to it and I don't think it would be any difficulty at all in applying the general principle of the doctrine in this case.

    Mr. David A. Fox 
    If I understand the new enactment that has come into effect in Illinois now as of the first of the year in which Mr. Rosenfield has made reference, that a nonresident can be sued under the -- so, in fact, is called in the State of Illinois now only if four categories of matters are involved. 
    First, if there is a transaction out of which the cause of action arose which occurred in Illinois. 
    Second, if there is property located in Illinois which is involved. 
    Third, is whether there is a tort committed in Illinois and fourth, whether there is a contract of insurance insuring a risk in Illinois.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="412.278" stopTime="416.210">

    Mr. David A. Fox 
    And it provides interestingly enough that whether the party is a resident of Illinois or not can be sued in those four categories. 
    But if the defendant is a nonresident and the action doesn't fall in the four categories, the State of Illinois, in order to avoid the crowding of its courts, does not want to have to entertain those suits.

    That is -- that is certainly true, Your Honor. 
    The -- the question that I was answering was when -- in a case of a complaint, how did he function. 
    And this is not in the question of a complaint, but in a question of selecting the doors in the first instance that he was advised -- advising architects. 
    There is one instance in the record that is typical here where the -- the navy had -- some of these doors and they were having difficulty with sound passing through and he called upon the facilities of the plaintiff here to furnish the expert to go and actually analyze what was wrong.

    “Any adjustment of any complaint that you have the authority to replace the merchandise with a new door? 
    Answer “Not unless it was part of, not unless it was approved by the main office.”

    Mr. David A. Fox 
    The -- the mere circumstances of -- of his activity, he was a salesman, he was to obtain the taking of these orders and sending them all to Neenah. 
    When a complaint came from a customer that -- that a door that he -- that had been furnished didn't come up to expectations, as the court below seemed to indicate that that was ancillary to salesmanship of a poorly satisfied customer, one who would ignore and not respond to would be the worst kind of sales tactics.

    This is a case that comes under Section 1391 (c) of the statute. 
    It involves venue. 
    The federal jurisdictional power is not challenged. 
    It exists. 
    The mere fact that it exists does not mean that it has to be exercised. 
    The first reason that the term doing business is to be interpreted as we suggest is that the enactment itself and circumstances surrounding it indicate that Congress intended that the technical meaning that had been attributed to the term should apply. 
    Second, the decisions which I have not mentioned but which are mentioned in the brief in the lower courts uniformly wherever they have actually considered the question have come to the conclusion of the principle of Erie versus Tompkins applies. 
    And third, it's important not to introduce a major exception to the doctrine of Erie versus Tompkins. 
    And this case can easily be comprehended within that doctrine because of the versatility of the doctrine.
