    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    May it please the Court. 
    This appeal is for an order of the three-judge District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, dismissing for one of federal jurisdiction, a suit to enjoin the enforcement of the Illinois Community Currency Exchanges Act on the ground that it is repugnant to the equal rights such Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The material allegations of the amended complaint, which were supported by findings of fact of the District Court or – or admitted in the answer to include to following. 
    That the action of course arises under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, that the amount in controversy, which this Court said in the Gibbs case in 307 U.S. which is cited in the appellant's brief, is the value of the right to conduct the business prohibited by the challenged statute, exceed the sum of $3000 exclusive of interest and cost. 
    And the plaintiffs, Doud, McDonald and Carlson, constitute a partnership doing business under the foreign name of Bondified Systems, that the defendant -- that they're all citizens of Illinois, that the defendant Hodge is a duly qualified and acting Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Illinois. 
    The defendant, Latham Castle is a duly qualified and acting Attorney General of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, Gutknecht as a duly qualified an acting State's Attorney of Cook County, resided in that County in the Northern District. 
    That's submitted on the action. 
    That the partnership is organized for the purpose of, intends to engage and has been engaged not in the ordinary business of a currency exchange, but exclusively in the business of selling and issuing money orders under the firm name, “Bondified Systems” in Cook and other counties in the State of Illinois. 
    That is supported by finding three, page 509 of the record. 
    Then, follows a great deal detail as to how the plaintiffs came to get a license to sell this -- this particular kind of money orders and how they happen to operate as a partnership and not as a corporation. 
    And then, at page 13 of the record is the allegation as to the provisions of the statute involved, which the statute of course is submitted in the answer, page 27 of the record. 
    The Act is an act in relation to the definition, the regulation and licensing of community currency exchanges. 
    It's also ambulatory, so-called ambulatory currency exchanges which are not here involved. 
    The statute purports to regulate the business -- I'm reading from the amended complaint, purports to regulate the business of a community currency exchange which is defined to be, one, a person, firm or a corporation engaged in the business of providing facilities or cashing checks, drafts and money orders for a fee or service charge or other consideration or, two, engaged in the business of selling or issuing money orders in his, there or its name or any other money orders or, the third classification, engaged in both such businesses subject to certain exceptions. 
    At page 14 of the record, the complaint -- the amended complaint further alleges, “The statute likewise specifically exempts from a definition” -- I should say at first it exempts state and national banks. 
    The statute likewise specifically exempt from the definition of a community currency exchanged, all persons, firms and corporations engaged in the business of selling or issuing United States Post Office money orders, American Express Company money orders, Postal Telegraph Company money orders, understand those two are now merged or Western Union Telegraph Company money orders. 
    In other words, the exemption is not only the Post Office, United States Post Office which is, of course, a federal instrumentality, the Western Union Telegraph Company which is regulated by federal law, and also the American Express Company money orders, which is not subject to any regulations whatsoever. 
    The said statute contains the following provisions, regulating the business of the community currency exchange, no person, firm or corporation which is not exempted from the definition of a community currency exchange shall engage in the business of selling or issuing money orders without first securing a license to do so from the Auditor Public Accounts of the State of Illinois. 
    The said statute further provides that a community currency exchange shall not be conducted as a department of another business that it must be an entity, financed, and conducted as a separate business unit. 
    It is then alleged that this classification is unconstitutionally broad in that, one, the American Express Company operates its money order business in substantially the same manner in which said plaintiffs operate. 
    That is supported by the Court's finding of fact. 
    Two, there's a conclusion that the exemption of the American Express money orders is unwanted, not germane to the purpose of the statute and highly discriminatory. 
    Then the allegation that the American Express Company is an aggregation of individuals operating under a joint stock company plan. 
    It is not a corporation but an association of individuals. 
    That's submitted in the action. 
    The answer also admits that the American Express Company sells and issues money orders in the City of Chicago, Illinois through operators of drug and grocery stores, such operators retaining a portion of a fee fixed by the American Express Company for the issuance of its money orders. 
    That is submitted in the answer. 
    The answer also, admits that no statutes in the State of Illinois provide for any regulation by any law, a Board Commission or a regulatory body of the operations of the American Express Company in Illinois. 
    It's also admitted in the answer, the American Express Company does not operate under any franchise, granted to the State of Illinois and said, "American Express Company is not subject to regulation by any regulatory body from the State of Illinois, and the American Express Company agencies in issuing money orders are in direct competition where the operations by the said plaintiffs.” 
    That's supported by the Court's finding of fact. 
    There is then this allegation. 
    The defendant -- this is at page 18. 
    The defendant Orville Hodge, Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Illinois, the defendant, Latham Castle, Attorney General of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, John Gutknecht, States Attorney of Cook County, Illinois have threatened that any attempt by plaintiffs to operate the business of selling and issuing money orders under their firm name, either through offices wholly owned and operated by them or by means of operators of drug, hardware and grocery stores as agents of the plaintiffs or by both such means will bring down upon plaintiffs action by said defendants in the Courts of the State of Illinois to prevent such continuance of such business and for the enforcement of the provisions of State of Illinois, Community Currency Exchanged Act by criminal prosecution. 
    That, at page 29 of the record, is this admission and the answer. 
    They admit they threatened to enforce the said statute against the plaintiffs, if the latter violated the same, but alleged that said threats were general and specifically, and not specifically directed against any particular conduct of the plaintiffs. 
    That at the time they made said threats, the plaintiffs have either not violated the said statute or these defendants were not apprised of any violation. 
    That these defendants were not informed of any such violations until the amended complaint informed them of the same. 
    That these defendants have thus far, taken no legal steps against the plaintiffs to enforce the said statute, and since this suit has been pending in the United States District Court, no proceeding has been brought in the state courts. 
    The state courts have not now required no jurisdiction over the matter. 
    Now, that's the first count. 
    That's by the three plaintiffs constituting this partnership. 
    They're the ones that alleged that they have this license from the people who have copyrighted and have certain forms that they sell for the purpose of selling this money orders, a system of making reports and -- and keeping records etcetera.

    Is the company operating them, Mr. Yowell?
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="650.707" stopTime="664.258">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    At this moment, it is not, Your Honor, but it was at the time the suit was filed and for some little time after. 
    That was one agent in Illinois. 
    In other words, there was a justiciable controversy, it wasn't just someone saying --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="664.258" stopTime="664.508">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="664.508" stopTime="779.397">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    -- “We like to do it and will you please tell us whether we can do it or not, the case, we should go ahead and do it.” 
    The second count, the plaintiff is -- now, Mr. Derrick, the plaintiff, Derrick who alleges, readopts all the allegations of the first count and he alleges that he has -- is now operating and has for many years operate the drug store at Whitten, Illinois. 
    And that he obtained a lot sublicense from the other plaintiffs. 
    And as soon as he obtain that sublicense, he wrote a letter to the Auditor of Public Accounts, defendant auditor who is the administrative in charged of the enforcement of the Act, and he told the auditor in his letter, this is submitted and the letter is an exhibit of the record, “That I have got this sublicense to sell these money orders in my drug store, and I understand that this statute would prohibit that, and I think that statute is unconstitutional and deprives me of the equal protection of the law under the United States Constitution. 
    And as soon as I get my supplies, therefore, I'm going to proceed to sell these money orders in my drug store, just like I used to sell American Express money orders in my drug store. 
    We didn't have to have a licence because statute didn't apply to me then.” 
    And the evidence is clear, I know I think it's submitted here that he did proceed to sell them. 
    A number of the money orders that he actually sold are in the record. 
    Now, those are the material allegations of the complaint that are either admitted or supported by findings of fact.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="779.397" stopTime="781.712">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any response to that letter?
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="781.712" stopTime="928.294">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    There was not, Your Honor. 
    Now, in the Court's opinion, the Court started by saying, after stating who the parties were and that the defendants filed answers and the evidence was aduced for their respective parties. 
    An amicus curiae makes the contention which has been adapted by the defendants, and incidentally, was adapted by the Court, that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the question of constitutionality raised by plaintiffs because that question has never been presented to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    And hence, the federal courts are without jurisdiction to determine it in the first instance, citing Spector Motor Company versus McLaughlin 323 U.S., and Federation of Labor versus McAdory 325 U.S. 
    Neither of which was a three-judge court case. 
    The Spector Motor case was asserted in the District Court of Connecticut, which asked for a declaratory judgment in accordance with the Connecticut law, and also, purported to raise a federal question as to the validity of that Connecticut statute. 
    The District Court in that case found that the – there was no federal question involved because the statute didn't apply to the plaintiffs at all. 
    And on appeal, the Court of Appeal said, “Well, yes, it does apply to the -- to the plaintiff, but the statute is valid.” 
    And the case came here and this Court said, “Well, here is the District Court, may had interpreted one way and the Court of Appeals determines another way and we can't tell it's very big and we don't know what it is if it's -- if it's so vague and if it doesn't apply to the plaintiff at all, then there is no federal question.” 
    They sent it back and they said, “The District Court of course had jurisdiction,” but they should hold it until it find out what the law means in the state court. 
    Now, the District Court --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="928.294" stopTime="931.129">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Isn't that your test of Illinois?
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="931.129" stopTime="1229.702">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    Yes, it has Your Honor. 
    It has been held valid in Illinois that some question as to the character of the business that the plaintiffs were doing in that particular case. 
    The Illinois Court has flatly said that this Act is valid. 
    It doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    They cited in a case in which two of the plaintiffs were partnership who are engaged only in the check cashing business. 
    The third plaintiff was engaged in the check cashing business, but he was also engaged in selling checks. 
    There is a customer coming by, check to pay the light bill and he write his check and send it to the light company. 
    He said, “That's not selling money orders, but if it is selling money orders, then this act is discriminatory against me. 
    Let's see, American Express Company do things that I can't do.” 
    The Supreme Court of Illinois said, “Well, that's – that's selling money orders all right. 
    It didn't matter the form of it, whether it's a check or whatever it is. 
    It's an order on somebody to pay, and it's a money order all right.” 
    But the court said, “This act is valid because there's a reasonable basis for this classification, because this American Express Company is a nationally big organization and not a community currency exchange. 
    And therefore, the act is perfectly valid.” 
    Now, I'll come to that again. 
    I don't want to evade that question, Your Honor, but I'll come back to that. 
    Now, the District Court said, after describing these activities with the American Express, the plaintiff and after reciting the statute, pointing out that in effect, that the plaintiff is within the definition of a community currency exchange, whereas American Express is excluded from it. 
    It does appears that plaintiff's intend to engage in only one phase of the activities in which a community currency exchange may engage if licensed under the Act in question. 
    That is, the business of selling or issuing money orders under their name. 
    It also appears that American Express Company, which is exempt from the operation of this Act, is engaging in the same activity. 
    It further appears that plaintiffs intend to and American Express Company does engaged in his business through agents operating retail stores of the same types. 
    Now, the Court proceeded then to say this, at page 506 of the record. 
    The plaintiffs argued that, “It is the function and duty of this Court to determine whether or not the Act in question violates the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to these plaintiffs.” 
    On the other hand, the amicus curiae and the defendants argued that it is not the function and duty of this Court to determine that question, unless and until plaintiffs secure an answer to that question from the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    And the Court then says, “It would seem that a plausible argument could be made on behalf of the plaintiffs to the Illinois Supreme Court predicated upon the fact that the identical similarity of the business conducted by American Express Company, which is exempt from regulation under the Act, and then in which plaintiffs intend to engage and which on its phase, the Act says, “It must be regulated from the State,” is an arbitrary discrimination. 
    If this argument were made to and accepted as valid by the Illinois Supreme Court, it might well grant the plaintiffs the very relief which they're seeking in this Court, and hence, a suit of this character would be unnecessary. 
    In other words, if the plaintiffs went to the Supreme Court of Illinois and they got a decision there that this Act is valid and doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States, I assume from the Court's opinion they could then come into the three-judge District Court and have a review of the Supreme Court of Illinois, but that is the function of this Court, not a three-judge courts which as I understand it are given by Congress jurisdiction in this very kind of suit. 
    And I know of no case and the dissenting judge, Judge Hoffman said he was aware of no decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States has held that a Federal District Court must or even should refuse to entertain a suit under the circumstances present here.

    Suppose the Supreme Court of Illinois should, under the separability clause of this Act say, if the exemption is -- would then be -- be alright? 
    You and I, the plaintiff, work it out. 
    Suppose they say the exception clause and only the Illinois Supreme Court could say that. 
    Well, this Court has held the question of whether the state statute may be saved by cutting out or challenge the provision of the question from the state court, not with this Court.

    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    If -- if Your Honor please, the State Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Illinois has already, in the case to which I referred, said that this statute would not have been passed by the legislature.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If it was asked, then you say Illinois has already said that that provision is bad, the whole must fall. 
    That's a different story.
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="1334.551" stopTime="1335.599">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    That's right. 
    Well, that's -- that is the case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1335.599" stopTime="1336.525">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is it your --
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="1336.525" stopTime="1404.388">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    I -- I was approaching it, giving you the wrong answer first and perhaps the weaker answer first, but at any rate, that is the case. 
    Now, furthermore, Your Honor, I want to answer that just a little bit further. 
    This – this exemption is set forth in a definition of the word community currency exchange, and that expression, community currency exchange so defined, occurs I think at 62 times in 20 different sections of this Act. 
    So that when you emasculate a part of this definition, you change the meaning of the word community currency exchanges and at least 20 sections of this Act, so that it couldn't conceivably be a separable provision that could stand on its own and allow the rest remain without being affected. 
    And the Supreme Court of Illinois, in the McDougall case has said that surely the legislature would never have passed this Act, if it had applied that they'd meant for it to apply at all to the American Express.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1404.388" stopTime="1405.707">

    McDougall case.
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="1405.707" stopTime="1551.068">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    McDougall versus Lueder, yes Your Honor. 
    Now, the District Court went on to say, “But whether in a plaintiff situation, the Illinois Supreme Court would hold the exemption of American Express Company from the application of the Act, constitutional or unconstitutional, we do not know.” 
    And they say that unless, until that's decided, they don't know where they are and they say, “Hence, we can not decide the constitutional question presented in the absence of such authoritative determination by the Illinois Supreme Court.” 
    Then, they said on the next page, “The Illinois Supreme Court might find that to deny the plaintiffs of that right would be to deprive them of the same protection which American Express Company enjoys under the law.” 
    It well may be that the Illinois Supreme Court would hold the exception of American Express Company unconstitutional as applied to persons in the position of these plaintiffs. 
    Now, I think it a fair conclusion from the opinion and from statements the Court made at the conclusion of the trial that this Court thought the plaintiffs were entitled to relief. 
    They favored the plaintiffs on the merits, but they thought that is the majority thoughts that they didn't have a jurisdiction to give the relief which should be given because the Court said this, "A three-judge, court in a case involving a similar situation arising under the Currency Exchange Act of the State of Wisconsin, held that the exception of American Express Company rendered the statute discriminatory and unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff in that case, Currency Services verus Matthews, U.F. Supp. 40 at 43, 45.” 
    However, there, no question was raised as to the federal court's jurisdiction, such as the question which now confronts us. 
    In other words, I take it what the Court was intending to say that the Court didn't pass on the question of jurisdiction, which I had thought, in the very rendering of the decision and necessarily passed on their jurisdiction, but that is the only distinction, otherwise, this Court is disposed to follow that.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if the -- if the suggestion that after the McDougall case decided by the Illinois Supreme Court and that -- that was decided in January 17, 1945 and after that decision, the Illinois Supreme Court and Wisconsin District Court was rendered, is that right?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, and the suggestion is that since the exception clause that it seems to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause that are now has an element, wasn't before the Supreme Court of Illinois at the time of the refusal to take and confronted with determination by a federal court that that violates the Equal Protection Clause, they may now change their minds, they were – actually, the federal authority stood about it, we will never let – never let that the statute stand. 
    What about that, isn't that the suggestion?
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="1616.381" stopTime="1620.749">
    Mr. John J. Yowell

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1620.749" stopTime="1628.161">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And therefore as it were, therefore as it were, the Illinois Supreme Court has not ruled out the merits that he is not a citizen.

    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    Not so far as one in the position of these plaintiffs is concerned. 
    That's perfectly true, but in the -- in the case in Wisconsin, in which Judge Lindley wrote the opinion, Currency Services versus Matthews, there had been no decision whatsoever of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin construing the Wisconsin's statute and -- but – but this Court says, "Well, that's -- that's true but then this question of jurisdiction wasn't raised there." 
    In other words, the inferences, if the question had been raised there then, you can't determine the Constitution now to this because the Wisconsin Court hasn't passed on the constitutionality, then -- then the Court would have had the same thing to do that this Court did here. 
    They have to say, “Well, we can't pass on the constitutionality and the state -- until the state court does. 
    Now, we -- there's no question about it, if the statute is not clear as to either its meaning or as to its application. 
    The state court is the one that determines that, or if there's some question about its separability and as I say, particularly the case coming from the -- from the state courts and I, with all do deference to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I believe that I can cite the court cases where this Court has undertaken to determine the question of separability and cases coming from the federal court.

    I think it comes awfully close. 
    I think -- and the language of the Court as Judge Hoffman said in his dissent, the plaintiffs supported for the decision of another three-judge court in Currency Services versus Matthews, have raised a substantial federal constitutional question. 
    The application of the challenged statute to the plaintiffs is unquestioned, and the Supreme Court of Illinois has already upheld the exemption of American Express Company without suggesting that its decision in any way rested on the nature of the activities of the plaintiffs in the decided case, McDougall versus Leuder. 
    Then he says, “The balance between the State and federal relations is not so delicate that it would be upset by this Court's consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs' claim that the Illinois Currency Exchange Act has deprived them of the equal protection of the laws.” 
    Now, I said that their conclusion from the opinion and from the Court's statements, the conclusion of the trial, I think was just -- which is that the Court thought the plaintiff should have relief, the plaintiff should have relief. 
    At page 97 of the record, Judge Schnackenberg said this, “I have a question I'd like to ask Mr. Wines and his associates from the States Attorney's Office. 
    It is a little bit out of order in the way of taking things up seriatim chronologically. 
    That may take -- that may point to some thought that it's in the Court's mind which it caused you in your whole argument -- oral argument to direct your argument of what you think the Court may be thinking about among other things. 
    Here is a question I'd like you to listen to very carefully if you will. 
    Suppose the state legislature enacts a statute, providing for a state inspection of all weighing scales used in retail food shops to be evidenced by adhesive stamp, affixed by the inspector of this scale and providing that the owner should pay a fee for inspection and keep the stamp affixed for public exhibition and use no unstamped scale in his shop, and also providing penalties for violating a statute. 
    And further providing that the statute should not apply to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company shops and the scales they're in. 
    If an owner of four or five retail food shops challenges the constitutionality of the statute as violative of the Federal Constitution's due process and equal protection of the law provisions, should the Court sustain that challenge?” 
    Well, Mr. Wines answered that at page 99, “Now, to come back specifically to the hypothetical case put by Your Honor, Judge Schnackenberg, I would say that if there were only one grocery's chain of such worldwide establishment that exempting that chain might very well be constitutional.” 
    Then he says, “I don't think that that is the situation in the grocery store business. 
    So, just to answer your question, yes or no, I would say that the question that, Your Honor puts, the Act would be unconstitutional but that it is distinguishable.” 
    Now, then, the friend of the Court upon whom the Court relied --

    (Voice Overlap) anything outside the record. 
    I just wondered if --
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="1976.455" stopTime="2108.632">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    So far as the record is concerned, that's -- that I think is correct. 
    Now, he undertook to answer this question that the Court had propounded about the Great Atlantic -- Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and he says at page 113 of the record, “Now, if for instance, it is a fact that the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company had never had a case where they had been accused of false weighing and they have never, by some ingenious method of their own, they cannot possibly make a mistake in that regard, then that differentiation would be valid because the legislature is not supposed to encompass all degrees of people that it may seek to remedy by its legislation. 
    If on the other hand, it is fair to presume that the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company is only human and they do make mistakes in their machines, frequently, they are too busy to have their machines corrected. 
    Why then, it is quite obvious that there is no factual basis for that discrimination, and if there is no factual basis for that discrimination, of course, the discrimination or the classification would be invalid.” 
    Now, let's see what about this human element in this case. 
    At page 361, appears the deposition of Mr. Smith, the Executive Vice President of the American Express Company. 
    Question, “I believe you said that the creditor of various agents varies some or more responsible perhaps another, is that right? 
    Answer, “That is right.” 
    Question, “I suppose human nature being what it is, sometimes an agent goes wrong, is not that right?” 
    Answer, “Occasionally, yes sir.” 
    Question, “Suppose, Mr. Smith, an agent in the State of Illinois does go wrong and he disappeared and checks start coming in and out of the float? 
    I believe that refund was the term and you have reason to believe from some information you receive that perhaps the agent was in cahoots, let's say, with some people of his and that some of these money orders that are presented for payment are not legitimate. 
    Has anything like that -- ever happened?

    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    No, I didn't make myself clear. 
    Strictly speaking, the only question before this Court, the really one question, did the Court have jurisdiction? 
    And perhaps secondly, and I think this is in it. 
    Should the Court have exercised the jurisdiction which it had? 
    Those are the only two questions, as I conceive it, that are before this Court.

    Mr. John J. Yowell

    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    Well, I say that the only questions before this Court are, one, was the Court right or wrong in saying it had no jurisdiction? 
    And two, assuming it had jurisdiction, should that in this character case exercise that jurisdiction? 
    Now, the argument was made here that the Court shouldn't exercise its jurisdiction because it -- it's not time to do it where they say that the -- because the state court hasn't passed on it, but there's no suggestion anywhere in this record that there's anything indefinite about this Act, that it isn't perfectly clear and is to its -- that it doesn't apply to the plaintiffs. 
    They've made the threat against the plaintiffs. 
    They admitted the file to the complaints. 
    So, there's nothing for any state court to do in a way of clarification either the meaning of the application of the statute.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I would hope that the Court would write an opinion which would clarify the law as to this jurisdictional matter and if the Court would direct the Court to enter a -- to take their action in accordance to this opinion. 
    Now, I suppose technically, the Court could change their minds from what I thought it was and say, “Well, we think that this -- this plea here of an -- of your not coming in with clean hands is a good plea.” 
    We perhaps didn't think so before but we now make a finding that it's good and so you're up because of that, and I want to refer just very briefly to that.

    I'm not saying it wouldn't be on the denial of equal protection.

    Now, if I'm wrong about that, then I suppose this Court would send it back to the Court and say, “You do have jurisdiction if that the Court finds they do.” 
    I don't know that they will, but if this Court finds that the District Court had jurisdiction, it seems to me that the Court might go further than to say, “Now, determine whether or not this statute is valid so that it can come up to us again and we can pass on that.” 
    I should think the statute is here and it's presented and the findings of fact are made which presents the very issue, and it's true the Court said they had no jurisdiction but I think that the Court clearly did have jurisdiction and I think that it would become contrary to every decision that I have read, if you said they do not have, that they did not have. 
    Now, the -- this argument, I didn't want to stop that. 
    I -- I don't want to leave that subject if the Court has any further questions. 
    Now, the -- there was this issue here and it's attempted to be presented to this Court that because on these money orders which were copyrighted or registered form, there was the statement, “license and bonded” that that is somehow a representation to the public that these -- these plaintiffs are licensed under the Illinois statute which they have urged statute they're challenging. 
    And the form of the money order appears at page 224 of the record and it shows on its phase that these money orders are issued under a license that Bondified money order service operated under license granted to Bondified Systems. 
    Following the word “Bondified” is an asterisk. 
    Down at the bottom, it says, abbreviated, registered U.S. patent dollars. 
    The left of that, it says, “Checks Incorporated Minneapolis, Minnesota,” and above that is this trademark, “Bondified money transfer.” 
    And that's all the evidence there is in this record that indicates that there's anybody that -- that anybody has made any representations, and under the decisions we've cited in our reply brief, a license, the definition of a license is not limited to a license from the State and these were licensed and these people were bonded, and we say that there was no misrepresentation there in any way and the court below -- that did not take that seriously and refused to make the final fact upon it. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William C. Wines

    Very well. 
    Mr. Wines.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    May it please the Court. 
    Your Honors, I should like to begin or rather precede my argument with a narrative exposition of the history of the legislation, the facts in the case, the judicial proceedings ultimating in the judgment in opinion now before Your Honors for review. 
    I think when that narration is made, the questions properly presented and knows what Your Honors made but would not be obliged to entertain will emerge very clearly. 
    Your Honors, for some reason which is not only is undisclosed by the record, but which I haven't been able to learn on or off the record. 
    In the depression of 1933, currency exchanges have become amazingly more popular in Illinois than in any other state in the union. 
    Nobody seems to know why that's true, but it is an interesting economic phenomenon. 
    They've had some unusual vitality in California and New York but it's become a very large industry in Illinois. 
    So, Illinois passed a Currency Exchange Act as now amended and is before this Court, it declares currency exchanges to be effective with the public interest and intimately integrated in the economic fabric of Illinois. 
    It licenses them. 
    It regulates them. 
    Provides for revocation of licenses in the case of failure to comply with regulations, and in general, stepped in a particular of this exemption. 
    The law is not challenged by these appellants as a valid and constitutional regulatory major.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Yes. 
    I'll be happy to do that, Your Honor. 
    I plan to argue first that the trial court was correct in remitting the plaintiffs, the appellants to the state courts, although, the expression that it lacked jurisdiction is ambiguous and I don't intend to concede that the Court meant or if it did mean that it was correct in meaning, that it lacked federal jurisdiction of a Fourteenth Amendment question if substantial or of $3000 or anything of that sort. 
    I plan to argue that they meant that in light of well settled principles they should forbear the exercise of federal equitable jurisdiction in this cause.

    I'm going to argue that if -- first is I'm going to insist that the -- that they reached the correct result in remitting the cause to the Illinois Court. 
    I'm going to argue that if the --

    I mean remitting the parties, not the cause. 
    Of course they couldn't transfer the case as this Court can and the Court of Appeals. 
    I meant in telling the parties to recur, repair to the Illinois in tribunals. 
    I'm going to argue that if the merits are before this Court, were before the District Court, this Court can. 
    This Court has the jurisdiction to decide this case on the merits without remanding, and I'm going to ask with all the earnestness that I can that although ordinarily, this Court won't do it in this case when I have made my expository merit. 
    I hope to persuade Your Honors that the -- the facts in this case are so clear that it will not require a canvass of this record. 
    In fact, it will exempt to require an examination of only one page of this record, which I'll come to later, and that to remand the case to the District Court, three-judge District Court would in this particular case do not generally be a work of pure supererogation, but I can't support that argument until I've made my narrative of that.

    I -- I think -- I think that's -- that's correct, but that the reasons why I'm knowing for well what's in Your Honor's mind in having had the benefit of Your Honor's colloquy with Mr. Yowell, the reason why I'm still so earnestly asking this will become apparent when I'm through with my narration of the facts, which will put the case, I think, in a different light from what it is now. 
    Well, now, in enacting this Currency Exchange Act, the general assembly of Illinois defines a currency exchange in substance as any concern that either cashing checks for a fee or issues money orders for a fee or does both of those things. 
    There are some other provisions in the definition but nobody raises any question about them so that would suffice for this Court's consideration now.

    They don't charge an Illinois bank. 
    It doesn't charge a depositor. 
    I don't think it does. 
    I don't know of any Illinois bank that charges for cashing a check. 
    There are some banks that charge you for every check that you write and don't require you to have a minimum. 
    But generally speaking, no, the Illinois banks do not charge for cashing checks.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="3390.968" stopTime="3393.446">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    And people go to these exchanges and pay for it?

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    They do. 
    Nobody knows why, but they do. 
    Now, I mean why in Illinois but -- but they -- but they do. 
    Now, well, it is a convenience and many people don't have banking facilities and they're -- they operate on -- on Saturdays and I don't think they operate on Sundays. 
    Now, the Illinois Act does exempt by name, the Western Union Telegraph Company, the Postal Telegraph Company, the American Express Company and of course, the United States Post Office. 
    I wish to make it very clear that we do not try to collect license fees from the United States Post Office. 
    Now, when the Act -- when the Act was first passed, the operators of currency exchanges and -- and not those just engaged in the cashing of checks. 
    Mr. Yowell's memory hasn't served incorrectly in the McDougall case that plaintiffs were engaged in the operation of community currency exchanges in which they sold money orders. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court did say that the exemption of the American Express Company was constitutional, and did make the observation which was a dictum and which was a dictum, not made in the light of the record that's been made here, and not made in the light of a subsequent federal decision coming from Wisconsin. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court did say in the McDougall case that the exemption was constitutional and that the Act would not have been passed had not been possibly exempted. 
    All right, there had been some amendments to the Act but they don't intervene here.

    Yes, but don't you see this difference, Your Honor, if -- that's Your Honors holding it, but it was this three-judge District Court, if these plaintiffs bring their suit in the Illinois and they go to the Illinois Supreme Court, and the Illinois Supreme Court decide adversely to the very direct appeal here, they don't have to face the problem of this Court's discretionary grant of certiorari. 
    If this -- if the Supreme Court of Illinois holds that its exemption is constitutional, and it passes on that or if it holds that its -- or it holds that it's inseparable, it will have to hold that it's constitutional. 
    Then -- then they have a direct -- I mean, they'll have to hold to this constitutional hold or act unconstitutional. 
    But if it upholds the Act and hold this provision inseparable, the plaintiffs will have a right of direct appeal, not certiorari if Your Honors think of that time if the question is substantial. 
    If it holds inseparable and knocks it out, the plaintiff said, they wouldn't want it anyway, so why should the three District -- three-judge District Court hold it.

speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="3926.619" stopTime="4293.930">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Page 224 of the transcript. 
    That's all that I -- I would like to have the Court to look at. 
    Your Honors will see reproduced, the photo stats of the type of money orders that these plaintiffs aver and avow and proclaim that they're going to sell if this injunction is not granted. 
    At the bottom, you will see, it's a little hard, the sort of elliptical ring money transfer to the -- that's -- that's black with white letters. 
    To the immediate left is the word “licensed” and to the immediate right is the word “bonded.” 
    I just like to repeat that. 
    To the immediate left of that black elliptical ring is the word “licensed.” 
    To the immediate right is the word “bonded.” 
    These are -- these money orders are to be sold in Illinois. 
    In Illinois, we have a statute licensing and requiring bonds of all companies, selling money orders except the American Express Company. 
    These plaintiffs are not licensed in Illinois by any Illinois authority and that is admitted in the record and I'm sure Mr. Yowell will admit it here if you ask him. 
    They are not -- they have not filed any bond anywhere to disapprove by any kind of Illinois State surveillance or supervision. 
    Now, to – and that if these checks in the State were the public known generally, that licenses are required and that means a state license and bonds are required and that means a bond approved by the State. 
    When they have no state license, county license, city license, precinct license, federal license or any other kind of license, when they posted no bond with any public official, he is such a gross rod on the public that they ought to be dismissed for want of equity and not coming in with clean hands. 
    Their defense makes it even worst. 
    They say that the word “license” means that they have a licensed to use the trademark, the copyrighted trademark, Bondified, that's their defense. 
    It isn't copyrighted. 
    It isn't trademarked and they have not valid license from the propriety to use it. 
    I will now demonstrate that from the record. 
    They do have a written agreement. 
    It's set forth in the record. 
    When in a western outfit that has registered or in some way or other, they registered the name Bondified as a trademark on a form of check, and they have made a written agreement which is called a license to the plaintiffs, permitting them to use that name but that's a violation of the federal law, because as we explained very clearly in our brief, this Court has held that for the proprietor or trademark to permit another person to use it without guaranteeing the product, if it is a product or the financial responsibility, if it is a business is contrary to the public policy of the United States in trademark, copyright and postal money orders. 
    The pleading case on that and it is not as clearly set forth in our brief as I would -- as I might wish is a -- is the Manhattan Medicine Company case. 
    The facts in that very briefly were these, Your Honor. 
    I can state it briefly but it's all important. 
    The proprietor of a trademark for a medicine, we'll call him Jones, for a consideration allowed Smith to use the trademark. 
    He didn't sell the business. 
    If Mr. Jones had been making Manhattan medicine and sold the business, sold the assets, he wouldn't personally have had to guarantee their continued integrity, but he merely licensed the use of the name without in anyway transferring the business, assuming responsibility for the product either by way of supervising its manufacture and damnifying people for its defect. 
    He attempted to sell goodwill without selling the business and you can't do it as a matter of federal public policy, and there just isn't any question about it. 
    A contract by which one who has built up a trade name undertakes the reward to let another use that name without transferring and apart from the business is -- has been held fraudulent so many times that we say that it isn't necessary to remand it to the District Court or technically, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggest, remand it with an instructions to dismiss for want of equity and lack of clean hands.

    I think it's a matter that can be suggested at anytime or at under any condition and even the Court might wish do it sua sponte rather than leave some illegitimate, but nevertheless potent inference that what the matter in which it could have been presented was not promptly scratched by a judicial expression when the fact is so claimed.

speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="4800.433" stopTime="5033.745">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    We -- we disagree with the -- we disagree with the Wisconsin decision and our -- our reasons are these. 
    The impressive materials that are in this record were not before the Wisconsin Court. 
    The record shows in this case the extent of the American Express Companies' operations that were not shown by any evidence there. 
    It was of world -- it's a worldwide -- the evidence isn't contradicted. 
    It's an enterprise of worldwide dimensions. 
    It is supervised closely by the United States Government. 
    It is – it is the depository of federal funds. 
    It is supervised by the State of New York, and even if there were no other difference between the American Express Company and the plaintiffs, a grandfather clause alone would support -- would suffice to support it. 
    These considerations are impressive. 
    One other point that I wish to make and then I conclude, there is a suggestion in the Wisconsin case that there's something unconstitutional about exempting the American Express Company by name instead of by a set of standards and apparatus such that although, in fact, only the American Express Company might comply with it. 
    In theory, it wouldn't be any reason why you or I couldn't accept that we're a little short of the money or of the connections in foreign countries or some other prerequisite. 
    It's argued that there's something in any -- in the Wisconsin case, there's something unconstitutional about exempting the American Express Company by name. 
    We say that it must presumed and it is the fact that at the present time there is in fact only one concern, the American Express Company that might possibly comply with these standards, that if the time ever comes when these plaintiffs or even some third person complies with the standards and of the American Express Company and is subject to the Act where the American Express Company is exempt because of its name. 
    If that time ever comes, which it's possible to conceive but difficult to believe, the -- that will be the time to say that a question of discrimination has been raised. 
    Now, we respectfully submit that the Court should affirm the trial court's decision in this case.

    That money order isn't all wrong.
speaker="john_j_yowell" startTime="5128.359" stopTime="5399.188">
    Mr. John J. Yowell 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The -- we're talking about little money orders here that averaged $5 or $10, if people pay their light bills already, and the maximum is a $100. 
    The average of all the money orders in American Express sales is $10 according to the -- their chief officer. 
    And this Bonafide System sales money orders in various different states as the record shows and Illinois is the only one now that has this prohibition and regulates the business of money order sales and it exempts the American Express Company, and all the other states, they use the same money order which says that they're licensed here from these checks incorporated and they are bonded and they are licensed. 
    And I was about to read the evidence on that, but I'm not going to go into that because we have said in our reply brief that this Court is asked to weigh evidence and make findings which the District Court refused to make and fail to make and made in contrary to have in findings that it did make. 
    And that this Court has asked to draw inferences which the District Court refused to draw on this question of -- of coming in with clean hands. 
    Now, I want to call the Court's attention to -- of the decision in the Toomer case which was the fishery case where the shippers were of Georgia for complaining to cross South Carolina, wouldn't let them. 
    Well, they imposed a very large license fees on their shrimping in the waters of North Carolina. 
    And they challenged that statute and this Court said that statute deprived them of the equal protection of the laws, and the -- the claim was made to that case by the Attorney General of North Carolina. 
    It's North Carolina or South Carolina that these plaintiffs, these shrimpers are coming in here, saying that their shrimping business was being discriminated against that were convicts. 
    They had repeatedly been convicted of shrimping contrary to the -- to the law and they -- they have served sentences for it. 
    And this Court said this, “Some of the individual appellants have previously been convicted of shrimping out of season and into waters. 
    The District Court held that this previous misconduct, not have any relation to the constitutionality of the challenged statutes did not call for application of the clean hands maxim. 
    We agree.” 
    Now, that's all what I want to say on that point. 
    I want to say so far as the -- the exercise of federal equity jurisdiction is concerned, of course, this Court has always held that the Court will not come in just to -- to enjoin the -- the enforcement of the federal statute, but the exception is, if there is danger, immediate danger of irreparable injury, they will do so. 
    That's what they did in this Toomer versus Witsell case which is cited in our brief and we cited number of other cases at pages 11 and 12 of the brief for the appellants. 
    Here are men engaged, the citizens of Illinois engaged in a business. 
    During the year before this trial, they showed that they've sold a $1,400,000 worth of these money orders in Northern Indiana under the same licensure operating under in Chicago. 
    Sure, they only got one agent. 
    They had to have a case. 
    They had to -- have a justiciable case. 
    They couldn't get in as a corporation because there was an arrangement made between the Secretary of State Office and this Audito, this is in the record. 
    So, they've -- they couldn't stop it from acting as individuals. 
    They couldn't give -- wouldn't give them corporate license in Illinois so they couldn't get in, couldn't have any standard, but they operated as individuals and they did the best they could. 
    And we submit, Your Honor that the -- the jurisdiction is clear. 
    These people have been deprived and everyday they're prevented from operating. 
    They're losing money, and now, it said they have to go to the state court or the State Supreme Court and again come up here, in the meantime that the laws is irremedial because you never could get it back from the State or anyone else, and it does come within the exception and is supported by the cases, we contend that is cited in our brief. 
    Thank you very much.
