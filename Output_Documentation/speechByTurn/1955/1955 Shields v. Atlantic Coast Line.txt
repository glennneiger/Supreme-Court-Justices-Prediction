Shields v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="0.000" stopTime="501.478">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    The petitioner was an independent contractor engaged in the business of unloading tank cars of gasoline for delivery to local consignees of that gas in Montgomery. 
    The petitioner, Mr. Shields, went upon the tank car that, from which he suffered his injury, called the purpose of unloading this gasoline. 
    It is necessary on the type of the tank car that he was working upon for him to climb to the dome of the tank which is some 10 feet in the air to release the -- open the dome and to turn the valve. 
    There is a board there at the top of a short ladder, right there at the dome, which is put there for the primary purpose of having people stand there while they do the operation that petitioner was about to do. 
    This board was admittedly so rotten that it crumbles in your hand. 
    When petitioner stepped upon this board, it fell to the ground and he fell with it, suffering severe injuries to his back, and was permanently injured. 
    The case went to the jury, the District Court lay on Montgomery on two counts of a complaint, one sounding in common law of negligence, the other relying on the Safety Appliance Act. 
    The jury rendered a general verdict in the amount of $7500 and the District Court affirmed it. 
    The case then was appealed to the Court of Appeals in New Orleans. 
    That Court found that it could not determine whether the jury had decided then on the ground of common law of negligence or on the ground of Safety Appliance Act and sets in the view of the Court of Appeals. 
    The Safety Appliance Act was not properly invoked. 
    It remanded the case to the District Court for trial on common law negligence grounds alone. 
    It was the theory of the Court of Appeals that the failure of the I.C.C. to issue any regulations standardizing this appliance, which we call a running board, was conclusive proof of an administrative determination that this board was not a safety appliance. 
    It was from that judgment of the Court of Appeals that this petition of certiorari was filed and that the case is now here. 
    Now the -- our case is very simply stated, the theory on which we rely for recovery is this, the Section 11 of the Safety Appliance Act states that all cars requiring secure ladders and running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards. 
    This was a running board, it was insecure and rotten. 
    Petitioner stepped on it and fell to the painful injuries which there's no dispute about. 
    Now, to this simple statement of our theory of recovery, the defendant has -- our respondent here has raised three defenses which we'd like to discuss with the Court. 
    The first defense raised by respondent is that this is not a running board because it was not standardized by the I.C.C. 
    And respondent, in his brief, condemns petitioner for what he calls petitioner's persistent assumption that this was a running board. 
    And an answer to that is simply this, that the Railroad was just as persistent in calling this a running board until the railroad was confronted with a violation of those -- with the Safety Appliance Act provisions about having a running board secured. 
    The railroads repair order, which was put in evidence in this case, showed that the railroad called it a dome running board. 
    The superintendent of the railroad in answering interrogatories propounded to the railroad by the petitioner, Shields, answered no less than seven times calling this a running board. 
    Even on the trial, the counsel saw the railroad and witnesses called by the railroad referred to it on more than one occasion as a running board. 
    This idea that it's not a running board is something fair at length that has been thought of by the railroad and the railroad is upset because petitioner won't join the railroad in its inconsistency. 
    But the sole basis on which the railroad relies in its contention that this is not a running board is the absence of any regulations on the subject by the I.C.C. 
    And as we shall demonstrate the failure of the I.C.C. to standardize this appliance has absolutely no significance in determining whether this is in fact the running board. 
    The I.C.C. has filed a brief in this case in which it acknowledges that the ladder which goes to this running board is also not standardized. 
    Now, the I.C.C. doesn't contend that that ladder is in a lesser ladder because of its failure to standardize it. 
    And we can't see why this running board should be designated as any lesser running board because of its failure to standardize. 
    The I.C.C. contends that it has failed to standardize this appliance because it is not an appliance which is primarily used in the movement of a train. 
    And we want to discuss in a few minutes the -- what we think is the erroneous ground for not so regarding it as a safety appliance, that is the ground offered by the I.C.C. 
    We think that when Congress used the term "running board", it must have used it with reference to railroad pallets. 
    Now, the term was designated in railroad pallets and this record as has already been shown is full of evidence, almost without dispute, that this appliance is known in railroad pallets as the running board. 
    There is some evidence in the record that some employees call it a dome step board, and in that connection, Webster's New International Dictionary defines a running board as a clip board. 
    So, we think that the term is certainly synonymous but the evidence also is clear in the record that the car inspector with 25 years of experience on the railroad says that it's always -- it's known by him as a dome running board or a top running board. 
    So there was adequate evidence for the trial court to have found as it did find that this was the running board and submit the question of whether that running board was secure to the jury. 
    Now, I think the principal argument of the I.C.C. -- of the railroad here, however, is that even if this be a running board, the omission of the I.C.C. to standardize it means that it is not a safety appliance. 
    Now, this contention is based on the railroad's conception that when Congress gave in Section 12, the authority to the I.C.C. to standardized these appliances that it was also giving to the I.C.C. the right to say which appliances shall be secured. 
    We point out, however, that Section 11 of the Act just simply says all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards. 
    And then, Section 12 gives the I.C.C. the right to standardize those appliances. 
    We submit that the railroad is omitting to note the interplay of these two sections.

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    We think --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="523.981" stopTime="528.839">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Which -- which section is it that says the I.C.C. shall issue the regulations?
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="528.839" stopTime="622.205">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Section 12. 
    That -- that says the number, dimensions, location and manner of application of the appliances provided for by Section 4 and 11, this title is designated by the Interstate Commerce Commission shall remain as the standards of equipment to be used on all cars subject to the provisions of Section 11 and 16 of this title. 
    And then down further, it says that failure to comply with any requirement of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be subject to a light penalty as failure to comply with any requirement of Sections 11 and 16 of this title. 
    So, we submit that Congress clearly had its eye on two -- two enables. 
    One was the failure of railroads in many cases to keep these appliances secure and that's what Section 11 was designed to prevent. 
    Section 12 was designed to prevent the evil of not having these appliances standardized so that on a dark night of railroad employee might reach for a handhold that he might think should be there or a running board that is ordinarily there and might not be. 
    So those were the two enables but we submit that by giving as -- the I.C.C. the authority to standardize these appliances, there was no intent on Congress, whatsoever, to take it away from its clear command in Section 11 that running boards and ladders be maintained in a secure condition.

    There's -- I think the only thing in the record on that point is that some cars do not have this running board near the dome.

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Yes, sir. 
    And it's the contention of this Court of -- it was the view of the Court of Appeals this contention of the railroad that that omission to standardize that appliance that on the -- on the top of the -- of the tank car makes it not a safety appliance. 
    But we contend that Section 11 which says, "All cars requiring secure running board shall be equipped with such running boards isn't clear to men regardless of what the I.C.C. does about the standardization of this appliance." 
    Now, I point out in connection with this interplay of these two sections --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="771.818" stopTime="778.706">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does that mean that -- it is the compulsory under the statute to provide the board in controversy?

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    No, sir. 
    It -- it is their view that it is not compulsory and we think that there are practical reasons why the I.C.C. may not wish to standardize this particular board because the --

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    No, sir. 
    We would think it would not be necessary to have any board particularly if you don't take the oil out or gasoline out without going to the top. 
    Now, we think --

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    As a matter of fact, many of the tank cars have ladders, don't they?

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    No, sir. 
    It's come up with the record but there's only one picture. 
    Now, we think the Williams case had some light on this problem. 
    This was a case which -- this Court decided when the -- a man was injured when a ladder broke and he -- at the time of his injury, there had been no I.C.C. orders promulgated at all. 
    And it was the contention of the railroad in that case that in the absence of any I.C.C. regulations, there couldn't be any liability. 
    But this Court committing upon the difference between the section of -- what we now called Section 11 and Section 12 says that as to Section 11, there is an imperative statute -- an absolute and imperative statutory -- statutory duty of making them secure. 
    And then it goes on to discuss the other responsibility under the next section of standardizing. 
    But even in the absence of any I.C.C. regulations, this Court in the Williams case held that those appliances had to be maintained secure.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="918.726" stopTime="932.112">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I understand that although the statute doesn't require it and they need not have had it, never let the State do have it and something happens there with absent liability, is that it?

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Well, the statute says -- the statute says all cars requiring secure running board shall be equipped with such. 
    Now, it's our contention, and in the Williams case, this Court uses the language requiring for their proper use. 
    And the Court goes on to say that the ladder in the Williams case, the type of box car was it did require for its proper use, the ladder. 
    And therefore, it had to be saved.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, let's see if I understand you. 
    I understood your answer even my question wasn't clear.

    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Well, I -- I should say --I should -- should answer it this way that Safety Appliance Act says that in -- in -- and then I view it that -- in reading it with the Williams case that if the running board is required for the -- for the efficient use of the car, then it must be secured.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1000.388" stopTime="1008.458">

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1300.055" stopTime="1303.436">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Of course, it doesn't read on legal argument by law.
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="1303.436" stopTime="1542.143">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Well, let me go just a minute into the reason advanced by the I.C.C. for this thing. 
    As I say, in fact, I think they're incorrect in saying that this board is not using the movement of cars. 
    The evidence in the record from a car inspector with 25 years experience was it -- it frequently mean when I found this board to pass hand signals that if it -- if the dome top on this car became loose in the movement of the train and if the railroad employee might have to go up there to -- and he'd seen employees have to go up there to tap that thing down with gasoline on the inside and its dome tank. 
    Not racking up and down, I think the Court can readily see the necessity for getting up there in such a circumstance. 
    But the main thing that the I.C.C. says is not supported by anything in the language of the statute. 
    If Congress said they intended only those running boards used in the movement of a car to be standardized, Congress clearly could have so stated. 
    It is true, as the I.C.C. says in its brief, I supposed, that Congress had its attention primarily focused on the toll of accidents that occurred to employees on moving trains. 
    But Congress didn't seem fit to say that only running boards used in the movement of trains were covered by the Act. 
    The I.C.C. has simply -- with -- by sharing interest inserted those words in there. 
    I think Congress was aware that a fall from the top of a -- top running board was just as serious as a fall from a bottom running board and would never have made the -- inserted the words of the I.C.C. has cited -- isn't cited in there. 
    Now, I'd like to mention for just a minute, the argument of the railroad and the I.C.C. that the words in Section 11 where it says that all cars requiring secure running boards means all cars required by the I.C.C. to have secure running boards. 
    There again, they have simply inserted into the act language that Congress didn't seem fit to insert for itself. 
    We think, if you read these -- these sections -- Section 11 as a whole, it's readily apparent what Congress had in mind by the use of the word requiring. 
    It said all cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient handbrakes. 
    All cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such because all cars do not require ladders and running boards. 
    A gondola car, for example, has no running board on it, and Congress was not attempting to require the railroad to go to useless expense and put running boards where it -- where they weren't needed. 
    And again, in the Williams case, the Court gave the language requiring, we submit its proper interpretation which was cars requiring for their proper use. 
    These running boards shall be equipped with such. 
    And the last comment I'd like to make on that construction is that the tense of the word "requiring" would be all wrong. 
    If Congress in Section 11 were referencing regulations of the I.C.C. because at the time Congress wrote Section 11, there were no regulations by the I.C.C. 
    So, if they'd any I.C.C. regulations in mind, they certainly would have said because -- which shall be required to have secure running boards. 
    So we submit that the omission of the I.C.C. to standardize this appliance cannot take away the protection that Congress was plainly trying to give employees in Section 11 that railroads must maintain running boards in a secure manner.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Mr. Hobbs, I'm -- I'm looking at the Safety Appliance Act. 
    It says that within six months from the passage of this Act, Interstate Commerce Commission so designate the number in both, dimensions location and manner of application of the appliances provided for by Section 2 of this Act. 
    And Section 2 is the sill steps and handbrakes, running board and so forth.

speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1569.565" stopTime="1577.568">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Now, what -- what about that -- that authority to the I.C.C. to designate?
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="1577.568" stopTime="1578.126">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Well, we don't think --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1578.126" stopTime="1584.349">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    (Voice Overlap) -- you convert the mentioned location and manner of application of the appliances provided by this Act.
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="1584.349" stopTime="1643.763">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    Well, we think that goes to the desire of Congress to have cited these appliances made uniform. 
    And the I.C.C. has -- we submit, has authority right now to -- to make a uniformity order with respect to this running board if it was to require on all cars, it can do so. 
    But we see no practical reason why they should free as the design of tank cars, some cars have it, some don't. 
    But if a car is designed that requires for its proper use of this type of running board, then it has to be secure whether the I.C.C. sees fit to standardize that appliance or not. 
    And the reason the I.C.C. gives for its failure to standardize is the reason that it inserts into Section 11 by share inference. 
    There is not a word in Section 11 to indicate that Congress didn't intend running boards on the top of cars to be maintained securely just as they intended that running boards on the bottom of a car be made.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1643.763" stopTime="1652.359">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    But it says they it shall designate the number. 
    As I understand it, they've -- they've designated the numbering.
speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="1652.359" stopTime="1708.023">
    Mr. Truman M. Hobbs 
    And when they designate the number, it -- the Act goes on to say, this shall remain as the standards of equipment to be used on all cars subject to the provisions of Section 11, which is your Section 2, subject to provision of Section 11. 
    And then, a little later on, in the same sentence, it says that failure to comply with regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be subject to a light penalty as failure to comply with any requirement of Section 11. 
    So, there were two evils. 
    One was the uniformity was to be implemented by the I.C.C.'s regulations that -- but the -- as this Court said the absolute, imperative statutory command of Section 11 could not be avoided by I.C.C. regulations.

   Argument of Norman C. Shepard
speaker="norman_c_shepard" startTime="1758.520" stopTime="1759.696">
    Mr. Norman C. Shepard 
    May it please the Court. 
    I think --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1759.696" stopTime="1760.988">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Shepard.
speaker="norman_c_shepard" startTime="1760.988" stopTime="1907.994">
    Mr. Norman C. Shepard 
    Thank you, sir. 
    The District Judge on the contrary told the jury that they need to make no finding as to that answer of the term in general verdict and need not to say which count is a basic point. 
    Now, may it please the Court. 
    This plaintiff of the course still has, under the Circuit Court decision, the right to go back and get a trial on the count of common law negligence. 
    As to the Safety Appliance Act, we say, in our brief two things. 
    We say it first that the Act does not require this board and we also say that the Safety Appliance Act is not available to this petitioner. 
    It appears in the brief and I have to call attention to it, the reply brief especially the statement is in there, inadvertently, I'm sure. 
    On page 12, that it is undisputed that its effective car was then used on respondent's line at the time of the injury. 
    We respectfully dispute that. 
    The entire record shows this car had been delivered on a private chauffeur to an industry and totally disconnected from the line of the railroad and was sitting there in their control and in their possession. 
    This man was an independent contractor. 
    He testified that he worked at filling stations on such things as gasoline pumps and he was available to these people. 
    Incidentally, the record will also show on page 122, the witness, Watkins, who was the helper of the plaintiff, testified that the petitioner first went upon the running board and made some adjustments and connections. 
    Then he came down to make the holes or fixed the holes at the bottom and return to the running board having to send his helper up because he was only showing his helper how this thing was done. 
    And it was not until both of them at their weight upon this dome step board that it broke. 
    It doesn't necessarily affect the legal problem confronting the Court but the petitioner passed over this board twice that are levered. 
    And of course, so does his helper and there was no apparent defect. 
    It is true that it broke. 
    Now, I might say to further to please --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1907.994" stopTime="1912.994">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is it true that the board was so rotten that it would crumble this (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Norman C. Shepard 
    Fragments of it, sir.

speaker="norman_c_shepard" startTime="1938.012" stopTime="2001.167">
    Mr. Norman C. Shepard 
    Well, if -- if it hadn't have the rotten place, I take it that the two of them might have been able to stand upon it. 
    Now, may it please the Court, this board or whatever name we call it isn't a running board because it doesn't run anywhere, it's a short board about six feet. 
    No one can run on it, nor does it run from any place to another. 
    Many of the old cars do not have a dome step board at all. 
    Some industry provide a scaffolding with a -- a flat form themselves into which these cars are -- are by -- are by the side of the truck where these cars are placed and their employees or their independent contractor use their own facilities. 
    There's no requirement whatever by the I.C.C. or the Act of Congress to make any convenience or device for those who unload the cars. 
    Loading and unloading devices are not covered anywhere in the Act. 
    Now, as to whether there has been a decision or not, this Act has been affected, I think, since 1910.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2001.167" stopTime="2014.829">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, is it true that the railroad company itself has, on many cases, many instances in connection with this case referred to this in the ordinary course of businesses or running boards?
speaker="norman_c_shepard" startTime="2014.829" stopTime="2040.263">
    Mr. Norman C. Shepard 
    Yes, sir. 
    It is in the record that some of the witnesses so testified, but I might call the Court's attention to the fact that acted easily have been by inadvertence, and then interrogatories, for instance, the profound -- the question might distinguish adversary use the expressions on 15 or 16 times and thereby getting the witness to use it for some seven times, I believe he said. 
    But in his reply brief, he --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2040.263" stopTime="2043.227">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you know the superintendents of the railroad?

    Yes. 
    I believe it was, yes, sir.

    But in his reply brief, he admits our contention about that and on page 2 he says, the witness is for the respondent and I have respondent's counsel. 
    Well, that's into referring to it as a running board which, of course, I'm very liable to do myself. 
    Now, if the Court pleases --
