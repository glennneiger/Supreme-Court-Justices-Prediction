    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    When the Court arose I was just coming to a brief discussion of the statutory provision in Section 307 (d), which directs the Commission whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest to establish through route and joint rates. 
    This provision which was passed in 1940 marked the culmination of a long struggle almost by Congress to obtain adequate joint rail-barge relationships. 
    The Federal Barge service began shortly after World War I, and then a series of statutes which we have traced in our brief, Congress again and again emphasized the importance of prescribing fair, through joint-barge routes and rates. 
    As a realistic matter, it's only in a small percentage of the cases that barge transportation is meaningful just by itself. 
    Most shippers and most receivers are not both located on a waterway and the result is that the barge transportation to be effective, it is necessary that there'll be a connection, either at the beginning or the end of the water journey or in fact, at both. 
    The inherent advantage of barge transportation as this Court recognized in Mechling is its cheapness. 
    Now, if you have -- again, reverting to the fact of this case, if you have a cheaper route in here, this course here is $5.32 for the barge plus a $1.5 to bring it to the -- from the mine to Galveston was $6.82 as against a local railway from the mine to here of possibly $8.73. 
    The saving of a $1.91, if you're just going from here to here, but if that is not passed on through a connecting rail carrier, the result is that the person who wants to get this sulphur here does not get the benefit. 
    Now, when Congress passed the statute in 1940, one of the things that it was concerned with and deeply concerned was the fare expressed by the proponents of water transportation. 
    That Congress -- that the Commission might administer this Act so as to favor the rail carriers over the water carriers, and it inserted as this Court pointed out in Mechling a number of provisions designed to do that. 
    The Mechling case was concerned with an attempt by the railroads to favor railroads over barge transportation through the device of raising the rates on the traffic which had been moved in by barge. 
    In the Mechling case, this Court struck down a Commission order which had approved a rate under which the railroads attempted to charge more for grain moving from Chicago to the east. 
    If it arrived in Chicago by barge, then it arrives in rail. 
    And in condemning that rate structure, this Court repeatedly pointed out that Congress permitted the Commission no way in which it could approve any rate system which failed to pass on to people who ship by barge the inherent advantage of barge transportation, namely, its lower cost and it relied primarily on the statement in the National Transportation policy that the Commission in administering the Act was to make sure that it would recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each form of transportation. 
    Now, Congress, when it passed the 1940 Act, also recognized there was another way in which the inherent advantage of barge transportation could be denied to shippers. 
    Instead of the railroads increasing the rail-barge rate, and therefore, wiping out the lower cost of barge transportation, the railroads could reduce their own rates to the level of the barge rates and that would have the same effect and we've set forth in our brief colloquy on the floor of the Senate in which that very question was raised. 
    It was pointed out, “Yes, that is prohibited by the Act.” 
    Now, in view of the fact that effective utilization of barge transportation requires that there'll be fair arrangements between the barges and the rail carriers to pass on to the shippers the inherent advantage of the barge transportation. 
    The failure of the railroads to establish through routes and joint rates with a connecting barge line, while at the same time, maintaining such a relationship with a connecting rail rate in a very serious sense denies to those who would ship by barge the inherent advantages of the barge transportation. 
    In the Mechling case, I'd like to quote briefly, “The Court pointed out at page 579 that it was not within the province of the Commission to adjust rates, elimination, to protect the traffic of railroads from barge competition.” 
    We think realistically in this case that is what has happened. 
    The only carrier that was before this Court and the only defendant railroad before the Commission were these railroads here, not any of these railroads going from East St.Louis to the mine. 
    These railroads up here, the ones who were receiving the barge track have refused to establish the joint rates for the rail carriers on the ostensible ground that if they don't want to get less than $2.95 from a barge traffic moving along here. 
    Well, the first and obvious answer to that is they're not getting anything on the barge traffic now because no barge traffic is moving. 
    The Commission found that since 1950, all of the traffic from the Galveston Mines to Danville has moved by rail, and of course, that isn't at all surprising because I seriously doubt that any sane businessmen would want to pay 60 cents more for inferior transportation. 
    The Commission now suggests in its brief that there was another ground upon which this description of through joint rates is not required. 
    It says at page 50, “The Commission was not required to support the railroad to give up their long haul of a thousand mile and merely taking an exchange this short 186-mile for -- from East St.Louis to Danville.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Who -- who says that, the Commission?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="431.685" stopTime="625.823">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The Commission says that in its brief now. 
    And our answer to that is, that the only question here is whether this railroad, the railroads from East St.Louis to Danville are required to treat the barges at least the same way as they treat the connecting railroad. 
    And the fact that they apparently wish to protect these railroads from barge competition is not a proper ventures upon which the Commission refuses to prescribe the through joint rates. 
    The Commission also suggests in its brief that the barge route is circuitous, much longer than the railroad. 
    Therefore, they say now, “It was not required -- that the Commission is not required to find a description of rail barge rates within the through rates within the public interest. 
    The short answer to that we think is two-fold. 
    First, the Commission did not rely on that, they didn't. 
    The second and more important, the lower barge cost, the total of $9.77 as against the old rail combination rate of $11.66 was achieved despite the fact that the barge traffic is more -- a more cumbersome route. 
    And of course, one of the things about the barge is it's slower. 
    The barges themselves move slower and the river twists and turns, it doesn't go straight the way a railroad track does. 
    But the fact is that the barges are able to operate this route at $5.32. 
    They should be permitted to pass on to shippers the same benefits that the connecting rail -- the railroad got here give to their connecting rail carriers. 
    We thus think that under the facts of this case where you have a situation that absent joint all-rail rates, the rail barge cost to the shipper would be substantially cheaper than the all-rail rate and whereas the result of a joint all-rail rate, the barge service which is inherently cheaper now costs 60 cents more than the past rail service that the Commission was inquired upon that it was necessary or desirable in the public interest in order to preserve the inherent advantages of the barge transportation to establish through barge routes and joints rates. 
    We also think that the same result follows under Section 3 (4), which prohibits a discrimination by carriers between connecting lines including water carriers. 
    And we think that there's a discrimination prohibited by this section on a rail carrier, establishes a through route and joint rate with one of the connecting rail carriers and at the same time refuses to establish such a through route and joint rate with a connecting barge line which in turn competes with the connecting rail carrier.

    Mr. Friedman, must the joint rate necessarily be lower than the constituent local?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Not necessarily, Mr. Justice, but I can see of no reason why they would otherwise establish a joint rate. 
    And I think traditionally in the railroad field, joint rates are created to have --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="650.708" stopTime="788.432">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The -- Section 3 (4) is basically designed, we think, to prohibit a carrier from favoring one of two connecting carriers. 
    Now, the Commission repeatedly has held that if a rail carrier has two connecting water carriers, it's a discrimination prohibited by 3 (4) for it to establish through routes and joint rates with one of the water carriers and not with one of the others. 
    Similarly, it is held that where there are two connecting rail carriers, it's discriminatory to establish through routes and joint rates with one and not to establish it with the other. 
    We don't think it makes any difference here that one of the connecting carriers involved is a water carrier and the other one is a rail carrier. 
    The statute speaks in terms of connecting carriers, it doesn't say discriminate between connecting carriers of the same type or prohibit discrimination between all connecting carriers, and we think that whether there are two connecting carriers, which are competing with each other for the business of the shipper, the railroad is required to treat them alike. 
    Of course, that's all that the barges are seeking here. 
    All they're seeking is an opportunity to compete with the rails for the shippers' business on the same term. 
    They proposed, if they will give these railroads joining East St.Louis to Danville the same amount as they receive from the rail carriers. 
    It is supposed that it is probably $2.26 because that is what they receive from Port Sulphur and we think it's quite significant that when there are two sources of sulphur, the rail carriers are willing to make an arrangement with this group and unwilling to make an arrangement with this group. 
    Now, the way we reach the conclusion under 307 (d) that the Commission was required to establish these rates in order to cure the discrimination under Section 3 (4) is that since it was a discrimination under 3 (4) and is illegal under 3 (4), it is plainly necessary or desirable in the public interest for the Commission to prescribe through routes and joint rates to cure that discrimination. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Samuel R. Howell
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="788.432" stopTime="788.836">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Howell.
speaker="samuel_r_howell" startTime="788.836" stopTime="963.164">
    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to state at the outset that the statement to which counsel has just referred in the Commission's brief from page 18 which had indicate that the Commission is basing its decision on the short holding provision of the Section 15 (4) is an inadvertence and the Commission does not rely upon the short holding or circuitous routing of this traffic at all in reaching its decision in this case. 
    As a matter of fact, when the barge lines filed a petition with the Commission for reconsideration of Division 3's action which found that there was no discrimination under Section 3 (4), and therefore, and that there have been no showing of any evidence that the barge lines -- that there should be through routes and joint rates established between the barge lines and the railroads in the public interest. 
    And so, the barge lines in asking the Commission -- for Commission to reconsider the action of Division 5, asked that the only -- ask that only with respect to Section 3 (4). 
    And the entire Commission only considered the petition for reconsideration under Section 3 (4). 
    And on the -- when this case was brought into the District Court by the barge lines, the barge lines only asked for a review of the Commission's order under Section 3 (4) and nothing else and the -- and the case was considered by the District Court under 3 (4). 
    And on -- in the jurisdictional statement of the barge lines here, the only alleged discrimination is under Section 3 (4). 
    The Department of Justice's brief, the Department of -- rather, the United State -- brief of the United States discusses the Section 307 (d) issue and that is not even involved in the case. 
    It was not raised in the jurisdictional statement and the United States haven't filed no jurisdictional statement, but merely filed a motion, it's the first time it has got in the case at all, were filing a motion or rather a brief in opposition to the Commission's motion to affirm. 
    Therefore, the -- it would not be having the standing to raise the question of the Section 307 (d) matter. 
    But that -- that's beside the point. 
    The main thing that I wanted to get to talk about now is the question of division, which counsel for the barge lines discussed in his argument. 
    And he made one -- counsel made one statement that deserves some attention. 
    He said, “That services from East St.Louis to Danville, over the rail route was identical on X barge as an X rail track.” 
    Now, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record that would support that statement.

    I'll answer, Your Honor in this way, that these barge lines charged a violation -- discrimination in violation of Section 3 (4). 
    They did not present any evidence that would sustain a violation of Section 3 (4) and the Commission so found. 
    If they -- before they could establish a discrimination under Section 3 (4), it would be incumbent upon them and the burden rested upon them to show that there was a difference in the transportation conditions, and they didn't do it at East St.Louis.

    If Your Honor please, I -- I don't know what the rule of the Commission is with respect to that, except as -- as I found in that, in the case which I mentioned and that is the cases now in court and is subject to judicial review and another proceeding in a -- in one of the lower courts. 
    Now, I -- I'm -- I understand that it is the position of the Commission that though -- that the private agreements between railroads is not a matter that has any effect or influence upon the -- the manner of making rates. 
    And therefore, it is not relevant to the issue and that they do not require the -- they consider that evidence as being immaterial. 
    Now, in regard to the appellant's contention that the appellee railroads violates Section 3 (4) by accepting a division of an -- of an all-rail joint rate which is less than the rate at which they carry to Danville, sulphur that has been brought to -- by barge East St.Louis. 
    We submit that under the -- under that theory that a division of the joint rate, all-rail rate would be the same thing as a rate or charge which may be compared with and treated the same as a published rate or charge paid by a shipper. 
    And a division of a rate is not a rate. 
    It is not a charge with which the shipper would be concerned, because the shipper is only concerned with the -- with the amount that it takes, the amount he has to pay to transport his property from one point to another point. 
    He doesn't care whether the -- the -- A railroad gets a certain amount of -- in the form of division from B railroad, and that is no -- no concern to him unless it would have some effect upon the -- the total amount he had to pay. 
    And that -- and the divisions do not influence or have any effect upon the amount that the shipper pays. 
    Now, on an unpublished division of a joint rate is not a rate or charge within the meaning of Section 3 (4) of the Act. 
    The Section 3 (4) insofar as it's applicable to this case, merely prohibits the carrier subject to part one of the Act, and also, now by the Transportation Act of 1940 of the -- the barge, the water carriers. 
    It prohibits carriers from discriminating in their rates, fares and charges. 
    Now, there's no other word said about divisions in -- in Section 3 (4). 
    And the -- and the division, the Commission has held in -- in numerous cases is not a rate. 
    And it held it in -- in this case. 
    Now, this Court stated that in the -- in St.Louis Southwestern Railway Company versus United States in 245 U.S., opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, that a division of a joint rate is the share which each railroad receives and there's a result of private contract between carriers. 
    And the Court said that in that case, that divisions are and I quote, "A matter of bargain and maybe fixed at in an -- in an arbitrary amount, and sometimes one carrier is allowed the full local rate while the rate of another is seriously reduced, and that the basis of such divisions differ greatly in practice." 
    Now, divisions, therefore, between carriers, reflect bargaining and -- and strategic position of carriers participating in joint rates. 
    They reflect competitive factors. 
    Now, the situation that is clearly demonstrated by the situation at the Port Sulphur, Louisiana to which counsel has -- counsel had referred. 
    There, the -- the barge lines have through routes and joint rates with the rail lines for the delivery of sulphur from Port Sulphur to Danville -- to Danville, Illinois. 
    The barge line factor for the transportation from New Orleans or Port Sulphur to East St.Louis is $4.20. 
    The -- the rail carriers, the total through rate I believe is $6.66 on which the barge factor is only $4.20. 
    And the railroads accept as a division in lieu of the $2.95 rate, $2.26, a 100 pounds for each share of the transportation. 
    Now, with respect to that sulphur, the -- the sulphur originates with the barge lines. 
    It's brought in by some private, little tramcars or something owned by the producers and it moved a few hundred yards or whatever the distance is, up to the barges and they load it in to the barge. 
    So, the price of sulphur or rather the -- the sulphur at Port Sulphur has no prior rail haul. 
    The railroads have their hands upon it. 
    And they get to East St.Louis. 
    Now, the -- then, they are able. 
    They're in a strategic position in order to get a little -- to get a better share of the division, and there is nothing to send us through, as I understand it about carriers --

    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    Because they have the sulphur, they originated the sulphur themselves and they have it and they -- and of course, under Section 15 (6), if Your Honor please, the -- which gives the Commission now jurisdiction over divisions of rates. 
    It -- it -- they stated in that -- in that Section, Section 15 (6), the standards by which the Commission must -- will be governed in determining division of rates. 
    And one of those standards or factors is, whether or not the carrier involved with the division, would be an originating carrier or whether he's an intermediate or a delivering carrier. 
    Of course, the other factor is involved. 
    There's a cost of service and all of -- and -- and several other factors, but those factors are even different from the factors going into the matter of determining what is a reasonable rate.

    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    If Your Honor please, the reason the Commission did not find that the -- find discrimination and it may well have ordered a through routes and joint rates if it had found discrimination was because there was no evidence in the record to -- to prove that there was a need, first in the public interests for these through routes. 
    And secondly, there was no evidence to show that there was any need for any differential rates, lower than the all -- lower than the joint through all-rail rate.

    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    No, the -- the answer to that would be that the all -- that the $2.95 local rates of the Danville, East St. Louis-Danville carrier is shown to be on a depressed basis. 
    Now, that is shown in the record that the -- at -- by -- and the Commission points out, makes a finding on it. 
    That the -- that the general basis for the reasonableness of some rates in the Southwestern or Southeastern Texas area was 13.5% of first class. 
    Now, that -- that rate was found reasonable by a Commission in an appropriate proceeding, Marion Manufacturing Company versus The Akron Railroad.

    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    And onto -- I'm coming to the local rate, if the Court please, and it found in this case that if the -- if the reasonable -- if rates that are 13.5% of first class on sulphur is reasonable in the Southeastern Texas, then the two $2.95 rate, which is 9.2% of first class would show that the $2.95 rate was a depressed rate, and it makes comparisons between the -- the rates on comparable distances within the area around the East St. Louis and Danville. 
    And it shows that the rates from -- well, a comparable distance might be as much as twice, I mean, be twice as much as the $2.95 rate. 
    And in every rate they used, they showed that the -- that the rate for comparable distance was more than the $2.95. 
    So, the Commission found that the $2.95 rate was depressed.

    But --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2177.625" stopTime="2221.071">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    --about depressed if I understand you, the argument -- is this the argument that if there were no barge traffic competition, and not only the local from East St. Louis to Danville, but the joint rates from Galveston to Danville would be higher than it is with (Inaudible) because then the railroad could charge more without pure competition. 
    In order to meet the competition of a water traffic, the joint rates as well as the local, could find a local, say, has been reduced in order not to be outdone in order to have any traffic, that's against the barge. 
    Is that the answer to that rate, description of what you've meant by this rate?
speaker="samuel_r_howell" startTime="2221.071" stopTime="2226.036">
    Mr. Samuel R. Howell

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2226.036" stopTime="2262.419">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suggest it is -- my suggestion is, that if you -- if the railroad, the Danville Road was compelled to have a joint rate with the barge. 
    The fact would still -- would still be further lower to give that -- that is still further (Inaudible) advantage of the barge rate and still further cut in the competitive function or the competitive trust of barge as against rail traffic, is that right?
speaker="samuel_r_howell" startTime="2262.419" stopTime="2329.424">
    Mr. Samuel R. Howell 
    Yes, Your Honor, that -- that's right. 
    Now, the -- I'd like to say this that the Commission found that the barge, that the fully distributed cost of the barge lines for transporting the sulphur from Galveston to East St.Louis amounted to $4.03 a ton. 
    And that the -- the barge rate -- oh, and added to that would be of course the -- I think 29 cents is shown in the -- the record, 29 cents across to the barge lines for transferring the sulphur from the rail -- from barge to rail which will make a total of $4.23 -- $4.32, a fully distributed cost of the barge lines for transporting the sulphur. 
    Now, they charge a rate of $5.32. 
    That's the barge factor, so that would give the rail -- would give the barge lines a total profit on a ton of sulphur moved from Galveston to the East St. Louis of $1.

    That's right. 
    That may have occurred across the period of years. 
    That rate of $9.18, joint all-rail, I should like to dispel any notion that that was simply put in to attract the Danville trip. 
    That is a rate which represents 41 cents per 100 pounds, which has been in effect for many years and which extends, not only to Danville, but to many, many parts on the Great Lakes. 
    We've had several cases before the Commission on the 41-cent basis and they have just recently, within the last six months, finally approved that rate.

    Sir, it would take a -- a rate man to tell you that with a tariff at his side.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3017.439" stopTime="3020.915">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Now, there is no depressed rate between East St. Louis and Danville, is it?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3020.915" stopTime="3047.535">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    Yes, sir. 
    That brings me to a point. 
    Mr. Belnap was very careful to point out to you that Danville is an inland point that there is no water competition there, and therefore, that rate of $2.95 could not be depressed. 
    But the $2.95 applies to Joliet, which is approximately up here on the Illinois Waterway, and that is a competitive point. 
    And on the lines of these railroads operating between --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3047.535" stopTime="3050.269">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That mean -- that means Joliet has the same rate?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3050.269" stopTime="3051.852">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    That's right, because Danville would be intermediate.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3051.852" stopTime="3054.696">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Danville is farther south than Joliet?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3054.696" stopTime="3055.418">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    Yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3055.418" stopTime="3057.341">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Not as long haul.
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3057.341" stopTime="3271.693">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    No. 
    Danville would simply take the same rate because it's intermediate on the lines of these carriers operating between the St.Louis and Joliet. 
    Now, while Mister -- may I continue, Mr. Justice? 
    While Mr. Howell has discussed the overall aspects of the case on behalf of the Commission, I should like to make my argument a bit more personal on behalf of the railroads. 
    In December of 1949, these barge lines approached the railroads with one proposal, a through route, a joint rate of $7.67, a division to them of $5.41, and the balance of $2.26 to us. 
    Now, please note that their local rate at that time was $5.32, so their great contribution to this competitive effort is to take 9 cents more as their requested division of the joint rate. 
    So that any advantage, which is going to accrue to a shipper or consignee is going to accrue from the railroads, not from any action of the barge lines. 
    We turned that proposal down. 
    It was not recommended. 
    And we would not recommend their proposal from any barge line or any railroad on that basis, because, as I think one of the justices pointed out, joint rates are ordinary less than the combination of locals. 
    So, it means that your division would ordinarily be less all things considered equal. 
    But what the appellants expect you to do here is to write divisions into Section 3 (4). 
    They wish to make a comparison between a division, which is dealt elsewhere within the Act and a rate or a charge which the Congress deals with under Section 3 (4). 
    They admit that those two things are not comparable when a shipper comes before the Commission or before the Court, but they overlooked the point that the reason they're not comparable is because they are unlike things in their very establishment under the law that Congress has dealt differently with both of them in the Act. 
    They are inherently different, and thus, it is the comparison itself which is invalid. 
    And if the comparison is invalid, it is not -- it does not depend on who makes it. 
    A division is specifically dealt with in Section 15 (6). 
    At other points throughout the Act, the Congress has taken care to -- to say divisions when they mean divisions. 
    And you will find differences reflected throughout the Act such as in Section 1 (4) where the railroads are required to maintain just and reasonable rates, but just reasonable, and equitable divisions. 
    And nowhere in the Act will you find the term “equitable” used in connection with the rate, a fare, or a charge.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3271.693" stopTime="3304.072">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, Mr. Daily, if -- if the demand of the barge lines for a joint rail rate were exceeded here, then what you suggest, these are the barges that would have an equally larger share by way of division? 
    It would not have to be heeded because the Commission can then fix upon a complaint, whatever may be the private rate, the Commission can fix the appropriate division as standard.

    Mr. John A. Daily 
    That's perfectly right. 
    And it demonstrates, I think, what I said in the beginning, what they asked for when they started out a division for themselves of $5.41, 9 cents more than the local. 
    And they have to have that entire package, not just any part of it. 
    They have to have it all and they're asking this Court to give it to them --

    Do you mean, from their selfish point of view, from their business point of view?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3366.430" stopTime="3367.912">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    That's the only view I see of theirs here, Mr. Justice.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3367.912" stopTime="3375.661">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well -- well, these people of the old at that time, don't know what are self-business is.
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3375.661" stopTime="3594.686">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    I think that I can demonstrate this. 
    At the time of this proposal, as were shown by a movement study in the past six months of 1950, the last six months of the 1950, the record shows that the contract carrier, barge, was moving this traffic at a rate of $4.65 per gross ton, 67 cents a ton under the local rate maintained by these plaintiffs. 
    It was not moving all-rail. 
    They could not conceivably, honestly, and justly blame the all-rail railroad rate for their failure to share in the tonnage, because the barge carrier contract rate of $4.65 obviously provided a much more economic method of transportation to the shipper. 
    Now, when they see that that barge, that contract carrier barge is moving this at $4.65, they have two choices. 
    The first is obvious, reduce our rate and make ourselves competitive on the barge leg of the haul. 
    The second is a little more obscure and it takes a little ingenuity. 
    If we can sell the railroads, the idea of a joint rate, through route, and get at least as much as we now get for our local rate, then we can get the sulphur to the Danville consignee at the same amount with very little difference, if any, as that Danville consignee can now get it by contract carrier barge. 
    And so, they come to the Commission in the guise of public interest and necessity, seeking through routes and joint rates, if you please, contending that the railroads are keeping them out of this traffic, and all they're going to do is get the sulphur to the Danville consignee at the same cost. 
    The only difference is that if they can get that joint rate in the public interest, that joint rate will be available only to them. 
    And the contract carrier with whom we do not and are not required to join the joint rates, will still have the application of the $2.95 local rate, plus his $4.65. 
    So, they get themselves into the position where they can compete, but at the same time for that barge leg of the haul, these very generous people who tell you they only want equality of treatment, are not going to give any of that decreased cost to the shipper or to the consignee. 
    They're giving him nothing he doesn't have at the time, and that's why no shipper or consignee appear if they were giving them some advantage. 
    In my very brief experience with the railroads and before the Commission, I have never noticed the reluctance on the part of any shipper to appear and tell the railroads he wanted something, but he wasn't getting any advantage here. 
    And then, I think --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3594.686" stopTime="3607.594">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why shouldn't -- why shouldn't the railroad -- Danville railroads be willing to -- to give the barge line the same -- the same rate as it gives the other railroad carriers?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3607.594" stopTime="3659.709">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    Now, at the time, if I may answer it this way. 
    At that time, it's moving by contract carrier barge, and our revenue on the traffic, which is moving barge rail is $2.95. 
    That's where the preponderance of the sulphur is moving. 
    Now, they come along with their proposal. 
    They want us to reduce that revenue and they suggest $2.26. 
    So, we will take the -- we will take the difference of 69 cents per gross ton, we lose that. 
    The shipper gains nothing he doesn't already have. 
    And the only beneficiary of the whole deal is the plaintiff barge lines, who come to us, if you please, and want more than their local rate as their division of a joint rate.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3659.709" stopTime="3676.948">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, how will you gain any benefit from -- from the higher rate that you charge the -- the barge people if there isn't going to be any barge traffic and you have to -- you have to get all of the sulphur there by rail at your $2.26 rate?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3676.948" stopTime="3687.390">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    Mr. Justice, that simply wasn't the fact. 
    The fact is we did have the revenue. 
    We did have the revenue at that time, $2.95 a gross ton.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3687.390" stopTime="3703.009">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, you haven't got it. 
    You won't have it now when you entered this ruling of the -- of the Commission. 
    There's nobody who's going to -- nobody is going to ship anything by barge, are they, if it costs 70 cents a ton more to get it from -- from the mines to Danville.

    Mr. John A. Daily 
    No, sir. 
    That's what I tried to point out at the beginning that a barge contract carrier will carry that sulphur at $4.65 a gross ton and that apparently gave the shipper or consignee enough economy that that's the way he wanted it to move.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3952.437" stopTime="3964.460">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So, really, what -- what they have to do -- or is it correct to say that what we have to do is to decide whether 3 (4) applies to the through and joint rates of theirs?
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="3964.460" stopTime="4131.845">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    I think that's their point, yes, sir. 
    Yes, that's the point that I think is properly before the Court. 
    And if I can leave the subject of a division -- oh, before I leave that subject, I would simply like to point out one factor. 
    Mr. Belnap left you with the idea, or at least, he left me with the idea that he was leaving you with the idea that a through route and a joint rate is their only answer to this question of divisions. 
    That -- that the Commission cannot deal with these divisions and so forth and that they are left without relief in the absence of through routes and joint rates. 
    Nothing could be more further from the fact. 
    At the time of the oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs was asked, “Suppose that we,” meaning, the Commission, “were to establish proportional rates between East St.Louis and Danville, the same as the amount of the rail division, would that solve your difficulty?” 
    Now, that's they're complaint here. 
    That's the particular point of the appellants. 
    And the answer was, “Yes, sir, that's one way of taking care of the discrimination, but that isn't the one we want.” 
    And that's in the record at pages 146 and 147. 
    They're satisfied with nothing less than a through route and joint rate, and they didn't give the Commission a scintilla of evidence of the public interest and necessity that is required under Section 15 (3) and 307 (d), and the same statement holds true for what is or is not a reasonable differential under Section 307 (d). 
    If the -- why didn't they want that? 
    Now, let's assume that that had been ordered. 
    And now, we charge the same for both types of transportation. 
    Now, how can they complain against us? 
    They can't. 
    But how does that fit their situation? 
    Now, that rate that the Commission has established means we've got to charge the same for everybody, regardless of a division or anything else. 
    The trouble is that rate would then be available on any sulphur which came in the East St.Louis by a railroad with whom we do not joined in a joint rate, on any sulphur which came into St.Louis by truck, on any sulphur which came in by the plaintiff barge lines, and on any sulphur which came in by the contract carrier barge line. 
    So, when they got all through and we were purged of our so-called discrimination, they would turn around to be confronted with the same competition they were confronted with before, a lower contract rate on the river.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4131.845" stopTime="4139.535">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They're also confronted with the lower or the higher -- being compelled to pay a higher rate to the railroad rate, I think.
speaker="john_a_daily" startTime="4139.535" stopTime="4194.954">
    Mr. John A. Daily 
    Sir, that -- that brings me to the point of divisions versus rates, fares, and charges. 
    That Congress deals with those specifically. 
    You cannot compare those simply saying that this amount is a division and this amount is a local rate, and the two are different and therefore, some discrimination must exist, because different factors go into account in divisions. 
    Divisions do not depend on the cost of service alone. 
    Section 15 (6) sets out the various items which the Court -- which the Commission has been directed by the Congress to specifically consider, and that's why, and the appellants admit that divisions may and do vary between the same carriers for the same service on the same commodity between the same points. 
    And the fact that the divisions do so differ from each other establishes nothing.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4194.954" stopTime="4195.195">

    It does --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What it established here, because I may be wrong, that the same sulphur come from the same place, precisely the same time it gets to East St.Louis, and your railroad takes it to Danville, you charge more for it if it came by railroad or if it came by barge than when it came by railroad.

    That would cure the discrimination. 
    They admit that, but that isn't what they want.

    Mr. John A. Daily 
    They would simply decrease it as it applies to these people. 
    That's right.One more thing, there has been some testimony of pro and con about the absence or a non-absence of a showing of what service changes are here or differences. 
    There is no showing at all in this record, whether the services are the same or different, but let me point out just one thing to you as a matter of common sense. 
    When we receive all-rail traffic from our southwestern connections at East St.Louis, that sulphur is in cars, which is supplied by the Southwestern lines. 
    In maintaining our local rate between East St.Louis and Danville, it is we who must round up and supply all these empty cars. 
    In other words, on through all-rail traffic, our only duty would be to put a locomotive on the end of their train and take it away. 
    But here, just as a matter of common sense, we have to supply the cars from the traffic. 
    We have to round up these empties, put them down at the dock, how many of them we don't know because this comes up in 1,000-ton lots, but that's a considerable number of empties to supply. 
    So, there is at least that difference in the service. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Nuel D. Belnap

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Belnap, you have a few minutes.

    Mr. Nuel D. Belnap 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please, just on the last point as to supply of cars, these lines, of course, do not serve the barge terminals. 
    There's a switching line service for barge terminals. 
    The record is that federal barge lines and American barge lines, which are the terminating barge lines of East St.Louis, for cars supplied, pay per diem, the usual per diem rate for the cars throughout the terminal and pay a per diem reclaim the switching line.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you explain your viewpoint of what was said about the contract carrier --

    Mr. Nuel D. Belnap 
    Yes, sir.

    -- and your -- and the contract barges in your argument?
speaker="nuel_d_belnap" startTime="4478.975" stopTime="4528.401">
    Mr. Nuel D. Belnap 
    During the course of the oral argument in 1953, November, Mr. Daily argued the case for the railroads. 
    He talked about and I quote, “The traffic which we now have with the Missouri Pacific.” 
    That's on the record 139. 
    He spoke about a prior movement from Galveston by a contract carrier. 
    The evidence shows that in the latter part of 1950, there was such a movement by a contract carrier. 
    In the report of the Commission, upon reconsideration on page 30 of the record, decided in January 1954, this is said, “Beginning with and since 1951, the entire movement of sulphur from the Galveston area approximating 20,000 tons a year has been over at the all-rail routes.”
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4528.401" stopTime="4531.875">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there anything to dispute that anywhere else in the record?

    Mr. Nuel D. Belnap 
    No, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4533.187" stopTime="4539.224">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So, that the result of all -- for some -- for some reason, all the sulphur now goes over the railroad.
speaker="nuel_d_belnap" startTime="4539.224" stopTime="4547.369">
    Mr. Nuel D. Belnap 
    It all goes over the railroad. 
    I think in the examiner's proposed report, there was a statement that the contract carrier had gone out of business. 
    And in that --
