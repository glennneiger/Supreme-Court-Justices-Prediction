Armstrong v. Armstrong
speaker="walter_k_sibbald" startTime="0.000" stopTime="130.484">
    Mr. Walter K. Sibbald 
    And the moment of starting for the recess, I was referring to Mr. Ward's in connection with the filing of this master's report. 
    On page 11 of the respondent's brief, I have quoted from his testimony when he appeared as a witness in this case and I asked him if he had anything to do with the preparation of the master's report in Florida. 
    And he answered, “Oh, definitely, yes, sure.” 
    Then I asked him whether he took any part in the preparation of that report and his answer was, “I do not recall whether I did or not”. 
    Then, I called his attention to a sentence at the end of that report, a special master's fee in this cause is settled by an agreement between counsel for plaintiff and your master. 
    And when I asked him when he had that agreement after being evasive for at least one answer, he finally said, “I imagined it was about the time he was ready to file the report.” 
    And when I asked him how much he paid the master under this private agreement, he said, “It was either $200 or $250.” 
    And the record shows that customarily in Florida, master commissioner in uncontested divorce action are paid under the order of the Court, a fee of $25. 
    Now, I say that it is a matter of serious concern where we are in considering the full faith and credit or due process of law that are involved in this Florida decree, whether a report filed by the master upon which the Court makes its order under those circumstances is due process of law.

    You happen to know what the facts of the trial with regard to (Inaudible)
speaker="walter_k_sibbald" startTime="138.672" stopTime="267.231">
    Mr. Walter K. Sibbald 
    In Florida, I copied the statute, where there's no -- no arrangement made for this. 
    It shall be fixed by an order of the Court. 
    That's the statute that I copied into my brief. 
    So, I -- I say to Your Honors that I -- I still -- still seriously appeal that this entire decree, this entire proceeding in Florida was not entitled to full faith and credit. 
    But whether that be true or not, it wasn't in this case until after the question as to whether it was, was not in this case in the trial court and was not considered either as a matter of the pleadings or in the trial of the case. 
    Now, counsel for Mr. Armstrong here in his replied brief says that, when I quote the brief filed on behalf of Mr. Armstrong and the trial court wherein they admit it that they were just two questions in this case. 
    First, whether the Court could grant a divorce and secondly, whether it could make a division of property, where they agreed with me that those were the two cases. 
    Mr. -- or Judge Gorman in his brief says, “Oh, I just took a sentence out of context.” 
    Now, in order that there'll be -- be no question about that as to whether that was the matter -- the means upon which this case was tried in the lower court. 
    I have had printed and have left with the clerk the required number of copies of the brief filed on behalf of Armstrong in the trial court wherein it was agreed by all concerned that there were two questions before the Court. 
    First, whether the Court could grant a divorce. 
    Secondly, whether the Court could make a division of property. 
    And I'm asking (Inaudible) now to have that copy of the brief filed here as a supplement to my brief rather than have it appear in this record that I haven't stated it by just pulling a sentence out of context.

    The -- the petitioner here started out in this case depending as I have said upon Thompson versus Thompson, you will not be apparently today and in his reply brief, it's shifted away from that and says that he claims now that there -- there was due process of law. 
    But if Thompson versus Thompson were the basis of his claim, then I -- I suggest to the Court that there isn't anything that this Court has said in either of the two Williams cases or in any of the other cases that have come up here involving the subject of divisible divorce or ex parte divorce that would warrant this Court in holding that a decree such as was entered in Thompson versus Thompson by the Virginia court is entitled to full faith and credit because of the reasons that you have given full faith and credit to the ex parte divorce decrees that have been before this Court. 
    You said that as a matter of practicality, making due process of law and full faith and credit coincide as it where in order to protect innocent persons and legitimacy of children that divorce decrees must be given faith and credit. 
    Thompson versus Thompson involved no such decree. 
    It did not dissolve the marital relationship and therefore, it would not be entitled the full faith and credit for the reasons that you have given in these other cases. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Robert N. Gorman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="409.942" stopTime="415.314">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gorman.
speaker="robert_n_gorman" startTime="415.314" stopTime="708.166">
    Mr. Robert N. Gorman 
    There have been many questions it seems to me that -- or aside from the issues. 
    Now, I want to say right at the outset and I have the greatest respect for my former colleague, Judge Zimmerman, who wrote the opinion in the Supreme Court Ohio. 
    But very frankly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals is a much more exhaustive opinion and it shows that practically every one of these questions that was here were determined by the Court of Appeals. 
    They were not any last minutes suggestions and the opinion of the Court of Appeals is on 11 (a) to 24 (a) of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
    For example, on 17 (a), it shows that Mr. Sibbald did raise the question that the divorce was fraudulent and the Court of Appeals there found there was no fraud and therefore, we don't have to pay any attention to that stuff about master commissioner's fees. 
    And the Court of Appeals says, it should be noted that the trial court made no express finding that the Florida decree had been obtained through fraud and deceit. 
    And then there is another proposition in the opinion on 14 (a), it went into length about hitting people and knocking their teeth out, all of those matters were disputed, that letter was very greatly disputed because most of it was in her own handwriting and Armstrong said he didn't know what he was signing. 
    He knew what he wrote out but what she wrote out, he didn't know. 
    But all we have to do is to look at 14 (a) of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
    There it says in the last paragraph, at the trial of these issues evidence was introduced from which the conclusion could be reasonably deduced that the plaintiff in this action, that's Mrs.Armstrong, had been guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty and that the Florida decree granting a divorce to defendant herein was supported by sufficient evidence. 
    Well, if that is true what our claim is and if those were the facts, Ohio could not act as a court of review on that Florida decree because if those facts are true, they have once adjudicated and they had said, as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, they had denied alimony, which is on page 249 of the record. 
    Now, I want to say before coming to one of the most important points that this issue has been in the case from the very outset. 
    All you have to do is to look at page 2 and 3 of Mr. Sibbald's brief, where he brings up the question that the Florida decree was obtained by fraud, then you go to page 7 of the record whereas defendant denies that plaintiff was not served with summons and set action pending in the Dade County Circuit Court. 
    It said defendant have been duly and legally served with summons and set action. 
    According to the law of State of Florida and that by reason thereof said court had full and complete jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over the persons of this defendant. 
    I don't know how more clearly you can raise an issue of res judicata than that. 
    But if there was any doubt if you will turn to page 11, which Mr. Sibbald did not read, for further answer, defendant denies each and every allegation in plaintiff's amended petition contained, not herein specifically admitted to be true. 
    And further says that by reason, the allegations aforesaid, plaintiffs is -- plaintiff is not entitled to a divorce or alimony from defendant. 
    Within there very clearly, so the issue has been here all the time, both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals recognized it. 
    And I might say, by the way, that there is no question raised either by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court that this was a division of property. 
    There are two things that are clear in both opinions. 
    One is that the matrimonial domicile, they say, was in fraud and there's no evidence to the conflict. 
    And secondly, they recognized the Florida decree as one, not going into a division to property but denying alimony. 
    If you will turn to 25 (a), here is what the Supreme Court says in the syllabus --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="708.166" stopTime="710.185">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That's the petition?
speaker="robert_n_gorman" startTime="710.185" stopTime="785.369">
    Mr. Robert N. Gorman 
    In the petition for writ. 
    And I think we've had an argument before here over what the syllabus in Ohio means in a former case. 
    Paragraph 2 of the syllabus, 25 (a), such a divorce decrees in favor husband based on service by publication on the wife residing in another State does not as to a denial of alimony therein operate extraterritorially and he's not entitled to full faith and credit section in the opinion. 
    If we go over to page 28, but may a divorce secured by a husband even in the so-called matrimonial domicile were service of summons on the wife then residing another State has been by publication only denied a wife any right to alimony not division of property, so that such denial must be recognized this conclusive in another jurisdiction. 
    They say we think not. 
    But on those two points, matrimonial domicile and on the question of this being whether it's alimony or whether it's a division of property, there was no dispute whatsoever in the lower courts and if we take the decree on page 248 of the record --

    Mr. Robert N. Gorman 
    There are others -- her suit involved a partition of real estate and that has all been determined. 
    That was referred to a master commissioner and that's been decided and the money has all been divided up. 
    But I think there's no question to see about the decree because it's dated October 1st, 1951. 
    And this petition is not filed until 1952 and they are referring there to Armstrong separate action to recover the physical certificates. 
    And that's what he had to do in a separate action because there was no way he could get them down in another State. 
    Now, I think we always comeback as I say, you can talk about Pawley versus Pawley. 
    Pawley versus Pawley as if -- my opinion, a very poorly written opinion, but it does not have the Full Faith and Credit Clause at all. 
    It's one on comity. 
    It's a matter of a divorce in Cuba. 
    And the real question, if you read all the opinions was not a matter of full faith and credit. 
    It was rather Pawley an American citizen, could go over to Cuba and get a divorce. 
    That was really what was at stake there.

    They were there long enough to get a divorce in Nevada. 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="robert_n_gorman" startTime="1179.217" stopTime="1420.724">
    Mr. Robert N. Gorman 
    Oh, Nevada, that makes all a difference in the world. 
    I have never made a claim if Armstrong went out to Nevada and got this decree in this way in service by publication. 
    There would be a good decree. 
    My claim is this, that Florida was the State -- the State of the dominant interest that if they couldn't settle their problems in Florida, they couldn't settle them anywhere. 
    Now, I might say to you and I dislike even reading one sentence from a -- an annotator who has gone over these decisions but I'm going to read it because I don't agree with it entirely. 
    It's in 20 A.L.R.2d 1393, he said it has been suggested that a valid ex parte decree rendered by a Court at the matrimonial domicile, which under the law, that place has the effect of terminating some wife's right to alimony. 
    He should be entitled to recognition in that respect even though a valid ex parte decree of any other State would not be so entitled. 
    That would be a direct answer to your question but I don't think that suggestion goes far enough. 
    That is really Thompson versus Thompson. 
    I say in addition to that to give it full faith and credit you must have two things. 
    There must be a statute whereby you can get service by publication, which is reasonably calculated to give notice to the pleading spouse. 
    And secondly, in this case, it seems to me it is reinforce. 
    It went under that statute as shown by the record on pages 302 and 303 that the pleading spouse did actually get notice and she refused to appear because otherwise, if we do not hold that, I think, it goes to the extreme in forum shop, a man and a wife were married, went up and thinks the forum isn't as favorable. 
    We can get larger alimony over in Indiana. 
    Let's go there. 
    And she goes over to -- to Indiana. 
    She can't ever get any alimony unless he comes in there personally or let's say the spouse goes to another jurisdiction and she's powerless to get anything and suppose he'd taken all the General Motor stock with him, then down in -- and left her in Florida. 
    In order for her to get alimony, she'd have to come up to Ohio and I think unless we have that rule where there must be one state at least which can settle all the problems and it doesn't in any way overrule or sidetrack the rule in the Estin case, it reinforces it. 
    All we say is this, that when Estin was decided and Haddock versus Haddock was overruled. 
    What actually happen was, you said formally in Haddock that the state of the matrimonial domicile had exclusive jurisdiction, but when you come to the Williams cases and Estin you say, "Oh no." 
    Wherever they go to establish a domicile, that can have -- that State can have jurisdiction too. 
    But you don't say in the same one fell sweep and never have said and I hope you'll never will for. 
    Well, the matrimonial domicile has lost all its powers to adjudicate, simply because one of the spouses fled. 
    But if you uphold this decree of Ohio that would be the effect and so I want to say in conclusion.

    I find it and probably -- and point at all. 
    I think the matter is a simple one when it comes down to is this and I have never changed my position on it. 
    I have cited the Thompson versus Thompson because if that's still the law, this has to be reverse. 
    If you're going to modify Thompson versus Thompson just a little bit, I still said it has to be reverse. 
    But when you come to the question whether you have full faith and credit or not, isn't it after all a question whether or not due process was rendered in the Florida courts, if there was due process in the Florida courts, then it seems to me the questions are all over it. 
    And if we take Pennoyer versus Neff strictly, and we'll not say anything against Pennoyer, then of course we lose. 
    But I say on a general theory of Milliken versus Meyer and the easy manner in which now we say minimal contacts there was due process.
