    Mr. Bowen 
    -- petition denial (Inaudible) judicial knowledge, or whether that point out to the Court that he has had a fair and adequate opportunity in a previous petition to present the question now presented judicially known to the Court. 
    The order is in the same form. 
    Now, I do not think that this order shows a decision on the merits. 
    All it does is to say that he has failed to show probable cause. 
    Supreme Court of Florida takes judicial notice of its own record. 
    It said that time and again and that -- and then the cases where they -- it shows the application of that rule. 
    Now, Supreme Court of Florida, in the present case here, if this order is quite consistent with the disposition on the part of that Court, knowing as we do, judicially, that Durley, (Inaudible) record, that he has raised the same federal question in 1952 that he now seeks to raise. 
    He hasn't, in truth and in fact, shown probable cause showing it's illegal, was detained because we know that that's barred as a matter of res judicata. 
    Or they could have said, if they thought that there was no res judicata, if they thought that the federal question had not been raised in 1952, they could have said themselves, why we know, as a matter of judicial knowledge, that he had a fair and adequate opportunity in 1952 to raise this question and since he did have, nothing he says here, shows any probable cause to -- to think he ought to be turned out

    Justice Reed 
    Did -- did I understand, before the recess, that -- that you said this was rather a standard --
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="118.527" stopTime="133.970">
    Mr. Bowen 
    That is the standard form of order. 
    I -- I -- that was my recollection. 
    I checked it with the clerk over the telephone sometime ago. 
    They've been using that standard form of order and a denial for many years with exception. 
    I'll grant you that at times --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="133.970" stopTime="134.267">
    Justice Reed 
    Correct.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="134.267" stopTime="371.534">
    Mr. Bowen 
    -- like Irvin against Chapman and -- and Washington against Mayo, in State ex rel.Johnson against Mayo, they had also filed an order to enunciate some principle that they think they ought to take time out from their -- from their busy labors for writing opinion about and they will deviate from that rule when they want to write an opinion but all -- in all other cases, this is the form of order that is used regardless of what I urge as a reason for denial. 
    So, there's nothing about the form of this order that says the -- they considered the thing on the merits because he certainly had not shown any reason to think he'd been illegally detained if everything he said was barred by -- and judicially known to them to be barred either by the doctrine of res judicata or by the other doctrine that he had a fair and adequate opportunity to raise it before and didn't. 
    Now, he didn't attempt to bring himself, in this case, to decide in 1955 down there. 
    He didn't attempt to make the slightest excuse for not having raised the question in 1952, if, in fact, he thought he had not raised it. 
    I submit that he did raise the federal question in 1952. 
    But if he had thought that he did not raise it, he made no effort to bring himself under the Johnson case by giving an excuse for not having raised it. 
    Presumably, he had a fair and adequate opportunity because he had counsel and knew everything then that he knows now. 
    To get on to the merits of the proposition of double jeopardy or double punishment, I point out that in each case, the trial court judged Durley to be guilty of the offense charged in each count. 
    There were three counts in each case. 
    In case number 4179 it would best but nonetheless, the first or when he gets the first sentences in. 
    The judge sentenced him for your offense charged in the first count. 
    Then he sentenced him for your said offense charged in the second count to run consecutively with the sentence under the first count. 
    Under the third count, he said, for -- for your said offense charged in the third count. 
    And sentenced -- and made that sentence run consecutively to the other two. 
    He did that over -- he did that in number 4172, also. 
    And I submit to the Court that under the circumstances, that was a finding by the trial court that there were, in truth and in fact, three separate crimes charged in each information. 
    Now, under the law of Florida, it is quite possible that under some circumstances quite permissible to allege several separate and distinct crimes in several counts of an information. 
    For example, the (Inaudible) case that came up from Tampa charged four separate and distinct acts of receiving stolen property. 
    They were days apart. 
    The information showed that. 
    Each of the -- the several counts showed that there were days and sometimes weeks apart. 
    And yet, the Supreme Court of Florida held that -- that under the circumstances, that was quite proper to not only charge it that way but to convict him on each count and to sentence him on each count to run consecutively because they were actually four different crimes. 
    Now, the law of Florida on larceny is as Mr. Rutledge just stated it to you --

    I don't think (Voice Overlap) -- and certainly the indictment doesn't or the information doesn't allege it.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="393.987" stopTime="408.214">
    Mr. Bowen 
    No, it does not allege one way or the other. 
    But the trial judge, after hearing the evidence, having heard the case tried, had judged him guilty of and sentenced him for three crimes in each case.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="408.214" stopTime="410.607">
    Justice Burton 
    Well, he might have thought that there were three crimes --
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="410.607" stopTime="410.937">
    Mr. Bowen 
    Well if he -- if he --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="410.937" stopTime="411.823">
    Justice Burton 
    -- (Voice Overlap) 
    the same time.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="411.823" stopTime="422.668">
    Mr. Bowen 
    -- if he did and so adjudged, why that's conclusive. 
    The records can't be attacked cleverly and -- and made to say something different to what they do say. 
    And I submit --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="422.668" stopTime="423.295">
    Justice Burton 
    But did the --
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="423.295" stopTime="523.328">
    Mr. Bowen 
    -- that when he judged him guilty of three separate crimes in each case and sentenced him for three separate crimes, that that's conclusive and binding on the one except perhaps on direct appeal. 
    On direct appeal, if the evidence had gone to Supreme Court of Florida and if the evidence had actually shown that that wasn't the case, that -- that there actually was only one crime, they would have reversed as they did in the Hearn case that Mr. Rutledge had cited. 
    Now, the Hearn case is authority for -- for the -- for the proposition that where several things, animals or what not are stolen from the same owner at the same time and place and under the same circumstances that's one larceny and not more than one. 
    But, the Hearn case also recognized that if -- it's a different time or different places or under different circumstances that it's immaterial whether it's from the same owner or not. 
    They didn't say it in -- in these words but the case stands for this proposition that it's immaterial that it's on the same date. 
    And so, with that being the law of Florida and with the trial judge having heard the evidence and presumably knowing what the law of Florida was, and when he then find adjudged him guilty of and sentenced him for six offenses, I submit that that is sufficient to withstand collateral attacks anywhere on these circumstances.

    Justice Black 
    Do you mean that -- do you mean that if it's hard to admit it that he was bearing six sentences or six different offenses that barred and wouldn't supply any remedy for such a situation. 
    If that -- if that's why he admitted the fact --
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="550.615" stopTime="695.105">
    Mr. Bowen 
    I won't go that far. 
    I think that, very likely, habeas corpus would lie if it would admit the facts that he had been sentenced more than one time for the same offense. 
    I'll give an illustration of why I say that. 
    There's a case but yet, within the last year so I can't remember the name where a prisoner had been and I'll -- first I'll say that our law on our statute on desertion and nonsupport is all ruled into one, desertion and -- and nonsupport, this order as for other, and it's all in one statute and it's held one fairly over one year. 
    In the first count, the State charged him with -- with desertion. 
    In the second count, it charged him with nonsupport during the same period as the desertion and of the same charge. 
    And so, he applied for habeas corpus -- he -- the judge sentenced him to -- to one year on the first count, one year on the second count to run consecutively. 
    After he had served one year, he applied to Supreme Court of Florida for habeas corpus and that Court held and properly so that desertion comprehends with it the nonsupport, the failure to support his child and that since he had been sentenced under the first count which embraced everything that was in the second count as -- as minor -- as a lesser ingredient or as -- as if included part of it. 
    And -- and he didn't have to serve one year because one year was the maximum provided by the statute. 
    That was the decision by this Court. 
    And I'm inclined to believe that if there were no other impediment -- if there were no impediment in its way on procedural grounds, that if he, who admitted the fact that he had been sentenced more than -- to more than one sentence for the same offense that -- that he would be heard and he would be cut loose from another sentence.

    Mr. Bowen 
    Yes, but the record of the trial court which cannot be impeded, adjudged him guilty of six offenses and sentenced him for six offenses as I construe it.

    The record tended to show to the contrary that there had been only one crime committed and he took that position and the State took the same position and brief the case and -- and pointed out to the Court just what I've attempted to explain that the record, if it wasn't an assault, it was upon what the record show, that the record was entirely consisted with his claim and even supported his claim that the second count embraced only what was charged in the first count because it charged, they were the same children and the same period of time, and it could not have been, otherwise, then he -- at least he said he was -- he wasn't trying to impeach a record, he would be going --

    Not where -- they're prepared on page -- I thought that this Court had cited many, many times that if the record says that this way, that's the way we must deal with, I'm talking about the record proper, I'm not talking about things not around the edge and this case, we have before the Court now, is in the record proper of the judgment in sentence. 
    Another thing that can be attacked on coram nobis is where a plea has been induced even by fear of mode of violence or by coercion or duress or something of that sort, and perhaps, there are other things too but it is of -- I think they were to consider a claim by the man -- by a man that he was insane at the time he was tried, but I think they had probably considered that on coram nobis. 
    It has a limited application but it has never been thought in Florida to -- to be permissible either on coram nobis or habeas corpus to contradict the record proper.

    It -- it certainly -- it certainly was the only way that I see that that our record showing can be undone or circumvented is by direct appeal. 
    Now, I can't conceive of -- of a defendant coming to Court on habeas corpus and say, "I didn't have a lawyer when I was tried," I should have had one because of the seriousness of the charge and my inability to represent myself on the count of being as to what not and attached to that petition a certified copy of the record of the trial court which showed that he did have a lawyer and was represented through us. 
    I can't conceive of him being able to -- to collaterally dispute that record and as such fashion, I don't think it's the law even to this Court. 
    I know it's not the law of Florida, because if the record prompted that is the clerk's men of what transpired at the trial, they import absolute bearing and if they say that he was represented by counsel, he was represented by counsel so far as a collateral attack is concerned. 
    And it's up to him if those minutes are incorrect, he has a remedy, he had the right to go to the Court and show that they're wrong and get an order and correct him to manage.

    I'm not sure that I understand but let's see if we do. 
    If the judge had simply said under the first count, “I'll give you five years, second count, five years, third count, five years to all run consecutively, it might well be argued that he had not found him guilty of the one offense because frequently, it's quite true that the second count was charged of the same crime and -- and in a different way in order to meet the proof as it might come in at the trial and the third count will -- will do likewise and so on. 
    There's no saying how many counts you might have.

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="1425.039" stopTime="1545.403">
    Mr. Bowen 
    Actually, a judgment and sentence can be of a varied brief, all that a judgment implied under the statute is -- is adjudication of guilt and all in the sentence, of course, imposed a punishment, and it would be quite sufficient if the record laid a proper predicate for the judgment of sentence. 
    Perhaps, if he's convicted by a jury or be guilty or be quite enough if the judge said, "I hereby judge you to be guilty as charged in information and I sentence you so and so." 
    Usually, although more formal, they say, if the judgment of the Court that you are -- that the Court hereby judges you to be guilty and so forth and if the judgment in Court would sentence a law that you'd be confined under state prison for so much time and things of that sort. 
    But, whether the Court agrees with me on this matter of the merits or not, I want to say one go -- go back to my original pieces for just a moment to say that despite the fact that at least one member of the Court points out that in Washington against Mayo, the Court did apparently based its decision on two points, one, that he'd had a previous opportunity and have to bail himself off it, and two, on the merits. 
    Despite that, they did lay down the previous opportunity rule and they might have and probably did invoke that rule in this case of Dan Durley. 
    And they also might well have invoked the rule in -- in the Johnson case that where he deals no excuse for not having raised it before, he's waived it forward and it won't be heard now.

    Mr. Bowen 
    If it please the Court, it was before this case was held, began to come into this Court 30 years ago, I -- it's just to come -- well, I - there might have been some or in most of them have been since then, it were just a common practice in the Court for our practice for-- if a defendant didn't have and I'm -- couldn't get his own lawyer charged him with a serious crime for the Court to reach out and grab a lawyer fraction to that bar and said, "Now you come in here and represent this man, just as a matter of course." 
    Now I grant you that all judges don't have the same due of what's right in pleading as -- that most of them do and it could well be that a -- that there'd be an isolated instance of a judge that wouldn't give a man counsel when he is entitled to another Constitution. 
    You might recall the Wade Mill case for trying to reach this Court a few years ago from -- from Florida County. 
    If I recall right, the Wade Mill case was bought them squarely upon the proposition that a boy, age of 18 years old, charged with a serious crime, unable to represent himself because of the ignorance the man experienced was entitled constitutionally towards -- to counsel. 
    I think this Court so held and it's held that in many other cases too. 
    And by and large, that's the rule they supplied in Florida and if it wasn't applied, and it was shown to Supreme Court of Florida that it should have been implied, they would see that it was applied.

    There are certain cases, if for instance, it'd come under the Betts-Brady rule where defendant is tried by the judge without a jury upon a waiver of -- of jury trial where the judge doesn't feel that it's necessary to appoint counsel because it's his firm intention to see that it is right to safeguard it all the way along. 
    And in a case of that sort, sometimes a judge will not appoint counsel even if the man requested.

    Justice Frankfurter 
    To what extent are juries waived in a jury if criminal cases have been filed?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="1908.930" stopTime="2040.447">
    Mr. Bowen 
    May it please, Your Honor. 
    In Dave County, where Miami is situated, I -- there's a criminal court of record in the court of crimes in the Circuit Court -- Circuit Court capital cases for the crime of misdemeanors, criminal court of record all furnished up to capital. 
    And I have been told by a counsel practicing before that Court that around 95% of the defendants waive trial by jury, that's before Judge Ben C.Willard in Miami. 
    Now in Jacksonville, the situation is not that way. 
    There are reasons why they do waive their counsel. 
    The record goes by and when they have counsel, they've been these many times advised them that has waived trial here. 
    That we -- we --- we're better off if we do in -- in all respects, whatever he does tell him. 
    Over in Jacksonville, now they don't have but -- they don't have but one criminal court of record to try the hundreds of cases that come before that Court every year. 
    Just literally hundreds of them and Judge Willard can try a lot of them in -- in pretty short order because he's used to -- to the things that are important and he doesn't waste all day (Inaudible) 
    But over in Jacksonville where they have a lesser population, considerably less, I think they'd counted and got about 703,000 according to a recent federal census, special census. 
    Duval County maybe 300,000, approximately, 350,000, I don't know exactly, half or less in population. 
    They have a -- a situation there. 
    It's true, they don't have a court of crimes and they have misdemeanors too, but they found it necessary to install another court there recently with the same jurisdiction as the criminal court of record because they didn't waive the jury trials there like they did in Dade County and they -- and it just takes time and more time to try jury cases much more than it does to try a case without a jury. 
    It's --

    No, sir, not predominantly. 
    There is a -- is a reason. 
    I don't -- I can't -- I don't want to be unfair to anyone but I have been told by lawyers in Miami that they prefer to try cases without a jury before Judge Willard and recommend to their clients that they do so for several reasons. 
    One, it expedites the case and gets over with and they have -- they said they haven't anchored up to -- to prevent a case but it does get it over with. 
    And second, they tell me that their experience has taught them that Judge Willard will give them breaks if there's any to be had from the case made that a jury might, probably wouldn't give him. 
    In other words, he -- he is inclined to give them the benefit of doubts that they tell me a jury might not give them. 
    And I -- I've been told that that is, perhaps, a major reason that they prefer to try him before Judge Willard. 
    That he convicts a lot of people now. 
    The three records in the Supreme Court of Florida shows that he does. 
    But they -- they've told me that that's a -- a major reason why they do waive so much. 
    But as I say, all over State, here and there, you'll find they're waiving the jury and -- and trying a case before the judge, some -- some counties more than others. 
    But none of them that reached the proportions that was obtained in Dade County.

    Justice Harlan 
    Do you regard this sentence as a very unusual one for this type of offense?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2190.743" stopTime="2321.467">
    Mr. Bowen 
    No, sir. 
    I don't at all. 
    I think that if there were -- if there were three separate larcenies in each case as the trial judge found any judgment in sentence that it was not in the least unusual. 
    Nothing -- nothing cruel and unusual certainly, because under the law of Florida, each larceny of cattle is subject to be punished by imprisonment for five years. 
    And it -- it was just -- it was -- now why -- I don't suppose I'm at liberty to tell you why. 
    I know -- know things outside the record as only why I think that the -- that much sentence was imposed in this case. 
    But certain it is that there's nothing unlawful about it. 
    There' nothing cruel or unusual about giving to pay or giving a man a five-year sentence for each separate and distinct offense of larceny of cattle. 
    I have known of innumerable instances where a lessee was just charged in stealing one cow or one calf. 
    That he got five years. 
    And if he committed six crimes, he's certainly subject to being sentenced six times for those six thefts, five years apiece. 
    As I understand the rule that this Court has laid down in Louisiana against Resweber, the current and unusual punishment doctrine applies to the method of punishment. 
    And here, I point out that he has no method of punishment imposed on him, that's the slightest bit different from anybody else. 
    That it is better to him being 50 years old or whatever the -- the record shows him to be. 
    It is, as I see it, totally unimportant. 
    A -- a 50-year old man or whatever his age is, is just as guilty of stealing cows if he -- if he steals them as a 20-year old man is, and he started to exactly the same point but he knew how old he was when he stole them if he stole them.

    Mr. Bowen 
    I do submit most earnestly that he'd had a day in Court.

    Justice Black 
    And that irrespective, and assuming that he's serving a 30-year sentence, when under Florida law, nobody could legally be given more than 10 that he has no remedy.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2501.291" stopTime="2511.710">
    Mr. Bowen 
    I'd say at the present time that I know of no remedy that he has.

    Justice Black 
    As it is, well I -- I suppose it wouldn't be relevant to ask you what I was about to ask (Inaudible) 
    It's a rather strange situation to me.

    Mr. Bowen 
    Well, it is -- it is different and it -- it hadn't been different, this Court would now grant a certiorari, I take it. 
    It is a different situation from the average case. 
    It comes to the appeal on petition for certiorari. 
    No doubt of that, but the -- if he has remedy today, I don't know what it is.

    May I ask you this?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2549.574" stopTime="2555.620">

    May I ask you this, I want to make sure exactly what it is that you (Inaudible) 
    Do I understand you to suggest that if this case on the record we now have, that he didn't claim, had come up before the Supreme Court of Florida on appeal from the conviction, that Court would have found the error and made revision of the sentence.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2580.534" stopTime="2601.440">
    Mr. Bowen 
    If he -- if the -- if he'd taken it up to the Supreme Court of Florida on direct appeal with the testimony and claimed at that time that there actually were only two crimes committed instead of six and the record had so revealed, I have to say the Supreme Court of Florida would have reversed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2601.440" stopTime="2604.085">
    Justice Frankfurter 
    Yes, but do we know if the record would have told you?

    Mr. Bowen 
    I don't know what the record would have shown, sir.

    I -- I have --I have never had the benefit of examining the record because as I said, I don't think anyone was ever prepared.

    I'm not certain that I understand that.

    You're saying that the -- the only - the only thing that we could infer from your question this argument of yours, not that we can say if we have taken an appeal that doesn't -- that would have to impede except that it was illegal.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2646.457" stopTime="2647.503">

    Justice Frankfurter 
    You cannot say on this record, that's your position. 
    That merely because he didn't take an appeal to be serving 30 years maybe instead of 10.

    Mr. Bowen 
    I don't see how it can be so decided in the face of the trial court's finding that he committed six crimes.

    Justice Black 
    Now, I understand it further that the -- if his allegations are true, or that -- that the Attorney General's office is evident, it has not even made inquiries to ascertain whether or not his allegations are true, which if true, would show that he was serving 30 years sentence where the law could not legally give him the 10.

    No, sir.

    Mr. Rutledge 
    Your Honor, I would just like to correct an answer which I made to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, about corroboration under Florida law as the -- my colleague pointed this. 
    And for me, Florida has a rule that corroboration is not required --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2752.496" stopTime="2752.546">
    Unknown Speaker 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="neal_p_rutledge" startTime="2752.546" stopTime="3023.374">
    Mr. Rutledge 
    --in support of conviction and on the basis of the testimony of an accomplice. 
    The judge does charge the jury to examine such testimony with care. 
    I should also, on the jurisdictional point, like to refer this Court to the Williams versus Georgia case which was decided, I believe, in the last term which stated, as I understand it, that a State may be freed to lay down a rule that you cannot raise your federal question except to the particular point and that a state procedural rule which forbids raising the federal question at late stages in the case or by any other than the prescribed method has been recognized as a valid exercise of state power. 
    But the Court went on in that case, as I understand it, to say that where the State does allow such matters in the Court's discretion, but then the U.S.Supreme Court, this Court may review the operation of such discretion, otherwise, it loses power over its own jurisdiction, and I submit that that certainly is precisely this case. 
    The case has shown the Florida Supreme Court certainly -- we contend first of all, if it had any discretion in this case at all, certainly, exercised that discretion in ruling on the merits of this petition, and in any event, it has a discretion as shown by this decision, Florida decisions and that discretion, the use of that discretion is subject to review by this Court. 
    I should like to also point out that in regard to the point of habeas corpus line to -- but General Bowen refers to impeach the record and I would like to refer in that regard to the Shoemaker case, Shoemaker versus Mayo. 
    In that case, a man had pleaded guilty for the charge and he was permitted by habeas corpus to come in and challenge the -- the plea on the record by claiming that at the time he made that plea, he was under the influence of -- of a narcotic drug. 
    In short, he was able to go in and challenge that plea by the means of habeas corpus, and indeed, this Court, in a very recent case, Chandler versus Fretag had before it, the very same situation in which General Bowen mentioned of the record in that case came from Tennessee, specifically stated that counsel was present but petitioner in that case was permitted by witnesses to come in and show the contrary, the exact contrary that he had no counsel and indeed after he had made in pursuance of showing by witnesses, the State conceded the error in the record. 
    I should also like to point out finally, in regard to this res judicata point, that the (Inaudible) affidavit - the affidavit which states that these - the evidentiary point, in other words, the condition of the record that the testimony of these two accomplices show that these cattle were all taken at the same time. 
    That affidavit was never attached to any prior petition. 
    It was -- the affidavit was made in 1955, I believe, and it was attached only to this last petition. 
    And indeed, we submitted that if you examine the 1952 petition, it will show on its face that it challenges only the face of the record. 
    It states in paragraph 2 and paragraph 5 or section - Article 2 or Article 5 of the petition. 
    It state that the counts and I'm quoting now, “Do in fact charge the one and the same crime.” 
    And again paragraph 5, "That the two informations aforesaid do make out for two crimes." 
    In other words, the whole thrust of that petition was at the face of the informations, not at what the testimony produced. 
    This is the only case where petitioner has raised this point. 
    That on the evidence produced by the State, he was unlawfully convicted three times for a single offense. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice Warren 
    Mr. Rutledge I -- on behalf of the Court, I should like to thank you for having accepted this assignment for the Court and for the enlightenment you -- you have given us. 
    I -- I believe that every American can take more -- can take comfort and have an added sense of security that the lawyers are willing to accept assignments such as this without compensation and pursue them as diligently as you have. 
    But Mr. Bowen, I say that, of course, without belittling at all, the service you have rendered to your client, the State of Florida.
