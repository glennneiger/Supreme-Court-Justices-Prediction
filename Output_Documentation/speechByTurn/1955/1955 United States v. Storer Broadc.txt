    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    Your Honors, in answer to a question yesterday by Mr. Justice Frankfurter concerning the scope of the hearing required by Section 309 (b) of the Act, I misspoke myself in referring the Court to the Nelson Brothers case, the case which I intended to refer to is one which is also cited in our brief, Commission against National Broadcasting Company KOA 319 U.S. 239. 
    In that case, there was an application by a Boston Station for an increase in power, the effect of which if granted would be to constitute an interference with the Denver Station KOA and to that extent a modification of the KOA clear channel license. 
    And under then Section 312 (b) of the Act a modification of license could not be effected without affording the licensee an opportunity to show cause why it should not be modified.

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    The question that I put -- that you just put, Your Honor, it seems to me is -- is meant very clearly by the proposition that the Act itself requires a hearing for the purpose of determining the public interest in the grant of the application. 
    And therefore, unless that statutory provision is subject to some implied qualification which has not yet been read into, then the applicant is entitled to a hearing with all of the consequences of that hearing to show what the public interest is. 
    That KOA case is an interest in another rather collateral respect, in that, it points out the congressional interest. 
    In the conduct of those hearings by the Commission itself in order that it may keep abreast of a dynamic and developing industry in radio broadcasting which that Congress quite clearly considered and properly considered could not be determinative of the public interest on any static basis.

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    I have not attempted to suggest or attempt to define here all of the situations in which the Commission may properly adopt rules because I apprehend that that question is not before this Court. 
    I simply state here that the particular rules under attack, the numerical proscription rules are inconsistent by their very terms that Section 309 (b) of the Act. 
    And that they have not been shown to be necessary to carry out any other provision of the Act. 
    I have also pointed out that in the only cases which it thus far been decided where any question is raised as to that right to a hearing that that -- those situations are completely answered by the fact that in those cases that Congress itself has declared what the public interest is, as for example, a grant of a license to an alien so that the hearing would be a futile gesture because Congress hasn't left to the Commission the determination of the public interest in that case.

    I can give you an illustration precisely along that line which is Section 311 of the Act which prohibits the Commission from granting a license to anyone whose license has been revoked under Section 313 of the Act in an anti-trust proceeding by a court. 
    Now, that's a situation where quite clearly a hearing, if the facts were admitted about the revocation of the license, there couldn't be any -- there wasn't -- wouldn't be any question of public interest open for determination by the Commission because the Congress itself has said that that would (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    I think not, sir. 
    I think not, sir, because the Commission itself concedes that the number, numerical ownership, which the rules prescribe, are not in violation of any law. 
    And once that concession has been made and indeed there can't be any question about the mere ownership of five or six nations doesn't violate the anti-trust laws. 
    Once that concession has been made, then there is no showing which would deprive, operate to deprive the applicant of the right to a hearing under 309 (b) to determine what the public interest is in that question of ownership. 
    If it were violative of the anti-trust law, then, I would have no question at all, as Your Honor had suggested. 
    Clearly they could adopt the rule which prohibited a license under those circumstances.

    That's in the criminal code. 
    And yet this Court held it proper to adopt rules excluding a license to one who proposed to operate in violation of that section of the criminal code. 
    I don't -- I don't -- it isn't as narrow a position as that. 
    I say where the Congress has determined the public interest in question either in the Communications Act or elsewhere, then it has taken away from the Commission the power to make that determination of public interest because the Congress has itself determined the public interest. 
    But I do not restrict my argument merely to the specific provisions of the Communications Act.

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    The Chain Broadcasting rules for the most part did involve problems of conflict with the Communications Act itself.

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    Yes. 
    For example one such rule in the Chain Broadcasting rules had to do with the control exercise by a non-licensee over the operation of the station and that involves a violation of Section 301 of the Act. 
    That while it is true that those Chain Broadcasting regulations did involve that type of conflict with the Communications Act, I -- I do not suggest to Your Honors that that is the only situation in which the Congress could have declared or has declared the public interest. 
    Now to --

    Aren't -- aren't there many rules that -- aren't there rules that will say that you won't have high frequency, we'll have stations operating on the same frequencies.
speaker="albert_r_connelly" startTime="663.273" stopTime="719.679">
    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    As -- as I call Your Honors' attention yesterday, there is another section of the Act, 307 (b) which requires the Commission to allocate frequencies on a nationwide basis to provide efficient, fair, and equitable distribution among the States and communities. 
    Now, that is a provision of the Act which admittedly involves an inconsistency with the public interest involved in an individual application because if the Commission has carried out that mandate of the Congress and has allocated the frequencies so that there isn't a frequency available for an individual community or a frequency of a particular kind available to individual community, then it is not in a position to determine the public interest in an application by me for example for a frequency that just doesn't exist.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    The provision which fixes the maximum number of stations which they proscribe.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    That no matter what the maximum was taken.
speaker="albert_r_connelly" startTime="805.730" stopTime="1534.105">
    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    No matter what the maximum fix, yes. 
    That leads me directly into -- into the second branch of the argument. 
    Because it is our contention here as it was in the court below that these numerical proscription rules are invalid not only because they deny the hearing under Section 309 (b) but because they are arbitrary in that they exclude required consideration of relevant factors and their basis is not adequately disclosed. 
    Now, I pointed out to Your Honors yesterday that the order promulgating these rules was founded upon the anti-trust sections of the Communications Act and that the Commission had had ceased two aspects of that, the program diversification policy and the policy preventing undue concentration of economic control. 
    I think I also pointed out that the anti-trust provisions of the Communications Act merely declare applicable to radio, all the laws of the United States relating to unlawful restraints and monopolies and the combinations, contracts or agreements in restraint of trade. 
    In other words, there isn't any legislation, anti-trust legislation applicable to radio which is not also applicable to all industry. 
    And the anti-trust laws, both statutory and as they have been construed by the Court do not proscribe any acquisition except upon the basis of actual or potential effect upon competition. 
    And determination of the effect upon competition requires consideration of a variety of factors, requires consideration of the purpose of the acquisition. 
    The size and location of the acquiring interest and of the acquired interest, the existence and strength of competitors in the market affected as this Court pointed out in the Columbia Steel case. 
    We look to the percentage of business control, the strength of the remaining competition whether the action springs from business requirements or purpose to monopolize the probable development of the industry, consumer demands, and other characteristics of the market. 
    These rules make one factor, multiple ownership controlling to the exclusion of all other relevant factors, although the multiple ownership rules themselves in the sections immediately preceding the numerical proscription hereunder attack expressly recognize differences as the rule state in size, extent, and location of areas served, differences in numbers of people served, differences in the extent of other competitive service to the areas in question. 
    I ask Your Honors to consider these numerical proscription rules in the light of those three factors. 
    First, size, extent, and location of areas served. 
    These rules do not take that factor into account at all. 
    Indeed, they create an arbitrary and false presumption that a T.V. station in say, Butte, Montana is to be equated because it's one with the T.V. station in New York City. 
    The rules ignore completely the factor of the number of people served. 
    Now, in that connection, Your Honor, there is a footnote reference in the Government's reply brief at page 14 -- at page 14, referring presumably in an effort to show the salutary effect of these rules in preventing undue expansion of Storer to the fact that the metropolitan areas served by Storer's television stations have a population of some seven million persons. 
    Now, that statistic is not in the record. 
    It is not -- it has not been referred to previously in this proceeding, but it is based upon the 1950 census of the metropolitan areas which are, in fact, served by Storer's T.V. station. 
    And therefore, I think it appropriate to call to Your Honors' attention, using the same 1950 census figures, the fact that there are other multiple owners operating under exactly the same multiple ownership rules serving vastly larger populations. 
    DuMont for example, 14 million, General Teleradio, 20 million, Columbia Broadcasting, 23 million, National Broadcasting, 27 million, American Broadcasting, 28 million. 
    I think that illustrates one of the points of attack here. 
    Because if for example, American Broadcasting gave up one of its five T.V. stations, say in San Francisco, with a metropolitan population of approximately two million, thereby reducing its population statistic to 26 million, it would be eligible to receive a license for a new station for which Storer, with its seven million statistic would be ineligible to receive. 
    The third factor and perhaps the most important in the light of the -- of our purposes of these rules, the extent of other competitive service to the areas in question, a factor which is totally disregarded by these numerical proscription rules that points out the fact that they are not at all related to the alleged policy, I shouldn't say alleged policy, to the policy of program diversification which is alleged as a basis for the rules. 
    Because they preclude consideration of the view points and programs available in any given area that they operate and apply only the stations serving different areas. 
    Let me illustrate that. 
    The service area of the T.V. station can be measured by a radius of approximately 60 miles maximum. 
    An application is made for a license to operate a station in Miami, Florida. 
    The fact that an applicant has an interest in a station, a T.V. station in Detroit, Michigan, and have no possible relationship, the program diversification either in Miami or in Detroit or in anywhere else. 
    These rules exclude a multiple owner from areas in which there are more facilities when there are applicants. 
    Indeed, by their expressed terms, they would exclude an otherwise qualified applicant, a multiple owner, in an area not served by any existing facility, even if there were not any other applicant for facility there. 
    If those factors which I have referred to and which are in the multiple ownership rules themselves are relevant in considering an increase in number of stations from four to five, why aren't they equally relevant in considering an increase from five to six. 
    What is the magic of the number five or the number seven? 
    I hope Your Honors will direct that questions specifically to Mr. Baker because up to this point there hasn't been the slightest attempt to meet that problem. 
    There isn't any attempt by the Commission here to relate the specific limitations which they have adopted, either to the anti-monopoly policy or to the program diversification policy. 
    Now, in that connection, I don't want to be unfair to the Commission in any respect and I would like therefore to confine my comments here for those reasons. 
    That the precise language used by the Commission in its report, in ostensible support for these limitations. 
    First, in the case of AM, the number seven was selected, why? 
    In order that the present holdings of such stations be not unduly disrupted, clearly, no relationship in that to the avowed purposes of the rules. 
    In the case of FM, this is at page 31 of the record, the number seven was selected, why? 
    Because it is considered desirable to have the same limitation applicable to both AM and FM. 
    Now what relationship does that have to the avowed purposes of the rules? 
    And finally at page 30 of the record in the case of T.V. the number five is selected because it is the existing limitation on T.V. station ownership which in our judgment based on extensive experience with the problems of multiple ownership have proven practicable and desirable and that's it and that's all. 
    Not only is that unrelated to the avowed purposes of the rule, that statement with reference to television is a meaningless abstraction. 
    The Commission points to and can point to, no instance whatever of any experience with ownership in more than the specified number of television stations. 
    There isn't any basis shown in the Commission's report or in the record for the specific limits which the Commission has imposed. 
    The reason they're stated could apply with equal force or lack of force in my view that the number 17 or 77 or any other number that might be pulled out of a hat. 
    In that connection I should like to call Your Honors' attention to a statement which I think significant by Commissioner Dorfman in 1954 in connection with the modification so as to provide two additional ultrahigh frequency stations as distinguished from VHF stations. 
    Commissioner Dorfman said, “I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of picking a number without more reliable and persuasive evidence that the number chosen within all cases mark the upper limit of what will safeguard the public interest.” 
    There is not much more than intuition as the basis for the present rule."

    It's quite clear in that case that the courts will not interfere with the action taken by the administrative agency because they are supposed to have the expertise so long as there as a reasonable basis upon which they might have acted.

    But the Congress has not said that anything that the administrative agency determines is automatically free from inquiry on the contrary. 
    They have specifically written into the law, provisions for judicial review. 
    And I submit that those provisions for judicial review are meaningless unless they enable the Court to insist that if there are rules adopted like this, there must be some basis shown so that the Court itself can determine whether the figures selected are within a reasonable range, not that there is a right figure. 
    That isn't the point but so that there is some basis for tying up in making the relationship between the number that they select and the interest that they are suppose to subserve.

    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    Our precise point though, one of our precise points in this case is that the Commission in its order here, adopting these rules has not laid bear its mind in such a fashion that this Court can properly come to a determination as to whether its within the realm of reason or not. 
    Now, the Commission --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1919.077" stopTime="1923.407">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Wasn't this rule -- wasn't this rule formulated after a long hearing?
speaker="albert_r_connelly" startTime="1923.407" stopTime="2139.560">
    Mr. Albert R. Connelly 
    A proposed rule was announced back in 1948, not the rule which is actually adopted but in general covered the same area. 
    Hearings were held in 1949 and then nothing else happened. 
    Until the end was a hearing, arguments were made. 
    Until the end of 1953, some four years after the -- the arguments on the question, the Commission came out with these rules effective 1954. 
    The hearing and the record of that hearing to the extent that either party has thought it important is included in the records and appeals so that if there's anything at all that took place in that hearing which justifies the action the Commission took is in this little brown record here. 
    And I submit that Your Honors will find absolutely nothing beyond what I have read to you which purports to support those limitations. 
    Now the Commission, in its report, did take cognizance of the widespread criticism of the proposed rules that they were arbitrary. 
    They -- they gave no answer to that argument which said simply, “well anything else would be unsatisfactory or unworkable.” 
    But again, to use the Commission's own language and this is at page 22 of the record, paragraph 11. 
    In view of the arguments advanced by some party that the proposed rules are arbitrary and that they give no effect to class and size of stations, geographical locations, populations served, and similar factors, we have considered alternatives to the present proposal. 
    But as a result of the study of the present holdings of multiple owners, we have concluded that any proposal to limit multiple ownership on the basis of such factors as class of station, geographical location is either unsatisfactory or unworkable. 
    Now, I submit that that observation would reasonably justify a conclusion that no formula should be adopted but it clearly does not justify the conclusion that an arbitrary formula can be adopted. 
    These rules in our view are invalid because they repudiate the congressional intent that anti-trust questions be determined on the basis of the facts with respect to competition and because they repudiate the congressional intent that the public interest, convenience and necessity in the ground of licences be determined with reference to the relevant and all the relevant facts. 
    As this Court stated in the Miller case in 294 U.S. involving administrative regulation equating the loss of a hand with total disability, the Court said the vice of the regulation therefore, is that it assumes to convert what in the view of the statute is a question of fact requiring proof into a conclusive presumption which dispenses with proof and precludes dispute. 
    This is beyond administrative power. 
    We submit that the court below correctly set aside the numerical prescription provisions of these rules. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Warren E. Baker

    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Connelly's answer to various questions instigated by a question from Mr. Justice Harlan as to the nature of a hearing which would be required on a request for a waiver yesterday points out the basic difference between Storer and the Commission. 
    Mr. Connelly made it quite clear that the hearing that Storer is asking is a full hearing under Section 309 (b) in every case irrespective of the showing which might be made as to why the otherwise binding rule should not be applicable. 
    Now, this Section 309 (b) case hearing, is a hearing in which it is required that you have an evidentiary hearing with cross-examination before a hearing examiner with an initial decision or an opportunity to file exceptions and briefs to the Commission and a required oral argument and the final decision of the Commission and an opportunity to file a petition for reconsideration. 
    This is not just what is sometimes referred to as due process hearing which varies greatly with the circumstances of the particular case. 
    Now, we think it clear, that if this type of hearing can be secured upon the mere request by filing an application without setting forth any reasons as to why the rule should not be applied to a particular person, and irrespective of the showing he makes then the rules and any rule which is subject to such a requirement has no binding effect and has no practical value to an agency.

    May I ask you a question, I'm -- your argument confuses me a little. 
    Are you depending on the ground that the pleading is improper because they did not set out the facts? 
    Are you depending on the ground that the rule is valid?
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="2268.054" stopTime="2322.266">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    I'm starting out on the ground that the rule is valid and that the rule itself has a certain flexibility in it, just as did the Chain Broadcasting rules which permits a party to show if there are special considerations as to why the rule should not be applied to him. 
    Just as in the Chain Broadcasting regulations, the Commission has on the books a rule which permits an application -- I mean, a petition for waiver. 
    As we have stated in our reply brief, this is not of necessity mean that the kind of hearing which a party is entitled to upon a petition for waiver is the full evidentiary hearing set forth in Section 309 (b). 
    It is the kind of hearing, the kind of consideration which the pleadings themselves and the nature of the circumstances alleged justified.

    Yes. 
    That leads me to an illustration which we have not put in our brief, but I think it's quite pertinent. 
    First of all, we did not set forth the kinds of circumstances in which someone might obtain a waiver simply because at no time in this case has there ever been a request for a waiver. 
    Contrary to what Mr. Connelly said, the language in the decision dismissing his application which said, “We will treat the application as if it were for a waiver,” is with respect to a different rule entirely. 
    Had nothing to do with the question of whether or not it was an application to waive the multiple ownership rules.

    In such an event, it will be accepted and consideration will be given to the reasons relating to the waiver and a determination made there as to whether or not there are factual matters which need a factual hearing, whether or not, assuming all the facts they have submitted any reason which justifies finding that in this case an exception to the rule should be made.

    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    Well, when I say that -- when you say doesn't have to go to a hearing, we're talking about whether or not there are facts or disputes, whether or not, it could be resolved on a mere oral argument with respect to the legal questions or the policy questions and whether or not those determinations would be arbitrary abuse of discretion.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Consider that the Commission itself have -- have obtained revolved rules and thought that agreeing might be on this concentration, if that's the proper phrase and five rather seven, certainly, that's an argumentative area, are they not? 
    Maybe you want to show them in our case, five is not in the public interest.

    Mr. Warren E. Baker

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2917.158" stopTime="2917.511">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I should think --
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="2917.511" stopTime="2917.929">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2917.929" stopTime="2923.611">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- the nature of things, that's what the application means.
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="2923.611" stopTime="2952.139">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    I don't believe that the normal application is addressed to those things. 
    The normal application and its one which was filed here are addressed to the things which the Commission says, “You must meet also, such as what kind of programs do you intend to broadcast? 
    What other ownership do you have? 
    What do you intend to do with respect to network affiliation?” 
    And many of those facets and certainly are not directed to the question of whether or not, there are special circumstances in Miami or special circumstances with respect to Storer which justify a waiver of the rule.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2952.139" stopTime="2973.607">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Since they can -- since nobody can get an application granted unless they can mean the public interest. 
    And the man files an application, he presumably dependent on the issue that this isn't about the (Inaudible) 
    And therefore, he says, this isn't the public interest although you may have the general policy against more than five.
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="2973.607" stopTime="3006.070">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    That is an implied tender but certainly it needs more than an implied tender that this isn't the public interest to raise questions where you have adopted a rule which says, “This is not in the public interest.” 
    If this is a valid exercise of the legislative, the quasi legislative rule making power, a policy determination that we should not permit more than five except on unusual circumstances, certainly, someone is required to allege those unusual circumstances to justify the Commission waiving the rules.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3006.070" stopTime="3015.919">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Another clearer way to (Inaudible) Justice Black then, your position then is that the restriction complied here as though Congress had written it into the statute.
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3015.919" stopTime="3030.153">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    That is correct. 
    Except for the fact that it is because we have also the waiver provision, it is if Congress had written it in into the statute with the provision that in appropriate circumstances we could waive it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3030.153" stopTime="3038.001">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But Mr. Baker, what -- what circumstances can you conjure up which would have been entitled these people to a hearing?
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3038.001" stopTime="3109.473">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    Well, I can give you one right off, I believe, Chief Justice. 
    For example, if we take the horrible example of Mr. Connelly illustrates in which out in the Rocky Mountain area, there happens to be an assigned channel which no one has seen so far fit to apply them. 
    And a party who has the maximum comes in and said, “Here is a channel, here is a need for service and no one else wants it.” 
    And we, because we have multiple ownerships, can absorb what temporary losses there might be, justify your waiving the rule to give service to these people. 
    Under those circumstances, I think, the Commission might well consider that this was exceptional circumstance of justifying waiver. 
    But I submit that is not the fact here. 
    In no instance has the Commission had to turn down a request for more than the maximum in an area where they were not many well-qualified applicants seeking the facilities. 
    In the very case here, where did Storer apply for this six VHF. 
    In Miami, Florida, where there were seven applicants for the only two channels that were available and every one of them was well-qualified.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3109.473" stopTime="3118.841">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well now, that -- that isn't exactly what I want. 
    Would that one fact alleged be sufficient to waive the rule?
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3118.841" stopTime="3122.966">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    It might well be. 
    It would raise the question which the Commission would have to address itself to.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3122.966" stopTime="3126.649">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right. 
    Now, would he have a -- would he have a hearing on that?
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3126.649" stopTime="3138.127">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    If the Commission were to deny that the desirability of providing service to a place in which no else sought an -- sought to provide service, this --

    Yes.

    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    -- Court or another court might well say. 
    But that's an abuse of discretion not to have a hearing with respect to that matter. 
    But there are many factual questions which might also be involved. 
    That is whether or not other parties did seek one there because applications are in many stages of processing.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you one other question? 
    Now, what would you ask the Court to do if it -- if you ask to reverse this case? 
    What -- what is your (Inaudible) 
    What I meant -- I meant for this reason, if it -- if as I understand now, they can't -- could have been given if -- and the sole consequences between here as to whether they alleged to the (Inaudible)

speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3188.194" stopTime="3257.367">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    We would suggest that this Court find that the rule of law propounded by the court below is incorrect, which says that the Commission may not adopt a valid rule which without any specific allegation of reasons for waiver, does not provide a full hearing under Section 309 (b). 
    We also would suggest that because the court's opinion below infers that this is not a reasonable exercise of our discretion, that this is not a subject which is susceptible of being handled by rule, that you pass upon the question of whether or not, this subject of multiple ownership is an appropriate subject to be handled by rule making. 
    We see no reason why this Court should pass upon what circumstances would if a waiver had been requested, require a hearing. 
    We think that should be handled when appropriate circumstances are alleged and when those circumstances are found by the Commission in its discretion not to justify a hearing. 
    Under those circumstances, the courts below will pass upon whether or not there was an abuse of discretion.

    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    In this case, I think it really makes no difference what this Court does with respect to the particular application. 
    The failure of respondent to appeal a particular application when it was dismissed and the fact that those other competing applications for the specific channel were then processed and going through to a grant, which will take place in the near future, precludes there being any reliable of such an application.

    What?
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3520.837" stopTime="3558.083">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    -- that in the general application, a rule is applied but that, of course, if someone comes along and alleges there are special extraordinary circumstances which in this case are good cause for waiving the general rule, you may then waiver. 
    We don't think those things are inconsistent anymore that the rules of this Court or every other court on which have general rules as to respected dates of filing and other things and also contain provisions which say, “Upon good cause shown, the Court may waive the rules.” 
    This is a traditional concept of general rule with exceptional circumstances relating to waiver.

    That in -- in other words, will in any event if the words that are rather vague on each and will in any event (Inaudible) as though you're taking away the power to allow a waiver.
speaker="warren_e_baker" startTime="3572.978" stopTime="3590.172">
    Mr. Warren E. Baker 
    Well, I think that must be read with respect to the language before this which says, that in any case in which someone applies for more than the first station, the Commission will consider the question of undue concentration relating to certain factors. 
    But in any event when it reaches a certain maximum, the Commission will consider this as undue concentration.
