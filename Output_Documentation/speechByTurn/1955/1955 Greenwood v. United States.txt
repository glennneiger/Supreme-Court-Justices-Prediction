Greenwood v. United States
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="0.000" stopTime="117.023">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    If it please the Court, the second -- the contention of the United States here as I understand it is that the finding that this man will probably endanger the safety of the officers and property or other interests of the United States. 
    And the finding, the suitable arrangements are not available elsewhere for him supports the right of the United States to imprison him or whatever is said about his care or treatment, he is being imprisoned and he is imprisoned side by side with prisoners and as just as much of a prisoner as if he was convicted and had been convicted of -- of a crime. 
    And I think that it is important that we consider him as an innocent man as we must consider it. 
    Now, what about this first condition that he will probably endanger the safety of the officers, property or other interests of the United States. 
    That's the only finding that was made here, what are those other interests, what gives the United States the power to come and take a citizen and confine him perhaps permanently on -- on a finding that he probably will endanger some other interests of the United States. 
    Think -- think of the dangerousness of such a statute in spite of the good motives of the United States or the authorities, I think, we have here a statute that by its terminology is an extremely dangerous statute.

    Well, I -- I know in one state at least, the -- the finding the Court must make is to the effect that the person is so mentally deranged that he is dangerous either to himself or to others or to his own property or to other -- others' property.

    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    Well, I'll be frank. 
    I haven't made a study of state statutes except that I don't believe that this particular provision is as definite as the type of thing that which you have been referring. 
    To me, it's -- it's quite vague to say that someone will probably endanger, you don't have to find that he will endanger the officers of the United States or you don't have to find that he will endanger the -- the property, but even on a finding of some other interests without those other interest being defined, we can -- we can keep a man in prison and that's the point that I was trying to make.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Burrell, the -- the thing that concerns me here is the alternatives that are involved in this situation that isn't -- whether the Government will give this man a trial for his crime or release him because the Government would be willing and has shown his willingness to -- to give the man a trial and it's only because of his mental condition that he was prevented from doing so. 
    Now, what are the alternatives? 
    And let's -- let's put it in a little worst form than -- than this case is. 
    Assume this man is a dangerous criminal, but that -- the State that he comes from neither has the facilities nor the desire to hold him and protect society and there is this federal crime hanging over his head for which he has never been tried before, its -- the Government can't try him. 
    Must -- must the Government, if it does not hold him under this statute, release him upon the public at large so he can commit any kind of crimes that -- that might be addicted to?
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="643.655" stopTime="674.924">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    I -- I think that he must be released to the States that has jurisdiction over him, the State of his residence and I -- if in -- in your situation there, if the State after receiving him, I don't think we can -- if -- if they decide that its safe to let him go, I think that -- that we have to abide by that decision because the jurisdiction over this sick man is in the State.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="674.924" stopTime="697.951">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, may I -- may I pursue that just one-step farther. 
    Do you believe and do you contend here that he should have been released by the Federal Government at the time the Ohio authority said he was not insane? 
    Should they have turned him loose and let him go on society then?
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="697.951" stopTime="706.245">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    Well, I think perhaps it was -- it was proper to bring him back to find out if he was sane enough to stand a trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="706.245" stopTime="706.502">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="706.502" stopTime="716.101">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    But once finding out again that he -- he isn't able to stand trial, then I think he should under these circumstances be released.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="716.101" stopTime="724.409">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And you would have -- you would take that back to the -- to the time that the Ohio people determine he was sane?
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="724.409" stopTime="733.177">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    That's correct. 
    And after -- I -- I don't think it was necessarily wrong for the United States when Ohio released him to see if he could still stand trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="733.177" stopTime="733.366">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="733.366" stopTime="739.918">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    But once they found that he couldn't, then I think he should be -- he should be released under the circumstances back to Ohio.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="739.918" stopTime="741.537">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right.
speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="741.537" stopTime="901.970">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    Then, the -- what I -- I say here again may be repetitious, but we have this situation here on the facts that a man has been here in prison for three years. 
    He has been found unable to stand trial. 
    He was released back to the State, his home, the authorities that have jurisdiction over him. 
    And I think that even as the statute is worded, the United States being dissatisfied with action taken by Ohio has picked him up again and has him back in prison. 
    We're dealing with personal liberty, not just the question of the division of power between the United States and the States, but a serious question of personal liberty. 
    And I think that in this particular case that it is up to the States to determine the care and custody that should be given to this man and not up to the United States. 
    Now, I covert briefly in conclusion because of these two conditions that the Government contends give to the United States the power to restrain this man. 
    I would like to refer briefly to my final point that there was not substantial evidence to show that he was potentially dangerous to the Government. 
    The reason for referring to the evidence is that if this is the kind of evidence that allows, that comes within this statute, that it allows the United States to continue to imprison this man, then it is our position clearly that -- that this is not a proper and constitutional statute. 
    And referring to the record on page 68 and the report of the neuropsychiatric staff when the question of the conditions under 4247 came up as to whether they existed, the Board said that they agreed that the subject might be considered potentially dangerous to the extent that if released he might conceivably, might conceivably persist in criminal activities of the type of which he is presently charged. 
    In considering this man's mental illness, the Board find that he does not hold any fixed delusion concerning wanting to harm any person or group of persons either officials of the government or otherwise, so that in this respect, he probably would not constitute a danger to the safety of the officers, property or other interests of the United States.

    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    I think under the cases that if it is -- you're not precluded from doing so. 
    I -- we recognized the rule that it was -- it is rarely done. 
    The reason I'm particularly referring to this is that if this is the kind of evidence that the Government is talking about here that satisfies this statute, to me when he get down to the facts, we can see how the statute operates then it -- it shows, at least to me, the -- a force that lie in the -- in the statute.

    Mr. Burrell, assuming that the evidence is sufficient to support the finding, would you make any distinction between this case where the Court says that the prognosis is poor and that it -- it will -- it cannot be told with any definiteness if or when he was -- he could be tried from the case where the Court said, “We do not believe that he can be tried for one year or two years or three years.” 
    And then he based that on -- on medical -- kind of medical testimony.

speaker="william_j_burrell" startTime="1102.934" stopTime="1254.753">
    Mr. William J. Burrell 
    That is right, Your Honor. 
    I gave you the pages in the original transcript, its on page 24 and 30 of the -- of our record here. 
    And again referring to the evidence there that was before the Court of the hearing on July 30th and the testimony of Dr. Smith who was Chief of the Psychiatric Staff there at the Medical Center, their question is set out on page 29 of our brief, “What you do not find that he had any fixed delusions concerning wanting to harm any person or group of persons, officials of the government or otherwise.” 
    Answer - “No, Counselor, we did not and we pointed that out because -- and we found evidence of such delusions, if he had held fixed ideas that the government people wanted to hurt him or if he held ideas that he wanted to hurt the Government, either one might have been construed is making him potentially dangerous.” 
    And further testimony, “If he held the ideas that he wanted to harm the Government or its instrumentalities or perhaps even if we had been able to develop ideas that the Government wanted to harm him, we might have felt that there was an indication of potential dangerousness but we found neither.” 
    And then Dr. Smith further testified, “One of the factors which complicates this whole thing as it is,” this is on page 31 of the brief of petitioner, “that as you probably know the hospitals, everyday are releasing man of this type, that is they are turning them out on the streets presumably at least with responsible relatives, that sort of things, so that they are certainly many schizophrenics on the streets whose illness is of the same severity as the defendant here perhaps.” 
    So that there is a great pressure on their part apparently to turn those men loose to make room for men that they conceive as worse. 
    And as Judge Whittaker said in -- in a case there, the -- in -- in the United States District Court, it isn't a question of where the -- whether the facilities are perhaps better in the federal prison or whether the facilities are better as furnished by the States. 
    It's -- it's a question of a power to restrain this man's liberty. 
    And we respectfully submit that's on the record and the facts that he should be released to the authorities in the state of his residence for further care or custody as -- as the State sees that.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you, Mr Burrell. 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="1259.196" stopTime="1550.502">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Burrell has so fully and so fairly outlined the provisions of these statutes that I'll not take much time on them, unless there are some questions the Court wants to ask about them. 
    I think its -- it made perfectly clear. 
    But I like to say some general things about the statute and then go to the main point in this case, the only real point that's before the Court, the constitutional question that he is raising, because I don't think that the fact problem that he raises is -- is one that will appeal to the Court as requiring any reversal, the two courts having made their finding. 
    Now, I don't suppose that any statute has ever been brought before this Court for adjudication that has a more distinguished paternity than this statute. 
    As Your Honors know, it's the product of very careful study that lasted from 1942 to 1949 by distinguished Committee of federal judges appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States because of the recognition of the existing problem. 
    The Chairman of that Committee was Judge Magruder of First Circuit, members of that Committee were Judge Hincks in Second Circuit. 
    He was a district judge. 
    Judge Learned Hand was a member of the Committee. 
    The file show that these distinguished men didn't accept something that was done for them. 
    This is not a ghostwritten statute. 
    It was done by the best legal and judicial brains in the nation and done deliberately and whatever might be speculated about whether a cabinet officer had somebody presenting something, then he signs without really concentrating on it. 
    Certainly, these men who corresponded at length and thought deeply about this thing acted with deliberation and then they worked also in cooperation with the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, Mr. Bennett, and the doctors and the administrators of the Prison Bureau and of the Mental Hospitals of the United States, Dr. Overholser, and other doctors. 
    That was a hearing which is recorded. 
    You have a testimony. 
    You gather from that that this has been very well considered and not only in its administrative aspects but also the constitutional question. 
    Now, prior to 1942 and the reason for the appointment of the Committee, the different judges, district judges were finding that many men were coming before them who really ought not to be brought before them because of their mental condition. 
    The prison authorities were receiving men convicted who really ought never had been put on trial. 
    And these officials were driven to going through these irregular, unjust, illegal gestures because there was no particular -- there was no alternative. 
    At least it was deemed necessary to establish an orderly procedure that would set out those cases that were obviously unfit for trial. 
    One section of this law provides a procedure to deal with that and other section is to pick up any mistakes so that if the question was not raised perhaps because the man did not have proper counsel or any counsel and it's found shortly after his admission to the prison that he's really insane. 
    There is an orderly procedure for raising the question in determining whether he had really had due process. 
    And then the question arose what ought to be the order of commitment. 
    As originally drawn, the statute simply said that in that case if a man is found after hearing to be insane, he should be committed.

speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="1553.606" stopTime="2080.225">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    -- of our brief. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Section 4246, whenever the trial court shall determine in accordance with Sections 4244 and 4245 of this title that an accused is or was mentally incompetent, the Court may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative. 
    That's where the original draft stopped. 
    And then you can see it as -- in a moving picture, the development of this thing and the correspondence of the members of the Committee, until the -- the question was raised, well, what do you do in the case of a man who may not be tried shortly. 
    How are you going to raise the commitment then? 
    So it was proposed, then this language was added. 
    It shall be -- he's authorized to be committed to the Attorney General until, at the last three lines of that page, until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law. 
    They felt to make it constitutional. 
    They have to put that limitation on. 
    Then our attention was further directed to the problem of what do you do with cases where a man may not be tried for a very long time, where it's indefinite -- indefinite duration of the arrangement. 
    Do you treat him the same way? 
    Here is a practical problem. 
    You can't just dump the man on the street to commit further depredations, yet, there ought to be some greater safeguard in a case like that because he's being committed for an indefinite time. 
    So they added this language, the second -- the second sentence of this Section 4246, which appears on the top of page 62, and this is the new language. 
    And if the Court after hearing as provided in the preceding Sections 4244 and 4245 shall determine that the conditions specified in the following Section 4247 exists, the commitment shall be governed by 4248. 
    Now, what are the conditions in 4247? 
    The conditions in 4247, you see on page 63, that is whenever a person, I'm looking at Section 4248, the -- I'll read from the beginning, whenever a person shall be committed pursuant to Section -- let me first read 4247 on page 62, “Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to expire.” 
    Now, you notice originally they were thinking only of the man who has served his time and they recognized that he's a menace if left at large and they wanted to know what to do about him. 
    But by the addition of the five or six lines in the preceding section, they made these conditions, which are outlined in 4247, apply also to the man who was not yet been tried because of his mental condition. 
    And what are the conditions? 
    If it is found by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that this man who -- whose sentence is about to expire or the man who has been committed and he can't yet be tried under the other section, that he is insane or mentally incompetent. 
    Two, that if released, he will probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property or other interests of the United States. 
    And three, that suitable arrangements for the custody and care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, then the Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to the Court and the Court shall cause the prisoner to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist. 
    And then the reports of the psychiatrists are filed to the Court and then there's a hearing and not -- and there must be due notice and he must have the benefit of counsel and the report of the psychiatrist is made available and any other testimony is made available on behalf of the man or on behalf of the Government that will bear on the issue. 
    Then, if he is found to be insane and if these other two conditions are present, they believe that he is a probable danger to some interests of the United States or its property or its officers. 
    And other suitable arrangements are unavailable. 
    If those three conditions are present, then he is committed under 4248 which appears on page 63 and you'll see that the duration of the commitment is hedged. 
    First, you can -- you keep him until the -- whichever event shall first occur of these three that until his mental condition is so improved that if released he will not endanger the safety of officers, property or other interests of the United States or until suitable arrangements had been made for the custody and care of the prisoner, either his sanity has restored or he's sufficiently improved does -- no longer to be in danger or you have an alternative, a State is willing to take him. 
    Now, that was done and in the judgment of these members of the Committee that met all constitutional requirements even in the case of the man who is indefinitely ill and has to be detained indefinitely. 
    Of course, he always has the right to test out the question as to whether he's sufficiently improved to be discharged. 
    He -- he could raise that on habeas corpus. 
    The statute recognizes that even if the statute didn't, of course, habeas corpus would be available to him. 
    Not only was this draft passed on by the members of the Committee but it was circulated at the instance of the conference, the Judicial Conference of the United States among all the circuit and district judges of a country, 20 to 30 of them wrote in and making this -- that suggestion, all these things were carefully and deliberately considered. 
    And the final draft is what wasn't enacted by Congress. 
    Now, I'd like to come to the -- first, the -- the question as to whether the statute means what we say it means. 
    The judges in the Tenth Circuit and in the Ninth Circuit having before them cases unlike this and that those people were not found to be dangerous, there was no -- there was no attempt to make such a finding. 
    They have the ordinary case. 
    There has been no definite finding of dangerousness. 
    There has been no enquiry into the availability of alternative. 
    So it is -- and the only section of -- the only portion of 4246 that was complied with was the first sentence that didn't have these safeguards. 
    It was on that kind of a case that the Ninth and the Tenth Circuit said, “We do not read the statute as covering the case of one in -- an indefinite duration of insanity. 
    To do so -- to read it so would be -- would raise great constitutional questions. 
    In one case, the judge said, “I think the man ought to be discharged because the statute so read would be unconstitutional.” 
    In other words, in the case of a person who was not found dangerous and not -- and there was no showing that there was no alternative facilities, they said, it was not enough for the Government to act. 
    You have here the first reported case. 
    There have been six commitments under the statute, but you have the first reported case here, where there was an attempt and, I think with -- on -- on sufficient basis to declare whether or not there -- this man was dangerous and whether or not there was alternative facilities. 
    He was found on the testimony of the doctors to be a danger and he was -- it was also found as it's amply proven in the -- by experience in this case that Ohio wouldn't take him and there was no other place for him to go.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2080.225" stopTime="2088.627">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do I understand that -- that you're arguing that the constitutional power may depend on whether he is dangerous or not?
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="2088.627" stopTime="2128.752">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    I think that if he -- were not a danger. 
    The Government would have less latitude in dealing with him. 
    There is a greater responsibility on the Government not to discharge a man who has shown a disposition to commit particular depredations and who in the judgment of the doctors is liable to repeat that conduct. 
    Then, there is in a case of a man who may be insane in the sense that he cannot properly cooperate with his lawyer in the defense and yet, it is agreed that he's harmless. 
    In that case, you can't just --

    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    -- which is no more -- no longer duration than the -- a case of measles or something or some other illness that the man had. 
    But, of course, there's very little basis for any question of the -- of the Government's power to deal with it. 
    The question that they are raising is, what do you do in a case where the duration of this illness is indefinite.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2194.542" stopTime="2204.084">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, what does indefinite mean, if you don't know when it will come to an end or that there's practically no likelihood that it never will come to an end which (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="2204.084" stopTime="2340.147">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    Either or indefinite. 
    I'll -- I'll answer it this way. 
    Dr. Overholser provided the answer to the question that Mr. Justice Reed asked here about the categories of -- of mental illness as to whether there are temporary and permanent or whether there are other categories. 
    Dr. Overholser said, “It's impossible to say in most cases whether a condition is permanent.” 
    There's been a great deal of progress in -- in medical science in recent years. 
    Some wonderful drugs have been discovered and used in the last two or three years, procedures that were undreamed off only a few years ago are now available and helpful in many cases. 
    So that a distinguished psychiatrist as Overholser says, that it's impossible to say in many cases whether or not a condition is permanent. 
    And yet, you may have a case of such gravity that you feel this man may not be available for trial for a long time. 
    This statute hedges the jurisdiction of the United States well within the limits by praying a proper deference to the State and saying if there is, in a case of uncertain duration, long duration and uncertain, a possibility of the State taking him. 
    We're not contesting with the State. 
    This is not an instance of competing jurisdictions. 
    These are two jurisdictions that are -- one of them is holding off and refusing to act. 
    This Court has upheld many acts in support of the commerce power for instance and in other instances where you have the Federal Government impinging on what would normally be state action. 
    And the question arises as to how far in this competition between jurisdictions, where do you find the balance. 
    You don't have that problem here. 
    You have here Congress saying, in any case where the man cannot be tried and he is committed, the commitment shall have this limitation in it that if there is available, a State that is willing to take him surrendering.

    I will say that there may come a time, as Judge Magruder said in his testimony before the Senate, it's conceivable that in a particular case there may come a time when under the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial, you can't delay it any longer. 
    For instance, what this Court did in the (Inaudible) case recently. 
    You concluded that the passage of, I think it was 10 or 11 years, and -- and to prove in the absence of certain witnesses made it impracticable to conduct a trial, you affirmed the dismissal of the indictment. 
    A court could always, in a proper case, do that. 
    You don't have such a problem here. 
    I can imagine problems of that sort arising in extreme cases. 
    You don't have any such thing here. 
    You have here a finding that the man is not presently triable, that his prognosis is bad. 
    Nobody says that he'll -- he will never be tried. 
    This very case, the man has had remissions. 
    He turns around and he's better and then turns around he's worst, and who has the wisdom and the foresight to know. 
    The doctors don't know and I don't think that the courts are called on to speculate abstractedly about a situation that's -- that's not before you. 
    What you have here now is a man to derange to stand trial. 
    He has twice held up post offices by -- in armed robberies. 
    This is not a sneak -- sneak thief who has come in and just picked up roller stamps. 
    He has threatened with a gun the post office clerk. 
    He has done that twice. 
    Even the doctors, upon who we don't particularly rely, agree that the likelihood is that he would repeat that conduct. 
    He has no specific hostility to the president or to the postmaster general and maybe not even to that post office clerk, but he goes about his business and the business like way with a gun. 
    Now, you don't have to have a specific hostility. 
    He is still a menace. 
    He is still a danger.

    We would -- we would keep him. 
    Now -- and wouldn't be an absurd result to say that a sovereignty that has a right to enact criminal laws and to make arrests of violators and to take them into detention, finding that it can't proceed with a trial and yet has the man on his hands, as Judge Magruder says, we have a bear by the tail.

    It's possible that the State later would take him, if so, that would change the situations, possible that the man may have a remission and would -- would no longer be dangerous, you'd have a different case, but this condition continues. 
    What must a sovereignty like the United States do?

    No, sir. 
    Now, I'll tell you why, Your Honor. 
    The problem of an orderly disposition of this man might still be a valid reason for further detention. 
    For this reason, the fact that you're no longer going to try him because you're now processing the case, it doesn't terminate the problem of the Government which has this man in its custody. 
    And Congress isn't precluded from making a sensible it and reasonable and I say just a moral decision that he shall not be dumped and set at large to commit further depredations against the United States, against himself, against the general public. 
    It certainly is within the competence of the United States to do that.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="2794.620" stopTime="2796.696">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    In fact, you have a statute to that effect, don't you?
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="2796.696" stopTime="2849.682">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    That -- that is the statute here. 
    That is the statute. 
    Your Honors will recall the language that I think was used by the Court of the Hoke case, the case in which the Court upheld the validity of the Mann Act and the problem constitutionally was not unlike this. 
    It was a question of how far the Federal Government can enter into what is normally a subject of state regulation pertaining to the morals, good order and I think it was Mr Justice Johnson who said and I forgot who the justice is.

speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="2851.170" stopTime="3033.130">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    “Our dual form of government has its perplexities, State and nation having different spheres of jurisdiction, as we have said, but it must be kept in mind that we are one people and the powers reserved to the States and those conferred on the nation are adopted to the exercise whether independently or concurrently to promote the general welfare, material and moral.” 
    Now, I don't derive a greater power from the general welfare clause, but I think that clause is instructive as to how to -- to view these several grants and try to find a -- a rational integration where possible and not say that the United States is driven to doing what in the judgment of these judges who had practical experience with the problem and the judgment of Congress is the only reasonable and fair and safe thing to do. 
    Now, as has been indicated here, I think that the criminal power of the Government raises as a necessary corollary the right to make provision for the disposition of men who come lawfully into the custody of the United States or violating its laws and that would be sufficient and certainly sufficient in this case. 
    But in addition to that, there are other provisions of the Constitution which lend some support. 
    Judge Huxman said, in his Tenth Circuit dissent, he said that common principles of humanity require the Government having the insane person in its custody not to abandon him without some suitable provision preferably by surrendering him to the State, but when the State will not take him, then in some other manner. 
    Now, there are many familiar examples of the Government dealing with respect to people that have a special relation to it in a manner that it could not deal with him if they were just members of the general public. 
    If this were a case, and I think hypothetically, this case was put by a member of the Court by Mr. Burrell, if this were a case, where Ohio fails to make a disposition of an insane person within its borders and the Government said, “Well, if Ohio won't do it, we'll do it.” 
    I think we'd all unhesitatingly answer, that's Ohio's business and not the business of the United States. 
    But if the United States has a special relation to this man, he is coming to its lawful custody or a violation of the law.

    I thought it was safe to release him and we are not taking the position. 
    We think that that's sufficient if that's the proper finding, if that's the Court, the probate court there that have the right to make that finding. 
    And I don't think as Justice Frankfurter has said that we have any right to assume that the States are unmindful of their responsibilities in their care of the -- of the sick and of the insane. 
    And I think there is a second point that I would -- would like to make and that is the -- the question of whether or not the charges against him are dismissed under his commitment and under the provisions of it, it makes no difference whether the charges remain pending or not.
