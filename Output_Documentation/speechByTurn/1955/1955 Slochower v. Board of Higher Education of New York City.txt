Slochower v. Board of Higher Education of New York City

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 23, On the docket, Harry Slochower versus The Board of Higher Education of the City of New York. 
    Mr. London.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="13.636" stopTime="158.952">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    The Court will recall that Dr. Slochower was being questioned by the Senate Subcommittee when the Court recess -- yesterday afternoon that he had testified that he was not a member of the Communist Party, that he had not been a member of the Communist Party for the years after 1941 and refused on the grounds that his answer might tend to incriminate him to state whether he was a member in 1940 or in 1941. 
    Dr. Slochower stated further that he had expressed himself, I believe, publically in opposition to some communist doctrines. 
    Two weeks after the hearing, Dr. Slochower received a notice from the Board of Higher Education which governs the college in which he work that by resolution he was dismissed. 
    He had been working for the city system as an instructor and a college professor, I assume 27 years. 
    He had tenure by statute. 
    I think counsel for the appellee will concede that had Dr.Slochower been guilty of any other wrong doing, he would have been entitled to notice. 
    Had he perjured himself to use a specific instance given by the corporation counsel? 
    Had he contumaciously refuse to answer questions? 
    Had he been guilty of arson, seducing a student or stealing money from the college, he would have been entitled to a hearing before he could be discharged. 
    But once he invoked the constitutional right, he lost his right to a hearing. 
    He lost his right to notice. 
    He lost all of the rights guaranteed him by the statute and the elaborate procedures that have been formulated for discharge of professors by the Board of Higher Education. 
    I shall return to that question later, the question of procedural due process.

    As a matter of fact, Your Honor, the Equal Protection of the Laws Clause was invoked at the very outset. 
    It's in the petition and I think I can call your attention to the -- to the precise section. 
    I believe at page, it says that the petitioner was deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment that have been the -- the argument --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="710.458" stopTime="712.786">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did you raise the question of bill of attainment?
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="712.786" stopTime="1021.086">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We have raised that too. 
    Now, with respect to the statutes offense against the Privileges and Immunities Clause the Section provides for the dismissal of an employee, a state employee or city employee rather who invokes the constitutional right against self-incrimination. 
    I don't believe the word constitutional is in Section 903 but anyone who invokes the right to refuse to incriminate himself is under the statute to be discharged. 
    Before this Section was enacted in 1938, the New York constitution read exactly as the federal constitutional provision with respect to self-incrimination. 
    The exact language as, Your Honors are familiar is, "Nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." 
    That was the New York statute before 1938. 
    Now, in 1938 -- that was the New York constitution, I'm sorry. 
    In 1938, the New York constitution was amended to validate such a law as Section 903. 
    The New York constitution now provides, that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, providing that any public officer upon being called before a grand jury, refuses to answer any relevant questions.I'm just reading the relevant portion. 
    Relevant question concerning his office should be removed from office by the appropriate authority and shall forfeit his office at the suit of the Attorney General. 
    Now, without that change in the New York constitution, Section 903 would have been unconstitutional under the laws of the -- under the constitution of the State of New York. 
    I think that as the Court of Appeals has held, one who invokes the state constitutional right may properly be discharged under Section 903. 
    But the amendment of the state constitution can certainly not affect the federal constitutional right and it was the federal constitutional right that was invoked in this case. 
    I think there can be no question about it. 
    It was specifically referred to in the hearings as the Fifth Amendment right and it was before a federal body, a Senate Subcommittee, the Committee on the judiciary. 
    So, there can be no question but that it was a federal right, in a federal proceeding that was here invoked and because of the invocation of that right, the appellant, Slochower was discharged. 
    Now, the argument has been made that Section 903 doesn't really inhibit the right against self -- self-incrimination that just imposes a condition on public employment. 
    I think the argument is a spacious one. 
    I think that merely because the Section does not say we forbid public employees to invoke the Fifth Amendment that it doesn't have that effect. 
    It obviously, does have that effect because it is followed by a penal consequence namely, discharge. 
    Now, I think, I'll call your attention of the fact in -- in my brief that most of the penal laws of the State of New York and I believe the same is true with the federal laws, do not forbid any particular act. 
    They provide that an act shall be punished in a particular manner, the fact that that is merely the provision -- that the provision is merely want for punishment doesn't mean that the State doesn't forbid the act. 
    And so, in this case the State of New York in effect forbids its employees to invoke the Fifth Amendment on paying of discharge from their positions. 
    I think there's also a line of cases to which I have called the attention to the effect that a State cannot impose an unconstitutional condition on a privilege that it is granting the unconstitutional condition in this case, being the condition that one must surrender his constitutional right against self-incrimination.

    What's your (Inaudible)
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="1037.565" stopTime="1128.400">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    I think not, Your Honor. 
    I think that the -- the section between the case that we have and the case where a federal employee might be discharged for invoking the Fifth Amendment, is very great because in our case, the case that we have now, a state employee is in effect being told that he may not invoke certain rights in a purely federal proceeding in a matter over which the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction. 
    It think that the regulation is in effect an invasion on the sphere reserve for -- for federal action. 
    The distinction, I believe, Your Honor was made in -- in the Mitchell case in that case the -- the question was raised as to whether or not a federal employee in being denied the right to engage in certain political activities was being deprived of state right. 
    And the Court found, I believe it's on page 96 of the opinion that the state rights were not being violated. 
    And so, in this case, I think, you will have a different question of purely state right was being affected by Section 903, as it is a federal right was being affected and I think the distinction is important.

    That is now the meaning of the statute as the -- as construed by the highest court of New York and we must accept that as the meaning of the statute. 
    But in answer to Justice Reed's question I -- I like to emphasize that no one has accused Dr. Slochower of any wrong doing. 
    It hasn't been suggested that he is a member of the Communist Party. 
    It isn't suggested that he has -- is incompetent. 
    It isn't suggested that he isn't fit for his job, on the contrary, I think, he has been recognized as the one of the most competent and eminent members of the -- of the school staff.

    I -- I mentioned yesterday in answer to Justice Harlan's question, the argument that was raised by corporation counsel in opposition to the motion for remittitur which was as follows and I read now from page 5 of the appellee's brief in the Court of Appeals. 
    It's apparent from the forgoing discussion that if this Court finds that a question of federal constitutionality was properly presented, the alternative relief of reargument sought by a petitioner is unnecessary and his argument was that there was no point if this questions have been properly presented and passed upon by the Court, in the Court's amending the remittitur or granting reargument in that respect and, I think, the corporation counsel was entirely right. 
    I think the Court had passed on the question.

    Why did you ask for remittitur, is it your claim in the decision?

    Mr. Ephraim London 
    I -- I stated yesterday that -- that I -- I thought that the motion for remittitur -- for the amendment of a remittitur was ill advised. 
    I'm more convinced to it now, Your Honor. 
    [Laughter] 
    Now, in considering the -- the question of -- of whether the statute under consideration violates Article 6 of the Constitution and violates the -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    The question of reasonableness does not enter into the discussion whether or not the law is a wise one, whether or not the law is a reasonable one, if it invades an area reserved to the Federal Government or if it violates or abridges a privilege granted by the Constitution then the law must fall whether reasonable or no. 
    In the -- in our argument relating to the violation of the Due Process Clause, we must answer the question of reasonableness because this, it is claimed that the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is arbitrary and it is unreasonable. 
    And it is arbitrary and it is unreasonable because it limits a federal constitutional right and it's claimed, the appellant submits that that right had nothing whatever to do with his fitness for employment or with his right to work for the public school system. 
    Now, the appellee has argued that the invocation of the right is a matter relating to a teacher's employment because there's something dishonorable or indecent about refusing to answer question on the grounds of self-incrimination. 
    To use the precise argument that the Board has used in this Court, they say that either the invocation of the right tends to show that a man is guilty or that the one who invokes the right is a perjurer. 
    In either case, he is immediately branded and stamped as being guilty of wrong doing the moment he invokes his federal constitutional right. 
    Now, this Court has repeatedly asserted that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is one of the Board's freedom that it's a privilege of great value, “The Chief Justice's opinion in the Quinn case.” 
    This privilege of great value would be worth nothing if the moment one invokes it, he is immediately assumed to be guilty of the crime about which his questioned or he's assumed to be perjurer or one or the other. 
    It would virtually nullify the act completely, both nullify the amendment completely. 
    And if I can use a -- a much abused and misused term, I think, that that argument is subversive of the Constitution because it eliminates the provision completely. 
    One wouldn't dare to exercise the constitutional right if these were the inferences to be drawn.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    The purpose for which he raised the Fifth Amendment before the Court of Appeal -- well actually he did raise it at all.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2204.267" stopTime="2204.533">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then why --
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="2204.533" stopTime="2345.209">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    The only argument he made in the Court of Appeals was that it deprived him of the due process to which he was entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment because he had no trial, because he had no hearing. 
    He didn't have compensation of witnesses. 
    He didn't have the right to cross-examine. 
    That's his whole argument in the Court of Appeals. 
    As a matter of fact, in the Appellate Division, a citation in the opinion of that Court in which he relies. 
    In the Appellate Division, he made no reference to any federal right or any constitutional right so that when he states in his reply brief, at page -- referring to page 50 of the record that the charter provision does not abridge the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. 
    What the Appellate Division is referring to there, is this argument made by the appellant. 
    I read from this point heading, point two, Section 903 of the New York Charter is an unconstitutional abridgement of rights guaranteed by Article 1, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution. 
    The Section is void and have no effect and it cannot be held to sanction the appellants dismissal. 
    That's what the Appellate Division was talking about at page 50 of the record, when it said that they found no conflict between Section 903 and the New York State Constitution. 
    Similarly, he refers the Court to page 56 of the Court of Appeals opinion, contain that the -- page 56 in the record where all the Court of Appeals was doing was paraphrasing what the opinion of the Appellate Division was. 
    And it stated there that the Appellate Division found that there was no abridgement of the constitutional right referring to the New York State Constitution.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2345.209" stopTime="2369.885">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But Mr. Scannell if -- if the Fifth Amendment was not raised before the Court of Appeals. 
    What would have led Judge Desmond in his dissenting opinion to say, “All sides conceive that aside from the suppose applicability of Section 903, the teachers could not be deprived to their position for exercising their Fifth Amendment Right.”
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="2369.885" stopTime="2448.775">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    What Judge Desmond meant there Mr. Chief Justice, is that if 903 weren't on the statute books of New York State, this teacher could not be dismissed because if you will see he refers to matter of Gray. 
    In the Gray case, it involved a lawyer in Staten Island who was accused of (Inaudible) chasing and he was asked to execute a waiver of immunity before going before the Court. 
    And he stated I will exercise such a waiver, but when I go before the Court, I'll make full disclosure about all my books etcetera. 
    But he refused to sign the waiver. 
    He was brought up for purposes of disbarment to determine whether he was contemptuous of the Court and the Court of Appeals said that he was protected by the New York State Constitution and he may invoke the privilege. 
    So that all Judge Desmond was talking about, is that in view of that Gray decision, if there was not an act by the legislature such as Section 903, this teacher could not be dismissed for invoking the Fifth Amendment. 
    That's all Judge Desmond was talking about.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2448.775" stopTime="2464.164">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, it just seems to me though that unless someone had raised the Fifth Amendment right, there wouldn't be any occasion for him to conclude that all sides concede that except for that, there would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, Your Honor, I've gone through the Appellate Division of the Court of Appeals brief of this appellant from one page, from the front page to the back. 
    And the only reference that I find to any federal question is when he argues that the appellant, Slochower, was deprived of property rights without due process in violation of Article 1, Section 10 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
    The clear import of the argument is the Fourteenth Amendment as far as the due process part is concerned.

    And therefore, we have to consider acquisitions in view of what the Court of Appeals says they did (Inaudible)

    If the language was absolutely clear, there would be no question that your position is correct, well it's correct anyhow. 
    But when there is some doubt in you mind as to what the Court of Appeals sent to you for review. 
    I think it is pertinent to understand what the Court of Appeals had before it.

    Makes it all look an impossible job. 
    (Inaudible) submitted in the Court of Appeals in the Appellate Division, Supreme Court and to check all arguments to see whether every argument is (Inaudible) below although, it was the same language, the one the Court of Appeals certified, the argument needs to be open.
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="2749.509" stopTime="2974.982">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, I think the answer to that might have been if the petitioner has gone back to the Court of Appeals and ask them to rephrase the question if they would as he now puts it. 
    Your Honor, I was -- Mr. Chief Justice, I was sorry for the reply brief yesterday and certain points were raised in the reply brief, which I have answered orally but I would like permission to submit an explanation to his reply brief. 
    I could have it by next Monday, I think. 
    The Section we have here under examination namely, 903 of the New York City Charter has for its purpose the assurance that employees of the City of New York will give their full cooperation to any properly constituted investigating committee that makes inquiry either to the affairs or Government of the City of New York or inquiry into the official conduct of one of the employees of the City of New York. 
    Now, the purpose in providing that no employee called to testify under those circumstances and in answer to questions along that line. 
    The purpose in precluding him from continuing as an employee and pleading self-incrimination seems to me rather obvious. 
    If the employee point-blankly refuses to testify, he is of course subject to contempt action by the investigating body, as well as dismissal by the employee -- employer. 
    Similarly, if he testifies falsely, he could be prosecuted for perjury. 
    But when the employee invokes the Fifth Amendment, he is effectively (Inaudible) that committee. 
    The committee can go no further with that witness. 
    Now, when the inquiry is to the employees official conduct it seems to me is under an obligation to make complete and frank disclosure. 
    The same obligation he would have if he will call before the Board of Higher Education and ask the question. 
    Now, in addition, the state legislature undoubtedly have in mind that certain inferences flow from the invoking of the privilege against self-incrimination. 
    We do not say that there's a clear inference of guilt. 
    What we do say is that under the law as interpreted by this Court that for the witness to invoke the Fifth Amendment, he must sincerely believe that his answer will tend to forge a link and a chain of evidence which may lead to his conviction for a crime. 
    If he invoke to for any other reason he is invoking it improperly and he has invoking it perjuriously.

    But I do not argue that it is an irrevocable conclusion that he is guilty.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    I believe that a plea of -- the plea could be consistent with innocence but I do say that you can't shut off the inferences which ordinarily must flow. 
    The ordinary obligation of any citizen is to come forward and give full and complete testimony. 
    But the framers of the Constitution in order to protect the people against a -- the practice of torture that existed in the old English law setup an artificial protection, but it doesn't mean that when the protection is invoked that no inferences flow there from, that's especially true when the employee is call before a body that has a right to know, when the employee is called upon to a conference conduct and he then retreats behind the Fifth Amendment for the privilege against self-incrimination.

    Well this statute -- this statute says -- says, any legislative committee doesn't say just to State of New York or the State of -- or the Government of United States, but supposed this man went over into New Jersey.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, the Court of Appeals in this case, of course, was dealing only with a Senate Committee and there are many areas where the Government has an interest in the operation of the city.

    No. 
    Let's don't take that. 
    Let's just take him as a citizen over in that citizen of New York, over in New Jersey for some business or profession purpose. 
    Suppose there's a group of educators met over in New Jersey. 
    I suppose petitioner attended that convention. 
    Suppose he made a speech and suppose a legislative committee immediately subpoenaed him and ask him the same questions and he gave the same answers. 
    Do you think that would be grounds for immediate dismissal and barring for the rest of his life from service in the City of New York under this charter section?

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, of course, the Court of Appeals doesn't pass on that. 
    But taking your facts as they are, if he did certain acts in New Jersey which would justify being called before a legislative committee in New Jersey and the questions that were asked concerning those acts had a direct bearing on his fitness as a teacher, I would say that, in my own opinion, that it probably would apply.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I -- what I'm trying to find is and I think your law was good and maybe it's better to meet for what it is, that you're saying that because of this particular constitutional privilege for a men to invoke it, shows that he is a bad citizen.
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="3732.949" stopTime="3739.945">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, I'm saying that as a -- a secondary result that flows. 
    My argument has two prongs to it.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3739.945" stopTime="3740.930">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What's the other prong?
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="3740.930" stopTime="3744.485">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    One is that his got an obligation to cooperate and he may not be --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That Federal Constitution says, has told him that he his under no obligation to cooperate in that way by incriminating himself. 
    That's what the Federal Constitution said, doesn't it? 
    And its about (Inaudible) isn't it?
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="3759.012" stopTime="3760.768">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    I would say so, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3760.768" stopTime="3766.233">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, isn't that what it says, that he is under no duty to cooperate and giving evidence against himself?
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="3766.233" stopTime="3781.241">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Yes. 
    But you have two parallel things existing. 
    You have the right of the individual on the one hand and the right of his employer on the other hand. 
    Now, they're both existing side by side, the employer has certain rights and the employee has certain rights.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3781.241" stopTime="3791.335">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, what constitutional provision says that an employer has a -- has a right to discharge his employee because he claim the Fifth Amendment?
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="3791.335" stopTime="3840.495">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, I would say that this Court has held in many instances that the constitutional privileges are not absolute rights. 
    For instance, in the Prince against Massachusetts case which involved the child who was selling religious pamphlets in Massachusetts and the child was under the age of 12. 
    The parent was arrested or the child was taken into custody, I don't recall which. 
    Now, the argument was -- they made there that that child was an ordained minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses and that child was exercising his religious freedom which is given to him under the Constitution, which I think is greater right than the right against self-incrimination. 
    Yet this Court sustained the right of the State to move in there to protect the child's welfare. 
    Similarly, I think the employee --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3840.495" stopTime="3866.905">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did it -- did it sustain the State's right to do something to him because he claimed that privilege and keep for the Constitution. 
    Has there even been -- has there ever been a decision by this Court that sustain a state law which did something to person in a way of injury to it because he invoked the privilege which he is allowed to invoke under the Federal Constitution?

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell

    It said the -- well, I think it can hardly be denied that -- like (Inaudible) 
    He had a constitutional right to cross-politics but he has no constitutional right to be a (Inaudible). 
    I don't see how you can object to that. 
    There's no doubt they'll say. 
    There are few employments behind so this does not agree to suspend these constitutional rights (Inaudible) relevant argument by the implied (Inaudible) contract. 
    On the same principle, the city may impose any reasonable condition upon holding off his immediate control.”

    So that we can consider whether in the circumstances of this case, the precise refusal that was made, when it was made, the time it was made and as the subject matter that was made.

    All the questions that were about asked. 
    And in the precise setting of this case, this is a reasonable condition.

    To me it makes a lot difference whether a question is put in answering to refuse by Senator Ferguson in relation to the subject matter that he was charged with inquiry and said he was inquiring. 
    And the city authority themselves, the education authority of the city putting a question, it was their teaching that they deem relevant. 
    It's the only thing that concerns the educational authority, namely, the (Inaudible) of a teacher.

    He merely said, he wouldn't answer whether he was a member of a Communist Party in 1941. 
    And this Court had solemnly decided that in 1941 it wasn't, as a matter of law, subversive to belong to the Communist Party.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Scannell, let me ask you this question. 
    Suppose that Dr. Slochower, instead of having been with the school board for 27 years was a young man, too young to have been a teacher even in 1941. 
    Suppose he went to work for the school board in 1952 and the same question was asked to him, it was asked in this case and he claimed his -- his privilege as he did. 
    Would you say that -- that the sanctions of 903 could be applied to him?
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="4429.026" stopTime="4479.775">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    I think that the Court would have to determine whether a membership back in 1941 would have a relationship to his official conduct of 1952. 
    I think it may very well be a proper question though because Mr. Chief Justice, you got to pick a starting point in all these inquiries. 
    And the person, I think this is true when New York, has nothing to fear by being frank. 
    There are a number of teachers who have admitted past Communist Party membership who are teaching in the New York City school system today. 
    The problem is where the person undertakes to cut you off an inquiry and cut you off from the information which you feel you have a right to have. 
    That's the problem.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    But, Mr. Scannell, if 903 applies and if as the Court of Appeals says, that his dismissal is automatic. 
    How could this young man that I mentioned ever get to show that the -- his conduct in 1941, ten years before he is old enough to be a teacher did not have any relation to his professional conduct. 
    And as I understand he is automatically ousted from his position by reason of his claim of the privilege.
speaker="daniel_t_scannell" startTime="4515.618" stopTime="4540.579">
    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    Well, there are certain elements which must be established, Your Honor. 
    If he went into Court and he raised the issue that the question did not have a relationship to his official conduct, he would have a full judicial review on that question and if the Court determined it did not then Section 903 would not be operative.

    Mr. Daniel T. Scannell 
    I think he urged it as part of his due process argument. 
    Now, of course what happen there was that the Board of Higher Educations got an official transcript of his testimony and they determined that he had invoked the privilege and they asked the corporation counsel, also in opinion as to whether the Board of Higher Education was within the contemplation of that Section and the answer was yes.

    He is the only person who knows what that link maybe.

    Now, I think his employer has a right to know and that it's inconsistent to say, “I want to cloak myself in the constitutional protection and at the same time, I want to preclude you from Mr. Employer from knowing what this Act was.”

    So that what you're doing here is indirect, the same as though you have passed the law which stated, “That any man who belong to this Communist Party in 1941 when it was legal and who refused to admit it should be barred from holding a job for the State for the rest of his life.”

   Rebuttal of Ephraim London
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5857.942" stopTime="5860.697">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. London.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5860.697" stopTime="5914.881">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    The Court please. 
    I'd like to correct the statement by my friend Mr. Scannell with reference to the Garner case and I think it's rather crucial. 
    He was of the opinion that the Garner case permitted questioning with respect to any prior period. 
    As a matter of fact, that case related to a statute which provided that the -- the employees of the City would have to swear that within five years prior to the effect of date of the law, they have not advise or advocated the overthrow of the Government. 
    It was limited to the five-year period. 
    Now, that inquiry was held relevant because of a charter provision that had been passed some seven years before, which made that inquiry, an appropriate inquiry in connection with Government office. 
    So that the Garner case didn't really relate --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5914.881" stopTime="5922.812">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Scannell is right in saying, the affidavit is -- it wasn't limited for five-year period.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5922.812" stopTime="5925.201">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    I -- I beg to differ with, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5925.201" stopTime="5930.142">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, is just a question of reading (Inaudible) all we have to do is to read.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5930.142" stopTime="5938.725">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    I believe that it says within five years prior to the effective date of the law. 
    I maybe mistaken, but I believe that's correct and I believe that this Court specifically --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5943.722" stopTime="5954.924">

    That supposed to be (Inaudible)
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5957.521" stopTime="5957.839">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5957.839" stopTime="5965.994">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a different question to Mr. Scannell. 
    One is the question of an oath of -- and that's the five-year period.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5965.994" stopTime="5966.699">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5966.699" stopTime="5971.782">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then there was an affidavit as you now (Inaudible)
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="5971.782" stopTime="6223.983">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Yes. 
    In addition -- in addition in the Garner case, in connection with the -- in connection with the statement. 
    It was assumed by the Court that the statement had to be -- that the -- the statement meant that one with knowledge had advocated the overthrow of the Government or has belong to an organization which had advocated the overthrow of the Government. 
    In so it was the material and most important factor as the Court later noted in the Wieman case. 
    Now, there is another tremendously important difference between the Garner case and this one. 
    And that the Garner case related to a state inquiry with respect to a state matter pursuant to a State Charter Amendment. 
    I think the difference between that case and the case at bar is probably most dramatically illustrated by a companion case to the Garner case, the Durand case. 
    Now, before the Durand case came up there had been a prior action. 
    There were several people in the State of Maryland including Thelma Durand who were running for office. 
    The State of Maryland required that those people state under oath that all people running for office state under oath that they have not been members of organization which where deemed subversive, something to that effect. 
    Now, Thelma Durand and the first of the cases, was running for Federal Government Office, I believe for Congress. 
    The State of Maryland held that that statute did not apply to her but applied to the other defendants or rather the other petitioners, I'm sorry, who were running for state office alone because have that application been made in connection with federal office it would have been an invasion of the federal sphere of action or an area reserved for the federal domination. 
    Later when the Durand case came up before this Court, the second Durand case, it was case where Thelma Durand was then running for state office and the Court held that she could, that -- that the State of Maryland could pass regulations controlling state office. 
    So here, we have statute which interferes with a federal proceeding or with the Government of federal proceedings. 
    And therefore, in that connection the question of reasonableness does not enter but I want to answer my friend's argument with respect to the reasonableness of the statute. 
    In considering its reasonableness, we may consider several factors (1) the purpose of the statute, (2) the alternative methods and (3) the application to the particular case. 
    Now, with respect to purpose, my friend says it is to compel cooperation with inquiry relating to office. 
    Well now, the -- the State Government is certainly not without power to compel cooperation, it doesn't need -- this means, namely the deprivation or the limitation of the constitutional right against self-incrimination in point of fact, there have been several later cases where teachers declined to answer whether they were members of the Communist Party and they were removed by the State of New York not because of the violation of Section 903 but after hearings, in which it was determined that they had failed to cooperate. 
    I think that the -- the best answer to the argument of the appellee has made is Justice Roberts in the Schneider case in which he said, “That if one wants to prevent littering in the streets, it's not necessary to limit the right of public assembly to merely pass a law preventing the littering or forbidding or punishing the littering of the streets.” 
    In this case, if they want to root out communist in the public school system, they have a perfect means of doing so. 
    As a matter of fact, they found that means in the Feinberg law which this Court upheld.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, with respect to the -- to the application of this particular case, I think, the Court has emphasized in its questions, the fact that this relates to a period some 12 or 13 years prior to the inquiry. 
    It couldn't possibly have any -- any connection with the teacher's confidence or ability to teach and there was no claim at any time that this question related to his own confidence and fitness as a teacher.
