    Number 13 Original, State of Wisconsin versus the State of Tennessee. 
    Attorney General Thomson.
speaker="vernon_w_thomson" startTime="37.053" stopTime="371.380">
    Mr. Vernon W. Thomson 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a motion by the State of Wisconsin for leave to file a complaint in an original action against the State of Tennessee. 
    The motion proposed complaint and brief were served upon the proper officials in the State of Tennessee. 
    The Governor and the Attorney General of that State on the 14th, of October 1955. 
    No answer or other pleading has been served by the State of Tennessee except a brief, which was served and filed and which we construe in the nature of a demurrer to our proposed complaint. 
    We believe the jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by Article 3 Section 2, Clause 2 because it is an action in which one of the sovereign states is a party. 
    In this action, both parties are sovereign states and we believe that Section 1251 (a) of Title 28 of the United States Code gives exclusive jurisdiction of this proposed action to this honorable body. 
    The principal question involved in this proposed action is, does a Tennessee statute which allows residence of a marketing area in Tennessee to sell milk and milk products below a prevailing price without restriction, but subjects the residence of a -- of the State of Wisconsin to a thread of prosecution if they make sales below said prevailing price constitute a direct and undue burden upon interstate commerce? 
    It is our position that it does. 
    We believe that it is discriminatory against interstate commerce and hence violative of the Commerce Clause, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, and also violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, Article 14, Section 1. 
    The controversy arose as a result of the passage in the State of Tennessee of Public Law 74 of 1955. 
    In this Act, it provides in substance that any person who shall sell milk or milk products in any marketing area for a less than the wholesale or retail price at the place of sale, when such milk has been prepared or processed for resale and transported into the marketing area from any point outside of the marketing area has committed a proscribed act. 
    A shortened quotation from paragraph A of Public Act 74 describes the unlawful act as follows" To sell within any marketing area at wholesale or retail for less than the prevailing wholesale or retail price at the place of sale any of the following named products, market milk. 
    And then they enumerate all various kinds of fluid milk, butter milk and cream that have been prepared or processed for resale and have been transported in the said marketing area from any point outside of said marketing area". 
    Anyone violating the provisions of Public Law 74 will be subjected to penalties up to $300 or by imprisonment not to exceed three months or by both, such imprisonment and fine. 
    It is the position of the State of Wisconsin that this law, the mere passage of this law creates a barrier to the free flow of milk from the State of Wisconsin into the State of Tennessee. 
    And additional prescription in this Act permits an injunctional proceeding by the Commissioner of Agriculture. 
    So, with the passage of this Act, the milk producers in Wisconsin are faced with injunction and prosecution if they transport milk into the State of Tennessee and attempt to sell it competitively in that State. 
    This --

    Are there any relief for such a milk producer of Wisconsin?
speaker="vernon_w_thomson" startTime="376.714" stopTime="384.529">
    Mr. Vernon W. Thomson 
    Apparently, there is no relief except to comply with the law or engage in the expensive litigation in that particular jurisdiction.

    Is it filed into the Commerce Clause, it would (Inaudible) that in light of this not to be in the penalty.

    Mr. Vernon W. Thomson 
    Mr. Justice, that is why we are in this Court. 
    This is a matter of great importance, this free interstate commerce in milk to the State of Wisconsin and to the thousands of milk producers in the State of Wisconsin. 
    The second greatest industry in Wisconsin is the dairy industry. 
    We produce tremendous quantities of milk in the State of Wisconsin. 
    Prior to the passage of this law, substantial quantities of milk produced have been sold in the State of Tennessee. 
    In the State of Wisconsin, there are 107,000 farm families engaged in the production of milk, and in 1954, the State of Wisconsin produced 16.5 billion pounds of milk. 
    In addition to that, we exported from the State of Wisconsin more than 1 billion pounds of milk. 
    This industry is vital to the State of Wisconsin. 
    The export of this milk, we have a tremendous reservoir of milk available to the people of America if we are not prevented by a maze of discriminatory statutes and regulations and barriers from moving it freely in interstate commerce. 
    Those 107,000 farm families in Wisconsin have more than 2,600,000 producing dairy cattle and more than 4 million cattle on their farms. 
    The value of this milk exceeds $500 million. 
    And the total volume of butter fat in addition to that milk shipped in interstate commerce out of the State of Wisconsin in 1954 exceeded 28.5 million pounds. 
    So, this industry is vital to the State of Wisconsin and the free flow of this milk is essential to prevent the depression of dairy prices in our state if this milk is not permitted to move freely. 
    And now we're faced --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Attorney General, there are great many trade barriers that reflect in the same way against states, would you think that the any trade barrier could be the subject of an original suit here as between the states?

    Possibly not any trade barrier, I can conceive of some that would not. 
    But we think that this is a barrier, a real barrier and a direct barrier against the free flow of milk between our State and the State of Tennessee. 
    We have pleaded these ultimate facts and none of them have been denied by the State of Tennessee. 
    And we believe that these facts bring into our operation the rules of law laid down by this Court in the decision in Pennsylvania versus West Virginia. 
    One significant part of that case was the fact that Pennsylvania started suit only eight days after the passage of the law in West Virginia, and this Court entertained that suit against the -- we cited to show that this action was brought timely because this Court has entertained these actions when they were brought before any injury has been done and the Court said that the injured State did not need to wait until injury had been done but when the statute was clearly beyond the power of the State that this Court would step in and provide a remedy. 
    And we also think that that doctrine is set forth in the case of Georgia versus the Pennsylvania Railroad which as we understand that case, accepted jurisdiction on the theory of parens patriae and not on the theory that the State of Georgia had a particularly or real proprietary interest.

    We also think that the doctrine must -- is repeated in the Dean Milk Company case versus the City of Madison, wherein Madison had an ordinance that required pasteurization of that milk within a radius of 25 miles of the City of Madison, and this Court held that it was discriminatory against interstate commerce and that it -- even though it discriminated against some of the people residing in the jurisdiction, that it was an undue burden on interstate commerce, and therefore, it was struck down. 
    A similar rule was ruling in the case of Hood versus Du Mond which we think supports our position of -- that this burden in this particular case is a direct burden on interstate commerce and it is outside of the power of the state to regulate and thus discriminate against the people of the State of Wisconsin. 
    They have further burden placed on interstate commerce in this Act, which requires that the milk must be sold in Tennessee at not less than cost. 
    And then, they described cost as the cost to the producer in the State of Tennessee. 
    It is our contention, and if we have the opportunity to present this matter to this Court that we can more efficiently produce that milk and that it -- that their cost factor is a direct burden on interstate commerce. 
    So, we have this --

   Argument of Attorney General
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1663.940" stopTime="1666.612">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. (Inaudible)
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="1666.612" stopTime="2064.373">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    May it please the Court. 
    We don't think that jurisdiction of this Court to entertain suits between states rest upon the effect that an individual suit might have on the pocket book of some citizen of one of the states. 
    It's our position first of all that the State of Wisconsin under the allegations of this complaint has not stated a cause which properly invokes the original jurisdiction of this Court. 
    Secondly, that the state of facts in Wisconsin's proposed complaint justified this Court in exercising its discretion in the matter in refusing to take jurisdiction. 
    And thirdly, that the statute is not unconstitutional. 
    Now, getting to a number of questions that have been raised from the bench with regard to the rights of a private or individual producer in the State of Wisconsin to institute such an action, it's our position that there is nothing in the world to prevent a producer in the State of Wisconsin if the facts are such that bring him within the terms of the Act from coming into the State of Tennessee and sue in there either in the state courts or in the District Court of the United States, or if an action is brought against them in the state court, he can resist on the grounds of the invalidity of this statute. 
    As a matter of fact, a suit to test the statute wherein it is alleged that the Act is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause is now pending in the United States District Court in Nashville. 
    The pleadings and the orders in that case as set out in the brief that there is a private litigant who is in Court who's fighting just as hard as he can to get the same kind of relief that Wisconsin is trying to get by the exercise of original jurisdiction in this Court. 
    And the matter is now pending, waiting for it to be set before a three-judge court. 
    Now, this matter is of primary importance for this reason. 
    It's well known (Inaudible) only those who are affected by the statute can question its constitutionality. 
    Now, as an example of what I'm talking about with particular reference to the situation that we have before us, suppose the state passes an Act taxing the sale of automobile tires and suppose I as a merchant go in and allege that I am a merchant that I don't like the statute and I want it stricken down. 
    Well, I think I would have to go on and allege that I was engaged in the sale of automobile tires before acted -- get the Court to pass on the validity of the statute. 
    Now, we say that that's exactly the position that the State of Wisconsin is in here. 
    Wisconsin said we have a dairy industry. 
    We've got so many cows and we produce so much milk. 
    But the only allegation in this proposed complaint that comes anywhere near a showing that Wisconsin people and Wisconsin producers will be in any way affected by this Act is the allegation that huge quantities of milk produced in Wisconsin have been sold in Tennessee. 
    Now the statute forbids certain marketing practices if done with intent to injure or destroy competition. 
    It forbids the sale of milk that had been transported into a marketing area at less than the prevailing wholesale or retail prices place of sale. 
    Marketing areas are defined as being counties that have within their borders municipalities which have ordinance is regulating the grading of milk. 
    There is no allegation in this proposed complaint to any Wisconsin producer. 
    Transports milk into any marketing area in the State of Tennessee. 
    There is no allegation in this proposed complaint that any Wisconsin producer has sold milk transported in such a marketing area so as to violate the terms of this Act. 
    Furthermore, there is no allegation that any Wisconsin producer has any desire to do anything that could possibly be construed as a violation of this Act. 
    Now, the point I'm making is this. 
    And it was set up by this Court in the case of United Public Workers against Mitchell. 
    Unless there is a real controversy, neither this Court nor any other Court has jurisdiction to entertain a lawsuit. 
    Now, in that case, the complainants went even further than Wisconsin has gone here because they alleged that they wanted to engage in certain political activity. 
    They wanted to be poll workers and they wanted to go out and solicit for various candidates and all those things were forbidden by the Hatch Act and they said for that reason, it's unconstitutional. 
    But this Court held that they should have been repelled in the lower court and the suit was finally entertained as to only one complainant who had actually done something that violated the Act. 
    Now that brings us down to this proposition, before any suit, in any court should be entertained to test the validity of this Act, the complainant in the suit should be required to show that he has an interest in the matter. 
    He has an interest that is adversely affected by the Act. 
    That is a matter that can be threshed out in the District Court. 
    That is a matter that can be threshed out in the state court between some individual producer in the State of Tennessee or some competitor. 
    All those matters can be determined. 
    A searching inquiry can be gone into, to find out whether or not the Act affects him and whether or not he's entitled to maintain it.

    Mr. Attorney General 
    We say first you have none and secondly it should not be exercised if the Court has it. 
    It's further the insistence of the State of Tennessee that this statute is not invalid. 
    The primary complaint about it in the proposed pleading is that it is a direct and undue burden on interstate commerce. 
    The terms of the statute primarily provide that it shall be unlawful to sell that below prevailing wholesale or retail price at the place of sale, milk that has been produced for resale and transported into a marketing area. 
    This applies not only to milk that is transported across state lines but also intrastate. 
    Therefore, we insist that there is no discrimination against interstate commerce.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2523.918" stopTime="2529.275">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does it apply for local -- local producers and distributors also?
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="2529.275" stopTime="2532.858">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    Not with respect to that particular provision of the statute.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2532.858" stopTime="2557.638">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, how do you -- how do you avoid that discrimination? 
    Isn't that a discrimination that permits local producers and processors to -- to sell at any price but to charge interstate producers to require them to charge a higher price to take it out of the realm of competition?
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="2557.638" stopTime="2576.434">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    It might be if they were permitted to charge in the price. 
    But while that particular provision of the Act does not affect them, there is another provision of the Act that applies to everybody whether the milk has been transported in or not, which prohibits its sale less than -- at less than cost to the seller.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2576.434" stopTime="2577.736">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I -- I understood the Attorney General of Wisconsin to say that the cost -- the minimum cost was to be fixed by the cost of doing business by the local producers and distributors. 
    I don't know whether I heard him correct that you are not in that -- but that's what I -- I understood him to say.
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="2612.686" stopTime="2615.436">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    I think that's his contention about the matter but --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2615.436" stopTime="2616.559">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That is not the fact?
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="2616.559" stopTime="2681.973">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    That's not as we see it, no, sir. 
    The Act provides this. 
    That no milk where there imported into a marketing area or not shall be sold at less than cost to the seller. 
    That provision goes on to state that proof of cost to other sellers in the marketing area shall constitute prima facie evidence of cost to the seller against him, any action might be taken. 
    Now, it might be said that cost to the seller is fixed.

    Mr. Attorney General 
    If it please Your Honor, we think the cases of Baldwin against Seelig and hood against Du Mond do not support the position of the State of Wisconsin in this case. 
    There, there was an unequivocal barrier to the flow of milk in interstate commerce which does not exist here. 
    On the question of whether this statute is valid or invalid under the Commerce Clause of the constitution, we rely upon the cases of Eisenberg -- Milk Control Board against Eisenberg Farm Products wherein this Court approved the action of a Milk Control Board of a state in setting prices of milk that was -- prices that was to be paid to producers of milk in the state even though milk was to flow in interstate commerce. 
    The same result was reached in the case of City Service Gas Company against Peerless Oil &amp; Gas Company wherein there this Court upheld the action of the State of Oklahoma in fixing prices for gas that was to be taken from a certain field even though that gas was to be transported in interstate commerce. 
    Those cases went even further than the statute in the case at bar because there, there was a definite price fixing arrangement where the State of Oklahoma on one hand and the State of New York on the other hand said, "This shall be paid for Oil &amp; Gas and this shall be paid for milk in no less." 
    There's a statement in City Service against Peerless Oil that we think is directly applicable to the situation at bar. 
    This Court said that it's not every incidental effect on the interstate commerce that will strike down a state statute that the states have a right to enact certain police regulations even though they might have some incidental impact on interstate commerce. 
    The requirements are that interstate commerce not be discriminated against we think that test has been made here that there is no undue burden on it. 
    We think that so far as the pleadings here go, there is no showing of undue burden. 
    There's nothing on the face of -- of the statute itself to indicate that an undue burden will be placed on it. 
    And furthermore, we think that if the safeguards and obvious state interest over which the national interest if there be any and the prevention of all regulation does not prohibit. 
    It's therefore our insistence that Wisconsin has no right to maintain a suit that even if the Court has jurisdiction, its discretion should be exercised against the filing of this complaint and that lastly, the statute is not invalid.

   Rebuttal of Vernon W. Thomson
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4174.188" stopTime="4186.694">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Attorney General, did you -- you had a very few moments left if you wish to use them.
speaker="vernon_w_thomson" startTime="4186.694" stopTime="4332.094">
    Mr. Vernon W. Thomson 
    May it please the Court. 
    Counsel for Tennessee apparently isn't aware of the fact if the Director of Agriculture of the State of Tennessee has placed him a mail and sent to the processors of milk, shipping milk into the State of Tennessee a copy of Public Law 74 which we are here discussing without comment what the processor felt the clear implication of that notice was that the State of Tennessee did intend to enforce the law against people who attempted to deliver milk into the State of Tennessee. 
    It was our position in our plea for right to file a complaint here that speed is one of the reasons -- expeditious relief is one of the reasons for granting a litigant the right to come in parens patriae and represent their people. 
    And particularly in view of the large number of people in the state and the impact on the economy of the state the delay would affect the Dean Milk Company did begin litigating with the State of Tennessee in April of 1955. 
    And that case is still in the District Court of the State of Tennessee and there's no reason for us to believe but what if the Dean Milk Company can find markets elsewhere that they will withdraw from their attempt to go into the State of Tennessee and abandon their lawsuit in the State of Tennessee. 
    The processor in this particular type of industry stands between the producer and the ultimate consumer and his interest may not coincide with the interest of the producer in getting his milk into the hands of consumers. 
    And therefore, we feel that it is vital that the matter be considered in this Court and not make us depend. 
    Not make all of the producers in the State of Wisconsin depend on the interest of some producer to take action in the State of Tennessee to litigate that question.

    The State of Tennessee has threatened enforcement. 
    We feel that it is discriminatory both by requiring us to sell at the prevailing market price and there's no definition of what it is and also requiring us to sell at not below cost which is a cost determined by the producers in the State of Tennessee which may be entirely different from the efficient production cost that can be obtain in the State of Wisconsin. 
    And we feel and we will brief this but we had relied on Title 28 Section 1251 which says, paragraph A, "The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more states."
