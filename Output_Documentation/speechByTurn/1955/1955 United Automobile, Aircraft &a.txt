    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    May it please the Court. 
    The judgment which is challenged in this case proscribes mass picketing, violence, traffic obstructions and related activities. 
    As I understood counsel in his argument yesterday, the authority of the State to regulate those activities, I believe, I quote correctly when I say "to regulate and punish those activities is not questioned." 
    As I understood the questioning, I believe counsel said that they did not question the State's authority either to enter injunctions proscribing such conduct in equity proceedings on the application of private parties but they do question the State's authority to do the regulation in the manner in which it was done in this case. 
    I think therefore it may be more helpful if I start out on a practical approach to the problem Wisconsin and the attempts Wisconsin has made to solve the problem. 
    I -- I think that there's no question that if a State has authority to preserve the peace and to regulate the type of conduct that is here involved, it has a correlative duty unless one has been a law enforcement officer on the scene of a mass labor dispute with all the bitterness, the hostility, the potential explosiveness to others, he can't possibly realize the problem that it is involved, but he -- they can realize that it is no privilege to do such regulation, it's a duty. 
    We are not here because we're power hungry. 
    We're here because we've been faced with the demand of our citizens to control this difficult situation. 
    It's not something that we would like to do if anybody else is willing to. 
    Anybody -- any agency which is able and willing to control the situation is more than welcome. 
    But up to date, there has been no agency but ourselves and we have met with the unpleasant resentment of -- from one side if we do and from resentment from the other side if we don't. 
    But the problem is there. 
    So we have tried to meet it and this is how we have done it. 
    We feel that in these localities, where feelings are run -- running extremely high as they always do in small communities where there is a labor dispute, that we must have a method that is far enough removed from the disputants themselves to be impartial.At the same time, we must have a close enough and flexible enough to move rapidly. 
    Wisconsin, I think both legislatively and administratively, has made an honest effort to meet that situation without encroaching upon the area which we believe this Court says Congress has intended should be preempted. 
    The legislative plan has been devised in an attempt to find something more expeditious and flexible than mere punishment and putting in jail of individuals and also to meet that situation of impartiality in the particular dispute. 
    It combines some of the elements of -- of criminal statutes, some of the elements of equity injunction procedure but with the more objectionable element of both omitted and with a more expeditious and effective procedure, we believe, substituted. 
    Instead of the general proscription of say mass picketing by a criminal law applicable throughout the entire State, Wisconsin has said that we will appoint a body to conduct a full hearing and -- and then devise and define those proscriptions according to the particular circumstances. 
    So that everybody may know exactly what is put here but in -- in a particular case instead of having to take the chance of deciding for himself whether two or five or ten people in an area does involve and constitute mass picketing. 
    Now, this -- this is akin to the formulation of a statutory definition of -- which might be found in a criminal law. 
    It does not involve in the first instance any penalty at all. 
    This is -- it follows a full hearing and which both sides are entitled to present anything they feel is pertinent. 
    They -- the full hearing was held by the State Labor Board in this case and it found there have been assaults, injury to property, mass picketing, of arrests, obstruction of entrance or egress, violence of various types. 
    Now, it is -- it was suggested in the reply brief of the appellant, I believe, that it is not conceded that these things occur. 
    However, the appellant did not elect to print any evidence. 
    We are before the Court on basis of the findings and since what is prohibited by the judgment is the same type of conduct which was found to have occurred. 
    Presumably, there would be no reason for being here if they had not occurred. 
    In any event, the kind of conduct described in the findings of the Board is all that is prohibited. 
    So that if it did not occur and if it is not anticipated by the appellants that they want to engage in it in the future, certainly, nobody has been prejudiced. 
    Now, the second step in the legislative plan is a full court review. 
    The Board's order carries no penalty neither does it mean anything until it has been enforced by a court of law. 
    The enforcement is strictly, of course, on review. 
    There's no more evidence but the enforcement procedure guarantees the right of all parties to have the legal issues heard and have the Court to determine whether the Board acted properly within its authority and legally. 
    The Court in this case, it has been suggested, was not satisfied with the order but felt itself bound by rules of law. 
    I think, perhaps, counsel drew inferences from the statement quoted in the brief that are not warranted. 
    I think there's no question that the Court sitting in review felt that it would like to get out, get its hands on the said dispute and settle it if it could. 
    It would like, of course, as any appellate court would to -- to solve the whole problem right then and there. 
    So, the Court was talking about the fact that it had certain restrictions because it was sitting in review only but there was no question in the Courts' mind. 
    And I -- I think I will read a bit of the -- just a bit of the Court's decision that the subject matter proscribed was perfectly, properly prohibited. 
    The Court said it would seem most unreasonable and illogical if any court should hold that a state court of record would be impotent to restrain the Commission of acts that are in themselves illegal per se. 
    There is no inherent right on the part of individual members of the union or the union as an organization or its officers in directing it to engage in mass picketing. 
    There is no inherent right on the part of any of your -- members of unions to intimidate, to threaten, to assault or to unlawfully interfere with the liberties of any person. 
    So, it would seem to me that the complaint is groundless when it is exerted on the proposition that those types of actions should not be restrained. 
    Now, that's all we're doing in the court below. 
    None of the courts had any question in their mind if what the Board had done was proper, of course, the Court as well as the Board would have like to go farther and settle the labor dispute. 
    But the very fact that we restrained ourselves to the portion of the area which is properly within our jurisdiction should not be a point of criticism. 
    It should be rather, I think, a recognition that we have tried to -- to assume our proper share in the governmental scheme and no more. 
    Now, it was suggested, I think at this point it might be well to -- to take up the discussion that was held yesterday on the fact that -- that counsel apparently concedes that it would be proper for a state court to issue an injunction against this identical conduct if it had been applied for by a private party and issued under general rules of equity. 
    I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that Wisconsin Supreme Court has said that the State Board has discretion to grant or withhold a remedy on equitable principles fully as much as could be done under the older common law injunction cases. 
    I did not cite the case in my brief, and I will cite it for the benefit of the Court, Appleton Chair Corporation versus United Brotherhood, 239, Wis.337, 1 N.W.2d 188 in which there was wrongful conduct shown before the Board on the part of both an employer and a labor organization. 
    The Board, the State Board, issued a remedy solely against the employer. 
    The employer complained that that was not proper, that it had been shown that the labor organization too was guilty of unfair labor practices. 
    Nonetheless, the Supreme Court said that the statute contemplated that the Board should weigh the conduct of the adverse parties and should give what remedy at peace it deemed just to the private rights and necessary for the public protection. 
    And it is not true in any event in most states, at least, including Wisconsin that an injunction can be obtained in connection with a labor dispute irrespective of statutes defining the labor policy of the State. 
    Wisconsin has, as most states, has its -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act which prescribes principles under the labor policy of the State which we strict the issuance of injunctions in connection with labor disputes irrespective of who the moving party is. 
    All right, now, that is the second step to --

    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    Of course -- one of the -- the objections -- some of the objections to the labor injunction suit, of course, is the courts are too busy that they -- they -- it takes a long time for them to get around to a trial of the facts. 
    There has been a tendency to issue ex parte injunctions because the courts didn't have time to -- to try the cases solely to -- those were reasons why Wisconsin felt we will establish a labor board that is always supposed to be ready at a moments notice to take care of an emergency.

    How speedily does this procedure operate? 
    How speedily does it operate in this case?
speaker="beatrice_lampert" startTime="832.277" stopTime="922.262">
    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    It was about a little over a month from this case, although it has operated much more rapidly in some others. 
    I think the testimony in this case was exceedingly long, it ran through many, many pages which is probably why it -- it wasn't printed here. 
    The hearings themselves took days and days but the order of the Board was out in a little over a month from the time the complaint was filed. 
    If I may say, I think hereto, it was suggested in argument that the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin commented that by the time the case got to it, the questions relating to employer conduct were not pertinent and the reason it said so, why is because the appellants did not chose to bring them in issue in this case. 
    As I have demonstrated by -- the case I have quite quoted to the Court, the Appleton Chair case, any conduct amounting to an unfair practice could have been alleged as a counter complaint and could have been considered by the Board if appellant said he'd like you to do so but if they -- they preferred to take it to some other agency, obviously there's nothing that the State can do to any excess of its jurisdiction and it should not be criticized for not deciding something that was not brought before it.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="957.655" stopTime="966.457">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But this -- could an injunction -- could avail for an injunction that have been filed in this case to restrain alleged violent conduct?
speaker="beatrice_lampert" startTime="966.457" stopTime="1836.317">
    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    I believe it could. 
    I think I might say that one of the reasons perhaps why it was not is -- I will go into a little later. 
    The two general reasons why the people ordinarily go to our administrative agency is that it is faster and that it is a little farther away from the scenes. 
    You would have to apply for your -- to -- for your injunction in a local court. 
    Very frequently, their court -- the judges have some interest that impels them to disqualify themselves and it is sometimes slow, particularly if we have to get in an outside judge.But that procedure is still available if one elects to pursue it. 
    Now, then up to that stage, we've had two proceedings and we've had a proceeding before the Board and proceeding before the Court to tell people what is proper conduct not impinging upon the public interest in this case and there has been no penalty or no possibility of penalty and that isn't such a case as this. 
    The third step before we can have any penalty or at least in practice before we have had any penalty involves a civil contempt proceeding. 
    That is a full court, full desk court proceeding, with the Board restricted by exactly the same rules that apply to any other -- a hold or other judgment in a civil action. 
    It must file its pleadings which must be verified affidavits. 
    It must give notice. 
    There must be a full trial before a court record, only then, if the Court finds that after these previous two steps have been taken, can anybody be penalized. 
    At least in practice, that is the way in which all these cases which we have cited in our briefs have come to the courts and up to this Court. 
    Under our civil contempt statutes, aside from the payment of damages to injured parties, the limit, the absolute outside limit of any penalty which could be imposed for violation of this judgment is $250 in fine or six months in jail. 
    And I assure you, we do not exercise even that small sanction indiscriminately. 
    For many, many years, I am the only counsel the State Board has had. 
    It develops upon me to conduct these contempt proceedings and they are arduous, we don't do them except as a last resort. 
    So there have been very few people actually penalized under this procedure. 
    The idea is to let them know what they can and cannot do and a great majority of people want to do what they should when they know. 
    So that is the procedure upon we -- which we have come up here. 
    Now, the factual background, I think it's a little bit important in determining why we can't just simply rely on arrests and imprisonment. 
    This dispute occurred in a village of less than 2000 population. 
    Many of the employees of the company involved come from other communities so that the number of striking employees exceeded the total population of the village. 
    They were aided by affiliates and of persons assigned to assist from other places and by sympathizers in the area. 
    So that the number of persons engaged in mass picketing exceeded the total number of residents in the village -- I mean exceeded in engaging in picketing activities. 
    I think it can be taken as common knowledge that in a village of that size, there is not more than a handful of policemen who are not trained for mob control. 
    Their average duty will probably be at the most making an arrest of a single citizen at a time for -- I don't -- bringing -- (Inaudible) at a neighbor's guard. 
    They -- I expected them under the criminal procedure to go out among these 2000 people and put in enough people and arrest them and go start the wheels of the criminal procedure running to keep the matter under control. 
    Well, not only, even if they could do that, there are still further difficulties. 
    A small community involves almost always, at least a dozen in Wisconsin certainly elected enforcement officials including prosecuting attorneys and judges. 
    In that community, where a large dispute of this nature is going on, everybody has an opinion, everybody is concerned. 
    Drawing a jury which has no opinion on an unsolved case, for instance, would take weeks. 
    A prosecuting attorney who is too zealous may be unable to finish his cases because an election intervenes. 
    A judge and that is a matter of record in this case that the judge, even the one who had to hear the Board's petition for enforcement which was solely reviewed, disqualified himself because he had been criticized before sitting on an assault case, when he had stock in a grocery store or interested in a grocery store where some of the strikers were trading. 
    Those things make it a practical problem in most communities to try to control by this criminal procedure which goes on for months and months and months when the courts are crowded. 
    If we had 2000 people participating and tried them each individually and do a criminal process, the strike would long, long, long be over before anybody would be brought to test. 
    The -- and I have -- I have, I think, explained why the -- the State has offered this additional method into the common law method of injunction on basis of the private party. 
    I think, possibly, this is one of the cases in which the administrative procedure before the Board was simply for the private party than finding a judge who would be willing to sit in a private injunction suit. 
    Now, secondly, that -- that is the legislative process which has tried to find a practical solution to what it deems to be of duty not of privilege. 
    Secondly, the Board has made an honest effort in this case to abstain from the area which it understands that from the decisions of this Court have been preempted. 
    As -- we will show and I'm bringing -- about to show, I think, now that there is actually no duplication of any function which can be exercised by the National Labor Relations Board. 
    But I -- I -- in doing so, I don't want to be understood as indicating that the action would be improper if there were duplication. 
    The legislative records we have quoted have said expressly that in these extreme cases and surely, violence is an extreme case, then there's no objection that there is duplication. 
    Counsel did suggest in his -- in its reply brief that there is, and I quote, “A dearth of references to state labor laws except in connection with 10 (a) and 14 (b)." 
    Well, now, we could have quoted many more than we did but we quoted at least four in our brief. 
    One appears on page 8 which -- in which Representative Kristen of Wisconsin questioned Mr. Hartley and said, “Now, does this law -- and this was not in connection with 10 (a) or 14 (b), said, "Does this law leave as much as it's possible to States?" 
    Leave it to them to settle disputes at the state level and -- and Kristen -- and he spoke expressly of the Wisconsin law, the very law that is here before the Court. 
    And Mr. Taft and Mr. Hartley said, “Yes, that's the intention of this law, the law as a whole.” 
    On page 8 -- or on page 10, Mr. -- I think it was Senator Ball who made reference to the Allis-Chalmers strike as being one of the types of things that -- where there was state control. 
    The activities in the Allis-Chalmers strike have -- it was a year or two before that were very, very similar to this case excepting on a greater scale. 
    And Senator Ball told the Congress at that time that those things that were -- were controlled by state law and by state law he could have meant only the law that was involved in the Allis-Chalmers case which came to this Court on petition for certiorari and which certiorari was denied, the identical law. 
    And he referred -- it is suggested that when he referred to peace officers, he wasn't referring to labor boards but to a larger extent. 
    I, counsel for the Labor Board, consider myself a peace officer of the Labor Board. 
    The traffic policeman, all those who have other duties are also peace officer, every law enforcement officer is in essence fundamentally a peace officer. 
    That is the very basic part of our governmental protection which the citizens expect. 
    We start with that on the assumption and then go on to the more specialized duties. 
    Then at page 11 of our brief, we've -- we have quoted, Senator Wiley's reference to Wisconsin and other states labor boards. 
    And at page 17, we've -- we've quoted in a footnote Senator Taft's actual quotation to Congress of the very section of the Wisconsin law which is primarily here involved. 
    So certainly, when they were talking about and there are many others which we didn't have time or space to quote of course, but when they were talking about continuing state jurisdiction and at the same time talking about these very laws, surely, had they meant to exempt regulation by this type of law, they would have made it clearer in their arguments or in the wording of the law. 
    Now, I wish, however, to go ahead now and try to demonstrate the point that I referred to earlier that the Board tried to apply only those portions of the Wisconsin law which do not involve infringement on an area which this Court has held has been preempted. 
    This Court recognized in the Allen-Bradley case which has been many times cited that the part of the state law which will be considered for purposes of validity is only that part which is applied in the specific case. 
    That we -- we concede that there are other parts of the Wisconsin law including one almost comparable to Section 8 (b) (1) which is the basis of the claim of conflict in this case but they have not been applied here. 
    So our question as to validity of the state action depends only on the action itself, the findings and the specific provisions of law under which they are authorized. 
    Now, counsel objected yesterday to our reference to the fact that Wisconsin law is not concerned solely with employer-employee relations. 
    It makes it an unfair practice for any person to engage in the kind of conduct defining that the law is unfair and counsel said that we did not apply that provision in this case but we did. 
    The greatest, thus far, the greatest number of persons who are restrained by this judgment are members of the union, 2000 or so at least. 
    We couldn't possibly have included them in this proscription had it not been for this provision because we did not attempt to decide on anybody's employee status. 
    We have -- it was suggested that the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act regulates only labor relations. 
    It does, of course, regulate labor relations. 
    But in addition, the legislature has said it also regulates the relations between third parties and the public and those participants in the labor dispute who may go out and infringe on third party's rights. 
    I find that in our Section 111.02 -- no, 111.01 subparagraph (2) of the Wisconsin statute which is quoted at pages 56 to 57 of our brief has been there wrongly cited. 
    The -- the proper citation is 111.01 (2). 
    The legislature said there, "It is also recognized that whatever may be the rights of disputants with respect to each other in any controversy regarding employment relations whatever those may be and disregarding them, they should not be permitted in the conduct of their controversy regarding employment relations to intrude directly into the primary rights of third parties to earn a livelihood, transact business and engage in the ordinary affairs of life by any lawful means and free from molestation, interference, restrain or coercion."

    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    That's right and even applicants for jobs -- oh, in that -- in that connection, I -- I think perhaps I should infringe a lower of my colleagues time to explain how the Board tried to stay away from deciding questions that remain to be decided by the National Labor Relations Board. 
    They tried to preserve the situation so that when the National Board decides the questions before it, which have been pending for years, there will be something on which the National Board's decision can operate. 
    But in -- in trying to preserve that, the Board very carefully tried to refrain and -- and not -- and honestly, it tried to avoid any -- any area which they didn't have the right to go into. 
    This -- the State Board has many times dismissed cases on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and the state court has done so. 
    Of course, the state court had -- felt it had jurisdiction until this Court decided differently in several cases. 
    It has -- for instance, in cases similar to the Garner situation, it has believed that the State had jurisdiction until the Garner decision. 
    But after the Garner decision, it immediately dismissed any matters involving many peaceful picketing on the grounds of illegal objective. 
    Here, however, there are two provisions of the State Board's order that are absolutely unconnected with any employer-employee relations. 
    Everybody involved in this case is proscribed from obstructing or interfering in anyway with ingress to or egress from the Kohler (obstructing or interfering with the free and uninterrupted use of public roads, streets, highways, railways or private drives leading to the premises of the Kohler Company). 
    The -- that -- there is added to that a limitation of the number of pickets. 
    The Board has said that when you go over 200 pickets in that area, in that village, you're mass picketing. 
    You can -- you can go up to 200 pickets without violating this order, 25 at any one gate. 
    That certainly is enough to advertise a labor dispute. 
    That -- those -- those matters are quite irrespective of whether the -- the picketing, the obstruction is engaged in for the purpose of coercing employees and their right or whether it is engaged in for the purpose of -- of merely keeping people out, business out or whether it's out for the purpose of keeping visitors out for any reason. 
    That -- that is proscribed because of the public interest and the interest of the third parties which has been pronounced by the legislature there. 
    And the National Labor Relations Board itself has recognized that it has no authority and -- and will not try to proscribe mass picketing as such. 
    It says -- it said in the Corey Corporation case signed and cited in the brief that it had no authority to affirmatively regulate the number of persons who may probably picket an establishment, it's -- and said then that is primarily a matter for local authorities. 
    All right, now, another part, the other part of the Board's order, Sections 1 and 2 of the proscription are the ones, I believe, on which counsel primarily relies in his suggestion that there has been an infringement of preempted area. 
    The Board, however, referring thereto for making any decision as to who were or who were not entitled to protections as employees. 
    As I pointed out, the state law does have a parallel provisions, Section 8 (b) (1) which proscribes or makes it an unfair practice to coerce employees in their enjoinment of their legal rights guaranteed by -- in this federal law at Section 7 and the state law at section 111.04 (4) I think it is. 
    The Board may absolutely no reference to that Section. 
    It did not refer to employees nor did it -- it proscribed coercion of employees in their rights as employees. 
    It referred to the Section -- the portion of that Section of the law which does proscribe coercion by picketing domiciles and that's the only part of that provision of the law which paralleled the federal law which was referred to by the State Board. 
    And that matter, a picketing of domiciles per se is not covered by the federal law. 
    Now, the State Board in its order proscribed not coercion of employees but coercion of persons desiring to be employed by the Kohler Company. 
    And now, the first reason they did that was a recognition undoubtedly that if any disciplinary action were exerted by the employer, it would be for the National Labor Relations Board to -- to decide whether these people were or were not employees, so the Board -- State Board hasn't tried on that face of the matter at all. 
    Secondly, it -- it made it clear, though there are many people who wanted to apply for jobs that were not -- couldn't, under any circumstances, be considered employees who couldn't even get in to file their applications. 
    So, the Board said, “You shan't coerce a person desiring to be employed." 
    And then it says, “You shan't coerce them with respect to legal rights," not the legal rights guaranteed under Section 111.04 or the legal rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the federal law. 
    There has been no reference to that and that's a very significant omission. 
    The Board is distinguishing and -- and prohibiting the infringement upon people's right to be free in using the streets going where they please from attack, from obstruction and that sort of thing.

    This is not an area where -- where there is interstate commerce. 
    Every bit of this activity took place in one small community area in Wisconsin. 
    It was all intrastate business that was involved. 
    The reason that Congress has legislated with respect to such countries -- companies as Kohler is not because they are engaged in interstate commerce but because they do send their goods in interstate commerce and business affects commerce. 
    But they live in -- in regulating the commerce aspect, the regulation of the local aspect where the companies do business to the community primarily concerned and to the only the community which can step in immediately and prevent mob violence. 
    Congress didn't intend to undertake that responsibility in the federal law unless the State and local governments fail.

    Ms. Beatrice Lampert 
    No, no. 
    This is -- I have not discussed Section 10 (a) at all. 
    These debates that we have quoted and the ones that we have referred to are all with respect to the law in general. 
    Section 10 (a) was not intended in anyway to restrict state rights beyond what they had been restricted before. 
    That was intended to increase state rights in cases where there was actual preemption, but it did not intend to infer or to imply that there would be preemption. 
    It simply meant that where there had been preemption and still in certain cases, the -- the N. L. R. B. could authorize states to act. 
    But where they had been no preemption, of course, there's no need any authority in the part of the N. L. R. B. to authorize states to do something that they had reserved power to do anyway.

    He would also be subject to penalty. 
    We see we don't have a penalty here at all. 
    If we could handle it by means of putting 2000 people in jail, it seems to us that it's infinitely preferable and surely Congress intended that we should be able to handle it by some means avoiding putting 2000 people in jail and letting them know in advance what -- exactly what things they cannot do, the -- exactly the same things that is disagreed -- agreed by everybody are unlawful per se, things that the -- the National Labor Relations Board could not authorize, things that the National Labor Relations Board could not prohibit per se, things that the National Labor Relations Board could reach only indirectly and only partially.

    All it can do is say, “We prohibit you from interfering with the rights of the Kohler Company employees by mass picketing.”

   Argument of Jerome Powell

    Mr. Powell.
speaker="jerome_powell" startTime="3039.965" stopTime="3072.479">
    Mr. Jerome Powell 
    May it please the Court. 
    As Mrs. Lampert has already suggested, we feel quite strongly that the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act, the Section on which the claim of federal preemption here is based, demonstrates quite clearly that Congress expressly intended to preserve state remedies against the sort of violent conduct which is revealed by this record.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3072.479" stopTime="3082.506">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's interesting if you allow me to interpolate -- presented to reserve some state remedy, except that the whole problem is what they are.
speaker="jerome_powell" startTime="3082.506" stopTime="3084.310">
    Mr. Jerome Powell 
    Yes, Your Honor, we concede that. 
    We concede that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3084.310" stopTime="3085.603">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that's the whole problem, isn't it?
speaker="jerome_powell" startTime="3085.603" stopTime="3281.588">
    Mr. Jerome Powell 
    It is, Your Honor. 
    And we recognize, of course, the possibility that Your Honors may not feel that the legislative history is conclusive as to whether this particular state power was in fact intended by Congress to be preserved and that having not found a conclusive answer to that in legislative history, you may have to look elsewhere. 
    And as we read this Court's prior decisions in this field of preemption as applied to labor relations, we understand that the principal basis on which state legislation has previously been stricken down has been a finding of conflict between the state regulation and the federal policy as disclosed in the National Labor Relations Act. 
    We think it's demonstrable here that there is not a conflict between the state regulation and that there is no potential conflict so long as state regulation is confined to the area of violent and coercive union conduct. 
    To demonstrate the absence of actual conflict here, we have to go in part at least to the proceeding which is currently pending before the National Labor Relations Board because Congress -- because, I should say, the appellant has based its principal claim of actual conflict on those proceedings even though they are not a matter of record before this Court. 
    Pleadings that have been put into appellant's appendix show this in regard to that proceeding which is currently going on before the National Labor Relations Board. 
    The union has filed a charge and the Board has issued a complaint that the company, the Kohler Company, has refused to bargain in good faith with the union. 
    As one of the -- of the defenses pleaded in our answer, we set up the fact that the union had engaged in a violent and coercive course of conduct, the same that was pleaded in this Wisconsin case. 
    And that as a result of that course of conduct on the part of the union, we were relieved of the duty to bargain with the union during the period while that conduct was going on. 
    We put in evidence to support that defense that is we have attempted to prove to the Board that the union did in fact engage in this violent conduct. 
    We say, Your Honors, that there is no possibility of conflict in that situation for this simple reason. 
    Nothing that Wisconsin has done can possibly interfere with any action that the Board may take on our proof of that defense. 
    If the National Labor Relations Board concludes that in fact the union's conduct was unlawful, it will then come to the legal question of whether that unlawful conduct was a sufficient excuse for our declining to bargain during the period while the unlawful conduct continued.

    We take the position that the Act does not -- that it will not enforce or -- or it will not express the basic policies of the Act to compel an employer to bargain directly with the union who is -- which is engaged in a concerted campaign of unlawful conduct. 
    And mind you, Your Honors, this did not extend over any great period of time. 
    It was just a period between the time when we filed our complaint with the Wisconsin Board and the time when the Wisconsin Board issued this order. 
    Assuming for the moment that the National Labor Relations Board might find that this conduct which we have now attempted to prove before that Board is not or was not unlawful, there would still be no conflict between what the State has done and what the National Labor Relations Board might do because Wisconsin has done nothing in prohibiting this conduct which the National Labor Relations Board is empowered to prevent -- I mean to protect. 
    There is no potentiality of conflict so long as Wisconsin's regulation stop short of an invasion of those Section 7 rights which the Congress has declared shall be protected. 
    And here Wisconsin has stopped short.

    Mr. Jerome Powell 
    Definitely. 
    I think so, Your Honor. 
    My point is that Wisconsin's injunction prohibits nothing which is protected by Section 7. 
    It prohibits house picketing. 
    It prohibits picketing in numbers in excess of 250 at one time. 
    It prohibits blocking of streets and highways. 
    None of those activities can conceivably come within the protection of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act in view of this Court's prior decision in the Allen-Bradley case. 
    So, there is no possibility even if the National Labor Relations Board should determine that this conduct was not in fact unlawful, there is no possibility that the Wisconsin prohibition can have interfered with the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7.

    Mr. Jerome Powell 
    It does not as such, Your Honor. 
    What the Act as amended permits the Board to do is to eliminate certain effects of violent and coercive conduct. 
    The Act as amended provides that it -- this is Section 8 (b) (1) (A) on which the claim of preemption here is founded. 
    The Act provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to coerce or restrain employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7. 
    Now, Your Honors will observe from that, that the Act does not prohibit any specific conduct. 
    It prohibits only the effect of conduct on employees as such.So that when the Labor Board issues an order under Section 8 (b) (1), it does not prohibit a labor organization or its agent from doing anything. 
    It only says, “In doing whatever you may do, you shall not invade the rights of employees guaranteed by Section 7.” 
    And the result, of course, of that very limited regulatory power in the Board is to leave the conduct itself unaffected.

    Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe 
    Counsel for the Kohler Company and counsel for the Wisconsin Board have suggested that the order in this case and the Wisconsin statute enable the Wisconsin Board to prohibit any person rather than an employee acting individually or in concert from committing unfair labor practices. 
    It is true that there is such a section in the Wisconsin statute. 
    That is the Wisconsin statute contains prohibitions against employers, prohibitions against employees and prohibitions against any person. 
    That Section which contains that prohibition against any person is Section 111.63. 
    It was not invoked in this case. 
    The Wisconsin Board's findings are based on Section 111.6 (2) which is the Section that directs itself towards employees acting individually and in concert. 
    And two of the respondents in the Wisconsin proceeding were labor organizations, a number of other respondents were agents of labor organizations. 
    And to that extent at least, the Wisconsin -- the Wisconsin regulation duplicates the kind of regulation which the federal board could have engaged upon in this case.

    Do you think it makes a difference what specific provision a state agency professes, base an order on if the state law avows from this other sections such an order. 
    I take it, the rule of federal court that an indictment is labored by a particular statute and it isn't valid under that statute, it doesn't make any difference if it's trailed in other -- some other statute.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3980.344" stopTime="3997.694">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- let me make my question more specific. 
    Do you claim that the Board, the Wisconsin Board, was lending itself to an attempt of the Kohler Company to have its dispute with the union adjudicated in a state jurisdiction rather than the -- the Board?
speaker="kurt_l_hanslowe" startTime="3997.694" stopTime="4155.136">
    Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe 
    Certainly, that is the case. 
    The Kohler Company could have filed charges substantially similar to those filed in the state complaint before the federal board and could have had them heard there. 
    There's no question that the federal board would have had jurisdiction over them. 
    Wisconsin -- the Kohler Company elected to take its complaint before the Wisconsin Board and in that sense, the -- the Kohler Company, of course, is in the position of shopping for its form which we are not. 
    And the counsel for Kohler Company demonstrated in this connection that the issues in this dispute are interrelated because they are -- have finding it necessary to plead some of the same things that were pleaded before the state board before the federal board. 
    And as I argued yesterday, we were unable to do this. 
    In other words, we have claimed that the Kohler Company has engaged in course of conduct of various kinds. 
    We attempted to defend in the state proceeding on that basis. 
    We were told by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin and I read from its decision on page 13 of the record, "Appellant's brief asserts that the Kohler Company has in its plant the supply of clubs, guns and tear gas and they submit that it is unjust for the state agencies to restrain the actions of appellants while doing nothing about that. 
    If the appellants considered or do now consider the presence of these munitions wrongful as an unfair labor practice, they could and still can petition the Board for its abatement." 
    Well, the fact of the matter is that we could not do that because as I understand the decisions of the Court, one thing is quite plain, employer unfair labor practices subject to federal regulation as these would be are no longer subject to state board regulation. 
    Therefore, we were unable to have our conduct adjudicated in its context and in its relationship to the company's conduct. 
    And in other -- put another way, the Wisconsin Board, conceding all of this about employer unfair labor practices, is asserting the right to adjudicate certain union unfair labor practices as an exception to the general rule and in isolation in a vacuum unrelated to the other conduct in a complex labor dispute.

    Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe 
    The order of the Board and of the Court directed the respondent unions and others from forcing and intimidating any person desiring to be employed by the Kohler Company in the enjoyment of his legal rights, intimidating his family, picketing his domicile or injuring the person or property of such person or his employee, hindering or preventing mass picketing. 
    I shall not read the entire order, I will merely quite note that it seems to me specious for the Wisconsin Board to claim that the legal rights of a person desiring to be employed by the Kohler Company are not substantially identical to the rights of an employee under the federal statute to engage in or refrain from engaging in concerted activities.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="4221.948" stopTime="4228.390">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, did you -- you say that this might be at least a violation of 8 (b)?
speaker="kurt_l_hanslowe" startTime="4228.390" stopTime="4250.844">
    Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe 
    If the same conduct were proven before the federal board, there is no question that a substantial measure of it would be found to be a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the federal statute. 
    Now, we are not saying that the federal board would necessarily have made those same findings, but if they have --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="4250.844" stopTime="4254.940">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    They'd have jurisdiction over a -- interference with a non-employee?
speaker="kurt_l_hanslowe" startTime="4254.940" stopTime="4381.047">
    Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe 
    Yes, indeed. 
    We have -- we have cited in our brief a large number of cases where the -- where the -- the federal board has found much if not all of the conduct that was found to be a violation of the Wisconsin statute -- to be a violation of the federal statute. 
    Now, with respect to persons desiring to be employed rather than employees, I would suggest that this Court has held that a person not yet employed but at the point of employment enjoys the statutory rights of employees under the federal Act. 
    And consequently -- consequently, a person wanting to be employed by Kohler Company, whom the Kohler Company wants to employ, would be an employee entitled to the protection of the federal statute. 
    Now, we concede that the federal board would have no jurisdiction over, let us say, customers of the Kohler Company or other business visitors. 
    And indeed, the -- the Wisconsin Board's order may also be directed towards the rights of such people and those -- and -- and such people would not, of course, be able to go to the federal board. 
    But I would note that if the federal board, let us say, were to enjoin mass picketing as they could, if they found that to interfere with employee rights by those same business visitors would derive precisely the same benefit from the federal board order that they derive from the state board order. 
    And I am advised by my associate from Wisconsin that as a matter of fact, the Wisconsin Board does not take complaints from anyone other than employers, employees and labor unions. 
    In other words, people engaged in a labor dispute so that the injured third person couldn't bring his complaint before the Wisconsin Board.
