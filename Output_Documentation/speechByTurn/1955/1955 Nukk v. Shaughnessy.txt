    Ms. Agrin, you may proceed.

    Ms. Gloria Agrin 
    If the Court please. 
    I was at a point of describing the provisions of the orders of supervision which were drawn and issued by the appellee herein to each of the appellants. 
    One provision which was constant throughout all of the orders was a requirement that the appellee -- each of the appellants report to an officer of the Immigration Service once weekly on Ellis Island to New York Harbor. 
    After these actions were began in the court below, that provision was changed to once monthly and when for budgetary reasons, the Ellis Island establishment was closed, the place of reporting was changed to some place on the Island of Manhattan at 70 Columbus Avenue. 
    The orders further require the aliens to notify the Service of change of residence and change of employment within 48 hours after such change is made. 
    The appellants are also required to apply for permission for a change of residence from the Third Immigration District to any other immigration district in the country. 
    They are required also by the order to report for psychiatric and medical examination when it is necessary and to give such information as may be deemed fit and proper under oath. 
    In more than half of the orders, the appellants are prohibited from going outside of an area within 50 miles from Times Square in New York, I assume as the crow flies. 
    Each of the order contains a directive that the alien terminate membership in the Communist Party per se or association with the Communist Party per se, or any of its branches, subdivisions or affiliates, either here or in any other country. 
    Another section of the order requires that the alien terminate associations with any individuals they know to be Communists or who aid and further the policies and doctrines of the Communist Party. 
    There was an exception made for spouses and attorneys, provided however that association with such spouse or attorney is not done in furtherance of the doctrines or the policies of the Communist Party, of any of its branches, subdivisions or geographical differentiations. 
    The aliens are also directed by the order, which subjects them of course to criminal penalty for violation of it within a -- with an additional criminal penalty not to violate the Smith Act or the Internal Security Act of 1950. 
    After these orders were issued to each of these appellants, the actions which the appeal is being taken from were commenced in the District Court under Title V Section 1009, the appellants contending that they were parties aggrieved by the administrative order of the appellee. 
    These actions asked for the relief authorized by Section 1009 (b) of declaratory judgment and auxiliary injunctive relief. 
    They asked that the statute in question 1252 (d), the regulation promulgated under the statute 8 C.F.R. 242.3 (c), as applied by the orders of supervision issued to each of these plaintiffs was unconstitutional. 
    They also asked that the District Director, the appellant -- appellee, be directed to cancel the orders and be directed not to seek compliance with them and not to enforce them. 
    Temporary stays of varying kinds were granted by the individual judges to whom orders -- orders to show cause were directed. 
    The Government made motions to dismiss the complaint on the ground that there was the failure to join an improper party, on the ground further that it did not play the cause of action and to vacate the temporary restraining orders which were exempt at that time. 
    They also asked for the convocation of a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2282 and 2284. 
    The appellants did not oppose the convocation of a three-judge court.It was convened -- it consisted of Circuit Judge Medina and District Judges McGohey and Weinfeld. 
    They reheard argument on June 30th, 1954. 
    In October of 1954, they handed down their decision which granted the relief requested by the Government on the sole ground that there was no present case and controversy between the Party's plaintiff and the Party's defendant. 
    The decision of the court below did not reach the merits. 
    It is the appellant's contention --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="gloria_agrin" startTime="333.913" stopTime="857.981">
    Ms. Gloria Agrin 
    We have brought an action only under the Administrative Procedures Act. 
    The second paragraph of Section 1009 says that such an action may be brought in many forms, in the form of a declaratory judgment, in the form of an injunction action, in the form of a writ of habeas corpus, which does not -- is involved here. 
    But it is not being brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act as such. 
    It is our contention that the facts and circumstances of this case prevent -- present a classic example of a justiciable case in controversy, the lower court to the contrary notwithstanding. 
    The main thrust of our argument on the merits, as Mrs. Freedman shall show, is that it is unlawful and unconstitutional to restrict the conduct and activities of these appellants under this statute 1252 (d), under the regulation promulgated under the statute as applied to each of these appellants by the orders of supervision issued severally against each of them. 
    This in effect is the only issue. 
    There are many reasons why our contention -- reasons urged for our contentions of unlawfulness and unconstitutionality. 
    But the only issue is the issue relating to the validity of the statute as applied. 
    In relation to this, the Government concedes and you will find it at pages 26 of their brief and at 32 and 33, and I quote from page 26, "This one issue seems to meet the minimum constitutional requirements of a case or controversy.” 
    The appellants grow up from this. 
    The logical conclusion therefore that the controversy should be decided. 
    The Government, on the other hand, engages in what I would consider a futile search to find reasons why the controversy should not be decided. 
    It will be interesting for the Court to note that the Government abandons the position of the court below as to why this case and controversy should not be decided. 
    The court below had found that there was no present controversy for the reason that the orders of supervision were not self-executed. 
    I call only briefly to the Court's attention, its decision in Columbia Broadcasting System against the United States, which is cited in our brief, that's at 316 U.S, where this Court said, "The regulations are not less reviewable because their promulgation did not operate of their own force. 
    When they are promulgated by order, they are appropriately subject of attack.” 
    The same doctrine is carried through in enumerable decisions, among them Parker against Fleming, La Crosse Telephone against Wisconsin Employment Board and the several others that are cited in our brief. 
    So that in this respect, the opinion of the court below is obviously contrary to what this Court has previously held. 
    The second ground, which one would assume that the Court relied on, was that this appellant was not an adverse -- this appellee was not an adverse party to the appellant for the reason that the statute becomes enforceable by criminal sanctions. 
    This Court too, when I called to its attention, its decision in Rochester Telephone Company in 307 U.S. and Shields against Utah Railroad Company in 305 U.S., to the effect that even in relation to a statute where the sanctions are criminal, the order itself is considered part of the regulatory scheme. 
    And the issuance of the order by the administrator makes that administrator an adverse party and properly so. 
    It is another reason that we submit that the decision of the court below is wrong. 
    I should like to turn only for a few moments to the positions adapted by the Government instead of the position of the court below. 
    They seem to fall into two minor categories and one major category, and I applied the characterization of the Government. 
    I, myself, can't distinguish why one is minor and the other is major. 
    One of the minor categories and reasons that the Government says that this case should not presently be decided is because the appellants have not exhausted their administrative remedies. 
    I have pointed out to the Court that neither the statute nor the code of federal regulation establishes any remedy for either the modification of the orders of supervision, once they are issued by the District Director or from an appeal from the orders for any reason whether the grounds of unconstitutionality or on the grounds of unreasonableness. 
    The Government's argument boils down simply to this, that this appellant had not begged the District Director to change. 
    They have not gone in and said look, this creates terrible problems for me, and if the District Director had a good breakfast and felt well that morning, he might change it. 
    It has never been my experience, and I have found no case in this Court where begging, pleading or shouting over a telephone was considered an administrative remedy that had to be exhausted before review could be held in the federal courts. 
    I would challenge the Government to find a regulation, a written rule which gives these appellants some recourse from the order once it has been issued. 
    There is none. 
    There is no administrative procedure that needs to be exhausted before going into the courts. 
    The second minor premise of the Government's argument is that many of the appellant's contentions are remote and speculative. 
    I submit that this conclusion on the part of the Government can only be drawn from a misapprehension of the arguments made by the appellants. 
    One of the grounds urged for the unconstitutionality of the statute on its phase and as applied, is that the statute is vague and indefinite in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
    In their brief, the appellants have tried to show the manner in which the words used are as broad as to create confusion as to what the duties and obligations of each of the individual appellants might be under them. 
    That some or all of these things may be -- may happen, as it may happen under any vague statute, is not to be contested but we have a present claim. 
    A present claim to the vagueness of the statute and we do not ask that future possibilities under this vague statute be -- be enjoined. 
    We ask that now, this statute that is perfectly bad because of its vagueness be struck down. 
    And that, as far as we are concerned sir, is the argument to the remote and speculative contention of the Government as -- as it relates to our claim. 
    The Government seeks to avoid its major concession as to justiciability by the judicious use of artful adjectives. 
    They say, yes, you have a case in controversy. 
    They say, yes, you have adverse parties. 
    They say, yes, an order, a judgment of a court can solve the controversy between you. 
    But they say it shouldn't do it here because there is no concrete factual background. 
    Our constitutional issues they say are ill-defined. 
    And they cite as authority for not accepting review of the case, the cases of United Public Workers against Mitchell and the International Longshoremen against Boyd. 
    Those were the factual situations of those two cases. 
    They are not of this case. 
    The appellant contends that we have here against each of the appellants a final administrative order, saved of course, if they are required to beg for a change. 
    It commands each of the appellants to do or refrain from doing certain specified act. 
    We contend --

    As a matter of fact, I'd like to call to the Court's attention that some -- some three of the appellants here applied for permission to come down and listen to this argument. 
    And they were denied for a -- it was denied over a period of almost a week and only we learned today from Mr. (Inaudible) that -- late yesterday, that permission was granted. 
    But it required the attention of an attorney to intervene with the Service to get them to offer permission to come down and hear the arguments here today. 
    I would just like to conclude by saying that where we have us here a final order with specific directions against the appellants. 
    Where the appellants say there is no right to impose this order, and the respondents say that they do have a right. 
    And where an order of this Court could satisfactorily conclude the controversy, there is here a justiciable case and controversy which this Court ought to decide on the merits. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Blanch Freedman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="999.857" stopTime="1004.235">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Freedman.
speaker="blanch_freedman" startTime="1004.235" stopTime="1218.378">
    Ms. Blanch Freedman 
    If it please the Court. 
    The issues that are involved in -- in these cases are a first impression. 
    In terms of legal postulation, it poses a question of legislative power. 
    But in terms of human beings in a frame of reference that encompasses the 14 persons now before this Court as appellants and the enumerable others throughout the nation who are similarly situated, the problem presented today to this Court is one that moved Circuit Judge Anderson in 1925 in a parallel case In re -- the petition of Brooks to say, "Slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment.” 
    The appellants are non-citizens and with the exception of two, they are all advanced in years. 
    They have lived in this country for many years.Four of them have lived here for almost 50 years, eight for over 30, and two for approximately 17. 
    They are working men and women with American families and American children. 
    Some have had sons who have served in -- in World War II. 
    One has had a son who was killed in the Battle of the Bulge. 
    They are carpenters, they are painters, they are mattress makers, they are salesman, clerks, bookkeepers in the ordinary works of those who labor. 
    Now, for the past two and a half to one and a half years, each of these appellants have been working and living under the oppressive yoke of an order of supervision. 
    Let me state and describe. 
    In some of the cases, the order physically ties the appellant to an area of land that is measured by a radius of 50 miles beginning from Times Square in the City of New York. 
    Now, it is this power asserted by the Government to thus enthrall these non-citizens that is being challenged here this afternoon? 
    We submit, sirs, that Section 1252 (d) under which the attorney general presumes to act is -- is an unconstitutional deprivation of the life, of the liberty, and property of the appellants. 
    And is unconstitutionally inflicts upon them punishment. 
    In a lower line of cases, this Court has held that non-citizens are entitled in their person, and in their property, and in their effects to the protection of all the laws of our land, including the Constitution of the United States. 
    You gentleman said that in the -- in the case of Chu. 
    You said that in the case of Bridges against Brickton. 
    You said that in the case Carlson against Landon, the very case upon which the Government bottoms its entire support of its position.

    Ms. Blanch Freedman

    No supervision at all.

    Oh, there are other provisions of the law, sir, which gives the Government the address at all times and the whereabouts at all times, not only of these non-citizens but of every non-citizen to which -- to which these appellants are also subject. 
    So that they are always -- that is day by day, I mean, the Immigration Service, the United States Government is always in possession of the immediate current address and whereabouts of the appellant.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1355.219" stopTime="1357.241">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    And you don't take exception to that?
speaker="blanch_freedman" startTime="1357.241" stopTime="1488.963">
    Ms. Blanch Freedman 
    No, we are not raising. 
    That is the part of the Alien Registration Act, which carries penalties all of its own. 
    Now, the power to detain or otherwise restrain the liberty of non-citizens without judicial trial had been sanctioned by this Court, but only as an incident to the power to deport, only as an incident to the power to deport or in making arrange -- actual arrangements for deportation. 
    This Court held in the case Carlson against Landon and intimated it again in the case of Wong Wing against the United States. 
    That the power to deport carried with it the power to detain an alien pending deportation proceeding. 
    Pending arrangements for actual deportation, so that the United States Government during deportation proceeding can keep incarcerated, keep imprisoned a non-citizen from the day of -- the day that he serves the warrant for arrest to deportation until the final expiration of a finding of deportability and for an additional period to prepare and make arrangements for their actual departure. 
    But this Court has also said that the political power to deport cannot and may not be used to deprive a non-citizen of liberty or inflict punishment upon them. 
    And they cannot do that even to a non-citizen who has been found deportable. 
    I think in the case of Mezei against the United States, it appears on page 25 of my brief -- I beg your pardon, it's Mezei against Shaughnessy. 
    The Circuit Court --

    Justice Harold Burton 
    Mrs. Freedman, do you object then that the six months period are only when the six months is over?

    Ms. Blanch Freedman 
    Oh, we don't raise the six months period. 
    We will concede that during the six months period from the time a finding of deportability is administratively made. 
    And for a period of six months, it may well be that that is a reasonable time in which to hold a non-citizen who has been found deportable in custody while you are making arrangements for deportation. 
    But the law recognizes that there may come a period, and they have said that that period comes at the end of the six months -- upon the expiration of the six months. 
    That you cannot deport -- that you cannot deport a non-citizen.

    First, what kind of situation do you see in which we arrive in a more hypothetical case (Inaudible) taken one day and two months within the six months period.

    I will give you two actual cases.

    The case of Blankenstein and the case of Cushman, I believe Mr. Cushman is one of the defendants. 
    We went into Court -- we went into Court and we demonstrated that in the case of Mr. Cushman, it was impossible to deport Mr. Cushman. 
    He came from the Soviet Union. 
    The Soviet Union said that they would not accept this man, that this man had expatriated himself years ago. 
    The same was true with Blankenstein, and there the -- it was an expression of the -- of the District Court that where -- where you actually have on your hand an inviable power to deport or the power to deport has become inviable.

    An alien in this country is illegal and therefore his presence in this country should determine and yet you say why that is so and while there are difficulties, while the time hasn't come when the Government can exercise that power, it has no other means of assuring itself the opportunity that that people are taking except by giving him notice when the time comes and deliver himself up, that's your position?

    What that Section authorizes Congress -- what Congress has authorized the attorney general to do in that Section has -- has violated the rights of the freedom and the liberties of these individuals.

    Ms. Blanch Freedman 
    I believe, sir, it is on the face of the statute. 
    To me, it appears that the question of imprisonment maybe one -- maybe one -- one of degree. 
    If you can say to an individual that you may not move beyond an area of 50 miles, you can say to him, you may not move beyond an area of 5 miles, 3 miles, 2 miles beyond your back door. 
    You can effect even a house arrest.

    Ms. Blanch Freedman 
    But here -- but this is a broad power. 
    The fact is that the Government claims. 
    The Government claims that under this -- under this Section they have the power to deport. 
    They have the right and they so say on page 48 of their brief, the power to hold in custody once you have a deportable alien. 
    And if -- if the Government can regulate, supervise, and restrict the motion and the activities, and the movements, and say with whom an individual may associate, then they -- they very well may be able to hold in custody for the rest of they -- of their of natural lives, these individuals whom cannot -- who cannot be deported.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm trying to suggest to you that this absolutely is your argument. 
    Don't get anywhere with (Inaudible) but it seems to me a very futile way of arguing the case, when it comes to the argument (Inaudible) 
    The Government isn't here saying because they can deport him, they can impose any condition. 
    The Government isn't here to say they can therefore determine -- have to get the Government's position as to who should marry who. 
    The Government doesn't say we contend that we can lock him up forever. 
    We have a very different case, so there's an irrelevant degree and it would be helpful to argue should be (Inaudible) degree instead of arguing action.

    And I say to this Court that when you take into account the terrific broadness of the power to deport, that -- that the categories who can be made deportable can be -- can be declared deportable for reason or no reason. 
    And then you couple with it a power to permit the Immigration Service, or the attorney general, or anybody to be able to control the lives of these individuals when they are unable to actually effect the deportation, you have developed a very awesome and fearsome power in the hands of a few individuals.

    The provision quoted in appellants' brief was the provision which was applicable to the appellants Gannet, Bittleman and Jones, which was issued in 1953. 
    The Smith Act defendants, which did not have these modification, the subsequent orders, the orders applicable to the appellant Nukk and the others here, the other 11. 
    Most of them have that proviso, all the orders that were issued after 19 -- after January 1st, 1954 have this proviso.

speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3029.893" stopTime="3347.921">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    I certainly will, Your Honor. 
    The real problem here and the knob of this case can be very simply stated. 
    Appellants are aliens who have been actually ordered deported on account of membership in a subversive organization, the Communist Party. 
    Now, the basic question is whether these aliens have a constitutional right to be free from all supervision, no matter how reasonable it is, pending their ultimate deportation once six months have passed without deportation being effect. 
    I think that's a fair statement of the hardcore problem which is presented by this case. 
    There's another basic issue on the merits, which we cannot ignore, whether such aliens have a constitutional right to continue their subversive associations and activities, pending ultimate deportation. 
    As I understand the appellant's argument, they have a right to continue membership in the Communist Party and to continue Communist activities and associations. 
    However, before reaching these basic constitutional issues, we have to consider a threshold issue of jurisdiction -- of justiciability, whether a case or controversy appropriate for judicial determination has been alleged by these 14 appellants or rather these 11 appellants as to whom the order is currently applicable. 
    It is to that threshold problem which the first part of my argument will be directed, whether these broad issues on the merits are properly before the Court, depends on the solution of the threshold issues. 
    As Ms. Agrin pointed out, the court below did not reach the merits. 
    It assumed that no justiciable case or controversy had been alleged. 
    Now, this is a case where they challenge statue and the administrative rulings issued under it, have we concede some degree of present impact on this litigants? 
    The other hand, the impact is hard to pin down. 
    It is partially in the present, it appears to be substantially in the future. 
    And the real question is where to draw the line, as regards to the degree of present impact, which it is -- which is necessary to have in order to make a matter justiciable. 
    Now, we have real trouble with one facet of this case. 
    As we concede in our brief, the arguments are very close on justiciability. 
    We have made an advocate's presentation of those matters. 
    We feel we're obligated to the Court to do so under its prior decisions. 
    But we don't feel that there's only one answer that reasonable lawyers or reasonable judges could arrive as to certain facets of justiciability in this case. 
    As to other facets of the case, we feel very strongly that too broad on attack has been attempted and that there are some matters certainly which are clearly beyond the scope of what a court can properly consider at this time. 
    Now, the difficulty here with the justiciability issues arises because there is a tremendous variation in the relative degree of rightness for judicial review of the individual substantive issues. 
    For instance, the requirement relating to medical and psychiatric examinations to which reference has been made. 
    The order merely states that you may be called upon to submit to such examination if necessary, the statute said. 
    There's no allegation that any of these appellants have been asked to submit to such an examination. 
    If there is any substantial constitutional question that arises in connection with such medical examination. 
    And we do not believe that there is any, but if there is, the appropriate time to consider it is when the issue is -- has a direct eminence rather than a mere future impact.

speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3364.811" stopTime="3372.265">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    We would not be adverse to having a decision from this Court on that constitutional issue if we are entitled to it.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3372.265" stopTime="3380.844">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, in the plain -- prior to that language, you don't really say that this isn't justiciable to that extent, do you?
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3380.844" stopTime="3383.643">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    I don't think the answer is quite that easy, Your Honor.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    All right.
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3384.884" stopTime="3493.784">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    And it's tied up with the scope of permissible review under the Administrative Procedure Act which presents the -- which presents the problem. 
    The nature of this statute providing for supervision, Congress hasn't fixed hard and fast rules. 
    If Congress recognizes there's got to be some variation in case to case, discretion is lodged in the attorney general to mold a supervision order which meets the particular case. 
    Now, once an alien becomes subject to supervision, that is when six months have elapsed after the deportation order has become final, an order is served on these aliens which in part is a printed form. 
    If Your Honors will look at the record where the order is set forth on pages 12, 13, and 14, the Sections on 13, numbered 1, 2, 3 (a), 3 (b), and 4. 
    They are all part of a printed form, as is the material that appears on page 12 with respect to the Communist association provisions, items 5 (a), (b) and (c) and the travel limitation on page 14 item 6, those as the record which is before the Court shows, have been typewritten (Inaudible) 
    That is a --

speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3528.714" stopTime="3535.143">
    Mr. Attorney General

    Mr. Attorney General 
    I think -- I think that all, Your Honor. 
    Of course there are some blanks in that printed form as to how frequently reporting should take place, or when, or whether should be in person or in writing. 
    But in substance, the first part of the order is pretty much of a standard form and yet modifications can be made on application. 
    Now, there is no provision. 
    There is no regulation then promulgated providing for application. 
    The administration, as we understand, has been relatively flexible. 
    The -- if an alien wishes guidance as to a provision or he calls to the attention of the District Director, certain provision that has unusual impact, a change may be made. 
    That is up to the District Director if he has some question about it, he will refer to higher headquarters for advice as to whether this provision should be appropriate in this kind of case or not.

    Mr. Attorney General 
    I would -- I would be very surprised if -- when that provision was called to the attention of the District Director, it would not be modified in that way. 
    I believe these modifications which have come in have frequently been due to specific circumstances being called to their attention.. 
    For instance --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not really to imply any criticism of (Inaudible) I'm saying the foundation perfectly.

    That depends upon the individual case.

    Mr. Attorney General 
    It -- our position essentially is this, that if there is some matter which arises, which is peculiar to the facts of some individual alien, that he should first call it to the attention of the administrative officials. 
    If he does not get relief, having called that to the attention of the administrative officials, as far as we can see, he has a -- an appealable case under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    But does he have an appealable case under the Administrative Procedure Act where he runs to the Court immediately or whether --

    Mr. Attorney General 
    It's -- it's a matter -- it's really a matter of good practice. 
    I don't think it's necessarily required by the statute but I think I can illustrate it this way. 
    If the appellant sought administrative clarification of ambiguities, and if they called attention to all individual hardships, and if they raised the questions of any possible lack of administrative authority, whether some of these provisions are too -- too broad as a matter of delegation or a matter of authority under the statute, then the issues would very likely be reduced in scope. 
    They'd be clarified and they'd be shuttled, and then we'd have to concede, we recognize a right to review under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.

    If this Court fails that the matter is sufficiently clear and the facts is sufficiently definite to justify that adjudication, we don't stand very strongly.

    So I understand that was put in as an excess of caution, but with response of the Act staying, of course that was intended and if you want the clarified why, go ahead and put that in. 
    It was -- it wasn't in the Act that originally grafted.And I read this provision in the light of the constitutional protections, which are well recognized.

    We have applied for the following relief from this order to the appellee and he has rejected our application, then we would say, as to those matters, there is a right to review under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    It's the absence of that allegation, which we believe makes these -- these complaints fatally defective under the Administrative Procedure Act, where it is so apparent from the kind of order we have and from this record, which shows actual modifications of the 50-mile limit and of the requirement report in person as to one of the appellants who called the attention of the District Director, an illness, and requested permission to remain away from -- stay at a health resort and not to report in person. 
    The order was promulgated so as to give those particular modifications.If those modifications have been denied, then that would have been a very serious question, which as far as I can see would be reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act.

    Is that what you suggest?
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="5081.444" stopTime="5276.773">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    My own view is perhaps more liberal than the view of the Court on some of these matters of justiciability in -- in the -- in the past. 
    I find no constitutional objection to passing on many features of the issues which are raised here and I think our brief is -- is directed in that -- in that fashion. 
    But I have a serious question as to whether anything else is properly justiciable at this stage other than these hardcore issues, which I have referred to in the argument, which are referred to in point 1 (c) of our brief, pages 32 to 39. 
    Turning to the merits, our problem is essentially this, whether a statute -- whether this statute, this particular statute, directing supervision is constitutional as a whole and as to each of its four basic directive. 
    The four basic directives, I think, Your Honors, are now familiar with, the statute set forth in page 5 of the Government's brief, the directive to appear periodically for identification, to submit to medical examinations if necessary, to provide information when requested, and to conform to reasonable written restrictions on conduct and activities. 
    We have another issue on the merits, whether the statute has been properly construed and applied by those administering it. 
    It is possible that the statute on its phase may be constitutional and yet that some provision of the order may exceed the authority which the statute give. 
    We do not in anyway concede that any portion of this order is -- goes beyond the authority delegated by the statute. 
    However, it is a possibility which Your Honors should consider. 
    Now, on -- perhaps the best way to deal with this matter on the merits and a great many possible objections have been raised in the brief, is to consider that statute and the -- each section of the order. 
    At this point, I am assuming virtually complete justiciability for purposes of this portion of the argument. 
    The statute is set forth on page 5 of our brief. 
    The sample order is set forth on pages 13 -- 12, 13, and 14 of the record. 
    If Your Honors care to follow with the two provisions, I will go down step-by-step. 
    The statute requires that appellants in this -- or the aliens in this particular category, against whom a final order of deportation is outstanding should appear from time to time for identification before an officer of the Immigration Service.

    What is meant by identification?

    Mr. Attorney General 
    I would --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5282.240" stopTime="5284.337">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't quite understand that one. 
    I'm just curious.
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="5284.337" stopTime="5710.006">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    They -- if you -- if Your Honor will look at page 13 of the record, the -- in Section 4 -- under Section 4, that's two-thirds the way down. 
    There is a form -- and this comes from the printed form statement as to when a -- a written report is made. 
    What the administrative officials ask -- ask for in an administrative report, the name, the alien registration number, the date, his current address, and his place of employment. 
    Now, that's perhaps a little more -- more than just identification but I take it, they have to disclose their -- they have to report, check in, show their alien identification card. 
    I wouldn't have any -- the record doesn't show what more would be meant than that. 
    The actual order as modified in this case, as originally issued, weekly reporting was required. 
    While this litigation was pending, the policy changed. 
    This plastic order was revised to substitute monthly reporting. 
    So our test is, is it unreasonable?Is it unconstitutional for Congress to single out aliens in this particular class and say, "Once a month, you shall appear before an immigration officer for identification.” 
    Now, Congress hasn't specified that it would be a month later, they merely said time to time and left up to the discretion of the administrative official. 
    Has there been any abuse of discretions in fixing a monthly period? 
    We state that -- we submit that this -- that that issue cannot be seriously argued that there's anything unconstitutionally wrong, any improper clarification in that specific provision of the statute. 
    And if we are permitted to have it, we would appreciate a ruling on constitutionality from this Court, which would settle a lot of doubts and litigation on that particular point. 
    We feel so unsubstantial that such a ruling is proper even in the state of this record. 
    The second requirement of the statute, to submit if necessary to medical and psychiatric examination at Government expense, and in the order that is the provision that's filed in Section 2 of the sample order, page 13, that the alien shall -- shall upon request produce himself at a time and place designated for the purpose of submitting to medical psychiatric examinations. 
    The purpose of those examinations is brought out in the briefs. 
    The charge of course was made in some of the supporting affidavits, that these examinations would have been used as a -- to brainwash aliens with unpopular views and to harass them. 
    There's no allegation that a single one of these aliens has been asked to submit to such an examination. 
    The record shows that they are used to get information required by foreign countries as to the state of the health of the person for whom travel documents are asked. 
    They have also used in case somebody claims inability to perform a -- one of these requirements of the order on grounds of health. 
    Perfectly reasonable provisions, we submit, we can't see any substantial constitutional issue as to those matters. 
    Free to give information under oath as to nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, activities, and such other information, not -- whether or not related to the foregoing as the attorney general may deem fit and proper. 
    And as the Chief Justice pointed out, the provision in the order with respect to that is merely to furnish such information as may be deemed fit and proper. 
    Now, as to that provision, certainly some of this information is obviously needed under -- for the purposes of implementing the deportation statute. 
    Some of the information may be needed to prevent continuation of the type of undesirable activity which was a basis for deportation, subject always to the right of the alien to claim his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. 
    There are possible questions, which may arise as to the application of that statute. 
    We concede that. 
    We do not believe in the absence of specific allegations as to specific questions that have been asked that there's any matter that's appropriate for a decision at this particular point. 
    The only questions as to which any specification is made are stated in identical terms or virtually identical terms in the supporting affidavits, we've set them forth at page 13 of our brief, and they are not -- they are not questions which any of them alleged have been asked. 
    They expressed their fear. 
    They state this -- this order is broad enough. 
    The statute is broad enough to permit them to be asked what I ate for breakfast, whether I had an argument with my wife, what friends I had dinner with, where I went on Saturday night, what I think of the situation in Indochina. 
    Questions like that. 
    There's no justiciable controversy unless these people will allege specific questions that they're asked, we submit. 
    They do allege in the supporting affidavits that they have been submitted to sweeping interrogation. 
    Each one in identical terms or virtually an example is on page 21 of the record, four lines down when -- there is an allegation, I am subjected to sweeping into interrogations as to my associations and activities. 
    Is that enough to -- not in the complaint, in a supporting affidavit without a single allegation as to what the question was. 
    They show they know how to frame specific questions because four or five lines down, they say he got a right to ask or he could ask what I ate for breakfast. 
    We say more than that is necessary in order to state a justiciable controversy even under the liberal rules of federal pleading. 
    We think that --

    And I -- I think they have, aside this case, was the one that dealt more with the question of vagueness, but question is how much do you have to spell out in a statute in order to permit -- in order to have it meet constitutional standards?

    That this is a permissible -- this is efficiently definite when read in the light of the objectives of the deportation statute. 
    If it goes outside those objectives, presumably, that will be an unlawful attempt to exercise power.

    It may be -- it may be in good standing and these problems of vagueness, if one takes them in the abstract, the difficult way, you have a policy spelled out in these deportation statutes. 
    I believe an opinion of Mr. Justice Reed pointed out, that will give the framework which will permit the administrative discretion to be exercised properly without filing the Constitution.

    Are you going to say anything about associating in paragraph (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="6145.549" stopTime="6371.940">
    Mr. Attorney General 
    That is the -- that's the fourth point. 
    I believe at this point, I've pretty well exhausted the third and the fourth is the requirement that the alien be made to conform to such reasonable written restrictions on his conduct and activities as prescribed by the attorney general in his case. 
    Now, that is fairly broad and yet when you look at the purposes of -- of the statute, the purposes of supervision and read that provision with those purposes in mind, we believe that it is sufficiently definite to meet the constitutional test. 
    After all, what are the purposes of supervision? 
    They're implementing the deportation statute, keeping track of the alien, getting information, trying to make it more difficult to prevent the alien from fading into the population as we have seen some of the defendants in the Dennis case do very successfully, too successfully in fact. 
    And the other purpose of preventing the continuation of the type of undesirable activity which was the basis for deportation, and that brings me to Mr. Justice Douglas' question. 
    Here, the deportation was bottomed on membership in the Communist Party. 
    The only sanction against an alien being a member in the Communist Party was the -- well, there are two sanctions, there's the Smith Act for a certain type of activity and the sanction of being deportable. 
    The sanction of deportation, the deterrence which may be implicit and that are gone now. 
    The threat of deportation is gone. 
    They faced the worst and the Government is powerless to carry the thing out. 
    Now, is Congress free to -- is Congress to have their hands tied and say, "If you can't find some foreign country to take these deportable aliens, if you're going to have them in your midst, then you cannot limit the kind of activity which resulted in their being undesirable citizens.” 
    Now, that's what the administrators obviously driving at. 
    We believe it's clearly within the scope of the statute. 
    It's very difficult to graft a proper provision, that's the kind of provision which we would like to have any individual problems, call to the attention of the administrators. 
    Any of these people who are deprived from seeing their family or associating with their family. 
    We are sure that that would be on this record, it has been taken care of in any part of that was issued after a certain date, presumably after the point it was raised. 
    Now, just what precise limits should be put on that association, that is something we believe it has be worked out on a case by case basis and it's too broad to litigate at this time in advance of specific applications.
