    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Koegel --
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="7.509" stopTime="366.242">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    May it please the Court. 
    I have heard it said many times that hard cases make bad law, it might make bad law and I hasten therefore to make this as least hard as my powers will avail. 
    There is more than a fake suggestion here that there has been callous indifference on the part of the appellee municipality toward the plight of the incompetent whose affairs are now in the hands of a committee. 
    In New York, we say committee. 
    If I mispronounced that word, it's because of my earlier education in Washington where they call it committee, I believe still. 
    I would like to dispel emphatically any such notion and as quickly as I can. 
    I'll take just a minute to plea. 
    I'd like to discuss, sir, but very briefly the municipality and its geography. 
    Somers is a township called "Towns of New York State," organized in 1788. 
    It comprises approximately 26,000 acres and some points are eight miles distance -- distant from others. 
    It is not a homogenous community. 
    A considerable portion of its population is to be found in so-called Somer developments, housing families from New York City. 
    Generally, they are adjacent to lakes, privately owned by the property owners associations. 
    One of several in the community is Lake Purdy, where the property of Nora Brainard, the incompetent here, is situated. 
    Another is Lake Shenorock, where Mr. King lives, five miles distant. 
    I have a country home in Hamlet called Granite Springs, seven miles distant from Lake Purdy. 
    Another community is Lake Lincolndale in the north-central portion of the town. 
    South Somers is seven miles distant from Lake Purdy's and that is where Mr. Chambers lived. 
    The town is bisected with lakes belonging to the water supply of New York City. 
    It takes more than the equivalent time per mile to get from place to place as it would say in Arizona or California. 
    The town house or seat of government is two miles from Lake Purdy in a building known as the Elephant Hotel, built by Bailey of circus fame to commemorate an elephant he brought into this country. 
    None of the elected officials from the Town of Somers come from Lake Purdy. 
    The first attorney for the town in this litigation, Mr. Stanley Anderson, has never lived in the town. 
    At the time of his employment, he lived at Katonah in the Town of Bedford adjoining, which was the home and place where he died of -- the first Chief Justice of this great Court. 
    Also living in Katonah in another township is Mr. Covey, the Committee. 
    He is a lawyer too of this incompetent. 
    As I have said there is no elected official, public official in the Somers Government from Lake Purdy. 
    Now, this is not to suggest that Somers official then do not know people in Lake Purdy, they most certainly do. 
    But everybody's -- everyone's business is not every other person's business in a far flung township as would be the case in a small more closely confined rural town. 
    Appellant states at the outset in his brief that the facts are undisputed. 
    He is more or less justified in that because we have not come to grips with it and I should much prefer to see this case decided on the applicable principles of law rather than upon a narrow factual issue which he says doesn't exist. 
    He says the facts are undisputed because no affidavits were submitted and no proof produced controverting statements made by the appellant, Mr. Covey, the Committee of Nora Brainard and the affidavit of the counselor Mr. King. 
    These were moving affidavits in support of an application for -- in order to show cause and a stay addressed to the County Court, County Court under the foreclosure in rem statute being the Court vested with jurisdiction over those foreclosures except in New York County where there is no County Court and in which case it is the Supreme Court of the State. 
    I will demonstrate I hope that there was a completely improper procedure. 
    The correct one being the filing of a plenary action to set aside the judgment of foreclosure together with the filing of a lis pendens which the statute specifically refers to and makes -- required in the county clerk's office, that was not done either. 
    Now, if I may take up very hurriedly these affidavits and I'll accept them at their face value. 
    We'll see how much value they have on their face. 
    The King affidavit, from investigation made by me and from conversations have --

    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    I'm so sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, at this mark too. 
    The King affidavit is on page -- what is it, 9? 
    4 and 5 --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="386.018" stopTime="386.248">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="386.248" stopTime="592.980">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    -- of the transcript of record. 
    From investigation made by me and from conversations had -- had with the duly elected officials in the Town of Somers, not merely any of them or the purport or substance of the conversation, much less detailed and narrative, I am of the opinion that the said Nora Brainard was and has been incompetent for more than 15 years. 
    If that isn't conclusory, I -- I don't know what is. 
    I had been advised that more than two years ago efforts were made by one of the justices of the peace of the Town of Somers. 
    I'm not saying which one or what advice he got to have her committed to Grasslands Hospital, a state hospital for mental defectives, by reason of her mental condition. 
    I've been further advised that on many occasions, the state police were called to abate the nuisances committed by the said Nora Brainard. 
    It would have been helpful if some slight specification were had in that respect. 
    In the King affidavit, this is also recited that Mr. King is the attorney for Harry B. Brainard which he goes on to -- whom he goes on to describe also as the husband and sole surviving heir at law of the said Nora Brainard. 
    Now, the living could have an heir at law but that's what he says, the said Harry Brainard being a non-resident of the State of New York. 
    So, she was living alone by the very necessary implication -- conclusion of this affidavit. 
    Now, the affidavit of Mr. Covey, the Committee on the subject of the competency of Nora Brainard and with respect to an answer to -- previous to her commitment says only the following, "Upon information and belief, the said Nora Brainard was incompetent, although not adjudged for many years passed and was known to the citizens of the Town of Somers in which she resided and to the officials of the town as a person without mental capacity to handle her affairs and unable to -- and understand the meaning of the notices served personally upon her by mail or by publication." 
    Now, even allowing face value, as I indicated I would to this -- as evident, I submitted, does not amount too much. 
    It is true that it was not denied in answering affidavit for the reason that no answering affidavit was required. 
    An oral return was made by the first counsel in this series that appeared here for the town. 
    I'm number three. 
    He made his conveyance, sir, and a country real estate lawyer. 
    He made an oral submission -- appearance to return on the return date in White Plains of this order to show cause. 
    He submitted a brief memorandum of law after the manner in which I would consider a common law lawyer would say a demurrer ore tenus to the order.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, what surprise me that none is necessary as I understand you to say.
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="711.676" stopTime="1006.942">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    That's my view that none is necessary. 
    I think it's beside the point in this case nothing was filed in any case in the town -- municipality, it is not to be stopped by the negligence of its officialdom. 
    They did the best they could and they did what thought -- they thought wouldn't be improper. 
    I happened to think it was not improper. 
    I would have done it. 
    I would have filed the affidavits strongly resenting if I felt so disposed to do, the implications of this hearsay and broad conclusory sworn status but none -- no -- no issue whatever was tendered on those statements in writing, none whatever. 
    I think the brief of the appellant stretches things a little too far, when on page 5 it suggests that the town attorney, that was Mr. Anderson. 
    He was the counsel for the town. 
    The town doesn't have an official called town attorney. 
    The New York State law provides for one but that town has not. 
    As the counsel for the town especially engaged in this foreclosure work, they begin, Mr. -- the town attorney who applied for the order appointing Mr. Covey special guardian under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. 
    They say, "Why didn't he, since he was so mindful of that, suggest that he should do something with respect to one who he knew to be incompetent?" 
    Well, there's no real proof that he knew anyone to be incompetent. 
    All he had before him was the -- were the two affidavits with the conclusory averments. 
    The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act provides that to the extent of any adverse effect upon anyone in the armed forces and that even goes into the -- carries into the foreclosure in rem statute of New York. 
    A safeguard must be had and that is a special guardian must be appointed to inquire whether any armed forces personnel would be affected by any of these indicated names in the foreclosure proceedings. 
    Nora Brainard's name was one of the defendant's name, perforce the -- Mr. Covey, the same man later appointed Committee here, appointed their special guardian. 
    He came up with the obvious answer, the correct one that no soldier or sailor or marine had an interest affected and therefore he stipulated by order that there were no such -- the implications of that Act and the foreclosure was allowed to proceed on its way. 
    But they suggest from this legal factual record here that the town attorney, that's Mr. Anderson, that he was lax, having been so alert on that Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act not to have seen to it that this woman, obviously, incompetent should have had a Committee appointed for her. 
    I say that that is hardly fair to deduce such an obligation on him from the meagerness of this testimony but I -- I don't want this case to rest on that at all. 
    The only reason I have advanced this is because it was suggested, I think, by Mr. Justice Burton that just what is the extent of the evidence here, from just what do they draw the conclusions that the town knew. 
    Because if the town did know that becomes certainly, in my book, immoral consideration that a proper government should take account of. 
    And I have not prepared on the basis of this record to conceive that this town did something that was patently immoral. 
    Now, then I'm going to use some of my time with the Court's permission, I believe the clerk has already suggested to the Court that permission would be asked to let the Attorney General of New York to have some of my time. 
    I would like to have him have 10 minutes of my time and I will use only of the balance. 
    How many minutes have I -- about 12?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I would like to ask this question. 
    When you started your -- your argument, your first statement as I recall it was that you're going to demonstrate to the Court that this was not harsh or oppressive action on the part of this -- this town against this incompetent?

    Do you feel you have done that?
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="1026.574" stopTime="1066.722">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    I appeal that I have -- I have at least -- maybe I haven't -- maybe I haven't, maybe I over -- maybe I over spoke. 
    What I -- what I meant to say and what I -- perhaps would have been more correct in saying was that I hope to point out that it wasn't patently clear here that the town had been cruelly negligent and had been, beyond any doubt, guilty of -- of complete lack of interest in this unfortunate taxpayer.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1066.722" stopTime="1091.120">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, what do you say about the fact that -- to combined taxes of interest and penalties against his property was about $480 and the city put a minimum price of $6500 on the property and would not consider the payment of the tax or any proceeding that would result in wiping it out for --
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="1091.120" stopTime="1091.311">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    That --

    -- a payment?
speaker="otto_e_koegel" startTime="1091.562" stopTime="1113.368">
    Mr. Otto E. Koegel 
    That why I said and counsel, I'm sure, inadvertently failed to state because his brief goes on hurriedly to state that the town immediately cut that figure in half. 
    I'm not saying that's enough either but the town did cut that $6500 figure down to $3500, am I not right? 
    Now, they -- they admit that.

    Your Honor, there is no opinion in the Court of Appeals as an official opinion of the Court itself. 
    However, there is a memorandum of affirmance which is prepared by the state reporter which is reported in 308 New York 798. 
    That memorandum of -- of affirmance, while drawn by the reporter, is so drawn as to suggest the counsel the basis of the Court's -- the determination in that action. 
    And if you will examine that, I think you will be convinced that the basis of the Court of Appeals' decision in this case was the third ground raised by the respondent in the Court of Appeals. 
    Specifically, that the -- the deed delivered pursuant to a judgment in an in rem proceeding may only be set aside in the manner provided by a statute, namely, by an action to set aside the deed and the filing of a notice of pendency thereof in the office of the county clerk.
