    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, the record shows all the facts and as far as the withdrawal is concerned, there was no formal withdrawal but the bringing of an action amounts to withdrawal from --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="43.847" stopTime="46.610">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Do you take that that's a withdraw?

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It's --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="47.410" stopTime="51.428">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Would it be necessary for them to withdraw to raise the question for this case?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="51.428" stopTime="81.542">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, perhaps we should use the word revoke rather than withdrawal because the action was begun prior to the commencement of arbitration. 
    In other words, we sued in Vermont, and then the other side would move to the federal court and substantially at the same time, began arbitration in New York and then moved to stay, pending the conclusion of the arbitration.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="81.542" stopTime="83.699">

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    If arbitration took place -- it would take place in New York?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="94.213" stopTime="104.918">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, it would take place before the American Arbitration Board, and they have an office in New York and -- and one in Boston, and they have provisions in their --

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    No, but they have provisions in their rules for sending arbitrators out to wherever it might be. 
    And I assume under that that we could have the arbitration in Vermont which would be more convenient for both parties.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="121.437" stopTime="126.790">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, do we have to decide in this case what state law controls?

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    What state law controls? 
    Oh, I think so, Your Honor. 
    Our position is that Vermont state law definitely does control and as a matter of fact, our authorities for that, principally New York cases.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="142.971" stopTime="157.523">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    As --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we have to decide the question I put to you before noon? 
    Do we have to decide if -- if the stay become relevant, what New York is with reference to a contract executed in New York but the legal forum is Vermont without any light from the lower courts?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="175.129" stopTime="204.224">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    My view is, Your Honor, that on the -- that what you really have to decide is whether this case comes under the Erie doctrine. 
    And if it comes under the Erie doctrine then Vermont law applies and the -- the only way to get to that -- to the New York --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="204.224" stopTime="221.076">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I think it's -- is that necessary to this panel? 
    The Erie doctrine merely means that relevant state law and not some concoction of the federal court as to what is the general law, applies. 
    But that doesn't tell me what the relevant state law is.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="221.076" stopTime="226.406">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, isn't that question what the Vermont -- what law the Vermont courts would apply?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="226.406" stopTime="245.497">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that may -- they may not be but assuming it is, have we determined -- do we know, the answer eventually does or an adequate certainty what Vermont law is on this subject? 
    All -- all we know is that Vermont law, that it rules out arbitration.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="245.497" stopTime="247.696">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    You mean on the matter of conflicts, Your Honor?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="247.696" stopTime="255.255">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    This is -- this -- this is a New York -- all these went to that. 
    I mean hardly stay open in my mind, it couldn't be more open.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="255.255" stopTime="255.623">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="255.623" stopTime="307.727">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if New York -- if this is a New York conflict. 
    In the first place, it maybe a question of New York law as to whether or not the law raise the performance of it. 
    In the second place, I do not know, why should I know what Vermont law is as to a contract to be executed in Vermont but -- to be performed in Vermont but executed in New York. 
    On the Vermont we have -- have a law different for what governing body as to a conflict of contracts which is made and is formed in Vermont. 
    In relation to a contract tat exists is made in New York with complete performance in Vermont and New York that has a law as to contracts made in New York to be performed in New York with different problems from contracts made in New York to be performed in Vermont. 
    Any one of those possibilities seem to me relevant, rationally speaking, aren't they?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="307.727" stopTime="308.954">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I think they are.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="308.954" stopTime="312.493">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then, therefore -- and therefore, the question is where do I get the answers to those.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="312.493" stopTime="312.899">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="312.899" stopTime="319.931">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is one of the Vermont (Inaudible) to go through -- then go through Vermont cases to find out? 
    One would get lost to that.

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I don't -- I think, Your Honor, that we can help you sum on that. 
    As far as the actual conflicts question goes, there is virtually no Vermont law order but --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="335.714" stopTime="342.310">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Therefore, we have to prophesize to what Vermont law would be if it came before the Vermont Supreme Court, is that right?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="342.310" stopTime="387.583">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, Vermont has always been a common law state and I think that the -- that the conflicts rule as far as common law goes on what Vermont should do on a contract that was executed in New York to be performed anywhere, provided the case as tried in Vermont, I think that conflict rule is decided by the New York cases of the Mitcham against the Railroad, of matter of Gant, of matter of (Inaudible), and matter of Berkowitz. 
    And those cases all hold that arbitration is a matter of remedy, and --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="387.583" stopTime="387.816">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But --
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="387.816" stopTime="389.275">

    No.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="391.515" stopTime="399.737">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If you prophesize that too much because it's a matter of remedy, you are next going to argue that it is a matter of remedy once it gets into the federal courts.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="399.737" stopTime="412.997">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, I think the distinction there is the distinction drawn in the Guaranty Trust case that what you're talking about is whether it substantially affects the result.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="412.997" stopTime="418.363">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Very well. 
    In those New York cases, to call this remedy doesn't help too much.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="418.363" stopTime="425.725">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, it helps in the sense that it means that Vermont law rather than New York law governs.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="425.725" stopTime="427.630">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But why. 
    We thought --

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="427.836" stopTime="443.245">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It would just -- If I understand that, if I understand myself whether it's remedy or the substance with certain aspect is irrelevant to the question of enforcing, giving counsels in a case we move to the federal courts.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="443.245" stopTime="443.704">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    That's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="443.704" stopTime="450.652">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You go after the different things.Namely, what -- what cloak we are speaking, substantially makes a difference.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="450.652" stopTime="451.113">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="451.113" stopTime="451.814">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that right?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="451.814" stopTime="459.346">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, that' right. 
    That's as to one phase. 
    That is as to whether the state law or federal law applies.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="459.346" stopTime="460.221">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="460.221" stopTime="553.675">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Then once you've decided that state law applies, the question is, what is the state law? 
    And in Vermont, you're pretty much thrown back to -- well, the state law is the common law. 
    And then the next question is, what is the common law? 
    And that's where the Mitcham case and the cases that follow it establish what the common law rule is that would be enforced in Vermont. 
    And it's rather interesting when you talk about possible conflict between Vermont law and New York law, that even where New York, if this case was reversed as to locations, New York I suppose would enforce this arbitration agreement under the New York statute. 
    But the reason that they would apply that statute is exactly the same reason that we're relying on here for not applying it in Vermont. 
    In other words, they would apply it because the case was in New York and because it was a matter of remedy. 
    That was held in every one of the cases that either side have cited it from New York even -- even in the cases where the contract call for application of New York -- of New York law, the basis of the decision was that both parties were voluntarily before the New York court, and that New York would apply its own law as to this matter of remedy.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="553.675" stopTime="560.186">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You say this according to Vermont law the question of remedy, is it? 
    Well, the common law would make it remedy --
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="560.186" stopTime="560.510">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="560.510" stopTime="564.527">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- and the common law you derive from the New York cases would have gone back when, is that right?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="564.527" stopTime="565.258">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    That's right and they --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="565.258" stopTime="588.181">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, you think if it's remedy in Vermont law, it isn't true under the Guaranty Trust Company to every question of remedy. 
    It means the opposite issues that every question of remedy of the State is enforced by the federal court, I mean that doesn't answer the problem, does it?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="588.181" stopTime="605.105">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    No, it doesn't but in the very Guaranty case itself, the statute involved was the statute of limitations. 
    And that as you said in your decision in that case has been held to be a matter of procedure.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="605.105" stopTime="606.254">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    For certain purposes --
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="606.254" stopTime="606.471">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="606.471" stopTime="608.826">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- not for purposes of implementing the Erie doctrine.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="608.826" stopTime="612.817">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    That's right and I say the same thing about remedy in this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="612.817" stopTime="626.719">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right. 
    So -- all I'm suggesting is that -- that remedy is the most treacherous concept to be using in this particular problem because you have to say, "Yes, remedy for service purposes would not without that."
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="626.719" stopTime="632.397">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, that's right, Your Honor, but we haven't found any way to get around the -- around the use of the term remedy.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="632.397" stopTime="638.758">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I thought the New York -- the Guarantee Trust Company tried to indicate that it gets you nowhere in those (Inaudible)
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="638.758" stopTime="642.315">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="642.315" stopTime="646.316">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's what we've got here. 
    We've got an Erie purpose here, haven't we?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="646.316" stopTime="651.836">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Yes, but you also have the question of whether Vermont and New York law applies. 
    And that -- that's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="651.836" stopTime="653.128">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a different question and --
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="653.128" stopTime="653.436">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="653.436" stopTime="657.241">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- from that -- on that belief conflict --
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="657.241" stopTime="657.441">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="657.441" stopTime="671.749">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- will be to call the state courts to say I couldn't get any by going to the Vermont cases, and sending to the New York cases because New York and Vermont, both the common law jurisdiction and the common law is that the New York Court of Appeals said it was, isn't that right?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="671.749" stopTime="691.116">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I'm not relying solely on New York. 
    We have the Shafer case from Ohio, and then there are quite a number of other cases involving some decisions of this Court which followed that same principle.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="691.116" stopTime="728.425">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well now, I assume -- assuming you're right -- assuming -- don't worry about the conflict problems, so called, and that a situation where Vermont says, "This kind of -- this question Vermont thought wouldn't deal remedy," we can't have this remedy in the sort of jury non-proper prejudice. 
    And we come to our federal problem. 
    Namely, is this the kind of thing by which the substantive law is enforced to take that remedy and therefore, the federal court on its own, (Inaudible) or resource to the remedy or must have take over from the State?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="728.425" stopTime="728.541">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="728.541" stopTime="730.949">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="730.949" stopTime="893.266">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    We think that the Wilco cases, the primary answer to that, that it certainly does substantially affect the result. 
    And I'd like to read just a few lines from the opinion. 
    This Court there said, “In unrestricted submission such as the present margin agreements envisage, the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject in federal courts to judicial review for error and interpretation." 
    And then a little later, they went on and referring to the Boyd case, they said, “We said in that case that the right to select the forum even after the creation of a liability as a substantial right and that the agreement restricting the choice would forth the expressed purpose of that statute.” 
    Now, in other words, I interpret that as meaning that in a situation which is rather similar, this right to choose a forum, and in that case it was a right to choose between a court of law and arbitrators, there's a substantial right in the Guaranty Trust sense. 
    And for that reason, the Court in that case refused to enforce arbitration. 
    Now, in your dissent there, as I understand it, you drew an analogy between the speedy trial of these people that contracted for and the tortuous conduct of cases in the State of New York where the dockets are crowded. 
    And in Vermont, I don't want to belabor the term policy, but in Vermont let us say there isn't any economic necessity for substituting this arbitration which gives you sort of half a loaf, but faster for regular trial by court and jury with all the rules of evidence that assure a correct answer but take longer. 
    Actually, in Vermont, it wouldn't take any longer.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="893.266" stopTime="938.316">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me put this to you in view of that consideration of yours. 
    For purposes of argument, suppose the question had come up in the reverse, so as Vermont having arbitration law allows them and the New York didn't. 
    Now, this was removed to the New York, to the Southern District of New York where the calendar has been what denotes to them as you have been in -- in some considerable extent of what it is. 
    Would -- would the consideration that you advance the opposite of which that they have prevailed irrelevant to be -- in this matter to be determined by state of the calendar for one thing, is that relevant continuation?

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    By analogy to these New York cases, I think if we appeared before the Arbitration Commission, we'd be in the same position as if both parties had voluntarily appeared before the New York court. 
    And in other words, we'd be submitting ourselves to the jurisdiction of New York and -- and so then the law --

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well -- well, I'm not sure but I think we'd be stuck with it. 
    The -- the contract provided for the jurisdiction of the New York courts.

    But the -- it didn't provide the exclusive jurisdiction.

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    No, I don't think so because it didn't provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York courts. 
    And as I understand that provision, it simply means that if either party goes before the New York court, the other party will be bound by the decision. 
    But in this case, both parties went into the Vermont court and that question hasn't arisen.

    I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1208.764" stopTime="1226.842">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because I talk in saying that arbitration relates to remedy. 
    Well, the point of that case is that New York disregarded a -- wouldn't enforce a provision we challenge to the court. 
    That -- that's the heart of that case which -- which to me is a little medieval.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="1226.842" stopTime="1277.898">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I think Your Honor that you really have to read a string of cases there. 
    After the Mitcham case, there was Berkowitz case where they had a very interesting situation of two contracts providing for arbitration. 
    Both contracts made before the statute was enacted and an action on one of them was begun before the statute was enacted, and the other was begun after the statute was enacted. 
    And in that case, Cardozo held that this thing being a matter of remedy, that they would enforce arbitration in the second case because the lawsuit was begun after the action, after the statute was passed, but they would not enforce it in their first case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1277.898" stopTime="1306.271">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But why -- what -- what is the significance? 
    What's the importance of calling it a matter of remedy? 
    I don't understand it. 
    Suppose it was called only to substantive law as in Mitcham and reach the same result, wouldn't they? 
    Party said by agreements to decide by what substantive law contract it governed, it -- it -- wouldn't that undo it for purposes to decide and other rights should be enforced?
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="1306.271" stopTime="1320.748">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, my understanding is that in the Mitcham case, the substantive law of Ohio where the contract was drawn -- I think the contract was drawn in Ohio for performance and --

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Both parties were Pennsylvania parties and performance was to be in Pennsylvania. 
    And well, they wanted to enforce the Pennsylvania statute at any rate. 
    As I understand that, his theory was that since this was a matter of -- of remedy, the law of the forum applied. 
    And if it had been a matter of -- of substance, then the law either at the place of performance or of contracting would apply. 
    I'm not sure which.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1356.368" stopTime="1373.008">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that's the New York -- derives that, is that the New York law? 
    Am I just supposing that that's the New York law that it's -- and probably more important to decide whether, although the contract was made in New York, it looks the performance in Vermont and therefore, we've got a conflict problem.
speaker="manfred_w_ehrich_jr" startTime="1373.008" stopTime="1390.519">
    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, I don't think you get to the conflict between performance and where the contract was made because I think that the rule that governs here is where the lawsuit is brought. 
    And that this is a matter of --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1390.519" stopTime="1402.529">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where the lawsuit is brought? 
    The answer to what the Court does where the lawsuit is brought, the public attorney on what side of his rights and remedies and liabilities to be enforced.

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. 
    Well, and I think there's a distinction, Your Honor, between remedial matters and substantive matters.

    Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr.

    In the Cohen case, the Court said what the Erie Railroad Company v.

speaker="joseph_a_mcnamara" startTime="2038.384" stopTime="2159.713">
    Mr. Joseph A. McNamara 
    Your Honors, may it please the Court. 
    We feel that the contract itself here is very important in determining whether or not we have a right to a stay with the Circuit Court in this manner ordered. 
    Now as has been stated, both parties to this contract were residents of the State in New York at the time the contract was drawn and executed. 
    It contemplated and the contract was drawn in New York as well. 
    The contract contemplated that the petitioner here would go to Vermont on at least some has served since the major part of it probably. 
    The contract is executed on August 1st, 1952 and about that day, the petitioner did remove to Vermont. 
    His employment continued only until the end of October -- towards the end of October when he was dismissed or the relation of his duties as he claim. 
    That was in 1952, and in February of this year, the petitioner started his breach of contract action in the county court in Bennington County, and was removed by us to the federal court by reason of diversity. 
    We filed our answer indicating that we denied his rights to recover on the breach and set up a counterclaim showing damage to the respondent here of substantially the same and surmount as is was claimed by the petitioner. 
    At about that same date, we proceeded under the contract provisions to institute arbitration proceedings in New York through respondent's New York counsel, that was instituted and service made upon the petitioner here. 
    Following that --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="2159.713" stopTime="2161.577">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    No dispute about service?
speaker="joseph_a_mcnamara" startTime="2161.577" stopTime="2162.919">
    Mr. Joseph A. McNamara 
    There is no dispute about service.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="2162.919" stopTime="2164.323">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    You served in New York?
speaker="joseph_a_mcnamara" startTime="2164.323" stopTime="2341.944">
    Mr. Joseph A. McNamara 
    We are -- yes. 
    And the -- we served under the New York statute which prevent -- permits service by registered mail. 
    And that was done and proper bond, filed it under standards, no question for proper arbitration proceedings were instituted in New York. 
    Very shortly there afterwards, the day or two later, we moved for a stay in the District Court to permit us to continue with the arbitration. 
    That matter was heard and the Court denied it, not our motion for stay on the ground, the Court held that Erie-Tompkins did control here, and we filed our appeal which was heard by the Second Circuit. 
    And that Circuit in the unanimous opinion ruled that we were entitled for the stay. 
    Certiorari was then allowed here and that brings us to this present point. 
    Now, I think unimportant to call the Court's attention, I think this may as we conceive it be decisible, this whole issue. 
    And that is that when the contract is drawn and executed, there was inserted therein paragraph 11, “The parties hereto -- hereto do here agree that any differences claimed, no matter a dispute arise between them out of this agreement or connected herewith shall be submitted by them to arbitration by the American Arbitration Society or its successor. 
    And that the determination of said American Arbitration Association or its successors or any arbitrators appointed -- designated by the said association on such matters shall be final and absolute.” 
    And then it goes on to say that the arbitration shall be conducted under the pertinent sections of the New York Civil Practice Act relating to arbitration. 
    But a further provision that we consider very important is paragraph 14 of the contract, and that is as follows. 
    "In short the parties hereto do hereby stipulate and agree, that is their intention and covenant that this agreement forums hereunder. 
    And all suits and special proceedings hereunder, be construed in accordance with and under and pursuant to the laws of the State of New York. 
    And that many special -- any actions, special proceeding, or other proceeding that may be brought arising out of or in connection with over reasons of agreement, the laws of the State of New York shall be applicable and shall govern to the exclusion of the law of any other forum without regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or special proceeding may be instituted. 
    Those two sections appear on page 9 of our brief.

speaker="joseph_a_mcnamara" startTime="2469.749" stopTime="2963.024">
    Mr. Joseph A. McNamara 
    Yes. 
    But we say that -- that those two clauses of the contract are very pertinent here. 
    Now, the -- my brothers have been asked by Justice Frankfurter and others as to whether or not we had any lower court rulings determining how matters of this nature would be handled. 
    In the first case to come before the New York courts on this was the Marchant against Mead-Morrison Company and decided by the New York Court of Appeals in 1929 after the determination after the passing of the arbitration statute in New York. 
    Now, that was a case in which a main corporation contracted to sell and deliver tractors to a New York corporation. 
    The contract is executed in Massachusetts. 
    The tractors were to be manufactured and delivered to Massachusetts, and the contract contained an arbitration clause. 
    It doesn't set up in the arbitration clause that it was the arbitrations to be under the New York state law. 
    Now, that was brought -- arbitration was sought in that case in the courts of New York and the Court of Appeals had the following question, “Did the Supreme Court or judge there power -- have power under Section 4 of the New York law to appoint a third arbitrator? 
    It appears that their arbitration agreement called for each party to appoint an arbitrator, and those two were to appoint a third. 
    But each party did appoint an arbitrator and they couldn't agree upon the third, and they appealed to the Court of New York to have the third one appointed. 
    And the Court did appoint the third arbitrator, and objection was made there to the seller, the one who didn't want the arbitration in New York, attack the legality of the order on two grounds. 
    On the first point, argues that the arbitration provision as quoted above provided for arbitration in Massachusetts and nowhere else. 
    And therefore, New York had no power to act under Section 4 of the New York Arbitration Act. 
    Judge Cardozo wrote the opinion in that case, and if I may quote from the latter part of one paragraph. 
    Judge Cardozo said, "This remedy may lawfully be extended to contracts of manufacture made in Massachusetts and there to be performed unless it is one of the terms of arbitration clause implied if not expressed that the arbitration shall proceed in a -- in a particular locality.” 
    Express restriction there is none in the contract now before us, whether one as to be implied is the question of intention to determine in the light of the context annotation. 
    This is what was done. 
    The Court discharged of its judicial function was called upon to declare the implications of the promise. 
    We do not say at this time the determination is free from error and not for the present purposes that is not to be ignored as void. 
    In other words, and in that case, the constitutionality of the New York Arbitration Act was gone into and rather determined by Judge Cardozo. 
    Now, there, serious case where case where the only connection that any of the parties or any of the agreement had to New York in the actual contract is a fact that one of the parties was a New York corporation. 
    We have the next case in the matter of Gant and the situation of parties in the terms of arbitration or as follows that both parties were at all times none resident of New York. 
    The arbitration provision called for arbitration in New York. 
    That was the -- one of the parties was a resident in North Carolina and the other was in Nicaraguan company, and a disagreement arose and the Nicaraguan company sought arbitration in New York. 
    The Gant didn't reply but petition for a stay of the arbitration in New York, that's the North Carolina party. 
    He argued the law on that -- of -- under the law of North Carolina, arbitration provision was void and therefore the New York courts could not force him to arbitrate. 
    The trial court and the Court of Appeals found that the arbitration was not void, it was merely voidable in North Carolina, and his petition for a stay of the arbitration proceedings was denied and the arbitration was carried out. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals in its decision used this language, “The place of performance of the arbitration section, though not other parts of the September agreement was to be in New York.” 
    New York statute, that's the Civil Practice Act in Section -- paragraph 84, provides complete compulsion and full enforcement as to such promises to arbitrate future-arising disputes. 
    And apparently on the strength of that, that was the nub of their decision in that case. 
    And further they said, some of the parties solemnly promise to arbitrate their controversies in New York. 
    And by a case in statute law of New York then was and now is that such an agreement is a consent of the parties thereto to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of this State to enforce such contract for such submission. 
    Now, that of course is less strong than the case before the Court here. 
    Then there's one other case that is reported without opinion in which there were two New York corporations, also is in New York, entered a commercial contract in New York and had a -- an arbitration provision in their contract. 
    Later, both parties moved to Connecticut, dispute arose, one party petitioned for arbitration in New York and the other party moved for a stay of the arbitration proceedings because a civil case had been commenced in Connecticut. 
    The Court denied that motion, ordered arbitration to proceed and said that even though the case was pending in Connecticut, there was nothing inconsistent in there allowing arbitration since that was the sense of the contract and the agreement made by the party. 
    The judge said in so rolling, called the contract in 1936 was made this day by New York corporations therefore has consent to the jurisdiction of this Court to enforce the contract.” 
    Now briefly, your -- that covers our situation to their brief, some other matters here but here we have two New York parties contracting to arbitrate under the laws of the State of New York, and that all the laws of the State of New York would apply to their contract regardless of whatever the law might be of any other forum. 
    We say that by reason of that, the District Court of Vermont should have and was required to allow our petition and grant our motion because the Court in Vermont should be, as the New York case have held, bound by the contract into which the parties entered. 
    And if the -- the -- since the arbitration had been commenced that we were entitled to the stay to permit completion of the arbitration.

   Argument of Guy M. Page, Jr.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3686.324" stopTime="3729.875">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I have been -- been listening to this last colloquy between Mr. McNamara and the Court. 
    Now, I think we ought to -- we ought to get it clear that we're dealing with -- with the two different kinds of situations here. 
    When we went into federal court, we went in, in reliance upon the construction of Section 3 which the Second Circuit had announced. 
    It's a construction of some 20 years of standing. 
    And the construction clearly made Section 3 applicable to our case and that was so under that construction without regard to whether we got in under Section 2 so that we would have had Section 4 remedies.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3729.875" stopTime="3737.318">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean the opinion by Judge Hand? 
    When you say the Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit, what do you imply?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3737.318" stopTime="3741.141">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    We had in mind the -- the --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3741.141" stopTime="3743.880">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It was very good.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3743.880" stopTime="3745.584">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    And that's -- and hardly say now.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3745.584" stopTime="3747.856">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3747.856" stopTime="3820.441">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I think it was Judge Hand in the Shanferoke case that started the ball rolling on the -- the disassociation of Section 3 from the rest of the Act. 
    That was picked up by Judge Goodrich, who -- who expressly held that Section 3 was disassociated and I believe there's another opinion in there. 
    But that did seem to be and as we studied those cases on, we felt and we apparently were vindicated in that feeling that the Second Circuit would make that construction of the Act. 
    Now, assuming that that is the construction which stands, that Section 3 is broadened up to touch this case or that this case would fit into Section 3 on any construction then we're faced to a one kind of problem of how much state law we're going to absorb under the Erie rule. 
    Now, somewhere, there's a limit to the amount of state law which gets absorbed into the federal court and we think that that limit certainly is reached where Congress has enacted a specific method of the federal courts doing their business as they have in the Arbitration Act. 
    Now, that's one situation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3820.441" stopTime="3840.809">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they must be careful about that because have -- so many justices found that opinion in the Erie case over on the ground and why all the -- why your swift -- why swift enticing was declared illegal and unconstitutional, although it's been there for nearly 100 years, was because even Congress couldn't even follow.

    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    We appreciate that it's a constitutional problem, and undoubtedly, there is some restriction from the power of Commerce for Congress to legislate a procedure for the federal courts. 
    We just don't think it's reached with the Federal Arbitration Act.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3862.066" stopTime="3876.741">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It may -- rather than to be said, it may not be only clear that Congress even acted to that constitutional problem that such would be by directing that it should be applied to diversity cases.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's right, quite. 
    I'm saying you have to answer that before you come to the constitutional problem that you've given an answer and that's properly enough.

    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3897.632" stopTime="3912.417">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the first question is whether Congress in the Arbitration Act didn't pass that in the statute and we have ample scope for litigation or arguing under federal rights. 
    So the Red Line cases, the case is foreign that we have for admiralty matters.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3912.417" stopTime="3921.817">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I wonder if that isn't a case about admiralty law and not a case about -- about arbitration. 
    But the emphasis --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3921.817" stopTime="3931.642">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But even though it required vast decision to allow arbitration even in the hypothetic cases because of the general doctrine against ousting jurisdiction, isn't that right?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3931.642" stopTime="3953.315">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    Well, let's see. 
    I understand that admiralty case, that Red Cross case. 
    That the New York Court of Appeals doubted its own power to invade the federal domain to the extent of giving this remedy, this machinery for enforcing federally created rights or rights that originated in the federal domain.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3953.315" stopTime="3961.434">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the reason why it was that it -- it would be -- is the common law reason against ousting courts in a case.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3961.434" stopTime="3968.865">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I'm just not familiar with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on that. 
    I only know the result and I know that this Court didn't go along with that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3968.865" stopTime="3969.853">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's right.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="3969.853" stopTime="4032.339">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    They said that -- well, the State of New York has got some -- something to do in admiralty fields and this one of the things they could do. 
    But I don't think that that is really germane to the issue we're dealing with here. 
    The language is -- worries us of course. 
    But the point I was making now is we've got one problem when we're dealing with an act of Congress which has something to say about the way the federal courts are run, that is arbitration or not. 
    And we have quite a different situation if that act of Congress, for some reason, doesn't apply on this case, and there, we suspect that the amount of state law that's going to be absorbed is quite a good deal or more. 
    We think that's the -- that's the teaching of the York case that you've got to come up with a substantial result. 
    And if there's one thing that all four counsel agree with here, it's that -- that arbitration is -- does substantially affect the result within the meaning of the York case. 
    Now, I want to go back again to just what this New York --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4032.339" stopTime="4034.971">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) can't agree on that.

    All right.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4043.600" stopTime="4139.600">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    Now, I want to go back to just what this agreement is that we're dealing with. 
    We -- we feel that this -- this contract that's here being -- being construed, this breach of contract question as before the Court has got nothing to do with these old Vermont cases. 
    These were all domestic submissions. 
    They were -- they were matters which were submitted to arbitration for some reason or other. 
    There was a revocation which apparently satisfied the counsel that it had been an effective revocation. 
    And so, the -- the submission was a dead letter as far as affecting the resolution of the differences in court. 
    And that's all in the world those cases have anything to do with, they aren't our case. 
    This would be a case of first impression in Vermont. 
    As a matter of fact, we think it's a case of first impression here in this Court too. 
    So we think the Vermont cases such as they are have nothing to do with it. 
    Now, if I were under Vermont subject, I think I have heard in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's questions a suggestion that perhaps there is some burning local issue here which ought to be adjudicated for the first time in the Vermont court. 
    I don't think there is. 
    I think if you stop 9 out of 10 lawyers on the streets of Burlington and asked them what they thought about arbitration, they wouldn't have an opinion. 
    They wouldn't care much. 
    I've seen it once or twice in the local agreements but as far as whether the states barred or against it, and whether our courts work fast enough without the assistance of this extraordinary forum, I never heard the matter discussed except in connection with this particular case that we've been engaged in.

    I think it would take quite a long time. 
    I don't believe that the federal court opted staying from deciding this case on the ground that it's Vermont's business. 
    We really think it's a question which -- and we suspect the granting of certiorari here suggest that this Court feels that it affects a lot people -- a lot of people other than the ones involved in this case. 
    And if I had to make a guess, I would say people on -- in Vermont whereas little affected by it as -- as almost any people I could think of in the United States.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, if we left the whole problem of arbitration for a moment and thought of what the law in Vermont was as to the interpretation and enforceability of contracts made in another States, governed by the law of the other States according to the language of contract, then were drawn in Vermont. 
    Have we any light on that?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4231.283" stopTime="4267.740">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think there is a little bit. 
    Certainly, our basic proposition up there is the lex loci governance, and that's nothing unique to our State. 
    There is more or less by happens stands one case here as in years ago where our court found occasion to remark the -- the law in governing an arbitration bond. 
    I think there, the matter had gone through to award and it was an action on the bond. 
    And they made some remark to the effect that the matter governing this arbitration business was -- was the law of Canada.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="4267.740" stopTime="4272.233">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    But the -- the lex loci is there -- there, the law ordinarily enforced in Vermont?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4272.233" stopTime="4285.926">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I don't think there's any question about it. 
    There's no special gimmicks on the Vermont law there, they are few cases involving it. 
    There are some -- some language in the cases which say that the parties -- which suggest the parties --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="4285.926" stopTime="4289.276">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Have you -- have you discussed that question?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4289.276" stopTime="4421.105">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    We have not perhaps discussed to it as extensively as we should have. 
    I've got here on page 37 of -- of the respondent's brief. 
    We mentioned three cases there. 
    This Woodrow v. O'Conner is that old arbitration bond case. 
    And then there were a couple of cases more recent which suggests the parties can -- can have something to say about the applicable law. 
    By the way, they write their contract. 
    I did put in that Brown v. Perry case on this business of public policy. 
    I have a suspicion that some of the inquiries made by the Court on that are -- are whimsical in part as to whether or not we have a strong animus against arbitration. 
    If we have, I've never heard of it. 
    Here in this Brown v. Perry case, the Court laid down its rule, the rule for guidance when it's dealing with a statue of another State. 
    And I think it's worthy of quotation, ”A Court should not -- this is a Vermont Court speaking, “In otherwise proper cases refuse to apply the law of a foreign State, however unlike it's own, unless it is contrary to pure morals or abstract justice or unless the enforcement would be an evil example and harmful to its own people.” 
    The statute of another state is not contrary to public policy merely because it's materially different from our own or because we have no statute on the subject. 
    Now, if there's any question of pure morals or abstract justice involved here, I suspect our court would take a view that a fellow ought not to have it made easy for him to welch on an agreement. 
    But we think that's -- if there is any moral question involved then it's along those lines rather than this -- this ousting the court of jurisdiction. 
    There's a case back -- this fits in the old general law category back in 1918. 
    As a matter of fact, it's the principle authority for the quotation was Biehl. 
    There's a case that a man named Hough wrote -- wrote the opinion in the Southern District of New York.

    That he there said that -- that he had to follow the United States Supreme Court because he was a federal judge, and he would follow this old revocability cases which are matters of general law. 
    He said that in the last paragraph.But before saying that, he took 8 or 10 pages to excoriate this revocability rule, and we'd -- we'd cite that to the Vermont court if we had had -- we were put to it on this business of the pure morals and abstract justice and that sort of thing.

    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    No, sir that's -- well, I think perhaps I should explain why we did not. 
    We went into Federal District Court and we had some briefing done on that. 
    It isn't as thorough as we've gotten into later because of the time limitations. 
    And I got about partway through it and that the Court told me he didn't take much of my ideas. 
    So then we switched over --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4520.122" stopTime="4521.764">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did he say that just like that?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4521.764" stopTime="4524.527">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    Well, I can't remember his exact words, but he made it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4524.527" stopTime="4526.062">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    More gentle, I suppose.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="4526.062" stopTime="4765.498">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    Well, pretty much along those lines. 
    So at any rate, I thought I'd better switch over into the federal statute into that. 
    And we thought we're on pretty good ground on that federal statute, and the Court of Appeals thought we were. 
    But we don't -- the granting of certiorari here, we thought we better go back to some of these matters which are -- are independent of the statute. 
    And that's why our brief reads the way it does in this Court. 
    This -- I want to go back again on this business of exactly what the contract is we're dealing with because I think that's how you get -- that's the answer to these cases in that particular contract that was made. 
    Now, Mr. McNamara started to read that up, so it's a pretty good idea that we're construing an agreement to have the agreement here before us. 
    "The parties hereto do agree that any differences, claim, or matter in dispute arising between them out of this agreement or connected herewith shall be submitted by them to arbitration, by the American Arbitration Association or its successor. 
    And that the determination of the American Arbitration Association or its successors or any arbitrators designated by said association on such matters shall be final and absolute. 
    The said arbitrator shall be governed by the duly promulgated rules and regulations, the American Arbitration Association or its successor and the pertinent provisions of the Civil Practice Act for the State of New York relating to arbitrations. 
    The decision of the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment in any court of the State of New York or elsewhere." 
    And in this fourteenth article, they expressly incorporate this New York law in the agreement. 
    So this contract embodied this New York doctrine as a part of it. 
    And these provisions, Section 1450, of course we have the basic provision in Section 1448 which says that these agreements shall hereafter be valid, enforceable, and irrevocable. 
    Now, the legislature conceivably could have put a period to the statute right there and that would have been the end of it. 
    That I guess, everyone would say that sounds pretty substantive and we might not be arguing this remedy business. 
    Well, they didn't do that in order to implement this declaration that it was valid, enforceable, and irrevocable. 
    They went ahead and provided that when you make an agreement in New York, you consent in advance to the jurisdiction of the New York -- the courts over your person, so that you can't defeat the agreement by leaving the State. 
    They provided for a stay in Section 1451, not exactly the same stay we're asking for but a stay under their statutes. 
    In 1452, they gave the power to name an arbitrator and that stops all this chicanery of writings for scratching every name off the list that's submitted to you so that you can put it off indefinitely. 
    1461, they said that this award could become a judgment. 
    In 1466, they said it will have the same force and effect as a judgement. 
    The cases which have come up under the statute amply are a fruition of these provisions. 
    There is the -- the Marsh case, a Massachusetts contract made in Massachusetts. 
    Performance of the container contracts certainly at Massachusetts. 
    Nothing said about the place of performance of the arbitration clause and main in New York parties. 
    The New York Court of Appeals had no difficulty in saying that this thing should be enforced according to its terms, and they presented a moving party with a judgement which was entitled the full faith and credit in other States. 
    But there has incidentally been since the Shafer v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, so far as I know, there has been no -- no quarrel about the effect of these ex parte awards.

    I -- somewhere in our brief here toward the end, we have taken the position that there isn't any more federal general law of arbitration. 
    That stuff is all gone with Erie. 
    And when this -- these things --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5205.832" stopTime="5207.750">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)

    Well, that they --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5208.847" stopTime="5210.523">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There isn't a general law of it.
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="5210.523" stopTime="5367.117">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    There isn't any general law doctrine such as Judge Hough applied in the Trinidad case that the old Supreme Court cases are no longer authority because there isn't any federal common law anymore. 
    All of the cases which have come in thus far into federal courts since the Erie case, I think all of them have involved the Arbitration Act. 
    And this expansion of Section 3 has really displaced the -- the ordinary diversity case in the federal court. 
    They -- they do the same thing that they did in our case as we ask them to. 
    They apply the Federal Acts so you don't at least get -- they haven't really gotten into this Erie stuff. 
    Now, what happens when you get a -- and it's bound to come up sooner or later, particularly the uniformed commissioners enact this law, are successful in getting it enacted in more states. 
    What happens when you have these cases coming into the federal courts and into the state courts in the conflict of law situations? 
    Brother Ehrich is not too far wrong when he says about the only authority on it are things like Biehl. 
    And incidentally, Mr. Biehl doesn't think much of the rule. 
    He refers to it as a lot of chicanery I think. 
    And cases like the Shafer-Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer which is as dead as the dodo bird in its own state just as the Mitcham case, it's dead as the dodo bird in New York State. 
    That's all the law there is on this subject or just about all the law. 
    This 153 case in Pennsylvania where for some reason, they couldn't qualify under the Pennsylvania Act and with that opinion. 
    I can't understand what they said, but I know what they did. 
    They went ahead and stayed the action. 
    But more or less by analogy to what they would have done if their own Act applied and by analogy to what the New York State would have done. 
    But we think if this Court and I don't know how much attention people would pay to the Vermont Supreme Court if it made this distinction, but we think if this Court identifies the New York agreement embodying as it does in this statute as suspending the rights of the parties to a common law determination, to a determination of the common law courts and substituting their perspective arbitration award as their right. 
    We think that if that identification of the contract was made, then all these conflict of jurisdiction stuff will earn itself out. 
    Everyone can then think in terms of lex loci and lex fori and -- if there's no more trouble.

    Was the Vermont law presented to the Court of Appeals?

    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    I -- Mr. McNamara argued that, I didn't. 
    Fred Ehrich have presented something along those lines, but we took the position that the statute was all --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="5479.069" stopTime="5481.182">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Or you needed the rights of the federal statute?
speaker="guy_m_page_jr" startTime="5481.182" stopTime="5544.849">
    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    That was the position we took there. 
    We think this -- but just to close here, we think that this stay that we are asking for is not the New York contract stay. 
    It's a plea in the nature of a plea to suspend the operation of the petitioner's lawsuit until such time as his rights are fully matured by obtaining the arbitration award. 
    We think that's the thing he really has to sue on, is the arbitration award when and if he gets it. 
    And that our plea for a stay is -- is merely to get that award. 
    There is a couple of Vermont cases where they say that the proper thing for a court to do is to stay a pending action or is to stay the -- the reported action when there is another pending action that's going to get rid of all the problems. 
    It's going to make everything res judicata or collateral estoppel. 
    They simply stopped that second action and awaiting until the first one is finished and they do that by a stay procedure. 
    So --

    Mr. Guy M. Page, Jr. 
    We -- we feel exactly the same way here we did about Section 3 in the Circuit. 
    Putting aside Section 3, we think this thing ought to be entitled a full faith and credit. 
    We say that the public acts of New York are so much an integral part of the contract that the -- that the contract itself is entitled a full faith and credit in Vermont. 
    We think once this is done then all these monkey business will be over right there and that's -- that's the end of the matter right there and no more problems. 
    So that is our main position.

    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    Yes. 
    The Vermont law as to what -- as to the enforceability of arbitration agreement was specifically decided by Judge Gibson. 
    In fact, he was so certain of the law himself that he asked counsel if they would be willing to concede that Vermont law was as we said it was and they did. 
    And so we did not argue that question orally other than a few preliminary statements before he made a statement. 
    Judge Gibson, a federal judge, a Vermont lawyer sitting in Vermont, made an express finding on that matter of Vermont law.

    The matters of the conflicts problems which you are asking about now were briefed by both parties extensively at the District Court level.

    Now, the District Court, perhaps unfortunately because the problem that's now raised here didn't expressly rule on the conflicts argument. 
    He seemed to dispose of the whole thing in a -- in a package statement with reference to the Erie doctrine.

speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="5839.617" stopTime="6009.589">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    If the Court please, as I said, there are three aspects. 
    I'm trying to dispose of the first one first because I think that that's the most easily disposed off. 
    That's the question of what is the Vermont law on arbitration agreements, not the conflicts question which you raise nor the full faith and credit question which can be discussed following that if I may. 
    The Vermont law is settled. 
    Now, Vermont courts aren't given the (Inaudible) 
    They made no statement that arbitration was a horrendous thing. 
    They merely stated the law as they found it at that time. 
    I take that to mean a statement of policy. 
    There might be very many factors that might have determined what the policy would be at that time. 
    It has been accepted by -- as the counsel for the other side is as the Vermont law all these years by Vermont lawyers. 
    And Judge Gibson thought it was so well settled that he didn't even ask for argument on the question. 
    We feel that this policy question has some relation to the full faith and credit issue however, and we do feel that it is important that this Court not try to remake the law for Vermont under the guise of full faith and credit merely because it doesn't find a shattered statement in the Vermont Supreme Court as to why they rule the way they do on arbitration agreement. 
    Now, in the very case which they have cited at length with regard to the view of Vermont case of conflicting policies, the Brown against Perry case, I should point out that in that case, it involves an application of the Hew Hampshire wrongful death action, if I remember rightly, in Vermont courts. 
    Now, Vermont had a wrong -- wrongful death statute at the same time. 
    There was no conflict of policy there as such but in fact, the people who won in that case won a pyrrhic victory in a way because the reason they wanted the New Hampshire statute was because the measure of damages was much broader. 
    It include pain and suffering of the decedent. 
    And at that time, all Vermont permitted was loss to the next of keen, pecuniarily loss to the next of keen. 
    And it is a striking fact that the Court in that Brown against Perry case decided that, "Yes, we apply the Vermont -- the New Hampshire statue in Vermont as to wrongful death. 
    But the measure of damages being a matter of remedy, we apply." 
    So that people that won that appeal were nothing because in fact, the measure of damages is probably what they were concerned for.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6009.589" stopTime="6012.477">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was that decided by Vermont on Vermont conflicts law in full faith and --

    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    That was decided by Vermont.

speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6022.598" stopTime="6039.711">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    But it was a conflicts decision obviously and it did state that this a matter of remedy, the measure of damages. 
    Now, whether the measure of damages is every -- in view of everybody, I don't know. 
    I think that -- that remedy is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6039.711" stopTime="6040.033">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suppose --
speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6040.033" stopTime="6045.902">

    -- a useful distinction under some circumstances but it obviously is a fighting word in many cases.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6045.902" stopTime="6076.311">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. -- Mr. Clark, I suppose if you had a Vermont statute which for certain, (Inaudible) is double damages and the suit was then further moved to the federal court. 
    I should think anybody would have a hard time arguing with the measure of damages as a matter of remedy. 
    And therefore, the federal court would apply the old remedy and therefore the Government and its provisions, the Vermont statute doesn't apply.

    He did said that Vermont law did not permit the enforcement of arbitration agreements. 
    That the contract was then --

    Yes.

    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    But, he did not mention in his position -- in his opinion New York law. 
    That was all presented to him in argument in the courts.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6119.690" stopTime="6139.836">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Certainly, he didn't mention it in is his opinion but when he held on page 17 that there was no statutory law governing arbitration, common law must apply. 
    The common law is an agreement to submit an issue of arbitration is not binding, it is not revocable at anytime and then enforce this. 
    He was enforcing this particular contract made in New York.
speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6139.836" stopTime="6152.838">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    That's correct. 
    That is correct. 
    I think that the conflicts rule is implicit because it was necessary to his decision in the first place.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6152.838" stopTime="6162.055">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, he had to do that because he gave his second question -- he is deciding upon it of that and be contracted to a just contracted dispute by arbitration and then you said they haven't.
speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6162.055" stopTime="6171.862">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    If he had expressly said I also decide the conflicts issue and then made a ruling on that and then applied the Erie to it with facts and against the dissenter and all that --

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, he goes through. 
    I -- I suppose the Court of Appeals went the other way.

    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    The Court of Appeals apparently went on the Murray against -- Murray against Mitsui case.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="6183.554" stopTime="6199.415">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Yes, if -- if it is necessary to decide the Vermont law in order to keep this from being arbitrated in Vermont, it was necessary for the Court of Appeals to decide it contrary as to Vermont law for it to go to stay in New York law.
speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6199.415" stopTime="6216.382">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    No, they decided the -- entirely on the basis of federal statute, saying merely a form of trial something which is within federal jurisdiction and subject to the power of the federal courts -- of the Congress to control through their control of procedure in federal court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6216.382" stopTime="6218.746">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They held that the Erie and Tompkins doctrine didn't apply?
speaker="eugene_v_clark" startTime="6218.746" stopTime="6250.605">
    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    That is right. 
    That's exactly what they decided, and we of course disagree very strenuously for -- with that. 
    But on the other hand, I gather that counsel have already agreed possibly in view of the Wilco case that this is a type of -- of situation which would substantially affect the result. 
    And perhaps the Court isn't willing to let it go on concession of counsel. 
    I'd be willing to address myself to that further if you feel that that's necessary.

    Mr. Eugene V. Clark 
    In this matter of Gant decision which they also rely on in New York's Court of Appeals. 
    The New York case said specifically, "We treat this matter of enforceability as a matter of remedy, and they expressly rejected order of Travelers against Wolfe as being applicable and is requiring full faith and credit. 
    They said we, however, do not think that that decision wipes out the old rule that remedies including arbitration are regulated by the law of the forum. 
    Now in summary, I think that this case has to --
