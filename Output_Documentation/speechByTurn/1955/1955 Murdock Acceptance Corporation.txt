    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 56, Murdock Acceptance Corporation versus United States of America. 
    Now, Mrs. Grayson, you may proceed.
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="39.563" stopTime="409.294">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is before this Court on certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    It arises out of the seizure of an automobile as violating the statute against a vehicle transporting whiskey without tax on it which is Section 26 U.S.C.A. 3321. 
    A petition was -- for remission was filed by the Murdock Acceptance Corporation under Section 18 U.S.C.A. 3617. 
    The position being taken and it now being admitted that Murdock Acceptance Corporation was a good faith lienor, that it acquired its lien on this automobile in good faith with no knowledge that it would be used for the transportation of -- of liquor in any form. 
    And that it inquired its lien after an investigation and inquiry as required by the statute at the proper place and from the proper Federal law-enforcement office of the Alcohol Tax Unit. 
    That it had received form the Alcohol Tax Unit its standard form reply always used when the subject had no reputation or record for violating the liquor laws of the State -- of any state of the United States. 
    It, therefore, filed its petition as now admitted that it has complied to that extent with every phase of the statute. 
    Its petition for remission was denied by the District Judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana where the car was seized. 
    In his opinion, the District Judge stated and took the position that he had discretion regardless of the fact that the claimant had complied with the requirements of the statute as to inquiry and regardless of being a good faith lienor, that he had discretion to deny the remission. 
    An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and was -- there, the decision of the District Judge was almost summarily affirmed. 
    Now, of our own petition for rehearing, Mr. Justice Tuttle wrote a strong dissenting opinion. 
    As late as the -- as the briefs in this Court on petition for certiorari, the Government has taken the position that the discretion of that District Judge is not reviewable by this Court. 
    We have an illustration in this case of our great democracy at work and that we have here a case involving One 1951 Chevrolet which after three years of storage and the passage of time could not be worth over $500. 
    We have, however, in this case, the Murdock Acceptance Corporation which indirectly is standing before this Court on behalf of our finance company. 
    We all realized that our economy is bottomed on credit buying, that our manufacturing industry is bottomed on the continuance of that large credit buying. 
    We also realized that credit selling to continue in the course in which it is now progressing must be also bottomed on stability of its security on the knowledge that its right in two (Inaudible) will be determined by a court of law according to established principles with the right of review, not merely as done before 1936 by mercy and justice. 
    The facts in this case are quite simple. 
    It was tried on an agreed statement of facts which is only two pages in length. 
    This car was sold by -- the paper was purchased by Murdock Acceptance Corporation which is a Tennessee corporation operating in surrounding state. 
    At its Jackson, Mississippi office, it was tendered to Murdock Acceptance Corporation by a dealer and prior to acquiring the -- the paper, Murdock Acceptance Corporation made inquiry of the proposed purchaser. 
    There is no question in this case as to the type of inquiry or the wording of the inquiry. 
    The inquiry is made as to both record and reputation. 
    There is no question in this case as to the location of the inquiry. 
    The inquiry was made of the highest Federal law-enforcement office in the State of Mississippi. 
    It was made at the proper place and that it is admitted and agreed that the Jackson office, which was a statewide office, had statewide jurisdiction and the inquiry could have been made at no other place in the State of Mississippi, that had it been made in any other of the -- what they call the "field offices" which might have been a little closer to the residence of the -- of purchaser that they would have immediately been referred to the Jackson office. 
    And therefore, no question is raised by the Government as to the place of inquiry or as to -- or the office has made. 
    It is admitted that the inquiries made of the only Federal law-enforcement officer that where inquiry could have been made. 
    Then the paper was purchased upon the receipt of the following answer from the Alcohol Tax Unit. 
    And that answer was a form answer rather in the nature of bureaus and administrative bodies. 
    It was stamped on the bottom of the letter of inquiry. 
    The only blank in the answer was for the date and for the signature of the officer signing it. 
    It was the form answer admittedly used in every case where there was no record or reputation for violation of liquor laws. 
    It was -- therefore, the only answer which the Murdock could have gotten where there was no record or reputation or for violation of liquor laws, that answer contained the following languages and stated it was a stamp. 
    No record or reputation as of blank date period. 
    This office does not have a complete file of our local and state arrest and prosecutions nor does it have knowledge of what reputation that kept -- prospect might have among state officers (Voice Overlap) --

    But that was the only language on that rubber stamp but if they don't use that now, they could have another office stamp, couldn't they?

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    Sir, they could now.

    They could then, couldn't they? 
    I mean --

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    They had -- no, it is admitted, Mr. -- just the -- that that was the only one they would or could use at that time where they had no record or reputation.

    Justice Sherman Minton 
    That's the only one they did use but there's nothing on earth that prevented them from having a different form.

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    No, sir. 
    They could have -- could have prescribed and in fact we are informed now. 
    We -- though, we do not know that since this case has arisen, they have changed that form, whether it would continue, we don't know what the -- but at that time that form had been in use for we know -- I don't know how long but I know since before 1936. 
    Because that same reply had been approved by the Treasury Department and our remission had been granted by the Treasury Department on that exactly the same reply before the new statute in 1936, giving the courts exclusive jurisdiction of remission. 
    And the -- the Treasury Department, had for many years before then as -- as admitted by the Government, held that that form reply was satisfactory and sufficient and that that was -- was a reply that they had no record or reputation.
speaker="sherman_minton" startTime="486.233" stopTime="506.749">
    Justice Sherman Minton 
    There was a standard form but -- but -- that there was standard form but it made it just as vague as -- as if it hadn't been a standard form. 
    I mean the -- it is not -- it -- it didn't cover the whole field in the answer and then apparently on purpose it didn't -- didn't cover the field.
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="506.749" stopTime="561.913">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    Well, it didn't cover the field so the Government says, "Now, that is the point that we wish to discuss with Your Honor." 
    Of course they could have used another form but it is admitted that that is the only one that -- that the ATU you would give them. 
    And it is a form that they used in every case regardless whether there was no record. 
    Now, if there was a record or reputation at that office or with that headquarters, they would write, "So and so has a record in such and such a court and we understand that he -- or we think at this office that he has a reputation." 
    If he had a record or reputation that was written on -- on the bottom of the letter, if not, the stamp was used which what they intended and felt was a complete denial as complete as they would make or could make in any case. 
    If a member of this Court should happen to have bought a car on time then the inquiry would have had to be made of a member of this Court.
speaker="sherman_minton" startTime="561.913" stopTime="572.651">
    Justice Sherman Minton 
    But there is a difference between saying that there is no -- there is no reputation in saying, there is no reputation that -- that we know of and we don't know what reputation he may have somewhere else.
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="572.651" stopTime="605.344">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    The first statement in the reply was, "No record or reputation as of this day." 
    This office does not have a complete file of state arrest and we do not know what reputation the purchaser may have with state (Inaudible) 
    May we examine that -- that answer just a moment and that's what Murdock did phrase in -- in receiving the first answer. 
    These answers have been given or stated for 25 or 35 years and they've always been received in the same form.(Voice Overlap) --

    You couldn't have gotten another answer out of the bureau because that was their rule and regulation. 
    Now, let's look at that answer for just a moment. 
    It merely told the claimant what he already knew.

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    If Your Honor please, the sheriff is in the alternative as to the officers that you must make it. 
    But accumulative as to the place that you must make it, you must make it in the place of residence in the place where the transaction is closed and the sale is made and in the place where credit references were made. 
    In this instance, the credit references were all in Jackson-Hinds County. 
    The sale was consummated in Hinds County but the purchaser lived outside of Hinds County about 30 or 40 miles. 
    Now, the inquiry should have been made at each of these places. 
    However, when the inquiry is made -- can be made at any one of three and that is admitted by the Government in its brief several times and it's been held that it does not have to be made of our three officers. 
    It can be made either of the sheriff at his headquarters --

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    Yes, there's no doubt about that.

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    That's right. 
    It said it did not have a complete file, if Your Honor please, of all state arrest. 
    In other words, it didn't have some files of state arrest and it did not have information as to reputation among state officers. 
    If Your Honors please, reputation is a matter of the mind. 
    If they had -- if the ATU office had known that he had a reputation with state officers then that would have consisted or constituted a reputation at that office or with that office there. 
    Reputation is purely a matter of the mind. 
    That answer not only told them what they already knew but it was the only truthful office answer that any officer anywhere can give.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="782.885" stopTime="796.803">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What you -- what you say then as to entities that if this had been spelled out to say, "We know in this office of no federal or state violation." 
    That would have been a full compliance to the statute?
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="796.803" stopTime="1115.599">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    I think -- I think that is what they have changed to now. 
    We -- at least they used the word liquor law violator, no record or reputation as a liquor law violator and stop there. 
    I think the Government now admits that that is sufficient. 
    That we didn't have to make the inquiry anywhere except the ATU that the location was sufficient, that we didn't have to then make the shot. 
    But they -- the Government takes the position that that qualifying language is sufficient that it was not a negative language, if Your Honors please, and not only told them nothing we do not know anyway, is not only as Judge -- Mr. Justice Tuttle pointed out so brilliantly in his dissenting opinion, the only truthful answer that any officer could make. 
    Otherwise, you cannot have an officer guarantee. 
    The statute does not require that you have an officer guarantee to you. 
    He has -- and to say to you, he has no record or reputation with this office or with us and any that we know of, but we -- we know that he has none with no office or anywhere in the world with no other office. 
    No officer can be expected to guarantee that or to make such a statement. 
    Therefore, the silence at the end of the answer was merely a general statement known to the person who inquired and the only truthful statement he can make. 
    But not only that, Murdock Acceptance Corporation knew and it is admitted they knew that there were long line of cases going clear back to 1937, where the courts of every Court of Appeals where it has arisen, beginning in United States versus One Dodge in Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, 88 F.2d. 
    That inquiry only needed to be made of any one of the officers, either the sheriff's office or the ATU office or the city office. 
    And that if they had -- that purchaser had no record or reputation of liquor law violator with that office or at that office that then it was immaterial whether or not he had record or reputation with any other officers or at any other location or among any other officers. 
    That being true, what he was told by the ATU, the courts have said was immaterial that we had -- he has no record or reputation with us as a liquor law violator. 
    We just don't know what he may have -- don't guarantee that we know everything about him and that we cannot guarantee that he has none anywhere and that's all it said and under the decisions of every Court of Appeals at the time this inquiry was made, there were -- there were at least 15 or 20 decisions to that effect, then the inquiry was absolutely satisfactory and sufficient.But not only that, if the Court please, then we've come to the most outstanding, I think, admissions of the Government in this case. 
    They not only admit that -- that Murdock Acceptance Corporation was a good faith lienor with no knowledge or information whatsoever detrimental beyond that answer if that could be called detrimental. 
    That they received the only answer that would be given to them by the ATU if there was no record and the only answer that they could get from the highest Federal enforcement officer where there was no record. 
    But they also admitted that the ATU interpreted that answer as being a flat denial of any record or reputation that they intended it to be. 
    That they intended that answer to protect a claimant making an inquiry. 
    Now, the Government stands before this Court and makes those admissions. 
    We thought it did. 
    We intended it to do it. 
    They also go further and admit that for 20 years since the new statute was passed in 1936, giving the courts jurisdiction, the sufficiency of that answer has never been challenged in any court. 
    That there has been any number of District Courts who have held -- held the claimant entitled to remission, where exactly the same answer was given. 
    But after justice -- Department of Justice ever challenging the sufficiency and the answer and without it ever being questioned that they also admit that that fact was known to the -- to the Murdock Acceptance Corporation. 
    In fact, they do not deny the effectiveness of this -- certified copies we have attest in our brief of cases from the State of Mississippi where the identical answer came up in decisions not challenging that answer but where some other question was involved and where that answer was the one that was received and where the Court held that -- again and again that they were entitled to remission. 
    And where Mr. Wimbish, the Director of the Mississippi Department of the ATU, testified on the stand that that was -- and four years before this paper was accepted that that was the answer by which they meant they had no record or reputation. 
    It therefore says it admitted that they intended it that they interpreted it in that way. 
    That the Department of Justice had never challenged it but the District Courts had held it sufficient for 20 years. 
    And as they go further and admit that the Treasury Department prior to 1936, when enforcing the old statute by which they -- they were given discretion only to grant remissions or where there had not been any willful fraud -- willful negligence on the purpose of fraud, that the Department of Treasury interpreted that answer as sufficient not to constitute willful negligence for intent -- or purpose of fraud.

    Now, then the fundamental question on that issue is before this Court.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1204.607" stopTime="1207.726">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Is there some virtue to the phrase "willful negligence?"
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="1207.726" stopTime="1208.452">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    Sir?
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1208.452" stopTime="1210.497">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Some -- you used the phrase "willful negligence."
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="1210.497" stopTime="1351.588">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    The word -- the phrase "willful negligence and purpose of fraud" goes back to the Act of 1866 and it's been continued throughout until the new Act of 1936. 
    The Treasury Department was granted discretion to allow remission where there had not been willful negligence or purpose of fraud. 
    It was advanced forward in the Act of -- and which is now -- which is 19 U.S.C.A. 1618 which was the Act of 1922 made applicable to the Internal Revenue Department which said that the Treasury Department could grant remission where there was no purpose of fraud or willful negligence. 
    Now, our position here is that the judge had no -- the judge below had no discretion that -- arbitrary discretion. 
    One judge couldn't say on that answer to -- it was nothing -- no other facts and circumstance that that answer is sufficient to allow remission and another one say that answer and nothing else, there's not. 
    But it is a matter of review for the Court and a question before this Court whether or not that answer alone, standing alone, was approved of evidence whatsoever of any willful, not negligence but willful negligence which has come down in the statute since 1866. 
    How could it be willful negligence when the courts for 20 years had told them that if the officers that they inquired of had no record or no -- they had no record or reputation with those officers then what -- some other office -- officer, you don't need to go to all like they. 
    If the officers inquired of they have no record or reputation with them or that office that's enough. 
    How could it be willful negligence when the department itself for 20 years had told publicly on the stand, we mean that as a complete denial, we intended as a complete denial and we interpreted it as being a complete denial. 
    How could it be willful negligence on the part of Murdock when the District Courts and the Justice Department had gone for 20 years and allowed remission after remission on that answer and that answer alone, no other inquiry? 
    And then you could say that that was willful negligence for them to stand and accept that answer. 
    How could it be willful negligence when that is the very --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1351.588" stopTime="1361.440">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    But willful -- willful negligence is now, as I read it, we had at no time and in knowledge or reason to believe that it was being or would be used in violation of the law.
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="1361.440" stopTime="1644.815">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's the second requirement of the statute. 
    There are three, of course, requirements of the statute. 
    The first two are admitted here except -- except unless they contend that this answer gives them something to stand on. 
    The first one is good faith. 
    It must be approved of good faith lienor which is admitted. 
    The second that he had no reason to believe that the vehicle would be used for the violation of the -- of laws of any state of the United States. 
    The only thing they knew, which is admitted here, was this answer which was received from the ATU Then the third requirement is the making of the inquiry which they -- what we must make of only one -- we make of only one of the three officers in the ATU as the profit officer and get a negative reply. 
    Now, the statute -- this Honorable Court has held that it should be interpreted according to the test laid down by the Department of the Treasury -- the Secretary of the Treasury before the statute was enacted. 
    The statute was enactedclearly insofar as I see to take from the Treasury Department the pure discretion which was not reviewable by the Court and to give it to -- exclusive jurisdiction to the Court. 
    But under that statute, which this Court in United States versus One 1939 Ford, stated should be the basis of determination of its construction of that statute. 
    Well, it should be that those tests in what -- and the acts of the Treasury Department before the statute was enacted. 
    It is admitted here and stated that the Treasury Department, before it became a judicial matter, granted remissions consistently without questioning it whether this answer was received and interpreted it as being a sufficient answer. 
    The question is, what did -- does the statute mean by inquiring, which we did, and getting an answer that he had no record or reputation. 
    Does the statute demand that you get an answer from that one place, the only place you have to go and make the inquiry that we know he has no record or reputation anywhere or does the statute merely say you need only to go to one officer? 
    Congress knowing quite well that one officer would not know whether he had a record or reputation anywhere in the world and would not know what his reputation might be in some other place, but you only have -- the Congress said, you only have to go to one office and get a negative reply. 
    And what Congress meant was that a negative reply as far as that office was concerned. 
    The Government has taken a position that we should have made the same inquiry as you do of critic of -- of the credit and that we wouldn't stop for the credit investigation unless they guaranteed. 
    If Your Honor please, if -- if a credit -- any credit agency ever said, "We guarantee that this person has -- is good -- a good credit risk." 
    Then it would have been a most unusual credit agency. 
    In fact, the Associated Credit Bureau of America use a form in making their credit reports and they -- it contains this language, "This report is given simply as an aid in determining the propriety of extending credit of the value or condition of the -- of an existing credit and it's based upon information obtained from sources deemed reliable, the accuracy of which hour is in no matter guaranteed." 
    And that in effect was all that the ATU was saying and all that any truthful officer could say. 
    In our opinion he -- he has no record or reputation with us as a liquor law violator. 
    Insofar as we know he has none. 
    But we do not guarantee that we cover the well and that we can cover everything that might have happened in any court or in any office of the United States. 
    We are submitting to Your Honors that this administrative interpretation concurred in by other courts over a period of 20 to 30 years is -- if reasonable whatsoever is binding. 
    And it's binding on this Court under the authority of Bowles versus Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Company. 
    That also the same result is reached by a liberal construction of this highly penal statute. 
    This forfeiture of property or property rights by a liberal construction of that statute would be that the -- the statute does not require that a claimant, before he can buy a paper, must go find some officer who will say, "I guarantee and I know of it. 
    I have -- I have a record of every arrest and prosecution in the United States and I guarantee that he has no record or reputation." 
    That the statute couldn't less -- should not be in construe as required --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1644.815" stopTime="1650.700">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The statute -- going out to construe the statute liberally to arrive at that result here, the statute by putting it in the alternative obligation.
speaker="elizabeth_hulen_grayson" startTime="1650.700" stopTime="1706.121">
    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    I -- I agree with, Your Honor, and thoroughly. 
    By putting it in the alternative that the Congress knew that it would have been impossible for any officer to have known and if it had wanted a further or require any further inquiry of -- except the one officer would have made so. 
    Now, we submit that the Federal Government should not, in all justice and fair play, stand before this Court and say, "We're here as a good faithful lienor." 
    He made the inquiry at the right place, the only place he needed to. 
    He got the only answer he could get. 
    He got an answer that the Government, through his Justice Department with the ATU, that the courts has for 20 or 30 years interpreted as being a sufficient answer that it is admitted that the Murdock knew those facts and found those facts and then stand before this Court and say that there has been willful negligence on the part of Murdock. 
    We submit that that would not be fair play or judgement. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John F. Davis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1706.121" stopTime="1712.990">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Davis.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1712.990" stopTime="1774.262">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    If the Court please. 
    As Mrs. Grayson has said the facts in this case are supremely simple. 
    Leon Oatis was driving his 1951 Chevrolet along in Louisiana in April of 1953. 
    Investigators of the Internal Revenue Service stopped him and found 20 gallons of unpaid whiskey -- untaxed, unpaid whiskey in the automobile. 
    We don't know what happened to Mr. Oatis and we don't know what happened to the whiskey, but we are interested in the 1951 Chevrolet. 
    When Oatis had purchased this car in the preceding November at a price of $2200 which seems a rather extraordinarily large sum to pay for a car which was at least one year old and maybe two, he borrowed on it --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1774.262" stopTime="1775.654">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What kind of car was it?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1775.654" stopTime="1778.103">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    It was a two-door Chevrolet.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1778.103" stopTime="1779.353">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    When -- when did he buy it?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1779.353" stopTime="1914.738">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    He bought it in 1952, November of 1952. 
    It was a 1951 car. 
    So that it was at least one year old and since the model is changed in November it could have been two years old. 
    It was a used car at the time he purchased it. 
    He borrowed on this car $1590, the conditional sales contract. 
    In that contract, it was transferred to Murdock Acceptance Corporation, the petitioner here. 
    After the car was seized with the whiskey in it, the United States Attorney filed a libel of information in the District Court asking for forfeiture of the car to the United States. 
    This is provided by the statute. 
    And Murdock Acceptance Corporation filed an answer asserting its interest on the basis of the conditional sales contract and asking for mitigation or remission of the forfeiture. 
    Now, this procedure of course arises under a statute, 18 U.S.C. 3617, which is quoted on pages 2 and 3 of our brief. 
    It provides three conditions which a finance company must fulfill in order to be successful in its petition for mitigation. 
    It must have shown in the first place that it inquired its interest in good faith. 
    It must show that it had no reason to believe the car was going to be use for illegal purposes. 
    And it must show that proper inquiry has been made at the headquarters of the sheriff, the chief of police, of the federal revenue agent at -- at three places, one, the place where the purchaser live, two, the place where the purchaser bought the car, and three, any other place where the finance corporation makes investigation as to credit. 
    And it must receive a reply from -- in response to these inquiries that the purchaser has no record or reputation as a liquor violator either of state or federal law. 
    Now, the Murdock Acceptance Corporation before it acquired --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    In -- in these three places, yes. 
    In this case, there'd be only two because there was no credit investigation made except in the place where it was purchased so that that coincides with the place of purchase. 
    But under the law, they have to make inquiry at the place of residence, the place of purchase and if there is any additional inquiry as to credit, they must make this inquiry coextensive with their credit investigation.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    They technically -- I think we can say they did make it at the place of -- of residence. 
    There was only one inquiry made but the office at which they inquired covered both the place of residence and the place of business so that there is no issue before this Court as to whether they made the inquiry at the proper places.

    No. 
    That is right. 
    I would -- I would call to the attention of the Court and it isn't mentioned in our brief but it appears in the record and I think it's a fact that should be called to the attention of the Court because it may give the -- maybe the reason that no reply was received that the inquiry was made in the wrong name apparently.It was made in the name of Leon Oatis, O-T-I-S instead of O-A-T-I-S. 
    And it's possible that the revenue office had it out -- undoubtedly they had them out alphabetically and they may not have checked under O-A-T-I-S, they may have only checked under O-T-I-S.

    Now, in order to encourage a -- the -- the best possible type of -- of practical investigation they said you must go to officials and they named the state officials and they named the federal officials. 
    Now, actually as a matter of fact, the best records the most complete records of violation are kept by the federal officials and if this statute is to be as effective as possible in preventing the financing of -- like its cars, it's very advisable that the finance companies make the inquiry at the place where they will get the most information which is of the Alcohol Tax Unit which keeps an alphabetical list of the entire business. 
    So, the Alcohol Tax Unit was -- would be disturbed by the fact that they would no longer come to them because it wouldn't give them protection. 
    They would go to a sheriff, they'd go to a police chief, they'd go to somebody else. 
    And that is the reason for changing the form, it's -- it's now a form which is neutral as to what it covers, it just says we have no record of any reputation as a liquor law violator.

    It changed it with respect to the Internal Revenue law. 
    There has been changes made before with respect to the customs law and there had been changes with respect to the prohibition law itself and there had been other -- other cutting away of this absolute forfeiture but this was transferring really. 
    It wasn't a new thing. 
    It was really transferring from administrative rule to the Court rule the right to remand.

    It's something which happened after the -- the decision was made. 
    In -- in their attempt to -- to keep the finance companies from underwriting the bootleg business, they decided that they would give the best information they could to these people which would give them the protection and that's the form they deal it -- do it in. 
    It's not -- it's not an attempt to conceal anything. 
    It doesn't -- it doesn't state any -- any facts which are not so. 
    It merely doesn't add -- add a warning which the commissioner had previously thought was a proper warning for which the courts have said prevented his warnings, his statement from being adequate to -- to protect the insurance company -- the finance company. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John F. Davis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3593.653" stopTime="3610.871">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In the nature of things, it's implicit in the -- in the form, your second one, isn't it that they don't keep all the state records and therefore don't know everything that all the -- all the state officers know? 
    Isn't that implicit in it when they say so far as we're concerned, there is no reputation or record?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="3610.871" stopTime="3664.672">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    But they do keep more -- they do keep some state records. 
    They attempt to keep as full a record as they can of all of the violations. 
    So that it's -- let's -- they're -- they're trying to give as much information as they can on this thing. 
    And the only reason for dropping this is that they have no intention, they --- they would just drive people away from getting the best information they could gather. 
    I may say it too that when we say that there's discretion in this -- in the District Court to deny remission, we're not claiming any unreviewable discretion, we're not claiming absolute right as there was in the administration -- in the Secretary of Treasury and make a decision which isn't reviewable. 
    We merely say that when there is this type of single inquiry made of one office and nothing more then they may if they wish deny remission.

    Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson 
    If the Court please. 
    There is just question that I felt maybe had not been completely answered. 
    That was the statement of first the warning. 
    There was no warning, if Your Honor please, to this answer. 
    If it had been given as to one purchaser, yes, it might have been. 
    But when each and every purchaser was given -- you were given the same answer then it's not possible for each and every person to have a record of reputation much less probable. 
    So, there was no warning as to this particular individual. 
    It's -- it was warning as to everybody regardless where any inquiry is made. 
    The question was raised as to whether now the courts are turned to interpret the statute now rather than the Treasury Department. 
    If Your Honors please, yes, the courts are now -- maybe perhaps for the first time having this presented, although the District Courts all over the country have had it presented and it decided that they were entitled to remission. 
    But the rule in interpretation of the kind of answer that is required by the statute that should be effective here is of where, over a period of 30 years, those officers, given the duty of enforcing the statute, have interpreted that statute in one way for 20 to 30 years, concurred in by the judiciary, concurred in by the Department of Justice that then that method of interpretation of the statute is controlling on this Court if it is at all reasonable, if it is subject whatsoever to that construction. 
    So, we are asking this Court to construe it liberally as a highly forfeited penalize -- penal statute and to construe it in accordance with this long established departmental or administrative construction which is they admit it's reasonable. 
    That so far as they go in their briefs as to say it's possible for it have another construction. 
    And as this Court said in U.S. versus One 1939 Ford, the forfeiture acts are exceedingly drastic. 
    They were intended for the protection of the revenues not to punish without fault. 
    It would require unclouded language to compel the conclusion that Congress abandoned the equitable policy observed for a very long time of relieving those who act in good faith and without negligence.
