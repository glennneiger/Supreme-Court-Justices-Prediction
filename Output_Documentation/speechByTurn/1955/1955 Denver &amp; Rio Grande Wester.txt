speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="19.587" stopTime="142.785">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    May it please the Court. 
    At the adjournment yesterday, I had presented the facts relating to the issue of whether through routes were already in existence between the so-called excluded or northwest territory and via Ogden in the Rio Grande to points in the eastern and southern parts of the United States. 
    To summarize those facts very briefly, Union Pacific does not offer through transportation with Rio Grande on the traffic here involved, admittedly, by publishing with Rio Grande only prohibitively higher combination rates. 
    Union Pacific seeks to preserve its own long-haul on this traffic. 
    Substantial war time and emergency routings of traffic have been made via Rio Grande, Ogden and Union Pacific. 
    In addition, a trickle of commercial shipments, totaling 55 and they're represented at the year 1948, have passed over Rio Grande via Ogden and the Union Pacific. 
    The opposing views on this issue within the Commission, I submit, pinpoint this difficult question. 
    Is it enough that a through route exist in a technical sense and that a shipper who is willing to pay the higher combination rate may specify the alleged through route and that connecting carriers will comply with such a shipper's routing instruction and issue a through bill of lading? 
    Or must there be a proof that a through route exist in a realistic commercial sense in that the connecting carriers affirmatively hold themselves out as providing through transportation over the particular route or in the sense that shippers make a substantial use of the alleged through route?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Ginnane, is there any evidence in the record of refusal to operate as though through existence that you will prove (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="156.398" stopTime="164.388">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That there is no evidence on Union Pacific, on any of the other carriers refusing to honor a routing.

    How --

    Do you -- do you challenge any of the facts since it were relied on by the Colorado court?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="178.734" stopTime="188.899">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    No, sir. 
    Those facts, I think, I've -- I've just summarized in capsule form and those facts so far as I know are substantially undisputed by any of the parties.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="188.899" stopTime="198.140">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    There was evidence by the traffic witnesses of the Union Pacific that -- that they had moved that way?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="198.140" stopTime="209.483">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Evidenced by representatives of Union Pacific and Rio Grande and -- and that -- by that -- by that testimony while it did not necessarily meet was not contradictory.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="209.483" stopTime="233.917">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    No, but what I'm thinking about looking aren't on these. 
    That the principal traffic witness of the Union Pacific testified of shipper who was willing to pay the higher combination rate, had the right to specify under 15 (8) (Inaudible) via the Rio Grande. 
    And then it said this is going to -- the Court said that this would only be where there was a through rate -- through route.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="233.917" stopTime="242.767">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That's correct.If what the Rio Grande-- if what the Union Pacific witness was referring to was section 15 (8), that would be so. 
    15 (8) of the Act --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="242.767" stopTime="244.463">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    (Voice Overlap) referring to as I understand.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="244.463" stopTime="245.619">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    He didn't specify.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="245.619" stopTime="246.375">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    No --

    The -- the --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="246.405" stopTime="247.513">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    -- he simply said that any ship that comes --

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    The shipper has arrived.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That the shipper have the choice of routing.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="257.649" stopTime="258.466">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Yes.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="258.466" stopTime="291.386">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Now, from that Rio Grande contends and the District Court held that this amounted to an admission by Union Pacific that the through routes here in issue were in existence because, contends Rio Grande, section 15 (8) gives the shipper the choice of routing only where there are two -- two or more through routes in existence. 
    Where there are two or more through routes in existence, the shipper can specify which are the through routes he wishes to use.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="291.386" stopTime="298.350">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, then if you -- if you accept that, there would be (Inaudible) that there was a through route.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="298.350" stopTime="314.654">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    It would be evidence. 
    Now -- but there -- there still is the question, the basic question which divided the Commission, further evidence that occasional shipments are routing -- with the -- with the shippers routing being honored by the carriers over the alleged through route.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="314.654" stopTime="328.781">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    (Voice Overlap) -- have wanted to have routed but if there is a right through route. 
    There's a difference between the case of the shippers who may be routed and one where there is a right to demand that they be routed.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="328.781" stopTime="359.147">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That's -- that's correct. 
    Now -- so, the issue is, it divided the Commission 5-to-5 where there -- where a through route exists in a technical legal sense -- whether -- whether that is proof of the existence of a through route for the purposes of the Act in view of the -- of the safeguards which Congress in section 15 (4) has thrown around the carrier's long-haul.

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="373.271" stopTime="387.342">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Well, if a through route does not exist in even a technical legal sense then the carrier is not -- is not the -- the receiving or originating carrier is not obligated to issue a through bill of lading. 
    Of course, it couldn't.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="387.342" stopTime="404.253">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm not talking about through bill -- bills of lading. 
    I just -- I'm just talking about a shipper wanting to have his goods travel a certain route. 
    He can do that, can he not, if he's willing to pay the accumulated tolls on each of the lines?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="404.253" stopTime="421.982">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    No. 
    If there -- if -- if between carriers A and B, it's -- if it's clear that -- that there's no through route, then -- then the originating carrier need issue a bill of lading only covering the transportation service which it offers.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="421.982" stopTime="424.425">

    Yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="437.856" stopTime="449.512">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Are you saying (Voice Overlap) --if they only have a through route, he must still may, must he not, the originating carrier issue a through bill of lading?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="449.512" stopTime="459.777">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Yes, sir. 
    And if there are alternative through routes then section 15 (8), it gives the shipper the right to specify which of the alternative through routes to be employed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="459.777" stopTime="490.693">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Ginnane, may I revert to Justice Reed's earlier question? 
    In the course of your reply you said that the Commission was divided 5-to-5. 
    Now, let me clear up in my mind. 
    The Commission was divided 5-to-5 in the matter that's before it then before its divided 5-to-5, the claims of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande that there was an existing route did not prevail, is that right?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="490.693" stopTime="491.599">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That's correct, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="491.599" stopTime="512.686">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Thereupon, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande -- what preceded before the Colorado District Court to enjoin that order claiming error and that it did not find a through route. 
    But in that proceeding, the Commission evidently upholds the Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 
    Is it not?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="512.686" stopTime="513.644">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="513.644" stopTime="526.058">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, therefore, the Commission before the Denver court took the position, not 5-to-5 but as a body, as a litigant, that there wasn't a through route. 
    And the case then came here?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="526.058" stopTime="526.767">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That is correct, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="526.767" stopTime="557.592">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And in the joint brief of the United States, the Commission and the Secretary of Agriculture, you want all three, the Government and litigant, wants that decree of the Denver court reversed. 
    So, I don't understand what this 5-to-5 clause is except that it shed illumination on what the Commission had thought but so far as the position of the Government and the ICC and the Department of Agriculture is concerned, you are here urging this Court there was error on the part of Denver court. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="557.592" stopTime="558.770">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Sir, I agree entirely.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="558.770" stopTime="558.808">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="558.808" stopTime="566.351">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    And I -- and I refer to the 5-to-5 division merely as -- as evidencing that -- that it was considered a difficult question.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="566.351" stopTime="604.089">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But suppose the Commission had taken the other position. 
    Now, what effect would the failure to find in favor of D &amp; R.G. have? 
    In other words, what is the duty of the Court, when the Commission divided five and five, on the point where the burden is on the railroad to make its claim, divided 5-to-5? 
    What's the duty of the Court in connection with deciding those facts anew or as to deciding those facts for the first time? 
    What is your idea of the function of the Court there as of -- in reviewing that?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="604.089" stopTime="627.688">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    That in the circumstances of this case since the burden of proof or persuasion was upon Rio Grande, the Commission's report, full report concurred in by five members of the Commission in finding -- in -- in which it was found that through routes did not exist, that that should be treated as the order of the -- of the Commission which was open to challenge in the courts.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="627.688" stopTime="663.549">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The reason I raise the question is because in your answer to Justice Harlan yesterday when he asked you what the question was or what you represented the position of the Commission, you said was commendable candor or appropriate candor -- candor appropriate on the part of (Inaudible) They probably get credit for. 
    But that's so difficult to perhaps, a doubtful question on which you cared for, take a dogmatic position. 
    I take it that the Commission is here taking a dogmatic position. 
    By dogmatic meaning if it's such a position.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="663.549" stopTime="665.124">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    And I am about to take it, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="665.124" stopTime="665.421">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="665.421" stopTime="669.623">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I -- I have -- I have no -- no intention of trying to stay on fence, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="669.623" stopTime="683.823">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I didn't suggest that. 
    All I'm saying is that if you moved away, the Commission has moved away from 5-to-5 as an affirmative Commission here as part of its position, if I may quote eminent authority, a positive position --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="683.823" stopTime="684.681">

    Absolutely, sir.

    Doesn't that supplement the findings or lack of findings?

    I'm -- I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, the -- the duty is on the Commission to make findings, if it can, of facts. 
    One party alleges certain facts. 
    The Commission finds it's against that party by dividing 5-to-5. 
    Can the Commission supplement the position taken in the trial of that to please the Court by a new position it takes into court or --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="727.923" stopTime="728.300">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I understand.

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="732.033" stopTime="759.299">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Now, I understand, sir. 
    My answer -- perhaps, I can answer the question this way. 
    All 10 members of the Commission participating in the proceeding treated the long report concurred in by five Commissioners as representing the agency decision. 
    The others in their separate reviews refer to themselves as partly concurring or partly dissenting and referred to the long report as the majority report.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="759.299" stopTime="782.676">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In other words, your view, if I get it, I'm -- I'm a little far from it, I don't recall the case exactly but your view seems to be that since they were advised to file, the Commission has acted on to something. 
    So, that gives -- that was -- that did amount to a fact finding by them against the D &amp; R.G., is that it?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="782.676" stopTime="790.119">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I -- I have to take that position, Your Honor, otherwise there -- there'd be a gap in the administration of the law.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="790.119" stopTime="809.684">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that they are -- the fact that they are now taking that position in the Court is not a mere -- not a supplementing of finding of fact but taking the position that the facts were found by a failure to find by a majority of the other way?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="809.684" stopTime="821.303">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Perhaps they had, sir. 
    I think -- I think we have to take the position we're taking.Otherwise Rio -- otherwise I think Rio Grande to be in the position of being denied a forum of what's claimed.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I take it -- I take it that when the Commission appeared in court, whether the division in court or this Court, is the Commission's action not merely counsel but the Commission that is authorizing one position rather than another, is that right?

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="976.688" stopTime="999.291">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Their basic position, I think I'm stating their position fairly, is that they have, as a practical realistic commercial matter, closed the route by refusing to join with Rio Grande in -- in joint rates and -- and in -- in joining Rio Grande only in combination rates which is an -- for practical purposes are prohibitively high.

    Justice John M. Harlan

    That -- that there's more than that here and that the record bristles with statements or concessions that -- that Union Pacific's course -- course of business has been to protect its long-haul on this traffic. 
    That it in no way solicits in any affirmative sense at all traffic to be handled on a through route and joint rates with Rio Grande. 
    Well, that has been their -- one of their basic commercial positions through many years since 1912. 
    And that in fact very few shipments have moved at this higher combination rates leaving aside the -- the war time and emergency shipments.

    Well, the truth -- it is true to admit that through billing is also important to shippers, wholly apart from a joint rate. 
    The -- the service through billing afford advantages to a shipper, wholly apart from the -- the case quoted by the Chief Justice earlier. 
    It may be willing to pay more, to possess the advantages especially in private advantages but it is a nuisance to have to get separate billings at each particular permit.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    We think the question as to what should be the proper test for the existence of a through route must be resolved largely in terms of what test is necessary to carry out the congressional purpose in Section 15 (4). 
    By repeated amendments to Section 15 (4), as this Court has noted, Congress has laid down a clear purpose to protect railroad carriers in their long-hauls and has done this by carefully restricting the Commission's power to prescribe new through routes. 
    In the Thompson case, the Court told the Interstate Commerce Commission that the policy of Section 15 (4) was not to be evaded by using a too easy test as to the existence of -- of through routes. 
    Specifically in that case, the Court held that the fact that through transportation between two carriers is physically possible in the sense that there's a physical interconnection between the two lines. 
    But that is not enough to establish the existence of a through route. 
    The Court said that rather the test is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service and the Court could have otherwise of whether the -- whether the carriers course of business reflects the existence of a through route. 
    And I submit that in view of that policy of Section 15 (4) against carriers being forced to short-haul themselves, that the holding out or the course of business required to prove the existence of a through route should consist of representative conduct of carrier, that the facts should affirmatively show that the carrier either affirmatively offers through transportation or that, without objection by the carriers which -- which is being short-hauled, the public is making a substantial use of the alleged through route.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So that if a shipper, looking at the Union Pacific's tariffs, at any time after 1897, whatever that date was, he would find a route advertised or stated in the tariffs at a combination rate which included the Rio Grande to points east, is that right?

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I believe that is correct, sir. 
    So, applying those principles, the correct principles which we -- we deduced from the Thompson decision, it seems to us that the evidence of substantial war time and emergency shipments by Union Pacific, Ogden and Rio Grande should be disregarded. 
    Those shipments were neither voluntary on the part of -- of Union Pacific nor representative of its course of business. 
    There were diversions of traffic made under the compulsion of the Interstate Commerce Commission's emergency routing powers.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    My answer to that would be that the holding out is not a realistic holding out. 
    It's a holding out of through transportation service only at prohibitively high rates.

    As evidenced by the fact that --

    That's for the shipper to decide.

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1529.892" stopTime="1552.618">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    And shippers by and large have decided that they don't want to pay those rates and that out of 121,000 carloads of the traffic which is what's here involved between the northwest territory and points in the east and south. 
    In 1948, only 55, both eastbound and westbound, moved over to higher combination rates over Rio Grande.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1552.618" stopTime="1559.503">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That isn't because of a lack of holding out by the Union Pacific, that's because the shippers prefer to take a cheaper way.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1559.503" stopTime="1715.899">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Well, there's some evidence in the record that at -- there's evidence in the record that at least some of these -- some of those shipments were made through inadvertence by shippers who didn't -- who did not realize that joint rates were not applicable. 
    And we think that these few commercial shipments, total of 55 in the represented year of 1948, again are too few to constitute either -- to reflect either an effective realistic holding out by Rio Grande or to constitute any substantial use by shippers with the Union Pacific's acquiescence. 
    After finding that through routes via Rio Grande were not already in existence, the Commission considered whether it should prescribe new through routes and joint rates applicable to those routes. 
    Under the standards and limitations of -- of paragraphs (3) and (4) of Section 15, Section 15 (3) empowers the Commission whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest to establish new through routes and joint rates applicable to such routes. 
    However, since it would -- it's conceded that the routes proposed here would require Union Pacific to short-haul itself, the Commission also had to take into consideration and stated that it was taking into consideration the restriction of Section 15 (4) which provides that in establishing any such through route, the Commission shall not, except as provided in Section 3, require any railroad to short-haul itself with provisos and the pertinent exception here is unless the Commission finds that the through route proposed to be established is needed in order to provide adequate and more efficient or more economic transportation service. 
    I would like to refer briefly to the reiterated contention of Union Pacific in briefs and in oral argument that the Commission treated this case as a financial needs case in violation of the command of Section 15 (4) that through routes which would short-haul the carrier shall not be established by the Commission to assist another carrier in meeting its financial needs. 
    Now, that contention of Union Pacific is simply not true.

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1922.548" stopTime="2399.226">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    The -- the financial affairs of both carriers are matters of -- of public knowledge. 
    The Commission's ultimate finding was that it is necessary and desirable in the public interest in order to provide adequate and more economic transportation that through routes and joint rates over such routes, the same as apply over Union Pacific in its connecting lines, be established via Ogden in connection with the Rio Grande. 
    That the Commission sharply limited its order, was best establishing new through routes to the following commodity, to carload shipments of granite and marble monuments from Vermont and Georgia to points in the northwest territory and then more important to carload shipments of ordinary livestock, fresh fruits and vegetables, dried beans, frozen poultry, frozen foods, butter and eggs, from origins in the excluded territory to destinations east and south of the following area. 
    It was excluded from this grant of through routes, this area that was excluded for the reason that for destinations in that area, the Commission found that the use of Rio Grande's routes was too circulus for the establishment of -- of through routes to those points to be in the public interest. 
    The Commission's ultimate findings were based upon the following facts as to the needs of shippers, not as to the needs of Rio Grande but as to the needs of shippers. 
    And in view of the statements made to this Court yesterday that there was no record that there were neither findings nor evidence to support the Commission's order in this respect. 
    This evidence is set forth in considerable detail, first in the Commission's report in the record at volume two, pages 1547 and page 1564 and on the Government's brief in -- between pages 20 and 36. 
    Summarizing that evidence briefly, the excluded northwest territory produces substantial quantities of livestock, vegetables, fresh fruits generally. 
    There, it developed an elaborate system from marketing these commodities which involves extensive use of intransit privileges such as feeding, packing, freezing and so on. 
    These intransit privileges are available in practically all railroads including both Rio Grande and Union Pacific but as a practical matter, shippers can afford to use this intransit privileges on a particular carrier's line only if after reprocessing or freezing, as the case may be, the commodities can be reshipped on the balance of joint rates. 
    Similar of these commodities can be reconsigned while on route as buyers and markets are found, only through reconsignment -- only through rerouting can be done at joint rates. 
    Now, to illustrate, sheep and cattle produced in the northwest area, the area serve by Union Pacific, are desirable for feeding and breeding purposes. 
    On the other hand, there are good grazing areas in Utah and Colorado in the areas served by the Rio Grande. 
    Livestock is fattened in those feeding and grazing areas and reshipped to other parts of the country. 
    If livestock is moved from the excluded area for feeding in area served only by Rio Grande in Utah and Colorado, that livestock, after feeding, can be reshipped to points beyond the Rio Grande's lines only if the combination rates which are substantially higher than would be the balance of joint rates. 
    The result is to deprive livestock growers in the excluded territory of the market for their livestock represented by the feeding lots in Utah and Colorado served only by the Rio Grande and it deprives the feeders served only by the Rio Grande of access to the feeding stock produced in the northwest area. 
    A similar situation exists with respect to fresh fruits and vegetables which are grown in substantial volume either in Idaho, Washington and Oregon. 
    There exist on the Rio Grande, a point served only by the Rio Grande, numerous processors, dealers in such commodities but if they buy fruits and vegetables, potatoes, produced in the excluded territory for processing, packing and so on, on the Rio Grande that can -- they cannot ship such commodities after processing in transit to points beyond the Rio Grande except at the higher combination rates. 
    And in the case of the fruits and vegetables, potatoes, there's still a further factor. 
    Those commodities are frequently shipped, put on cars and started moving generally toward the east at a time when -- when a -- before a buyer has been obtained. 
    So that the right to reconsign as buyers are found or as a buyer has lost and another buyer is found is very important. 
    Those reconsignment privileges exist on practically all railroads including Union Pacific and Rio Grande, but the reconsignment privileges are practically unavailable unless they can be exercised on through rates and on a balance of -- on joint rates or on a balance of joint rates. 
    For example, if an Idaho shipper routes a carload of potatoes under -- via Rio Grande and while on Rio Grande he finds a buyer at a point beyond -- beyond Rio Grande's lines, he can reroute only at the higher combination rates. 
    That means that he will probably, in most instances, have to sell the potatoes at a sacrificed price rather an attempt to reconsign them or reroute them at the combination rates, that's called a pocket market. 
    In the case of the same shipper, for example, these ships bound to Oklahoma on -- on a through route by Union Pacific and then wants to reroute into the southeastern part of United States as he finds a buyer, he can do so only at the higher combination rates. 
    That's because the Union Pacific and shipments coming out of the northwest territory will allow through routes to the north -- to destinations in the southeast or in the shipments that utilize Union Pacific long-haul to either Omaha or Kansas City. 
    The shipment ends up down here. 
    If the Idaho shipper wants to reconsign the points to the southeast, he can do so only at the higher combination rates, whereas to such a shipper, the entire southwest area is a pocket market.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I should make it clear that the Commission did not find, indeed Rio Grande does not contend that Union Pacific does not render good service on its routes. 
    The Commission made no finding that Union Pacific does not render adequate service on its routes. 
    The Commission's finding was that these shippers of these specified commodities in the northwest territory need through routes and joint rates via Rio Grande in order to -- to take advantage of the markets represented by the intransit facilities served only by Rio Grande points and in order -- to be able to exercise effectively reconsignment privileges over the Rio Grande.

    No -- no sir.

    Adequate for moving these commodities along Union Pacific's routes.

    Mr. Frank E. Holman 
    If the Court please. 
    Not to belabor the discussion that's just taken place that arose originally, I think, with the Chief Justice's question yesterday of counsel of the Union Pacific with respect to whether or not the Union Pacific's facilities are adequate. 
    And counsel directed Your Honors' attention then only to the statement under opposition testimony. 
    And that, I submit, is not a finding and was not so intended. 
    The real finding which hasn't yet been called to the attention of this Court is on page 1574 of consolidated record Roman numeral II. 
    And thereafter, the intervening discussion of opposition testimony and pro-testimony, here is the finding while the through service over defendant's routes, that's the Union Pacific's routes, in general is a satisfaction to the shipping public as the service which could be provided over routes including the Rio Grande, this is not true with respect to the commodities we have enumerated. 
    Now, there's claim. 
    Well, there isn't time here to show what the evidence was on that but there is the claim. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3116.097" stopTime="3120.257">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's under “General Discussion and Ultimate Fact Findings?”
speaker="frank_e_holman" startTime="3120.257" stopTime="3269.194">
    Mr. Frank E. Holman 
    That's right. 
    Yes. 
    Now, I do not want to spend too much time on 15 (4), 15 (4) is the statute which I frankly confessed in the beginning which creates a monopoly in behalf of a railroad in connection with the privilege of preserving its long-haul. 
    But 15 (4) has nothing to do, the matter of establishing new through routes under the restrictions therein contained. 
    I submit has nothing to do with the issues in the Colorado case. 
    And so, I would like to go to that situation and in the brief time at my disposal attempt to clear up, if not, the point of view of others at least to present clearly the point of view of the Rio Grande because this question of through routes was concededly the first and paramount issue in this litigation. 
    The Rio Grande had an unquestioned right under the statutes to resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission and asked for a decision upon this allegation that through routes were in existence. 
    Not that they were to be established under 15 (4). 
    That wasn't the complaint. 
    The action went off on that later. 
    But the through routes were actually in existence. 
    Now, there were two prongs to that, not one but two. 
    First of all, that through routes had been established and competitive joint rates had been established admittedly when we were operating in relation with the Oregon Short Line and the (Inaudible) 
    And then when the Union Pacific took over control of those routes, it cancelled only the competitive joint rate and never made a notation on the tariff or never put anybody on notice or ever suggested that the through routes were cancelled or were intended to be cancelled.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are there examples of those tariffs, modern tariffs, in the record?
speaker="frank_e_holman" startTime="3273.054" stopTime="3801.475">
    Mr. Frank E. Holman 
    I think so, Your Honor. 
    Now, how are we met and I'm still on the first form, not on the question of user at all, not on the question of shipments which is there theretofore to this problem. 
    We are met in this case by the statement that because there was a higher rate, the routes were commercially (Inaudible) 
    Now, I submit that this Court has settled that question. 
    In the Great Northern case and in the Virginia case and another cases that the formula, and that's how simple it is and the Union Pacific's defense that the mere possession of a higher rate automatically close the through routes. 
    Of course the commercial deterrent kept the shipments down. 
    The wonder is we had 55 cars in the typical year. 
    We only use the typical year 48. 
    The wonder is that there were enough shippers willing to pay that higher rate. 
    It wouldn't have been much longer if we'd only had 10 cars.Now, on these government shipments, there's a point there to be cleared up. 
    Yes, these shipments were under service orders. 
    What a service order merely compels the carrier to take the shipment, it doesn't compel it to settle that competitive joint rates which the Union Pacific did on those shipments and they were perfectly willing it took no compulsion when 19,000 cars were shifted from Western Pacific, it's one of our allied lines in southern and they took them over. 
    They took them over on a through route basis. 
    In other words, required to take them but they weren't required to take them on a through route basis. 
    And if there was no through route then if you look at Section 15 (4), you'll find that the Commission has the power in any emergency if there is no through route to establish a temporary through route for that emergency. 
    And so, the Commission itself recognized when it merely enter -- issued a service order that the through routes were there unavailable and could be used. 
    Now, that's one form of it, I say, and we might stand on that alone and not be compelled to show any shipments at all. 
    What the other form is this question of user and of holding out and we're told that it's not realistic because the Union Pacific never went out or actively solicited traffic. 
    Does anyone suppose down here, where we have through routes, why user's consent that the Union Pacific ever goes above the prospective costumers in that area and urge -- assumed to ship over the Rio Grande? 
    You don't have to have active solicitation. 
    What is a holding out? 
    As we stated in our brief, the merchant on the street who has his door open for business is holding out. 
    He doesn't need to go out into the street and urge costumers to come in to his shop. 
    A holding out is merely being open for business on a certain basis and the Union Pacific and all its trade officers have been open for business on a through route basis and never have they refused to issue a through bill of lading. 
    Now, may I clear up another matter? 
    Mr. Justice Harlan has been interested in this question of 2011 and Mr. Collins said, as I understood him, that under 2011, a railroad is compelled to issue a through bill of lading. 
    On -- of you return to our brief. 
    At page 47, our opening brief, you'll find this section is discussed and I think carefully, 2011 requires -- and that's basically a section so that the shipper will have a receipt and he can sue for damages, for negligence and other matters. 
    And so, the section does provide that a common carrier must give a receipt or a bill of lading but it does not say through bill of lading. 
    And Justice -- Mr. Ginnane very frankly admitted a railroad may decline to which the through bill of lading. 
    Now, in 48 is the Section you were reaching for, if I may say so, Section 6 (1) which empowers railroads, in fact, requires railroad to publish these tariffs and it distinguishes, as you see on page 48 of our brief, it says that they must publish the tariffs and they may show when a through route and joint rates have been established. 
    If no joint rate or through route has been established if no joint rates or through if it has been of service to several carriers on such through route so (Inaudible) and keep open for the public inspection as aforesaid and so on. 
    So as Mr. Hickey indicated in his brief and he's much a much abler commerce lawyer than I pretend to be, Mr. Hickey in his little brief for the American Short Line Railroad Association has fully explained, I believe, this whole situation of how a railroad, by filing a tariff if it wants to also cancel the through routes may do so. 
    If it does then some shipper and interested party may come in. 
    Now, it has been said here that this is a question of fact, this question of the existence of through route. 
    Yes, it's a question of fact as to whether through routes were ever established there and compared to the joint rate, but I submit to you as this case reached the Colorado court, it was not a question of fact. 
    It was strictly a question of law because there was no disagreement at all on the basic fact, and I don't think it will -- quite true to say if I may say so that there must have been something in the nature of a motion here, Mr. Justice Reed, where a decision was reached. 
    We were entitled to a decision on that question, not if it was merely an administrative matter. 
    What if the facts were undisputed? 
    This Court has always considered it a question of law and it's so admitted in the Union Pacific's brief or we considered it a question of law as to whether through routes are in existence or not. 
    And that brings us to the Thompson case and I want to finish on that note. 
    In the Thompson case, there were no through routes of any kind and no shipments had ever gone forward. 
    There was no background that the through route ever having been established or a competitive to a greater existence. 
    And so, the difficulty here is that this Commission was concerned about the Thompson case and query and this is my last query, does is take five shipments under the Thompson case or 10 or 50 or 20 or 55? 
    And whatever result comes from this litigation, if I may say so, whether Rio Grande prevails or Union Pacific, I think it is important for this Court to clarify the Thompson case and make a claim so that no Commission again divide by its class on this important issue, I think.

    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    I'd like to suggest first of all that this -- all this talk about whether or not through routes and joint rates were in existence by the Rio Grande is wasted, if it ever amounted to this thing. 
    It became moot when the Commission knocked that off the ground in a way by saying that the routes are necessary in the public interest, but next to what extent? 
    To the extent that joint rates are necessary on particular a commodity. 
    They have as to whether or not through routes existed has been played up by the Rio Grande in an effort to get this case back to the Commission and get a fresh start and see if they can -- better -- better order than they've had. 
    The Commission said the rates -- the routes are needed, of course, they can brush a short-haul prohibition aside just for the use of the words then they could say as it is. 
    The next step, to what extent are the -- they wouldn't argue and come to discover on everything -- every commodity in tariff. 
    They said they'll need it on these commodities, the perishable commodities because we think that perishable commodities need every possible route thus going far beyond in the statutory (Inaudible) 
    Then as I said, the Court yesterday, they reached out and brought in dried beans and livestock under that tent and then that not being enough brought in the westbound tombstone. 
    Now, may I say to the Court that their effort to the efforts of counsel for the Rio Grande suggest that there's confusion in the Thompson case is futile so far as this case is concerned. 
    Thompson made it definitely clear that the publication by each -- each railroad that connects it with the next one of its local joint rate did not result in the establishment of through routes and we get upon the point Mr. Justice Frankfurter was touching awhile ago that if that would be so then the through routes power given to the Commission in 1906, 19 years after the original Act required the publication of local rates by each carrier, is all a futile gesture and unnecessary surplus. 
    And the idea that the Union Pacific, by not making some note in its tariff or tariffs, saying that the route is close as I have said to you yesterday and I point to discussion in page -- of the railroads brief in number 333, the Colorado case, page 76. 
    I've cited cases there which said -- say that we can't put any kind of a -- of a wording in a tariff, it will -- will prevent us from carrying out a statutory duty. 
    They might as well say that we'll publish another so we won't pay our income tax because the duty is just as binding on us to act as a common carrier, to accept shipments when they're offered at whatever rate is published. 
    We're compelled to publish rates and to accept shipments and all of these -- these pathetic talk about our having never put a roadblock or torn up the tracks or having published the futile note in the tariffs saying the route is closed is without the -- the slightest substance and nothing but an effort to get this case back to the Commission to take a fresh start for seven more years of this onerous litigation.

    Eastbound rates and here's the tariff, eastbound rates from points subject to the Western gateway's name herein do not apply on traffic delivered by the Union Pacific to connecting lines at junction points in the State of Utah. 
    That's the Rio Grande Railroad.

    The Union Specific in one -- number 333, where I show that in three to four of those old proceedings that took place at the time those rates were canceled, the Commission said the Union Pacific offers tariffs opposing to cancel through routes and joint rates. 
    And the discussion, all the way through, showed that the Commission thought it was canceling the through routes as well as the joint rates and nobody ever had any such thought as you now hear it thence until the right man dug it up (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    I -- I don't see it admittedly but one of them was -- was the Ogden Gateway case and maybe I'm looking the wrong brief and two or three others there which repeat that the Commission was canceling through routes to the extent that authorized the tariffs as well as joint rates. 
    Now, that's the language it used and that's what at all it was doing 50 years ago. 
    They come to you now and tell you they didn't do it. 
    We've got a new theory about it so the result is that the through route have been there all the time but if they held then they've been there on every railroad in this country, every connecting railroad. 
    They were not there for any other reason according to their argument except because joint rates were published and the lines physically connected. 
    If that's so then a joint rate is all as -- I mean the through route is forever there and nobody can do anything about it. 
    It's then is a through route under compulsion and the -- the whole statutory pattern becomes distorted.

   Rebuttal of Elmer B. Collins
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4428.799" stopTime="4510.876">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yesterday, I asked you about the question of adequacy and what the language of the Commission was in finding that the facilities of the Union Pacific were adequate. 
    And you referred me to that portion of the report of the Commission which is entitled, "Opposition Testimony" in which it said its present facilities are adequate to move over its own direct routes, the present volume of traffic in any additional volume that may be anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
    Now, today, Mr. Holman points out to us, under the heading “General Discussion and Ultimate Fact Findings,” the following language, "While the true service over defendant's routes in general is as satisfactory to the shipping public as the service which could be provided over routes including the Rio Grande via Ogden or Salt Lake City, this is not true with respect to the commodities we have enumerated." 
    Then jumping to the latter sentence of that same paragraph, it says, "On such traffic, the defendant's routes are inadequate unless economical and are the Rio Grande routes." 
    Now, would you explain the difference between those two and which is binding on us -- binding on us insofar as the question of adequacy is concerned.
speaker="elmer_b_collins" startTime="4510.876" stopTime="4519.794">
    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    Your Honor, I have never seen a more confusing and fuzzy and puzzling paragraph and inconsistent piece of writing in my life than that --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="elmer_b_collins" startTime="4520.283" stopTime="4687.788">
    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    -- paragraph. 
    Now, they say first that the Union Pacific routes can make it in at least 24 hours shorter time. 
    For traffic, this traffic moves, mind you, from the Northwest to Atlantic City in New York. 
    The question is getting it from the west origin to the east in termini. 
    And yet they say it is not true that we can do all that, haul perishable goods. 
    And why can't we? 
    They don't explain. 
    They don't tell us why we can't haul perishable goods that's passed or pass at the Rio Grande. 
    They tell us that perishable goods need a lot of transit services, after telling us in the first place that they must travel with expedition and care. 
    Then they tell us that they must stop for periods which under the tariff could be as long as 12 months. 
    (Inaudible) privilege is what puts the Commission itself in this case and this Court wants in the decision in 305 U.S.by Mr. Justice Reed, that is a commercial operation and not a transit -- not a transportation service. 
    So, then next they say, the shippers in the Northwest, who now have the Union Pacific routes and a few of whom, 20 -- 22 of whom as against 73, the Commission says are debarred. 
    The 73 denies that they're debarred and they denied that they want the long routes. 
    They say they are satisfied but the Commission says you were debarred no matter what you say from these markets in the country because you can't ship over the Rio Grande at the same rate you can over the Union Pacific Railroad. 
    They each testified that they reached every market in the country in the all 48 States -- I -- I beg your pardon. 
    They say we -- we ship our goods to every State in the 48 States and to six foreign countries. 
    Now, that came both from Rio Grande witnesses and witnesses that uphold the Rio Grande. 
    I -- I say to you, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Commission has -- has so obviously, to me in that paragraph, contradicted itself that I see no way to reconcile the -- the statements in it.And if the Union Pacific routes are inadequate because we don't serve points that might want to go through a commercial operation called transit located along the Rio Grande then we are sunk indeed and so is the rail -- the railroad in the country.
