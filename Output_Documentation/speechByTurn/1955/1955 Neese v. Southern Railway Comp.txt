    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may proceed, Mr. Alderman.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="3.489" stopTime="210.138">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I was referring to the decision itself by the Court of Appeals below. 
    On my brief, the gray brief, pages 8 to 15. 
    I admitted very careful, restatements of the case and of the holding of the court below with pertinent quotations beginning at page 11, and on page 12, from the Court's language in this case. 
    In the first quoted paragraph, it will be observed that the Court did not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the District Court as to what precise amount of damages were justifiable in this case. 
    The District Court said 60 was excessive, 50 was all right. 
    The Court of Appeals dealt with the evidence in the case, they admitted the evidence as to contribution the actual evidence, and it dealt with what in railroad rate problems as often referred to as the zone of reasonableness. 
    It fixed the zone of reasonableness for the damages from bottom -- it gets $18,000 to $19,000 and top brackets which it describe as fantastic on the evidence of $38,000 to $39,000. 
    Leaving it for a subsequent jury trial to fix something reasonable in that zone of reasonableness. 
    Far from denying to this plaintiff a jury trial, the Court dealt liability issues as well as damage issues. 
    Both courts held that the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury to find the liability. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed for a jury trial on the issue of damages alone, the most perfect situation in which a plaintiff in a damage suit can be whether defendant has no defense on negligence or liability. 
    As a frightful matter, if this Court affirms the court below, that's what will happen. 
    Plaintiff will have a new jury trial under those favorable circumstances on damages alone. 
    Maybe he has new evidence, I don't know. 
    The other alternative, if this Court should hold, and I think it would be a most serious holding, that is there is no appellate jurisdiction or power in the federal judiciary system. 
    To review a judge for abusive discretion, a trial judge on the matter of this kind, but then this Court would reverse the Court of Appeals below and it would affirm the judgment of the District Court.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Alright. 
    Why do you use the phrase abusive discretion?

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Sir?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="213.734" stopTime="216.438">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Why do you use the phrase abusive discretion?
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="216.438" stopTime="371.679">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    That's the phrase that the Court of Appeals below used, and I was leading up to inviting you to the language of that court in the middle of page 12 as quoted in my brief. 
    Its ultimate conclusion was a total contribution of $50,000 by young Neese to his parents. 
    And he and they lived out there with normal expectancy, seems to us far beyond the pale of any reasonable probability and entirely without support in the record. 
    Then he cited cases from the Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, from other Circuits and particularly the 1948 decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals this same Court in the Virginian Railway against Armentrout. 
    And the -- and the Court quoted from the Armentrout case this language, which is its statement of what it understands the law to be and the law as it applies perhaps. 
    Much more better than the argument act it made. 
    The Court of Appeals below said, ordinarily, of course, the amount of damages is for the jury, and whether a verdict should be set aside as excessive is a matter resting into the discretion of the trial judge. 
    This, however, is not an arbitrary but a sound discretion to be exercised in the light of the record in the case and within the limits prescribed by reasoning and experience. 
    And where a verdict is so excessive, that it cannot be justified by anything in the record. 
    All of which the Court can take judicial notice, it is the duty of the judge, that is the trial judge, to set is aside, failure to do so is an abusive discretion analogous to error of law and as such reviewable on appeal. 
    Now that's the very question which Mr. Justice Brandeis to this Court pre-committed and reserve for future decision in Paramount Glassworks case, and I remind the Court that that case was decided in 1933, I will come to hit its historical setting in a moment.

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    The highest contribution, that the plaintiffs -- that the beneficiaries, the plaintiff's beneficiaries contented had ever been made to them by the sum of $75 just before he died and at other terms from $30 to $45 a month.

speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="430.714" stopTime="485.900">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Yes, sir. 
    Undoubtedly, this was a good boy and a good son, and he was generally (Inaudible) disposed to his parents. 
    There are certain undisputed facts in the case however, summarized on page 9 of my brief. 
    He had worked for the respondent as a crime inspector for 3 years and 15 days. 
    During his time, his total take home pay was $6544.79. 
    An average of slightly under $2181 a year. 
    Of that total of $6544 he had actually save for himself not to use it upon himself and not contributed to anyone its total of $4984 on the building and loan account.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="485.900" stopTime="491.421">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But that was only after he had offered it all to his parents in the event that he had decided to take it.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="491.421" stopTime="515.687">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    True sir, but he was a man of age, single, no children, no dependents, it isn't contented with his parents were determined and he boarded and roomed with his parents. 
    There's no evidence that he paid them anything for board or room, and of course, if the father needed a paycheck, he would be glad to turn it over to him.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="515.687" stopTime="552.621">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But suppose -- suppose the boy had offered him, offered the parents all of his earnings as he did -- apparently did here, there was evidence to that effect. 
    And the parents said, “No, we don't -- we don't need anything at the moment. 
    We don't want to take anything from your earnings at the moment.” 
    And the boy turns out and saves it all. 
    He doesn't give them anything. 
    Would you say under those circumstances that they would have no right to recovery because they didn't take it, or would it have to be limited to the amount he contributed?
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="552.621" stopTime="569.033">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    I think its -- it isn't necessarily limited it to the amount he actually contributed. 
    It's a reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence as to what pecuniary laws these nondependent parents sustained.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="569.033" stopTime="569.083">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="569.083" stopTime="575.896">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    That is what reasonable contributions they might have anticipated from this young man.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="575.896" stopTime="615.505">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But what I'm trying to get at is this. 
    Did the Court limit itself to his own view that half a quarter of his earning was all that could reasonably be expected to come from him, or did it take in to consideration the fact that the had tendered all of his earnings to his parents, and the fact that even when they didn't take it, he was of a saving disposition that he worked hard around the little ranch that they had, and that he had this money available there to all the terms and purposes for whatever use his parents might want to make it.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="615.505" stopTime="624.396">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    I think the Court took that all into consideration because it commented on it in the earlier part of its opinion. 
    I haven't undertaken to quote that full opinion here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="624.396" stopTime="626.673">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well that's -- that's very important to me.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="626.673" stopTime="627.154">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="627.154" stopTime="632.542">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where in the opinion does it say they took that all into consideration?
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="632.542" stopTime="655.255">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    It's in the earlier discussion before the part of the opinion below, which I am -- the entire opinion starts at page 45 of the record --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="655.255" stopTime="655.981">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes I have it.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="655.981" stopTime="683.103">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    -- and ends at page 51. 
    At the first beginning paragraph on page 49, that evidence is discussed, the parents of Neese testified that he always give his full paycheck to daddy and told him to use it as he please and so on.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="683.103" stopTime="733.545">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    But the -- but do they say in there that they took that into consideration when they get over to the paragraph on -- on page 50. 
    They say, if we assume, however, that the parents reasonably could have expected an average contribution of $100 per month for the rest of their lives, what is the present value of such an expectation? 
    And then they say, “We shall assume this optimum conditions.” 
    Now, what is there in the evidence or in their opinion that shows their reasoning in making this $100 represent the most optimum conditions?
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="733.545" stopTime="746.087">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Well, I think it's based on the study of all of the evidence in the case and particularly the evidence as to actual contributions and as to the savings of the young man and so forth.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="746.087" stopTime="766.827">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well what is there in here to show that -- that it should be one-fourth of his earnings, let us say rather than a third of his earnings? 
    And -- and what is there of certainty in the facts that would compel anyone to arrive at this $100 a month instead of some larger sum?
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="766.827" stopTime="838.740">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Well, I don't think the Court of Appeals below set alone any $100 a month as I say. 
    They undertook to estimate its own reasonableness for -- remember this is a cash payment now which will draw an income in the future which the Court of Appeals below said would range from $18,000 or $19,000 at the bottom up to $38,000 -- $37,000 or $38,000 at the top. 
    It was putting a legal judgment on what reasonably could be produced as damages from all the evidence in the case as I understand it. 
    Now moreover, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether that was a correct decision by the Court of Appeals below is not here on this writ of certiorari. 
    It was not presented as a question presented on the petition. 
    In other words, the merits of that decision are not held. 
    The sole question was presented or whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdictional power to pass on that question at the review of the district judge's upon it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="838.740" stopTime="844.803">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well didn't the Court actually make a computation based on an expected income of $2500 for a month.

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Yes, sir.

    The District Court made no announcement whatsoever as to the grounds upon which he made his decision except to say that the verdict was excessive, but he didn't he feel that it was the result of ramification of prejudice and he would set it aside unless the plaintiff would follow -- in other words, he fixed out of the area $10,000. 
    And he made no statement to show the basis of the remittitur which he suggested a thing which on the face of it, it seems to me, indicates if you are the person law or arbitrary of judgment.

    We earn some money and we earn a fair and reasonable amount. 
    But what concerns me in this case, is, what I think would be done to the few administration justice in the federal courts appeal to what should hold that the Courts of Appeals of the United States are entirely without jurisdictional power to review a trial judge for abusive discretion and refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive or as inadequate.

    Well, Mr. Alderman, if this Court was to hold of this -- on the facts of this case, the decision was -- was such that a reasonable -- the facts were such that reasonable people might come to different conclusions on it and that therefore, there was no abusive discretion on the part of the District Court.

    But I stil insist that this Court did not bring this case here for that purpose. 
    It brought it here to decide an important question of federal appellate jurisdiction, and to resolve what is at least a verbal conflict between the different Circuits on that question.

speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="1590.068" stopTime="1888.068">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    That's what you have said constantly in your decision. 
    I started to say and my time is rightly elapsing, that I was somewhat shaded apparently with over frankness and the second point of my argument beginning at page 22 of my brief, until the partition that this Court not to be just as entirely frank as I know how to be. 
    Undoubtedly, the long list of cases that Mr. Justice Brandeis put in his footnotes in Fairmount, as of 1933, constituted an overwhelming weight of authority against my position in this case as of that date. 
    I have read and studied and analyzed all of those old cases. 
    I made a careful study on the earlier cases where the rule first began to be expressed and I am convinced, that the rule had this entire basic foundation on this procedural limitation of writ of error, which had gone -- couldn't bring up at all to an appellate court any question about a motion of the new trial -- for new trial of the overruling of the motion for a new trial. 
    I -- I have no time to review those cases but I think if you understood to look at the analysis of them on the brief, in four or five of the very earliest of those cases, this Court simply said that we cannot review this question on writ of error. 
    That was repeated time after time and then as the old cases so frequently did, they took a step farther, went through a transition. 
    Gradually, the statement began to be changed into a statement of the rule of lack of jurisdiction. 
    It has been repeated so often that the Court just got, I think, in the habit of saying we don't review this kind of question. 
    The first case in which it got around to that was in the late part of the last century, Kerr against Clampitt 95 U.S.188, cited on page 46 of my brief in 1877. 
    There we did and it's the first case I can find where this Court stated it as -- has a rule of no jurisdiction but then it went on in the passage I've quoted and carefully showed the origin of it in this common law of limitation on the writ of error that the Court could not look into a thing because it was not a part of the record. 
    Now I do, of course, admit that state of decision shown in the footnotes in the Fairmount Glass Works case in 1933. 
    I have a historical discussion in my brief which I won't have time to review here. 
    Tracing the changes in the judicial code from the original Act of 1789 down to the Act of 1948, which rewrote to recodified and enacted into positive law the judicial code as Title 28, United States Code, (Inaudible) 1952 edition. 
    In 1928, Congress took the two first batch at abolishing the common law, the writ of error, and its technicalities. 
    They didn't complete that job. 
    They didn't go back and repeal inconsistent laws, and put it in final shape until in the Recodifying Act of 1948. 
    The Fairmount case was decided in 1933, 14 and some years before the Recodifying Act, but five years after the first two batch that Congress took at abolishing the old common law writ of error. 
    And such was the acuteness of Mr. Justice Brandeis writing for this Court that he, knowing what Congress had done in 1928 was careful in that decision to show that the abolition of the writ of error had abolished that whole basis for the old rule against jurisdiction. 
    He, of course, could not know what was going to happen 14 years later in 1948. 
    But he saw that Congress in terms had abolished common law writ of error.

    Now I think, if the Court please, it's highly significant also and I don't want to be overtaking to look about the questions that petitioner presented but the rules of this Court also require that he should set out the statutes involved in this case. 
    He said that most statutes whatsoever, either on petition or on brief though he does quote the Seventh Amendment as being involved.

    But if he's right about that and he doesn't have to set out the statute.
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="2045.646" stopTime="2172.690">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    That's quite right. 
    I suppose -- but I do set out the statutes and I'd like to invite the Court's attention to them on page 2 of my brief. 
    First, all the three come from the Recodifying Act of 1948. 
    The first one, Section 23 of the Act of June 25, 1948, was the final step in abolishing common law writ of error. 
    All Acts of Congress referring to writs of error shall be construed as amended to the extent, I say, it's a substitute appeal for writ of error. 
    Now the two jurisdictional statutes follow. 
    Section 1291 is this. 
    It's now 1291 of the United States Code, Title 28, 1952 edition. 
    The Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the District Courts of the United States except for a direct appeal maybe heading in the Supreme Court. 
    Now that's a jurisdictional statute. 
    This was a final judgment. 
    It's certainly was not one from which a direct appeal could come to this Court. 
    Now most significantly, even this thing, Section 2106, which is the -- the controlling statute now, which was not in existence in 1933. 
    The Supreme Court or any other Court of appellate jurisdiction, may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside, or reverse any judgment, decree or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as maybe just under the circumstances.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2172.690" stopTime="2179.265">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What -- what weight do you give to the comments of the advisor (Inaudible)
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="2179.265" stopTime="2493.776">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    I set those out fully in my brief. 
    They showed that certain of the old provisions were appealed as obsolete. 
    The old provision of Section 22 of the original judiciary act forbidding reversal from error in fact was repealed in 1948. 
    But I do want to call your attention to this fact in connection with my historical discussion and I haven't had time to go into. 
    September 24 and 25, 1789 or perhaps two of the most significant days in our history. 
    The first Congress -- first session at that time was dealing with two documents of the greatest importance. 
    First was the Judiciary Act which established the federal judiciary and regulate. 
    The other was 12 proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States. 
    The Judiciary Act and the proposed amendments went through the legislative history of that Congress almost hand in hand. 
    They were considered in the light of each other. 
    There were two views in that Congress. 
    One was that the Judiciary Act should be affixed first and then the amendments passed upon in the light of the Judiciary Act. 
    Others thought vice versa, but they did go hand in hand and that was the most extraordinary effort that's harmonizing the Judiciary Act and the proposed amendment. 
    You recall that the first two of 12 proposed amendments whenever ratified by the States so they became the first 10 Amendments of the Bill of Rights and proposed amendment nine became Amendment Seven. 
    Now that very Congress in that very Judiciary Act while they put in Section 22 which is common on -- on Mr. Justice Brandeis in Fairmount, also carried Sections 17 -- Section 17 I've quoted on page 38 of my brief. 
    And I think it's a profound significance. 
    The Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of Appeals -- oh I'm sorry. 
    I picked up the wrong words. 
    Oh, page 34 of my brief. 
    Section 17 of the original Judiciary Act provided this. 
    That all of the said courts of the United States, District Court, Circuit Courts, and this Court, appellate courts and trial courts, that all of the said courts of United States shall have power to grant new trials in cases where there has been a trial by jury for reasons for which new trials have used it and granted in the courts of law. 
    Now at that point on page 34 of my brief is the defect in my research. 
    I said that that language remand the same except for a comma that was properly put in by the Act of 1911. 
    I was wrong about the comma was put in. 
    The phrase was properly punctuated by revised statutes Section 726 of 1878 and then the Act -- the Act of 1911 added that second summons quoted on the middle of my page. 
    Another defect and a more serious one in the research set out on my brief is that I should have shown how long these two provisions, Section 17 and Section 22 of the original Judiciary Act, remained hand in hand in the Judicial Code. 
    They remained there together until 1948 under when reversal was passed. 
    No member of that original Congress so far as the debate show as shown by Charles Warren his famous article “New light on the history of the Judiciary Act”, which upon which this Court based its decision in Erie Railroad against Tompkins, overruling Swift against Tyson. 
    This article takes up to debate section by section, and it discloses that there was no debate whatsoever about this Section 17. 
    Everybody agreed that the Courts of Appeals like the District Courts or trial courts should have the power to grant throughout --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2493.776" stopTime="2495.535">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="sidney_s_alderman" startTime="2495.535" stopTime="2615.618">
    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    -- then Circuit Courts, and this Court. 
    And there was no debate about it. 
    That original Congress saw no conflict between the provision of Section 22 and the provision of Section 17. 
    One was dealing with the question of law. 
    The other was dealing with the matter in fact as the old language had it. 
    But one article clearly discloses that the purpose of Section 22 in the Original Act was identical with the purpose of the Seventh Amendment, merely, to prevent the Courts of Appeals from ruling or reversing on pure questions of fact as distinguished from questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact. 
    Or, not only was I think those two documents, the first judiciary act and the first ten amendments or the -- proposed first twelve passed by the same Congress constitute probably the most extraordinary mutual contemporaneous practical construction of each other by two documents in all history that I know of. 
    Not only does it clearly appear that there was no conflict between Section 17 and 22 in the most rabid anti-federalist never raised his voice against Section 17 declaring that all of the said Courts of the United States shall have the power to grant a new trial. 
    But Congress evidently saw no conflict between the two and both of them remained in the Judicial Code until 1948. 
    And I do think that that's a considerable significance as bearing on the historical problem.

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    Now I think the -- of course, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said the -- the constitutional problem while it lurks in this case is here. 
    If Congress hasn't got the Constitution filed to confer this jurisdiction on the Courts of Appeals of the United States, of course, he can't do it and you can't construe the sections which I have referred to as conferring about it. 
    I based my argument on the constitutional point squarely on Galloway against United States, the most recent case in which this Court has dealt with the Seventh Amendment problem. 
    In that case Mr. Justice (Inaudible) writing for this Court, absolutely fairly assimilated as raising exactly equivalent questions of law subject to appellate review that the merit of the evidence the motion to set aside the verdict for a new trial and motion for direction of verdict and one other as raising exactly equivalent questions of law. 
    This Court held that there was no inconsistency between an appellate court dealing with that kind of question of law in the Seventh Amendment. 
    And throughout that case, depending of this Court stresses the fact that's led the practice applies to a motion for a new trial to set aside the verdict and for new trial equally with direction of verdict for one of the sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict and they all (Inaudible) to the evidence. 
    I take a careful consideration of that case in the light of this case will answer any constitution problem. 
    I think it all really comes down to one thing. 
    What is the question of law and what is what counsel referred to as a factual question? 
    Or, what is a pure question of fact? 
    I don't know of any questions of law that arise except directly or indirectly out of factual situation. 
    If that were not true, there would be very little for this Court or any other appellate court to decide these questions of law if you could not deal with a question which directly or indirectly proceeds from factual considerations. 
    But in my opinion for a United States Court of Appeals to review and reverse a district trial judge for abuse of discretion on the ground that he has approved the verdict and refuse to set it aside which is not warranted by the evidence and write in the case and it's beyond the bail of all reasonableness is distinctly a question of law. 
    If that'd be true and I feel that it is, there's no violation of the Seventh Amendment for the very same reason that there's no violation of -- even the original provision 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. 
    I feel that the decision in the Galloway case is dispositive of this case on both questions. 
    The constitutional question and in the statutory question here. 
    And I submit that the decision below should be affirmed. 
    And this -- that this Court certainly should not hold that there is no appellate jurisdiction in the federal judiciary to review a trial judge for abuse of discretion on a question of criminal verdict. 
    And I do invite your consideration of my review of the Court of Appeals decisions of all of the circuits. 
    The ten circuits and the circuit for the District of Columbia which have been handed down since the Fairmount case in 1933, which is the last point in my brief.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Alderman, suppose the, suppose the Court in this case said -- it said that it considered that $50 a month would've been all that was reasonable and they had had decided on that basis rather than $100 a month. 
    Would you think then that that was something that this Court should take cognizance of?

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman 
    I doubt very much, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court of Appeals can pick out one figure and direct the District Court what judgment he must approved on it, the Court of Appeals viewed this from a legal standpoint and estimated the evidence to find a range of reasons, it didn't pick out a particular and I doubt very much its power to do it. 
    It reversed the District Court and sent it back to let the jury do that under proper instructions again from the District Court.

    The Fifth Circuit has done that in several cases. 
    They have added an additional remittitur to their remittitur in the lower court. 
    I'd be somewhat dubious about defending that. 
    But merely for the Court of Appeals to reverse for abusive discretion and send back for a jury trial on the issue of damages alone, it seems to me it would be exceedingly grave for this Court to hold that there is no such appellate jurisdiction in the federal judiciary.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Alderman, I -- I don't want to labor it too far, but what I would like to ask is this. 
    Is there in your opinion, is there any limit upon the Court of Appeals in reversing the District Court for refusing to grant a new trial? 
    And if in this case, the Court had assumed that $50 was enough for as much as could have been expected to come from this boy and his parents? 
    And it stated that in the opinion as it did here, the $100 basis, would you say that that is a matter we could concern ourselves with or if not $50, say $40 or $30 or $20 or $10 or any other amount, is there any limit?

    Mr. Sidney S. Alderman

   Argument of Henry Hammer

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you Mr. Alderman. 
    Mr. Hammer.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="3468.240" stopTime="3617.990">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    May it please the Court. 
    I listened carefully to my opponent's argument wherein he says, that the congressional amendments to the Judiciary Act as work they changed in the rule against non-review. 
    I can't find no place in any of those enactments where Congress says that a federal appellate court can review the factual findings of a jury. 
    In fact, if they said that, it certainly would be unconstitutional under the Seventh Amendment. 
    And moreover, I call to the Courts attention to the chief revises notes on Title 28, the Federal Judiciary Code, of the Honorable William M.Barron, who is the co-author of Barron &amp; Holtzoff of the book Federal Practice and Procedure. 
    And therein, he says this in no uncertain language, I haven't cited in my brief but it's stated in Volume 2 at page 809. 
    He says this. 
    And this is a statement made after the adoption of the federal codes or after the revision of the federal codes, "The principle that in a law action, the question of damages cannot be reexamined in an the appellate court for excessiveness or insufficiency, still applies in jury cases because of the Seventh Amendment for the Constitution." 
    That clearly expresses the intent of Congress in passing the Judicial Code or revising the Judicial Code.

    Is that in your brief, Mr. -- ?

    Would you send -- send it to us please in form of a memo, enough copies of the Court.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="3628.594" stopTime="3821.386">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    I will, sir. 
    And moreover, the -- at the time of the revision, facts found by a trial judge sitting without a jury were not subject to review. 
    But we'll admit that the revision did contemplate, that a federal appellate court could review facts found by a trial judge, provided however, that was not in a case where there was a jury trial. 
    A counsel makes the statement to this Court. 
    That the cases prohibiting federal review were based upon case law. 
    I disagree with that statement thoroughly. 
    Again, I wish to call the Court's attention, to the earliest Supreme Court decision, we have found on a subject. 
    In Parsons versus Bedford, cited in our brief. 
    There, a bill of exceptions was complained of. 
    The trial court's refusal of appellant's application to one of the clerks to record their testimony. 
    On this application, the Court said, a whole lot therefore, of the application to the record to record the evidence, so far as at least as this Court can take cognizance of it, was to present the evidence here in order to establish the error of the verdict in matters of fact. 
    And the Court went on to say, that this assignment was immaterial, because of the prohibition of the Seventh Amendment. 
    The Court couldn't consider in any event whether it was part of the record or not part of the record. 
    And we quote, "but the other clause of the amendment is still more important, and we read it at a substantial and independent clause to ethical, no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examinable in any Court of the United States then according to the rules of the common law." 
    This is a prohibition to the courts of the United States to reexamine any facts tried by a jury in any other manner. 
    The only modes known to the common law, to reexamine such facts or the granting of a new trial by the Court where the issue was tried or to which the record was properly returnable, or the award of the venire facias de novo by an appellate court for some error of law which intervene in the proceedings.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3821.386" stopTime="3823.000">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now what citation is that please?
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="3823.000" stopTime="4093.457">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    That's Parsons versus Bedford. 
    It's referred to on page 5 of our reply brief, 3 Peterson 443, a decision by Mr. Justice Story. 
    And in the decision of Railroad Company versus (Inaudible) decided by Mr. Justice Harlan, it quoted this clause, the decision of the -- of the Parsons case and relied on the fact that the constitutional prohibition does not permit a federal appellate court to review federal facts. 
    Now my -- I would also like to call the Court's attention to the history of the enactment of the Seventh Amendment. 
    As indicating, that it was a matter of concern at that time, to the people to have the right of trial by jury and at no fact shall be examinable in any court of United States and according to the common law. 
    When the final draft of the Constitution as transmitted from the constitutional convention to Congress in 1785 was submitted -- it provided this, and I quote. 
    I don't have that in my brief and I'm sorry. 
    "In all other cases before I mention the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make." 
    In the federal's papers, Number 81, Hamilton pointed out this strong opposition, to allowing of appellate review of matters of fact, and then to finally meet the objections. 
    Congress passed the Seventh Amendment providing that no fact filed by jury shall be reexamined by any court other than the rules of the common law. 
    If the common law permitted a reexamination, and reexamination is permitted under the Seventh Amendment. 
    That's how strong the feeling was at that time against an appellate court exercising a review of factual questions. 
    And we submit, that Mr. Justice Brandeis' decision clearly indicates in the Fairmount case, that decision is rested as one of the reasons upon the prohibition of the Seventh Amendment. 
    Now referring to the other question which my opponent has posed to this Court, that is whether we have presented the question properly to this Court. 
    As Mr. Chief Justice Warren pointed out, we argued the case fully in our petition for writ of error -- petition for writ of certiorari. 
    We argued the facts, we talked about the facts, and we showed how the facts indicated that there was error on the part of the Court of Appeals. 
    And we also call the Court's attention that in the brief in our position --

    And the brief in our position, to the petition for writ of certiorari, the matter was fully argued by respondent. 
    And how in this Court determine a question, the questions which we pose, unless they consider the subsidiary question within the meaning and intent, as I read it of the Rule 41 (d) (1) of this Court, of considering the facts in this case, it would leave the decision of this nature in a broader state.
