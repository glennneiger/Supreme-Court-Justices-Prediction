Michel v. Louisiana
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="0.000" stopTime="190.265">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    (Inaudible) by the grand jury in 1950. 
    He was not informed of the indictment against him. 
    He was not arrested on the alleged crime until October of 1952. 
    The time had proscribed -- long proscribed when he was arrested and brought to the jurisdiction, the court of Louisiana jurisdiction. 
    That was a year and seven months. 
    The time had expired already when he was placed in the Parish Prison. 
    When he was placed in the Parish prison, the case was set for arraignment for October 25th. 
    He was brought down the 3rd of October. 
    He was set for the 25th of October, 1952 and I was retained the afternoon of the 24th. 
    So, on the morning of the 25th, on arraignment, I went to Court. 
    And I asked the Court for a continuance of the arraignment for the purpose of allowing me to file pleadings in the case. 
    On -- the Court granted me until November 7, 1952 to file those pleadings. 
    On November the 7th, 1952, we appeared in Court and we filed our motion to quash the indictment. 
    The -- when we filed the motion to quash the indictment, the State asked for a continuance. 
    And the Court granted them until November 17th to their continuance to answer of filing the pleadings in answer to my motion to quash. 
    On November -- on November 17th, 1952, the State filed its demurrer to my motion to quash claiming that the -- the motion was filed too late. 
    Now, the only difference between my case and the case of Michel and Labat is that my client Poret wasn't even arrested. 
    He didn't have counsel at the time that -- the time limit expired. 
    He had three days after March the 5th, 1951. 
    That is until March the 8th. 
    He had until March the 8th, 1951, to file his motion to quash under Article 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    That the man was not arrested.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Well, he was out of the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    That's -- that's correct, sir. 
    Yes, sir. 
    He was in a penitentiary in Tennessee during the part of that time. 
    And the State of Louisiana attempted to get him back from the penitentiary of Tennessee. 
    And the State of Tennessee refused the extradition and said that he would have to stay there until he served his time.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I filed a motion for a severance and the district attorney took the witness stand and said that he was not going to use a confession. 
    I filed my motion on the ground that Labat had committed -- confessed. 
    And he had involved Poret in his confession. 
    That was the basis to my motion for a severance. 
    And when the district attorney took the witness stand and said he was not going to use a confession in the trial of the case, there was no need for a motion for a severance because that was the basis of my motion, was that they were going to use confession of Labat.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    That fact might be possible (Inaudible)
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="274.853" stopTime="374.967">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Actually -- actually sir, I would say yes. 
    But the case against Labat was fixed for trial two or three times before Poret's incarceration or his arrest. 
    The case was fixed for trial. 
    I think at one time, according to the record, while Poret was in the penitentiary in Tennessee. 
    And it was continued one time by the State I believe and one time by the defense, if that answers Justice Clark's question. 
    But in this case, in Poret's case, he had no opportunity, whatsoever, to file his motion to quash before the time limit expired. 
    Under our jurisdiction, the purpose of an arraignment is to inform the accused of what he is being tried for. 
    That's the purpose of the arraignment. 
    Is to inform him of the case and the nature of the charges against him. 
    So, that I say that in the case of Poret that he was denied due process of law. 
    This much, as the time limit had expired a long time, a year and seven months before he was ever brought to the jurisdiction of Louisiana. 
    And surely while he was in the penitentiary in Tennessee, he couldn't obtain counsel to defend the case in Louisiana.

    And that upon inquiries, he was told that Poret was not there. 
    He went back a second time looking for Poret and was told again that Poret was not there and that they hadn't seen Poret. 
    But the State offered no evidence, whatsoever, to show why Poret if he left -- left the jurisdiction all of that the city in New Orleans.

    The Court doesn't control their fixing of cases. 
    The district attorney fixes the case for trial and he fixes the arraignments also for a hearing.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    No, sir. 
    There is no -- I have no authority. 
    There's no statute for him to have extra time. 
    The law is silent on it. 
    But I take their position that unless the defendant is informed of an indictment, there's no possible way for him to know. 
    You just -- people just don't go down in the court house when the grand jury returns and indictment comes with returns of indictment to see if there's any indictment return against them. 
    The ordinary procedure is that when the indictment is returned, a warrant of arrest issues and that informs that warrant of arrest, informs the defendant as to the crime for which he is to stand trial. 
    And if that is done, then I say that he, under the Wilson case he would have until the third judicial day after the grand jury time.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I would say yes. 
    In other words, an individual to be charged with the laxity would have to know something of the -- of the crime that he's going to be charge with. 
    Here, you have a man that's -- that's out of the jurisdiction of the Court entirely. 
    You discover him out of the jurisdiction. 
    When you do discover him --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Would that not make your rule then if the -- if he -- he must answer within the term of the grand jury or three days thereafter or such later time as he hears about it?
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="1014.858" stopTime="1075.926">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Well, I'd -- I would say that -- that we have Article 285 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that if the time has expired for him to file his motion to quash that he he'd -- he would have up until the arraignment to file his motion to quash. 
    You see, we have several articles pertaining to motions to quash time limits. 
    In answer to your question sir, if the grand jury that indicted -- indict him under the -- the reading of the of the statute, we'll say that three judicial days of the time which would be the first three days of the grand jury time. 
    If the grand jury indicted the individual on the fifth to sixth day of the time, obviously, if the crime was committed after that, after that third day had expired, obviously, we wouldn't have an opportunity to file his motion to quash.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Last three days. 
    Now, there is another article of our Code which is article 285 which also says that, if his case goes to trial sooner than that time, he should file his motion to quash before arraignment. 
    In other words, they don't indict a person in Louisiana and then wait until the grand jury goes out of session and three days after that before the file. 
    It's very possible that the man could be indicted on March the 1st, 1951. 
    The grand jury goes out of office on the 8th and his trial would come up before the time limit expired. 
    It could be set for the 6th of March or the 5th of -- before the 8th day of March could be set. 
    Now then, he would file his motion to quash before arraignment or at arraignment.

    All right.
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="1409.682" stopTime="1457.193">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    -- if the Court pleases. 
    One point that Mr. Justice -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised earlier about the question of why this man wasn't tried for so long and I think Mr. Justice Clark, has given the same answer which I would. 
    And I don't mean to -- to explain the delay or excuse it. 
    We were not in the office at the time. 
    I don't really know. 
    But I do know that the trial was continued on two occasions and that about a year before the trial was held. 
    And about at the time of the last continuance or a little while before that they were notified. 
    The state was that this man would be available, the codefendant for prosecution in Louisiana, within a reasonable time after that last continuance. 
    And apparently the decision was made then that it was better to wait a few more months than to try, to try the two of them separately. 
    So that that's --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1457.193" stopTime="1465.018">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is -- is there any statute in your State requiring a man to be tried within a given number of days and yet it's according --

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    -- which we constantly fight. 
    Which we're aware of and which we are working to (Inaudible) we -- we are working very hard at. 
    There's no statute that I know of. 
    We do have a constitutional provision that a defendant can insist upon a speedy trial. 
    And he has the right to file a motion to go trial himself because as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, good teachers of criminal law teach that every day of delay is beneficial to the defendant.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    He's a good former of district attorney, excuse me, Mr. Justice. 
    The second point that -- that Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised and I -- and I can well agree that I too would be concerned if these were a singling out of a particular defendant, that the State had decided, well, now we're going -- we're going to use 202 in this case and we never have used it before, but we're going to use it. 
    I'd like state to the Court that in the 18 months during which we have prosecuted in the New Orleans, there hasn't been a single instance in which a motion to quash was filed after the delay provided in Article 202. 
    So that certainly, for the last 18 months, it's safe to say that no counsel has allowed the time of three days beyond the grand jury term to expire without filing these motions. 
    And there have been some of them filed. 
    But there has not been one single instance where they have been filed too late. 
    And I think that's important because I think it shows that in the great many cases, these things are filed timely and that the reason why there's not more jurisprudence in -- in Louisiana Supreme Court, on 202, is that there are only few cases in which counsel have not filed these things timely.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    But my -- my point is that lack of these things in the last 18 months means that there probably weren't many before it. 
    Hence, no demurrers. 
    Hence no 202. 
    Now, with respect to Poret's claim that this -- this is a non-constitutional application of Article 202 because he was not in the jurisdiction because he wasn't notified because he wasn't arrested. 
    I suggest to the Court, first of all, that the record at leaves no room for doubt that Poret was a fugitive. 
    There are -- there's a -- there's ample evidence in the record that not only the -- the criminal sheriff who was our counterpart (Inaudible), not only that office, but the police department made constant and persistent efforts to locate this man. 
    There's a return of the deputy sheriff indicating that he had been told. 
    I think that's in the record if I'm not mistaken. 
    That he had been told by this man's relatives that he had left the day after this crime was committed. 
    There is additional evidence which is not in this record in the lower court upon which the state court made its finding both the District Court and the Supreme Court that Poret was a fugitive. 
    Now, this wasn't made without any opportunity to Poret to prove to the Court that he was not in fact a fugitive, but that it was in good faith in leaving the jurisdiction. 
    There was a hearing held at which the defense had a right to present any evidence that it wanted to on the question of whether or not he was a fugitive. 
    And unless my recollection is wrong, Poret presented no evidence, not his own anyone else's. 
    And all of the evidence presented by the State indicated that he was in fact a fugitive from justice.

    The Court went into the question of whether he was not a fugitive.

    What was the proof -- what was the proof of being a fugitive?
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="1829.612" stopTime="1891.115">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    The proof is that -- that the sheriff's office made several attempts almost immediately after this crime to locate him at a place where he was known to have lived. 
    He wasn't there. 
    The return of the sheriff is with an advice that he left. 
    He left yesterday. 
    This was a day after the crime. 
    And the police department and the district attorney's office testified, we tried to find this man. 
    We did everything we could. 
    He was nowhere to be located. 
    Now, this is a native of New Orleans. 
    He turns up at the Tennessee penitentiary. 
    And I suggest to the Court if the State absent to defend in his own testimony could never do any better than that than to show that here's a man who's living in this jurisdiction until the date that he commits a crime. 
    He leaves the next day. 
    We tried to find him consistently. 
    We can't locate him and he turns up in the penitentiary in Tennessee. 
    And I -- and I suggest that that's ample evidence that he was in fact a fugitive, especially, when you consider that he introduced nothing at all to rebut that. 
    Makes no serious argument before the Supreme Court of Louisiana that he wasn't a fugitive. 
    None in his brief here. 
    No evidence of it.

    Supreme Court of Louisiana did and bases its conclusion that 202 runs even in the absence of an arrest because he was a fugitive.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Yes, sir. 
    But over and above that, I think that if you examine the -- the rationale of the Wilson decision that where the Court goes into, why we have 202. 
    And remember, Mr. Justice Black, the 202 does not apply only to grand jury. 
    The attacks on grand jury is based on federal grounds. 
    Our grand jurors have to read and write. 
    They have to be a citizen of the State. 
    There are many, many other qualifications. 
    And if you can do this thing two years later, the State is simply not going to be able to justify the panel of its grand jury. 
    And if the defendant as the Supreme Court of Louisiana pointed out can extend this time simply by fleeing, if he's a -- if he's a good fleer, he can -- he can extend it to the point that we could never justify the grand jury.

    I would -- I would like -- just one more question and I hope not to bother you anymore during your argument. 
    But suppose a man was indicted on the last day of the term. 
    And for some reason or other whether it was the inactivity of the sheriff or activity on the part of the -- the person who is accused or whatever it might be, for some reason or other, a warrant was not served for four days. 
    Then the defendant was arrested and brought into court, would it be incumbent upon him to establish that he had not been trying to avoid arrest during those three to four days in order to be -- to have available to him, a motion to quash the indictment for the reasons that you're here now.

    -- be incumbent upon the State to prove that he's -- he was a fugitive. 
    I might add one other thing. 
    And I'm just, of course.guessing more or less what the Supreme Court of Louisiana would do. 
    But I -- I guess it because of what Mr. Hubert has characterized this meticulous concern for federal rights and they have evidenced it. 
    That in the Michel case, the Court indicated that had it found no appointment of counsel on March 2nd that they --that they may have reached a different result because they recognized, of course, the federal right to counsel. 
    This Court has held that a man's entitled to counsel. 
    And in this case, the Supreme Court goes into the question of whether he is a fugitive as of indicating to me that they may reach a different result if the proof is different on the question of fugitive here. 
    If he's not a fugitive, the Court might reach a different result.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2545.500" stopTime="2558.702">

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    No. 
    But I think that -- that I can -- I can bridge that gap for this. 
    That 202 makes no exceptions. 
    202 says that if you don't file it within three days that is the end. 
    And the State is not here claiming that we are reading into 202 something which makes it apply to a fugitive. 
    202 on its face applies to everyone. 
    This defendant is here asking and asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to read into 202 an exception with respect to fugitives which Louisiana Supreme Court refused to do and I suggest probably so.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I would answer that the same way that I think the Louisiana Supreme Court indicated by its very finding that that this man was a fugitive. 
    That if a situation is presented, where a man has not himself contributed to this thing, that they would reach a different result. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I -- I would answer that the same way.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If he just locked himself up in his house and -- and refused to admit anyone.

speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="2633.504" stopTime="2639.894">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Well, if -- if his locking prevented an arrest, I think that's correct. 
    And I suggest that it is.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2639.894" stopTime="2640.928">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I just want to know --
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="2640.928" stopTime="2827.948">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I think that it ought to be. 
    I'd like to -- to pass from this point of whether he's a fugitive which I think is amply -- amply justified to the second point which the Supreme Court of Louisiana passed upon. 
    On this particular question, I'd like to read from page 21 of our brief. 
    It's just short and it will take a minute. 
    In answer to Poret's objection, you can't apply 202 to me because he says, “I don't know anything about this indictment and therefore, it's unconstitutional to file against me.” 
    “It's not true,” says the Supreme Court." 
    And I think the reasoning is -- is very fine. 
    That the defendant Poret was denied an opportunity to file his motion timely. 
    He was indicted on December 11, 1950, had until March 8, 1951, a period of almost three months in which to file his motion to quash. 
    Now, why -- why didn't he file it? 
    His own actions to avoid for prosecution caused him not to avail himself for the right to challenge the jury. 
    This is a choice which he exercised, says the Supreme Court. 
    During this time, he could have filed a motion. 
    He was a fugitive by his own choice and will. 
    If we concede that his flight made it impossible for him to file a motion timely, he himself knew about the situation which made it impossible. 
    To our minds, it would be improper to hold that the prescriptive period provided on the statute is applicable to the accused held under arrest within the jurisdiction of the Court, but is not applicable to the accused, who of his own will, the Court has absconded to avoid prosecution. 
    Such a holding would be tantamount to rewarding the absconding person for his right. 
    Moreover, the article provides for prescriptive theory which runs against the accused and he can't by any acts of his own extend the time provided for in this statute. 
    Now, I suggest that actually what this gets itself down to is this. 
    The Supreme Court of Louisiana has found that there is no exception to 202 with respect to fugitives. 
    And on a well recognized principle which we've already discussed, this Court, I think will accept that finding, unless -- unless it's unreasonable and unless it's designed to -- to hurt -- to -- to deprive somebody of a federal right. 
    And unless it's unreasonable. 
    Then it violates the due process. 
    The issue gets down to this. 
    Is it unreasonable? 
    Is it unconstitutional for the State of Louisiana to refuse to reward someone who is a fugitive because he was successful in his flight? 
    It gets down to that narrow point. 
    Is it unreasonable or is it therefore unconstitutional for the State of Louisiana to provide that a fugitive shall not get any special privileges by reason of the fact that he's a fugitive. 
    Congress does virtually the same thing. 
    And we cite the -- the statute of limitations and everyone that I could find says the same thing. 
    We treat certain people, if you're not prosecuted within the certain time, you can't prosecute. 
    What about a fugitive? 
    Congress says that we're going to reward him because he pled no. 
    That statute of limitations will not apply to a fugitive. 
    I can find -- and I could find none that does and I submit that the logic behind that statute of limitation, certainly it's a different thing. 
    But the logic behind the refusal to reward a fugitive is as applicable here. 
    The Supreme Court says we are faced with this problem. 
    Will we reward a fugitive? 
    And says, "No, we will not." 
    And this Court must be told that it's refusal to reward a fugitive is unconstitutional.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2827.948" stopTime="2830.056">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What do you mean by reward?
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="2830.056" stopTime="2872.102">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Reward him because he gets -- if -- if Your Honor, if I can state this -- the rationale of 202 again in the Wilson case. 
    The State's in a better position to justify the composition of its grand jury. 
    It has a judge there who'll may be dead later on. 
    It has the jurors there, who may have left the jurisdiction. 
    There are many, many reasons why, at an early stage, the State can better justify the composition of a grand jury. 
    Now, if a defendant can flee and -- and thereby extend the period provided in 202, he gets the real reward. 
    Because the State may not have available information and it's likely that it won't, which it would have had available, had he not fled and had the theory provided 202 run against them. 
    That's what I say.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I get that. 
    But I get back to the question that Justice Black who asked you.

    If you're not prosecuted with a certain term, you can't be.

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Pardon me? 
    I only step back one step at a time. 
    Now, I'd like to get for just one moment to the question of -- of this petition of Labat and his contention that he wasn't represented by effective counsel. 
    I'd -- I'd like to call the Court's attention to something you already have noticed. 
    That Mr. Mahoney was supported about two months before the grand jury time I think. 
    He did nothing conceded -- concededly until about a year and two months later when he got out of the case. 
    But he was in the case for over two months while its prescriptive period in 202, the statute of limitations was running. 
    We call the Court's attention in brief to several cases from the Circuit Courts of Appeal where the Courts have held and I suggest properly. 
    Number one, first of all, that there's a presumption that counsel was confident. 
    Man is licensed to practice law, we assume in the absence of the showing to the contrary that he is competent. 
    Secondly, that his incompetence must be such as to shock the conscience of the Court before the Court would set aside proceedings on the ground of ineffective counsel. 
    He must make, says -- says the Circuit Court a sham and a mockery of the proceedings. 
    Now, with this background, what have we here to indicate whether or not Mr. Mahoney was effective, whether he was a competent counsel? 
    The only thing in the record to indicate that is the Supreme Court of Louisiana's language which we quote in our brief which the Supreme Court has never said about me or about a lot of lawyers whom I know. 
    And which the Supreme Court of Louisiana said, mind you, not in just complimenting Mr. Mahoney that he's a nice fellow or was, but because there was an attack made upon him in the Supreme Court of Louisiana that he was not competent and ineffective and what does the Court say? 
    Able, learned, distinguished counsel, there's the Court which licenses him and regulates him in his law practice. 
    Would you --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3243.959" stopTime="3248.550">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Mr. Duplantier, does the Court say that he did anything?

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I'm going to get to that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3249.111" stopTime="3264.235">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Man -- man can be an able, conscientious lawyer and he might under given circumstances do nothing for -- now all I ask is and I don't argue and all I'll ask you is what does the record show that he did for this?
speaker="adrian_g_duplantier" startTime="3264.235" stopTime="3399.131">
    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Well I've already stated that the record shows that he did nothing for a year and two months. 
    And I was about to demonstrate I hope that if -- that that was the best thing in the world that Mr. Mahoney could do for this man, the best thing in the world. 
    And in retrospect, if I were representing him, I'd have done exactly the same thing. 
    And why was it? 
    Because what could Mr. Mahoney have done inside of this period of a year and two months. 
    Come into Court and say, I realized I've got an electric chair case, it's a very tough case on the facts and I realize that the State witnesses might die or leave the jurisdiction or get caught and that the facts may not be able to be proved in a year, but I want you to try my man tomorrow. 
    That's what he could have done. 
    He could have said, "I want you to put this man in trial, right now." 
    Now, aside from that, the only other thing he could have done was file this motion to quash. 
    And I'd like to examine what the result of that would be. 
    Assuming that the motion to quash was time -- was timely filed and then it was valid. 
    It would result in a finding by the District Court, and counsel was called in the Court's attention to the fact that at least one our judges has so found that the grand jury was improperly (Inaudible). 
    So then what happens? 
    I suggest that within a period of a very short time, this man would be indicted again by a valid grand jury. 
    But, instead of that what does Mr. Mahoney do? 
    And as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, I -- he made very well and all the counsel in this case made very well. 
    I don't say that it was true but it could be may very well have reached the positive determination. 
    I would rather not file this thing timely and why? 
    Because if I don't' file it timely, then I can attack 202 as being unconstitutional after my trial. 
    Then I'll get a trial by petit jury and I'll take my chances. 
    I might get a good verdict from that jury. 
    If I don't, I haven't lost anything because then I'm not effective counsel. 
    I haven't done anything, 202 doesn't hurt him and as a result he gets another trial and another chance at a good jury verdict. 
    So that I suggest that it -- it's --its as -- as indicative of strategy and instigation to not to file this motion, as it is to file it.

    Petitioner asked this Court to file but because Mr. Mahoney didn't file this motion, that's it -- that's the only thing he could have done, except to bring his man to the trial and how they offer verdict. 
    That's the only thing he could have done. 
    And counsel asked this Court to be -- to go pretty far to hold that a man in the Supreme Court of Louisiana described he's able, competent, and experienced, learned, that's he's ineffective counsel such as to shock the conscience of the Court because he doesn't file a motion to quash. 
    An indictment based upon --

    Well, Mr. Mahoney couldn't they have gotten anything much by delay by filing to Court --

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    Let me state that Mr. Mahoney may have known that the grand jury was in fact properly constituted. 
    I don't know. 
    He may have known that it was. 
    We can't assume that it was not and that he just sat by and so I'm going to let this man lose his rights. 
    He cannot assume that. 
    So that, the mere lack of filing of this motion is suggested as sufficient reason for finding by this Court that Mr. Mahoney is not effective counsel. 
    And if that's true, when does 202 ever have any application? 
    Every time somebody doesn't file it, the defendant didn't have effective counsel, so the Court releasing of the limitation provided in 202 and 202 never applies to anybody because we just don't ever file them until the three days are up and then he had no effective counsel because it wasn't raised. 
    And therefore, the limitation doesn't apply against him. 
    He has not been represented by effective counsel.

    As far as I remember, Mr. Mahoney and of course I've been told by the people he wasn't in bed when this two months was running. 
    And certainly he wasn't in bed the day the Court consulted him and said, "Will you take the support with Mr. Mahoney?"

    Mr. Adrian G. Duplantier 
    I would try to be very brief, Your Honors. 
    First of all, with regard to the fact that perhaps Mr. Mahoney in doing nothing for this client was engaging in some significant strategy. 
    I wish to call, Your Honors attention to the statement made by the district attorney on page 25 of this brief. 
    He says, "Mahoney may have determined that such an attack would be in vain since he may have known as a fact that there had been no systematic exclusion. 
    I submit that the district attorney in -- in making that statement in his brief is contrary to judicially admitted facts of the newspaper or articles which reported our brief showing that it's as a matter of common knowledge that at least there's a prima facie case in Louisiana for showing that there's discrimination in the selection of grand jury. 
    It's a common knowledge. 
    I have newspapers all over the place but I have quoted one of them in my brief which I think succinctly -- states the point. 
    Now, I submit that if Mr. Mahoney tried to do the other thing and that is say well, I'll let my client's rights pass. 
    I've got a capital case. 
    This man may be electrocuted but I'm going to let this delays run and then I'll come and try to -- to confuse the Court and maybe get a writ out of the Supreme Court. 
    I submit that that statement of its very nature would indicate that that Mr. Mahoney, if he did that, well then he didn't know what he was doing and certainly he wasn't an effective counsel. 
    He was -- was ineffective. 
    If -- if he tried to let a -- a substantial delay when he had a prima facie case, a matter of common knowledge, a matter of -- I would say that the Courts -- the Criminal District Court of the Parish of Orleans takes judicial cognizance of the fact that at least there's a prima case of discrimination on juries and the lawyer lets it pass in the hope of getting some type of writ from this Court of something. 
    I -- I just would.

    Yes, but at least I would say that if I have a prima facie case of an unconstitutional grand jury indicting my client, and I have a means of procedure whereby I can get a constitutional grand jury then I certainly as astute counsel should file the motion and have my client indicted by a constitutional grand jury.

    In other way, the substantial -- although the codefendants have tried at the same time, there are substantial factual differences in the question of Article 202 that if Your Honors should see fit to remand Poret's case, then under the law, Your Honors should also remand this case.
