    Mr. Caughlan, you may proceed.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="11.534" stopTime="163.089">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    A question was raised just before the recess as to whether or not a hearing is mandatory under Section 244 of the Act. 
    Whether or not a hearing is mandatory, we submit that there -- it is contrary to the expressed intent of Congress to permit the use of confidential information in connection with the suspension proceedings. 
    When Congress intended to authorize the use of confidential information, it had no difficulty in expressing its intent unmistakably as witness Section 235 (c) of the Immigration Nationality Act, which is referred to on pages 37 and 38 of the Government brief, which relates to the question of exercise of discretion on the admission and that is on the exclusion of persons applying for admission and Congress explicitly stated that in such proceedings without any inquiry or without any further inquiry by a special inquiry officer, the Attorney General is authorized to use confidential information and not disclose it to the alien applicant. 
    On the contrary, as is already been pointed out, Section 244 of the Act which authorizes suspension of deportation specifically requires that Congress be furnished a -- with the reasons that suspension of deportation is granted. 
    The regulation challenge here, however, without differentiating says that whether it is granted or denied -- whether it is granted or denied it may be based upon confidential information. 
    Now, this violates a -- the other section of the statute which is -- the other section of regulations which we contend specifically are nullified --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Caughlan, before you get to that. 
    I don't quite get that -- your point on the reporting to Congress because they don't' report to Congress unless it's planted, unless his suspension is granted. 
    Now, if it's -- if it's denied to the applicant on -- on confidential information, it would never get -- never get to Congress. 
    So, how -- how does that manifest desire on the part of Congress to prevent a confidential information being used?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="195.251" stopTime="201.592">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the regulation which is here challenged --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="201.592" stopTime="222.736">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I thought you were -- I'm just talking about the Congress, you're -- you're talking about the intention of Congress and the fact that they -- that they didn't provide for it or they provide for listing all of the evidence on which it was based. 
    But it's only when -- when the ruling is favorable to the -- to the applicant that they do that.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="222.736" stopTime="265.465">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's true. 
    Our position is that Congress did not authorize the use of confidential information and the language of Section 244 (c) which requires a report when it is granted indicates that in such cases, certainly, Congress did not intend that the granting should be based upon confidential information. 
    That is it didn't intend the use confidential information in a suspension hearing where suspension is granted because if confidential information is used, Congress isn't being given the reasons that the suspension is granted.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="265.465" stopTime="291.759">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I -- I understood you to say -- I understood you to say that it made no difference whether a hearing was required or not, your position would be just the same. 
    Now, let's assume that there was no hearing provided for by the Attorney General then wouldn't he be free to act in his discretionary capacity on any information that he might have from any place as he would in the clemency proceeding?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="291.759" stopTime="325.192">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    That -- of course in that situation, I am apart from the question of congressional intent would deprive the alien of any right of appeal which is specifically granted to -- to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals on suspension of hearing, he has that specific right to apply to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    Under Section -- under the Regulation 6, 8 C.F.R.6.1, he has the right to appeal. 
    That right is wiped out.

    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Yes, that -- that -- Mr. Justice Clark, that would -- would be true but we feel while the due process issue as such isn't raised here, we feel that congressional intent as I've just outlined has indicated that the Attorney General wasn't authorized to use confidential information.

    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors. 
    I should like at the outset to correct if I may one or two impressions that may have been made by argument of counsel. 
    First of all, there was a reference by Mr. Maslow to the type of confidential information that is used pursuant to Regulation 244.3, the regulation in question in this case. 
    And the first -- first reference that he made was the testimony by one of the Immigration Service investigators to the effect that "some of these confidential reports were merely information we received off the street." 
    I wish that Mr. Maslow had seen fit to read the rest of that paragraph which goes as follows --

    Because the use of the confidential information in -- in this -- as prescribed by the Regulation 244.3 is limited to the confidences respected only in cases where it's necessary to protect the public interest, safety or security. 
    And I take it that what was being said here in the testimony that was referred to by Mr. Maslow's argument, I take it that what was really being said was that we don't consider that type of information, the type of information that is -- that is included within the scope of this regulation.

    I should like to -- to point out, however, that -- that the figures for last year of the cases appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, that there were 4000 deportation cases approximately. 
    Now, this is a rough estimate, out of a total of some 6000 cases that were considered by the Board. 
    Out of those cases, only 410% involves suspension. 
    Now, it is true that in approximately four-fifths of the so-called deportation cases that are heard, deportability is not contested. 
    The question is whether or not to give the alien voluntary departure which is quite different from suspension of deportation or suspension. 
    There's a good practical reason for not splitting up the hearing in this particular case. 
    There were -- there was one hearing, it was closed and then reopened again to consider the question of suspension of deportation. 
    But in most cases, there's no question about deportability and in most of the cases in which there's no question about deportability, the issue is whether or not the aliens to be given voluntary departure, that is to say allowed to leave the country freely without being deported in order that he will not be barred if he tries to reenter at a later date because he has been deported in the past. 
    Suspension does not require the alien to leave the country at all. 
    His status is adjusted and he is allowed to stay here as a permanent resident. 
    Now, I should also like to point out and this is mentioned in the Government's brief in a footnote that of the suspension of deportation cases, there's 10% of the number of total of deportation cases that confidential information, the Government is advised by the Board of Immigration Appeals from their records, is used in less than 5%. 
    Now, I should like to if I may to proceed to --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Lindsay, before you proceed, before you leave this subject, you commented on the testimony of one of these service investigators but you didn't comment on the evidence of the others. 
    Would you do that please and give us your version of that and I'm referring to 12 -- page 12 of this amicus brief that you pointed to. 
    The first one said that it was just merely information we received off the street and then it goes on. 
    The next one says described it as "what might be termed as hearsay evidence which could not be gotten into the record." 
    And then there's some following that, how do you --
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1084.823" stopTime="1085.847">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    That is true.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1085.847" stopTime="1086.732">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How do you explain that?
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1086.732" stopTime="1191.075">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    I explain it this way that on the question of eligibility for suspension of deportation, it is true that the normal rules of evidence apply in these -- in these hearings. 
    If it's a matter of hearsay, it will normally be excluded, there is confrontation. 
    All of the usual historical safeguards against arbitrary action are taken in the deportation proceedings. 
    When it -- and -- and -- I beg your pardon, they certainly are taking in deportation proceedings and the same is true in this discretionary relief of suspension of deportation. 
    But when it comes to the operation of the discretion, bear in mind that this discretionary power and this is the Government's position is so broad and so unique and so much of a blank check that the Congress has provided that it does not even become operative until the alien can show that he is eligible for this relief. 
    The reason -- and when the discretion does become operative, then it is the Government's position that the -- it is entirely within the legislative purpose that the Attorney General can take into consideration in making his decision any information that he deems appropriate and necessary providing he stays within the limits of the applicable regulations. 
    Now, this might include hearsay evidence. 
    It might include evidence that you couldn't get in, in a court of law and that is the type of information I believe that you're referring to, Mr. Chief Justice, on page 12.

    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Now, I don't say -- I don't go -- I go so far as to say that I think that the statute, that the Congress allows that same wide unbridled unfeathered discretion to operate in the actual case of qualification for a suspension of deportation. 
    But contrary to that, the Attorney General has chosen to prescribe for himself regulations which require the use of record information in determining the question of eligibility before the discretion becomes operative.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1253.301" stopTime="1292.814">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I think the thing that's bothering me is this -- is this one hearing that you have on the deportation and on the suspension. 
    Now, if the hearing officer can take into consideration not only the -- the evidence which is in the record but also any kind of hearsay testimony or -- or information he gets off the street or anything of that kind. 
    How can he differentiate between the suspension proceeding and the -- the deportation proceeding when he comes to make his determination as to whether a man should be deported on the record?
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1292.814" stopTime="1374.264">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, I'll -- I'll address myself to that. 
    In the relatively few cases in which deportability is in issue, the regulations -- the statute requires and the regulations conformed to the statue that every safeguard or procedural due process should be accorded to the alien and I'll refer to those. 
    Secondly, the statute also provides and the regulation is consistent that the decision of the special inquiry officer, which is appealable to the Board of Immigration Appeals, shall be based upon reasonable substantial and probative evidence which is on the record that the -- the alien has a right to take the decision which -- which is based only on the record to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    They take a look at it to see whether or not the record evidence was substantial, probative and -- and reasonable then he can go to court and that's what happened in this case. 
    This alien contested the issue of deportability. 
    He went to the special inquiry officer. 
    He went to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then he went to court. 
    And he lost in all three places.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1374.264" stopTime="1427.129">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But my point is this, in the deportation hearing, perhaps there is a conflict, direct conflict of -- of testimony. 
    The Government contends one thing, the -- the subject contends another and in that case I thought the hearing officer was suppose to give a fair and the impartial trial on that evidence. 
    But under these regulations, you permit him to go out on the street and get any kind of information he wants. 
    Any kind of hearsay that he wants, look into -- to the income tax reports and take the testimony of witnesses who don't' want to appear and let him use that in the proceeding to see whether he'll also recommend a suspension or not. 
    How can he separate the two?
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1427.129" stopTime="1428.932">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, he's -- he's required to separate the two --

    But can a man --

speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1430.883" stopTime="1477.518">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Because -- because the alien -- he is required to base his decision and make his findings on -- on information only and testimony only as to which the alien has access, may cross-examine, is given notice of and all the rest and it's on the record. 
    If the record doesn't support the finding of the special inquiry officer, without reference to any of this other material which may possibly at this point come in, in most cases it would come in after the issue of the deportability is decided and then you go into this other end of it. 
    But if it should and it's permissible that it might, if it should, the Board of Immigration Appeals is in a position to reverse it and if the Board of Immigration Appeals doesn't do it, the Court can do it.

    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, I -- I'll concede that point, but I -- but I will not concede that -- that in a hearing procedure on a question of eligibility, and we're not concerned with deportability, there's been no challenge to that here, not at all. 
    On the question of eligibility, the Attorney General isn't even required to hold a hearing -- a hearing and yet he does. 
    Now, I -- I cannot see that there's been a denial of procedural due process that has any relationship to the instant case because there was a deportation proceeding which preceded this and in this case the deportation proceeding did precede the proceeding having to do with suspension at which the alien was found deportable, found by the BIA, the Board of Immigration Appeals to be deported and found by the Court that the evidence was substantial, probative and reasonable on the record.

    -- that you've opened up, but I do not see the force of your point he'd been found deportable. 
    The argument is that having been found being deportable, Congress didn't' say therefore he should be deported. 
    Congress deposited some relieving power in the power of the Attorney General. 
    Congress didn't let the Attorney General to his own undisclosed, uncontested determination of whether you should have this right of litigation or not. 
    It doesn't follow because Congress could have passed a statute which left this in the unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General. 
    It doesn't follow that even he himself might have that power, that if he does formulate a scheme, a procedure for determining something that that procedure must have some rational relation to the end to be determined.

    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, now, let me address myself to that point. 
    First of all, I think it's important before we go any further on the -- on the question of what has the Attorney General done with respect to prescribing a hearing in this case to find out exactly what the nature of his power is that we're dealing with. 
    It is the Government's contention that suspension of deportation is an act of grace, that wherein otherwise fully deportable, admittedly deportable and mandatorily deportable alien is concerned that the Congress has vested in the Attorney General an unusually wide and somewhat unique discretionary power to withhold deportation.

speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1755.417" stopTime="1757.339">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that's -- that's a question I wanted to raise --
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1757.339" stopTime="1757.543">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1757.543" stopTime="1799.399">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    -- under -- if you turn to page 56 of your brief, 20 -- 244 (a) (5), ”He may suspend in his discretion in case of an alien who,” and then drop down into (5) and you'll find that says, "Who proves that during all of such period he has been.” 
    It apparently implies an opportunity to prove which makes it possible the argument that -- that he's entitled to a rehearing. 
    I'm not sure about that.
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="1799.399" stopTime="2027.965">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, I'd -- I'd like to answer that this -- this way. 
    As I read Section 244, the suspension provision, it provides as follows that as herein after prescribed in this Section, “The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation et cetera of an alien who is deportable for various reasons.” 
    And then it goes on and it gives the list of qualifications which are very stringent qualifications that must be met before this discretionary power becomes operative. 
    In other words, if you turn to (c), subparagraph (c) on the following page, “Upon application by any alien who is found by the Attorney General to meet the requirements of (4) or (5) of subsection (a), the Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation.” 
    In other words, Congress had a purpose to deport deportable aliens and it very carefully withdrew all discretion from the Attorney General when it came to that. 
    Section 241, the deportation section says that the Attorney General must deport and then list section after section of the most carefully spelled out provisions hitting aliens who the Congress has decided, whether or not we agree with the substantive grounds and as -- is not any of my business or the Court's business at this point, must be deported and it then goes on after saying in Section 241 that deportation must be affected of these aliens, it prescribes in Section 242 of the Act very careful procedures to effect this deportation. 
    Now, I'm referring to page 15 of the Government's brief in Footnote 10. 
    Note what the statute provides, “That the special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings that determination of deportability in any case shall be made only upon a record at which the -- the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to be present.” 
    Turning the page, “The Attorney General may prescribe regulations which shall include requirements that the alien shall be given notice of the charges, shall have the privilege of being represented, reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to present evidence on his own behalf, cross-examine and that this procedure so prescribed should be the solemn exclusive procedure.” 
    Now, this is deportation. 
    When it comes to suspension, the only thing that the Congress saw fit to say was that the Attorney General in four words “may, in his discretion,” suspend deportation. 
    The alien in order to be even qualified for this extraordinary relief is required to show that he meets these most stringent requirements. 
    Now, there may be lots of other aliens who have done -- committed no worst substantive offense perhaps less, who have got to leave the country but they can't meet these requirements. 
    My point is this then that Congress, knowing that it was giving the Attorney General a blank check and that it had to give the Attorney General a blank check in order to make this power useful or effective. 
    It -- it's no good unless it's as broad as it can possibly be for this reason, but you can't categorize cases where the Attorney General should grant the armor of clemency anymore than you can categorize the cases in which the Congress has seen fit to enact special bills.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2027.965" stopTime="2042.050">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, you can't do that but you can determine the procedure by which he can determine it and which enables you to meet it. 
    You're going to go in due course to the question whether -- although Congress left him free, he determined to setup the procedures.
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="2042.050" stopTime="2051.177">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, I would agree, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that the -- that the Court can take a look at the prescribed -- the prescribed procedure that the Attorney General has -- has promulgated.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2067.900" stopTime="2121.185">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Lindsay, may I ask you -- may I ask you this, under 244 (a) that's the -- that's the Section giving him the -- the Attorney General the discretion. 
    Let us assume that the deportee prove that he had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately following the commission of an act or the assumption of a status constituting a ground for deportation and proves that during all such period he has been and is a person of good moral character. 
    Do you believe that those things were shown that there was still an unlimited discretion in the Attorney General?
speaker="john_v_lindsay" startTime="2121.185" stopTime="2205.399">
    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    I do and let me quote to you just one sentence out of the Senate Committee report that accompanied this bill, “Technical compliance by the alien with the formal eligibility requirements does not necessitate a conclusion that he will be granted suspension of deportation.” 
    And there are cases which -- and that there are recent cases as a matter of fact in the District -- the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia. 
    One that is particularly note worthy where the special inquiry also did find that the alien met the minimum requirements of eligibility and he still -- the special inquiry officer still denied suspension of deportation on the question of hardship. 
    He said this meets the minimum requirement but he's got no family here, admittedly he claims that he will not be able to work if he gets deported, he doesn't know -- he can't speak the language and all the rest of it but still in the exercise of discretion, I deny suspension. 
    I am referring to the Melachrinos case in which the Court of Appeals for the district said this, he further found that while the appellant met the minimum statutory requirements so far as eligibility for suspension of deportation was concerned, suspension of deportation was not warranted and so forth. 
    Now --

    The Government's view of it is, is that it comes close to being as broad as the power of the President, Chief Executive in granting a pardon.

    You've got in a way the same considerations here and after all the Congress was sick to death of enacting private bills and it gave this broad power to the Attorney General to take an alien who's got to leave, the Congress has said he's got to leave and arbitrarily say, "No, you can stay because it's going to be hardship on you or your wife." 
    The same thing is done by the Congress when it enacts a private bill and this is suggestive to me of a political power, not adjudicated power. 
    The very fact that is made reviewable by the Congress, the suspension, the granting of this -- of this clemency is made reviewable by the Congress, to me is suggestive of a political power. 
    And that is why I say that this particular type of discretion, although it is limited to the extent that if it affirmatively appears that its exercise has been so arbitrary or capricious that nobody can swallow it, that it is just short of that and that it is almost -- or it's analogous to the action of the Congress in enacting a private bill and the action of the President or the Governor of a State in commuting a sentence or granting a pardon --

    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, that's -- I recall the case of Norwegian Nitrogen Company in Volume 288. 
    And there the -- as I recall it, this Court said what in substance the Congress did was to transfer a legislative process from itself to the President and the President was required to accept and receive the advice of the Tariff Commission, if you recall. 
    And the Tariff Commission was required to hold hearings on the question of rates, tariff rates. 
    And the question in that case was whether or not the Tariff Commission as a result of these hearings could take any consideration a lot of information which was never disclosed to complaining parties to the tariff. 
    And as a result of that, it would advice the President as to what action should be taken.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As against that, I put the La Abra case in which Congress could have settled the matter by legislation or through political channel or diplomatic channels but the perfect view is through the court channels.

    It's conceded that the Attorney General is not required to hold a hearing. 
    So, he has prescribed that on the issue of eligibility. 
    In other words, these minimum requirements that have to be met and bear in mind when I refer to those minimum requirements and I'll refer to this a little bit more fully in a moment, I mean that the Congress intended that this power was to be used sparingly. 
    On the question of eligibility, the Attorney General has prescribed a hearing.

    I'll be glad to do that, Mr. Justice Minton, if you'd like to.

    I -- I submit that you are required to log at all four corners of the regulations. 
    Now, the regulation providing for -- the use of confidential information in the decision making process of the Attorney General was promulgated in this instance at the same that the other regulations were submitted. 
    So, you're -- you're not within Accardi, you're outside of Accardi. 
    And -- and I -- I do not understand the logic of saying that where the Attorney General has to give no bread that a half a loaf is worse than nothing. 
    I can't understand that in -- in this type of clemency proceedings, after all what he has done has prescribed a hearing which is in aid of his decision and it seems to me that the alien fares no better, if anything, he fares worst if the Attorney General turns around tomorrow and abolishes the hearing, wipes it out completely and says that the suspension of deportation decision shall be based on submission of papers to the Attorney General and he'll make his decision accordingly. 
    I don't think that the alien is in a better position. 
    I think he's in the worst position because he has not given the right to present his side of the story.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Lindsay, do you think there's any distinction between the situation where the examiner is permitted to take into consideration this confidential information on the one hand and where perhaps the Attorney General, after he had reviewed all of the proceedings, might himself take -- take confidential information into consideration to determine whether he would overrule his board or not? 
    If -- if there's to be a hearing that is a fair hearing as -- as this sense, it must be a fair hearing, do you not think that the hearing officer should be required to give a hearing based upon evidence and then make his findings and report it through the -- through the Board of Appeals and eventually up to the Attorney General with -- with what discretionary power he may -- may have to act on. 
    Isn't it one thing for him to act and that when another thing for this man, who is presumably deciding a thing on a record, to take into consideration confidential information of a hearsay nature concerning which the -- the deportee knows absolutely nothing?

    No matter of what -- what proof he might make, the confidential information can just wipe it out and -- but he has no opportunity to -- to answer it.

    Congress -- Congress in the judgment of the Government thought that this power should be exercised only in the most unusual case.

    Well, that gets back to the point I made to the Chief Justice, which is I agree there is a limit on the exercise of this power.

    Mr. John V. Lindsay 
    Well, I don't -- I'd like to point out in answer to that question a situation which the Second Circuit was confronted with in -- in 1950 of a case called the Kaloudis case which is cited at page 20 of the Government's brief. 
    Now, there, you have not quite this situation on all force, we did in the Second Circuit a little bit later. 
    We've got the same situation as you got here and it's been -- and it's been settled in that Circuit. 
    But in the Kaloudis case this very question came up of how far can you go in probing the mind of the officer who's exercising this discretion? 
    There, the case was -- the alien had been sometime in the past a member of the International Workers Order. 
    Now, there have been no -- there is no -- there is no information as to whether he was a member with knowledge of any character that it may have had, that he was an actively engaged member whether he joined it for insurance purposes or why. 
    And the Second Circuit said this, "True without an inquiry we cannot know where the membership in the -- in the IWO was prejudicial for we cannot tell whether the Attorney -- the Attorney General had adequate grounds for proscribing it. 
    On the other hand, we cannot say that he did not and if the relator has any privilege of inquiring into the grounds he has been wronged and the rich should have gone." 
    This is habeas corpus proceedings. 
    An alien has no such privilege unless the ground stated is on its face insufficient, he must accept the decision for it was made in the exercise of discretion which we have again and again declared that we will not review, skipping a bit. 
    The power of the Attorney General to suspend deportation is a dispensing power. 
    Like a judge's power to suspend execution of sentence or the President's to pardon a convict. 
    It is a matter of grace over which the Court's have no review unless it affirmatively appears that denial has been actuated by considerations of Congress could not have intended to make relevant. 
    Now, a little bit later came the Matranga case which I shan't go into, decided by the Second Circuit in 1952 at which this very question was in point. 
    And the Second Circuit squarely held that this was in the nature of a discretionary decision, not going to the question of eligibility but on the question of whether or not suspension should be sustained, should be granted or not and that the Attorney General therefore may consider confidential information. 
    In this case, the regulation hadn't yet been promulgated. 
    It was prior to the 1952 Act and prior to the new regulations.

    May I answer your question this way, Your Honor, and I see my time is up so I'll make it brief. 
    In exclusion cases, Knauff and Mezei are two cases which deal with exclusion and they hold that confidential information there may be used without a hearing to exclude an alien. 
    Now, there -- there isn't any area of discretion in the Attorney General. 
    The alien has met all qualifications, his visa is open, he's in line, his health is okay, his papers are in order and yet because of confidential information, the Attorney General is, under the statute and upheld by this Court, is entitled to say, "We will not let him in without any hearing. 
    He cannot prove anything. 
    He can't even show that he's eligible under the Code and all the rest of it." 
    Now, in the instant case, the alien here is even in a worst position. 
    He is in an inferior status.

    But here Congress has given a status to a deportee to this extent, it has said that he can be allowed to prove three things and if -- if those are proven then he's eligible for the Attorney General to consider in his discretion --

    I just -- I just quoted you a case decided recently by the Court of Appeals where unusual hardship -- minimum requirement of unusual hardship and it was pretty tough if you read that case when you come to it in the Government's brief and the Attorney General still said, "I will not exercise discretion in favor of the alien in this case."

   Argument of Will Maslow
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4385.557" stopTime="4388.612">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Maslow.
speaker="will_maslow" startTime="4388.612" stopTime="4691.347">
    Mr. Will Maslow 
    I'd like to address myself, Your Honors, to two points. 
    First, the meaning of Section 235 (c) and second the claimed analogy between the power to suspend and the power to pardon. 
    Section 235 (c) relates to the exclusion of immigrants aliens. 
    That is the class which for all practical purposes has no rights under the Constitution. 
    This class here is not a deportee. 
    It's an alien who is deportable because under the statute suspension cannot be granted if a final order of deportation has been issued. 
    At the moment, therefore, when his application is considered, he's not a deportee, he's a person against whom a deportation proceeding is pending. 
    Now, when Congress authorized the use of confidential information and by the way this Court has not yet upheld that use and Knauff and Mezei cases dealt with the war time or emergency statute. 
    Section 235 (c) is the statute that has nothing at all to do with emergencies. 
    But assuming that 235 (c) is valid, Congress said, "You don't have to give him a hearing if you use confidential information," because it recognized that you can't have both concepts, a hearing and confidential information. 
    Mr. Lindsay has said that half a loaf is better than none. 
    I think that the half a loaf is poisoned, it is not better than none. 
    The alien who comes to the hearing, thinking that he is getting a right of some kind and as said walks into a snare, he's no better off and that there were no hearing at all. 
    As a matter of fact, he may be worst off. 
    Now, as to the analogy to pardon, the action of a president in refusing to issue a pardon is absolutely non-reviewable, no matter how arbitrary it is. 
    The acts of the President or those of an independent branch of the Government and this Court cannot review them. 
    But this Court can review and the Government has conceded that this Court can review a manifest abuse of discretion by an attorney general and there are cases where the lower courts have made this reversal. 
    I want to point out other distinctions in the pardoning power. 
    The pardoning power, unlike the power here, is not divided among the whole hierarchy with a special officer, Board of Immigration Appeals, the Attorney General and Congress, it's the act of a single man who in private, according to his own conscience, decides to act. 
    Secondly, there is a vast difference in the power to review the two. 
    Now, Mr. Lindsay was asked by several members of the Court as to where the judges -- where the Attorney General's discretion ends and the Government's brief concedes that where it appears in someway that there's been abuse of discretion, this Court can review them. 
    Now, it doesn't have to appear on the record if we can show by independent means that the Attorney General has been bribed or is corrupt or is actuated by racial or religious prejudice, the Court would still review it whether it appeared on the record or in his decision. 
    I'd like to emphasize as well that this Court in McGrath against Kristensen stated that the alien had a legal right to be considered for suspension. 
    That's the right that granted him by the regulations. 
    That's a far different situation from the criminal -- convicted criminal, who as of matter of grace, entreats the President to pardon him. 
    He has no rights at all. 
    This alien has a right to be considered. 
    And in the McGrath case, this Court reversed the Attorney General when he found that the alien was not eligible for it. 
    I'd like also to quote, because I think the language is apt, the paragraph from a decision in this Circuit -- in this District, the decision of Judge Morris involving the use of confidential information. 
    He said there is no place in this government for arbitrary actions and there is no way to know whether such action is arbitrary or not, unless the basis upon which it is taken is revealed. 
    If -- when Congress gave the Attorney General the power to act in his discretion, it didn't intend that he would have an absolute and limitless power. 
    The term discretion is a word that means implicit in it that the discretion will not be arbitrary. 
    Thank you.
