Gonzales v. Landon
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="11.075">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 111, Gonzales versus Landon. 
    Mr. Davis, you may proceed.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="11.075" stopTime="133.508">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    May it please the Court. 
    Before embarking on the discussion of the matter which was being considered when the Court rolled this yesterday, I'd like, if I may, to touch upon two preliminary matters. 
    The first is it relates to a question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked as to why the trial judge in his oral statement felt that he was troubled. 
    He said that he was troubled and he wished a review of one of these cases was sought in the Court of Appeals. 
    We agree with Mr. Wirin that the reason for the statement by the trial judge was that he was uncertain whether statements, admissions made in administrative hearings could be the basis for expatriation. 
    We think that was the reason why Judge Harrison suggested that -- that review be sought. 
    The second matter that I failed to mention yesterday and I think it bears upon Judge Harrison's evaluation and -- and characterization of the personality and the type of person petitioner was is that the trial judge pointed out that he had had another simiar case involving a person whom he thought to be a different kind of young man, and in that case, he felt that expatriation had not been proved. 
    He differentiated this case from that case and I bring it forth to indicate that it shows a degree of selectivity and a special consideration given to this particular case by Judge Harrison. 
    The rules of civil procedure on providing for a review and findings of fact provide that due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial judge to observe the witnesses. 
    And we believe that that is a factor which should be considered in this type of case as well as on others. 
    In the (Inaudible) denaturalization case, this Court, in upholding the denaturalization of (Inaudible) mentioned the fact that it paid due regard to the opportunity of the trial judge to weigh the credibility and characteristics of the witnesses.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="133.508" stopTime="142.287">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Suppose they don't decide the case of denaturalization involving the application in respect?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="142.287" stopTime="161.903">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    No, Mr. Justice, but we do not. 
    As I explained yesterday, we do not accept from the standard which was laid down in the Baumgartner and Schneiderman cases and which was accepted also in the (Inaudible) case. 
    We accept the standard laid down in those cases. 
    We believe that it was fulfilled in this case.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="161.903" stopTime="166.667">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Do you think that the trial judge accepted that standard?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="166.667" stopTime="206.311">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Burton, I think he did. 
    I think a reading of the closing statement at the end of the case plus his consideration of the -- consideration of the matter of the admission of the immigration testimony before in the case that he did. 
    At the close of -- of his opinion, he says that he doesn't believe the -- the petitioner. 
    He believes that the petitioner was more accurate and more nearly truth in his testimony before the immigration authorities. 
    And at the bottom of the page 33, he says, “I don't know how you can ask counsel. 
    You can ask me to find for the plaintiff here in view of his admissions and statements before the immigration officer.”

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes. 
    In that connection, I hope the Court will bear with me when I call the attention of the fact that there is pending case on the Ninth Circuit in which an amicus curiae brief has been filed. 
    This is the blue amicus curiae brief. 
    In that case, the plaintiff who was seeking a judgement of -- of citizenship has waived all factual issues. 
    He has stipulated that he left the country for the specific purpose of evading and avoiding the draft. 
    That case is now pending in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="392.931" stopTime="396.444">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It is clear from your point of view but they may be different on this side for that reason (Voice Overlap)
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="396.444" stopTime="483.615">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    That -- that is true but you asked me for -- for the advocate's point of view. 
    Coming now to the -- the question which was being discussed at the close of -- of the argument yesterday, I was asked whether if it were clear that petitioner remained in Mexico because his mother felt that, if he went to the United States, he would be drafted, and therefore, subject to injury and death during the war, whether that would be a fulfillment of the terms of -- of Section 401 (j) or whether that would be another type of purpose. 
    If I may put it in my own shorthand way, the question was whether his purpose in -- in that situation would not be his purpose to obey his mother or to abide by his mother's wishes rather than to evade the draft, and I was asked to comment on that. 
    Before discussing that, the legal issues involved, I would like to summarize, if I may, for the Court, what went on at the treated administrative hearings that did took place? 
    At the first administrative hearing, which is included on Exhibit A, there was hardly any mention of petitioner's mother. 
    The statements I think are pretty clear that he said he did not want to register because the war was on. 
    He did, in one statement, mention his mother but there are, if I may run through them very short, he said, "How did it happen that you were not registered for Selective Service before April 19, 1946?" 
    Because I did not --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="483.615" stopTime="485.240">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    What -- what page is that?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="485.240" stopTime="546.079">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    It's page -- it's not in the printed record, Mr. Justice. 
    It's in the exhibit here. 
    "Because I did not want to register." 
    “Then, why did you not register at the American Consulate in Chihuahua near your home?” 
    “Well, I will tell you again, I did not want to register.” 
    “Why did you not want to register for military service prior to 1946?” 
    “Because I was afraid to register.” 
    “Why were you afraid?” 
    “I was afraid in military service during the war.” 
    Then, he does say later, “I wanted to come to the United States in 1942 but my mother would not permit me to do so. 
    I would have come to the United States in 1944 or 1945 had it not been for the requirement to register.” 
    And then, later on, he says, “Why did you not come to the United States in 1944 or 1945 to work or to better your life?” 
    Answer - “It was on a kind of a war." 
    “Do you know that hostility ceased in August, 1945?” 
    Answer - “I knew that the fighting had ceased in 1945, but I did know the date." 
    Now, that's the first hearing in October, 1947.

speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="563.218" stopTime="603.118">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    The only mentioned, the mother in the first hearing. 
    In the second hearing, there was considerably more mention of the mother, and -- and she does -- does have a permanent role at three years later on October 1950. 
    But it is always and I would like to stress this to the Court. 
    In relation to the mother as well as to himself, it's always the fear of the draft and the fear of the war. 
    There is not a suggestion that his mother wanted him to stay in Mexico in order to support her or her -- or for family reasons. 
    It is because his mother feared that if he went to the United States, he would be drafted. 
    So -- so, his mother does play a prominent role in the -- in the second hearing. 
    It's always in that connection. 
    Now, at the third hearing --

    Assuming -- assuming that he knuckled under the Court -- of the power to decide by his mother, the mother's motif in exercising such instrument is immaterial to the question that -- that the inference was exerted upon.

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Well, that is right, and now that's what I'm going to deal with when I come to discuss the legal issues. 
    If I can conclude with the summary of the hearings, at the third hearing, he again emphasized the mother, but he admitted that he had not so emphasize the mother previously. 
    He said, “Now, I wish to say that my position is that my mother. 
    I was afraid that I would be drafted. 
    I was not afraid.”

    What -- what did happen is that at the second and third hearings, they were read to him what happened at the preceding hearings in Spanish, and he was asked to make any corrections or to agree and he said, “Yes, I made those statements. 
    I -- there's no use in denying them. 
    Now I'm with the view that my mother, that the real reason was that my mother was afraid.” 
    But to answer your question more precisely, at the administrative hearings, the second and third hearings, at the second hearing, the first hearing was read to him in Spanish. 
    At the third hearing, the second and first were read to him in Spanish. 
    Now, what occurred at the trial of the case, I am not absolutely certain. 
    The hearings were available in English. 
    In the trial of the case, of course, for several years later and he had become -- I don't know whether he was literate in -- in English or what, but he had certainly would become -- been able to speak it.

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Well, there are two facets to it, Mr. Justice Clark.

    A general rule against that we think would be harmful. 
    The -- the second problem is whether viewing what there is in this administrative exhibit plus what there is in the record. 
    If the Court is not convinced that the standard was met giving due regard to the power of the trial judge to observe the individual and so forth, then of course, we have not met our burden, and -- and that is a matter relating to this individual case which I would not want to press too hard.

    The Court -- the Court -- well, there have been many administrative cases, cases that have been before this Board of special inquiry and appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals which have not directly come to the Court. 
    And in those cases, I would say that the basic evidence is an admission by the -- by the individual himself. 
    There's hardly any other evidence that you could obtain in a case of this kind. 
    The man is outside the country and as the Court said -- and the issue involves his intent. 
    And as the Court said last year in the case involving the sincerity of the conscientious objector, it would be naïve to expect that he would make a public admission of his intent to evade or to deceive prior to -- to the institution of proceedings.

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    I'm not even sure of that, Mr. Justice -- Justice Douglas. 
    The report of the committee which formed the -- which formed the study of the McCarran Act said that in 1948, they had a statistical table for the year 1948 for all reasons for expatriation. 
    And there are 135, they said in the year 1948. 
    Now, many of those were cases which have been administratively determined and were never appealed, I mean, never brought to Court. 
    Some of them were administratively determined by the immigration service and they never even appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    If the Court is interested on this, there is an Article in 1948 in -- in Volume 5 of the monthly review of the immigration and naturalization service by a man named Sharon, S-H-A-R-O-N.

    When he sought to return to the country in October 1950, it was then that he was questioned at the boarder, for the reasons for his remaining in Mexico during the war years and he is not registering with the consul in -- in Chihuahua and so forth. 
    And it was then that he made the statements which I read initially to the Court this morning. 
    And so, on that basis that it was determined by the immigration authorities at that time that he had lost his citizenship, and therefore, he was excludable.

    In October 1950, he sought entry again and was excluded again in October 1950. 
    Then, in May 1951, he crossed the boarder claiming to be American Citizen and he was -- he -- he entered the boarder.

    And on his return on January 1952, he was again stopped. 
    And they had the record of the preceding hearings and he had another hearing in January 1952 and he was excluded then. 
    So, he went back to Mexico, but in May of -- of 1952, he again entered as a citizen, claiming to be a citizen and that he wasn't stopped.

    Those all come -- come into being by virtue of the administrative determination ill-advised the state department or by the immigration service, that person has become expatriated and then he seeks a court review on the basis and there is a de novo court review and that is true here.

    Well, the difference is this. 
    That as we were discussing yesterday, if he is a native born citizen, and he comes to this country and files a declaratory Judgment Act and he proves he is native-born, then as I said, the burden shifts to the Government to prove that he committed an act of expatriation. 
    We would argue that if he did commit the act of expatriation and he then defends on the ground that he did it under duress as his claim here on the parental duress that the burden shifts back to him to prove that he did it until parental duress.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    May it please the Court. 
    First, to an answer a question asked by the Chief Justice and by other Justices as to whether there are other similar cases. 
    I can just say this. 
    There are about a dozen similar cases now pending in the District Court at Los Angeles, and when Judge Harrison was talking about the problem, he was referring to the problem which he and the other judges of that Court will face by about these dozen cases. 
    There are --

    Yes, meaning, persons who have remained in Mexico during the war and with the respect to whom the immigration service was claiming that they have lost their citizenship under Section 401 (j). 
    Now, one other matter with respect to a question put by Mr. Justice Harlan to Mr. Davis. 
    I think Mr. Davis gave the impression to this Court. 
    I'm sure he didn't intend it. 
    That the first time that this petitioner deny the admissions -- denied that he made admissions was at the court trial. 
    The fact of the matter is that before the immigration service in 1952, before he had a lawyer, before he had a trial, before the immigration service, he said to the immigration service when confronted with the translation of his former statements that he had not made them and that he -- that the -- that the immigration officers had confused him and that it was not voluntary. 
    Now, the word “voluntary” appears of course in the English translation since they were -- since they were -- this translation was by immigration inspectors. 
    But in any event, a rejection of his admissions, a claim that the admissions were not made and at the transcript of the statements were not correct, was made by him before the immigration service.

    He denied and he made them. 
    He said in some respect that it is incorrect and he said it wasn't (Inaudible) 
    He said the record shows that he said it wasn't voluntary. 
    Again, I say that wasn't his word. 
    We don't know what word he used in Spanish. 
    That is the word which appears -- which was interpreted by the -- by the immigration inspector interpreter as to what he said about it. 
    The Chief Justice asked two questions that I think should be answered. 
    One question was, to Mr. Davis, and my answer is different from the one given by Mr. Davis, whether the statute had -- was penal in its purpose. 
    I think the answer may be found in that Senator Russell, who introduced a Bill in the Senate said that this statute was penal in its purpose and that appeals on page 7 of our brief.

    That -- that doesn't help me very much on the constitutional question whether denaturalization was leading to a subject to the provision of the Bill of Rights in reference to promote prosecution.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Now, that the Chief Justice asked another question which I'd like to answer him is this, whether the 1865 statute which dealt with disease was the statute which provided for the loss of the United States Citizenship. 
    There was some suggestion by Mr. Davis that that was the -- either the effect of or was the language of that statute. 
    That statute, Your Honors, will find in the Government's brief, the text of it, at page 58. 
    It provides that the rights of citizenship shall be deemed forfeit rather than a provision as broad and as soothing as what is involved here, namely, that citizenship per se is lost. 
    It -- as a matter of fact, the statute is in the footnote of page 58 provides that the right to hold office shall be lost. 
    In other words, that statute was intended to apply to the laws of some of the important attributes of citizenship rather than citizenship itself. 
    And finally, what I am urging to point, Your Honors, with respect to the record in this case and the nature of proof proffered by the Government for the Government concede the burden of proof was upon it is that when properly and fairly upraised. 
    This evidence is not sufficient to change the color of legal litmus paper and to permit the forfeiture of rights of citizenship. 
    The phrase changed color of legal litmus papers of course not mine. 
    It is that of Mr. Justice Holmes but it replied here.
