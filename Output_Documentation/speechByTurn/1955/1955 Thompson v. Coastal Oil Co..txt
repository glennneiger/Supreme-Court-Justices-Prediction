    Number 1, on the calendar, William Thompson versus Coastal Oil Company. 
    Mr. Axtell.
speaker="silas_blake_axtell" startTime="24.036" stopTime="906.442">
    Mr. Silas Blake Axtell 
    The Court please. 
    Nearly 40 years ago when I first appeared in this Court for a sailor. 
    I've been working for seaman for eight years before that exclusively and have continued. 
    This case is one, very difficult to discuss and I'm going to refrain. 
    I'm going into details as to what caused the injury to the plaintiff. 
    The plaintiff was born in Georgia, 1892. 
    Speaking of his education, he said that if I must answer that question, I have to tell you that the facilities for colored people in Georgia when I was a boy were very inadequate. 
    But learning, I had since I gotten on the ships and running around. 
    The man, William Thompson was a tall, very strong person of normal outlook upon life, and a competent cook, have been a chief cook and assistant chief cook. 
    He signed out not ago on this ship and Marron, Rosina Marron they called her of the Coastal Oil Company. 
    On December 1st, 1949, he was injured on the 12th of January, some 52 days after he had joined the ship. 
    If Your Honors would examine, the appellee's record and brief in the original court at -- you'll turn to page 42, 43, 45, and, particularly, 47 you will see a corroboration by the chief steward of the vessel of the very, very serious charges made by Thompson to the delegates of the ship. 
    When I began for seaman, we didn't have unions to the extent they have them now, we had a union but it was a poor thing so that it's a chief attorney and its chief president or officer and (Inaudible) came to me, the boy in charge of the seaman, the branch of the legal aid society for a legal advice because it didn't cost anything but he made the slave of me while he made free men of the sailors. 
    The man, Thompson, revolted that what he had seen. 
    He went down the alley way to get some men to play poker. 
    He had a -- he love playing poker. 
    He opened the door, what he saw was so terrible especially as there was an extra man in the room with the three offenders. 
    He reported it to chief steward immediately. 
    Schiffers whose testimony we took. 
    We took his testimony after he had been examined by the defendants in the case. 
    They didn't know what his testimony. 
    They didn't even want his statement, as that appears in the record. 
    Schiffers did nothing. 
    He did nothing when he saw what he had seen two months before this --disaster. 
    The master knew it, the chief mate knew it, they all knew it. 
    They tolerated it, a condition that's intolerable. 
    As a father of six sons, I think, it's a matter of public interest for all of us, ashore or on the sea. 
    Such people should be controlled or eliminated from contact with others. 
    They had delegates, one for the deck department, one for the engine room department, one for the steward department. 
    We took the testimony of Kaplus. 
    His testimony appears also in this appellee's additional record. 
    Kaplus verified but the plaintiff had said he was present at the hearing of the three delegates, the next evening, the night of January 13th, the night of the attempted murder. 
    This horrible thing allowed to walk of three amongst men, born in Cuba didn't want to leave the ship. 
    He'd worked into four or five months. 
    He like the job and his associates or referred as in another name, I won't mention. 
    At the meeting, Young, the chief pumpman and the ship's chairman as they call it, said, "What do you got, Thompson? 
    You have no witness to corroborate you. 
    You're all alone. 
    What can you do?" 
    He said, "Well, I demand that these men leave the ship." 
    They could have called it the attention of a coast guard. 
    I don't suppose they knew about the United States Attorney's Office. 
    But it was a union affair and they were going to quash it. 
    Get rid of the men in his own way. 
    This one man, a Negro from Georgia, born in 1892 with characteristics that you and I should emulate. 
    He alone challenged these three horrible things together with the man who was a witness to it in that room, alone. 
    And he said, "What can we do? 
    Where's your evidence? 
    Where is your corroboration?" 
    They didn't call the chief steward to say what he saw two months earlier and everybody else saw in that ship. 
    What did the murderer do? 
    He was heard by Kaplus, I referred to it in our brief, to have said, "I'll kill that." 
    As of the -- he went and got the key from the chief cook and went into the galley and got a cleaver of the weight of this but more the size of this one, in the left, both of which were in evidence at the trial. 
    He waited in an alleyway in a dark place and when Thompson came by alone. 
    He stood behind him and we was not a small man and came down on Thompson, hit like that, twice, third time. 
    Braising only the scalp but the two blows penetrated both tables of his skull. 
    The man fell, moaning to the deck, I'm -- I'm dead -- I'm dead. 
    His instinct then lapsing consciousness permitted that. 
    Had he not had that native wit, that fiend will chop him from the top of his face and head until he was dead. 
    Why? 
    They say $4000 was a reasonable compensation for that. 
    I would say that if there was no injury to endure such an experience with a life of serving in the ships ahead. 
    Man, you even work for 45 years already. 
    He had a few years left, to see a meat cleaver daily in his work is sufficient cause for the neurosis from which he suffered. 
    Now, getting down to the law of this thing. 
    The Circuit Court reversed.We asked for re-argument immediately or in that Court, to grant it. 
    Judge Biggs of Delaware, Judge McLaughlin of New Jersey dissented and their findings were strictly in accordance with the principles of law as established by this great Court in Garrett against Moore-McCormack. 
    The other five judges, Hastie, Staley, Maris, well in any rate, they're all from Pennsylvania. 
    I'm certainly I do not imply that this is a conspiracy from Pennsylvania to reinstate what you disallowed and overruled in the Garrett case. 
    The Garrett case was a Pennsylvania case. 
    If you have time to look at the decision, you then reversed. 
    You will find there the statement that in this State, there has never been a Court of Chancery. 
    Our equity is administered by our courts at common law. 
    And you will find that there is ingrained in that procedure, the proposition that the burden of proving the release, rests, proving there to us that the relief should be set aside rest upon the man's seeking to set is aside. 
    In our federal court, the rule is the opposite. 
    The burden is upon the man who defends release in this case for $4000. 
    The plaintiff in this case was a member and a (Inaudible) Union for whom I was counsel for all my life, until it went out of their business under the drive of the Communist horde. 
    He was one of those men that union men called "company men". 
    Read if you have time, the letters that he wrote to the company, beginning. 
    Telling about how he was annoyed by lawyers who wanted to give him advice. 
    He pushed him away. 
    I think they shouldn't have been there. 
    But what are we going to do? 
    The law schools are pouring him out with thousands. 
    What are they going to do? 
    Do we have to revert to Marxian compensation? 
    Marxian compensation to avoid this thing, I hope not. 
    He was a company man. 
    He sought to ingratiate himself in the minds of his employer, Mr. Mahoney. 
    He told them how bad he felt but he's going to get well and he was going to go back to save his job on the Rosina Marron. 
    And when he transferred from one hospital to another, three of them in the south, I believe, finally appearing in the District Court for the trial of the culprit. 
    The first trial was a mistrial and second trial resulted in a plea of guilty. 
    The coast guard had gotten rid of him, gone back to his native, Cuba. 
    At any rate, the man is a nervous wreck, his work is true but he has told us of his suffering. 
    I personally prepared this case for trial. 
    I was present when it was tried except for the time when Barron, the conjecture was questioned and said that he had told Mr. Thompson about Dr.Farr's report that he had only a 10% permanent disability.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Axtell, what would you say is the legal difference of the position between yourself and your opponent?
speaker="silas_blake_axtell" startTime="915.032" stopTime="1146.548">
    Mr. Silas Blake Axtell 
    Well, the difference is that the plaintiff was under impression that he was well. 
    There is an article here in the Saturday post last week on Schizophrenics that is in enlightening. 
    These -- these men, they get to be very up buoyant, optimistic, then they go down. 
    This man borrowed $50 from men in the hospital in New York. 
    He got $100 more and then went to their office and got $300 to go to Arkansas to get hot baths, so he feels better. 
    He came back feeling fine, was sent to Dr.Farr for the second time -- no, the first time. 
    And they came back optimistic. 
    The hospital record said he was practically cured and nothing wrong with him. 
    The hospital record shows encephalopathy of the brain by trauma.He thought he was cured and he had lost about $2000 in maintenance and wages. 
    They were giving him $2000 extra. 
    He would go into work. 
    But when he returned to work and he had to use this meat axe and the heat of the galley, he found hot flashes on his head. 
    He imagined it in a place where he was injured. 
    Completely nervous, unable to stay at any job more than a little while, rushing on -- I never forget the time when he would -- in my office waiting for the trial if he could get it over. 
    We pressed for trial. 
    They opposed. 
    Finally, on condition we waive a jury. 
    They said they've tried the case. 
    They had one of these offenders, his deposition in Court. 
    He denied everything of course. 
    The injury is very serious. 
    We felt as lawyers if the Court gave him in $20,000 not more than half what he might have but that figure was one the plaintiff had fixed for himself in his negotiation to these underwriters. 
    And they have said, "But you're all right now." 
    As you read the Waters case we've cited in our brief and the (Inaudible) case, you will find -- excuse me. 
    The Ninth Circuit in the Waters case. 
    The chief engineer settled his case for $1000, the United States Government, and tuberculosis. 
    He had complained of unseaworthy conditions and that the crew were incompetent. 
    And he as chief engineer had to spend so much time rushing in and out of the engine room long hours, with no opportunity to rest, that he developed the tuberculosis. 
    That man presumably intelligent, fairly well-educated, settled his case for a $1000. 
    The District Court sustained the release. 
    The Circuit Court, the very learned opinion by Judge Bone reversed the District Court. 
    I want to -- you bear with me, how much time I got here? 
    I -- I'm unaware of the time could -- five minutes more?

speaker="silas_blake_axtell" startTime="1147.347" stopTime="1481.891">
    Mr. Silas Blake Axtell 
    Yes, thank you. 
    This thing really began, these releases, we called them red, white and blue releases. 
    It takes so long to fill them out. 
    They haven't been going along that to Vernon Jones who got his early training in my office way back in 19 -- had got acquainted with the sailors. 
    (Inaudible) office that they got the people took him over. 
    And he designed this release which the man has to write out and go back and repeat something he's five or six lines or questions about. 
    To prove beyond any doubt, he knows what he's getting. 
    To release -- he is releasing all that he knows about and all that he hasn't known about that doctors make mistakes and everybody makes mistakes. 
    But regardless of that, he's signing off his rights entirely. 
    Now, I've been to sea myself enough to know that the change in economic condition of the seaman which has been suggested here as a reason for this sustaining the Circuit Court is not a reason. 
    A man doesn't change his thinking or attitude toward the land and its people because he gets more money for the risk of his life and the denial of happiness that follows the sea life. 
    It doesn't change a bit. 
    I remember on 1919, ordinary seaman on the West (Inaudible) when we came to the Panama Canal and we've been aboard that ship for several weeks. 
    I couldn't get ashore quick enough.Came back to the vessel and a bunch of bananas on my shoulder, I've gone back to the second one because somebody had stolen the first one. 
    Walked down some planks and jumped on to the deck. 
    That is no proof of incompetence, I hope, but I do say that a sailor, to get his money will say "I believe you" and he -- he does believe him and he signs and he signed anything. 
    So, the mere language of the release should be disregarded. 
    The first case was a case of (Inaudible), boy from that island in the Mediterranean -- what is it? 
    The one the British are holding down there. 
    He had hurt his shoulder in the icebox of a Standard Oil tanker. 
    He'd signed a release for $87.50, maintenance and cure. 
    The case came in before Judge Conger who hadn't been on the bench long. 
    I decided to withdraw the indemnity allegation because I have felt that to prove that there was negligence under the Jones Act, just because ice accumulated on the deck of a refrigerator wasn't a very strong case. 
    But the evidence showed that the versa which had been calcified and shown so by the x-ray had cleared up under treatment. 
    And he went back to work after signing the release and then he found he had to go back to the hospital, the calcification had returned to the shoulder. 
    The hospital and the company doctor made a mistake. 
    The judge, he gave him in those days that wasn't much as 1938, $228 in maintenance to make up for the additional time that he was laid out. 
    The Court here has in our briefs, about five of them, all the law there is on this subject. 
    All we ask is this that you give careful consideration to the original case that I submitted to Judge Conger, Harden against Gordon 4027, federal cases 1823, read the Minerva of the House of Lords in England mentioned in our brief in the Circuit Court on appellee's addition to the record. 
    1825, you find them. 
    I don't see any evidence they knew about Judge Story's decision in 1823. 
    But the similarity is there and it -- it should be observed today. 
    Most unfortunate would it be to take a man like this who's already suffering from a neurosis and aggravation. 
    And add to it, the frustration of defeat after this long battle.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. Axtell, what do you consider the legal ground to be on which this release should be set aside?
speaker="silas_blake_axtell" startTime="1488.967" stopTime="1774.218">
    Mr. Silas Blake Axtell 
    Well, on the ground that there was a mistake as to the extent of injury. 
    The man approached the thing, he was optimistic, he wanted to be -- he wanted the end of thing. 
    He wanted his money. 
    There wasn't any fraud. 
    There wasn't any duress. 
    But there was a mistake and the mistake was inherent in an injury he had sustained. 
    You read the testimony of Dr.Samberg in the record. 
    Now, we call Dr. Samberg specialist, one of the leading men in America who happened to be the consultant at the Marine Hospital where this man was a patient. 
    They called Dr. Farr, the Yale Medical School who is a surgeon. 
    I've known Dr. Farr for ever since I began the practice of law, classmate of theory of the Burlingame firm, great picture on Yale, 1903. 
    Well, he is a kindly man. 
    He says that 10% total disability, the judge in the record says "Well, if this man isn't hurt worse than 10%, I'm no judge." 
    Read the list of statutes where I point to where Judge Hartshorne questions the plaintiff, questions down, the man who took the release. 
    Questions Dr. Farr and questions Dr. Samberg. 
    He took the trial away from counsel. 
    They didn't call Mr. Thompson back to rebut the statement that he'd been told about the 10% because I was in an Naturalization Court hearing an eloquent address to new citizens when I couldn't be. 
    Mr. Gleason, the lawyer who were trying it was alone. 
    However, take the judge's conclusion and then I ask you this. 
    The McAllister case by Judge Minton, you recall the question. 
    How did he get the polio? 
    Was it from the open latrine on the deck where the Chinese longshoremen were brought or permitted or was it from a visit ashore? 
    Who could tell? 
    Science had no answer. 
    The judge decided who was he? 
    It was Judge Hincks who'd been on the bench 40 years or more conscientious fine man. 
    He decided the facts. 
    Does your -- do Your Honors, want a succession of appeals like this or do you consider if expedient and proper in this time to follow the doctrine of the McAllister case which has been followed in all the Circuits practically to get rid of these disputed questions of fact. 
    This trial is de novo, were invented, I presume by expediency like when the early cases I tried in Philadelphia where I had a mistrial because I mentioned to the jury the amount we're going to sue for or asking for, a rule peculiar to Philadelphia. 
    That had a reason -- I presume in a similar railroad case where there was no other way to reverse the plaintiff. 
    Now, you then have the situation. 
    Allow the federal judge to be the guardian of the Court and the law says he is. 
    Let him have it. 
    Let the man appeal to him. 
    If he decides against the man that ends it, should end it. 
    If he decides the other way, it probably will end it to. 
    Let him have that but why should the Circuit Court intervene and bring in ancient myths from Pennsylvania about equity and the burden of proof especially when they're in direct conflict with the stated policy of this Court. 
    Garrett against Moore-McCormack is the law. 
    It has been correctly applied by Judge Hartshorne and it had been misapplied by this Circuit Court, the Third Circuit. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Michael E. Hanrahan

    Mr. Hanrahan.
speaker="michael_e_hanrahan" startTime="1775.825" stopTime="1978.141">
    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    If the Court please. 
    I realized that my task is to sustain this release and to urge the Court to render an opinion on this reargument. 
    Reiterating Justice Black's holding in the Garrett case so that the maritime industry as a whole has -- who are looking at this case most eagerly had something to determine just where they stand. 
    I might say that if a release entered into one of the circumstances that Thompson -- surrendering Thompson release, it set aside here that the whole amicable adjustment, 90% of the seaman's claims today, I'm talking about today and a few years ago of being settled out of Court that are quick release so the man doesn't have to wait four or five years for this case to come up and pay attorney's fees and doctor's fees and so forth. 
    Before -- before going into a brief summary of the facts, I think, it's just important to -- for the -- my further argument to really reiterate the three-fold holding of the Garrett case, one then, I admit representing the steamship company. 
    I have the burden of proof which I contend was sustained when the Circuit Court reversed the District Court's holding. 
    It's clearly erroneous under the facts. 
    The second element of the Garrett decision was that we must prove that the seaman signed the release with a full understanding of his rights. 
    And the third, and this is most important, I think, in consideration with Your Honor's question, the mistake. 
    “The adequacy of the consideration and the nature of the legal and medical advise available at the time the release was signed are ought to be considered.” 
    Just by hitting highlights, I think, it's important just to point out to the Court that a lot seaman has changed so considerably over the years.I mean, the days of Captain Bligh, Moby Dick and the whipping post of gun. 
    Things have changed considerably since Mr. Axtell has -- have been representing seaman. 
    I saw that he had a quote that he published and his one published by the attorney for the National Maritime Union. 
    This is a summary for the seaman of -- of what the law is. 
    This is given to the seaman. 
    There is no question here for instance that Thompson himself had executed releases before. 
    He's let us knew -- summarized in the appendix that he -- I think he wrote about eight of them to the company and telling them how he felt. 
    He knew we had these headaches. 
    He knew he had a triple fracture of the skull. 
    He had a -- or I think, the record indicates close to a dozen office of legal advice to -- to represent him, but he chose to go ahead on his own.

    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    The case was decided in 1950 before the Second Circuit's opinion in the Keen case and this Court's opinion on the Boudin case. 
    The Third Circuit when -- have reviewed this case said that the Keen and Boudin cases could not have ex post fact -- facto effect. 
    My argument or just to review what those cases held there -- they held that notice was not a requirement of an assailant's vicious propensities as long as he in fact did have these vicious propensities or peristaltic or homicidal maniac, I think, was the one involved in the Keen case. 
    But again, I say if -- if even this law is considered to have ex post facto effect, Thompson was settling a case of questionable liability. 
    This was a civil case. 
    They could have had a jury here. 
    There was no telling what the jury would have done. 
    Now, we -- we'll admit all through here that this man, Medina who did the assaulting was a feminine. 
    I mean, he had feminine tendencies. 
    The alleged homosexual act that preceded the assault is highly disputed. 
    It's disputed all through the record.

    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    Well, I -- I'm really not prepared to answer that but thinking, as I stand here before you, it's -- it's a disgusting thing to normal people, but whether something that would actually affect the seaworthiness of a ship. 
    I mean the laws, gone into homicidal maniac. 
    I -- I don't think -- the ship would actually be unseaworthy if it had such a -- a man on board. 
    I mean that the seamen are known for their -- their wild endeavors ashore. 
    That doesn't affect the efficient running of a ship. 
    I don't -- I don't think that even if there was a proven -- and the captain had noticed of a homosexualist that affect the ship seaworthiness, to do what it's supposed to do. 
    But again, I'm -- I'm here principally to -- to sustain a release for $4000. 
    Now, $4000 is not one of these old releases where a fellow would lose a finger or something and the company would give him $15. 
    Such considerations would shot the conscience of the Court. 
    But as I say, at the time Thompson signed this release, he had the choice of determining whether or not he would proceed to trial before a jury whether it was perceived in admiralty before a judge. 
    He was equipped with the -- a discharge from the Marine Hospital itself. 
    I -- I would like to get back, Your Honor, to rule out any question of mistake of medical diagnosis here because that -- that is not in this case. 
    When he was discharged months before his signed to release --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But so far as I'm concerned, you don't have to take how many times on that. 
    I agree with you on that point. 
    I'd like to put this specific question or because -- perhaps, I haven't made myself clear. 
    The rule of law as it was understood at the time this release was made was that the unseaworthiness doctrine did not apply to this sort of a situation. 
    Is that right? 
    That was before the Second Circuit's decision in the Keen case --

    Right.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And therefore, the representation, however, innocent he was assuming that (Voice Overlap) was to the effect that this man had a difficult case because he would have to prove under the Jones Act the seaworthiness doctrine not being applicable, that the shipowner knew that this man was a homosexual, is that right?

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Now, what about a rule of law in this seaman's cases or let me ask you one preliminary question. 
    Does the shipowner knew that this man did not have a lawyer, is that right?

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What would you say to a rule of law in the seaman's cases that if a shipowner knowing that a seaman has not got a lawyer makes a representation as to the law that he does so with his own risk?

    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    Such as a -- a proposition taken hypothetically like that it is -- is difficult to answer. 
    I -- I think we have to consider the specific representation. 
    If the company represented have said to him that your chances is one out of a hundred above the collecting on -- on this that the law is stuck against you and it was -- it was really strong there. 
    I -- I think that that would be one thing, but I -- I think if a -- it's a consideration where they talked about the pros and cons and as here, Thompson started a figure of 1500 and this was talked about and it considered the length of time. 
    He have to wait after a trial and possibilities of -- of winning the case because even though the law might have been a mistake it would be before a jury who would --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2515.988" stopTime="2529.560">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    No, but the law -- the question of whether the seaworthiness rule applied if you were representing this seaman would have a great bearing as to the strength of his case, wouldn't it?
speaker="michael_e_hanrahan" startTime="2529.560" stopTime="2535.355">
    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Exactly. 
    And therefore -- oh, therefore, I suggest that when the steamship company knows that it is dealing with a man who is not represented by a lawyer. 
    Is it an unattainable proposition of law to say that in this seaman's cases, if he chooses to make a representation as to the law however innocent, however good faith, he has to stand at all on the risk, take the risk?

    I mean, with the -- with the way the seaman's slot has been approved, besides attorney's actually retained by the unions. 
    They have counselors on the staff but frequently the -- while the seaman's in the hospital, negotiations will be done by a representative of -- of -- you know -- actually works in the office of the S.I.U. or the N.M.U. 
    We handle sort of the whole thing for them. 
    Now, to expect even on the seaman's case with the facilities they have available today to expect the adjustor for the company who was a layman himself to give him an adequate brief on the law before he signs the releases that -- that it's going pretty far.

    Well, all he has to do is not to say anything on the law. 
    I'm assuming that this release had this representative of yours, Mr. Barron said nothing about the law would have been a perfectly valid release because I agree with you myself that the question of each of the mistake on the medical evidence is --

    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    -- we get back to this too. 
    Even if it -- on the stand, the length of disability, he was on about January 1930 to about July of 1950, some six odd months. 
    Now, for those months he spent in the various marine hospitals at no cost to himself. 
    So, if there was no liability, get his maintenance and cure. 
    In other words, for the two months, he was out-patient received a few hundred dollars. 
    I mean that's what have been entitled. 
    This was a liability case. 
    So, after his discussion with them, he's given $3700 more which is the whole spirit of negotiating settlement of this sort. 
    I mean, what the seaman and what the (Inaudible) do, would they make not only a joint approximation of future disability or just how badly hurt the fellow is. 
    But the -- the possibilities of winning the case, I don't think there is a lawyer in this Court room that hasn't experienced the situation where he was 99% sure he is going to win a case and just something that he couldn't -- can't explain today, laws I mean.

    Well, don't you think you are taking into consideration also, Mr. Hanrahan, the -- the nature of the injury that the man has?

    Don't you think that they ought to be a lot more consider -- a lot more careful when they're dealing with a man who has had a severe blow on the head that went through his skull and they gave him a mental condition than they would if he happened to have lost a finger and they were negotiating?
speaker="michael_e_hanrahan" startTime="2880.539" stopTime="3041.108">
    Mr. Michael E. Hanrahan 
    I do and that -- that's a question that I wanted to answer before, that there has been a or a lot of vagueness in resulting to hypothesis when talking about the medical aspects of this case and the mistakes in prognosis, because when he got out of the Marine Hospital before signing the release. 
    He was given a slip by the Marine Hospital and what could be more independent than our own United States Public Health Service. 
    That he had this fractured skull and encephalopathy which is a brain damage due to trauma. 
    But they said he'd be able to go back to work in a month. 
    Nobody denies that he had fractured skull that he knew it and he was dealt with accordingly. 
    And as a matter of fact, they adjusted and then send him to a company doctor who predicted a longer disability than the Marine Hospital that is three months. 
    And a permanent disability which the Marine Hospital -- and which the man was informed, getting back to representations, he is told this by the adjustor. 
    And then the man goes back to work and this all talks in petitioners briefs that he wasn't able to sell that it's high ratings as he could before, but that's contradicted in the record because I've put in the records in the grace line and the Moore-McCormack line showing that he could work or two years later as chief cook, which was two degrees higher than he had worked in that other considerably higher wage per month. 
    In the time that elapsed from the date of the assault and was discharged from the hospital to the Marine Hospital, he did go back to the Marine Hospital on four occasions but they weren't for this head condition. 
    They were urethritis, kidney trouble, ulcers and a penile sore coming that fall in the appendix abstracts from these various marine hospitals with the exception, that a week before the trial, his attorney sent him over to the Marine Hospital and he took two out-patient treatments there. 
    And that -- that's all I know, just asked for treatments. 
    And there, the diagnosis which is also in the record says, "No evidence of fracture or intracranial pressure." 
    Those were the abstracts of the last visit proceeding the trial.

    And Barron refused to consider any greater settlement figure than $4000 because he insisted to Thompson that Thompson was practically well then. 
    Barron admits that if he hadn't then known that Dr.Farr's prognosis was incorrect and that Thompson's future would be serious, as it has now turned out to be. 
    He would not have evaluated his case at $4000, but would have told Thompson to get a lawyer before he settle.

    What you -- what you have isn't it, a finding of fact by the district judge that this man did make his statement, which was not true, but which he thought was true and that that induced this man without his lawyer to sign the release. 
    And the Court of Appeals said, held that even though without offsetting that time that even though this statement was made and was not correct. 
    It was an honest misstatement and that as a matter of law, the release wouldn't be set aside while making an honest mistake of the fact, even though it abused the man to settle his case with an adequate sum.
