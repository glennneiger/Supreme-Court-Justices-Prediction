    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 231, Bill Hatahley et al, versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Marquis.
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="18.078" stopTime="454.439">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    May it please the Court. 
    Our position is two-fold. 
    First, we think the actions taken here were appropriate in enforcement of law regulating the grazing area of the public domain. 
    Second, we think that assuming that that is not so, assuming some defect is found in the procedures or a mistake as to the law applicable that that cannot be the basis of a judgment in the Tort Claims Act. 
    I don't think I need separately deal with the matter of the injunction. 
    I think so far as necessary, that will come out in the course of my discussion. 
    I think that the matter of damages is dealt with adequately in the briefs and I don't think that is necessary to be dealt upon during my argument. 
    First of all, and I think as the Court of Appeals held, we were plainly right, A, in applying the Utah abandoned horse law to the Taylor Grazing Act area and, B, in the procedures and so forth that were taken under that Act. 
    And I will have to leave to the briefs on the record the dealing with the details of that for the most part. 
    Now first, and this is the matter which is quite important in the administration of the Taylor Grazing Act. 
    It is the question, “Did the Taylor Grazing Act supersede the state law and in particular in this case, the state law as to abandoned horses?” 
    A three-minute summary of the situation when the Taylor Grazing Act was passed. 
    I don't think we need be reminded the importance of the public domain in the west to the livestock and cattle and sheep industries. 
    In the State of Utah, for example, 70% of the land is still public domain. 
    And that 70% -- the 30% that is privately or state owned is interspersed sections like school lands, 16s and 36s or the homesteads or small areas and the public domain runs through the entire area and it's a checkerboard. 
    For the most part, in this grazing area, the springs, the wells, the pass, the lowland where there's some cultivation, will be under a patent and the attached grazing area of wide scope will be public domain subject to grazing licenses. 
    Because of the very great importance of the grazing matter to the west, special laws had been built up special rules of law modifying the common law as to trespass and as to such matters in order to deal with the situation of an unfenced area of public domain of large importance to the local industry. 
    And of course, that is the source and has been the cause of dispute between cattle men and sheep men and had related in particular laws. 
    And of these, the abandoned horse law deals with a public health and public welfare problem. 
    It's the problem of abandoned -- is perhaps a misnomer in our eastern sense of someone abandoning their -- of their personal property like an automobile or something like that. 
    It's a matter of dealing with uncontrolled animals running loose on the unfenced public lands, the range of the west. 
    The problem is that there may be owners, there very likely is for all of them, but there has to be an enforced control of some sort dealing with the circumstances. 
    And we have to keep in mind the vast areas in the small population and the policing problem. 
    For example, San Juan County, Utah which is District Number 9 on the Taylor Grazing Act is 7800 square miles, somewhat larger than the State of Massachusetts, it's one of the largest counties in the country. 
    The particular area which I will come to in a minute where these eight Indian families claim the rights is of itself 760,000 acres, larger than the State of Rhode Island. 
    The population of San Juan County is roughly 5000. 
    These give a picture, of course, their vegetation is sparse so that there has to be large areas for grazing and we're dealing here with widely dispersed people and animals. 
    Now, this abandoned horse law and I might say that it is not peculiar to Utah, Wyoming and Montana, for example, have laws that are identical to the Utah law on this subject, set out a procedure whereby the menace and it's a menace to the existing animals on the range, the menace of mixed breeding and the animals running loose are likely to be the lower quality animals or those things the matter of horses running loose on the range is a menace. 
    It's a public house problem, public welfare problem, a public health problem to these areas in the west to which their grazing is so vital. 
    It's far beyond simply the forage that the horse may eat. 
    Well, that is a problem enough, all the dislocations caused by uncontrolled horses. 
    That is the particular program we're dealing with here. 
    And other programs, you look in the statutes of the western states, you look under livestock or animals, you will see a gradient quantity of legislation dealing with these problems. 
    Now, up until 1934, these western states had all enacted that legislation dealing with the public range which was most of the range, and the matter of the rights to graze had been governed by custom. 
    No special federal statute.

    Mr. Marquis, assume -- assuming that the authorities know who the owners of these animals are and assuming that they know that they are not really abandoned animals but are mere trespassers on the public domain, are they authorized by the state law to invoke the Abandoned Animal Act?

    I would -- I would say, yes, to your question. 
    Of course, I -- I don't exactly agree with the assumptions. 
    But I would say, yes, to the statute. 
    The statute is dealing with the abandoned horses. 
    It is perfectly proper to invoke the statute which then simply puts on the burden of the animals the obligation to file a description of their animals and their brands and then there are measures for service by mail --

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    In the respondent's -- in the petitioner's brief, at page 58, the last page next to the cover. 
    “Any person owning any horses which are running at large in any county in which the Board of County Commissioners has given notice of intention to make a drive” as provided in this chapter, “may, within 30 days after posting or the first publication of the notice mentioned with the Board, file with the Board of County Commissioners a description of such horses claimed by him giving the marks and brands, if any, which appear thereof. 
    And if the Board of County Commissioners shall take into its possession any horses so-claimed, it shall, by registered level, address the owner or claimant of said horses, notify them and so forth.”
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="571.162" stopTime="573.420">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, were those things done?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="573.420" stopTime="581.176">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    There was no filing of description or brands in this case and hence there was no notice filed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="581.176" stopTime="582.995">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then was the Act followed?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="582.995" stopTime="595.632">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    The Act was followed in the publication of that there will be a roundup. 
    There was not only publication in the newspaper, there was posting in the county seat, there was posting in five places outside the county seat.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="595.632" stopTime="598.177">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why didn't they -- why didn't they follow the rest of the Act?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="598.177" stopTime="625.182">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Because the rest of the Act does not come into play until in response to the fact that a roundup is -- occurs, then the owner files with the Board his description of his horses and his brands. 
    When he does that, then anytime any of those animals are seized, then the registered mail notice is given to the owner. 
    And that is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="625.182" stopTime="639.011">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In one of those acts, don't they make a distinction between abandoned horses and trespassers in which event they impound the horses and give notice and -- and enable the owners to get them back?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="639.011" stopTime="650.737">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    The impoundment law is a different law which is primarily directed at the herds of animals rather than the horses as such, but it would cover horses. 
    In that instance, it's the impoundment law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="650.737" stopTime="661.858">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Isn't that to be used -- isn't that to be used in cases where they either know who the owners are or have reasonable opportunity to know who the owners are?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="661.858" stopTime="676.051">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    I think that's the case where there's been continuing trespassing by abandoned sheep or abandoned cattle, someone grazing or something of that sort. 
    There has been continuous trespassing and a problem then they invoked the impoundment law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="676.051" stopTime="676.660">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Had there not been --
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="676.660" stopTime="676.839">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    And --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="676.839" stopTime="678.057">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- continuous trespassing here?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="678.057" stopTime="826.833">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    But -- that's right. 
    And this impoundment law, the local impoundment law, had been invoked by the white permittees who were entitled to own -- to graze the land. 
    And as the record will show, that is one of these episodes when the county sheriff was there enforcing the local impoundment law. 
    The abandoned horse law is something entirely different for a different purpose. 
    Its purpose is to rid the range of these uncontrolled animals running loose. 
    And the procedure there is to pick up the animals and when they know a roundup is coming, then the -- as I say, the owners file the descriptions and the brands. 
    And, for example, in this case, there were many horses running loose, there are as many as 400 horses running loose on the range. 
    The Indian horses were some of them. 
    It wasn't known to which Indians they belong of these eight families. 
    They were all running loose on the range and the notice was given in accordance with the statute that there would be a roundup of the horses. 
    And as might be expected when the notice was given, “We're going to have a roundup,” and they go out and they start looking at the range, most of the horses had disappeared. 
    I think that is perfectly in accord, first, getting back to what I was dealing with, I think it's perfectly in accord with the Taylor Grazing Act which preserve local police power and which preserve in its very first section of the Taylor Grazing Act. 
    It said that the jurisdiction of state courts -- of states is not to be affected except so far as necessarily. 
    On the top of page 69, at the end of Section 1, it starts on the very bottom of 68, the appendix of the Government's brief, “Nothing in this Act shall be construed in any way to diminish, restrict, or impair any right which is heretofore may hereafter initiated under existing law validly affecting the public lands and so forth.” 
    And then it comes down to about the fourth line, “Nor as limiting or restricting the power or authority of any state as to matters within its jurisdiction.” 
    My first point is therefore that the Taylor Grazing Act was not intended --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="826.833" stopTime="828.820">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose that --
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="828.820" stopTime="829.656">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Sir?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="829.656" stopTime="834.732">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a statement of an equivalent proposition, let me tell you that.
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="834.732" stopTime="847.023">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    That's right. 
    I think I want first to say that it -- I think that's clear that the Taylor Grazing Act was not intended to supersede all of the local law as to grazing matters. 
    That --

speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="853.093" stopTime="877.540">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Well, I think -- again, we have one of those problems. 
    I think it leaves the local law except so far as there is conflict. 
    I think it makes it perfectly clear that section represents the policy and then there is the later section which is -- we didn't reprint it, it's in the petitioner's appendix.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="877.540" stopTime="886.748">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any definition in either the state or the federal law to what constitutes an abandoned animal?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="886.748" stopTime="887.516">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="887.516" stopTime="887.522">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What --
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="887.522" stopTime="967.723">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    At page -- the petitioner's appendix. 
    At page 55, at the bottom, abandoned horses defined. 
    The term “abandoned horses” used in this chapter means any horse and other animals unbranded or if branded, that has escaped assessment for taxation for the year next preceding the killing of such animal as here and after provided for and running at large upon the open range of this state. 
    An animal not bearing a decipherable brand recorded in the Office of Recorder of Marks and Brands shall be deemed unbranded.” 
    It isn't put on knowledge at all, it's a question, I think it's quite reasonable in dealing with this partially settled area. 
    It puts -- it puts the burden on the owner in this area where animals are running loose to have his brand recorded and to -- when the roundup is announced, to file with the Board of Commissioners saying, “Well, now this is my animal. 
    If you pick it up, let me know about it.” 
    And then the statutory process proceeds from thereon.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="967.723" stopTime="972.980">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does the record show whether these animals escaped taxation the year before?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="972.980" stopTime="977.484">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    The record is completely silent about taxation.

    They were branded, were they not?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="979.017" stopTime="997.186">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    They were branded -- some of them were branded. 
    Some, there is dispute. 
    The Government's testimony was that they had looked in the brand books and could find no recorded brands. 
    There was testimony the finding is some of the brands were recorded. 
    How many isn't stated.

    They're -- they were grouped.

    The Government, they will, I think. 
    Of course, it isn't the brand, it's the recording of the brand. 
    It isn't the brand on the animal when you're out on the range and picking up the horses. 
    It isn't the brand on the animal that makes the difference, it's the brand recorded in the book. 
    And of course they have brand books which our books contain the recorded brands and they have copies out on the range. 
    The testimony shows the government agents had the brand books with them.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1033.161" stopTime="1036.251">

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    I -- I say first, I think that the -- I don't think that the jurisdiction of the action under this statute is whether a particular animal was abandoned.

    I think the statute places the obligation on the owner --

    To do what?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="1073.651" stopTime="1092.702">

    -- to file his brand when the roundup is announced.

    Our challenge to the findings was not specific as to each particular finding. 
    We did challenge the findings as a whole and the ground on which inferences were drawn from the evidence on the ground that the basis of this alleged conspiracy between the federal officers and the local county sheriff and the local advisory board and all -- everyone else in the area was erroneous.

    Mr. Marquis, the finding that certain brands were recorded is about as rudimentary and elementary and simple and unambiguous to the finding of fact that one can conceive.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    And secondly, we think that the answer is, the answer throughout the case and the thing that dispels all the findings of that sort where evidence has been expressly rejected, the thing that cuts across all of that is the charge of the plot or malicious scheme to oust these Indians from an area where they undoubtedly had rights. 
    That is the theory on which all that flows throughout the case. 
    And we expressly attack that because of the fact that Congress had, I think, quite clearly indicated that these Indians should remain in their view upon the reservation and I think it's perfectly clear that as the state court held on this precise question, that for at least three reasons as a matter of law, the Indians had no rights in this area to graze, they were trespassers, that they be -- these six families belong on the reservation with the rest of the Indians who had been in this general area.

    He is violating the Federal Range Act -- the Taylor Grazing Act and the regulations set up a procedure for giving trespass notices, that's what they're always called in vernacular, it's a trespass notice, for those that are grazing their sheep or cattle either beyond the period of their permit or beyond the time during the year when it's permitted or too many sheep or too many cattle or many of those various reasons, it's almost invariably. 
    Some basis on which they're on the range on the permits of -- their exceeding a permit usually, but any sort of trespass of the cattle or the sheep by an owner is dealt with in the matter of procedure under the Federal Range Code in which notice is given and trespass action is taken either through the United States Attorney or the regulations provide invocation of local law of impoundment for trespassers which, for instance, in Utah law is covered by estrays.

    Out on the mesa on federal range. 
    You watched them move from the corral out there where you picked them up? 
    I did not. 
    You had a pickup there, didn't you -- a pickup car there, didn't you? 
    I was on Alkali Point 15 or 20 miles from the area where the horses were picked up. 
    Were you the only man driving that pickup truck that night? 
    No. 
    Who else was driving? 
    Bob Crum. 
    Later on he testifies very briefly. 
    Didn't you know they were coming out of his corral? 
    I didn't know they came out of his corral. 
    It was dark when he turned them out. 
    I can't identify any of those horses in the corral. 
    Then where did you take them when you picked them up? 
    And it goes on from there. 
    That's the government agents' evidence on the subject.

    Who was (Inaudible)
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="2973.494" stopTime="3158.563">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    A, the federal officers, range officers in the area. 
    B, actors in this -- in some of the episodes here were the Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff of San Juan County, Utah. 
    C, the Board of Commissioners of San Juan County, Utah, two of them testified and the Secretary of the Board testified and their testimony was rejected in part on the ground that it was all part of this conspiracy. 
    Next, the Advisory Board under the Taylor Grazing Act, which provides for a local advisory board to advise the local managers on operation and enforcement of the Taylor Grazing Act. 
    And finally, the white grazers who had permits to operate on this land and had been the plaintiffs in the state court circuit. 
    We say the answer -- and that flows through the entire picture of the case that you can pick out and view one or the other of these matters because of the view of the -- that that exist -- that plot or scheme was existed. 
    And we say that is simply not so because of one primary fact. 
    The assumption of all that matter of plot or conspiracy is that the federal officers and the local officers were attempting to oust these Indians from the area without giving them a chance to litigate their alleged rights. 
    Now, the fact is that I think the statute, it's very unusual, Congress had said in creating the extension of the reservation right next door to this area and most of the Indians had moved into the Aneth Extension in 1933 when it was created. 
    Congress had gone to unusual lengths in saying that there shall not be lapping over on to adjacent area. 
    And it had said that con -- it had provided contrary to usual law that no further allotments to lands to Indians on the public domain shall be made in San Juan County, Utah. 
    And it had provided that the Indian Homestead Act of 1884 which gives Indians a right to obtain homesteads without charge on public domain should not apply to San Juan County, Utah. 
    That it -- very clearly limited the Indian, the Navajo Indians to the Aneth Extension and to the Navajo reservation, that that is the view that has been taken throughout by the Government, that that was expressly passed on by the local county court of San Juan County and then the state court -- Supreme Court of San Juan County, Utah in a decision that is clearly correct and that the fallacy all the way through here is simply ignoring the existence of that fact.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    At page 3 of the record, about the middle of the page, number 14 as to conduct of trial and damages. 
    This is all under the heading, the Court -- District Court erred. 
    “In finding, without basis in the evidence or reasonable inference from the evidence, that it was the motive of the agents and employees of the United States both alone and in concert with white livestock operators to harass and molest the Indians and to kill their animals so that they would be compelled to leave the range and could no longer assert a right to use the area in question.” 
    That question was precisely raised. 
    The Court of Appeals like -- found it unnecessary to go into it because the basic findings, the basic facts are there. 
    We think it perfectly clear and up until now, I should say this, at page 84 of the record, the very beginning of the trial, I think it shows what's happened. 
    And in their reply brief, the petitioners in this Court quote certain excerpts along with that part, but the very -- those two sentences that they leave out where the Court is talking about alleged violation of its order and it's going to issue a temporary restraining order, he's talking about injunction. 
    Mr. Thomas, the Assistant United States Attorney, I wonder if it not might been -- it might not be my duty at this time to call attention to the decision of the Supreme Court of Utah. 
    The agent had previously said, “Well, I thought I knew the status, I was relying on that case.” 
    Of course, the case had been decided by the Supreme Court of Utah. 
    It held that these Indians were trespassers. 
    The fact is that one of these episodes which is described in the finding, the episode of the handcuffing of the Indian women, the finding doesn't mention it. 
    The man who put the handcuffs on was the local county sheriff of San Juan County, Utah acting under the state impoundment law. 
    We say that that is typical of this whole case that the fact is that as Congress had made so clear and as the Supreme Court of Utah had held expressly dealing with these subjects that the Indians were not entitled, this group of six families were not entitled to graze upon this area that they were obliged, they should go to the reservation and remain there. 
    That the issuance of licenses on the Taylor Grazing Act to the white grazers was perfectly valid and that they had the rights in the area. 
    And up till now until yesterday in the argument where it was said the decision was wrong, throughout the record in this case in the District Court, throughout the briefs in this Court, there has never been any indication of what is the answer to that state court proceeding which had been the Supreme Court of Utah had decided this case and held the Indians had the right prior to any of these events in May of 1952 and these were events occurred along in the summer of 1952.

    I'd -- I failed to see if it's by trial. 
    The problem is how is it within the scope of authority and yet still being a wrongful act? 
    I mean, rather than simply a mistake as to what their authority should be. 
    I think that's our problem and I suggest that there -- the dilemma I think is conversely illustrated by this injunction here where it's said to be justified, and of course, you can't justify it as an injunction against the United States, but is thought to be justified on the ground of an injunction against government officers which could only be if they were acting outside the scope of their duties. 
    In which case, they would -- certainly it seems to me the outside of the scope of their duties for tort liability. 
    I thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Norman M. Littell
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3698.329" stopTime="3698.454">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Littell.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="3698.454" stopTime="3909.665">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    If the Court -- if the Court please. 
    I can't pass wholly unchallenged the statement however immaterial in this case, bearing on its perspectives that Congress has sanctioned and insisted that these Indians move back to the reservation. 
    That simply isn't true. 
    I ask you to bear in mind the finding of the Court that these Indians dwelt here peaceably and the record shows that they did up until Kinneman came in 1946 as range manager. 
    And in 1947, their permits were canceled. 
    The record shows they were cancelled because they were given seven months permits and they wouldn't go to the reservation for five months. 
    There's not a blade of grass on that reservation as if the Commissions of the District of Columbia ordered my wife and myself to move in the apartment of our next door neighbors. 
    They're very nice people and I think we're reasonably nice people, but it simply wouldn't work. 
    There is no room. 
    That is the backdrop of drama behind this case in which the alleged plot, the proven plot or collaboration between the local ranchers, the county officials, taking in Kinneman and his crowd completely have moved in to insist that these people be driven back the reservation. 
    There is no power to order them to the reservation. 
    They were bona fide settlers, recognized conclusively as such by this very bureau itself, by the issuing -- issuance of permits. 
    Those permits could never have been issued if they were not in some way entitled to be there. 
    That's a long subject of title. 
    I know that and title is not in this case, but I couldn't pass on -- without notice of those facts. 
    And as you look at the record, you will notice the great difficulty that the Court had in getting the files, getting the records in. 
    At page 393, the Court asked who where the permittees here and there was great reluctance to give him the permittees and they never did get in. 
    They finally got a stipulated statement of facts as to what all the cattle were and the sheep in this district showing that from this case a pitifully small amount involved in the Indian issue. 
    And Mr. Black, agent for the Government, testified that out of an estimated 40,000, 30,000 belonged to one man, Charles Red. 
    The range of Sakezzie, when they cancelled his permit, was divided between Leland, Red and Velvet Red. 
    Those facts, even though the Court was unsuccessful in getting into the record the names of the permittees who were closing the vice on this little band of the last of the Mohicans in that area, still the fact show what was happening clearly and uncontrovertibly. 
    And who was in the front line trench when they conducted this operation. 
    The same ranchers, that Leland, Red went and got the gun. 
    The case can't go off on that of course.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What do you -- what do you say to this? 
    Assuming everything that you say is true that this was a malicious plot to destroy these animals to get the Indians out, what's your theory then on which the Government under the Tort Claims Act would be liable?
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="3925.975" stopTime="3957.692">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    The -- the Government is liable, Your Honor, on the theory that this is a wrong. 
    There has to be proved negligence, of negligent or wrongful act within the scope of authority. 
    And it's illustrated by the two questions I left yesterday, the truck driver acting within the scope of his authority, the male truck driver negligently hits a car, the Government is admittedly liable. 
    We have many cases on the negligence front.

    They were acting, Mr. Justice Clark, under specific instructions of their own bureau to proceed under the abandoned horse statute and they did so which means collaboration with the -- with the sheriff, with the Advisory Committee of the stockman and all that.

speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="4055.541" stopTime="4063.729">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    No, because we fall back on the part which I couldn't argue and submit it on the brief. 
    It's unconstitutional. 
    There was no notice. 
    The Mullane case --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well --

    The Mullane case, we fall back on other arguments but that's the principal one.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4067.708" stopTime="4081.609">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But apart from that argument then, even though you accept the motive as being to oust the Indians, that wouldn't get you a whole motive.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="4081.609" stopTime="4123.154">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    I think it's a part and parcel of the tort, but I believe that we would fall back if this Court held that the proceedings were perfectly regular. 
    And the abandoned horse statute was properly applied which of course as I pointed out just yesterday, it was not. 
    It's the other statute that should have been applied providing for notice like the federal regulation. 
    But if the abandoned horse statute was -- was sustained in this Court under all of these facts, I would still fall back from the fact that there was no notice. 
    And that was an unconstitutional seizure and confiscation of property.

    Your Honor, this is a liquid feel of which this Court is trustee for the country. 
    And that -- in this case of this violence in the confiscation and destruction of personal property by the wrongful acts of these agents with the authority of their department, is certainly not within the language of that act.

    It -- it wouldn't be wrongful.

    You get into a whole new area of discussion at that point on the question of right -- whether it be wrongful if it had been dully adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
    That would raise an entirely different matter, I think.
