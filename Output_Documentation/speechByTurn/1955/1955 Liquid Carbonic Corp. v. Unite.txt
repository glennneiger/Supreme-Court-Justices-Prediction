    Mr. James F. Dwyer 
    May it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me where in the record the Assistant Attorney General had indicated that he believe that if the judge granted an injunction of what constitute a modification of the decree, that colloquy will be found at page 6 of the record and I think that in conjunction with that, in fairness, you should read what Mr. Karsted later said at page 36. 
    That was the second hearing, and while on the -- at the first hearing, he felt that the -- an injunction would constitute on unwarranted modification. 
    After he returned home to Washington, he changed his mind and then informed the Court that he thought that an injunction would not constitute a modification, and it's at page 36 that he so informed the Court. 
    Now, before proceeding with my argument, I would also like to refer to a -- a portion of the record which I think bears upon the question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked yesterday as to what implications could be drawn with respect to Liquid's consent to the decree, and I said that such implications could be drawn as only we're consistent with a limited language used in Section 9 (e). 
    And I said further that I thought that the district judge had no power to resort to the philosophy of the Sherman Act or the allegations of the complaint. 
    And down at -- at -- fully on 53, in the middle of the page, page 29, the judge asked me, “Was the purpose of that,” that is of Section 9 (e), “to furnish new competition in an area whereby agreement between the parties,” it was determined not decided, “but determined that Liquid exercised a degree of monopoly,” and I rejected that contention and said that no such inference could be drawn. 
    But nevertheless, that is the inference that the judge drew that we had been found guilty of a violation of the Sherman Act and I express again that there is no basis whatever for any such deduction. 
    Now --

    Mr. James F. Dwyer 
    Yes, with an expressed statement that they -- the defendant had denied the allegations of the complaint. 
    I think in large part, that followed the usual kind of decree that the Government asked the defendant to sign, except at various places where modifications occurred and Section 9 (e) is one of them, those places. 
    Now, as I was saying yesterday, the -- the Court rationalized its order in this way. 
    It said that the purpose of the consent decree was two-fold. 
    First, to divest Liquid of its plants and secondly to bring competition into the area and opposition of course was that the purpose of this Section of the decree was to bring a competitor into the area and that we can send it to sell our plants on the assumption that the Government would find a purchaser. 
    Although, we had pointed out, and this appears in the record, to the district judge that we have reminded the United States and reminded the judge in the course of the -- the negotiations on the consent decree, that in our opinion, these plants would not be bought by anybody who would operate them as to CO2 manufacturing plants. 
    So, really, what was involved here when the decree was submitted was a contention on our side that these plants would not be sold but let -- we were willing to take the risk on our judgment on that point against the Government's insistence that they should have an opportunity to bring a competitor into the field.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="509.964" stopTime="523.354">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you mean, as the matter, at the time of the consent decree was under consideration by the district judge, if he have to be discreet, if he have even reach them, require as to the decree to which (Inaudible)
speaker="james_f_dwyer" startTime="523.354" stopTime="868.959">
    Mr. James F. Dwyer 
    No. 
    No, I can't say that he did. 
    He was kept informed that we were having these negotiations and some of them took place in his presence. 
    And from time to time, he asked us a reason for insisting on this or refusing to do that. 
    But when the decree was presented to him, so far as I can now recall, he -- he signed the decree as -- as a Pro Forma Act. 
    Now, the judge -- the judge said, “Well, since I can't compel a sale of the plant under this decree, I'll do the next best thing. 
    I'll stop you from using it, and in that way, we will have achieved one of the purposes of the decree. 
    Then, we will put Liquid out of business.” 
    And now, any -- his decree has brought enough as I said yesterday to prevent us from using the plant for anything. 
    We were in effect compelled to sell that plant as quickly as we can to avoid the cost of maintenance of the plant. 
    So, he -- he then entered an order which he said, “Your enjoined from using this plant and I'll deny the Government's motion for an order of sale without prejudice to a renewal.” 
    Now, the reasoning, it seems to me, becomes more involved on the judge's part, because in the first place, he said, “I can't compel a sale under this decree. 
    I have no power, but I'm going to imply that -- draw the inference that I can require association of use.” 
    And then, I asked him why. 
    He gave a Government leave to renew a motion, to put an order of sale when he's denied it, and his reasoning run this way. 
    He said, “Well, the Government has said in a brief that an injunction might involve it in a -- in a difficulty of policing, see that we're obeying it.” 
    And he said, “So, I then decided that if you didn't obey, they should have a right to come in here and ask me for an order of sale.” 
    In other words, he deemed it that and within his power of punishing for a contempt, should we disobey this order which had not yet been ended, that he could compel to us sell the plant? 
    The power which I think can't be found in -- in the equity powers of the Federal Court. 
    Now, it is our position that no searching for sustenance of power such as he endeavor to find here, going to the pleadings, going to the philosophy of the Sherman Act is permissible. 
    And we say that such an attempt is in -- it -- it contradicts the language of this Court in the Ford case. 
    Your Honors will probably recall that in the Ford case, Ford had agreed to disaffiliate itself with a finance company, on condition that the Government should within a specified time compel General Motors likewise to disaffiliate, and a consent decree was entered on that basis by the Government and Ford. 
    And for years, thereafter, the Government let lay a -- an action in the federal court against General Motors, didn't prosecute it. 
    And in Ford, a mode in -- in the District Court for an order releasing it from the shackles of this restraint that had been placed upon it. 
    The district judge denied its motion, gave the Government more time and this Court reversed the -- the District Court and required an order to be entered releasing Ford from the restraint. 
    And in connection with that release, this Court said that the district judge had no power to resort to the allegations of the complaint, because there, the district judge said, “Well, Ford in effect is -- is guilty of a -- of a violation of the Sherman Act,” but this Court said, “No such finding is permissible, because the decree was a consent decree.” That's the situation here. 
    There's no finding that we have violated the Sherman Act. 
    Now, I would like briefly to go over the subsections of -- of this Section 9 (e) to show, Your Honors, that there is no possibility of an implication of a right to issue an injunction. 
    Now, that -- that consent decree is in the record at -- what page is that one? 
    Yes --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="868.959" stopTime="869.808">

speaker="james_f_dwyer" startTime="869.808" stopTime="1092.543">
    Mr. James F. Dwyer 
    Page 83, yesterday I cited. 
    Now, subsection 1 of that Section states that within one year from the entry of the decree, Liquid showed dispose of the plants, quote “pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section 9.” 
    Now, it's not worthy that the plants includes not merely real-estate buildings and production equipment, but also production and sales records, which indicates that the plant was to be sold to somebody who would come in and operate it for purposes of competition. 
    And subsection 2 provides that the plants shall be sold through a trustee forthwith. 
    Now, terms of office were to be one year with the right of the Court to extend it, whenever a showing was made that there may be persons who have an interest in operating the plant. 
    As I said, his time was extended and he was unable to find anybody who would operate the plant. 
    Section -- subdivision 3 is designed to protect us from his for sale at an adequate price and as you will see, to bring a new competitor into the area. 
    It provides that the purchase price shall have a -- do regard for the evaluation made by the Court appraiser and that the plant shall not be sold to anybody who is connected with this defendant or with any of the other defendants in the action and -- and only to a person who will operate the plant for CO2 purposes. 
    And subdivision 4 requires us to maintain the plants at our customary standards until sold by the trustee. 
    Now, the judge -- now, the -- the Government of course insisted that -- that a sale of this plant would have the effect of -- of precluding us from selling or from operating within this area. 
    That's the very basis upon which this order is found. 
    Yet, that is a -- a truly erroneous conception because if the judge has power to enjoin us, then under Section 9 (g) of this decree, we can instantly commence the construction of a new and larger plant. 
    So, obviously, it wasn't the purpose of this decree to put us out of the carbon dioxide business in these two areas. 
    The main -- the purpose and the real purpose was to bring a competitor into the area. 
    Otherwise, why would Section 9 (g) permit us to come in and build a new plant? 
    Now, the -- the decree or the order of the judge in this case, also is in contradiction to this Court's decision in the Hughes case. 
    The Hughes case or the consent decree required Hughes either to sell his stock in one of the two companies. 
    That is the -- the distribution company or the production company or to put the stock in a voting trust. 
    He put the stock in a voting trust and then the United States came into the District Court and said we want the -- the stock sold because Hughes is -- is -- has an -- has an interest in the other phase of this business. 
    The -- this Court refused to order Hughes to sell the stock.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Davis.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1131.789" stopTime="1232.522">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    If the Court please. 
    Since this case in effect turns upon the construction of the original decree, I propose to start with the terms of that decree. 
    And I would call the Court's attention first to Section 13 of the decree which appears at page 90, 9-0 of the record. 
    Section 13 provides, jurisdiction is retrained for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to this final decree, to apply to this Court at anytime for such further orders and directions as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this final judgement. 
    Now, for the modification or amendment of any of the provisions thereof, the enforcements or compliance therewith and punishment of violations thereof. 
    I call the attention to this because this is the reservation of jurisdiction in the District Court pursuant to which the Government asked for this relief. 
    And it makes very clear that the parties themselves consented to appropriate modifications, appropriate constructions, appropriate orders -- orders for carrying out. 
    There is no -- there is no doubt that both the Government and Liquid Carbonic agreed that under appropriate circumstances, the Court should have power to make modifications.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1232.522" stopTime="1238.222">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What do you mean by appropriate circumstances?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1238.222" stopTime="1426.386">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That I -- I presume is the question, the basic question, is this an appropriate modification, is this an appropriate construction? 
    And I would think that an appropriate modification or construction was one which fell within the initial consent of the parties, but since the decree itself is based upon the consent of the Government and the defendant in the case, the modifications must in turn the based upon that consent. 
    And so, it must fall within the scope of the initial consent. 
    Turning from that, I turn to the Section which is directly involved in the decree. 
    That's 9 (e) of the decree which appears at page 83. 
    I may say that this is a suit which was brought against this defendant and several other defendants who are manufacturing carbon dioxide and dry ice, alleging monopoly and restraint of trade. 
    And with respect to this defendant, it was specifically alleged that Liquid Carbonic, one of the -- one of the actions complained of was that Liquid Carbonic had acquired a certain number of additional plants leading to monopoly. 
    So, it was -- it was natural that in the decree, there should be provisions for divestiture of -- of some of these plants which was alleged had resulted monopoly. 
    Section 9 (e) deals with that particular subject. 
    It starts of by providing that within one year from the date of the entry of the final judgment, “Defendant Liquid shall,” pursuant to the terms and conditions of this subsection (e), “dispose of as complete units its existing plants at Long Island City in New York and Indianapolis, Indiana, a divestiture provision, a provision that they should get rid of these plants.” 
    But not consent -- not content with merely honoring divestiture as a finished twist to this particular section of the -- of the consent decree which required not only that they divest themselves of these plants but that they sell them to potential competitors so that there could be active competition in these particular areas unless a reduction of the monopoly. 
    And that provision contained in Section 3, subsection (3) of this 9 (e) which states that the trustee shall dispose of these plants to persons who will manufacture on carbon dioxide and dry ice or both. 
    In other words, an attempt was made to force the defendant to sell to competitors. 
    Now, as Mr. Dwyer has told you during the year and a half following the decree, the trustee was unable to make this decision of these plants in accordance with Section 9. 
    Unfortunately, the decree couldn't say what was going to happen when that -- when that occurred. 
    And so, when it became --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1426.386" stopTime="1431.231">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, suppose it didn't require much imagination to contemplate that intention?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1431.231" stopTime="1474.388">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I -- I think it didn't, but as the parties -- whether -- in any event, the parties made no provision for it and the question then was, did that mean that nothing happened or did it mean that the divestiture should be carried through in some other matters? 
    And it was defined better that the Government went to the Court and said that we haven't been able, the trustee hasn't been able to complete the sale in -- in accordance with Your Honors order is the decree to be frustrated. 
    They -- are we not to get -- there's nothing to happen or is something to happen and we asked that -- the Government asked in that case that it be sold without being sold to competitors, that it be sold for real estate value or for any other thing, just divested. 
    It seeks to be used to reduce the monopoly.

    There is the provision in Section 9 (g) with respect to increasing the total number of production units.Such appears at page 85, Your Honor. 
    That's the same section as Section 9, but 9 (g) deals that this -- that Liquid shall not increase the total number of productive units.

    They wanted them to be sold to competitors.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, it -- it may be the matter of dropping. 
    They start in by saying they shall dispose of these plants. 
    And then, they spelled out a method of disposition and it may have been an oversight not to state what happened if they didn't dispose of them in that way. 
    That -- that must be our assumption, my assumption.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1652.951" stopTime="1679.947">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But they have provided in the decree that it should only be sold for fairer value that they should have an appraiser, recognized appraiser to appraise it and there's the aim that that contemplates a fair market value of -- of these plants as a growing concern. 
    That's the said value of it if it's closed out.

    Mr. John F. Davis

    Is there any language that do indicate that they had any other intention on that?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1684.508" stopTime="1779.802">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No. 
    The -- there is no language in the decree itself. 
    In order to determine, however, the -- the purpose in this decree, I think we have some help because of the fact that the judge who signed this decree after what he says is months and months of conferences, hours and hours of dealing with this matter has stated that it was his understanding that the consent of the parties to this disposition was for these two purposes. 
    And he states this specifically in his -- in his opinion in this case that he believe there were two purposes involved in this -- in this particular Section 9. 
    One, to require a sale to cut down on the productive capacity of the defendant, and two, what I call that the twist that was given to it, not only that they should sell them, but that they should sell it to a potential competitor. 
    Now, the Court, -- naturally the parties for this consent decree, look at this -- looking at this thing from hindsight will disagree as to what the -- what the intent was. 
    We each see it, see the intent from our present argument, but the Court who was then in an impartial position and who was passing upon this matter of a court order from the point of view of protecting the public, carrying out the purposes of the Act, the judge believed that the consent of the parties in this case was to achieve these two objectives, and that is specifically found as I say in his -- in his opinion in this particular case.

    It has to have been something which was comprehended within the original agreement. 
    The -- the position of Carbonic is that the sale to a competitor was really a condition of the order to dispose of these plants. 
    That -- that I think is -- is a peculiar -- peculiar argument because it is -- it's unusual to -- for a person against to whom an order is issued to make a condition which adds a hardship adds an additional sanction against them. 
    This is, if -- if you're going to spell out what they claim the original order would have said. 
    It would have said, you are ordered to sell these plants -- we -- no. 
    We agree that these plants shall be sold, but we agree that they shall be sold only if they shall be sold to competitors. 
    That would be the way they'd have to -- to interpret the consent of Carbonic. 
    We agree that -- that these plants shall be sold, but only if they are sold to competitors. 
    Well, that's an -- that's an odd side of the condition. 
    Ordinarily, if one -- if one condition to his consent, he conditions it by some ameliorating factor.

    Mr. John F. Davis

    There was a motion filed by the Government. 
    It was filed in December of 1953 for this modification. 
    Note -- a note is given to the -- to the defendant. 
    The defendant submitted some affidavits with respect to it and there was oral argument before the Court, in January of 1954, about a month after the -- the order was -- the notice -- the motion was made. 
    Then, the Court held it under consideration for quite a long time and came out with this -- with an order for the injunction rather than disposition and Liquid Carbonic said, “We weren't prepared for that. 
    We want a re-argument.” 
    And it was given a re-argument in June of 1954. 
    All told that was -- there were two long arguments before the Court. 
    There was one deposition affidavit introduced by the -- by the defendant. 
    There was a period of about eight months in there. 
    Liquid Carbonic did not request the opportunity to introduce other evidence, and indeed, it hardly seems that -- well, I'm not sure there are any factual matters that the Court felt needed to be discussed. 
    The Court had the -- the Court interpreted its original author as being -- as including a sensation of operation of these plants. 
    It said, that's what we intended to do in the beginning. 
    We intended to stop production from these plants, but we intended to do something else. 
    We can't do anything else. 
    We certainly want to do at least this. 
    We want to stop the production.

    That's right. 
    Then, to -- to summarize where we came up, the real -- the real issue in this case is whether or not the consent of the parties which presented to the -- which was given to this original decree, really comprehended. 
    This was large enough to include this order which has since been issued by the Court. 
    Fortunately, the -- the authorities in this Court appeal when they're clear, the modifications which are proper must be modifications which are designed to carry out rather than to frustrate the initial purpose of the decree. 
    That is what was specifically stated in the -- in the Chrysler case and there was no statement in the Ford case that drawn away from -- from that legal concept. 
    The question is will this order which is now requested carry out what the parties intended at the time they consented? 
    Will it carry out the purpose which the Court, and we must remember that this isn't merely an agreement between parties, this is an order of a Court designed to carry out a public purpose expressed in the antitrust law. 
    Well, the order which is required carry out the intent which the Court had in issuing the initial order.

   Rebuttal of James F. Dwyer

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Dwyer, would you in just a minute of so to state your position on due process so far as the failure to accord your company any hearing on this modification of the party.
speaker="james_f_dwyer" startTime="3034.352" stopTime="3123.299">
    Mr. James F. Dwyer 
    Yes. 
    We were served merely with a notice of motion for a construction of the decree and we opposed it on the ground that the Court had no power to order a sale from the language in the decree. 
    And -- well, I think you will find in the argument that -- and in the briefs that we submitted. 
    We pointed out that any sale now would constitute a modification and the minimum that we're entitled to was a hearing. 
    The Court would have to have witnesses before it to prove how competition was going to be effective if the plants were to be sold. 
    We had no such hearing. 
    The Court in his opinion felt -- thought that it was entirely unnecessary with just a matter of construing this language. 
    We pointed out to him that carbon dioxide had been used to more industries. 
    It was used in hospitals that he'd have to take into consideration what the effect on the economy around the Indianapolis area would be. 
    But he seemed to think that that was not necessary. 
    We think that due process requires the Court to give us an opportunity or rather to -- to -- an order, that such an order may be ended. 
    That the Government proved that there is some relation between the wrongful act alleged in the complaint and the relief which they're seeking.
