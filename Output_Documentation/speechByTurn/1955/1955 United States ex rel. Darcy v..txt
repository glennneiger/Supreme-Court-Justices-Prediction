    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 323, United States of America on the relation of David Darcy versus Earl D. Handy. 
    Mr. Lawley, you may proceed.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    At the close of yesterday's argument, Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked me the question as to whether the question of Judge Boyer's statements and actions had been raised before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    The answer, sir, is yes and the Supreme Court stated in its opinion that it could find nothing in the statements or actions to indicate anything prejudicial to the petitioner.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="38.930" stopTime="40.671">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The judgment was on the merits this morning.
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="40.671" stopTime="102.301">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Yes, sir, yes, sir. 
    And in answer to the Chief Justice's question as to whether the District Court made findings of fact. 
    There were two judges who sat in the District Court. 
    Judge Murphy and Chief Judge Watson both conquered in the findings of fact contained in Judge Murphy's opinion. 
    They stated that he had failed to prove his allegations and they concluded that he had -- that he had received a fair trial. 
    On the first broad allegation of hysteria and prejudice, Darcy was represented at that trial by experienced trial counsel. 
    The District Court found as a fact that he knew in March the trial was in June. 
    He knew in March that it was the intention of the Commonwealth to start Darcy's trial immediately after that of his coconspirators, yet we find that there was no motion or change of venue nor for a continuance and that --

    I beg your pardon.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    When did they sever the case?
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="105.913" stopTime="108.306">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    In March, in March, sir.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="108.306" stopTime="109.017">
    Unknown Speaker 
    In March?
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="109.017" stopTime="232.607">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    In determining the significance of the failure to ask for a change of venue or a continuance, we cite Mr. Justice Clark's statement in Stroble versus California wherein he stated that to determine the significance, to determine whether there was history and prejudice, he thought it was significant that two deputy public offenders in Los Angeles had not requested a change of venue. 
    And a similar statement is contained in United States versus Rosenberg in the Second Circuit. 
    Chief Judge Swan there stated that if counsel did not realized the importance of newspapers at the time, there is no reason to believe that the jury did either. 
    We have in our brief, beginning on page 39, charted the procedural facts of the three cases, Stroble, Rosenberg and Darcy. 
    In the three, we note that in Stroble the question was first raised immediately on motion for a new trial. 
    Here, the question was not raised until present counsel raised it some two years later. 
    He now makes a statement that it was where the Court sua sponte to move to change the venue. 
    We say that this cannot be done. 
    Under Pennsylvania law, a defendant has a right to trial by a jury of the (Inaudible) and for the State or for the Court to have changed it, would have denied him of this constitutional right. 
    Further, our Constitution provides that the Court shall have the power to change venue under the provisions of the law. 
    The law, the statute states that venue may be changed on application of the defendant.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="232.607" stopTime="238.857">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is your -- have your court any power to deal a trial by a newspaper for the trial in court?
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="238.857" stopTime="299.508">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    If -- if the defendant would raise the question, yes, we do have the power to change the venue if the defendant feels that the newspapers are unduly exciting the people. 
    Here, there was no manifestation at his trial that in any way, shape or form, the newspapers had created an atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice. 
    There is no situation here akin to Moore versus Dempsey, Frank versus Mangum or any of those. 
    The District Court so found and specifically the Court of Appeals affirmed that finding. 
    There is no showing, there is no proof that the jury was in fact influenced in anyway by any newspaper article. 
    There, the proof is that the jury, as a jury, after selection read nothing that they were segregated. 
    They were kept free from access to any forms of communication.

    May I point out that first there is no proof that they did in fact read it. 
    Secondly, I would like to point out that the intelligence, sir, has a circulation or did have at that time of approximately 5000 in a county of over 100,000 population. 
    Next, I would like to point out that we have printed the voir dire examinations of the jurors printed as an appendix to our brief. 
    The record today is the same as it was on -- in June of 1948 as to what the jurors did read. 
    There's no proof that they read anything more or anything less than what is contained in their voir dire examinations.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I would like to point out further the question of hysteria and prejudice was not raised on direct appeal. 
    When counsel -- when trial counsel was assisted by Thomas D. McBride, the present Chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar. 
    As to the articles --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="499.655" stopTime="506.490">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that I may know. 
    Mr. McBride is part of the trial counsel or merely on appeal at the first time.
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="506.490" stopTime="515.707">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    On appeal, sir. 
    He was not trial counsel. 
    The trial counsel was Mr. Achey, who is dead and Mr. Power and they were engaged --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="515.707" stopTime="517.169">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. McBride took it up.
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="517.169" stopTime="519.589">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Mr. McBride took it up in association --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="519.589" stopTime="521.308">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's that is so connected.
speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="521.308" stopTime="760.880">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's the end and then Mr. Margiotti took over from there. 
    If I may serve -- serve the papers themselves, the District Court specifically found that the newspaper articles were factual in nature. 
    The editorials to which the counsel for the petitioner refer, there were nine during the period upon which he relies. 
    In point of time, they range from three days after the crime until a day before the trial. 
    Only two of these refer to the defendants and then the reference is indirect. 
    The allegation here is that there was an out of court campaign to secure the death penalty for the defendants. 
    We say it is difficult to determine how there was such an out of court campaign in view of the fact that Exhibit 42 contained on page 998 (a) of the record concludes that if these defendants are sent away for impressive periods, it should discourage forays into the county. 
    If -- we submit -- if it was an evidence of a campaign to get the death penalty, the statement to send away for impressive periods has no -- no meaning. 
    Further, the editorials refer to professional jurors in Philadelphia, they refer to crime in general but there is no campaign proved. 
    There has been no campaign proved to secure a death penalty for these persons. 
    His -- in -- in fact in main, his argument is that the adjectives used in the story were prejudicial to the defendant. 
    The facts as to these adjectives that they were bandits and so on came out at his trial as they did in Stroble versus California. 
    There the adjectives used, we submit, where much worst and much more widespread because we were dealing there with Metropolitan papers of the City of Los Angeles where a werewolf, fiend, sex mad killer and so on. 
    The facts came out at the trial and this Court held -- affirmed the judgment in that proceeding. 
    He further states -- petitioner further states that there was an alleged feeling in the community against these people, against these defendants. 
    He stated yesterday that I call witnesses from all walks of life to show this. 
    Seven witnesses were called. 
    There was an aunt of one of the conspirators. 
    There was the sister of Darcy, (Inaudible), an attorney for Zeitz who is now dead, a friend of the family, a doctor who examined Darcy and who wrote a letter to the governor seeking clemency and two preachers. 
    The testimony of these persons as the District Court found was not oriented as to time, as to place, or the person on -- in our attempt to bring it out from whom they heard this, we clearly unsuccessful. 
    They could not say when they heard it, where they heard it or from whom they heard. 
    But even so, Reverend Damroach stated that even under the facts that he heard he was not willing to say that there was prejudice against these people and that's contained in the record. 
    And Reverend Babinski, at the time when the hysteria and prejudice was supposed to be sweeping the county, after this heist trial, he stated that there were no expressions of threats or violence and that there was no change of feeling. 
    There was indignation, yes and we submit that there would be a strange community where there would not be in the indignation.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Lawley, the jury in this case were they drawn generally from the countryside of maybe from Doylestown.

speaker="frank_p_lawley_jr" startTime="771.998" stopTime="798.886">
    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    The jurors answers on the voir dire contained in our appendix, we submit, indicated that there was no fixed opinion. 
    This Court has held that the mere reading of the newspapers alone does not disqualify and that there was no indication that they would not decide this case on the facts and the evidence presented.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    He pleaded not guilty, sir, but the entire proceeding is an indication that there was an attempt only to save him from the chair. 
    As a matter of fact, present counsel on page 7 of this brief, states that he did engage in a robbery and while fleeing a person was shot and under the law of Pennsylvania that is murder in the first degree. 
    So that the question was for the -- as to the penalty alone and Mr. Farrier, an attorney for our for our coconspirators stated in the District Court that he got into the case solely with the idea of saving Zeitz or saving his client from the chair.

    Darcy was on the screen, ten seconds. 
    The group of the four defendants was on the screen, 15 seconds. 
    Other than that, there is no showing of any other TV coverage. 
    There is no showing of the number of -- of TV sets back in 1947. 
    There is no showing that any of the jurors had TV sets.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    The uncontroverted facts concerning Judge Boyer I believe to be this. 
    First that the morning sessions and the afternoon sessions when Court convened he was on the bench, the reason for that is it was the practice in Bucks County at that time that prior to the start of any trial or what was going on in that courtroom, they had a miscellaneous session where there were motions rule to show cause and so on. 
    The evidence says that sometimes, immediately, upon the conclusion of the miscellaneous session, he left the bench. 
    In other times, Judge Keller, the presiding judge stated that he remained on the bench and listened to the evidence. 
    The uncontroverted evidence further is that at onetime --onetime during the trial he did participate at sidebar in a ruling on evidence on a difficult question as characterize by the trial judge, the difficult of question of evidence. 
    It was at sidebar, the District Court specifically found that it was out of the hearing of the jury.

    Some of our statutes, old statutes provide that in certain counties you had to have two judges. 
    Today, in counties where there is not a separate judicial district where the population is small so that one judge serves two counties. 
    It is required that there be a lay judge, not learned in the law, a lay judge who also must sit with the -- what judge learned in the law to conduct a trial. 
    The -- there's a reference to it in our brief, an article by President Judge (Inaudible) the former President of Pennsylvania Bar Association wherein he details the history of two judges presiding at a trial.

    First, there is no proof as to what this note was supposed to have contained. 
    Secondly, the District Court specifically found that the note was not passed. 
    Third, the Court of Appeals majority refused to disturb that finding. 
    Fourth, Judge Murphy found that he was not even present at the time. 
    Next, there is a conflict in the testimony among Darcy's own witnesses as to how this alleged event was supposed to have occurred and we set that out to considerable detail beginning on page 63 of our brief. 
    The three persons who testified as to this were a brother of Darcy, an aunt of Darcy and a friend of the family. 
    The three persons, two of whom related to the defendant testified that this occurred significantly enough, even though they testified that they have been talking about it for six years. 
    They did not bring it to the attention of trial counsel nor to the attention of appellate counsel. 
    We submit that the possibility of recent invention is there. 
    If this was such a great disturbing thing, would they not have brought it to the attention of counsel for their brother or there nephew as the case might be.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    The -- the -- if I may, sir. 
    I think first, the District Court findings are supported by the record. 
    Secondly, I think the Court of Appeals in -- in considering it did not specifically go in and check in to find what evidence there was or was not as to his specific findings. 
    If I may further point out in this note passing incident, the tipstaff sitting immediately behind the jury on the other side of the courtroom stated that it did not, that no note was passed. 
    The District Attorney stated that he was seated on another table during a majority of the charge. 
    But an even more importance, there is no evidence here that this jury, and isn't that the important question as to whether this jury saw any note passed. 
    During a charge of a Court, where is the jury looking? 
    At the trial judge listening to the matters that he is giving them, the charge that he is giving him on the evidence and on the law. 
    The jury is faced, is sitting on onside of the courtroom facing the judge in the center of the room, the occurrence was supposed to have taken place in the extreme other side of the courtroom. 
    We submit that first it did not occur. 
    Secondly, if it did, there's no showing that the jury in anyway saw it. 
    And thirdly, there is no showing that they were in anyway prejudice by it.

    They were dealing here with a case where admittedly it was a cold-blooded murder where the confessions were not repudiated, where there was no contradiction of the testimony and the -- even counsel today admits that it was first degree murder. 
    The only question for them was the penalty -- I mean that would give them any problem was the penalty and they were persons that you will read from the appendix, persons of maturity, persons from diversified walks of life who we feel entered -- entered the jury box with open minds and who gave a verdict on the evidence.

    The problem in this case is whether the comment of Judge Boyer in view of his relation to the -- this crime and enforcement of -- of your statutes of murder in this crime, so behave himself and he didn't decide, did not assume responsibility and was in charge with this, involved including of an alien force in the content of the trial.

    Mr. Frank P. Lawley, Jr. 
    Sir, I think that is the question and I think further the answer is that it did not because the -- the facts are that he sat one time and he sat as a spectator. 
    There is no showing that many of these other things occurred. 
    They -- what is done is they take the newspapers hearsay as truth. 
    In -- in many of the showings for example, they -- they conclude that he was personally prejudice because of the statement in the sentencing of this -- of the coconspirators a week before of the verdict. 
    What did he say? 
    He says, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't see how under the evidence your verdict could have been any -- other -- any different. 
    Under the evidence, the evidence there was the same as it is here, that it was uncontradicted. 
    And -- and in addition, may I say that in Pennsylvania, if he had been the only judge in the county that his statement in front of the Foster-Zeitz jury would not have disqualified him from carrying on the week, the following week in the Darcy trial. 
    In Pennsylvania, the opinion of the trial judge as to the evidence, as to the penalty, as to the guilt is proper and in some cases are court's have even said under circumstances it's his duty to give his opinion to the jury and that, one of the key cases is Commonwealth versus Simmons which is cited in our brief. 
    Now, I think I've -- I've answered all the questions except the one of Judge Harlan.

    This Court denied certiorari. 
    Then it went back to the District Court, a hearing was held and again they said it was a fair trial. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision and I might say that in the dissent of Judge Kalodner, there are many things that there is nothing in the record, the staring at the jury. 
    There is nothing in the record that would indicate that. 
    Finally, I would say that this case has been longtime between the -- the crime and the present time and that the passage of time itself may indicate in your minds that possibly there's something wrong.

   Argument of Charles J. Margiotti

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Margiotti.
speaker="charles_j_margiotti" startTime="3320.033" stopTime="3413.541">
    Mr. Charles J. Margiotti 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, please may I first set address to time that Judge Boyer died. 
    He died August the 9th, 1951 which was sometime after we filed our petition for a writ of habeas corpus which petition set forth the charges that are involved in this present proceeding against his conduct. 
    At that time he was ill but not too ill that he couldn't have testified but there's no effort made by the common law to take his deposition and in that last illness, of course, he died and during that time petition was filed and the Commonwealth filed an answer to our petition. 
    And there was a decision by the lower court in a reversal in that meantime. 
    Now, as to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Your Honor, and Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the Supreme Court merely acted on our petition. 
    What we did, we filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, setting forth substantially the same facts that are set forth in the petition here involved for the purposes of exhausting our state remedies. 
    And the Commonwealth filed an answer, I believe, I'm not too sure about that part be that as it may, on that petition in answer to Supreme Court, refuse the hearing and never heard the facts. 
    And then of course --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then --
speaker="charles_j_margiotti" startTime="3441.555" stopTime="3759.459">
    Mr. Charles J. Margiotti 
    -- point in this case and I'm just coming to that but I want to clear up some of this early points. 
    I want to clear up too about these questions about abduct -- a two men court in Pennsylvania. 
    There is no such thing. 
    I applied cases in over half the counties in the State of Pennsylvania. 
    Both to say private practitioner as Attorney General and I've never heard of the practice of -- of a two-judge court or a three-judge court in the trial of cases, never, never occurred and I've tried many, many homicide cases both for the Commonwealth and for the defense, numerous cases and that has never occurred in my entire experience. 
    It's the most unusual thing. 
    This two-man court is a -- is locked at in Pennsylvania. 
    It occurs in only two or three Districts where we have small counties and two judges sit with the presiding judge, not one but two and they're lay judges, farmers, businessman, ditch diggers, anything so long as they can get votes and they're called a judge and we all took fun at them. 
    We called them judge and they liked to be called a judge and they enjoy that and all they do is sign papers and writs when the -- when the presiding judge is not in the county but in his own county. 
    He has to come from another county and to those small counties and they're only two or three districts where that occurred and they don't advise the trial judge on questions of law and before in the to trial. 
    They're consulted on the question of silence and that's as Mr. Lawley had said. 
    Now, the chair referred to where Judge Boyer sat has been called a chair for the tipstaff. 
    That is not correct. 
    The evidence is all to the effect that that chair as well as all chairs within the railing like it is in here are set aside with members of the bar, not for a tipstaff. 
    And the tipstaff, the person in charge of the jury sat on the upper -- other side. 
    And so far as Judge Boyer is concerned, that is the crux of this case. 
    My opinion that that is the most important thing than my opinion is conduct, shocks the conscience of the ordinary individual. 
    I've never heard of such conduct. 
    You can search your own minds. 
    You're all experienced men in trial of cases and hearing cases that you ever heard of such conduct of a judge, particularly a judge could express himself who had been held as a judge in favor of the death penalty for these boys and that had appeared in the newspapers. 
    There isn't only one newspaper as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in those times, but that newspaper carried -- was a correspondent for the Bristol newspaper which is the other large town in the county and was published over there and it was carried over and ready. 
    All these facts, with that expression and that feeling when they granted the severance and when they objected to the granting of severance on some penny-pinching justice idea that they would like to try these cases all together. 
    It's going to cost money and they made statements like that from the bench and then half of the trial of the case as judge made these statements and there's no and it was respected and it was in the Court and the acts of manner which he did. 
    There is no question of what this conduct was shown. 
    Now, what did he do? 
    He went on the bench. 
    They say, they started out and they put up a trial balloon by taking the position that's necessary for Judge Boyer to go on the bench every morning. 
    Every morning in order that they would dispose of miscellaneous business, then he would withdraw and go to some other courtroom and wouldn't appear again. 
    Well, that balloon soon was punctured and naturally punctured because it didn't stand under the facts. 
    He came back and he participated in the trial and what punctured it was the record. 
    And that was the first thing I had as to his conduct when I read the record and I saw he sat on the bench and he participated in a ruling unfavorable to the defendant. 
    And that -- that was a very, very important ruling because it involved the question of whether or not testimony of previous misconduct on the part of this defendant should be admitted as evidence. 
    Achey take the position, should not -- the State taken the position, yes, it should because that kind of evidence will help the jury in passing on the penalty. 
    And they take with the --

    How do we know it?
speaker="charles_j_margiotti" startTime="3878.656" stopTime="4060.523">
    Mr. Charles J. Margiotti 
    You'd know it from the -- from -- we don't know it. 
    So far as -- as so far as Judge (Inaudible) concerned, he testified that he, thereafter, left the bench but he doesn't say how soon thereafter he left the bench. 
    Judge Keller who was a trial judge was brought into court all the way from Philadelphia to (Inaudible) from the southern part of the State to the northern part of the State and it was in that courtroom as a witness, and I thought they're going to call him as a witness. 
    They refuse to call him as a witness but they presented a certificate in which he stated what he knew about the situation and they introduced a certificate. 
    I objected to it on the ground that the best evidence was a judge himself since he was in court. 
    They refused to call him. 
    The Court took the certificate. 
    Judge -- Judge Keller left, went back to Doylestown. 
    I was thinking of calling him and I was going to take some risk in doing that but being a judge I was going to call him anyhow but he -- when I went to call him, he was gone. 
    And so far as his certificate is concerned, you'll find it on page -- pardon me for taking up a little time, Your Honor. 
    My -- I have a bad eye. 
    I have a kind of an operation, I can't help -- where is it? 
    The certificate is found on page 1133 (a) and was reference to this transaction in paragraph -- in page 1138 (a). 
    He says, on several occasions, he says, during the Darcy trial, the Honorable Kelvin S. Boyer, the additional law judge occasionally joined the undersigned and sat with them at the beginning of several sessions of Court, devoted to the trial of a case for the purpose of transacting miscellaneous business. 
    After which, he withdrew when the case was in progress. 
    On several occasions, however, Judge Boyer remained for brief periods while evidence was presented and that's the judge himself who sat on the bench and did the ruling. 
    Remaining for brief periods on cross-examination, I could have had developed what those brief periods were whether they were 10 minutes or a half hour, what he meant by brief periods and how many they were, but they didn't have them for cross-examination. 
    On one of these occasions and then he went on, it goes on tells what occurred with reference to that particular ruling that was made. 
    And --

    Could you tell us, Mr. Margiotti, the basis for statement in Judge Hastie's opinion that is quoted in Judge Kalodner's starting opinion.

    I can't just quickly do it for you but I'll do the best I can but while -- while I'm going to something else that will be done. 
    But I know that that occur because it was definite evidence on that particular subject because (Voice Overlap) --
