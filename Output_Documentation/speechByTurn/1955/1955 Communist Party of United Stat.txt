    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Mr. Forer.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1.144" stopTime="383.891">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Because my time is running out, I can just touch lightly on some -- a few of the remaining subjects that we wanted to discuss. 
    One of our points is that the Board's order must be set aside because of the Board's improper reliance on remote and discontinued practice. 
    The Government agrees with us that the Board's findings and order under the Act had to be based upon relevant policies and practices of the petitioner subsequent to the date of the Act. 
    But if you look at the Board's report, you'll find that the Board didn't base itself upon that at all. 
    The report ranges over the entire 33-year history of the petitioner mingling into one big stew, a few shreds of alleged contemporary happenings and a great bulk of remote matters. 
    Most of the report deals with the 1920's and the 1930's which was the period before petitioner disaffiliated in 1940 from the Communist International, which as I said earlier, itself dissolved in 1943. 
    The report shows that these practices, if they ever existed, were discontinued years ago, yet despite change in circumstances, despite the uncontradicted denials of petitioner's witnesses, the Board indulged in a presumption that these practices which had been discontinued, if they ever existed for at least 15 years, were still in effect and so did the court below. 
    Now, the only defense that the Government makes is to say that well, the Board really didn't indulge in the presumption but all you have to do is read the Board's report at the place cited by our brief, read the Court's decision and you will see that it did indulge in that presumption, that presumption itself was legal error requiring the setting aside of the decision below. 
    On the question of sufficiency of the evidence, I want to call to your attention the fact that under this Act, the Board's findings must be supported by the preponderance of the evidence in place of the usual standard of substantial evidence. 
    Much of what I've already said such as the Board's torturing of the standards, the 13 (e) and it's reliance on remote evidence already indicates how lacking in evidentiary support the Board's order is. 
    But perhaps the most vivid illustration appears in the opinion below. 
    There you'll find that the Court of Appeals said that it sustained the ultimate finding on the basis of six factors. 
    This boiled down to the fact that the petitioner says it adheres the Marxist principles that its ultimate goal is a classless, stateless world that it calls itself the Communist Party and that it takes positions on foreign policy similar to those taken by the Soviet Union. 
    That's the basis on which the Court sustained the order. 
    All these facts petitioner stated in its answer to the Attorney General's petition before the Board and petitioner has always proclaimed them. 
    They do not and they cannot prove the petitioner is under Soviet control or operates to advance the terrible objectives described in Section 2 of the Act. 
    I can't dwell on, but I want to call the Court's attention to our motion for leave to adduce additional evidence made in the court below and denied by it. 
    The Act authorizes the reviewing court to return the case to the Board to receive additional evidence on a showing that the evidence is material. 
    We move to reopen for this purpose, showing that after the administrative proceeding was over, three of the Attorney General's principal witnesses, Harvey Matusow, Paul Crouch and Manning Johnson have so exposed themselves as perjurers that the Department of Justice had itself abandoned their youth, recognizing their other unreliability. 
    The denial of that motion compromises the administration and reputation of justice. 
    I think if you will read the motion and the affidavit of the facts on which the motion is based, I think your consciences must and will be shocked. 
    I want to conclude and in summary by saying that the Act and its application here are an unprecedented invasion as Mr. Abt pointed out, a fundamental principle of the Constitution in our very democratic society. 
    This Act was enacted in the excitement of the Korean War. 
    In the name of anti-communism and the familiar but spurious cry of security, it would enforce conformity by suppressing peaceable advocacy and association using the odious technique of governmental defamation, not only of people but of writings and ideas. 
    Inevitably, this police state objective generated police state procedures. 
    The Act and the Board's order coerce self-incrimination. 
    They determine guilt by fire, paid labor writings, they establish arbitrary and irrational standards of proof, the Act creates a biased tribunal that has an interest in the event, it deprives individuals of their livelihood and liberty for innocent association and in this case the reckless use of unreliable witnesses has been condoned. 
    If these breaches of the Constitution can be upheld against the petitioner and its members, they can be and they will be used against other organizations and individuals. 
    The Act has already moved on from the Communist Party, the so-called Communist fund organizations, the so-called Communist-infiltrated labor unions. 
    Having started to outlaw the Communist Party, it can go on with a techniques used by the Board here to destroy, say, the ADA or the NAACP or the fund for the republic. 
    We say and we think the record in this case bears this out that this position of this case will determine whether traditional liberties in this country already severely restricted will survive. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Simon E. Sobeloff
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="383.891" stopTime="387.933">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="387.933" stopTime="1198.258">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    May it please the Court. 
    The argument -- the arguments which you've just heard seek to cast the question in terms of a violation of a First Amendment but we do not see the case in that light, and we'd like to be understood at the outset to agree, nay, to insist that utterance, however it may diverge from popular opinion or from official opinion and no matter how close or odious, is permitted and protected. 
    And efforts to change people's minds and beliefs are immune from any interference under the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution and a man is free to preach any doctrine. 
    But in -- in preaching doctrine, the couples there with conspiratorial plans to employ illegal means to subvert and destroy this Government, Congress may deal with it and the First Amendment does not stand in the way. 
    A mention was made here of the President's veto. 
    The President made some very serious criticisms about this bill which was passed over his veto as the Court knows, but he has this very significant sentence which is the only pertinent sentence to this case, the President said, "Insofar as the bill would require a registration of the Communist Party itself, it does not endanger our traditional liberties." 
    In a document that stresses the importance of these liberties, this distinction is clearly recognized. 
    Now, what is the history and background of this statute? 
    We can't consider the thing in a vacuum. 
    Let me review briefly what led to this enactment. 
    What was the world situation in 1950 when Congress enacted this law? 
    For a generation or more, Congress as well as the rest of the world has been observing the activities of a world Communist movement that has its center in Moscow. 
    As early as 1931, almost a quarter of a century ago, William Z. Foster, the present president of this organization boldly told a committee of Congress that more advanced workers in this country look upon the Soviet Union as their country. 
    Congress -- that they held a whole series of coup de tat in Europe. 
    They had seen successively this following up by the Soviet Union through military aggression of some of its neighbors like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland and Finland and Congress had also witnessed as that of the whole world that this world Communist movement directed by the Soviet Union had by infiltration, by subversion, by fraud, deceit and the threat of force where force was not necessary. 
    They had taken Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Romania, Albania and for a time Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. 
    And Congress had not failed to note what a single quisling could accomplish in a strategic position and that since strong attempts made by the same methods to dominate Greece and Iran and Italy and France. 
    And in common with the rest of the world, Congress had noted with consternation the steady growth of this international movement and it's taking over in the most populous nation on the earth, China. 
    And they have noticed obvious preparatory moves to take over other parts of Asia. 
    Moreover, Congress had only three months before the passage of this law, who voted funds, to raise an army to send it to Korea to resist aggression of the same -- from the same source, neither Congress nor the President nor the nation thought that these events were of slight significance to our safety. 
    Moreover, there was a certain characteristic that was employed in this world Communist movement and it was emerging into clear view. 
    Evidence of espionage in England arranged through Klaus' books and in Canada through Gouzenko, who like books later confessed, that had become known and while Congress did that then know about Petrov's espionage in Australia or Maclean and Burgess in England. 
    The judgment that Congress expressed in 1950 have since then been confirmed by later revelations and Congress was not unaware what was going on at home. 
    In 1949, the year before the passage of this Act, there had been the conviction of the 10 leading officials of this Communist Party of the U.S.A., the very men who are leading this movement and that conviction had been affirmed only a month before the Act was passed. 
    Now, as a result of these manifestations, Congress had become convinced as all the world had been convinced that there exists a Communist -- a world Communist movement and they have become convinced too of its eventual purpose that it was directed toward other nations and toward this nation in particular because it was regarded as the chief bourgeoise imperialist power. 
    So, summing it all up, I think it is an understatement to say that there was at least primary -- a prima facie evidence. 
    Some would say it was overwhelming evidence that this world movement had a well-organized agent or agents in this country. 
    Congress had also observed with mounting concern that there was not only this Dennis conviction but that the Party had from time to time in its propaganda and its activities faithfully reflected the Soviet Union's position, sometimes reversing itself with startling suddenness always acting, however, in consonance with the Soviet Union ships of policy. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Jackson summarized it in a sentence, he said, "A chain of command from the Kremlin to the American Party is stoutly denied and usually invisible but is it was unmistakably disclosed by the American Communist Party somersaulting in synchronization with ships in the Kremlin foreign policy." 
    Now, I will not take time to recount the details of how when this Soviet Union zigged, they'd zigged along and when the Soviet Union zagged, they zagged too and when the Soviet Union took snuff, they would sneeze. 
    Now, the petitioner admits that there is a world Communist movement but it claims that it's a loose affiliation that its comprised of separate independent parties that there's no time, loyalty or discipline between it and the Soviet Union. 
    It's only a fraternal or philosophic affiliation. 
    It's more like a chess club as you heard here this morning, a group of nature lovers, a sort of a glorified Boy Scout movement. 
    Now, that's not the conception that events require us to have of that Party. 
    Congress did not believe these professions of disaffiliation and there was ample evidence to support the view that that disaffiliation was not sincere, it's a spurious move. 
    The testimony in this case by one of the officers of the petitioner, Mrs. Flynn, was that it was friendly divorce in 1940, a friendly divorce, a sort of a divorce by mutual consent by proclamation. 
    It was something to present to the world and Gouzenko said, "Announcement of the dissolution of the Comintern was, probably, the greatest farce of the Communist in recent years. 
    Only the name was liquidated, with the object of reassuring world opinion in the democratic countries." 
    Actually, the Comintern exists and continuous its work. 
    Now, all this was before the Commission, not only the Royal Commission in Canada but it was before the SACB, and SACB concluded that the evidence preponderates wasn't merely some supporting evidence, it preponderates to establish that the disaffiliation was for the expedient of avoiding registration as a foreign agent and that it did not alter the Party's relationship to the Communist International or the world Communist movement. 
    In other words, would -- business was going on as usual. 
    It was only a friendly divorce. 
    Now, the record also shows that the Party changed its name in 1943, it became no longer the Communist Party, it was known as the Communist Political Association. 
    But in -- that was during the war when they wanted to create a semblance of unity with the American people. 
    As soon as the war was over and Russia's interest seemed to diverge from that of this country, they again reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party of the U.S.A. 
    This very tactic of name changing is that according to the documents of the Communist International thesis treated as an approved method of concealment. 
    Now, Congress whatever else may be said about them, they don't have to be naïve as little red riding hood who wondered about grandma's big ears. 
    They have a perfect right to view the facts and to make their appraisal and to draw their inferences. 
    Now, with this body of knowledge and experience, Congress declared their -- the existence of a danger and the vitality -- the validity of these congressional findings that is the existence of the peril, I respectfully submit, must be accepted by this Court if there's any rational basis for Congress to believe. 
    I submit that it's almost difficult to imagine a rational basis for disbelieving it. 
    Now, coming now to the validity of the law itself, what are the issues that are here? 
    It's important to know that before we start with the consideration of the law. 
    The whole law is not properly an issue here. 
    There's no reason why this Court should go into every possible imaginary case that may or may not arise in the future. 
    When Communist-front organizations are moved against and anyone fancies that its rights have been violated, this Court will be here to protect it -- to protect them, but it is not necessary and now when you're dealing with a Communist Party of the United States to imagine cases that have not yet arisen and that may never arise, we're dealing with this Party. 
    Now, there's no so-called front organization here. 
    There's no record involving any individual here and these hypothetical cases do not call for determination now. 
    So far as the Party is concerned there's only one command in this order, the command is registration and the consequences to the Party are simply that it must label its propaganda, there's no prohibition of their preaching, disseminating their doctrines. 
    They must label their publications and their broadcasts to identify the source and also deductions that people make to their -- I mean contributions that people make to them are not tax deductible. 
    My contributions to the Republican Party are not tax deductible either and the many patriotic people who contribute to the Democratic Party suffer the same fate. 
    So, I don't think it's a great depravation to the Communist Party to say, "We will no longer recognize them as a charitable institution entitled to special treatment." 
    Congress has certainly the right to take that step.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May ask you, Mr. Solicitor General. 
    What I am to infer that if I correctly understand that one of the disabilities of a member of a party after a judgment of -- such as is entered here and supposed to be affirmed by this Court has been entered, a member of a party who is dismissed from a -- from a defense plan is entitled to get an injunction, temporary injunction against enforcing that dismissal until, what you say, are still serious questions of -- what you say are still questions of law, you didn't say are serious, are still questions of law and determined by this judgment are finally being adjudicated (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="1246.797" stopTime="1462.826">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    Exactly. 
    Exactly so, even have his remedy by injunction. 
    May I say this, I'm authorized by the Attorney General to say this. 
    In the legislative history, you'll find some discussion in the Senate, not when this law was passed but when the 1954 Act, a much more drastic law was passed. 
    That 1954 Act undertakes to amend in some respects the 1950 Act, one of the chief amendments was that it included a new classification, Communist infiltrated organizations. 
    The old law dealt merely with Communist-action and Communist-front organizations. 
    And then incidentally, it revised certain -- under appeal certain sections. 
    And in this Senatorial discussion, there was some intimation that perhaps sanctions became operative at once against people -- against members and it appears has been expressed by some people writing about this thing that, "What does that mean? 
    Does that mean that a person who is not listed with whom the Attorney General may think ought to be listed may wake up to find that he's been violating the law and that he is subject to penalties?" 
    I'm authorized by the Attorney General to say that no such person will be proceeded against except by notice on the hearing. 
    I don't mean that there will be a hearing as to the nature of the Communist Party. 
    There will be a fair hearing as to his relation to the Communist Party and as to his knowledge but the whole thing is really going to be academic. 
    No person can even under the law without any interpretation, emulative interpretation, be proceeded against who, even if he's listed, wishes to disaffiliate. 
    Now, I know we in a democracy have great tolerance for stubborn people, but I think it's carrying stubbornness to a great extreme to say that a man may go on and persist in membership in an organization after it has been adjudicated by this Board created for the purpose of considering the matter and with the affirmance of the Court of Appeals and after this Court has considered the matter. 
    And he can say, "I still don't believe that it's a foreign-dominated organization that has these nefarious purposes that have been attributed to it, I insist on belonging to it." 
    I think that's carrying it too far. 
    This is not mere political association, this is conspiracy to destroy the Government and the whole fallacy of the arguments that you've heard is that they are predicated on a so-called political party character of the Communist Party. 
    It's true it has some of the character -- characteristics of a political party. 
    It has slogans. 
    It has a philosophy. 
    It calls itself a party. 
    All that would be all right no matter what doctrine they preached but they go beyond that. 
    The evidence has established and on judicial review that has been affirmed that this Party is a part and parcel of an international movement dominated by the Soviet Union and that its purpose is by force and violence if necessary to take over this Government.

    May I ask you this question? 
    Does that mean that the statute entitles the accused party or any of Communist-action organizations to a hearing whether it does believe in accomplishing -- in achieving that objective by force or violence and put that issue of the means by which this world objective is to be accomplished to -- initially to prove or is the right to a hearing foreclosed by legislative predetermination?
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="1520.956" stopTime="1542.249">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    All right. 
    I'll answer it this way. 
    In the first place, I know that Your Honor's question pertains to the world Communist movement, not to the character of this petitioner, the world Communist movement. 
    If you'll ask me as to whether Congress may declare that there exists a world Communist movement and its characteristics, I say Congress can and has done so.

    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    Well now, I don't know what Mr. Justice Frankfurter had in mind. 
    Of course I want to draw a distinction between a congressional finding as to the nature of the world Communist movement and a congressional finding as to this petitioner. 
    Congress has made a finding of fact as to the nature of the world Communist movement, that's I think in Section 2 of the Act of 1950, this Act. 
    But even that finding, though I fully believe that Congress was within its right to characterize the world Communist movement, even that finding was amply supported because there are two sides of the coin in the course of proving the relationship of the Communist Party of America to the world Communist movement, the nature of the world Communist movement itself was also fully established.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- the 1954 Act has nothing to do with this.
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="1930.073" stopTime="2162.342">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    The 1954 Act was nothing to do with this, it's important to know that and -- and the definition of what is a Communist-action organization under the Act that is before you which appears on page 229, Mr. Justice Reed. 
    It's an organization in the United States, any organization in the United States other than the diplomatic representative or mission of a foreign government which is substantially directed, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in the other section, Section 2 and which operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in Section 2 of this title and the finding of the Board affirmed by the Court of Appeals is that this petitioner answers to that description. 
    That was not assumed. 
    That was the thing principally to -- to be proved. 
    Now, what is the sanction against this petitioner? 
    That it register. 
    I say it's a very mild requirement if any faith is to be given to these findings. 
    Nothing could be more reasonable that an organization that has been duly in -- in an orderly way shown to be the handmaiden of a foreign power and whose objective it has been to destroy this Government. 
    Nothing could be more mild or reasonable than to say that such an organization shall at least register and make disclosure of its members and of its funds and that -- though it isn't silenced even now, it shall at least tell the public who's speaking. 
    The whole idea of free speech is that it ought to remain free, it shouldn't be suppressed because we believe that through speech the truth will finally prevail and that the nation ought not to suppress it because we have faith that when people are properly informed they will come to the right conclusion. 
    But in this welter of discussion, when you have someone speaking as the secret agent of a foreign government, whose purpose it is to subvert this Government, Congress has a right to say that one who has been proven such shall at least label its contribution to the public discussions so that people could know how to evaluate it and there have been other instances of registration. 
    It's not a new or unusual thing. 
    There's the Lobbying Act that this Court has upheld. 
    There's the Corrupt Practices Act that this Court has upheld. 
    The New York anti-KKK law has been upheld by this Court. 
    Second class mailing privileges can be enjoyed only after there is a full registration as to the ownership of the newspaper and yet nobody thinks that that violates the First Amendment. 
    The rationale is that by registration people will be informed and be able to know what the speech really means. 
    Their -- if they know the motivations, if they know the source, they know how to appraise it. 
    And in the light of our knowledge of the Communist movement and of the proven objectives of this organization, Congress has been very moderate, so far as the organization is concerned, in requiring only this registration. 
    Now, there's been talk about the self-incrimination provisions.

    Well, I'm asking you the question of whether you can short circuit the violation of a criminal act where you require somebody to register or -- or a person and this would, I suppose include a person or association of a person or a corporation or a partnership to require them to register if they are engaged in certain activities, you have likened this to a simple Registration Act and I'm with you on the idea that you can require registration. 
    If that were the case, they would be tried for failing to register but the Government would have the burden of proving that they were engaged in the kind of activities which were define there.

    I don't think it's practical or necessary under the Constitution to do that. 
    It's simply impossible to have a 15-month trial on this side issue in the case of everybody that's going to be proceeded against. 
    You don't go into the nature of the Communist movement all over again. 
    You don't have to prove all over again each time that the sun rises in the east. 
    You do have to prove in each case fully, beyond a reasonable doubt, the connection of the particular defendant with the movement and that he knew what he was doing and even if he's been connected with it, if he wants to absolve himself of these burdens, all he has to do is disaffiliate. 
    Of course if he insists that he still wants to belong to it then he has to suffer the sanctions. 
    But he has an opportunity to get out and if he's going to be prosecuted, he is entitled to have it proved beyond a reasonable doubt before a jury that he had knowing affiliation with this condemned organization. 
    But it is not necessary in each case, of each individual to go again afresh into a proof of the nature of the world Communist movement or the particular organization of which he is a member. 
    That's already been done by the Board.

speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="3090.730" stopTime="3288.633">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    Now, may it please the Court, on this question of self-incrimination. 
    There are several answers to the arguments that have been made here this morning. 
    In the first place, the issue was premature. 
    If there's anything that's been settled conclusively with regard to the claim of immunity under the Fifth Amendment, it is that it does not apply to an organization. 
    It only can apply to an individual. 
    There's no individual before the Court asserting any such right and it applies only to natural individuals who explicitly claim that right, that immunity. 
    This Court can't assume it will be claimed. 
    Now, if Mr. Dennis were to claim that he's entitled to immunity from answering that he is a member of the Party and that's what they say is really required of him when he is asked to register for the Party. 
    Here is a man who has testified again and again or was said in public again and again that he is a member of the Party. 
    It's never been denied. 
    This Court or no court would automatically grant him his immunity because as this Court recently pointed out with the (Inaudible) case, the judge before whom that claim is made has to appraise the genuineness of the claim. 
    If it is really asserted in order to prevent the incrimination if there's real danger, he is entitled to that immunity. 
    If he's asserting it merely to -- as a cover-up for others, he's not entitled to it. 
    If a man has really admitted it again and again and he's in no jeopardy by reason of this question, he would be denied that. 
    It would depend on all the circumstances which would have to be developed in a record. 
    That record is not here. 
    You're not dealing with an individual. 
    You're dealing with an organization. 
    An organization cannot make that -- assert that claim against self-incrimination and even as an individual it depends on who the individual is and what he is asserting. 
    If you asked Patricia Blau about her membership in an organization, she is entitled to stand mute and say, "No, I won't -- I won't incriminate myself,” or Joe Blow but when you ask Eugene Dennis or William Z. Foster to register and he says, "That will incriminate me," a judge would have to examine and pass on whether or not that really would incriminate him. 
    We don't have to determine that today. 
    That's not the issue. 
    You have -- don't have that defense -- that party here. 
    You only have the Communist Party here and it is not in a position as an organization to raise that personal immunity. 
    Now, they say --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3288.633" stopTime="3299.580">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General, by that -- by that same argument, what would happen to an officer of -- of this Party who did register for the Party --

    Raise it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3314.002" stopTime="3322.716">

speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="3322.716" stopTime="3356.359">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    It might or it might not be so, it depends on the circumstances. 
    Now, let me illustrate right here. 
    Suppose Mr. Dennis who has been convicted of that offense were to raise it, the person has already been convicted and punished for that offense, may be in no position to raise a claim of immunity because he's not in jeopardy. 
    He might be. 
    I don't know. 
    It would have to be inquired into. 
    The judge would have to pass on it after inquiry. 
    This Court can't -- can't foresee just how it will arrive.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, just take the -- just take those bare facts that -- that I mentioned.

    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    I would -- I would concede that the immunity granted in this statute is not as broad as the danger might be in some cases. 
    But I don't think this Court can assume that the danger to these officers is greater than the immunity that the statute grants. 
    You'll have to wait to see until the question was properly before the Court. 
    Normally, a person who is not known as a Communist and who's asked to register could claim the immunity. 
    And even these men if they really want to claim the immunity someone could say, "I'm an officer of an organization. 
    I'm an officer of an organization that's been required to register, but I -- that would involve disclosing my identity as a member of the organization. 
    I claim my immunity. 
    Mr. Attorney General, I will not file it for that reason. 
    I claim my immunity."

    If he file --

    It was the basis for it that you -- he would have asserted it properly.
speaker="sherman_minton" startTime="3454.570" stopTime="3461.683">
    Justice Sherman Minton 
    If he filed under compulsion, that certainly wouldn't waive his right to claim the immunity if later on he requested it.
speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="3461.683" stopTime="3522.110">
    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    He would not have to file it. 
    He would say to the Attorney General, "I am entitled to an immunity. 
    I -- I raise that claim now and therefore I return to blank or I will not -- I will not file it.” 
    Then the question would arise if they tried to compel him as to whether he was really compellable or was entitled to the immunity. 
    But that would depend on a variety of conditions that might pertain to his particular situation. 
    Some people would certainly be entitled to it, others might not be. 
    I think it's much more dubious in the case of these people who have been publicly appearing in Madison Square Garden making speeches as officers of the Communist Party. 
    I don't think you can off hand and before the record is here say that such a person will be really jeopardized than incriminated by a disclosure. 
    I think that this Court would rather have that question arise on a record.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3522.110" stopTime="3533.068">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I -- I suppose all of these -- this Act was designed to have register those people who were not known publicly, isn't that right?

    Justice Sherman Minton 
    Well, of course the registration is not so much to disclose the identity of the individual who will act for the company -- for the organization. 
    They're, I think, pretty well-known.

    But other people whose names -- a list of members would be disclosed, information about their propaganda would be disclosed and of course the labeling and the other sanctions would follow. 
    But you don't have an individual claiming his -- his immunity. 
    It's doubtful whether in the case of these officers the immunity can validly be claimed. 
    I don't want to have argue that they're not entitled to it because I don't know what circumstances may exist and this Court can't know. 
    All I'm saying is that now you don't have any individual. 
    There's been no assertion. 
    You can't assume there will be an assertion. 
    You can't assume that it's asserted that it ought to be allowed. 
    All you know is that the organization is here claiming that on its face it's invalid. 
    But now, they can comply without violating -- it's conceivable that they can apply -- comply without violating any individual's rights or that individual's rights will not even be asserted or if asserted that they will not be correctly asserted. 
    And the assumption of their argument is that nobody -- nobody under any circumstances can be -- have to file. 
    I think it's an assumption that the Court ought not to be -- to be making in the absence of -- of a record of facts.

    Now, if they're going to be disintegrated because they persist in this conspiracy, I don't know that any constitutional right has been violated. 
    If they want to affect their real and not a spurious disaffiliation, the statute makes provision for them to do it. 
    Now, all that is happening in the meantime is that this Party has to label its propaganda so that people can determine what it is. 
    Now, you're not dealing -- if they're going to be a political party and nothing more, they can change their character.

    The various -- may I suggest that the various questions as I understand it and has been put to you clearly all converge to a comprehensive problem in this case as argued here and I say that because I assume it helps counsel to know (Inaudible) the court has, at least one has. 
    It all converges to this central problem mainly, what procedure may Congress have done it being conceded what I suppose that being certainly much fairer. 
    But if it left all these that could define the offenses, left their determination to the conventional fee of a judge -- of a jury presided over by a judge, there won't be any doubt that that would be all right to illustrate what seems to me to be to be the -- the essential difficulty in which suppose there is one, whether it's the problem raised by this case, what I mean by difficulty (Inaudible) 
    This Court has held that -- that if someone comes in, in this country, a board may decide that he is not attributing and finds that he's an alien and he's not entitled through a judicial determination of that power. 
    This Court -- there's no -- you need to apply that in a later case through a deportation proceeding which citizenship is so important, we wanted to have a safeguard of a judicial determination because on the whole experience shows judicial determination of plaintiff security best likelihood that's going along with the administrative.

    It doesn't substitute them for the definition.

    I -- I'm not here to defend every Act of Congress as wise and I don't think I have to lecture that subject to this Court or -- or to the member who is addressing this question to me.

    No.

    I don't -- I don't think it's a necessary -- a necessary test. 
    Now, the Douds case is authority for the proposition that Congress may say to a man, "If you want to be an officer of a union, you've got to resign from the Communist Party." 
    The Douds case decided that. 
    Now, if you can say to a man, "You can't be an officer of a union if you're a member of the Communist Party."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5342.303" stopTime="5349.479">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That isn't quite like the Douds case, certainly you can't be an officer of a union that wants to evade itself to the facility of the Labor Board.

    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    Yes, they are stripped of certain rights just as this Party here in -- in this case. 
    So after all, this is no child's play, the -- the Congress has a right to -- to put some teeth in this law but it isn't an irrational, it isn't a savage thing to do and if you give them a full opportunity to be heard and you determined the nature of the organization and you give them an opportunity periodically, if they really sincerely can show that they have changed, they can -- they can be relieved of the consequences. 
    If on the other hand, they persist then they can't say were -- we're being denied rights.

    No, but it -- there's this difference. 
    In the case of the lobbyist, all in -- he is doing is disclosing his activities, it's not inherently an unlawful activity. 
    Here, these people have been shown to be engaged in unlawful activity and I think that -- that makes a big difference.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5455.813" stopTime="5465.073">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but a question was raised as whether -- whether he has a right to show that on his trial or whether he has to rely on the finding of some -- some board --

    Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff 
    If -- if on his trial, he is one -- that he can show or convince the -- the Court, the jury that he's one of those innocents that Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke of, I suppose there would be a verdict of not guilty.

    That he can't say. 
    He can't say that the -- that I'm going to re-litigate the character of the organization. 
    But if his lawyers can convince the jury that he is really an innocent, that he did not understand the character of the organization then he would be found not guilty. 
    That much would be open to him, not the character of the organization but the character of his connection with the organization.

   Rebuttal of Joseph Forer
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5891.610" stopTime="5893.674">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    I think I have about two minutes, Chief.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5893.674" stopTime="5895.891">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5895.891" stopTime="6020.952">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    As I understand the Solicitor General, he now in substance concedes that a registration order against an accused organization for all practical purposes will destroy it or cripple it, proscribe it, outlaw it, put it out of business, call it what you will. 
    Nevertheless, he says this is not a First Amendment case. 
    He says nobody has a constitutional right to engage in a conspiracy to overthrow the Government, of course that's true and I put aside for the moment the question that there was no proof of such a conspiracy in this case. 
    Let's assume there was proof. 
    Let's assume it was proved that the Communist Party is a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. 
    You can punish that conspiracy, if the Court please, but you can't prohibit a conspirator and this is the Chief Justice's illustration if I understood it, you can't prohibit that conspirator from engaging in legitimate peaceful advocacy. 
    Solicitor General says but none of their advocacy is legitimate or peaceful because it's all for a bad motive. 
    When they say we're against race discrimination, when they say we're for higher wages, when they say we're for peace, they are really doing this as part of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government. 
    I submit, if the Court please, that one of the oldest devices of intolerance was -- is to say, "Yes, you're doing a good thing but we're punishing you because they do it for a bad purpose." 
    As soon as the Government has the power to punish a legitimate activity because it labels that activity as being done for a bad purpose, you've armed a government with the power to suppress all legitimate activity.
