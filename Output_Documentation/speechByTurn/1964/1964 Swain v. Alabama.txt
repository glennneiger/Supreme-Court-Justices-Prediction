Swain v. Alabama

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Petitioner in this case is a Negro male about 20 years of age. 
    And he asked this Court to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama which affirmed his conviction and sentenced to death on a charge of rape. 
    The petitioner was convicted of raping a 17-year-old White girl and was sentenced to death by a heavy jury sitting in Talladega County, Alabama. 
    No Negro has ever served on a heavy jury in Talladega County because they are always struck from the trial jury venire by the states attorney.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    It's life or death sentence. 
    Petitioner claimed below of course and asserts here that his conviction violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the grand jury which indicted him in the petit jury which tried, convicted and sentenced him were the products of racial discrimination. 
    Now, in a capital case in this county, the circuit judge orders the sheriff to summon at least 50 and not more than a 100 persons to serve on the petit jury. 
    About 75 usually appear of the 100 that are summoned and of these numbers there will be some who claim exemptions and others will be excused for various reasons. 
    And then of the number left, say there are 50 left, the striking then begins in this fashion, the states strikes one and the defendant strikes two.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes. 
    The defendant can inquire, and the state may inquire and examine the jurors and I understand the Court can excuse anyone that the Court feels does not qualify to serve. 
    Now, the Supreme Court of Alabama found that there are usually Negroes on the venire. 
    Negroes are usually in the jury box and called but the Negroes are always stricken and no Negro has ever served on a petit jury in that county. 
    And the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the fact that the prosecution peremptorily strikes every Negro from the jury panel in the case where the defendant is a Negro does not constitute a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights of due process or equal protection of the law. 
    Clearly is felt --

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg

    Pardon me?
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="528.807" stopTime="531.582">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Do you attack only the petit jury or do you attack the grand jury also?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="531.582" stopTime="638.589">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    We attack the grand jury also. 
    We say that, that's our second point here and that is that the grand jury and the petit jury drawn from the same box but what you have here is few Negroes in that box because the jury commissioners have not carried out their constitutional duty to fairly acquaint themselves with all qualified jurors in the county. 
    They have a very haphazard method of getting names in that box which favors a larger proportion of Whites and qualified Negroes are obviously not put in the box. 
    They have a small number to start with. 
    Now, as I said, this record clearly established that in every case, Negroes are struck from the venire and the prosecutor or the Solicitor's own testimony is that whenever he has a case he goes over to the lawyer in the other side. 
    He says, “Look, we have some Negroes here. 
    Do you want to use Negroes?” 
    And if the defense counsel says no and he invariably does and if the Solicitor doesn't want to use them as he says, “We strike them first.” 
    In other words we get -- rid of Negroes. 
    Now, the prosecutors never struck any Negro because he felt that a particular Negro had a bias against the defendant or the state. 
    He never struck any Negro because he felt that a particular Negro or several Negroes on that venire would not afford a fair and impartial administration of justice. 
    His only consideration --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="638.589" stopTime="643.095">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But those reasons would be all be for cause, I suppose if you could show --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="643.095" stopTime="643.890">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="643.890" stopTime="658.243">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But we're talking now about preemptory challenges and I -- that the very word preemptory as well as the history of preemptory challenges indicates that I had thought that the person could be as capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or prejudiced as he wanted to be --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="658.243" stopTime="658.517">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="658.517" stopTime="659.431">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- in challenging the jury.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="659.431" stopTime="697.369">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    But there are some instances where the Solicitor cannot prove bias, you say. 
    And if he attempts to prove in a case that a particular Negro might be biased in favor of the defendant because he is Negro and fails, he may then challenge that Negro peremptorily and that's not because of the Negro's race. 
    He's then using the preemptory challenge in the manner in which it was intended. 
    And that is to eliminate bias which you could not prove on which you merely have a suspicion or a whim and you get rid of the Negro that way. 
    But --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="697.369" stopTime="717.186">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But -- we always did use the preemptory challenges that way (Inaudible). 
    I thought may be he looked at -- maybe sort of a stance and the discussion. 
    If I had a challenge left, of course in my jurisdiction we had six challenges, they didn't have unlimited challenges --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="717.186" stopTime="717.908">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="717.908" stopTime="729.868">
    Unknown Speaker 
    -- you do in Alabama. 
    But do you mean to say here that the lawyer before you can use a preemptory challenge that shows grounds like bias.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="729.868" stopTime="802.663">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No. 
    I think that it is not absolute in that sense. 
    That was never the original purpose of the challenge. 
    Its purpose was to secure an impartial jury and to provide for the elimination of bias and it wasn't -- I guess it is used in the manner which you suggest and wholly arbitrarily. 
    But I don't think that that was the original intention of it. 
    I think it's always been limited by the necessity of a fair and impartial jury for the defendant and the public's interest in the impartial administration of justice. 
    So that in every case I would think that we have -- we would have the burden of course of establishing that race was the motive and it maybe difficult in some cases. 
    But the preemptory challenge we say cannot be used to and affect defeat the decisions of this Court construing the Equal Protection Clause or to violate the federal statute which says, that no state officer may exclude Negroes from the jury on account of race and that --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="802.663" stopTime="814.556">

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="814.556" stopTime="844.360">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well again, the question would be whether there -- that the challenges have been used to discriminate against the whole racial group in the community. 
    If he struck Negroes because they have to use six challenges but whenever he struck, he always struck Negro. 
    We might be able to prove that even in such a case the prosecutor's motive was racial discrimination.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="844.360" stopTime="879.663">

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="879.663" stopTime="935.795">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, our position is that the prosecutor here had a policy of excluding Negroes. 
    He did it through the use of preemptory strike. 
    He says so because I always strike Negroes. 
    I go overnight, talk to the other side and I -- we come to an agreement and we take the Negroes off. 
    And this record shows that his use of the strikes was to affect racial discrimination. 
    This Court has ruled that they cannot exclude Negroes from the grand jury panel or the venire and it shows that they made some attempt here to put some Negroes on. 
    But he used this to affect racial discrimination. 
    And our point is that any state prosecutor who uses his preemptory challenges to affect this result, the exclusion of the whole racial group violates the Equal Protection Clause.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, that -- that's our second point as I pointed out before that the striking is facilitated by the fact that the jury originally composed that it's a box as a result of racial discrimination. 
    I think the record is clear here that Negroes were about 26% of the males in that county over 21. 
    And in other words 26% Negroes were potentially qualified but the largest percent that had ever appeared on a grand jury panel or petit jury panel was 10%, 12% or 15%.

    We put on testimony to show there were other qualified Negro.

    And the statute certainly requires that. 
    So that it's clear by their own admission that there were Negroes outside of this box who were not qualified. 
    And this small number of qualified Negroes being put in the box facilitated the striking when it came to that. 
    So you can tie these two things together of course, and show that this is clearly a case where you have a state policy of excluding Negroes from their proper participation in the administration of justice and participation in the jury system.

   Argument of Leslie Hall

    Mr. Hall.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    I'm quite surprised that Mrs. Motley didn't go into the other questions. 
    She saves three minutes for that. 
    I'm also surprised that she spent so much time on this particular thing. 
    Because it's been pointed out time and time again that various Courts throughout the country including a Court from Mr. Justice Clark's own state that the matter of preemptory challenges is a manner that it is reserved exclusively for counsel on each side. 
    They don't have to assign any reason. 
    The counsel does not have to say, why he's challenging a person when he is exercising his preemptory challenge. 
    He may not as one of the justices pointed out, may not like the color of the tie of the person's wearing. 
    He may not like the color of his shirt he's wearing. 
    He may not like the color of his eyes. 
    It reminds me of a case that I was retained on back in 1936 when I first started practicing law down in Baldwin County, Alabama. 
    There was a lawyer up in Mobile by the name of Henry Aldrich who was not too well acquainted with the residence in Baldwin County. 
    And that particular case involved and a ejectment who had decided he was going to takeover a piece of land down there in the swamps up above the -- in the Tensaw River, up above Callaway and that goes over to Mobile. 
    Being a native of Baldwin County Henry Aldrich who was one of my classmates asked me if I would associate with him for the purpose of striking the jury and that was the only reason that I was hired in that particular case was to strike the jury. 
    My purpose in that case was to strike all county farmers, renters, share croppers and any other person that had no interest in owning property. 
    When we got through the strike in the jury we round up with the jury of all land owners. 
    The case was trialed for three days. 
    At the end of the trial of the case, we won the case. 
    We did not have to assign a reason why we struck any by the oath of that jury. 
    There's no reason in the world why I have to assign when I am prosecuting a case or defending a case why I'm striking a Negro or I'm striking a Mexican, why I am striking a China man or anybody else of a jury as long as I'm right exercising my preemptory challenge. 
    Now, of course when I get down to the point of striking for cause then I have to have a good reason. 
    And I think all the members of the court know that. 
    I think all the members of the court have trialed cases from time to time. 
    What -- his -- Judge Grooms was pointed out in a class action that was brought down in Birmingham two and a half years ago when it was trialed with reference to Jefferson County in particular and then later on back in October and I was in that case with regard to the (Inaudible). 
    Judge Grooms in the decision just handed down the other day on the second of December said “The number of preemptory challenges in both civil and criminal cases is fixed by statute.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1923.570" stopTime="1932.727">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Normally about 40, 30 or 40 because in a civil case you strike one for one.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1932.727" stopTime="1933.559">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    One for one --
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1933.559" stopTime="1933.647">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Right.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1933.647" stopTime="1935.599">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We had 24 men, that's the rule as I understand.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1935.599" stopTime="1936.838">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1936.838" stopTime="1948.060">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's because that's a civil, it's not very important. 
    How many do you have to have in order to strike in connection with a felony that's not a capital case.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1948.060" stopTime="1957.569">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well, they usually have maybe 40 to 50 
    There is no particular set number. 
    Now (Voice Overlap) there was a point, he was asked if --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1957.569" stopTime="1976.951">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- to get the idea, you do not have a statute to that which relates to the capital cases only which was passed for the expressed service trying to see that there's enough men there so that when you get through striking they could come as near as possible to getting a fair jury.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1976.951" stopTime="1988.364">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well now, it has been my experience with that particular thing though sometimes we ran out of a number of people, a lot of them have asked to be excused for various reasons that some of them don't believe in capital punishment. 
    Some of them are --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1988.364" stopTime="1997.344">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understand that but is there not a minimum in capital cases that you have to have, is that the statute --

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Not that I know of, no.

    No, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1999.683" stopTime="2002.787">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there is a larger number though that we have to have.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="2002.787" stopTime="2021.090">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well, what -- what normally happens in the case and it has been my experience and I've tried them in various places in Alabama is when you run down to say about 40 then the judge goes out and has the sheriff, summons people from around the courthouse and from around the business.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2021.090" stopTime="2024.616">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You do need to start with more juries in the capital case and other cases?

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Yes sir, yes sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2025.951" stopTime="2028.975">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought in your statement you started with a minimum of 100?
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="2028.975" stopTime="2046.226">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well that's what they normally summons, yes sir. 
    It starts with a 100. 
    But a lot of them come in and say we don't want to serve, we are over age, we are railroad engineers, we are conductor on trains, we are telegraph operator. 
    We are teachers, we are doctors and --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2046.226" stopTime="2048.322">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that excuses although it's --

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2048.904" stopTime="2051.549">

    And show that they come (Inaudible) the statute. 
    Is it that?
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="2051.549" stopTime="2055.501">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    And some of them are hard in hearing and so forth.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2055.501" stopTime="2063.092">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Then if it gets down below what the statutes says it has to have to get them into a strike, it is send down and get what you call (Inaudible).

    Yes, and I think it's impossible for any jury commission to go out and get every male citizen between 21 and 65 whether he is White or whether he is Negro. 
    It is impossible to do it. 
    They go out and do the best they can with the facilities that are available to them.

    Mr. Leslie Hall

    No, ask -- I didn't say that.

    And then they take those names off and put them on cards and put those cards in a box and the box is locked up. 
    Once those names are drawn out they're not used again for two more years and those names are separated from the other names that are in the jury box.

   Rebuttal of Constance Baker Motley

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Senator Motley.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="3251.112" stopTime="3294.974">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I think Mr. Justice Black if you would looked at Section 63 of the Title, I don't have it here. 
    I'm referring to the Alabama Code Title 30 Section 63. 
    I thought perhaps we had cited in our briefs somewhere but that's the statute I believe you have in mind which sets a minimum number of juries to be called in a capital case of 50 and no more than a 100. 
    It says the circuit clerk show directly share the summon at least 50 and no more than a 100 in a capital case. 
    I think if you looked at that that was the section. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3294.974" stopTime="3296.748">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- the felony was then kind of a --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="3296.748" stopTime="3408.948">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No, not just capital cases. 
    There is a separate section on felonies in general. 
    Now in this case, I think because we mentioned previously it's clear that the jury commissioners whose job was to secure names for the jury roll which was then put in the jury box relied on their acquaintances, business acquaintances and social acquaintances primarily in securing these names. 
    One jury commissioners had been pointed out and even know the percentage of Negroes in the county he estimated it at about 10% where actually it's 32%, 26% being the number of Negro males over 21, so that he had no idea of the number of Negroes in the community and then one jury commissioner on page 95 of the record he was asked, “Have you gone to any purely Negro organizations for a list of names?” 
    And he said, “No.” 
    The jury clerk who assisted the process of getting the names said she knew a couple of Negroes and this was the extent of anyone's direct testimony as to knowing any particular Negroes. 
    She said, “I asked Bob Strickland and principle may vary, they send me a list and I asked another man and he never sent it.” 
    And whenever a jury commissioner was asked to name some Negroes he put on the jury list. 
    He couldn't even do it as familiarity with Negroes was so limited.
