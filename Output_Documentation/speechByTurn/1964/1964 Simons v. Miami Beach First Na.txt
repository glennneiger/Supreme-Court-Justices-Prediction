    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a domestic relations case arising out of the question of whether or not the Florida courts are required to give full faith and credit to a New York separation decree in connection with the establishment of a widow's right to dower subsequent to the entry of an ex parte divorce decree in the Florida courts. 
    As this Court is well aware, there's no tendency for the solution to the problem of the domestic relations problems that arise in the United States. 
    And I think that each case must be taken and analyzed by reason and logic in order to reach a conclusion that's fair to all of the parties.

    Yes sir. 
    I think that the problem has arisen originally because the courts, not only the trial court, the District Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of Florida have failed to recognize the point that we attempt to assert. 
    They have in each instance decree that we were barred by reason of the fact that this point was not raised at the time the divorce suit was instituted. 
    The Florida courts have taken the position that is incumbent upon the nonresident wife to come into the State of Florida and to present this defense of res judicata or requiring the Florida Court to give full faith and credit to the New York separation decree at the time that the husband institutes the divorce proceeding. 
    And that she cannot wait until a subsequent date to make this presentation.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    My -- my problem is this Mr. Ward, and again, I -- I leave it to you that to answer in the course of your argument if you cannot right now but even if the wife had done that, then the Florida Court would have said, “Alright yes, you know you've told us about this separate -- the separate maintenance decree, and we recognized it and we ordered the husband to keep paying you.” 
    Well, in fact that's what did happened. 
    He did pay all his lifetime until his death. 
    And so, what -- what would have been gained? 
    What more -- what more could have been gained?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="215.638" stopTime="229.292">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Well, what could have been gained, Your Honor, is the rights that have been established by the New York decree that the wife is -- that this woman was to remain the wife of this man and to participate in his estate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="229.292" stopTime="241.183">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't understand that that was what that decree provided. 
    It provided separate -- a legal separation and separate maintenance alimony. 
    It didn't -- it didn't say you have to remain married to each other the rest of your lives.

speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="246.093" stopTime="311.228">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    On -- by the wife or by the husband on separate grounds, not on the grounds that were adjudicated in this particular course of action. 
    And that is the point that we -- we argue here. 
    As this Court is well aware, there is advanced distinction between a separate maintenance decree and a divorce decree. 
    There are rights that remain to the person receiving the benefit of that decree in a separation decree that do not remain after divorce decree. 
    And the basic and main right is not only the right to support but it's the right to participate in the husband's estate and to assert this dower right. 
    The inchoate right of dower remains when you grant a separation decree to a wife, she, in the eyes of the law remains the wife of that man but entitled to live separate and apart and upon his death has the right to participate in his estate by way of the inchoate right of dower attaching and become choate.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    No sir. 
    Not insofar as it affects -- it affects marital status. 
    I might point out at this point that the sole basis of the argument of the petitioner here is based upon this Court's decisions in the Estin versus Estin case and later in this Armstrong case and the Vanderbilt case, the theory of divisible divorce. 
    We do not contend here that insofar as this man was concerned, Mr. Simon, that Florida did not have a right to affect his marital status insofar as it affected society and affected his rights to -- to remarry or to live with another woman or to this -- that this decree could in anyway illegitimatize, if there is such a word, his children, if he had remarried. 
    We don't have that case here. 
    He did not remarried but I -- we do not attack the -- the marital status as established by this Court in distinguishing indivisible divorce, in distinguishing between marital status on one -- one side and on the other side the property rights of the wife. 
    The point we raise is this, is in New York with both people there, these people were married in New York. 
    They remained residents of New York. 
    They had a very hotly contested New York litigation which is shown by the decree in the record, wherein the court in New York found that the husband had been guilty of extreme cruelty towards the wife or cruelty and inhuman treatment. 
    And that therefore, she was entitled to live separate or apart from him. 
    And that she was entitled to receive support from him. 
    Now, inherent in that decree is also the proposition that she was entitled insofar as her property rights were concerned to remain his wife so that she would be entitled upon his death to assert a dower claim if he wrote her out of his will. 
    Now with --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="540.005" stopTime="547.940">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It's not the same.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    I'm saying this, Your Honor, that insofar as Florida is concerned and we're not here concerned with whether New York would have to give full faith and credit to the Florida decree at all, that was not involved. 
    What I'm saying is this, is that New York has decreed on a -- or these two people had their day in court in New York and -- and the -- the decree was rendered against the husband. 
    It was found that he was at fault and therefore the wife had the right to live separate and apart from him. 
    Now, if he subsequently goes to Florida, and under this Court's theory on the Estin cases and in those other cases. 
    He can go down there and you have said that Florida has the right because he's a domicile. 
    They have the right to -- to change his marital status, so that in the betterment of society and in the betterment of family relations that his children would be legitimate if he remarried, and that sort of thing, that Florida has the right to do that. 
    But that that would not affect the wife's or the former wife's rights who lives in another state insofar as alimony or her property rights.

    Not when she didn't appear anymore than her alimony rights were cut off, her property rights could have been determined by an ex parte proceeding.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Estin against Estin says that, if I understand it, that Florida couldn't have cut off the separate maintenance payments and that Florida could in fact was silent, the Florida Court didn't know about that New York.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Dower -- the question of dower only arises after the husband dies. 
    The -- that he has to be somebody's husband for -- for because it's only the wife who gets dower, isn't that right?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1273.130" stopTime="1297.205">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    But -- but if one court establishes in a -- in an adversary proceeding, her right to remain a wife and to assert this right in an adversary proceeding, the question is, can another court based upon the same set of facts on an ex parte proceeding take that right away from her?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1297.205" stopTime="1307.227">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand that the -- that's what because of a continuing trouble, if the New York Court had decided that she had a permanent right to remain his wife.
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1307.227" stopTime="1308.253">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    On the set of fact that was --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1308.253" stopTime="1313.269">

    That court decided was that she had a right to be separated from him and to get payments from him.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1315.154" stopTime="1333.308">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not that she had a right to remain his wife. 
    It might be a different case if he had brought a divorce and she had defended successfully then the Court would have decided the husband has no right to a divorce and as of now, you, as his wife, have a right to be married to him. 
    But that wasn't that kind of a decree.
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1333.308" stopTime="1396.022">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    It was the kind of decree that she sued for separate maintenance. 
    And he in turn defended it on a set of facts which were ruled against it. 
    And I'd say that under those circumstances, it's the same as this. 
    If Court A with both parties before him rules on a point, it set the facts as presented to point A or to Court A. 
    And Court A rules on them one way. 
    The same sets of facts were presented to Court B in an ex parte proceeding. 
    And the Court rules differently than Court A did. 
    Now, you have two judgments. 
    You have a judgment of Court A and a judgment of Court B. 
    Now, if court -- if this is presented -- and that's all that happened here was when this woman and when this woman presented her claim for dower in the Florida courts, the Florida courts was faced with this and this is the simplification of the problem. 
    They had a judgment in Court A and a judgment in Court B. 
    Now, which one do they recognize?

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    It was a decree of separate maintenance awarded to the wife decreeing that the husband had been guilty of extreme cruelty, cruel and inhuman punishment or treatment to the wife and that she was entitled to live separate and apart from him and to receive from him, I think it was $400 a month that the appellant court ult -- ultimately set as alimony or separate maintenance. 
    It's what the decree, the New York decree actually provided.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    I'm relying upon the determination by the New York Court of the issues before it, that is who was guilty of extreme cruelty to whom because the decree in the Florida Court filed by the husband was also based --

    What difference would that make on your point?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1536.452" stopTime="1582.769">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Well, it would make this different that if -- if -- that if the decree in New York had not been based upon the same ground as the Florida decree then Florida decree would not in -- in this instance, the New York decree would not been entitled to full faith and credit under the decisions of this Court and -- and most every court. 
    The only theory upon which we advance this is that the adjudication that this divorce that was granted the husband in Florida was based upon a factual situation that had already been presented to the New York Court and ruled adversely.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1582.769" stopTime="1585.706">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, are you attacking a divorce on that, do you?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1585.706" stopTime="1594.249">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    I'm attacking the divorce insofar as it's enforceability against the wife to affect her dower rights. 
    The question becomes this --

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    No sir, it would -- it would flow from it as long as they remain husband and wife.

    What if they remain husband and wife at trial?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1615.229" stopTime="1629.627">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    But as long as they are never separated for cause that's created by the wife and as long as the grounds upon which the -- the Florida decree was based, it had already been ruled upon adversely to the husband.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1629.627" stopTime="1647.101">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You're treating this just exactly as though it was a judgment made the New York Court, the litigation between the husband and wife. 
    But she claimed that he owed her a certain amount of money as I gather and to get a definite judgment for certain amount of money for certain length of time, is that it?
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1647.101" stopTime="1662.467">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    No sir, not completely. 
    My -- my -- the whole basis of the suit here is based upon the fact that the New York decree is res judicata as to the issues that were framed in the Florida divorce action.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1662.467" stopTime="1667.370">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well if that's true that would bar a divorce somewhere, couldn't it or would it? 
    And you're --
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1667.370" stopTime="1744.034">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Yes sir. 
    It would bar a divorce on those grounds. 
    Now, the question arises, when must the wife assert this New York decree in order to preserve her rights to participate in the husband's estate, the dower? 
    Obviously, in this case, if she's represented it, we assume that if she's represented it at the time that the husband filed a suit for divorce in Florida and the Florida courts had -- had recognized it and -- and said, “Yes, the New York decree is res judicata on the issues of extreme cruelty.” 
    Then in that instance, the husband's divorce would have been denied and she would have remained obviously as his wife and been entitled upon his death to participate in his estate as dower.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    They went on the premise that it was too late for this woman to plead this New York decree to -- to -- to assert her rights. 
    That's what they did. 
    They said that -- that this -- that now, that -- that her only occasion to protect her rights, her dower rights, her only occasion to assert that right and protect that right was when this husband, after leaving the State of New York and going to the State of Florida, and instituting a divorce suit in Florida by which he searched her constructively that she is required to then sojourn herself to Florida which is a foreign jurisdiction to her completely, never having resided there that she must then go to Florida and defend herself. 
    And if she doesn't, she's forever barred and this New York decree means nothing. 
    So therefore, the husband, by reason of this sojourning around the United States can obtain an advantage over the wife on a matter that's already been litigated in New York.

    Now, that's the distinction. 
    But once you concede that the husband acquired a domicile and that the Florida Court has jurisdiction in a divorce action where a party has domicile over the action, if it has jurisdiction over the status of the marriage, then the substitute service is permissible.
speaker="robert_c_ward" startTime="1960.450" stopTime="2085.518">
    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Insofar as it -- as it affects marital status. 
    But this Court has ruled that -- that that doesn't require the wife to appear and assert her alimony rights or right to support, her right to maintenance or property rights under Pennoyer versus Neff. 
    And that's -- that's my distinction. 
    I'm merely asking the Court to follow the same distinction that they followed in these other cases. 
    That this is a property right and it is a vested property right by the New York decree if the Florida decree is based upon the same facts. 
    And we must analyze this case from the facts in the record, not as a broad general principle but as the facts are presented here on whether or not this decree is entitled to the full faith and credit. 
    It forms -- it comes down to this. 
    When must this woman -- when is this woman required to assert this New York decree in order to protect her rights to participate in her husband's estate. 
    If you say that she must sojourn herself around the United States and follow this husband and that -- and in order to protect her rights, then I have no standing. 
    If you say as you did in the -- as I interpret the Estin cases and the Armstrong case, and the Vanderbilt case, if you say no that there is such a thing as divisible divorce, that -- that the husband can get a divorce insofar that it affects his social obligations but it does not affect the wife's property rights, then my client has preserved this right to assert this New York decree insofar as asserting her dower rights. 
    And that seems logical because dower in of itself is in -- inchoate. 
    She would have no right to sue in any court or sue him in Florida as long as he was alive. 
    Her rights to dower only arise and become choate and become enforceable if she survives this man.

   Argument of Marion E. Sibley
speaker="marion_e_sibley" startTime="2243.435" stopTime="2244.592">
    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    Mr. Chief Justice --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Sibley.
speaker="marion_e_sibley" startTime="2246.900" stopTime="2336.245">
    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, I have with me, my partner, Mr. Irwin Levenson of the Florida Bar. 
    This case is one that has puzzled me, since he has -- since the certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    I have had difficulty in understanding what the problem was and how to face it. 
    It has now been conceded as it must be that if the State of Florida had jurisdiction of a divorce proceeding because the plaintiff in that case was domiciled in Florida and Florida had jurisdiction of the status of marriage in that proceeding. 
    It has been admitted that the petitioner here received procedural due process. 
    She received the summons in New York or the notice in New York. 
    She received the complaint in the courts of New York as provided strictly by the statutes for substituted service in Florida. 
    She took those to her attorney in New York, in fact there were two attorneys, and was advised not to contest the divorce proceedings because New York did not recognize.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2336.245" stopTime="2337.863">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What kind of service, would you mind repeating?
speaker="marion_e_sibley" startTime="2337.863" stopTime="2355.179">
    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    Substituted service, bad publication but the complaint was forwarded to those required by our statute. 
    And a notice to appear was forwarded which she admits she received and which she took her attorney in New York who advised her not to appear in the Florida proceedings.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2355.179" stopTime="2363.670">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    She also did advise not hear what he said and she admit that the husband have to ignore her and he told her it was appearing.
speaker="marion_e_sibley" startTime="2363.670" stopTime="2372.281">
    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    That is true. 
    But it must be recognized that on the evidence and the overpowering evidence, the lower court decided that was untrue.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2372.281" stopTime="2373.033">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    He didn't believe it?
speaker="marion_e_sibley" startTime="2373.033" stopTime="2503.011">
    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    He didn't believe and I think he would justify it in so doing and that I believe is a fact that he must assume exist in this case. 
    Now, that was not unusual advice for the New York attorney to give, I don't think because I have given the same advice to my clients. 
    If I had a fairly good -- an award of alimony in the separate maintenance proceeding, and the husband takes himself to Nevada as has -- it happened in my practice. 
    I have often advised under the Estin case or under the Armstrong case, and under the Vanderbilt case not to appear in the Nevada proceedings in order that the wife might continue in Florida to receive the benefit of the decree she has there obtained for money. 
    I have never been so bold as to suggest that the divorce in Nevada was not good or she would have some residual rights to dower notwithstanding in fact that the divorce was good and she was not the widow of the man upon his death. 
    Having conceded the authority and power and the jurisdictional power where the Florida Court over the status of the parties, the divorce in Florida of course is binding upon the parties insofar as the dissolution of the status is concerned. 
    Now, we must concede that prior to the filing of the divorce in Florida, the lady had filed a suit for separate maintenance in New York and had been successful in procuring an award of $440 a month and I think that was a final award made. 
    It must be conceded that that judgment was honored throughout the life of the dissident. 
    So full faith and credit was extended to that judgment in that every quarter was paid under and it's conceded by counsel and that is true.

    You did not however -- full faith and credit was not given to (Inaudible) indication of the New York Court and out of that, the wife has justified living separate and apart from each other because the (Inaudible) which is the same type of conduct in which the New York Court held that the wife is (Inaudible)

    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    In all candor, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would have to concede on that very parts -- small segment of the record in New York that that grounds were closely alive. 
    It is impossible for me to say and I think it's impossible for the Supreme Court of the United -- of the United States to say that it was res judicata because we do not have the pleadings nor the issues, nor the testimony, we have only a segment of a judge's order and then we cannot tell whether that actually follows the pleadings and what the actual issue was. 
    But I would say from what that judge said in that very small segment of the record, there's an indication with the grounds were closely alike if not the same.

    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    Not in the slightest, Your Honor pleases, not in the slightest. 
    When the Florida Court had jurisdiction of the cause and gave her notice, procedural due process and she determined, as I have pointed out before, that in order to save her judgment in New York, she would not go to Florida and present her defenses if she had any including the defense of res judicata. 
    While then, she waved her right 10 years later after her husband was dead to come back into Florida and say, “Oh, I had a defense to that lawsuit but I have followed the counsel's advice at that time and didn't make my defense. 
    Pardon me, let him make it now.”

    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    The right to reexamine the question of residence was preserved to another court. 
    That of course was preserved to the Florida Court as well and a reexamination of that issue was made in this case and overwhelmingly established by the record that he was a resident at the time that he filed this divorce proceeding and remained a resident for nine-and-a-half years later and died a resident of Florida.

    Well we say first, no decree. 
    It just said it in the statute. 
    It said that in the state the state has an interest in the marriage of people. 
    It has an interest that seeing that the wife has not left him pecunious on the public and our law therefore recognizes that she's entitled to have her husband support her whether he lives here or lives somewhere else.

    The Estin case actually, although it started off on the theory that they were given full faith and credit to a New York separate maintenance provision. 
    Estin case actually as finally modified by the Armstrong case and the Vanderbilt case said that it was not under the full faith and credit to us at all. 
    It was because they could not put out intangible personal rights by substituted service in the state where the divorce was granted, as I understand it.

    Yes sir.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If dower rights are property rights, would the fact that the decree in divorce case said that there are no property rights to be determined in this case and none were determined have any significance at all in the case?

    Mr. Marion E. Sibley 
    And none or whatever because a dower is an unusual and inchoate property right that has no vested, actually no vested right in the wife, only a provision that it becomes effective in the event she survives her husband. 
    There's no such thing as dower while the husband lives. 
    And there's no way dower can arise until the husband dies still married to the woman that claims dower. 
    Do I make myself clear?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, I -- I understand that but also I suppose in -- or I'll ask you the question I don't know.

    No sir that is an existing right but that depended upon some future event or surviving some future event. 
    That right persists with and after the divorce. 
    That is the -- that is the common law right of the wife to be supported by her husband. 
    That's an existing right though you referred to as an intangible right, it is a right that presently exists. 
    I'll come back to the problem that they suggested. 
    The question is, far having granted a good divorce, one that's recognized as valid, that having dissolved the status is there a federal question involved if the former wife comes to Florida and seeks in a Florida Court dower in Florida property. 
    I see nothing that has anything to do with the federal law there. 
    That seems to be a question for Florida's jurisdiction. 
    They have a right to decide what effect of their divorce decree was on dower as allowed by statute in Florida. 
    And that's the whole question involved here. 
    And as I started out with, Your Honor, I started out with -- with the complexity as to why this case is here. 
    I still have it complex here. 
    I must say that I came here quite and full with argument and to make one of those real -- I think telling speeches and the Court so well understood the problem that I had very little to say as if I answered the questions.

    Mr. Robert C. Ward 
    Alright, I will eliminate it from you, sir, any further. 
    But this Court has said many times in all kinds of cases and particularly in these -- this type of case that everybody is entitled to their day in Court. 
    And that the basic philosophy of this whole thing of the wife's rights not being wiped out by ex parte proceedings was solely that she wouldn't become a public charge. 
    Now, what I'm saying here and what I am asking this Court to do is not to allow a -- somebody come in 10 years later and present a defense, they may have had in litigation. 
    I don't think that the Court would have the right to do that, any court would.I think that basic premise has been established. 
    What I'd say is that when the parties have had their day in Court and they have fully litigated an issue that one of the parties should not be entitled to run to another jurisdiction and in an ex parte proceeding which is another effect of fraud upon the Florida Court in this case wipe out this woman's rights.

    On the New York case. 
    And wiped out this woman's rights and then say when she comes in to assert her rights, under this decree that she got when both she and her husband had their day in Court, they say on a procedural technicality, well it's too late to present that now. 
    You should have presented it years ago. 
    I'd say that's not only not granting full faith and credit to the New York decree, that's depriving this woman of her equal protection under the law and due process. 
    They litigated this matter. 
    They litigated it together. 
    They had the day in Court and for him to go off now in another jurisdiction on an ex parte proceedings and wiped out her rights, I say cannot be done under the federal constitution. 
    And that's why I say that this New York decree should be granted full faith and credit. 
    The Florida Court should be required to say, “Yes, that issue was litigated, did New York decree is res judicata and she is entitled to enforce this property right because marital status has nothing to do with it now because the man is dead. 
    She's enforcing this property right in his estate. 
    And I believe that it should be enforced else she's been deprived of her constitutional rights.
