    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 360, A. M. Harman, Jr., et al., Appellants, versus Lars Forssenius et al. 
    Mr. Carter, you may proceed and continue with your argument.
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="16.321" stopTime="496.312">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    On yesterday prior to the recess, the issues in this case had been stated and the statement of facts had been substantially completed. 
    I had just apprised the Court of the facts concerning a special session of the General Assembly of Virginia held in November of 1963 which enacted certain revisions of the election laws so as to make them workable in the practice with the total tax requirement for registration and voting inoperative in federal elections as required by the Twenty-fourth Amendment but operative in state and local elections. 
    The only one of these statutory revisions that was held invalid by the court below and the only one which is the subject of this appeal is Section 24-17. 2 to which I referred yesterday which establishes two optional methods by which a registered voter in years subsequent to the year in which he registered must prove his revenues as a qualification for voting. 
    The Twenty-fourth Amendment having been formally ratified in January of 1964, the statutes involved here became effective by their terms on February 19, 1964. 
    Two declaratory judgment actions and these cases were instituted by the appellees on the very next day, February 20, 1964. 
    And the order of the court below was entered on May the 29th. 
    A stay was refused by this Court in June of 1964 and consequently the final order of the Court went into effect on July 1 of last year. 
    When you look at the opinion of the court below in this case, you will see that in the very first sentence, that court concluded that the statute involved here created a new and additional substantive qualification for voting in Virginia. 
    A qualification which the Court said was demanded of federal voters only and not of state voters. 
    Thus, the reason of the Court, this qualification is invalid under Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
    This initial conclusion at the very start of the opinion is the cornerstone of the entire reasoning of the court below. 
    And we believed that it is plainly and fundamentally erroneous. 
    It's quite clear we believe that Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment contemplate that the people of the states must first establish qualifications for voting in their state constitutions. 
    Which qualifications are then adopted by those two sections of the United States Constitution and are thereby made qualifications for voting in federal and congressional elections as well. 
    This Court and numerous other authorities have repeatedly observed that it is the people of the state who first fixed or established the qualifications for voting that apply in federal and state elections. 
    Now going back into history, all of the states in this nation at one time or another have had qualifications based on qualifications for voting, based on age, or residents, or sex, or race, or property ownership, payment of taxes, literacy, and other similar qualifications. 
    But of course the power to fix or establish these qualifications as vested in the people of the states by Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment has now been expressly and specifically limited by the Fifteenth, the Nineteenth, and the Twenty-fourth Amendments. 
    Those amendments are couched in very similar language and in the same basic form although the last one, the Twenty-fourth Amendment, is the only one that applies to specified federal elections only. 
    The other two apply to all elections held in the United States. 
    Now each of these amendments rendered inoperative a particular type of qualification for voting that many states had theretofore had in their own constitutions. 
    But none we submit has fundamentally altered the basic plan whereby it is the people of the states who first fixed the qualifications for voting and those qualifications are then adapted by the Constitution of the United States. 
    The power to fix or established voting qualifications has also been limited at least to the extent of procedural and implementation statutes by the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    But subject only to the limitations of these four amendments to which I have referred, the people of the states have the power to initiate voting qualifications. 
    Now, it is important to remember that the state courts very early in our history proclaimed the fundamental constitutional nature of voting qualifications. 
    And the Supreme Court of Virginia like the highest courts of most of our states has adopted the rule that substantive qualifications for voting must originate in the Constitution of Virginia and cannot be created or rescinded by mere legislative enactments of our general assembly. 
    This rule has been enunciated in three different Virginia cases which are cited on page 13 of our opening brief. 
    So, if the statute involved here Section 24-17.2 created a qualification as the court below reasoned then this statute would be invalid under the Constitution of Virginia. 
    We believe and we argued to the court below that this was basically a question of state law as to whether or not such a qualification was created. 
    And it was on that basis that we moved for abstention in this case, feeling that surely in the area of voting qualifications there was one field left where the federal courts might properly divert it to the state courts. 
    But of course this motion was overruled by the court below. 
    Turning now to the Constitution --

    That is quite correct Your Honor. 
    Turning now to Sections 18 and 20 of the Constitution of Virginia, we see that poll tax payment has been a qualification for registrative -- for registration and voting in Virginia for many years.

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, in the early history of this country most of the 13 original states, all but two I believe out of the qualification for voting property ownership --

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    That it were important?
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="717.124" stopTime="735.540">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Well, as I understand it, the theory was at that time that property ownership did give a man an attachment to the community and an interest in the affairs of the community that he otherwise would not have had.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="735.540" stopTime="743.119">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    You just have it squared or do you (Inaudible) would not be a qualification required on voters?
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="743.119" stopTime="772.657">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    I don't believe that this Court has ever decided that a property qualification would be unconstitutional. 
    Now, it's interesting to note that in some of the original Senate Resolutions which were the forerunners of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, you had a prohibition against property qualifications and poll taxes. 
    But when the final resolution was adopted by the Congress, the property qualification was left out and the amendment was limited to the poll tax.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="772.657" stopTime="786.111">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="786.111" stopTime="878.695">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Yes sir, I am. 
    My theory has been that that case does not involve voting qualifications in the constitutional sense that we are discussing here today. 
    And in no case to my knowledge have you had a situation where the people of the state have purported to adopt the qualification of that kind in their own constitutions. 
    Now, as I pointed out yesterday because of the system of permanent registration in Virginia, the payment of the poll tax has had a very practical significance in the working of the election machinery. 
    It actually was the means by which the various voting lists were kept up to date. 
    And thus, it had a dual function in practice. 
    It was a constitutional qualification. 
    And in addition to that, it was a means of proving continuing residence and residence of course is a separate qualification under our Constitution. 
    Therefore, it is easy to see that in order to give effect of the Twenty-fourth Amendment in federal elections and simultaneously retain the poll tax in the state elections, some method was necessary to keep these registration lists up to date. 
    And the method that the General Assembly of Virginia chose was the statute which is before this Court today.

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Now, as our court has held subsequent to that time, actually it was in the case of Butler versus Thompson passing on the validity of the poll tax itself in which the opinion was affirmed by this Court. 
    It was there stated that the quotation from those particular delegates to the constitutional convention had no significance at this time. 
    What was an issue in that case of court was the basic constitutional validity of the poll tax and it was upheld as a qualification for voting claim. 
    Now, returning to the opinion of the court below, it seems to us that the basic reasoning behind its holding was that the court felt that payment of the poll tax was just not a trustworthy means of proving residence. 
    And as a practical matter it boiled down to that so far as the Court is concerned. 
    Now, it's our contention that this conclusion was unsupported in the record. 
    There's not a bit of evidence in this case to contradict the legislative history of the statute before the Court today. 
    And that legislative history has to the effect that in practice the poll tax has been used to prove residence. 
    Moreover, there are any number of cases, many of which are cited in our brief that hold -- that in situations where you must determine residence or domicile the voluntary payment of poll taxes and other personal taxes assessed in the locality is the best possible test of residents that you can have in those situations.

    The practice in most by our local jurisdictions, Mr. Justice White, is that the personal property tax return, the tangible personal property returns contained insu -- contain information sufficient for the assessment of the poll tax.

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    The statutes passed by the General Assembly in 1963 provide that the State Board of Elections must print out forms of these certificates and distribute those forms to the various local voting registration authorities. 
    The statute does not go on to say what those authorities will do with it and presumably there maybe differences in practice, some may distribute them widely or keep them in their offices for use. 
    I can't tell but I should point out, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that the statute clearly says that you must file a certificate substantially in this form not in any particular form, substantially in this form.

speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="1767.716" stopTime="1827.549">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    The General Assembly in this case and the judgment of the appellants simply acted on the basis of practical experience in Virginia and stated what it felt as a matter of legislative power constituted evidence of residence, residence being the qualification for voting with which we are concerned here. 
    Now, it is not up to us in this case. 
    We believe to show any more than that. 
    This was not a clearly irrational and arbitrary action by the legislative body. 
    Surely, it had to file to act on the basis of practical experience to set up an evidentiary requirement in the voting area just as it may set up evidentiary requirements in other areas of the law. 
    I will move on now to the second issue in the case --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1827.549" stopTime="1844.528">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean that's true even though it would slow down the voting rights of a man that reaches it to some extent, do you think that's within the power of the legislature under the Twenty-fourth Amendment?
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="1844.528" stopTime="1873.195">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    If the statute in this case was as we deemed it to be, simply our requirement for proof of residence then I would not feel that whether or not it slows down voting as any constitutional significance because all qualifications of voting whatever their nature must have this effect of slowing down voting in that sense.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1873.195" stopTime="1887.468">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But do you think the legislature can prescribe a number of tests of -- for voting that are different among different groups?
speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="1887.468" stopTime="1951.170">
    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    If the classification were reasonable under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which we will argue in a few moments, then I believe that a state could, yes sir. 
    Completing very quickly the opening argument for the appellants, may I say that the second issue in the case is whether the order of the Court should've been extended to elections for president and vice president on the basis of Article I, Section 2 in the Seventeenth Amendment. 
    Those two sections of the constitution apply only at the congressional elections. 
    And if you look at Article II, Section 1 and the Twelfth Amendment which deal with elections for president and vice presidents, it is clear that the states are left to determine how the electors for those federal officers will be selected. 
    And there is no adopting provision which brings them back as qualifications for voting under the constitution or anything of that sort.

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    So as the brief for the United States concedes in this case, it was improper for the court below to have extended its order to presidential elections in this way.

    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We don't want to be taken as conceding that if the United States has conceded we don't want to be taken as conceding if this -- or the court was improper concerning the presidential electors. 
    I don't think the United States has conceded it either but if the court think so we don't want to be a party to the concession. 
    The -- I think I might start out with the question asked by Justice Black about this extremist business. 
    This is what Senator Glass said in the convention, discrimination, well that is exactly what we proposed, exactly what this convention was elected for, to discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of federal constitution. 
    But the fact is, that Senator Glass was not --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2025.477" stopTime="2028.439">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What he is -- what he's saying out -- about the poll tax?
speaker="h_e_widener_jr" startTime="2028.439" stopTime="2415.084">
    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    No sir, he was talking about the purpose of the suffrage provisions in our constitution of 1902. 
    But the fact is that Senator Glass was not the extreme -- didn't represent the extreme view in that convention. 
    He represented the middle between the Eastern and Western Virginia. 
    Many people in the convention from Western Virginia probably most of them were against any poll tax at all. 
    The people from Eastern Virginia by and large Eastern Blue Ridge Mountains were far more stringent restrictions on voting than this constitution provided. 
    And the statement was made by Senator Glass that the constitutional convention would discriminate but only to the extent which was permissible under the federal constitution. 
    And I think a reading of the debates makes that quite clear that he was the person of the convention who got to people together. 
    The poll tax was put in that convention purely and simply as a qualification for voting. 
    There was no -- there's no mention in the debates the convention was fully reported and the reports are widespread, I guess almost every laws of Virginia has one. 
    There was no mention with the debates anywhere at all of poll tax being any kind of a proof of residence. 
    The constitutional convention established four qualifications for voting; age, residence, registration, and poll tax. 
    It was residence and poll tax, not residence or poll tax. 
    The Attorney General, when the legislature met the special session to pass this legislation stated that the right of the state to fix qualifications for voting is not changed in any other respect. 
    The Attorney General stated again, this appears in 80 -- pages 84 and 86 of the record, state voters will automatically qualify to vote in federal elections but federal voters will not automatically qualify to vote in state elections. 
    So what this special session met for and passed were concerned qualifications for voting granted that the statute itself after he get started goes off on what is called evidence of residence now. 
    It wasn't called hat then. 
    In the preambles of the statute itself at page 92 of the record, it's a bill to authorize persons in anticipation of ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the constitution of the United States to file certificates of continuing residence so as to be able to vote if otherwise qualified. 
    At the very outset of all of these legislations, the legislature has stated that in filing this certificate is a qualification for voting. 
    The argument that it was a proof of residence came later in the statute. 
    Apparently the General Assembly must have been worried about the classification or establishing different qualifications for voters from the House of Delegates and for Congress and the Senate. 
    But in any event, that's what they called it in the statute. 
    The Governor in his address to the General Assembly, stated that the -- they were not fooling around with the qualifications for voting but that they were only legislating with regard to proof of residence. 
    And the Governor laid it back to the constitutional convention. 
    He said accordingly and out of the genius of that body of men originated our present system whereby it is presumed that any person assessed for the computation tax and thereby allege to be a resident of Virginia who comes forward and voluntarily pays the assessments six months prior to a general election shall be presumed to be a resident of Virginia and shall be deemed to have satisfied those provisions of the constitution which restrict voting to residents. 
    But that isn't what the constitutional convention debate said. 
    There was no mention in it -- of it. 
    There just wasn't any mention in the debates of such a thing. 
    I like to invite the attention of the court to the defendant's Exhibit Number 32 which is a compilation of Virginia election laws put out by the state and in the back of the exhibit are the laws passed to the special sessions. 
    Now the laws in the balance of the book, the principal part of the book, have not changed it substantially since 1902. 
    These were the laws which were brought about by our constitutional convention of 1902. 
    It's true that absent voting and voting by members of the armed services on a different way have been added since then but there's been no substantial change. 
    There isn't a mention in the principal part of this book up until the fall of 1963 of the payment of the poll tax being evidence of anything, residence, or otherwise. 
    The payment of it was put in there simply to restrict the electorate. 
    If it wasn't, why are three-years payment of poll tax required to prove one year's residence? 
    Why is payment of 1963 tax required to vote in 1964? 
    The 1963 poll tax for example is assessed on January the 1st, 1963. 
    It is payable on this -- until December the 5th, 1963 without a penalty. 
    I think that time there's a penalty in interest charge on it. 
    But if you pay it up until May of 1964, you can vote in the general election which takes place in November 1964. 
    But how does the payment of the poll tax in May prove that you're a resident in November? 
    Or out of the payment for poll tax for 1963, supposed you paid on time, proves that you're going to be a resident of Virginia at all for 1964?

    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    -- poll watchers at the polls. 
    Each candidate has poll watchers at the counting and any qualified voter can challenge another person when he offers to vote. 
    When you come in Virginia and ask for a ballot or say my name is Smith, am I on the list? 
    That is an offer to vote in Virginia. 
    And at that time he can be challenged. 
    The -- both the majority party and the minority party are represented at the polls. 
    The people who got the majority in the last general state election have the majority of two judges. 
    The minority party has one judge. 
    I don't know about the practice for clerks of election in other places. 
    In my hometown we have one clerk and they have one clerk. 
    So that this -- as far as I know, there's adequate safeguards at the polls for challenging people. 
    If you -- a challenge comes out at the polls for a voter there's a note which the judges of election must administer to the voter and perhaps this answers to Justice White's question to some extent. 
    There's an oath which the judges of election administer to the voter before he is allowed to vote. 
    If Smith comes up and says, "I want my ballot" and the -- one of the judges says, "I challenged Smith on the grounds he's a nonresident", the challenge sticks at that time until there's a long statutory oath and they are also allowed to examine him.

    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    Well, I would then complain that they didn't send it to everyone on the registration books. 
    There was a question asked a few minutes ago about how is it mailed out. 
    They mailed it out to the people who paid the personal property tax the year before. 
    This certificates though if -- if a state were to adopt that system ought to be mailed to all of the voters not to all of the taxpayers. 
    The fact that whether a man who owns the personal property tax list or not has nothing to do with whether he is a voter or not.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, isn't this a -- isn't this really an additional argument that really the certificate requirement reaches people that the poll tax requirement never reached. 
    The state sends bills to the -- only seeks the poll tax, rather that the poll tax would be paid people who paid personal property taxes?
speaker="h_e_widener_jr" startTime="2825.601" stopTime="2863.018">
    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    Yes sir, that's true. 
    Then you must go down and get this certificate of residence, have it witnessed or notarized, say that you will not leave the state until the election. 
    None of those things the poll taxpayer has to do in addition to the actual filing of the certificate. 
    The poll tax payments, the dollar and a half was mentioned, that isn't nearly important as to the fact that you have to pay it for three years. 
    The $5 could make a difference to some voters. 
    The fact that it must be paid in May to vote in November is the thing that makes the big difference about the poll tax.

    You then are supposed to go and check the list yourself to see if you're on it.

    That if we get into the degree of requirements that is allowed or what is allowed is -- how much is allowed to form -- we will end up with these cases as a matter of fact. 
    For example, they're required two witnesses if they can require two, can't -- they require ten. 
    We don't think there's any use to get to the argument of whether this requirement is reasonable or unreasonable, we say they don't have any right to do it.

    Well, now how do you get it to presidential elections through Article I, Section 2 if it was Seventeenth Amendment?

    Mr. H. E. Widener, Jr. 
    Alright sir, the-- as I understand it, at least our court has said in Willis against Commack (ph), its page 43, it's Judge Keith. 
    He says, “The object to the Fourteenth Amendment was to secure the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the U.S., representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of the state or the members of the legislature thereof.” 
    And I think that the Fourteenth Amendment would have application to this right because this is not an exclusively state right establishing qualifications for voting. 
    The state's brief has argued at great length that the establishment of qualification is the -- in exclusive right of the state. 
    On page 8 of the brief, their opening brief, they state that the states have the exclusive power to create qualifications for voting in all elections and that word exclusive or words of similar import are used a great number of times throughout their brief. 
    The -- we don't believe that the history of the voting legislation in general bears that out.

    We say that that the classification itself is not warranted. 
    That they cannot legislate with regard to that that they just -- they just can't do it. 
    It's not the question of whether it's a reasonable or unreasonable that they have no right to put people in that class. 
    Then they have gone on and in addition to that, the District Court has pointed out in its opinion in great length the differences between people who pay poll tax and filed a certificate of it and that -- about paying the poll tax or filing a certificate is a burden on the federal elector which is not required of the state elector. 
    And I don't think that we're entitled to measure the degree of the burden. 
    If there's any burden on this federal elector or does not require for the state elector, we maintain its violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    We submit that the Virginia laws are invalid under the Twenty-fourth Amendment itself. 
    The Twenty-fourth Amendment provides the right to vote in certain federal elections, shall not be denied or abridged upon the kind of failure to pay poll tax. 
    We believe there was an abridgement here because the legislation imposes a burden on persons who have not paid the poll tax solely because they have not paid the poll tax, because that burden is an unnecessary and unreasonable burden and because it is precisely a burden of the type which was meant to be reached by the Twenty-fourth Amendment.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3989.265" stopTime="3998.723">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let's see. 
    Is it your position that this is nothing for the device to do the same thing that the outlawed poll tax did?
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="3998.723" stopTime="4037.205">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Not precisely. 
    If it were -- if -- to argue that would only be a device to reach the same result as the poll tax, you might have to go into purpose or motive and I don't think it's necessary in this case to do that. 
    It has a bearing. 
    The fact that the type of device that's attached to this procedure is similar to the cumbersomeness in the type of rejections that were made to the poll tax, has a bearing on the results on whether this is or is not an abridgement but standing by itself. 
    I don't -- we do not argue that that alone is -- would be sufficient or would cause for the invalidity of --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4037.205" stopTime="4043.144">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I would think you have to get pretty close to that argument so to make it violative of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, isn't it?

    Your point is as I under -- he -- tell me if I understand it correctly that the Twenty-fourth Amendment confer the right upon all voters in federal elections to vote without any impairment of the poll tax.

speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="4067.847" stopTime="4108.484">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    That is correct. 
    Now, we say further that if -- it'd be assumed that Virginia argues that they must -- they need to do that and we are willing to concede or assume for purpose of this case that if a case of absolute necessity were made out by the state that there's no other way in which they can achieve the legitimate governmental objective, namely the checking on residence.

    In the same way here under the Twenty-fourth Amendment where a requirement, a burden is placed on the person solely because he avails himself on his right under the Twenty-fourth Amendment, not to pay a poll tax that would be a burden in the three-judge court in the equivalent Mississippi case, Gray against Johnson held just that.

    First of all, it must be filed in every election in connection with every election it's not from that type of thing. 
    It must be filed within the specified time between October first of the year proceeding the election and six months before the election with -- would work out in May of the year of the election. 
    Apparently as I read the record, if the certificate is received subsequent to May, it will not be considered at all, the registrar would simply -- the treasurer will simply give it no validity whatever.

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Well, we of course challenged that the state's premises in this regard are correct. 
    We don't believe that the poll tax ever was a -- an evidentiary requirement or that it has ever been used in that manner. 
    And I might say on this issue at least insofar as the Twenty-fourth Amendment is concerned, the state has a very heavy burden because they are putting a burden on the exercise of the Twenty-fourth Amendment right and they have the job of justifying that this is a reasonable burden and they can -- if they cannot justify it this is a reasonable burden unless they can show that the poll tax in fact and as a matter of legislative intent was a residence requirement which I think it was not. 
    The constitution of Virginia list of paying a poll tax in residence is two entirely separate qualifications and not one is a proof of the other. 
    So far as we have been able to determine (Inaudible) -- and the state has not pointed out differently. 
    Until November of 1963 no one has ever dreamed that the poll tax was a requirement, was a proof of residence, it was always something else. 
    It was an -- means of raising revenue or as the Supreme Court of Virginia has pointed out, it was a means of restricting the electorate to those persons who are sufficiently interested in governmental affairs to pay their poll tax at an early time. 
    Now in fact, it does not -- the poll tax does not really prove residence. 
    It -- the check on residence might be necessary with respect to two classes basically, the persons who are coming into the state for the first time and people who have been within the state, have registered, have voted, and that since moved out and would still like to vote again. 
    As to the first class, people who have never been then tried to vote. 
    The real proof of residence, the real check on residence is the registration requirements because that's the first thing you have to do. 
    This legislation recognizes that registration is the real check on residence as to those people because you do not have to obtain the certificate in the year in which you register. 
    So that when a person comes in, he -- the state knows that he is a resident by virtue of the fact that he registered permanently at that time and he can be examined at that time as to his residence.

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Black, the state could do the same thing if the other 44 states that have permanent registration are doing and it is doing what the other 44 states are doing, to check on residents. 
    They have a challenged provision at the polls. 
    They have provisions for purging those who are no longer residents. 
    They have criminal penalties for persons who vote not withstanding the fact that they are not residents. 
    And those are all the means and devices which other states, the other -- or the other 44 states have found to be sufficient to deal with the problem of nonresidents and none of these states has found it necessary to add in addition to this complicated, cumbersome, peculiar residence certificate requirement. 
    So that's -- that is quite --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4912.727" stopTime="4921.655">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What your claiming as I understand it is the right to utilize the method which they say was utilized for that purpose before, saying that since he doesn't now have to pay a poll tax. 
    They want to transfer and substitute for -- requirement that they required for registration with the requirement now for him to vote.
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="4949.599" stopTime="4979.182">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    That's right. 
    And the -- as I say the answer is number one, the premise that the poll tax was used for that isn't true. 
    The second answer is that they have sufficient devices now to deal with problem of voting by nonresidents. 
    And therefore this peculiar requirement which is in the area of the devices to be dealt with by the Twenty-fourth Amendment is wholly unnecessary and can really have no other purpose except to perpetuate the difficulties inherent in the poll tax.

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    If the Court please, first of all let me point out one misquotation which was made by counsel for the appellees and I'm sure unintentionally in the heat of the questioning he said in showing how unreasonable the certificate was that it had to be verified by two witnesses. 
    On page 10 of the record in Subparagraph B of this Section before you, it says it would be notarized or witnessed by at least one adult. 
    So one witness only is required. 
    Now, as to the equal protection argument that's been made here, I challenge anyone to look at the statute in question and tell that it classified federal voters and state voters in terms it speaks of every person, any person. 
    So it does not make the classification. 
    Now we did say in our reply brief that even conceding that it made a classification of federal voters, that classification would be invalid under the rule of Pope versus Williams, a Maryland case which was cited and relied on very heavily by this Court only yesterday in the case of Carrington versus Rash. 
    And we believe that under the language of both of those cases, this particular provision of Virginia Code would be valid as a classification even if it did -- even if it were limited to federal voters only which is not --

    Now, in answer to the contention made by the Government, the questions of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice White got right at the heart of their contention because if you read their brief, you will see that what they are saying is that anything which is burdensome, onerous, harsh, oppressive, and which would force you to pay the poll tax would be invalid under the Twenty-fourth Amendment. 
    We would concede that if it had the effect of forcing you to pay the poll tax and was so unreasonable and so arbitrary that it did that then it would be invalid under that amendment but here --

    I see you have to go a little further than that if it has that calculated tendency (Inaudible)?

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    Even conceding that, Your Honor, we believe that it is not true in this case that the requirement is reasonable and not at all burdensome. 
    Now pushing the Government's argument to its fullest extent, let us supposed that Virginia did a way with the poll tax and in place of it adopted an annual registration system which many states have. 
    And let's say that they declared in making that constitutional amendment that they were doing it as a substitute for the poll tax. 
    Now would that be invalid? 
    We contend that it clearly would not be and that the Government's argument falls apart completely and when it's viewed in that light. 
    In conclusion, I would like to say just a word about the abridgement argument which was brought up here. 
    It's our contention that if you look at the legislative history of this particular amendment, you will see that it was a specific and pinpointed as any amendment to this constitution has ever been. 
    Senator Harlan introduced the resolution in about five sessions of Congress and he spoke at -- on it at every bar association and other meeting he held during that period of time. 
    And he said repeatedly that the only objective was to do a way with the price on the vote. 
    And that he did not intend his resolution to upset the state election machinery anymore than that. 
    So we contend that the word abridged in this context and with this legislative history means to deprive or to cut off or to curtail by doing something else that is so harsh and so oppressive that it has the tendency to make people pay the poll tax and thereby violates the amendment. 
    In no --

    Are there any -- excuse me -- are there any figures that will show that -- how many of those who voted in federal -- the last federal elections have filed the affidavit and the state should know (Inaudible)?

    Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr. 
    If Your Honor please I should have gotten to that at the outset because I believe the Court has been mislead in this respect in trying to answer these questions. 
    All of us have speculated as if this law had been in effect for sometime and then we did have some practical experience under it. 
    Truth of the matter is that it was in effect for only two months. 
    It was declared invalid before you had any real experience and it was not in effect in any elections during 1964. 
    We believe that the Government's argument on the Twenty-fourth Amendment is so broad that its -- averts the intent of the framers of that amendment and constitutes an undue interference with the power of the states over voting qualifications.
