    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Thank you, sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I appreciate the indulgence ago for letting me argue this case pro hac vice and I hope you're not ashamed of it or you ordered before you get food, before I get the food. 
    As I see this case, there are two issues under the facts that I'm about to recite. 
    Can a state create a transitory cause of action and so restrict it that only the state that created it can enforce this cause of action? 
    The answer -- the obvious answer to this is, no. 
    However, this no is qualified by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution which is the next issue and, as I see it, the only issue that this Court has to decide. 
    Did the Alabama Court, in enforcing the Georgia statute, violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution? 
    Petitioner was awarded a judgment in a trial court in Alabama and the said judgment was based on the Georgia Workman's Compensation Law. 
    This was a default judgment. 
    No appeal was taken from this judgment. 
    This was in February of 1959. 
    We filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the respondent here who was the insurance carrier of the defendant in the Alabama trial court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="128.967" stopTime="134.437">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, before you did that, didn't you try to sue on your judgment in the Alabama Circuit Court?
speaker="max_c_pope" startTime="134.437" stopTime="139.523">
    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Yes, sir. 
    I was not associated in this case until there was -- until I filed the complaint in the federal court.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    It was -- right sir. 
    It was filed in the Court. 
    That is not in the record here, but we might as well bring it all out that it was not -- it's not in the record before the Court. 
    It is in the respondent's brief, but -- that this -- we are -- I'm willing to discuss that aspect of it. 
    But there was a bill filed in the Court. 
    It was taken a nonsuit and we filed the bill -- the bill in the Federal District Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="164.705" stopTime="175.206">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And as the -- the Circuit Court, in your suit on the judgment, upheld the defendant's affirmative defense instruction.
speaker="max_c_pope" startTime="175.206" stopTime="175.499">
    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    That's the way I understand it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="175.499" stopTime="177.308">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They gave the merits to those rights.
speaker="max_c_pope" startTime="177.308" stopTime="309.810">
    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Right, sir. 
    Their motion to dismiss was filed in the Federal Court. 
    This motion was granted. 
    We appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    They affirmed the trial court. 
    We filed a petition for certiorari and it was granted in May of 1964. 
    As I understand the Alaska Packers case, which is this Court's decision, there was a conflict between the Alaska Compensation Act and the Compensation Act of California. 
    The petitioner or the plaintiff was injured in Alaska and this Court held that in so awarding in California compensation even though he was injured and was covered by Alaska compensation, they held in that case that the Compensation Acts of either jurisdiction, consistently with due process, could be applied in either state. 
    Then a later case, Pacific Employers versus Industrial Accident Commission was also involved, the California Industrial Commission, which also would involve the Massachusetts Compensation Act. 
    And they reiterated that principle and it said either state would be free to enforce and adopt the remedy provided by the statute of the other state. 
    Now, in this ca -- this Court's, one of their more recent decisions is the Carroll versus Lanza case in 1954. 
    And in any of this opinion, the Court said the Pacific Employers Insurance case teaches the corollary form which would be Alabama in my case, can displace the entire Foreign Compensation Act or they could supplement it. 
    They can supplement it. 
    In that case, in the Carroll versus Lanza case, the plaintiff was injured in Arkansas. 
    He was employed in Arkansas. 
    He was granted benefits under the Missouri Compensation Act. 
    Then, he filed a common law action in Arkansas and this Court held that it was permissive for the Arkansas to disregard the entire Compensation Act of Missouri and give him his common law or common law remedy in Arkansas. 
    It did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution for Arkansas to displace the entire Compensation Act.

    Yes, sir, but the fact that the Court of a sister state does not have jurisdiction of its own cause of action. 
    This Court held in TCI versus George which involved the Alabama versus Georgia Court decision that they reversed, Alabama had a provision that this could only be enforced in Alabama. 
    And this Court held that the statutes of a sister state, jurisdiction is not determined by the law of the Court, it's determined by the law of the Court's creation and cannot be defeated by the exterritorial operation of a statute of a sister state even though that statute created the cause of action. 
    If it cannot defeat the jurisdiction, this provision, this administrative procedure or procedural right, and under the Georgia law, cannot defeat the jurisdiction of the Alabama Court.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    That this -- this Court in my opinion, in the Carroll versus Lanza case it so said that, sir, when it said that it could disregard the entire Compensation Act or it could supplement it and I don't know what the word “supplement” mean, but I would assume that it would mean add something to it, and I think it add no more than a way to enforce -- enforce this cause of action. 
    In my case, and also in the Carroll versus Lanza case, it said Missouri-- talking about Missouri which would be out, it said it could make its Compensation Act exclusive in its own courts and enforce it as it sh -- as it was -- as it please, but when this right was extended to other states, different considerations come into play.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Yes. 
    Well, and insofar as stated, it indicates that nowhere that this man -- in this case, the defendant withdrew from this case and the plaintiff was put on a horns of dilemma. 
    He did not know what to do. 
    The Court -- this is not in the record, but this is the aspects of the case. 
    There are certain other parts noted who put on the horns of dilemma of what to do. 
    They came up with the insurance policy that only provided for insurance. 
    This -- this is the essence of it. 
    It only provided for insurance under the State of Georgia. 
    If this man had an Alabama judgment based on Alabama law, it wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on it. 
    This is it. 
    This Court held in Alaska Packers case that the -- this was not a workmen's compensation case was not a tort action. 
    It was -- it was an incident of doing business. 
    There was a promise that they would -- that their employer would compensate a man when he was injured and the statute -- the states, in passing these statutes merely sanctioned this problem. 
    And it's the instant of doing business and it comes out of the realms a little bit of the regular conflict of laws and each state has it's -- that is one of the things I think the Carroll versus Lanza case turns on. 
    As I said, it says different consideration or different -- as this Court has expressed in the very recent case of Clay versus Sun Insurance Company that the significant context that the Court's other form has a governmental interest that they have a right to protect. 
    In this case, the petitioner was injured in Alabama. 
    The defendant was doing business in the State of Alabama. 
    And the State of Alabama has an interest in protecting injured employees that are injured within its boundaries.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    This is a transitory cause of action. 
    Sir, as I understand, a transitory cause of action, it is a cause of action that can happen any place. 
    A local action would be one like trespass the land. 
    It could only happen where a person want to cross that land. 
    This person could be injured in Alaska and his cause of action would occur. 
    There is a transitory cause of action that could occur any place that he was covered under the Georgia law, and this is the reason I say this is a transitory cause of action. 
    This is one of the bad aspects of this thing. 
    True enough, this is only a neighboring state of Alabama and Georgia right next door, but if this employer had taken this man to Alaska and he had become bedridden and injured up there, would he be forced to go all the way back and exhaust his administrative remedy all the way back to Georgia? 
    I don't think the decision of this Court takes it that far, and that's the result we'll reach if this -- if the Court of Appeals is not reversed in this thing. 
    It's the application it has to the whole thing is preventing a state -- a foreign state to protect its citizens that are injured within its boundaries.

    The only thing in the opposite trial court was sustained with pleas and demurrers and what the judge used as basis of it, I do not know.

   Rebuttal of R. Foster Etheredge
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1036.089" stopTime="1037.813">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Etheredge.
speaker="r_foster_etheredge" startTime="1037.813" stopTime="1176.633">
    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I must confess to you, this case has been troublesome to me because there are certain guidelines here that I think that the petitioner has tried to mesh over into an old long line of cases. 
    For example, I am surprised that my brother quotes TCI against George in support of the petitioner's contention because TCI against George recognizes that Alabama could not limit what appeared to be an employer's liability, wrongful death statute. 
    The enforcement of it in the other state, this Court recognized the age-old principle that there are many cases where the right and remedy are so united that the right cannot be enforced except in the manner and there before the tribunal designated by the Act. 
    But, the rule is well settled that where the provision for the liability is coupled with a provision for the special remedy, that remedy, that alone must be employed. 
    That's an age-old case. 
    It's never been disturbed. 
    On page 19 of the brief I cite to you some 10 or 12 states which have carried this statement or principle allowed the full effect. 
    The Tenth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, and may I say in regard to the Circuit Court ruling on demurrer, in this same situation, this same facts, that in the case of Singleton against Hope, an Alabama Supreme Court decision, it stated and answered this proposition insofar as Alabama's choice of conflict of law rule is concerned. 
    In Singleton against Hope, the Alabama Supreme Court refused to follow the Georgia law and said that the remedy, under the Georgia Compensation Law, is proper pleading and proof before the Industrial Commission of our sister state of Georgia. 
    Now, may I state this to you, if you reverse this case, you'd be holding that an Alabama trial court must administer the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Law. 
    There's no authority for this proposition.

    The Full Faith and Credit Clause --

    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    Well, I think so, yes, sir. 
    I think that's the argument. 
    However, in a practical administration of justice, all I'm saying is that if you say that this judgment is valid in a Circuit Court in Jefferson County or the DeKalb County Circuit Court in Alabama, then you're saying that those Courts can hear cases under the Indus -- under the Workmen's Compensation Law of the State of Georgia. 
    And, I -- and in the respondent's position is that that is incorrect also. 
    Now, Alabama can adopt or -- on the Full Faith and Credit, I think, Alabama has a right to say that the sister state has this statute, has set up procedural ways in which it's to be enforced and we're going to recognize those procedural ways, and Alabama has done that.

    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    Yes, sir, and I'm attempting to -- I mean, that's what we are relying on but, in an answer to that, I'm trying to suggest to you what that Court has said in some of the basis for its reasoning. 
    Maybe, as you say, it is not necessary for me to do that, but the Circuit Court of Jefferson County refused to -- held this by, in effect, by its ruling on demurrer that this judgment was void and that the Court didn't have jurisdiction.

    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    If the judgment is valid, if the Court has jurisdiction, it would be valid, yes. 
    But I'm suggesting to the Court that the cause of this decision of the Circuit Court is bottom down Singleton against Hope that the Court didn't have jurisdiction of the subject matter, therefore, it is void and subject to collateral attack.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1665.309" stopTime="1667.135">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You'd have to go to the subject matter jurisdiction.
speaker="r_foster_etheredge" startTime="1667.135" stopTime="2064.471">
    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    Yes, sir. 
    It is a subject matter. 
    Now, may I state to the Court, my brother cites three cases, Alaska, Pacific Employers, and Carroll against Lanza. 
    Those cases are not applicable here because that was the question of whether the state of the forum could apply its own compensation law where a defense of the home state was asserted against it. 
    In each of those three cases, as I suggested, they're not really germane to the issue in this case. 
    Now, may I call your attention to one or two items which I think have particular pertinence here. 
    On page 9 of the brief of the respo -- of petitioner-appellant's brief, he's fallen into grave error because, on that section, he quotes from context these words, “Either state would be free to adopt and enforce the remedy provided by the statute of the other state,” but what -- now, what are the full words of the text from this Court's decision against -- in Pacific Employers. 
    While in -- here's the quote, “While in the circumstances now presented, either state, if its system for administering workmen's compensation permit, would be free to adopt and enforce the remedy provided by the statute of the other state.” 
    You see, he left out the all important eight words in this case, “If its system for administering workmen's compensation permit,” and this is precisely, I think, what this case at bar is all about. 
    We shall say more about this Pacific Employers case later. 
    Now, here's what's bothered me. 
    For one thing, this question about Pearson, and he relies to a certain extent on Pearson, where the -- where we've got a result now in the State of New York, for example, where the law is applied to an airplane. 
    As you recall, it's different from the law of -- as were applied to an automobile in the question of limitation of damages and a wrongful death. 
    I haven't resolve that yet in my own mind except of the interstate flavor in that case. 
    But what he has done is adopt a case as it present it to you on the question of this place of tort business and where you try to subs -- differentiate where the forum applied its substantive law and applies its own procedural law. 
    I'm just suggesting to you that these cases are really not opposite in this case. 
    But also in the Alaska Packers case, petitioner quotes from the Alaska Packers case the Compensation Acts of either jurisdiction may consistently, with due process, be applied in either state, but here's what the Court said in the Alaska Packers case. 
    It should be pointing out this, “We assume, as did the state court, that the remedy provided in the Alaska statute is one which could also be applied by the California courts.” 
    So, that you just made an assumption in this opinion that California would apply, for example, or could apply the Alaska statute, whereas, perhaps not. 
    Now, when the petitioner went into the Circuit Court of the DeKalb County, he first sued on an Alabama count under the Alabama Compensation Law, and then he struck it. 
    But Alabama could have entertained jurisdiction and given this petitioner an award under the Alabama Compensation Law under the cases of the holdings of this Court. 
    For example, the Court has held, this was in Alaska Packers, that the place of injury the forum state could apply its own statute even though the home state statute is asserted as a defense to it. 
    If this petitioner had stayed under the Geor -- Alabama law, of course he could have recovered a judgment in amount of se -- $11,200 which would have been more than the judgment that he obtained under the Georgia law of $10,000. 
    Now, I don't know anything about this business of Zurich Insurance and all of that.That's not in the record. 
    I do say this to you, that this trial court in the DeKalb County, Alabama gave a lump sum award of $10,000, then he awarded an attorney's fee of 33.30% or $3,500 which he didn't have a right to do either under the Georgia statute or Alabama statute because the Alabama statute limits it to 15% and the State Board in Georgia sets the attorney's fees in the cases litigated or tried under the Georgia Act. 
    And another thing, under Alabama law, he didn't even have the right to make a lump sum award unless both parties agreed to it, and that is the same -- that's -- the same thing is true under the Georgia statute. 
    Now, in Pacific Employers case that I alluded to a while ago, this Court specifically in language said that, while the circumstances now presented -- well, let me say this. 
    It is difficult to understand why the petitioner rely so heavily on the Pacific Employers liability case in his brief because in recognizing the rule of law which controls this case at bar, here's what this Court said in the Pacific Employers case, “Full Faith and Credit would deny to California the right to apply its own remedy and its administrative machinery,” well, let me get that, “Full Faith and Credit would deny to California the right to apply its own remedy and its administrative machinery may well not be adopted to give him the remedy afforded by Massachusetts.” 
    Similarly, now similarly, the Full Faith and Credit demanded for the California Act would deny to Massachusetts the rights to apply its own remedy and its Department of Industrial Accidents may well be without statutory authority to afford the remedy provided by the California statute. 
    So this Court has recognized this. 
    This case, in essence, in that posture has been before you before.

    We administer our statute for the courts. 
    We'll recognize and give jurisdiction, assume jurisdiction, and we'll give you relief. 
    But they also held in this case, in J.A. Jones Construction Company, at the suit of Green, the Fifth Circuit has already decided this case. 
    The Fifth Circuit, in the case of Green versus J.A. Jones Construction Company, said that Mississippi would not have jurisdiction of a claim under the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Law, in Fresquez against Farnsworth, and the Tenth Circuit has held the same thing. 
    He asked you the res -- the petitioner to align the Fifth Circuit Court case of Green versus J.A. Jones with Alaska Packers, Pacific Employers, and the other case, Carroll against Lanza.

    And I've come a long way about it, if I may, if my time permits, in Kilberg -- now, in Kilberg, which is a de -- well, Pearson and Kilberg got on an airplane in New York, went to Massachusetts and had an accident. 
    Kilberg beat Pearson to the state court and got a judgment in the State Court of New York. 
    The Court of Appeals said, “Well, we're going to recognize the Massachusetts' wrongful death statute and we are going to apply -- we are going to refuse to apply the limitation of damages.” 
    It's contained and made a part of the Wrongful Death Statute of Massachusetts. 
    Now, they had for years said in automobile cases, in Lux against Standard Oil of New Jersey, that we -- we will adhere or apply the Massachusetts limitation of damage, in spite of the fact that New York Constitution of 1894 prohibited by constitutional enactment that the State of New York could not impose a limitation on damages.” 
    Now, there came Pearson, died in that same accident, he went to the state court -- I mean he went to the U.S. District Court. 
    Judge Kaufman, as you recall, wrote the decision. 
    You've read -- you've refused certiorari in that case, and he said the business of this dichotomy of what is substantive and procedures got no place here because this has got an interstate flavor. 
    New York is so wrapped up in this thing that we've got our own rights to protect. 
    And what I'm suggesting to you in this case, Mr. Justice Black, is, on your question, that Alabama could say and this Court could upheld or uphold Alabama that Georgia's policy is obnoxious stuffs and we're not going to follow it.

    What I'm trying to say though is, of course the judgments before us. 
    The DeKalb County Circuit judge took the paper and it wanted a judgment and awarded 33.30% fee and so forth, as I've remarked in the judgments there. 
    But it came for a studied effect, not on default, before the circuit judge in the Court of Jefferson County and he said that Court in the Dekalb County didn't have jurisdiction because Alabama has already decided the case in Singleton against Hope. 
    I keep coming back to that.

    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    On the Board's judgment of jurisdiction, yes, sir. 
    Where the Court doesn't have the jurisdiction of the subject matter, it's void and I can start out in the Justices of Peace Court and go all the way through up to you -- a bit up to this Court and you can then, on your own motion, say that the Court or justice below did not have jurisdiction and throw the case out. 
    The pitch is made on page 25 of the petitioner's brief that Alabama has a duty to prevent its citizens from coming to public charge and not Georgia, but the thing about that is Alabama could apply its Alabama compensation statute to this case because the injury occurred in Alabama and there's no point in coming over to cross the line and applying the law of Georgia when this petitioner could have recovered a judgment for $11,200, $1,200 more than he got under this void judgment or wanted to get under the judgment of the DeKalb County Circuit Court.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, I wonder, Mr. Etheredge when an Alabama Court says “Well, we could give you a recovery, the injury happened here, under our Workmen's Compensation Act, under our common law rule but now, we'll pick something else out. 
    We'll give you recovery under the Massachusetts law, the Georgia law, or something else.” 
    Are they really giving a recovery under Georgia law or are they giving a recovery under Alabama law?

    Mr. R. Foster Etheredge 
    Well, I think that they're giving recovery under the Georgia law that they just recognized that they'll implement or give operation to that cause of action created under that law. 
    I don't think they're substituting their own rule making power of the Court for the statute of the sister state.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are you familiar with the principle for example if we apply in the national law cases.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think one of the most distinguishing characters in this question that's been raised is Singleton versus Hope Engineering Company, our words, as I say, it was a default judgment. 
    The law in Alabama, and it says as I quote from the Kilberg versus Southern Auto Insurance Company, said it's almost universally held that where there is no proof of the law of another state, it will be presumed that the law of the forum in which the issue is being tried is the law of the state on the question involved. 
    In our case, there was no proof of this administrative procedure of the Georgia law. 
    In the Singleton versus Hope Engineering Company, there was a demurrer filed to a common law action alleging the Georgia law in Alabama courts, contrary to the federal courts, federal courts take judicial notice of all the states law.Of course, one -- I heard one judge say that he may take judicial notice of it. 
    He'd like to have his recollection refreshed. 
    However, in this case, there was no pleading of the Georgia statute as a defense or any provisions of it as a defense to deprive the Alabama Court of any type of jurisdiction in this case.

    Well, that's it, but what I'm trying to say is the answer to the Singleton versus Hope Insur -- Engineering Company that there was no alleged Georgia law as a defense to this cause of action and it was presumed, as some of the Justices have said that they took and as the Pearson case also said, that New York took the corpus of the Massachusetts law and adopted it as its own law. 
    This is what -- this is what in the essence it did in that case. 
    And also in the Pearson case, in an answer to this argument about the remedy, and all of this stuff is so inseparable that it cannot be separated, the Court in the Pearson case said we are directed to no precedent and are unaware of any compelling logic in the defending a precedent which requires a state to enforce such a statutory qualification whenever it chooses to enforce a foreign cause of action.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Yes, sir. 
    Yes sir. 
    I -- in this case, the Georgia statute says, where a person is totally disabled and the judgment recites that he was totally disable, they have a compensation where he can be awarded a lump sum of $10,000. 
    And in this case, he was awarded a lump sum judgment. 
    I cannot see where the respondent has been injured in this matter. 
    The judgment was rendered. 
    They did not appeal. 
    They did not raise these jurisdictional matters in the Court, and the Alabama Court does not take judicial notice of its sister state statute and they can only be proven as set out in the Alabama statute. 
    Now, my brother raises the TCI versus George case. 
    The dictum, and it says where the right and remedy are so inseparable, and this rule came from the Pollard versus Bailey case which arose. 
    It was not a diversity case. 
    It was a diversity case in the Federal District Court in Mobile, Alabama. 
    In that case, there was involved the stockholder's liability to the bank's creditors and it all depended on the interpretation of the charter of the bank. 
    And in this case, this was before in the federal courts that the law and equity were merged and in that case, this was a law action and this Court said that the stockholders were liable a pro rata share of their stock as to the amount of debts. 
    And they said there was only one of them before the Court. 
    It had to be in equity where they could all be enjoined and they -- be joined in accounting and there could be an accountant to determine the pro rata share, and this is where that rule arose. 
    Now, in any of the other cases, they cite this rule in the TCI versus George case but it does not follow. 
    It cites it as a proposition. 
    It's only dictum, and this other case is not in context with. 
    And the Pearson case is just -- the opinion in that case is so well written and Judge Kaufman says in that case, he was referring to the Alaska Packers case, he said the Court, talking about the Supreme Court, expressly recognize that rights asserted under the statute of one state may be necessarily denied or qualified by the law of another state. 
    Now, the law in Alabama is, when you're injured, when you're entitled to compensation, that the way to enforce it is in the Circuit Courts in Alabama. 
    And this is what the Alabama Court did. 
    They used the old rule that the forum state uses its own procedure and uses the substantive law of the forum state. 
    Now, Judge Kaufman said he did not pay any attention to this legal tort, that it was the result to speak the loudest to him that the person was entitled to their money and there was no -- no policy reasons or the Court of the forum not to give it to him. 
    Now, Mr. -- the Carroll versus Lanza case, in this case, this Court, when it handed down this opinion, they said, true enough, this is not -- the facts are not just exactly alike but, they said, “For we write not only for this case and this day alone, but for this type of case.” 
    And in this case, this is the same type case as the Carroll versus Lanza case and here, the only difference and we as -- trying to get affirmative relief and not raising it in -- the petitioner -- the respondent has not raised it as a defense. 
    And I just can't see how the words in the Carroll versus Lanza case does not authorize the Alabama Courts even though that the matter had been raised as a proper defense, which I say it was not, even though it had been raised, the Carroll versus Lanza case authorizes the Alabama Court to ignore, if they can displace the entire queries of land to be drawn.

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    It in -- it indicates that, except the one fact there was a common law action in this. 
    Now, I would agree that the language in the case Singleton versus Hope does advance that proposition, but the facts are not the same. 
    If the facts were the same, I would say that would be the law but it is not. 
    The facts are different. 
    It's a common law action.

    I --

    Mr. Max C. Pope 
    Well, I see your logic behind it. 
    However, I think the Singleton versus Hope case is more important with the Carroll versus Lanza case and it was a 1931 case which is a good time beyond that, but it was a common law action in both cases. 
    In Alabama, they decided to recognize the exclusive effect of the Georgia statute in the Singleton versus Hope case, which they did not in the Carroll versus Lanza case and I think the Alabama Court did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause by not applying the Georgia provision of the Georgia statute. 
    And mainly, that's the only issue for this Court to determine.
