Abernathy v. Alabama

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Abernathy et al., versus Alabama. 
    Mr. Hall you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="11.316" stopTime="256.896">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    As was pointed out by Mr. Pollak in his opening statement yesterday, each of these petitioners was convicted in Alabama for unlawful assembly and all of them were convicted for breach of the peace except the petitioner Wyatt T. Walker. 
    Now, Mr. Pollak is outlined a good many of the facts existing in these cases which were combined for the purpose of trial and for the purpose of argument before this Court. 
    I would like to add to what he said, a few things that we think that should be pointed out. 
    First, in the Spring of 1961 a wave of civil rights demonstrations known as freedom ride swept through the south and it swept through Georgia and Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana among other states. 
    And using their own words in the support in their brief here, their purpose was to demonstrate to the country that Negro travelers very often did not enjoy equal rights secured by the law, that statement is taken from page 4 of the petitioner's brief. 
    Now, in this particular case, I think it is well to point out that this particular freedom ride was started out by a group of white men. 
    They consisted of Professor Coffin, Professor Maguire, Professor Gaylord Noyce and -- who were joined on that original jaunt through the south by one David E Swift, he was the only Negro who started out on this trip. 
    When they got down into the Carolina, they were joined by two other Negro theological students at Atlanta and then proceeded on into Alabama. 
    When they reached Montgomery, Alabama on a Greyhound Bus, they were greeted by a crowd of some 2,000 people who were very hostile to them. 
    Now, as pointed out by Mr. Pollak yesterday, they are had been two, I believe or maybe three other freedom rides that had preceded at this particular freedom ride and each of these freedom rides had been accompanied by some measure of violence on the part of hostile crowds. 
    By the time this particular group arrived in Montgomery, the National Guard, the Alabama National Guard had been called out by the Governor, then Governor Patterson, for the purpose of attempting to maintain law and order within State of Alabama, especially in the City of Montgomery where most of this trouble had been taking place. 
    Some 1400 National Guardsmen were on duty besides the highway patrol and members of the Sheriff's force and local city police. 
    However, the whole situation was under the direction of the National Guard, under the direction of General Graham and of course he had his subordinate officers under him.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well, in any of that, going back to the arrival of this group in Montgomery where they were met by Reverends Abernathy, Shuttlesworth and Wyatt T. Walker, all colored ministers. 
    This crowd of 2,000, very hostile people met them at the Greyhound Station and there were bricks thrown and stones thrown and it was a very intense and dangerous situation. 
    They proceeded to the home of Reverend Abernathy and spent the night. 
    They were contacted by General Graham, who asked them to advise him when and if they wanted to travel. 
    The next day, they advised General Graham that they wanted to travel on to Jackson, Mississippi and they intended to go by Trailways bus. 
    General Graham furnished the military escort for them to the Trailways station. 
    When they arrived at the Trailways station, there was a large crowd that people gathered across the street, estimated variously of 400 to 500 people. 
    There were approximately a 100 National Guardsmen stationed in front of the station and there were members of the National Guard inside the station as well as the Sheriff of Montgomery County and possibly other law enforcement officers. 
    When the seven who were actually intending to travel in interstate commerce arrived in the station together with the other four, the seven proceeded to the ticket vendor and bought tickets for Jackson, Mississippi. 
    Then they went over to the lunch counter and sat down and ordered coffee. 
    When that happened, according to the Colonel Porch who testified in the case, there was a large hue and cry that went up across the street. 
    The -- Colonel Porch, being in charge of the National Guard detail there, became fearful because of the tense and electric situation that a riot might take place. 
    He then ordered the Sheriff of Montgomery County to arrest each one these of parties. 
    The arrest took place and they were carried to jail, tried, convicted and sentenced.

    Well, outside the station, 400 to 500 people. 
    Now, I'm not going to argue that these people who are travelers in interstate commerce did not have the right to be served at this counter. 
    The crux of my argument is that under the existing circumstances, they invite the possibility of a riot. 
    They actually insight it what could have turn into a serious riot. 
    They actually were not bona fide interstate travelers in the first place.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    What they had done, they had given themselves a great deal of the advance publicity about what they intended to do. 
    And then, in fact, they called the press conference that morning at which newspaper reporters were present, radio announcers were present, television cameras were present, and they made a very particular effort to let it be known, why they were there? 
    Well, it just goes back to the fact that there had been some rides previously in the last -- within the previous week and they were met by a hostile crowd, they're still the hostile crowds there and under all of those circumstances, they did everything to agitate a very bad intense situation.

    No Sir, they didn't. 
    They didn't arrest any of the people in the crowd that met them at the Greyhound Station who threw the brick blocks and stones the day before. 
    In fact, I think on the Sunday night before the arrival of this group, there was a tremendous riot outside of Reverend Abernathy's church in which a car was overturned and burned, and the police and the state troopers had a terrific job, while trying to control the crowd. 
    It was a thing that had been going on for approximately a week. 
    And the National Guard had just very morning of this event escorted another group of freedom riders over to the Mississippi line. 
    It wasn't any difficult but when this group followed on the heals of the other two groups that come through there, General Graham and General Porch just felt that the things were getting too far out of hand and something had to be done there and that was the reason.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    There are about four principal matters which I would like very briefly to cover in the, I believe it six minutes remaining to me. 
    I think the Court had the feeling of -- for the central facts which led up to these arrests. 
    I think at this point it becomes really decisive to contrast these arrests with two other events. 
    First, the non-arrests of the three men whom Colonel Porch described as the three white toughs, whom he said where they're to create trouble, who poured coffee on the counter stools just before these petitioners sat down. 
    It would be my inference, although there is certainly nothing in the record to demonstrate it, but the three white toughs must have poured coffee on those counter stools because they anticipated that petitioners would sit down. 
    At all events, those men were not arrested. 
    Now, the second item with which the treatment of these petitioner should be contrasted is that the day before as General Hall has just indicted, the -- one of the first groups of freedom riders, to leave from Montgomery for Jackson had left from that very terminal, the Trailways Bus Terminal had come in just as this group had to that terminal under military custody into the White Waiting Room and had bought tickets and had sat down at that launch counter, that same launch counter as a racially mixed group and there had been no incident and there had been no arrests. 
    Although, troops who were in control and there was a crowd of some 250 to 300 people outside the terminal. 
    Why the differential in treatment, we cannot know for sure? 
    We do know that on the previous day, neither Sheriff Butler nor Colonel Porch nor General Graham, no one of those three officers was at the White Waiting Room. 
    But on the day of these arrests, all three were there and there was a difference in result. 
    Now, General Hall has said that on the Thursday the day of these arrests. 
    There were as many as 500 outside the terminal and only a hundred troops in attendance. 
    There is testimony to that effect. 
    Colonel Porch's testimony was that the crowd outside was only 300, just as the day before there had been about 250 to 300 outside the terminal. 
    General Graham said that the troops he had disposed around the terminal on the day of the arrest of this petitioners, he said he had several hundred, several hundred general, “Yes, several hundred”. 
    Now, I think General Hall said that General Graham and Colonel Porch who just come to the conclusion of things had gone too far. 
    The arrest warrant on which these petitioners were tried in the Court of Common Pleas, quoted at the page 8 of our brief, as the Court will note Sheriff Butler's arrest warrant charges and I refer to the Italicized wording in the middle of an arrest warrant, “They did willfully and intentionally attempt to test segregation laws and customs.” 
    That was the contemporaneous statement that morning. 
    As to why an arrest was sought. 
    When Sheriff Butler was examined as to what he meant by that, I refer to page 106 of the record. 
    Sheriff Butler was asked in the middle of the page, “As the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this county sir, can you tell us what particular laws you had in mind if any?” 
    And Sheriff Butler testifying in November of 1961, six months after this event said, “I don't know what particular code it would be, but I'm sure a lawyer, speaking to Mr. Gray. 
    I am sure lawyer that you know our lunch stand, Cafes and other places are segregated.”

    The interesting thing is, that of course Sheriff Butler, though he swore out the arrest warrants, he didn't himself praise the arrest warrants. 
    He testified who did praise the arrest warrants. 
    On page 107 of the record, Sheriff Butler recalls, “My recollection is that the warrants were awarded by Judge Marks,” judge Marks was the Court of Common Pleas judge who was to try these petitioners were worded by Judge Marks with the assistance of our Solicitor and the lawyer from Athens, Alabama, Colonel Porch, who is in service of that time. 
    So, this was apparently the view that Colonel Porch and the county Solicitor at the time and Judge Marks said, as to what the arrests were about. 
    Now of course, the trial in the Circuit Court, the de novo trial in the Circuit Court, the convictions that are under review here was on a Solicitor complaint departed in wording slightly from the original arrest warrant. 
    That Solicitor's complaint is list is -- is set forth on page 9. 
    And this time, the Solicitor charged that the petitioner did willfully and intentionally seek or attempt to seek service at a public lunch counter with a racially mixed group, were no longer told about an attempt to test segregation laws. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may I beg an additional couple of minutes.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Just of a couple of minutes because there's one point that's Boynton, I want to get to. 
    I would say only that the departure -- the Solicitor's departure from the original arrest warrant cannot change the decisive nature of this case. 
    And the decisive of nature of this case, if this Court please, I think is made absolutely plain by -- if the record itself did not demonstrated by the decision of a Federal Judge who was already examined, almost exactly this record. 
    This case is peculiar. 
    I know of no other in this Court's prudence which presents the situation. 
    This Court in cases like Edwards and Finner and all the rest that you had, is in the very difficult situation of having to review the determinations of Lower Court Judges, State Judges, and the determinations of a police acting at the time. 
    But in this one instance, you have the comfort not merely that one of the members of the Alabama Court of Appeals dissented from the -- of judgment of affirmance, but that before the State Court trials either of them before the Court of Common Pleas or the Circuit Court tried these petitioners, petitioners went into Judge Johnson's Court in the middle district of Alabama and sought an injunction against these prosecutions on the grounds that they were for the purpose of perpetuating segregation. 
    Judge Johnson dismissed on the grounds of Section 2283 of Title 28 for the Federal Judicial Code, precluded his enjoining a State Court prosecution and he dismissed, but he did not dismiss until he had taken two days of testimony, testimony which is almost reproduces the testimony General Hall and I have discussed. 
    On pages 14 and 15 of this record, if the Court please, you will find Judge Johnson's evaluation of this record. 
    I want you to understand about Judge Johnson that the Court does not find or believe that the arrest of these individuals against to whom these criminal proceedings are now pending was for any purpose other than to enforce segregation. 
    As a matter of fact, in this posture of the case, the Court is of the opinion the arrest of those individuals was for the purpose of enforcing segregation in these facilities. 
    Judge Johnson dismissed the motion for an injunction against the County Solicitor, because he felt that the restraints of the Federal Judicial Code left him powerless, even though, he knew that these were unconstitutional prosecutions. 
    Section 2283 imports restraints, a dimension vital to our federal system and it assumed, Judge Johnson must have assumed these federal rights would be vindicated by the State Judiciary. 
    What was the response of the State Court, Judge Carter said on page 117 on this record --
