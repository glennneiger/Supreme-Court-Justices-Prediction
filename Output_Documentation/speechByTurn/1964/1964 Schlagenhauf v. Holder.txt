Schlagenhauf v. Holder

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 8, Robert L. Schlagenhauf, Petitioner, versus Cale J. Holder, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Indiana. 
    Mr. Smith, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="robert_s_smith" startTime="36.289" stopTime="360.273">
    Mr. Robert S. Smith 
    If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I am here pinch-heading for Mr. Wilbert McInerney of the Washington Bar whose name is on the schedule. 
    We were in Mr. McInerney's office at nine o'clock this morning calling a cab and he got word that his wife had died. 
    He of course left immediately for the hospital. 
    I'm pinch-heading for him and I trust I can cover the ground. 
    This case arose in Indiana as a result of an automobile accident, I shouldn't say automobile, involving a Greyhound bus being driven by the petitioner here, Robert Schlagenhauf and a tractor trailer, the tractor being owned by the -- one of the respon -- not a respondent, one of the parties Contract Carriers, the trailer being owned by National Lead Comp -- Corporation. 
    It was being driven by McCorkhill. 
    That accident happened on July 13th, 1962 on Highway 40, some miles west of Indianapolis. 
    Shortly thereafter, personal injury litigation was filed, as a mater of fact four days or after, and asking for very substantial amounts of money from all of the parties I have named. 
    In November of 1962, the plaintiffs, Markowitz being her name, filed an amended complaint. 
    And in that amended complaint, no mention was made of the physical or mental condition of the petitioner Schlagenhauf. 
    Greyhound filed an amended cross-claim asking that General Motors be made a third party defendant asking judgment on its cross-claim against Contract Carriers, National Lead and General Motors. 
    Contract then filed its answer to the cross-claim of Greyhound. 
    Again, no mention was ever made of Schlagenhauf's physical or mental condition. 
    Later, in a letter to the District Court, Contract Carriers alleged specific acts of negligence on the part of Greyhound saying the defendant the Greyhound Corporation carelessly and negligently employed and caused its driver Robert L. Schlagenhauf to operate the said bus upon a public highway although he said Robert L. Schlagenhauf was not mentally or physically capable of operating the said bus upon a public highway at the time and place when said accident occurred, which fact was known or should have been known to the Greyhound Corporation. 
    The whole question involved in this case is an interpretation of Rule 35, the Rule permitting physical exam and mental examination of a party. 
    Rule 35 of course provides in an action in which the -- the mental or physical condition of a party is in controversy, the Court in which the action is pending may order him to submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician. 
    The order maybe made only on motion for good cause show and upon noticed -- upon notice to the party to be examined and to all other parties and shall specify the time, place, matter of conditions and scope of the examination, and the person or persons by whom it is to be made. 
    About this time in the proceedings, a petition was filed in the District Court by Contract Carriers asking that Schlagenhauf submit to physical and mental examinations. 
    Now it has to be remembered that Schlagenhauf is the unwilling dependent driver of the Greyhound bus. 
    I believe both Mr. Kightlinger and I can agree that there has never been an interpretation of the rule as it applies to an unwilling defendant as of this Court before.

    Mr. Robert S. Smith 
    No, I -- you didn't say that Your Honor. 
    I can -- I can readily see where there should be an examination of a defendant under certain circumstances. 
    For instance, suppose an individual buys a policy of life insurance and falsifies the application by saying that he has not had certain diseases and the company learns that he does have them and that they may prove fatal very shortly. 
    That company certainly is entitled to file an action, a declaratory judgment action for cancellation of that policy and if that man, the defendant in that case places the issue in controversy by denying that he had those conditions then I believe the court should and would order a physical examination of the individual but the respondent here or the petitioner pardon me, was never given any opportunity too put this issue in controversy as is required by Rule 35. 
    The Court was presented with a petition asking that he'd be examined by four doctors based simply on the statement of a lawyer that Schlagenhauf had had a similar accident in the past, it doesn't say how far in the past. 
    That is the only cause shown and the Court signed an order ordering Schlagenhauf to submit to examination by nine physicians the same day the petition was submitted. 
    Neither Schlagenhauf nor we knew anything about this petition until the petition and the order signed by the Court was received. 
    Now, the lawyer attorney provides for notice and neither Schlagenhauf nor we were given any notice whatever.

    Mr. Robert S. Smith

    It laid upon the Dockets of the Court for a period of 15 days which under the local rules are required in order to file anything in opposition, and it laid one day longer and then the District Judge entered this order upon February the 21st. 
    The trans -- the transcript in this case shows that it was served by United States mail pursuant to the federal rules and was put in the mails and there has never been in all of the transactions including before the Circuit Court of Appeals the suggestion until I just heard it that this petition was not properly filed and notice made and laid upon the Court records.

    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    That is correct sir but there was also a filing before there was filing action of the cross-claim. 
    Now I would like to point this out under our Federal Rules. 
    They have been most useful and in the discovery areas we place a lot of emphasis because we're really dealing with notice-pleading. 
    And we're not dealing with code-pleading as is suggested here. 
    This Rule does not say where the physical or mental condition is an issue, it says it is in controversy and I say it under the Federal Rules even if the forms were applied, if a plaintiff files a suit against two co-defendants and said “You are negligent,” that suffices. 
    From that point on the discovery of procedures are resorted to in order to get at the facts. 
    Now, it's always possible for a co-defendant under that situation to prove and to discover it that would enable them to side that the other co-defendant is solely negligent by his neglect. 
    But later under this particular District Court's requirement for purposes of instruction, there was a -- there was a letter part indicating that the mental and phy – physical condition of this petitioner was placed in issue by the contributory negligence allegation in the special answer.

    There was no formal, there was no formal hearing at anytime but there was the petition, there was an affidavit that by other discovery procedures it was discovered that the same driver Schlagenhauf for Greyhound that had a similar accident in Flat Rock, Michigan previously. 
    It was also pointed out that on the day of this very tragic accident there was another observer who was similarly positioned to Schlagenhauf on the highway and did see lights in this trailer for half a mile to three quarters and there was further evidence of discovery up to this time that was part of the affidavit that Schlagenhauf himself admitted that he saw lights for 10 to 15 seconds and although we're on a four-lane highway in which he has two lanes he made no effort to deviate or to move from that position. 
    So all of this was before the judge without any opposition filed under the local rules within the 15-day period that was laid upon the record sir.

    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    Well sir in the field of this sort of thing where there are visual problems. 
    In addition to that there can even be people who operate vehicles and become terrifically aggressive when they're in a vehicle and there's no other car. 
    There are instances when people are known under these situations to even have suicidal impacts. 
    Now, all of these factors including the visual where you can't find function, the disturbances is a proper area of psychiatry and there's no reason why we wouldn't examine this man from his eyesight and from other viewpoints and at the same time may find the underlying psychiatric problems that could lead here to the difficult so that the Court and we're dealing with a common carrier and I would like to point out this anomaly. 
    On page 36 I think of the petitioner's brief they point out that it would have sufficed had we taken the medical reports from the Interstate Commerce Commission upon this man Schlagenhauf and used them in the Court. 
    Now irrespective of the question of evidence on whether they could be, isn't it an interesting approach that this man is willing to submit himself to physical examinations by an administrative tribunal, but when the Court insist it becomes an issue of the inviolability of the person. 
    Now, there are constitute --

speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="1826.348" stopTime="1918.707">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    No sir. 
    I think that if there are affidavits filed that there are similar accidents that he's driving a vehicle in the Common Carrier type that other people saw a thing that he didn't see and that there was 10 to 15 seconds intervening that when that sort of cause is shown and then the -- those that oppose it do not come in within that 15-day period and lay up on the table any type of contrary affidavit or any type of contrary information then I say sir that a good cause is shown in the District Court, the respondent here was absolutely proper in exercising the discretion which is given to him under this rule and that it's becoming increasingly more useful in this complex society where there are people at the wheel or at the airplane or at the throttle on fast moving equipment and so on and these explanations of these accidents can also be uncovered through reasonable, physical examination. 
    Now I will say that of course the District Court cannot just automatically do it, but he must being on the firing line with the cause field that there's good and justifiable cause in order to grant such an order and I think that was replete here and it was so seen by the Seventh Circuit, Court of Appeals in considering this question.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1918.707" stopTime="1936.743">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The District Judge didn't exercised the -- apparently exercised a little discretion in granting this but he didn't even read your petition and are -- read it understandingly because he granted a good deal more than you asked for, didn't he? 
    He granted nine examinations instead of four.
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="1936.743" stopTime="2012.329">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    To that extent sir I think that is correct and whether or not the motive there was busy a judge who signed an order for which he should have made selection but the point still remains that after the Seventh Circuit decision is rendered and after the stay order was lifted this matter was represented to the crowd judge and he reduced these orders to four. 
    So as we stand here before this Court we‘re dealing with an order in which there were four physical examinations and the nine that was the subject to the Circuit Court of Appeals is a matter that is moot and we still say that unless the Court were to render a decision and vacuum it would -- the recognition of this new development in this case since the ord -- extraordinary writ of mandate is being sought that we're now dealing with multiple examinations of four and that is not shopping, I know of many, many instances where plaintiffs submit their cases upon medical evidence that involves their own doctors, their treating doctors, their experts and in addition thereto the defense so that it is not on them and counting to have four or five doctors testifying as to medical condition of an individual.

    This was an accident resulting in demands well in excess to $2 million, a young boy who is maimed for life with the most serious riding on a Common Carrier and the Common Carrier having two similar accidents with their driver of this sort and so on. 
    Now, there had been suggestions made to the Court that there were constitutional questions involved here. 
    And of course Sibbach, put at rest in our opinion any constitutional questions. 
    Now, with the precise --

    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    It -- it did this. It said that the -- that the Rule 35 was procedural in its origins. 
    It was therefore consistent with the Enabling Act and this Rule then was reported from the Court to the Congress without change or deviation and through that process. 
    I would say that that it was attacked on constitutional grounds, but it -- even Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent as to the reasoning said there's no question but what there's no constitutional question here that this is still within the power that it's still procedural and not subsidy and that it -- it's still consistent with the whole scheme of things under our discovery procedures.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Kightlinger what prompted the judge to provide for nine physicians to examine this man when even the parties only asked four?
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="2481.548" stopTime="2541.742">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    Mr. Chief Justice I think in all frankness to the Court that it was an example of a busy judge who had submitted to him a prepared order which is the custom in which there were nine named doctors from which he could make selection and instead of making this selection of the required number he by inadvertence signed the order as to the norm. 
    But that that would be my only explanation of the matter and I don't think it would have ever occurred had within the 15-day period, the petitioner made any steps here and we do all agree that busy trial judges who keep their calendars up frequently are confronted with these situations but that matter is that we have now appear before this Court is completely corrected. 
    And I think it's an important situation because this Court has never indulged in moot questions and has never indulged in thinking in vacuum and --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2541.742" stopTime="2560.286">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We might not agree with you on the -- on the mootness issue and that advantage does become material. 
    You -- you must argue that -- argue that he was entitled to a point these nine judges before the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals sustained it.
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="2560.286" stopTime="2568.153">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    Mr. Chief Justice we did so argue and there we argued also on behalf of the respondent because we don't know what was in his mind.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Beg your pardon?
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="2568.839" stopTime="2653.057">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    We don't know what was in his mind but we also argued there that he could have been motivated just as well in the exercise of the discretion by not putting all of Schlagenhauf's models in one basket if you want to out it that way and gave multiple examinations here so there would be no possible question after virtually this board of doctors reach their conclusion as to what was the true condition of this man and he was not being asked to submit to one doctor and what he might say but he was being asked to submit in all of these specialties so that there would be no question afterwards because of this disaster as to the situation. 
    So to that extent sir it was so argued before the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit took the position that this was a discretionary matter that it was within the corners of the court and it would not as an appeal Court invade the discretion of the court in the -- on the basis if this record in the trial court by the extraordinary writ of mandate which by has been stated by this Court time and time again should only be issued when the District Court is virtually nullifying the Rule by an excess exercise of power beyond the intention of the Rule.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And still it wouldn't be the views of discretion if the Judge requires nine examinations of the man instead of one.
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="2746.914" stopTime="2881.586">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    Multiple examinations as I've said had been recognized under rule and when we start drawing the line, is it going to be two, is it going to be five? I've pointed out that in my experience I have frequently found plaintiffs in serious cases with six doctors, five doctors, testifying. 
    Now I can see in this area of medical specialty and specialization that multiple examinations will be in appropriate cases will be the answer. 
    And they will be pursued and if they're on the plaintiff there's no reason in the world why they shouldn't be pursued and the defendant subjected to the same sort of discovery procedure and other in order to -- I know that then what are we doing. We're unearthing the truth, the truth for in the Courtroom. 
    And this suggestion of the inviolability of the person in this case where there's a qualified right to begin with is false – I suppose boy and girl today go down to get their license for their wedding, for a marriage, and are subjected to a requirement administratively, a blood test would prefer not to have such a test, but it's a qualified right. 
    You might say, well we don't have to get married. 
    They can refuse to get married but the point is that in our society these rights are qualified and there's no reason why this right shouldn't cut both ways in order for us to get at the backs prior to trial and in pretrial and find out frequently as it could have been here. 
    What could have been the cause of this tragic accident and what would have happened in the end? 
    Suppose this man submitted which he hasn't done now and we'd find there's nothing wrong physically or mentally with him. 
    He's been inconvenienced, yes, but supposed we find that he does have serious physical disability that accounts for these two accidents or mental disturbances that accounts for these two accidents, then I say a miscarriage of justice has been averted and the truth has been sustained in the spirit of the federal rule.

    Again, we're in areas where many of these things under rules are not reported. 
    The Dinsel -- the Dinsel case that's in this file indicates one Court felt that there was an inherent power in the Court to take a driver of a co-defendant -- of a defendant and subject him to a physical examination either even though the rule didn't apply.

    As a defendant though you cannot, the plaintiff was in this objective into the same examination, I assume that's not arguable.

    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Black that's exactly what has been argued and it had been argued by the petitioner here and they've even gone so far as to say that the rationale is if you pursue a remedy in the federal forum then you subject yourself on a waiver theory. 
    Now, our point about that is suppose the defendant removes the matter to federal court and he selected the forum does he then subject himself but the plaintiff does not. 
    Now all of the --

    If one of the arguments I'm not sure on what you say and what he says but you can examine to find if a physical defect like an absence of an arm or absence of vision see, but you can examine to see if the mental defect as did Mike have is or a motor disaster effect. 
    Is that one of the argument?
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="3159.723" stopTime="3216.373">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    As I view their brief, they're merely saying that a defendant and it's just not sub -- subject to a examination unless under some circumstances brought himself into the federal orbit of the forum and on a consent or waiver theory and they go back to the Botsford language and the use the Botsford language about the inviolability of the person and they bring it in to this courtroom at this later date and all these years after when we all know that we're dealing in no absolute sense with any rights in a modern society. 
    All rights are modified to the common good and this is one that is. 
    The power is clearly here, the -- the power to subject it as far as the defendant is concerned is clearly here. 
    And so this Court has narrowed down as we stand here at the moment to interfere with the discretion of the District Court on the theory of nine or four examinations as I see it and that's how this case is narrowed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3216.373" stopTime="3230.973">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I hope your case doesn't stand on this argument you have made with all individual rights in this country and be subjected by the legislative and to hit the grounds to what they say is the common good.

    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    No, I don't think I -- I meant that but I did say that the inviolability of the person certainly in a modern society as we hammer out the respective rights are not in any absolute sense particularly as we deal with it here such a right that it isn't qualified as to the common good of society. 
    Now that doesn't mean that any Court by virtually edict with this -- this thing here has been growing for five centuries, the assertion that it was not in the common law but for five centuries as Wigmore brings out clear back in the days when the emphasis upon the property.

    I suggest that you read -- I suggest that you read the state law that make you to ask the question unless they've changed as I knew them but at least [Inaudible] practically, one of the best thing that the party in the lawsuit did in that case would try to find that if the plaintiff or the other fellow was not the man who is doing the work possibly injury and did have some defect and to find out if there was any negligence that was the purpose of the discovery instantly in those kinds of cases.
speaker="erle_a_kightlinger" startTime="3312.696" stopTime="3338.316">
    Mr. Erle A. Kightlinger 
    We do that too and the point is that by the process of discovery there are many of these cases disposed then without trial because the truth is out upon the -- on the table and for all to see and of all these cases had be to tried, the -- the federal courts would be so congested as they are in many instances that would be impossible that's how useful the discovery are.

    You're drawing a distinction not as I understand it, not between whether the issue is one of negligence but whether the relief of question is a physical or mental examination of the party.

    That was before their motion and there motion refers to the letter, refers to their claim of mental incompetence.
