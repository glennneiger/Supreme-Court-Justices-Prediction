    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors. 
    This case comes here from the District of Columbia Circuit on the petitions of the Comptroller of the Currency and of the Whitney National Bank of Jefferson Parish. 
    At the suit of the three respondent banks all of them state banks alleging standing on the basis of competitive injury and at the suit of the Louisiana Banking Commissioner, the courts below have permanently enjoined the Comptroller of the Currency from issuing a so-called certificate of authority which is the last document of title that a National Bank Association requires, requires in order to open its doors and commence doing business as a national bank. 
    The District Court granted its injunction solely on the ground that a Louisiana statute was effective to forbid the opening of the National Bank. 
    That statute was passed as emergency legislation while the complaint in this case was pending in the District Court. 
    The Louisiana Act purports to forbid any bank which is a subsidiary of a holding company and Whitney-Jefferson is that. 
    From opening for business in Louisiana it -- it has not yet done so. 
    The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion namely that a permanent injunction against the Comptroller should issue but it reached that result by a quite different route. 
    It concluded that the opening of Whitney-Jefferson would be a violation of federal law relating to the establishment of a branch or branch office of a bank. 
    The Court of Appeals was aware that the Federal Reserve Board which administers the Bank Holding Company Act had approved after full administrative proceedings the relationship between Whitney-Jefferson and its parent the Whitney Holding Company.

    The Court of Appeals did not say that the Federal Reserve Board's order which incidentally has been appealed by two of these same respondents to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit a case which has been argued by -- before that court. 
    The Court of Appeals did not say that the Board's order was invalid nor did it rule upon the question whether Louisiana's statute relating to subsidiaries of bank holding companies could validly forbid the opening of this contemplated national bank.

speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="477.787" stopTime="814.194">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    No, Your Honor it's quite light. 
    I do wish to make perfectly clear, however, that the objections to this action are quite different. 
    That here we claim there is a fundamental jurisdictional bar in the Fifth Circuit, we think, the merits are open. 
    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Comptroller was about to violate Section 36 (c) of the Banking Act of 1933, a section which adopts by reference to state laws governing state banks certain geographical restrictions upon the opening of branch offices. 
    Now, we think that this is a fundamentally wrong decision on the Court of Appeals' part because there is no basis as we read the relevant statutes for treating a separately chartered institution whether or not a subsidiary of a holding company as a branch of a bank. 
    Whitney-Jefferson to be sure is a holding company subsidiary. 
    By the same token, it is also an affiliate of other subsidiaries of Whitney Holding Company but it is not a branch as that term is used or has ever been used in the banking industry. 
    Branch banking and holding company banking are different institutions and have long been recognized as such. 
    Back in 1931, in one of the leading articles in the field being Jefferson Fordham to cite one of many commentators who had been unanimous, I think, in making this observation noted and I quote from him “that the rapid spread and growth of group i.e. holding company banking is due in large part to the widespread restrictions on branch banking.” 
    A holding company affiliate as I shall elaborate later is not a branch in the language of the Banking Act and it is not a branch for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
    This I would emphasize is not a matter of insisting on correct terminology for reasons of nice fit. 
    The considerations which determine when a national bank is qualified to organize and to commence operations and also when a national bank may establish a branch office are committed to the determination of the Comptroller under certain specified standards. 
    So far as branching is concerned, he is directed by Section 36 (c) to refer to state geographical restrictions upon branch banking. 
    Congress, however, adopted a separate statute, the Holding Company Act in order to regulate comprehensively the establishment of bank holding companies and the operations and acquisitions of such holding companies. 
    That statute has its own standards. 
    It has its own provisions for the conduct of administrative proceedings and the subject matter with which it deals embraces the very question here at issue, the propriety of a holding company's acquisition and in certain circumstances of a bank subsidiary that subject matter is committed to the judgment of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board and there are no geographical, relevant geographical restrictions in the Bank Holding Company Act. 
    A bank holding company may have subsidiaries. 
    Many of them do in two different counties or parishes of the state, in circumstances where a bank in one of those counties would not be free to establish a branch in the other. 
    This, we shall argue, represents a most deliberate decision on Congress' part. 
    Let me anticipate now to the extent of quoting Senator Robertson who was the sponsor and manager of the Senate Bill which became the Bank Holding Company Act. 
    He stated, and I'm referring to page 56 of the governments brief, the committee that is the Senate Committee decided against the inclusion of a provision in the bill, this was the House Bill which would automatically apply state laws concerning branch banking to bank holding company operations. 
    This provision was contained in the House Bill and was advocated by the Independent Bankers Association. 
    And then he goes on to say, “A bank branch is by form ownership and functions vastly different from a bank holding company affiliate.”

    Oh! 
    They are and no doubt that the State of Louisiana could pass a law that would prohibit the formation of holding companies under any charter from that state but we think the branch banking restrictions do not in any way control the Federal Reserve Board. 
    We also question the Louisiana statute in this case not on the ground that Louisiana could not prohibit the chartering of bank holding companies in that state but on the ground that it cannot permit a nationa -- forbid a national bank to open. 
    We question the form of the regulation which is adopted and that is the point through which counsel for the bank is going to address himself in his argument. 
    I'm going to concentrate on the relationship of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Act.

    And your suggestion is that the Congress in dealing with the bank holding companies deliberately that that is a decision by Congress to proscribe the treatment of -- of holding Company subsidiaries as branches.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="916.750" stopTime="972.846">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes. 
    The Congress adopted separate -- a separate statute, separate standard, separate administrative agencies for the regulation of branch banking on the one hand and holding company or group banking on the other. 
    If one confuses to separately chartered corporations which are subsidiaries of a holding company which are treated throughout the federal statutes as affiliates with two branches of the same institution and then I think the almost inevitable consequence is, one, to confuse the provisions of the Holding Company Act and its standards with those of the Banking Act; two, to confuse the authority of the two separate agencies which Congress has set up to regulate these two separate institutions; and three, to confuse the provisions for judicial review which made thereafter be available and all of these things have taken place in this case as I see it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="972.846" stopTime="981.240">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does the Board have any function with relations to administrative function with relation to branch banking?
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="981.240" stopTime="1088.439">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    No sir. 
    From the government's standpoint, these confusions that I have, I should pause a moment and say that if branch banks are members of the Federal Reserve System, they would be subject of course to those requirements not for purposes relevant here. 
    This confusion of the authority of the two agencies is the matter of primary concern from the government's standpoint here. 
    Whether the arrangement proposed by the Whitney Group is a good one, whether it should have been approved by the Federal Reserve Board or not, is a question from our view secondary to the fundamental issues which this case raises. 
    Namely, what is the system of regulation, where does the administrative responsibility lie and what has the Congress provided with respect to judicial review. 
    Let me emphasize that the sole point decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in this case is that the Whitney Bank program violates branch banking restrictions. 
    Now, those restrictions are inapplicable to holding company affiliates and if as we are convinced, the appraisal of a holding company relationship is in any event committed exclusively to the Reserve Board's jurisdiction. 
    It follows that the merits of this proposal submitted by the Whitney Group can only be examined in the Board proceeding and on review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit assuming for the moment that --

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    I think the Comptroller's authority is to determine whether the applicant for certificate authority meets the qualifications of the Banking Act. 
    If there's something -- if the holding company relationship is one which the Board shouldn't have approved because it was for an illegitimate purpose or there was -- there were any bad effects which might be envisioned, I think that that is solely a matter that the Board can determine and which must be determined upon review of the Board's order. 
    Of course, the Comptroller can raise any question he wishes before the Board. 
    He is -- the Board is called upon under the statute to solicit the views of the Comptroller of the Currency in any case where the bank holding company proposes to acquire an interest in the national bank and in the same way to solicit views of the responsible state banking commissioners if the acquisitions relate to state banks. 
    Those recommendations however are not binding the decision of this issue if submitted to the Federal Reserve Board.

    I don't think it's a question of sham, Your Honor. 
    Holding companies doubtless are formulated. 
    They have been or formed, they doubtless have been for 40 years because there are certain advantages and certain disadvantages in going that route as opposed to going another route such as operating a chain banking system or a branch banking system. 
    Insofar as there are any relevant policies that ought to be considered by the responsible agency in deciding whether a particular holding company relationship is good, bad or indifferent, it seems to me those objections must under the statutory scheme be presented to the Board.

    Suppose that he had said that the dog is a cat. 
    I'm talking about that kind. 
    What you have here is an argument as I understand it. 
    I don't know what's right or what's wrong but that this is not the real, genuine holding company within the meaning of the law but is in reality a branch, branch bank disguised under the label of the holding -- holding company there. 
    Who has the right to determine that? 
    Do you say that the courts can't determine that and that has to be determined by the Federal Reserve Board?
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="1309.140" stopTime="1366.009">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    I'd say that the courts can determine it on review of the Federal Reserve Board's order, Your Honor. 
    Here, what we have here is an application filed with the Federal Reserve Board by a -- to form a holding company and to acquire a stock of a subsidiary bank. 
    Every formal requirement of a holding company and every incident of the holding company is present. 
    Now, if there are reasons, if there are objections to approving the establishment of this holding company or the acquisition which this holding company proposes to make and if the Board does not take proper account of all of the relevant policy considerations which it should, I say those are certainly matters which are reviewable but they are reviewable in the way that Congress is provided, namely by appeal to the Court of Appeals from the Federal Reserve Board's order.

    Perhaps as a matter of stating a little more detail, then I have a few of the facts which I haven't put fully before Your Honors, Whitney National Bank of New Orleans, not Jefferson Parish is the largest bank in that city. 
    New Orleans, like many cities, has spread and Whitney-New Orleans desired to engage in multiple-unit banking and to follow its customers into Jefferson Parish. 
    It could not have established a branch in Jefferson Parish because Louisiana law which is adopted as a matter of federal law by Section 36(c) provides that a bank may not establish a branch in a parish other than the one in which its head office is located. 
    Whitney's New Orleans considered two other well worn avenues for engaging in multiple-unit banking.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Multiple-unit, I mean to cover branch banking, chain banking and holding company banking. 
    One method would have been for the stockholders of Whitney-New Orleans to form a bank in Jefferson Parish. 
    This had been done by two of Whitney's competitors. 
    One of these the second largest bank in New Orleans known as the National Bank of Commerce has established through the same stockholders an affiliate bank known as the National Bank of Commerce in Jefferson Parish and it's widely known as chain banking. 
    Apparently for reasons of convenience, one of them that Whitney-New Orleans had a very large body of shareholders. 
    It decided that it would seek permission to form a holding company which once organized would hold the stock both of Whitney and New Orleans and of the new bank in contemplation, the Whitney-Jefferson. 
    Now, this type of group or holding company banking is also widely prevalent. 
    There are some 1800 banking units in the country which are controlled by holding companies. 
    Now, how do this Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller fit into this picture? 
    First, is to the Federal Reserve Board. 
    Beginning the 1950s, the Board had expressed its concern to Congress that although it had some limited authority under the Banking Act of 1933 to deal with holding company practices, there was no limit whatsoever upon the ability of bank holding companies to expand their acquisitions. 
    Congress responded by adopting the Bank Holding Company Act and under Section 3 of that statute which is reprinted in page 81 of our brief, it is unlawful for a bank holding company to be established without prior approval of the Board. 
    Moreover, the bank holding company once it is established may not acquire control of an additional bank without Board approval. 
    The section goes on to state that if a bank holding company proposes to acquire a national bank, the Comptroller shall be notified, so that he may state his recommendation. 
    There are provisions for public notice and hearing at which public officials and other interested parties may participate and the factors which the Board is to consider are set forth in Section 3 (c) which begins on page 82. 
    There are five criteria. 
    The financial history and condition of the company and the bank's concern their prospects, the character of their management, the convenience, needs, and welfare of the communities, and area of concern, and finally whether or not the effect of such acquisition would be to expand the size of the bank holding company system beyond limits consistent with sound banking, the public interest and the preservation of competition.

speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="1827.551" stopTime="2155.413">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes sir. 
    In the case of an acquisition of a state bank, the State Banking Commissioner rather than the Controller is solicited to submit his recommendations. 
    Finally, as I indicated, the Act makes provision for judicial review in the Courts of Appeals. 
    Now, it follows from what I'd said I think that if the Whitney interest operating in holding company form had proposed to acquire for some existing bank in Jefferson Parish, there would have been no occasion whatever to file any application of any kind with the Comptroller of the Currency. 
    It would have been necessary to obtain the Board's approval of that acquisition. 
    The added element is introduced in this case only because it was proposed both to establish a holding company and to establish a new national bank as to the latter feature. 
    Therefore, it was necessary to go before the Comptroller. 
    Now, word about his authority, he is directed to authorize a company to become a national bank if it meets standards which are set forth in the Banking Act. 
    This referred to the provisions of that Act alone. 
    He has to determine whether the amount of capital paid in meets the requirements of the statute or the qualifications of the stockholders and directors and other matters of that character. 
    The Banking Act imposed no limitation upon expansion by means of group banking or chain banking. 
    Now, the Comptroller is essentially an examining official. 
    He makes his determination whether to grant a certificate ex parte. 
    He makes detailed examinations but he is not directed to conduct any adversary hearings and there's no provision in that statute in the Bank Act for judicial review with his determinations. 
    The Whitney Bank first submitted its proposal to establish this new national bank that was then controlled by Mr. Gidney to obtain his preliminary approval for the establishment of a separately chartered bank in Jefferson Parish. 
    After examining into the proposed management, its capital structure and so forth Mr. Gidney concluded that it would meet the qualifications of the Bank Act and gave preliminary approval subject to the Board's approval of the holding company aspects of the arrangement. 
    The holding company proposal was then duly submitted to the Reserve Board. 
    Notice was published and three banking competitors expressed written condition. 
    The present respondents were silent, the Comptroller's recommendation was solicited and Mr. Gidney recommended in favor of approval. 
    A public hearing was ordered to afford further opportunity to any interesting party to participate. 
    This was noticed in the Federal Register and widely publicized. 
    Still none of the present respondents appeared in the administrative proceeding. 
    It went forward. 
    The Board ultimately entered an opinion in order with one governor dissenting approving the application to establish the holding company and to make the acquisition of stock in Whitney-Jefferson. 
    In its opinion, the Board concluded that the five statutory criteria I mentioned a few moments ago had been met. 
    It provided further that the stock acquisition was not to be affected for a week thereafter. 
    No petitions for rehearing were filed during that time. 
    More than a month after the Board had approved the establishment of Whitney holding and the acquisition of the Whitney-Jefferson stock, respondents were heard from for the first time. 
    At that point they commenced an action against the Comptroller charging him with a violation of the branch banking laws and only some days later did they first petition the Federal Reserve Board for reconsideration. 
    That petition was denied and that thereafter respondents appealed the Board's order to the Fifth Circuit where they are making virtually the same arguments as they have made in this case. 
    I'd like to emphasize that though there are doubtless similarities between branch and group banking there are also important differences. 
    In branch banking, all of the units constitute a single enterprise with one capital structure, one management, one set of directors. 
    A deposit in a branch office has the same status as one in the main office and is backed by the capital and assets of the entire bank. 
    In a holding company system, each subsidiary is necessarily a separate corporation. 
    Each has its own capital funds. 
    There can be no transfers between affiliated banks. 
    Each has its own borrowing and lending limitations. 
    Each set of directors is personally liable. 
    But more importantly, Congress was completely aware of these differences.

speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="2171.479" stopTime="2353.565">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Not unless the Federal Reserve Board disapprove the character of the management (Voice Overlap) in particular case. 
    Now, in the Banking Act of 1933, the Congress made a comprehensive study of group banking, chain banking, and branch banking. 
    It treated them differently. 
    For example, in Section 61 the Congress -- of the Banking Act the Congress provided a measure of regulation for holding companies, a holding company couldn't vote the stock of a -- it couldn't vote bank stock without a permit from the Board. 
    However -- and also the 1933 Act regulated the loans by or to affiliates but it did not limit acquisitions by holding companies. 
    In the 1950s, as I indicated, the Reserve Board became concerned that there was no limitation upon the possibilities of expansion through the holding company device. 
    When a proposal to regulate holding company acquisitions came before the Congress in 1955 and 1956, the Independent Bankers Association specifically proposed that the law be drawn so that a holding company could not have subsidiaries in two different places where state law would prohibit a single bank from having two branches. 
    I noted at the outset to Senator Robertson's comment, let me refer very briefly, my time is running fast, to what the committee stated in its reports which appeared at pages 55 and 56 of the government's brief. 
    In the middle of the page, you will notice I won't read the full excerpt that the committee states that a federal standard should determine and that the approval or disapproval of the holding company acquisition should not be referred to state law. 
    The ultimate determination, I quote, of public interest in the national bank system should rest with the appropriate federal authorities and even more pointedly beginning at the bottom of that page, the committee decided against the inclusion of the provision in the bill that would automatically apply state laws concerning branch banking to bank holding company operations. 
    The purposes of branch banking laws are not identical with the purpose of this bill to control bank holding companies. 
    It is believed that the bill contains adequate provisions to regulate bank holding company operations without an arbitrary tie-in with branch banking laws. 
    Thanks to us that the unavoidable conclusion is that the Federal Reserve Board was empowered to pass on this acquisition under the standards set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act.

    I think there is room certainly for the Federal Reserve Board to consider when it passes upon an application to acquire an interest in a state bank, the policies of the state, and that the public interest factor and the reference to the areas concerned which appears in Section 3 (c) of the Holding Company Act furnishes that latitude.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    The state can -- can pass and Section 7 clearly reserved that power, a law as many states have some 16 or 17, I believe, which forbids the formation of any bank holding company in that state.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2463.503" stopTime="2467.302">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But it's your position that that applies only to state banks?
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="2467.302" stopTime="2578.619">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    No, it can prohibit the formation of a bank holding company under the law of that state. 
    Actually, Louisiana did not do that. 
    It chartered the way of holding company. 
    It could have had a law that it would not charter any holding companies and then the Bank Holding Company Act in Section 3 (d) also permit the -- permits the state to say that it doesn't want any of its banks owned by an out of state holding company because the Board has directed not to approve an acquisition by a holding company in the state A -- of a bank -- of bank stock in state B if state B has a law against such acquisitions. 
    I would like to sum up in just a few sentences. 
    The claim here is that the Comptroller was about to violate branch of banking restrictions. 
    We say, that this case properly speaking, does not involve branches or branch banking. 
    It involves holding company affiliates. 
    We say the Congress has recognized the difference for many years and without exception that it has provided a completely separate and comprehensive means of regulating expansion through holding company systems that this regulation is by the Board. 
    Accordingly, we would urge that this attack must fail whatever may be said pro or con as to the wisdom of the Board's decision because these respondents have relied on the wrong statute, they've challenged the wrong order and they proceeded in the wrong Court and that I say should be conclusive of this lawsuit whatever it may leave for decision in the Fifth Circuit. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Dean Acheson
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2578.619" stopTime="2580.196">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Acheson?
speaker="dean_acheson" startTime="2580.196" stopTime="2771.926">
    Mr. Dean Acheson 
    May it please the Court. 
    I shall address myself to the Louisiana statute which has been put forward in this case as an alternative ground for granting the injunction, a ground that's not accepted by the Court of Appeals but accepted by the District Court. 
    First of all, I want to draw the Court's attention to the statute itself. 
    This is a criminal statute. 
    It's a statute which reads on actions by citizens of Louisiana. 
    It has a section which makes five acts illegal and punishable by fines and or imprisonment. 
    This section reads, “It shall be unlawful” and then follow four provisions which are not involved in this case and not applicable. 
    And finally there is a fifth section. 
    It shall be unlawful for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof to open for business any bank not now open for business whether or not a charter, permit, license or certificate to open for business has already been issued and this section is specifically made applicable to a national bank and in this case is sought to be made applicable to one. 
    It is not in dispute between the parties in this litigation that without some permission from Congress, this statute would be unconstitutional. 
    It is argued that Congress has given that permission in Section 7 of the National Bank Holding Company Act which has just been referred to by the Chief Justice. 
    Before attending to that section, I should like to make one exclusionary point. 
    It has been argued in the brief that other states have the same or similar statutes to that of Louisiana and that these statutes have been upheld. 
    This is in error. 
    The bank examiner of Louisiana in his brief candidly admits that he says, “Respondent will concede that there is no other state Bank Holding Company Act which has the exact language contained in Section 1035 of the Louisiana Act.” 
    He could have gone further and conceded that there's no other state act which has any provision remotely similar to subsection 5 of the Act and indeed that no state act undertakes to enforce its restrictions against bank holding companies by operating upon the opening or closing of a national bank so that the authorities sought to be derived from other statutes and other decisions is not correct.

speaker="dean_acheson" startTime="2780.870" stopTime="2818.610">
    Mr. Dean Acheson 
    Now, Mr. Justice there are states which have the exact four provisions of the Louisiana statute and then stopped and this is almost the identical legislation that occurs in other states. 
    They are the same as Louisiana except they do not contain Section 5 which solely is invoked here. 
    Now, it is argued as I said that Section 7 permits the Louisiana Act as in Section sub 5. 
    Section 7 reads as follows --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I have it.
speaker="dean_acheson" startTime="2837.186" stopTime="3092.796">
    Mr. Dean Acheson 
    You have it. 
    Section 7 reads as follows, this is Section 7 of the National Bank Holding Company Act. 
    The enactment by Congress in this chapter shall not be construed as preventing any state from exercising such powers and jurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to banks, bank holding companies and subsidiaries thereof. 
    In order to make it very clear what the Congress meant by this section, the Senate Committee have the following in its report to the Senate. 
    It said, a great deal of concern has been expressed that Section 7 of this bill granted new authority and powers to states over national banks in general and respecting the stocks of national banks in particular. 
    In order to clarify the legislative history of Section 7, the committee wishes to emphasize that this section does not grant any new authority to states over national banks. 
    The purpose of this action is to preserve to the states those powers which they now have in our dual banking system. 
    It is always of upper most importance a legislation of this nature to preserve the dual system of national and state banks and Section 7 must be viewed in that light. 
    Thus, if the Court please, it is clear from this statement that Section 7 neither increased nor reduced the preexisting state powers. 
    It expressed the congressional intention not to extend federal preemption into the field of the regulation of bank holding companies. 
    It did not narrow the field of preemption in regard to national banks. 
    It kept open for state legislation the field in which the statute operated, that is the field of bank holding companies. 
    It did not open to state legislation the field which the National Bank Act and the decisions of this Court had closed. 
    This is a matter of most important legislative practice and it's an area which we would be brought in the greatest confusion if the views of the respondents were adopted. 
    Well, for instance, let me point out how this confusion occurs in the mind of the counsel for Louisiana, the state bank examiner. 
    In his brief he writes this, “If the Congress has preserved to the states the right to prohibit and restrict the expansion of bank holding companies,” and it has this is clearly the purpose of Section 7 to keep open to the states the right to prohibit and res -- restrict the expansion of bank holding companies and he goes on, “there is no difference between provisions which seek to restrict bank holding companies by one, prohibiting the acquisition of stock in a national bank or two, by prohibiting a subsidiary of a bank holding company not already open for business from opening for business.” 
    Now, what is asserted here as contending no difference is the very issue at stake in this case and the difference is as plain, as plain can be. 
    Provision one prevents a holding company from acquiring bank stock whether it is national bank stock or other banks stock. 
    Provision two, however, prevents an approved national bank from opening its doors. 
    The incidence of provision one falls on bank holding companies which are open for state regulations. 
    The incidence of provision two falls on national banks which are closed to state regulation. 
    Congress wished to leave one free and to leave the other closed.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="dean_acheson" startTime="3108.257" stopTime="3307.429">
    Mr. Dean Acheson 
    That's the -- they -- they're not involved here at all. 
    If the Louisiana statute stopped the Section 4, subsection 4, it would not be invoked in this case at all. 
    It wouldn't be relevant. 
    None of its provisions would be applicable. 
    It is only when the statute attempts to keep close the bank which the Federal Government is trying to open that it is involved here and it is unconstitutional. 
    The system which is created by the holding company legislation and the national bank legislation is very clear and very worthy. 
    It is provided in the National Bank Holding Company Act that states are protected against the invasion of foreign holding companies. 
    The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from permitting any holding company to buy the stock of any bank in the state which does not want that to occur. 
    In fact, it says, it may permit the purchase of bank stock by a foreign holding company only in banks and estate which expressly by legislation permits this to happen. 
    Then it leaves open through the state the power to prohibit holding companies altogether and to restrict the expansion of those which already exists. 
    There is a perfect balance and scheme in this legislation which is entirely were. 
    Now, if it is that that scheme is invaded by the provision sought to be exactly held here we immediately get into most dangerous situations. 
    There is a con -- confrontation directly between the state and the federal government. 
    Let us presume that this state had sought to be, this statute had sought to be invoked according to its terms. 
    You see it doesn't read now at all upon the Comptroller. 
    The Comptroller is only enjoined here, I suppose, by some theory that if he issues this certificate he will contribute to the delinquency of a citizen of Louisiana. 
    This is a criminal statute which says citizens of Louisiana may not form holding companies, may not open banks including national banks. 
    Presume then that the Comptroller had issued this certificate without interference and that the state had then sought to indict and toput into penitentiary the men who were authorized by the Comptroller to open the national bank. 
    There you would have a direct confrontation between the power of the State of Louisiana and the authority of the United States of America and under the decisions of this Court stemming from the Cook County case in 1882, the very last session of this Court has been clear that the National Banking Act creates a complete system for the establishment, formation and operation of national banks in which no state may interfere in anyway whatever. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Edward L. Merrigan

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="3308.555" stopTime="3486.469">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In order to put the Court of Appeals' decision in this case in its proper perspective and in order to put the questions actually presented by this case in their proper perspective I beg to leave the Court to refer just briefly that some of their real facts of this case that has yet been developed from an undisputed record. 
    The record in this case consists in the main, if it please the Court, of exhibits and testimony introduced into this case by the petitioners themselves mainly by the Comptroller of the Currency, in other words testimony by the president of the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans, sworn affidavits of the Comptroller of the Currency and other documents which have been filed in this case by the petitioners. 
    Now, these facts, may it please the Court, the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans is the largest bank by far in the entire state of Louisiana. 
    It's one of the largest things in the entire southern portion of the United States. 
    For approximately 80 years, Whitney has operated its offices limited to the confines of the City of New Orleans, Parish of Orleans. 
    Orleans Parish being the same territorial limitation as the City of New Orleans. 
    Through these operations which are admittedly and concededly in this case properly restricted by a combination of Section 36 of the National Bank Act and Louisiana Revised Statute 654 to the limits of New Orleans. 
    Whitney has grown to a position of banking dominance where it controls approximately $500 million in resources approximately $14 million in undivided profit and approximately $27,200 in a surplus account. 
    Whitney-New Orleans with these constitutional proper limit -- limitations prescribed by the Congress in the State of Louisiana and admittedly still fully applicable today has accumulated at its bank in New Orleans, its original bank in the 12 branches, 39% of the total deposits in all banks in Orleans Parish. 
    It has also accumulated approximately 44% of all deposits of individuals, partnership, and corporations in the parish. 
    Now, just as in the side comparing notes figured with the figures that were presented to this Court by the Philadelphia National Bank case, if the merger which this Court struck down has been approved, it would have involved approximately 30% of the banking business in Philadelphia that is that the merger is going through. 
    Here, before the plan which is even proposed, has even going into effect Whitney already controls approximately 40 to 44% of the business available in New Orleans.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    No Your Honor. 
    This argument is more relevant to the question of standing to sue here which we're going to be getting into when I approach it because it's a type of competition, the type of destructive unlawful competition which does confront the respondents in -- in this case and indicate -- should indicate why the statutes have been passed. 
    Section 36 of the National Bank Act in the Louisiana statutes, these are really antitrust statutes in essence which were passed to limit these banks to the confines of their own, the certain confines in order to keep them from expanding throughout a state and taking away the business of the other banks. 
    Some states for example as Your Honor pointed out in the Philadelphia National Bank case can't branch at all such as in Illinois and these statutes have been passed to keep banks from just becoming big and spreading throughout the state. 
    But as I say, it would apply Your Honor to whether if you were a large or a small bank but in this case the injury is compounded by the fact that this is the largest bank in the State of Louisiana. 
    Now, as indicated by the petitioners in their opening arguments, it is conceded that Whitney National is absolutely prohibited from going over into Jefferson Parish to open banking offices. 
    The stipulation is contained in both petitioners briefs and as I understood the argument made by Mr. Spritzer this morning it's absolutely conceived that Whitney-New Orleans there's no statutory right of any kind to leave the confines of New Orleans and open any banking offices in Jefferson Parish and nevertheless as pointed out by the government this morning, Whitney is still, Whitney-New Orleans has still been exceedingly desire over a long period of years of leaving New Orleans and opening banking offices in Jefferson Parish.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, I say this Your Honor that they actually did consider getting an affiliate and the president of Whitney-New Orleans actually was shown to testify that they rejected the affiliate arrangement because it was -- they couldn't hold on to it and necessarily I think that was the type of testimony he gave. 
    He said an affiliate does not become part of our organization. 
    It's just sort of hanging loosely to use these words that you have these conflicts of interest in its office. 
    So while they actually did consider the possibility of an affiliate arrangement, they rejected it because it did not have the completeness of control and the continuity of control that Whitney wanted when it wanted to go out in the Jefferson Parish with his holding company approach.

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="3762.533" stopTime="3771.922">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    That's correct, Justice Stewart. 
    It would involve some of the stockholders of Whitney or all of the stockholders of Whitney going out in the Jefferson Parish and raising new fresh capital of their own --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3771.922" stopTime="3772.488">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="3772.488" stopTime="3827.226">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    -- and putting that into a new bank which they would then organize. 
    Now, under this holding company approach as I'm going to show in just a moment, the funds were actually drawn out of Whitney-New Orleans into the holding company and then out of the holding company into the other bank in Jefferson Paris. 
    So there was that -- and of course in the affiliate arrangement, those two banks can compete for the same business and as they point out there are conflicts of interests between the two banks. 
    The bank in Jefferson may compete for the same business as the Bank in New Orleans wants but they are stopped by the conflicts of interest facing substantially the same Board of Directors from going after the same business. 
    So in order to avoid all of this and in order to be able to have absolute control over the two banks and in order to have the funds drawn out of Whitney-New Orleans without the necessity of raising new fresh capital, they adopted as the President of Whitney-New Orleans testifying, the holding company approach.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Whenever the bank holding company does not take the fund it employs -- let's start from the beginning, if I might Justice White. 
    In this case, the Court of Appeals as you know held this to be a branch because it was organized with the funds of the first bank. 
    That is the -- that starts to change, in other words --

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    I would say anytime a banks sets out to evade Section 36 and admit it's trying to evade Section 36 by forming a corporation, a holding company through which it can site it's own funds into the opening of the other office and it intends to run both that way not with fresh funds invested by the holding company but with the banks own funds, then you have a situation where the rule of the Court of Appeals is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3938.028" stopTime="3955.795">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that even in those states which permit bank holding companies but prevent branches, this rule of the Court of Appeals would prevent as a federal rule the bank holding company because the federal rule would be, this is a branch?

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    I don't think I can agree completely with Your Honor on that. 
    I think what the Court of Appeals has said that it feels that when a bank sets out to evade the branch restrictions of law solely by forming its own holding company through which it can pass its own funds to open the office and nullify the law, yes, I think the Court of Appeals decision would apply.

    I know of no state law which would approve such a holding company operation Your Honor but assuming a state law did provide for the establishment of a holding company to operate within the limits of the state law, I think that would still be open to attack if -- if this type of procedure will follow to evade and to frustrate and to repeal in all effect Section 36 (c) of the National Bank Act.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    I think that's entirely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's why I'm reviewing the facts because I think these facts established as an undisputed record based on the testimony of the petitioners would show I think the unheard ventures that they set out to do it. 
    They did it in the most careful way. 
    They went to the Comptroller of the Currency and got his advice and consent before they move one step down the road. 
    They operated with the Comptroller of the Currency the whole way and the sole purpose was to evade Section 36 and that's what I say the record in this case does show without any doubt.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There is a very essential difference from the very beginning. 
    In a chain bank, that is the affiliate which was involved in the Camden Trust case in which I just discussed with by Justice Stewart. 
    You have the situation where some of the stockholders or all of the stockholders, if it's a small bank, set out and raise new money, new capital to form a new bank, in other words, a brand new bank which has no direct connection with the first bank.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    No, we say there is no significant difference, there is no difference of substance, it's all difference of form and we -- we say then that you should apply the rule which has been applied for years back to the Northern Security case that equity looks at substance not form, that the corporate entities which are established for the purpose of evading a law, the law looks, it does not -- it is not going to let the law be frustrated by mere forms but it's going to be governed entirely by the substance of the transactions.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What I understood counsel for the government to say that -- that each of these banks must stand on its own financial structure and they were limited and they're borrowing and they're lending by their -- by their assets and liabilities and that includes the branch of a branched bank, is it?
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="4178.964" stopTime="4231.070">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    I say, that's correct, Your Honor that in a branch bank situation obviously the -- the parent bank and the branch bank do have to combine lending authority of the two banks. 
    In this case, the testimony has been given in the record by Mr. Gilly, the executive vice president of this bank formerly the executive vice president of Whitney-New Orleans is also the president of Whitney-Jefferson and by Mr. Barry who is the president of Whitney-New Orleans that the two banks would have their combined deposits to work with through the holding company, would then have their combined loans to be made through the two, in other words they'd share loans and it's a very simple procedure to follow. 
    If a borrower comes into the bank out in Jefferson Parish and wants to borrow more than the fixed -- the 10% of the capital of Whitney-Jefferson, they simply get an officer in Whitney-New Orleans to come in and sit down with him in the two banks and share the same loan so it's --

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    I say well and that's one and that is of course true that any two friendly banks can do that but in this case they specifically kept that in mind and of course using the funds from one bank, the $650,000 which was used to establish Whitney-Jefferson is drawn right out of Whitney-New Orleans and put over in Whitney-Jefferson so that when they make a loan out of Whitney-Jefferson, they're actually using the funds originally from Whitney-New Orleans to make the loan anyway.

    The Board, Your Honor, cannot in any case pass on the validity of the bank a writ or come to the -- come to grips with what the Congress has prescribed must become the grips with under Section 27 of the National Bank Act whether the proposed bank is -- is lawfully entitled to commence business and whether the bank is proposed to be open for a legitimate object contemplated by the Bank Act and we say in this case that this was an illegitimate object from the very beginning to whip a proposed intentional purposeful evasion of Section 36 of the National Bank Act.

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="4813.919" stopTime="4889.635">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, let's just examine the statutory way in which he participates before the Board. 
    The application is filed Mr. Justice White. 
    The Federal Reserve Board then gives the Comptroller a notice that the application has been filed. 
    The Comptroller then, if he disapproves, the Board must hold a statutory public hearing in Louisiana under the Administrative Procedure Act where the bank can come in and add their views on the subject but in this case, the minute the Comptroller approves that obviates the necessity for any public hearing, statutory hearing before the Board. 
    So what the Board did in this case they didn't hold the hearing prescribed by the statute, they didn't have a trial examiner or hearing examiner take testimony cross-examine, hear opponents and so forth, they simply held a meeting up here in Washington before the Board at which they accepted a series of views presented by the bank itself and by the minority stockholders of the bank who came in and said, “This is terrible, don't let them do it” and then by one other bank official from Louisiana who apparently got notice of it or wind of it and came up here and participated. 
    But frankly, we had no notice and there was no statutory public hearing held in Louisiana where we could rush in and make a lot of objections and cross-examine witnesses and participate.

    They accepted a series of unsworn views from the president of Whitney-New Orleans, a series of views from one of the dissenting stockholders of Whitney-New Orleans, a series of views from the attorneys or some of the other minority stockholders, and then a statement by one other official of another national bank who did come up here and oppose it.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, positively. 
    Because in this case now, the statute, the Federal Reserve Board's statute, the Holding Company Act gives you 60 days within which to appeal for example from the decisions of the Federal Reserve Board. 
    That is to go in and review the decision of the Federal Reserve Board within a period of I think it was 10 or 12, 15 days after the Federal Reserve Board acted and before the 60-day appeal period had even substantially started to run, the Comptroller here issued a formal announcement saying, “I'm going to issue the charter to Whitney-Jefferson whenever they apply for it.” 
    Then we brought our suit and after the suit was filed and again before the 60-day period was out, he came in with an affidavit before the District Court saying that if -- “if the injunction in this case, the temporary restraining order is lifted, I intend immediately to charter Whitney-Jefferson” and as I say, Your Honor, once he charters Whitney-Jefferson, the game is over as far as the banks are concerned because no one can question that other than the Comptroller or perhaps the Attorney General who in this case were quo warranto -- quo warranto proceeding might do so. 
    But that's such a speculative remedy in most cases than no remedy here because the Attorney General has actually participated in representing and defending the Comptroller in this case.

    Well, what I'm getting at is why does it not -- why is it -- it is an error for the Court here to enjoin the opening of a bank while there is pending in the Court of the Fifth Circuit a motion for review and it has not been decided which if decided in your favor would have made any issuance of power to operate the bank on local.

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="5736.314" stopTime="5780.379">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    This is the end of the road and this should be the end of the road in our position because it was illegal from the beginning. 
    You see once Whitney decided and the expressed testimony has -- as set forth at page 14 and 15 of our brief shows that Whitney-New Orleans set out on this whole device from the very beginning knowing he had one purpose alone in mind and that is to evade and circumvent Section 30 (c) the provisions. 
    If this is allowed from the standpoint of the national interest, any bank in any state whether it'd be Illinois which has no branch banking or any other state, any big national bank or any little national bank that wants the branch now will simply form its own holding company, run its funds through and open the branch bank where it wanted to originally. 
    This is --

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible) have had proof for section for the enactment of the statute and again there is the charter in which the new bank holds it on. 
    They can have shortcut the statute and long after the court has stated that this Court --
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="5801.933" stopTime="5836.151">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Your Honor, it's absolutely correct. 
    I did overlook the fact that Illinois for example the state mention does have the Bank Holding Company Act which is to supplement the branch banking in order to prohibit the same things being done by a holding company. 
    But in a state, that doesn't have the Holding Company Act and only has the branch restrictions well, of course this would be a nice way to simply get around the law. 
    Change itself into a holding company, use your own funds and open the bank in a prohibited location, so that's the national interest question which is before this Court in this case. 
    It's not limited to our case or the State of Louisiana alone, it is a national interest question.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="5836.151" stopTime="5865.352">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Actually that before you answer the question. 
    Wouldn't there (Inaudible). 
    But the question really here is that Louisiana is not having been assigned that all this could close. 
    That they just have to go see with respect to the banks which in short has the bank holding which it can (Inaudible). 
    Isn't that the question?
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="5865.352" stopTime="5947.647">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    The question here is even more narrower than that because of course Whitney-Jefferson has not yet become a national bank it's simply a National Banking Association. 
    It has not gotten a charter, that's one of the purposes of the Act that -- I mean of this case that they'd be enjoined so that they cannot become a national bank. 
    So Louisiana confronted with a head on rush by a holding company to get into business and it was the only known holding company operation to even be organized or attempt to get in business in Louisiana. 
    The question here is whether Louisiana in the act of constitutional exercise of its police power can go one step further and say, “Before we let this lose” the beast, I think it was called by Mr. Spritzer, “the beast lose on the state, can we pay us an additional provision constitutionally and say that they cannot open for business and therefore stamp out before it gets started” and in Ferguson against Skrupa which this Court decided just recently, Kansas faced with debt adjusting business which it did not approve of, certainly have passed a law which outlawed debt adjusters, existing debt adjusters, and present debt adjusters are contemplated debt adjusters, and this Court held that there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment if Kansas found that that was in line with its public policy and also exercise that in line with its police powers.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Merrigan, what I'd like to know is this, why couldn't you on the direct review before the Court of Appeals have obtained adequate relief under this language. 
    Upon the filing of such petition the Court shall have jurisdiction to affirm, set aside or modify the order of the Board and to require the Board to take such action with regard to the matter under review as the Court deems proper. 
    The findings of the Board as to the facts have supported by substantial evidence so be conclusive. 
    Now, why couldn't you have gotten all the relief you're entitled to and why couldn't you have asked for it in that proceeding rather than to come here collaterally where this order could never be reviewed.
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="5997.749" stopTime="6016.393">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, Your Honor first we, let me give you the reasons in order as I understand them. 
    Number one, the question before the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit is not the question which is before the Court here and the questions before this Court really I don't think it properly be before the Court in the Fifth Circuit. 
    The question there is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6016.393" stopTime="6033.167">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So that's -- that's the danger of it, isn't it, that it is a direct review of the order that -- that you're complaining against and -- and in the Court of Appeals, you could have had that reviewed thoroughly and according to that broad language, couldn't you have obtained any relief to which you were entitled?
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="6033.167" stopTime="6182.491">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice because I think the Fifth Circuit could say quite properly that the question you raised that is whether this is an illegal branch under Section 36 is a question which should be litigated against the Comptroller who operates in a completely different procedure under a different statute to which the National Bank Act. 
    The only question to review in the Fifth Circuit is whether the decision of the Federal Reserve Board on the right of Whitney Holding Corporation to acquire the stock in the two proposed banks present city which I'll go -- wanted to talk about in a moment and the Whitney-Jefferson Bank was within the -- the statutory limits of their law to which the Federal Bank Holding Company Act. 
    You see we have before the Fifth Circuit only the holding corporation and only the Federal Reserve Board. 
    The Comptroller is not a party and therefore he would be less free to do anything he wanted to do in the interim. 
    If for any reason, we did not get to stay which would prevent the Comptroller in some way from issuing his certificate, the game would be over before the Fifth Circuit case could even be adjudicated, Your Honor, because the question is different, the parties are different and I think the question of the law involved is different. 
    That is procedures under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act, the procedure by the Comptroller under the National Bank Act. 
    So I don't think really and I don't want to -- in the light of the situation, say that there would be no question and no matter in which that Court could pass on these questions but I don't think and I know the government has been urging that they can't pass on those questions because in the proceedings in the Fifth Circuit, the government, the same attorneys who have been representing the Comptroller here, had told the Fifth Circuit that the Board must pay us on applications for the acquisition or establishment of subsidiaries without regard to state prohibitions against branch banking, and that's number one. 
    Then they sy none of the issues before this Court had been decided by the District Court for the District of Columbia and the only issue resolved by that Court is not before this Court. 
    Now, that was the government is telling the Fifth Circuit. 
    So I'm sort of like the poor country fellow who was caught in between one courts told, no jurisdiction because all this ought to be urged against the Comptroller and the other courts told, no you ought to go to the -- this Court, no don't come to the Comptroller, go talk to the Federal Reserve Board. 
    So we're in a position where we have no remedy if we're left that way. 
    I mean that's --

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="6265.389" stopTime="6297.570">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Yes, because I think the Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit is taking this position. 
    It has taken this position over a period of almost a year now or more that it should hold its case, its decision in the case until the final decision of this Court or the Court of Appeals whichever was to be final becomes final because I think as I think the Solicitor General, the Assistant Solicitor General as he admitted this morning that that case will really be moot if this case is upheld, if the Court of Appeal is upheld. 
    Now just as should not be a thing that he has thought of a game with chance.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, I -- well let me say this I -- I can certainly -- if -- if Mr. Spritzer didn't say that, I will say it myself, I misunderstood it that certainly the proceedings in the Fifth Circuit will be moot if the Court of Appeals or the District Court decision in this case that has upheld either one and quite frankly, if the -- if the thing involved is wrong, if the thing involved is unfair, if the thing involved is illegal, I don't think we should be put in the position of shuttled back and forth between courts on a -- in a -- in a state of no relief whatsoever because if you dismiss our case here, then we're left with a very, very dubious situation, Mr. Chief Justice, in the Fifth Circuit. 
    And if this plan gets into operation in the face of the Louisiana statute, in the face of Section 36 of the National Bank Act, Louisiana's public policy will be thwarted, the respondent banks have the unlawful competition unleashed upon them in Jefferson Parish, and the possibilities for the other states in the United States are just a big question of low because then any other bank so desiring to get out into an illegal location will consider the possibility as put here that well worn possibility of circumventing the laws through the holding company.

speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="6382.888" stopTime="6434.059">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    There are two issues here if you can believe the government's own brief. 
    Number one, whether or not a national bank knowing that it is prohibited by law, Section 36 of the National Bank Act from branching to a prohibited location promoting an office in a prohibited location can with the company and with the help of the Comptroller of the Currency who considers the end personally desirable to him simply form of synthetic holding corporation through which he can put its own fund and often at the illegal prohibited location through the holding company device, that's number one. 
    The government says that the Court in the Fifth Circuit has no right to look at the branching restriction, that it has to look only at the things that are set out in the statute, the injury to competition, the public interest involved all those things.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Whether -- whether it wouldn't be the very good question because there's no case on that subject and Congress has not chosen to so provide but the -- certainly Section 36 of the National Bank Act administered exclusively by the Comptroller, Your Honors. 
    The Federal Reserve Board has no jurisdiction for a moment over Section 36. 
    It has no jurisdiction at all on the National Bank Act for that matter and I think the first person who would be complaining bitterly if the Federal Reserve Board tried to seek an administration of the National Bank Act would be Comptroller Saxon himself.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Merrigan, in -- in the Fifth Circuit since the Board -- between the time the Board acted in the case at the Fifth Circuit, Louisiana changed this law, didn't it?
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="6484.278" stopTime="6486.309">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Louisiana changed its law right after the case --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6486.309" stopTime="6514.492">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The case is public policy, right after the Board acted. 
    And lets assume that it hasn't even added Section 5 on to the Act then there would have been a flat provision in Louisiana against the acquisition of this bank, isn't that true, under the new law? 
    If that law had been in existence prior to the Board's action of course, the -- the approval would have, that could have issued?

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Well, I think that would certainly be a proper position to take with the Federal Reserve Board regarding the stock acquisition phases of the case. 
    But I think it's also a perfectly good legal position to take against the Comptroller who is charged by law only to license lawful operations and I think it's a perfectly good position to take here and I think with -- I think the court below was absolutely correct.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    We have two positions basically, Your Honor.

    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    Now, the Louisiana statute simply supplements the branching provisions of the State of Louisiana and it's the second question raised by this case, Your Honor which is that it's also unlawful for the Comptroller to -- to issue a certificate licensing the opening of a completely directly illegal operation. 
    That's what the District Court rule judgment brought in and then of course the Court of Appeals said, “Well, this was illegal from the very beginning, you should not have even started.”

    The Fourteenth Amendment and they say it denies them equal protection and of course we say to that, that it does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment and we cite Ferguson against Skrupa as the most recent decision. 
    We say this law was enacted within the police powers of Louisiana. 
    We also say it doesn't deny them equal protection because it applies to all holding company, to all bank subsidiaries, all banks equally. 
    The fact that Whitney is the only one that tried to get into the holding company business and it's thus the only holding company as its fault not the state.

    They did not have the charter?
speaker="edward_l_merrigan" startTime="6728.292" stopTime="6903.146">
    Mr. Edward L. Merrigan 
    That's correct because they were not even a national bank at that point. 
    Your Honor, in a few moments which are remaining to me, I would like to just say this that the dispute against the Comptroller Saxon in this case that the Comptroller of the Currency starts on these grounds. 
    Number one, he met with Whitney-New Orleans from the very beginning here in Washington before they even put the plan into operation and sat down with them and advised and consented with them on -- on how they could really get a bank open in Jefferson Parish. 
    Number two, the first step in this whole plan was to take $350,000 of money out of Whitney-New Orleans to buy stock in the Whitney Holding Corporation. 
    Section 24 of the National Bank Act makes it illegal for a national bank to use its funds to purchase stock of any corporation. 
    The Comptroller approved it knowing well that that was an illegal step. 
    The second step of this complicated transaction involved the formation of what the Federal Reserve Board called a phantom bank Crescent City National Bank of New Orleans. 
    The purpose of that bank was one thing only, to eliminate all dissenting stockholders under Section 215 of the National Bank Act because under that section if a dissenting stockholder doesn't go along with the merger of that phantom bank with the Bank of New Orleans, his stock can be appraised and he can be bought out. 
    This was step number two looking toward a complete unitary type of operation. 
    Step number three was to take $650,000 out of the Bank of New Orleans and run it through the holding company. 
    All of those Sections 1845 of Title XII a provision of the Federal Bank Holding Company Act say that a bank shall not invest its funds in any of the securities of a holding company, shall not lend any money to a holding company, shall not engage in upstream finances. 
    So here's number three, the steps of the Comptroller has approved. 
    Finally, we get down to the end of the line and he's going to charter this thing in Jefferson Parish in violation of Section 36. 
    So I complained here, he goes before the Federal Reserve Board under Section 1842 of Title XII, gives his approval to this whole plan and therefore obviates the public hearing on it in Louisiana, the statutory hearing where there could be crossed examination and so forth. 
    So we're litigating against the right end in the right court. 
    The suit against the Federal Reserve Board when they -- when they went to the Comptroller during the course of their proceedings and said look, the minority stockholders of Whitney-Jefferson who will be squeezed out on this thing, what's your advise as to why this might be in circumvention of the National Bank Act which you administer? 
    He refused to comment on it. 
    So we find and felt here, Your Honor -- feeling that the Court of Appeals was eminently correct and perfectly correct in every respect and we feel also that the District Court was correct in upholding the Louisiana Act. 
    But on either ground we think we're entitled to judgment of an -- of an affirmance. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Ralph S. Spritzer
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="6903.146" stopTime="6994.532">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    I heard about the matter of interim relief. 
    In the first place, I would stress that what the District of Columbia courts have done is not to attempt to maintain a status quo pending an adjudication in the Fifth Circuit. 
    The action before them was for a permanent injunction restraining the Comptroller at anytime from issuing this last document of title which this national bank needed in order to open up. 
    So far as remedy pendente lite is concerned, it seems to me perfectly clear that if we are right in our view that the objections which are being made in this case should have been made before the Fifth Circuit, that the Court of Appeals for that circuit would have the power to do anything that was necessary or appropriate to maintain the status quo while the matter was pending before it. 
    Nor I think is there any likelihood that if there were any indication that the Court of Appeals was concerned about possible precipitant action by the Comptroller nor is there any likelihood that he would take such action pending review in the Fifth Circuit.

    Sometimes I remember when I was in the government, they acted predictably and I mean, is that it, asserting perhaps you might get an injunction, so is there any merit for that, I suppose it would be best to prohibit for it to have stay.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="7065.716" stopTime="7067.488">

speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="7067.488" stopTime="7074.266">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Is there any merit from the proposition that should be a stay, well perhaps this Court should take to some action.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="7074.266" stopTime="7127.644">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    I don't question that this Court had concluded that the injunction of the Court of Appeals was improperly issued but also concluded that the matter should be held in advance until the Fifth Circuit completed its review that it could issue an appropriate direction. 
    The case with its conclusion I think comes back to the beginning point and that is that the basis of the complaint in this case is that the Board, well the basis of it stems from the fact that this bank which Whitney and Chris proposed to open is owned by a holding company. 
    Now, if that ownership is objectionable for any reason it seems to me that it must be that the Federal Reserve Board has improperly performed its function in approving the relationship.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="7127.644" stopTime="7132.925">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Did they complain of the violation, an alleged violation of the National Banking Act?
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="7132.925" stopTime="7268.795">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes. 
    But to get to that Your Honor they have to say that this is a branch in -- they are really not prepared to say that because you can't say that. 
    It's obviously a holding company relationship so what they say in effect and I'm going to quote what they said to the Fifth Circuit, this is the brief of the respondent banks in the Fifth Circuit. 
    They say a respondent, and they're talking about the Federal Reserve Board, has knowingly permitted the use of the Bank Holding Company Act to provide national banks with an artifice to evade regulatory state and federal laws. 
    Now, if -- if they are right, if the bank holding company has been abused and this holding company is somehow illegitimate in its conception or in its proposed operations then I should think it's inescapable that the appraisal of the claim that the holding company is improper certainly must be for the only agency which is authorized to pass on a holding company relationship and I think the very arguments they make here emphasize that. 
    For example, Your Honors were told that this was a violation of the -- this acquisition would be anti competitive in its effects. 
    Well, the Board has directed to pass upon competition. 
    Your Honors were told that the source of the funds was improper. 
    The source of the funds was actually undivided profits which were free monies and available to the payment of dividends instead of paying the dividends out and the shareholders then subscribing them a new, these free monies were paid directly into Whitney Holding Company but if that were a violation of any provision of law, it would be a violation of Section 6 of the Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board is supposed to enforce that Act, so that I think all of the issues which are presented if there is any merit to them which I'm not conceding are issues for the Federal Reserve Board alone.

    (Voice Overlap) why does the case at bar that certain end whether this Act was passed on Louisiana, it was admitted to express its hostility questionable to the attorney of the state, this holding of one of his counsel (Inaudible). 
    Why would did it bar them to take whether that is constitutional or because it -- it has forbidden it -- has been expressed to pass the law which the Congress has said unfair, unless for some reason about the Constitution.

    Well yes, but in the ultimate sense it certainly is.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Well, I would still question the remedy of an injunction against the Comptroller. 
    I would think that the -- whether in the light of the Louisiana Act, this relationship should have been approved or to have been presented in the first instance to the Reserve Board because all the Comptroller does is to determine whether a bank is qualified under the provisions of the National Bank Act, he makes some examination and the determination of formal qualifications. 
    He doesn't pass upon issues of state law --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7412.809" stopTime="7425.515">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Spritzer, if Section 7 authorizes a statute including this Section 5 provision, can the Board in any event approve this acquisition?

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Well, I would -- what I was suggesting was that the Board, I would suppose that the Board in the first instance rather than the Comptroller would make the initial decision as to whether the action it proposed to take was forbidden by any other provision of law. 
    If the Board arguably urge then that issue could be taken up on appeal. 
    I don't see that the effect of the Louisiana law was an issue before the Comptroller or that it is properly an issue before a suit to enjoin the Comptroller from issuing a certificate under the Bank Act.

    Well, you may be right. 
    And perhaps, the most properly blown to the Fifth Circuit so to speak but it's a little unusual isn't it if we were to conclude that Section 7 did authorize Section 5 and this is an absolute prohibition.

    If Your Honors were to conclude that the Louisiana Act forbad could properly invalidly forbid the opening of the bank, I'm sure that regardless of what kind of an order were entered that that would be the end of this proposal by Whitney Bank because I would have to say, it would attempt to open in that circumstance. 
    As to the legal argument we make in relation to the Louisiana Act, it is grounded as our brief elaborates upon the claim that with respect to the organization, operation, and establishment of national banks, the Banking Act occupies the field. 
    That is not to deny the possibility that the Louisiana might even go so far as to direct the shareholders that is the holding company to divest itself of its interest in this national bank. 
    It is to argue that the state has no authority under the Bank Act to prevent the opening of a chartered national bank order require its closing.
