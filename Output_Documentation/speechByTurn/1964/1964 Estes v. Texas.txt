Estes v. Texas

    Number 256, Billie Sol Estes, petitioner versus Texas. 
    Mr. Cofer.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    May it please Your Honor and members of the Court. 
    The Estes case is a case which has given rise to consideration for this Court a very important question. 
    The few times I've been before this Court, I always feel humbled. 
    If Plutarch said, great men must be born in famous cities and maybe enough lawyers must have famous clients and so my claim gentlemen is possibly my famous client. 
    Mr. Estes was indicted in the state court on a three-count indictment and he was convicted of swindling. 
    The effect of the charge was that he had induced a farmer to sign a note and he was paid, the farmer was 10% of what proceeded from the note would realize for signing that and that Mr. Estes by misrepresentations that secured possession of that instrument which was property on the facts it was not a particularly strong case as presented in courts. 
    The important thing and the thing that this Court is interested in and has limited its review is this matter of photography and TV in the courtroom and the standards as expressed by Canon 35 and the standards which have been recognized in the federal courts in Rule 53. 
    The briefs of the state present the natural question. 
    Well they took his picture in the courtroom, so what? 
    Why make a federal case out of it and when I say that I use it in a slang meaning that the dictionary of slang says hold the emphasis that judiciary code says invasion of a federal right makes a federal case. 
    When counsel read in the paper that it was contemplated that this case would be televised, counsel didn't feel that they could bring their client into the courtroom to answer the charges against him. 
    They asked permission of the Court to appear without their counsel to protest the TV. 
    Certainly, it would --

    This was when the case was called for trial.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="227.330" stopTime="233.997">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well do I understand though that on this record, something happened for two days in September --
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="233.997" stopTime="234.186">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes.

speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="236.480" stopTime="380.523">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes, yes sir. 
    The case was called to trial and the case was continued. 
    What I had reference to Your Honor was that when he -- his case has said the defendant is under bond, he has to appear in court. 
    This defendant was unwilling to appear in court because of the television vans in front of the courthouse because he was to be publicized to the world as a man who stole $20 million. 
    Defendant's due process should include it seems to me the right of the defendant to appear in court and answer to the charges and that those things that interfere with and in the opinion of his counsel would injure him in his appearance, raise serious questions of invasion of the defendant's rights. 
    We must remember that a defendant is presumed to be innocent and he may not Your Honors be treated as if he were guilty. 
    He doesn't become a public character whose picture can be broadcast to the world. 
    He stands just as the ordinary citizen, the right to sit in his home and not have photographers come and take his picture. 
    The right to go to business and not to have them come in his office, the right as an innocent man to appear in court and not have his suit that he wears, his shoes that he wears publicized to the entire world and those things which bear no reasonable relation to the determination of his innocence or his guilt are not a legitimate part of the judicial process.

speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="663.975" stopTime="757.668">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Well prior to then -- to the October trial when the case was -- actually the trial the court issued release to press in which he defined the rules and the television was confined to a booth in the rear of the courtroom. 
    It was a special built booth. 
    The color of the plywood walls was approximately the color of the courtroom. 
    There was a space about that, a foot-and-a-half wide, that some three to six cameras protruded. 
    There were directional mics, there -- people with silent cameras were permitted to stay in the courtroom and if they took no flashlights were permitted to take the pictures during the trial. 
    They actually didn't broadcast the testimony of the interrogation of the jurors and picking the venire or the witnesses, because it was -- an effort was honestly made that witnesses outside the courtroom wouldn't know what the witnesses in the courtroom and as all witnesses were under rule had testified to, then each night wide, well during the day and during the trial were these scenes broadcast and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="757.668" stopTime="764.231">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    [Inaudible] the fact that they didn't have a live telecast while a witness was on the stand.
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="764.231" stopTime="764.592">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="764.592" stopTime="772.909">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But nevertheless was the witnesses' testimony being recorded from that booth in the rear of the courtroom that the model showed.

    By who?

    Not by counsel.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    No, there was -- oh no, not by counsel, no. 
    Not by anybody who had taken an oath Your Honor and I might as well say that the press, this idea that their right to be present even in this Court and to take pictures. 
    Suppose the press was required to hold up their right hand and say, “we swear that we will truthfully report the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth of this trial,” we would have hell to high heaven on the First Amendment of the Constitution and it's the lack of juridical legitimacy that makes the press irresponsible from the legal standpoint, that makes the TV irresponsible. 
    They have no judicial function to perform because all of us are under oaths, the reporter is under oath. 
    Everything a person has something to do puts an oath, but the First Amendment says, these people can report what occurs. 
    The defendant is not entitled even to a fair reporting, not even an honest reporting of his case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="883.745" stopTime="886.508">

    Well what you're saying now applies to journalist generally.

    Oh, it applies to all of them.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In fact there is more to journalism than does to what happened here because here was at least a -- it couldn't be a -- an accurate portrayal of what actually went on and there was no room for misreporting here, wasn't it?

    This typifies Your Honor, I saw it for the first time yesterday, it typifies TV because it idealizes the courtroom scene and TV attempts to do that. 
    For example, I notice the counsel at the table representing the defendant. 
    As it happened, all three of the counsels were decidedly bald. 
    This gives them all three a very beautiful head of hair and I suppose that's TV's on the stateside here that well you should have a fine head of hair, at least they make a better image on television.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Well I just [Attempt to Laughter] my only point was that Your Honor and perhaps it was not particularly well taken, was that television has a tendency to idealize the courtroom. 
    For example it has been suggested that it'd be a great thing that this Court could have its proceedings televised, but Your Honors couldn't wear black robes because it's notorious. 
    That black creates a very poor image in television. 
    You would have to wear blue robes.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    No sir. 
    My point is that in a trial court, any procedure which doesn't by some reasonable relation to termination of a guilt or innocence of the accused is a matter which the defendant has the right to object to.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1051.760" stopTime="1054.079">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You were saying and the defendant has a right --

    That's right.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    That's my point exactly.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That is your point.
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="1060.152" stopTime="1155.514">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes sir. 
    I don't think that if he didn't object that is necessary, it could become fundamental error as in Rideau versus Louisiana. 
    Why it was so -- such a terrible travesty on justice and your -- this Court granted it, but I don't say this is a Rideau case. 
    I say that the defendant makes the objection. 
    Now who has a right to make that decision? 
    It is suggested by the state that we do it by experiment, that we go through a system of experiments and determine whether or not television actually causes prejudice. 
    Gentlemen, Your Honors, in deciding what should be done in his client's case, the attorney for the defendant's opinion is supreme. 
    It transcribes even the rights of the Court itself because he has a responsibility of determining whether this is going to damage his client's case and my clients Your Honor are not going to be if I can help it, the victims of an empirical decision on the use of television.

speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="1174.046" stopTime="1211.480">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Your Honor, I have some very definite ideas on that. 
    I don't think the right of free speech and I will also address my margin to the senior justice, where the right of press is hard and right to a fair trial. 
    I believe that the purpose of free speech and free press is to ensure a fair trial and it's as just as Professor Charles Black said, it's a question of the school of the particular right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1211.480" stopTime="1221.726">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well then (Voice Overlap) you do think that if a defendant's lawyer if he objected to keep the newspaper man out of the courtroom during a trial?
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="1221.726" stopTime="1254.744">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    He can't prevent under the First Amendment the right of the people to know so that they can talk about the trial. 
    The right to know is part of the right of free speech and the lawyer has no right to rule out the public and though the Constitution guarantees it and that I don't contend that the right to a public trial was not part of the general public's right to come in and watch the trial. 
    The defendants criticize --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1254.744" stopTime="1279.891">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I still don't -- I'm not sure that I understand the answer to your question if you've given it to me. 
    You just -- you told us a few minutes ago that the decision of defense counsel is paramount to everything else in a criminal case. 
    Now if defense counsel thought that it would help his client's cause to exclude all newspaper men from the trial, would that -- would his objection in your judgment prevail over everything else?
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="1279.891" stopTime="1405.588">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    I don't think so Your Honor because I don't think that his objection would be based upon reasonable grounds and as we brief this question, the right to object, we say that defendant's right to object in this case is based upon certain reasonable grounds which we outline some seven of them and I think they must be reasonable grounds. 
    Your Honor, it has been held that the defendant can demand a closed trial, but I am rather -- feel and I felt even before Singer versus United States has reason to say that that's not a right of the defendant to demand that he had a closed trial. 
    I don't think of that, so I don't argue with that, but I do say that these techniques of reporting which in the opinion of the lawyer interferes with fair trial and what are these things? 
    In the first place, it lowers the dignity of the courtroom, the use of the television. 
    But after all, dignity doesn't -- there's nothing in the Constitution that says the Court has to be dignified, at least I don't remember it in one of the first ten Amendments or in the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    There is nothing in that, that says you can't take pictures and not even ten times, I guess they knew about ten times from the Constitution, but what is it that makes this part of due process? 
    The defendants say that they disagree with the statement that has been made by in an article by a member of this Court, that the limitation of a public trial, so as to prevent the highest and largest number of people to hear it and see it that if that position is taken, they disagree with the justice.

    The problem here was that the lawyers had the feeling that this taking the pictures back there behind them was detracting them from the trial. 
    Now the state has filed affidavits of every member of the juror in this case and we've made no objection that it didn't interfere with them in trying this case and I read those affidavits of interest. 
    The -- well the significant thing about one of the affidavits was that they said that the thing that really interfered with the trial was Mr. Cofer, the attorney for the defendant continually objecting to what was going on and making them go out so that they couldn't see and hear but [Inaudible] the trial.

    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    That's right. 
    Now there again Your Honor, I want to bring Your Honors back to our position that it is not actual prejudice but if you're going to adopt a rule of procedure permitting television then you're going to have to say all juries must be impounded or they'll watch television. 
    So are we going to adopt the rule in Texas and Colorado, the rule in Texas and Colorado and apply it to federal courts and to all the other 48 states of the union and say, you've got to lock your juries up because they might watch television. 
    So it's not exactly lock. 
    Your Honor, one of the things that affects the fairness of the trial is the attitude with which the lawyer approaches it. 
    I know as early as 1951, Judge Arnold wrote an article in Atlantic Monthly in which he watched the Costello hearing and he said that public trial doesn't mean that the trail can be used as an instrument for publicity. 
    That idea has been the idea of making a theater out of the courtroom, there were also things that deny a fair trial that you can't demonstrate to actual prejudice. 
    For example, I spoke of robes, courts, as a matter of judicial rules, wear robes but suppose the judge doesn't wear the robe, can I say well he has denied a due process. 
    The judge didn't wear a robe. 
    The Court was open with a prayer. 
    Suppose they don't open the courtroom with a prayer. 
    Have I been denied due process? 
    I don't think so, but those things which affect the defendant's idea and his counsel idea that this man's basic rights of innocence are being violated in that he is being published throughout the world as a guilty man and --

    Why is this -- why does the televising of this trial make anybody think he was less entitled to the ordinary procedural safeguards of a defendant, that is the presumption and so on than the trial had not been televised, that's my question.
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2310.402" stopTime="2322.301">
    Mr. John D. Cofer

speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2327.216" stopTime="2370.818">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    No, Your Honor, I don't think that follows, because conventional reporting, the newspapers come in, they take down what is said, they report it later, that doesn't have the same psychological barrier which you have in the use of TV which dramatizes the situation and which makes it impossible for the defendant and his counsel unless they are willing to descend to violation of Canons on which they believe.

    Is that it? 
    For entertainment or a performance but not in the trial?
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2389.115" stopTime="2887.970">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    And you take a lawyer who has to take the responsibility of -- well not televising my client, will it or will it not hurt my client. 
    Well all said if he says to himself, I'll get my picture in the television and we'll try and see if it hurts my client. 
    That's not the decision that a lawyer makes. 
    A lawyer -- it's the appearance to ethics of his profession Your Honor that enables a lawyer to form a foundation upon which he can evaluate his service to his client and if he violates those ethics, that's accepted by the bar association to which he belongs, then he makes it impossible for himself to judge himself as competent counsel for his client. 
    So he doesn't make an empirical decision. 
    He makes an intuitive one. 
    This is wrong. 
    My fellow lawyers think it's wrong and I am not going to permit it, not on my client, let them experiment with somebody else's client if he's willing to be experimented with. 
    Now that is a serious question. 
    Now, I think that this isn't an interference with federalism. 
    Justice Stewart said that sound federalism, I may not repeat it exactly, seeks to get uniformity and not conflict between the state and the federal systems. 
    Judge Frankfurter said that this Court doesn't sit here to impose the federal rules on state courts and I recognize that. 
    But here, we have a rule not Canon 35 but a standard of conduct in the courtroom which is accepted by 48 states and even in Texas and Colorado, is accepted in all but the trial courts. 
    I say that true federalism is better served by a uniform rule such as the Court adopted in Gideon versus Wainwright rather than leaving to every case in Texas and Colorado, a determination by the Federal Court either this Court or another Federal Court whether or not there was really prejudice in that case. 
    When you can prohibit the prejudice by providing a rule that will require Texas and Colorado to comply with the other 48 states. 
    Then there is no other effective way of controlling television or preventing what has occurred so many times when courts have tried to control it by rule. 
    Of course this Court has held you can't do it by contempt. 
    Canon 28 of Texas says that the judges had gone together and agreed that they will fix certain rules for televising and that if anybody violates that rule or criticizes it in an editorial, then the judge shall fine that person for contempt. 
    I don't think that violates antitrust law, but it at least is going [Attempt to Laughter] to be difficult to get this Court to sustain a contempt for a newspaperman that says, “Well, I don't like this rule that this judge has provided in his court about the television.” 
    You can't do it by inter-media and Bar Association cooperation, because the media just doesn't think that they should be restrained from saying what they please. 
    And they have the right under the First Amendment to say what they think and please. 
    So, the only practical way of insuring a fair trial is a uniformity of rule which would prohibit television. 
    Now on the question of whether it interferes with freedom of the press and freedom of speech, the Valente case, and Even cases held that the freedom of speech doesn't include the right to discover things and I don't entirely agree with that. 
    I think that if you just have the right to talk but don't have the right to find out some it would be disgusting and [Inaudible]. 
    And in the same way, the Sixth Amendment doesn't say that anybody but the defendants should be entitled a public trial, but that doesn't mean that the public can't come and watch the trial, but it doesn't mean that you've got to make it possible for the whole world to hear about it. 
    And the distinguished Attorney General of Texas is eminent trial counsel, Assistant District Attorney General. 
    I do not believe or take the position that public trial means make it possible for just as many people as possible to hear it. 
    They indicate that in their brief, but they're speaking as advocates and in the archives in the history of our state both [Inaudible] on the records of contrary and they were speaking then for the archives and not as advocates. 
    I don't like to talk about balancing because I have read so many cases and I'm not entirely in the court with the rules of balancing. 
    I read Nickel John, I read Chaffy. 
    I have read Sutherland's opinions and I read Justice Black's opinions and I believe that freedom of the press includes a right to discover and find out what to talk about, but I don't believe as this Court held in Cox versus Louisiana that this right of petition and this right to speak includes the right to interfere with the processes of the courts. 
    And I think that in determining that if it's not a matter of just procedure, but it's a matter which may affect the fairness of the trial, that the attorney gets into possession that I have seen recently reported to by opinion of our Circuit and I don't pass on correctness of this position. 
    It was decided by en banc in the Fifth Circuit that the attorney for the government could not be required against his conscience to sign indictment or prepare an indictment had been returned by grand jury. 
    Then can a lawyer who is defending an accused be required to submit his client to having his picture taken and the danger that may occur as a result of the character of trial. 
    I don't believe that freedom of the press means that it is to be made possible that the guilt and innocence of the accused is to be determined in the marketplace.

speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2893.530" stopTime="2917.157">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    By the fact that the people could see parts of this televised and reported by monitoring and didn't see at all and we're forming opinions about the guilt of this and regardless of that even if he'd been acquitted. 
    The Court would say well there's bunch of rascals, it recently occurred in a recent – [Inaudible] let me illustrate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2917.157" stopTime="2927.191">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, let me -- let me just pursue my question for a moment. 
    You said that you implied that what happened here remitted the guilt of this man to be determined not by the jury but in the marketplace.
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2927.191" stopTime="2927.994">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2927.994" stopTime="2932.443">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I wanted to apply that it wasn't made possible in this case. 
    As I understand it, the jury was --
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2932.443" stopTime="2933.139">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2933.139" stopTime="2935.410">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- the jury was sequestered in the case, were they not?
speaker="john_d_cofer" startTime="2935.410" stopTime="3223.533">
    Mr. John D. Cofer 
    Yes sir. 
    But before that jury was sequestered, all of those people who saw the first two days, not all of them but at large number of them saw the first day's broadcast. 
    In that broadcast, they were told of the things this man was accused of. 
    They were shown parts that somebody not sworn had monitored and picked out and put in this two-hour broadcast and they were passing on in advance, is this man is guilty. 
    Just the press can do that Your Honor, but they have a right to do it, but you have the right to object to a thing so broadly done as it's done with TV. 
    The educational purposes of television and even the press are incidental and the television is not equipped to do it fairly. 
    It cost too much money. 
    Probably only five or six cases a year are televised. 
    They're not televised unless they are famous defendants. 
    They can't spend have 15 men in attendance as the record shows they had here and spend $150,000 in the ordinary case. 
    So, the television itself is not equipped to do what these people say we want to do and the lawyer knows that. 
    It's recent, it's a matter of public knowledge and it's recent as this trial. 
    There was a complete report of about how he misstated his liabilities to the government. 
    They put it in full for two days of the testimony of the government. 
    The defendant for the first time went on the trial and gave his case and told the newspapers didn't mention and Dallas didn't mention the case that day, they just ignored it. 
    One of the paper over in Fort Worth said that this was the first time he'd be on the stand in the three cases and two of which he'd been convicted. 
    The court was required to call in all the jurors, they were not sequestered in the Federal Court and ask each one of them, did you read this article about him not -- but they didn't tell what it was, but what they've said that he had not testified in any other case, his reference to his exercise of his constitutional rights. 
    Of course, the jury said they hadn't read it. 
    So the court sent the -- they didn't discharge the jury and the jury went out after the argument and acquitted Mr. Estes. 
    But are we going to permit the television to broadcast as a trial they see so that the Court will have to come in and interrogate the jurors or lock them up, interrogate him as they did in our -- in the Kopitch case and the cases where the cases were reversed because the judge didn't interrogate the juror and asked them about what they heard or what they saw on television. 
    So, the only practical means of enforcing this rule of fair trial and a standard of procedure is by extending it to Texas and Colorado and create a uniformity in the treatment of cases. 
    Now, it's not going to be a great amount of infringement upon freedom of speech since the case is due to any other state except Texas and Colorado anyways. 
    It's not going to infringe freedom of speech and say, “well now, you can't do it in Texas and you can't do it in Colorado.” 
    That's not going to hurt freedom of speech and freedom of press. 
    I think the part that is overlooked, the experiments suggested here by the defendant, the empirical approach, let the bench, bar and media try out some cases or so. 
    Well, if they will just say let the defendant be a part of that and determine whether or not he wanted to be experimented on, then there would be no serious objections. 
    It would violate my sense of propriety, but I'm not always sure that I'm right on my adherence to Canon 35. 
    Your Honor, I'll proceed -- I will not proceed further now, but my associate will use the few minutes we have left in rebuttal.

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices. 
    In the very beginning in this case including the filing of the briefs, there has been a great deal of misunderstanding as we see it as to the actual facts in this case. 
    And if you will permit me, I would like to pick what time is necessary in the time that I have here to go into the facts in a chronological order so that I might be sure the Court understands everything that's happened. 
    Now we're willing to be judged on the facts, but we certainly want the facts well known. 
    May I pull one fact out of context here due to the questions placed from the bench today and make it clear to the Court that no part of the testimony of any witness was recorded, no part of it was ever recorded and that none of it was recorded for later playback during the trial, the broadcast people, the radio people voir dire if they so desire sit in the audience, take notes, go out and make comments on later broadcast.

    May I ask you when you get to it if you will. 
    How much the participants in the trial, witnesses, jurors, counsel, judge, knew of actually what was going on and the limitation you just mentioned namely that there was no actual recording of the testimony. 
    How much do they know of with regards of this case in the trial?

    Well, I might say to you that of course the judge gave them the right to televise under his instructions that is to take film without sound is very specific. 
    He ordered them to take all of the pictures during the trial on its merits from the booth but nowhere else and I'm going to bring this out in the argument I think.

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    Sir, that's all I think, yes sir. 
    Now sir, if I might say, a moment ago it was suggested that all of the facts are agreed upon. 
    This is correct. 
    In each case, the bill of exceptions would be presented by Mr. Cofer. 
    They would be read and qualified by the Court and then in every instance, Mr. Cofer would agree to the qualifications of the Court. 
    So what you have is an agreed statement of facts. 
    I'm going to try to state these to you very quickly. 
    You'll also find them in the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, which is the highest court in Texas in criminal matters and a portion of this appears on page 136 and 137 of the record on file on this Court. 
    Now, this case was set for trial in the beginning on September 24, 1962. 
    On September the 24th and the next day, the 25th, a pretrial hearing was held by the trial court on two motions, two motions that were filed by the petitioner. 
    One motion was that no telecast of the trial be permitted and the other motion was for continuance. 
    At the conclusion of this hearing, the trial court overruled the petitioner's motion that the trial not be telecast and granted the motion for a continuance and reset the trial for October 22nd about a month later, 1962, due to the absence of certain defendant's witnesses. 
    Now, the trial court permitted live telecast of the pretrial proceedings on these two motions. 
    However, there was not any evidence nor was there any testimony offered on the merits of the case. 
    The only testimony offered was in support of the defendant's motion to prevent telecasting, broadcasting by radio or press photography. 
    There was no testimony offered on the motion for a continuance other than the mere calling of the witnesses' names and the filing of the motion. 
    I would like to point out to this Court that practically all of the complaints heard from counsel or the petitioner and various of the amici curiae briefs are related to this pretrial hearing before the judge, which determined only those two matters of procedure and the preliminary matters did not in any manner include any evidence or even any statement by counsel as to the pertinent facts in the case since it was not to be tried at this particular time nor was any comment made as to the guilt or the innocence of the defendant. 
    Now, I would like to specifically point out to this Court's attention that on page 63 of the record, you will find testimony by Mr. Hume Cofer, co-counsel for the petitioner, concerning the petitioner's objection to the presence of cameras in the courtroom. 
    Mr. Cofer expressly admitted under oath at that time that this televised pretrial hearing gave no prospective juror any knowledge about the facts of this case nor any knowledge of any of the evidence. 
    This was under oath by Mr. Cofer himself, page 63 of the record. 
    The record bears out also that Judge Dunagan's statement, who was the trial judge, which appears on page 106 of the record filed herein that “prospective jurors and others in the Smith County or any other place did not learn anymore than they already knew and they didn't learn anymore from the TV and radio and they had learned from the press which was that the defendant had been brought to Smith County for trial, that the trial was called or the case was called rather, that the defendant had filed a motion to exclude cameras, that he had filed a motion for continuance and that the witnesses' names were recalled and the numbers were missing.”

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    He was there during the latter part, yes, not all the time, but they're part of the time. 
    Now counsel for the petitioner does not claim these facts to be any different in the record than what I've stated to you right here. 
    Now if you would allow me, I would like to read Judge Dunagan's statement appearing on page 34 of the record and I quote. 
    “In the past, it has been the policy of this court to permit televising in the courtroom under the rules and the supervision of this court.” 
    Heretofore, I have not encountered any difficulty with it. 
    I was unable to observe any detraction from the witnesses or the attorneys in those cases” and then I continue to quote, “I had the privilege yesterday morning of sitting in my home and viewing the sermon by the First Baptist Church over in Dallas and certainly, it wasn't any circus in that church and I feel that if any television, is a proper instrument in the house of the Lord, it is not out of place in this courtroom if properly supervised.” 
    And then in denying the petitioner's motion to exclude television, Judge Dunagan said this and I thought this would be of interest to the Court. 
    “There has been one consideration that the court has given and it is that this is a small courtroom and there will be hundreds of people trying to get into this courtroom to witness this trial.”

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    And I'll begin over here. 
    “There was one consideration that the court has given and it is that this is a small courtroom and there will be hundreds of people trying to get into this courtroom to witness this trial. 
    I believe we would have less confusion if they would stay at home and stay out of the courtroom and look in on the trial with all of those people trying to crowd in and push into this courtroom that is another consideration I have given to it, meaning television.” 
    Now prior to the merits of the case which began on the trial on the merits, the court case was continued until October 22nd. 
    On the first day, October 22nd, again they went into these preliminary matters so they didn't get to any of the merits on the 22nd. 
    But prior to the 22nd, there was booth constructed and placed in the rear of the courtroom which was painted the same or near the same color as the courtroom with a small opening across the top for the use of cameras. 
    Now you have before you state's Exhibit 8 which is a part of the record here. 
    This is a photograph of this booth as it actually existed. 
    That depicts the physical appearance of the booth upon the convening of court at 9 am. on October 23rd, which condition continued and remained the same throughout the trial. 
    Now this was the date and the time of day that the jury panel reported for duty and voir dire of the jury panel began. 
    I would like if I might to direct the Court's attention to the model behind me, I'm not sure how good you can see it but you will have it before you from now on, that includes the camera booth that was constructed and we wanted to have this for you, because we thought it might be easier for you to see even just by the description of words. 
    If I might --

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    Yes sir, right here. 
    Now we have -- I don't know whether you can hear me sir, if you can't, I'll be glad to accept it, we have made this part here removable so that you might better see it. 
    This is drawn on a direct scale of 3/4 of an inch to a foot. 
    Now this is in our opinion, a very near replica and you have a certification for that effect by the people who made -- made it of the exact courtroom. 
    This is the way the courtroom appeared at the time of the pretrial on September 24th and 25th before the booth was constructed. 
    At that time, these two -- between the 24th and 25th of September and a month later when the trial actually started on its merits, two of these seats here were removed and placed upfront in the courtroom where they had plenty of room and this booth was constructed as you can see there and placed there the same color as the rest of the courtroom with a little aperture opening across the top, where the cameras could view the courtroom, but everything would be behind the wall of the petitioner. 
    Now on the 23rd, the judge calls to be placed in this aperture a further closing of it, because he found that the cameras could operate there, all right, and still he could close off any activity that might be behind the wall of the booth so as to be sure or surer that nothing occurred that would prevent a fair trial. 
    Now, if I might put this around just a little one other -- one other thing. 
    You've heard a lot about microphones, this is an exact replica of the microphone. 
    There were six microphones in that courtroom. 
    There are 10 here in your courtroom. 
    Three of those courtroom microphones are on the judges desks. 
    Three were on the witnesses' desk or the witnesses' chair right before him. 
    This is a modern courtroom as you can see, but it's much like the facilities you have here because two of these three microphones in each case, meaning two on the judges' desk and two on the witnesses' stand were the ordinary microphonic equipment of the courtroom itself. 
    One microphone, this little one right here which I'm sure you can see from where you are, the little flat one, went to the keeping of the record by the clerk and this is where the testimony went to be recorded. 
    The other microphone that was --

    This is -- this is in every case. 
    Then one of the regular microphones on the judges' desks and one of the two microphones that I've mentioned to you on the witnesses' stand is connected to five little broadcast outlets over here on the inside of the jury box, which was simply to enable a jury to better hear the judge and the witness.

    When the radio people were broadcasting in the pretrial and in the arguments, they used the court microphone.

    Nobody learned anything about the facts of the case and it's been so certified to by Mr. Cofer. 
    Now if I may hurry on. 
    Live telecasting and radio broadcasting were not permitted during the trial itself prior to the arguments of state's counsel. 
    The only telecasting was on film without sound and this was not a continuous camera operation, but pictures were taken at intervals during the debate to be used on regular newscast later in the day. 
    The court did not permit any cameras other than those that were noiseless nor were floodlights and flash bulbs allowed to be used in the courtroom, just ordinary light. 
    The cameras were used on a pooled basis. 
    The court did not permit any telecasting or photographing in the hallways leading into the courtroom or even anywhere on the second floor of the courthouse where the courtroom is situated.

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    It might sir. 
    It might have in my opinion, might have changed things if the witnesses had been able to view what other witnesses had said on the stand, heard them testify, because the witnesses were under the rule which in our state means that they can't talk to anyone about what they testified to nor listen in on the other people's testimony. 
    Now if we'd have that kind of situation, we've might have had something to worry about, but that's the reason and the court so states in here, this is the reason that he wouldn't allow the witnesses' testimony to be a soundtrack or televised live for this very reason.

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    May I say this also, and something here to end as quickly as possible that the appellant, I'm quoting now from the Court of Criminal Appeals in it's decision affirming the conviction of Mr. Estes and it states this. 
    “The contention that appellant was denied full and adequate representation because of his counsel's belief in Canon 35 of the American Bar Association, barring photographs in the courtroom or broadcasting or telecasting court proceedings is not borne out by the record.” 
    And then the court says this, “of the many cases coming to this court, we know of no case where the accused received better or more efficient representation than did the appellant in the present case and at this point, because of the allegations in the opposing briefs that the jurors hearing this case were subject to being influenced by television reports or by other such voice of juror's is already been brought out and under our code of criminal procedure, jury such as this are locked up and kept together and they are absolutely immune from seeing television, hearing radio reports or reading newspaper are particularly seen wise. 
    There was no way for these jurors to get any information that might influence their verdict as a result of the television or broadcasting of these proceeding.”

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    No television was available Mr. Justice except one time during the elections November 4th, I believe it was. 
    Both Mr. Cofer and the court and the prosecutors agreed that a television set could be put in the juror's room and provided that the bailiff was there and would turn it off at the end of -- in case of any ads or any news reports or anything of that type puts it in. 
    That was an agreed matter. 
    We had one case where one of the jurors wanted to have his Bible there. 
    He complains in these affidavits as you will see about the difficulty of getting his Bible because the judge was so intent on seeing that there were no notes or scribbled issues in there that might cause trouble there. 
    He comments about this. 
    He's very carefully supervised. 
    They on occasion were given newspapers over the weekend for example as you speak but before that newspaper was put in there, the judge himself went over every bit of it and cut it out anything pertaining to the trial and he did that himself and one of the jurors remarks that there was hardly anything left but we were glad to get what we could [Laughter]

    Mr. Waggoner Carr 
    May I say this one statement and then I'll leave sir. 
    We respectfully suggest that the answer to the problem that televising trials does not lie in barring all cameras from the courtroom and the final analysis and responsibility for assuring a fair trial remains with the presiding judge. 
    It is his responsibility to keep the press under reasonable control to keep spectators under reasonable control and similarly, he should exercise a responsibility of keeping television under responsible control. 
    The opposing counsel in his brief and in his argument have adopted and has adopted the imaginary reasoning if I might say so of that nursery book character Henny Penny who, when an acorn fell on her head from the tree above went around cockling to all the other hens in the barnyard that this guy was falling in, the end of the world had come. 
    If I might say to you in our opinion all trees do not have acorns and all cameras are not misused.

   Argument of Leon Jaworski
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5506.500" stopTime="5508.165">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Jaworski.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="5508.165" stopTime="5716.457">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I appear in this case at the request of and by appointment of the Attorney General of Texas. 
    In so doing, I am advocating a position in this case which is in considerable conflict with that supported by the brethren of mine with whom I have labored in the vineyard of the American Bar Association. 
    The Court is aware of course of the filing of an amicus curiae brief by the American Bar in this case and also the acknowledgment that petitioner has made in his brief of the assistance that was rendered by members interested in Canon 35 in the preparation of petitioner's brief. 
    I do not for a moment question the earnestness of purpose or the sincerity of those very fine and eminent counsels who are contending in their brief as they are that Canon 35 should be accepted as a constitutional standard, but I do feel that the advocating of this principle has with it much danger and I think that it is unsound. 
    Now because when the writ of certiorari was granted, it was granted on a point that has Canon 35 enmeshed in it being set in the point that Canon 35 should be adopted and accepted as a rule of trial procedure and that unless it is so done, there is denial due process of law I would like to review with the court very briefly the history of Canon 35. 
    I think when we bear this history in mind we see that actually what it is, no more than the statement of ethical standards of conduct, merely a statement of the exemplary conduct should be followed by courts. 
    But I think it's of particular significance that the very -- on the very last occasion that the American Bar Association dealt with Canon 35 at a time when it had its midwinter meeting in 1963. 
    At that time, it very definitely announced its appraisal of Canon 35, an appraisal and a standing that we're willing to adopt. 
    It is our view that at that time, this Canon was correctly elevated to the place where it belonged so far as it being a standard of conduct is concerned but we feel that the position now taken which is far different from that, that it becomes a constitutional standard of conduct is a mistake. 
    Now may I direct the Court's attention to the wording of the resolution of the American Bar Association passed in 1963, the last time that this Association dealt for this Canon.

    It is sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5718.168" stopTime="5721.312">

    Do you happen to know where?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="5721.312" stopTime="6070.610">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    It is in the brief sir. 
    It's at the beginning. 
    Yes sir, it's on page 5 under summary of argument. 
    The Canons of Professional Ethics and the Canons of Judicial Ethics as adopted by the American Bar Association, constitute the standards of policy recommended by the American Bar Association for the consideration and voluntary guidance of the rule making authorities of the states of United States and have a force of law only where voluntarily adopted and incorporated in state laws or as a rule of Court. 
    We recommend that the rule-making authority of each state exercise the exclusive responsibility of adopting Canons of ethics in the interest of statewide uniformity and avoidance of confusion and pressures that have resulted in some jurisdictions where magistrates or judges have individually adopted rules concerning the conduct of their courts. 
    Now this was a recommendation made by the committee that have been studying this matter and this recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates and following the adoption of this resolution, the committee that had been dealing with Canon 35 was discharged and this is the last time that the American Bar Association officially dealt with this Canon. 
    I would like to briefly comment on the history of Canon 35 even before this last action occurred because I think it's very significant in showing what its true purpose was. 
    The very first of the Canon's of Judicial Ethics were adopted in 1924. 
    At that time, there was no Canon 35, there were 34 Canons at that time. 
    In 1937, Canon 35 was adopted for the first time it read differently at that time than it does now. 
    It placed its emphasis upon matters that are far different from what is argued now. 
    It placed its emphasis upon the dignity and the decorum in the courtroom. 
    It placed emphasis upon the fact that photography and broadcasting and that's all it referred to at that time were degrading to the court, and that it placed its emphasis upon the statement that photography and broadcasting should not be permitted because of the misconceptions that might be left for the public. 
    Now the Canon was then amended in 1952, and at that time, again there were these things stressed by the Canon. 
    First, dignity and decorum, again degrading of the court, creating misconceptions in the minds of the public, but for the first time that was included televising and it was then said that these elements, these factors, the televising, photography and broadcasting are calculated to detract the witness in giving his testimony. 
    The last amendment to Canon 35 was made at this time that I have mentioned to the Court a few minutes ago, in 1963. 
    It was made after this case was tried in the Trial Court. 
    And at that time, we find that the part of Canon 35, that related to the degrading of the court had been dropped and so after these many years of experience, after this many years of insisting that photographing and broadcasting were degrading to the court, the American Bar Association changed its mind and dropped that from the Canon, but in order to under guard it and because there was included a change an amendment, a further amendment which said that instead of calculated to distract the witness that it is calculated to distract that it is -- that it does distract witnesses, distract witnesses and participants but that was the last change that was made. 
    Now again, if we go back to the preamble about Canons of Ethics as to what the entire purpose was, we see that the preamble states too in matter entirely consistent with what was said by the American Bar Association as late as 1963. 
    We find that it says that the Association adopts the following Canons, the spirit of which it suggests as a proper guide and reminder for judges and is indicating what the people have a right to expect from them. 
    Now there are a number of Canons. 
    Canon 35 is before the Court but why should Canon 35 be singled out as one that sets forth constitutional standards and none of the other Canons. 
    We have situations where there can be an abuse of Canon 35 that obviously affect in our thinking the constitutional rights of a defendant, but that can be true with respect to spectators. 
    It can be true with respect to the press, it can be true with respect to television. 
    Other Canons are in exactly the same situation and if a Canon 5 for instance which deals with impatience and intemperateness on the part of the court. 
    Now that could seriously affect the fairness of the accused trial, but doesn't necessarily do so simply because a judge has made some intemperate remarks or has shown some impatience. 
    Does it per se mean that because that Canon has been violated that there has been a denial of due process.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6070.610" stopTime="6081.919">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course Canon 35 isn't before us here at all. 
    What is before us is that whether what happened to this trial has violated this petitioner's right to due process of law.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="6081.919" stopTime="6083.319">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    We fully agree with.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6083.319" stopTime="6084.595">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I think that's the point you're making.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="6084.595" stopTime="6146.008">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    That's the point I'm making exactly. 
    The question of whether there has been any unfairness here is something that has to be looked at on a basis of its own factual situation and my comments to the Court are being made simply in response to what the petitioner has been arguing when he says, the mere fact that there has been a television camera in the courtroom and that's what it amounts to that there has been prejudice. 
    And in making that sort of a contention what is actually happening here is that the principles that this Court has announced on a number of occasions are being swept aside because so far as I know, I haven't found a single case where this Court has ever said that it is going to be presumed that there was a denial of due process of law, that there is going to be a presumption that the defendant has been denied a fair trial. 
    I know that this Court has said just the contrary in a number of cases.

    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    That's correct sir but you had in a record, they're a state of facts from which it appears that there had been an unfairness. 
    Point that I'm making is that if you have simply a position where it is said that there has been here some prejudice simply because of television camera was introduced in the courtroom then you're going to have to say precisely the same thing simply because a television camera was in there for a short period of time taking perhaps no more than the oaths that were administered to the jurors where will a line be drawn.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I take it your argument then would be exactly the same as the television here has not been limited to just pictures during the trial. 
    The reason the court gave for excluding time had nothing to do with the fair trial except the informing other witnesses and I take it you would back up that -- that reason and if that is term, you would still be making the same argument?

    Mr. Leon Jaworski

    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    Because one was under the control of the court, and one was under the supervision of the court and the other one is not. 
    Precisely the same argument that I'm making here I think would apply if you have a tremendously large courtroom, there's no regulation as to what the size of the courtroom maybe so long as the court can supervise and can properly control the conduct of what goes on.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    It seems quite recently. 
    I would like to ask this. 
    Why television is a public media of communication you've argued in your brief, why isn't every purpose of publicity and public access to what goes on in the courtroom serve or the television medium as well as any other by allowing the television reporters to cover a court trial, by being there, and then reporting on it as newspaper do?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="6366.700" stopTime="6431.217">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    That's one way of doing it, but it doesn't necessarily follow that because it's done by the broadcasting of pictures from the courtroom that there has been an unfair trial. 
    Again, the trial itself is a public event and the Court has said so. 
    The Court has said that what transpires in the courtroom is public property. 
    Now the only question is, one of degree and the question then comes of whether or not there has something happened in that courtroom and has denied the defendant a fair trial. 
    Now that could occasion just as well and come about just as well by virtue of the spectators that are in the courtroom. 
    It can – could come about just as well by virtue of the number of newspaper men that are in a courtroom. 
    It could also come about by virtue of broadcasting and televising, but the mere fact that there is broad what transpires in the courtroom to a thousand people let's say instead of 50 people or 50,000 instead of a thousand, why should that as long as it is fairly portrayed mean that the defendant has been denied a fair trial.

    What are some differences between the examples you've cite and the [Inaudible] courtroom press. 
    You said that [Inaudible] might do that because they were in the courtroom, but here we have a situation of this kind and set out by the court itself that makes those things not only possible, but probable. 
    Now doesn't that change the character that the Court could be responsible if someway [Inaudible] to this courtroom? 
    The witness did thought that if the court knowingly set up the situation that is not known to be possible but was likely -- it wouldn't make a difference.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="6546.592" stopTime="6608.714">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I follow everything Mr. Chief Justice that you say except the conclusion that is implied in your question and if there is any unfairness of the trial per se by virtue of that. 
    It could result to the unfairness, but it perhaps might not. 
    The point I'm making is that it is true and may I illustrate it. 
    For instance, suppose we have 20 members of the press who are there by permission of the court and you also have at present a number of spectators, in fact the courtroom for the spectators. 
    You have one television camera that's obscured that takes only a few of the proceedings for instance the swearing in of witness or such as that. 
    Now, let's remove the 20 members of the press and let's remove the spectators, but you still have that television camera the mere fact that the television camera is there, are we going to conclude from that that there has been an unfairness in the trial? 
    Now all of these things were permitted by the court. 
    You have less disorder Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6608.714" stopTime="6641.364">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The other things are -- are inherent in the trial, in the courtroom because our system demands if the public to the extent or the defendant didn't have his friends in the general public to see the trial, to see that he is not being deprived of any of his rights but these others are super imposed upon it and are not going to protect the defendant, but for the commercialization of some newspaper. 
    Is that a difference there?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="6641.364" stopTime="6702.357">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I can't see the difference Mr. Chief Justice as far as the question of due process, denial of due process is concerned. 
    I can certainly see the difference from the standpoint of what might be called a dignified proceeding. 
    I can see there is difference from what might be said to be the course because I can well see where a lot of confusion could result from it. 
    I cannot see the difference when it gets down to applying the test that this Court has applied in several cases on the question of what constitutes a denial of due process alone. 
    If we were to reach a conclusion, otherwise, we would have to say that there is no burden at all on the defendant any longer to show any kind of an invasion of, to hear the fairness of his trial but all he have to do is come in and say, well there has been a picture taken here. 
    There's been some televising and that ends it. 
    I'm entitled to a new trial. 
    Now that would be a very extreme rule. 
    It would be a rule far different from any that this Court has ever announced before and I think it's contrary to rules that the Court has announced.

    It has always said that there should be something for the voluntary guidance of the states themselves and it certainly should not be considered as affecting the question of due process or the question of fairness of trial and if it had ever been found that that was so, we can be certain it would have been placed in Canon 35 but there is not the slightest reference to that effect.

   Argument of Hume D. Cofer

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Cofer.
speaker="hume_d_cofer" startTime="6918.158" stopTime="7060.987">
    Mr. Hume D. Cofer 
    May it please the Court. 
    The defendant's case does not depend upon the proposition that the constitution prevents TV. 
    The defendant's case depends upon proposition that the defendant has the right to object to a process which has no judicial function and which will probably prejudice it and to that where that process has no judicial function, he, the defendant ought to be entitled to have some say about whether or not it is utilized. 
    Now there are two or three things that I must cover about the facts that I do want to cover. 
    First, there was a question about when the defendant arrived in September, the defendant arrived early in the morning in the courtroom of September the 24th only 15 or 20 or 30 minutes after the proceedings began prior to the arrival of the defendant -- the defendant's counsel only stated their position. 
    All of the testimony on the September the 24th and 25th was taken in the presence of the defendant. 
    This is not the way the courtroom appeared in September. 
    The way the courtroom appeared in September is shown by the photographs, 8/10 photographs, the shiny ones, which show the cameras in the microphones and that one microphone that's not shown and it's this one that was protruding across the edge of the jury box at this point, the directional microphone which was capable of picking up counsel and the defendant's conversations at this table, the record shows. 
    The record shows that there was sound being taped in October. 
    Both radio reporters testified on pages 99 and pages 101 of the record that at the October hearing, they were tape recording that portion of the October proceedings. 
    The broadcast of that sound had been prohibited and the reporters testified that it was not being recorded for the purpose of rebroadcast but it was available for rebroadcast and that sound was being recorded in October by the radio facilities as shown on pages 99 and 101 of the record.

    On pages 99 and 101, the two young radio reporters were called to the witness stand in October and testified that right at that time and on the October 5th, they were recording the sound. 
    They said that they were not doing it for rebroadcast but they were recording sound and they had the facility there to do it and one testified on page 101 that, that would be available for rebroadcast. 
    The court had directed in order that it may not be rebroadcast and there's nothing in the record to indicate that it was.

    What I don't understand Mr. Cofer, I thought the Attorney General said that that mic he pointed out on the witness box which would have recorded that the machine from the back in the courtroom had been made dead, had been cut off so that it wasn't possible for any recording.

    There were instead of the three cameras shown in the model, there are four cameras shown in the model. 
    The testimony shows that there were five cameras shown in the model on page 65. 
    That was on the opening days of the October hearing. 
    The model does not show and they have not been mentioned, the press photographers who were not required to stay in the booth, they were permitted the full access to the room and so long as they stayed behind the jury box.
