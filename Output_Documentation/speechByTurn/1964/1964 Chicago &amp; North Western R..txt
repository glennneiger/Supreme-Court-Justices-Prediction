    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This matter arises from a connection of two railroads in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Milwaukee Road, one of the appellees and the Lake Superior and Ishpeming one of the other appellees. 
    These are both Class 1 railroads subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the significant fact of the lesser luminary, the Lake Superior and Ishpeming which we shall as the L.S.&amp; I. is that it is controlled significantly by the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company as the record shows. 
    Now, this connection is the first time in history as the record likewise shows that these two railroads have ever been physically connected. 
    Now, there appears in the record a large print which was prepared by the appellant, Milwaukee, showing this situation where the mainline and it is important I suggest in view of certain decisions of this Court that this is the mainline of the Ishpeming, L.S. &amp; I., coming down here and ultimately terminating at iron mine at a place called Republic, Michigan. 
    Likewise, here comes the mainline of the Milwaukee up and ultimately terminating at a point called Champion, Michigan. 
    The connection is constructed here between these two points shown as A to B, rather small, 262 feet in all to accomplish the connection. 
    But the Court should see that it is physically impossible for trains ever to operate this connection and to deliver cars upon these interchanged tracks. 
    The red shows Milwaukee ownership, the blue shows the L.S.&amp; I. ownership. 
    It is physically impossible in the first instance for the Milwaukee ever to achieve the delivery which we call interchange, the placement of a car routed with traffic in a position where another railroad may pick it up. 
    Impossible physically to operate under these interchanged tracks by the Milwaukee without operating between C and D, the main line of the Ishpeming. 
    The Court should see also, and it is important because the court below did not see this.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Is your client an intervenor?
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="202.277" stopTime="449.495">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    Northwestern intervened in the complaint brought by the railroad which is not here, the Sew Line, in the proceeding before the Commission. 
    The Commission proceeding culminated in a three-judge review in a federal court in Wisconsin and is hereby direct appeal. 
    Now, not only is it necessary for Milwaukee to operate on the L.S.&amp; I. mainline in order to arrive on these interchanged tracks, but having arrived on its track one, where it delivers its locomotive on the head end of these cars must come up on to the L.S.&amp; I. in order to return back to the Milwaukee Road either through track two if there are no L.S.&amp; I. cars waiting to be taken on to the Milwaukee or over the L.S.&amp; I. mainline for a very significant, what we have here, roughly 3000 feet. 
    Now, originally this was set up as a lease of the mainline of the L.S.&amp; I. to the Milwaukee. 
    Once the Commission received the complaint of the other intervenor, Sew Line, the lease was changed into a form of agreement which is set out. 
    The lease originally appears in the record beginning at page 49, describes the lease of L.S.&amp; I.'s main track on that page and on page 51. 
    At the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the agreement was transformed into a license. 
    We contend this makes no difference, tracked rights being involved may be a personal right. 
    They involve no necessary estate in the land. 
    This Court has so held in Thompson against the Texas-Mexican Railroad Company in the 328 Volume of the United States reports. 
    Well, the form then should make no difference but the court below was confused into thinking that, and it left out one element of the preceding we feel that and the court below held at page 390 of the record that there was no operation by either of these appellees across the line of the other's railroad. 
    The fact here is that it is physically impossible to accomplish this interchange of traffic without that type of operation. 
    Now, once there was a connection through routes were established by rate action taken by the Milwaukee and the L.S.&amp; I. 
    A connection of course is a sine qua non of through routes. 
    Without the connection, there can be no through routes. 
    Now, prior to this time, there existed between the point designated Sunrise Landing on Lake Superior and Ishpeming, this is contracted from an exhibit in the record. 
    It's very dramatically oversimplified. 
    There existed between a major shipping point, Sunrise Landing owned by Cleveland-Cliffs shipping, Cleveland-Cliffs forest products, a two-line through route between Northwestern and L.S.&amp; I. where L.S.&amp; I. could bring the traffic either to Ishpeming or a lower point designated, Little Lake, transport to Northwestern and bring it to Iron Mountain, Michigan where there was located a substantial consuming industry and to which the predominant portion of this traffic moved as the Commission found. 
    The fact of the two-line interchange was important because the record shows and the Commission found that unless the receiver at Iron Mountain could have two-line rates in his inbound forest products, sawlogs, chemical woods, the grades of the classification in terms of absolutely low rated commodities. 
    He would instead --

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    As far as classification, we do not have a term any longer that says first class, fifth class. 
    In fact now, these are commodity rates --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Commodity.
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="468.409" stopTime="472.782">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    -- and they take 20%, we'll say, or 14% of the first class rating.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="472.782" stopTime="474.155">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    First class rate.
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="474.155" stopTime="657.204">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Quite low rated as the Commission did find sir. 
    Now, the Milwaukee could participate in such a movement, but it could not make a two-line move with L.S.&amp; I. 
    There was no physical connection at this point which was to become republic junction. 
    Then, it puts do it with the Sew Line as a three-line route more expensive and would not be competitive. 
    The record is quite clear on this. 
    After October 21, when the connection was constructed, the route existed and the records show more than half of the traffic began flowing this way. 
    This the Commission found contrary to the public interest because the industry in this area in its opinion was not adequate to sustain the existing operations after diluting this traffic, this light density low rated traffic, among so many more carriers. 
    Now, the issue as it arose three-judge court was jurisdiction, this is a word of many facets and it has always caused complications and the essential facts or the essential theories were these. 
    The Milwaukee and the L.S.&amp; I. had always relied upon an old Missouri Pacific case. 
    And we, in our turn, had relied upon the Alabama and Vicksburg decision of this Court in the 271 United States. 
    Now, the -- do not mistake our thinking. 
    We suggest that in Alabama and Vicksburg there was more than the single element of a connection between the main lines of two major railroads. 
    We feel, however, that isn't an alternative disposition in that case, certainly no less.This Court held that the Commission must have jurisdiction over connections between mainlines of Class 1 railroad, because of the competitive consequences which emanate from it, because of the possibility of thereby opening up new through routes. 
    Now, the Commission did find that by virtue of this connection the competitive picture changed quite drastically in the territory. 
    Now, the court below made three serious mistakes we feel. 
    First, it went outside the record in order to sustain several of the findings which are contained in its report. 
    I would point to the Court at page 391 of the record. 
    The court below says that this is an unpopulated wilderness. 
    Now, there was ample opportunity in a hearing before a commission examiner in a returned questionnaire in the various applications filed by these applicants below to assert this.It does not appear in this record anywhere.

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, second, this Court sitting as a reviewing court put itself in the position of a court deciding in the first instance whether being approached by a railroad with the assertion that its competitor was building an unauthorized connection. 
    It, the one-judge court should compel that competing railroad to go to the Interstate Commerce Commission and establish that the interconnection was compatible with the public interest. 
    Now, there have been established a long line of cases and several tests pretty well settling what are the elements of inquiry of a one-judge court in such a matter. 
    We respectfully submit that this is far from the function of a reviewing court after the commission has passed upon the juris -- pardon me, upon the jurisdictional question, and after it has passed on it here as it did so carefully in its report, and after as it observes and its examiner observes this disposition is consistent with the Commission's uniformed practice in these matters. 
    And we would like to point out that the more recent decisions of this Court which we explain at considerable length in the briefs here are positively repugnant in our opinion with that construction. 
    Now, this Court dealt with two decisions here, Powell against the United States and the United States versus Idaho. 
    Both three-judge courts, both affirmed here on holdings that where the jurisdictional question arose before the Commission ought to differ entirely because this was mixed question of law and fact susceptible of resolution only in a federal court not before the Commission. 
    We submit to the Court that the Commission has evolved the practice which lays Mr. Justice Brandeis foundation there at rest. 
    And that the Commission is now able as it was here and in many other cases which we have decided to bring recalcitrant carriers before it, and to apply a transportation standard to these statutory specifics in determining whether the public interest permits an interconnection. 
    Now, this Powell and Idaho series of cases we submit hs been seriously eroded by the District Courts applying these standards ultimately by the Second Circuit which we have cited to the Court already. 
    We have the State of Illinois case. 
    We have the State of Georgia case. 
    We have the Yonkers decisions which the federal courts now have come to recognize as giving the Commission first instance power and presumptive weight on review in determining this essential element of jurisdiction. 
    For as this Court found in Yonkers, as this Court rules squarely in Yonkers, without the jurisdictional decision by the Interstate Commission a federal court ought had nothing to do with review of its order. 
    These are basic questions of federalism. 
    We have the states and the Interstate Commission constantly in a turmoil as to whose power shall dispose of the public interest question. 
    And this Court, we feel, made this quite clear in the Yonkers case that without that decision by the Commission, there could be nothing further in an abandonment or an extension proceeding. 
    The Commission made those findings. 
    They are eminently well reasonably submitted, and they ought to have been treated with not finality by with the presumptive weight which ordinarily attaches to the routine disposition by the administrative agency of these essential elements. 
    Now, the Court had this question before it in the State of Georgia case where the jurisdictional statement argued at page 26 in number 774 of the October term of 1957, and I quote, "The jurisdiction of the Commission must be decided by the Court unhampered by findings of the Commission, the scope of judicial inquiry into this matter being unrestricted." 
    Now, we don't suggest that some reaffirmance here disposed of that as a complete disposition by this Court. 
    We do suggest, however, that the regular erosion which preceded the State of Georgia case was receiving at least acquiescence from this Court by the summary affirmance which resulted in that matter. 
    Now, the court below took one unique aberrational decision, it took the Missouri-Pacific matter and relying upon that said, "This is too small a matter for the Interstate Commerce Commission to concern itself with." 
    If the Court were to look at the Missouri-Pacific decision it would find, this is in 60 F.2d commencing at page 126. 
    It would find that the carriers there seeking to interchange at that time had and historically had had an interchange which permitted them to connect and to establish and there were established a line of through routes over them. 
    A second carrier came in not party to this proceeding and said, "We want you to" -- it acquired the little bridge line over which these two carriers had interchanged in the past. 
    It said, "Now you'll do it with us a different way." 
    And they said, "Well we'll simply build across and forget with any need for your service." 
    And in fact that was done and the court there said. 
    There's no significant competitive or other change. 
    We find no need for it to go to the Interstate Commission. 
    That is a far cry we submit from the type of decision here. 
    But now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1173.333" stopTime="1189.024">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This -- the court here recognized that, and I read their opinion on page 391 that in the Missouri-Pacific case trade had already -- have always been interchanged between the two lines.

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Very clearly. 
    It's a logical deficiency in the analogy, we submit.

    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Quite significant sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1211.272" stopTime="1215.777">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- and decisive distinction between this case and the Missouri-Pacific case?
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="1215.777" stopTime="1425.705">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Yes sir. 
    Now, the final problem that occurs here and we submit ought to concern this Court is this, that this court below equated an invasion of territory under the Texas and Pacific case with an extension of line as designated by the statute. 
    It said that without an invasion, there could be no extension and therefore no 118 disposing of physical invasion because we would not contend that his 262 feet is a physical invasion. 
    It said that there can be other type of extension under Section 118, not so says the Interstate Commission, because in a case which we have cited, the case which ultimately came to this Court and was affirmed under the State of Georgia decision. 
    The Commission said, "We have three tests of extension." 
    This appears at page 20 of our original brief. 
    It said, "This include among other things matters pertaining to the purpose of the track" and then "Whether new routes in interstate commerce would be established through the use of such track" and then as a third element "whether the construction and operation would constitute an invasion." 
    So to the Interstate Commission, there are three tests. 
    It has applied these tests for quite a long while. 
    And the court says, "There can be but one, as we announce the statute to you the Commission, you have found an incorrect test of extension therefore you may not be sustained." 
    This, we submit, unduly restricts the Commission and its routine administration of the statute with which it is charged. 
    Finally, the Milwaukee concedes and the Ishpeming at page 38 of their brief that there would be 118 jurisdiction over this extension if there were trackage rights and it argues with simply an ipse dixit for authority that because they reach no new terminal there are none. 
    We submit that the Alabama and Vicksburg decision, the Thompson versus Texas-Mexican decision and the many decisions cited by the Interstate Commerce Commission added to by Milwaukee's own preceding before the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 118 to abandon and interchange nder almost identical circumstances indicate very clearly that there does exist this element of Section 118 jurisdiction. 
    The District Court did not deal with this issue. 
    Now, we would therefore contend that the decision of the Commission clearly had a complete support in its evidential record. 
    It was amply rationalized and that it had a very ample foundation in repeated decisions not only of this Court, but its own uniform practice. 
    And upon that basis, there was no need nor to the decision of this Court permit, re-decision of the issue anew by the reviewing court. 
    If there is time remaining, I should like to use it for rebuttal.

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    -- is only 262 feet long. 
    To the best of my knowledge this is the shortest track over which the Interstate Commerce Commission has ever asserted Section 118 jurisdiction. 
    The track comes to this Court in a case raising an issue solely of the commission's jurisdiction under Section 118. 
    As such, the question is not similar to what it might be if the appeal to the lower court had been from a finding of the Commission made on a matter clearly within the scope of the Commission's authority to act. 
    That was not the case here. 
    We contested the initial basic jurisdiction of the commission to entertain and decide this case under Section 118.

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    It might be Your Honor and let me elaborate that. 
    In my opinion, one justification where the Commission's 118 jurisdiction would be a very expensive construction of trackage. 
    Expensive to the extent that it would imperil the financial status of the carrier making the construction. 
    If as in the Texas case, that should be the case, then I believe the Commission rightly could take jurisdiction under Section 118. 
    However, in this case the track cost only $28,000 and considering the size and the financial position of both railroads involved that expenditure would be minimal.

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    In my opinion Your Honor, no. 
    The track is used only as a switching track. 
    No trains move over the connection. 
    No trains move from one railroad to another via the connection. 
    The operation is simply one of switching. 
    The same sort of switching which occurs in any railroad yard, and for this reason Mr. Chief Justice, it would be my opinion that no matter how long the track was so long as the operation were a purely a switching operation, there would be no difference. 
    Section 122 clearly and specifically exempts switching tracks from the requirements of Section 118 and therefore of course from the Commission's Section 118 jurisdiction.

    These are carriers which are already loaded on one railroad at another point. 
    They are hold by that railroad to the side of this connection and then if you will interchange with the other railroad over this connection, so the cars are already loaded. 
    However, it is a switching movement, just as much as any switching movement in a railroad yard is. 
    Now, the Commission says that it is more than a pure switching movement because it is a part of an actual through movement. 
    Well, so it is but so is also a switching movement in a yard by which railroad cars are classified for further movement. 
    It is also a switching movement when a railroad goes at -- makes the locomotive to go into an industry to pick up cars the industry has loaded. 
    That also is a switching movement but it is also equally as necessary to the through movement of that rail traffic. 
    If the railroad can't pick up the cars of the place where they were loaded, they can't make any line haul or through movement with those cars. 
    But these are --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Long, that -- that language that you just spoke of if there were any frivolous switching movement, and that concludes the paragraph it says, through the use of connecting -- connecting tracks, best as established a through route into the facts and which is stated in (Inaudible) or to this system the situation or (Inaudible).
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="2507.901" stopTime="2581.664">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    There are two points on the question you just raised. 
    The first is this, there are to my knowledge only two ways for railroads to be so managed to become one system, one is by merger. 
    And of course the Interstate Commerce Commission has full control over a merger and their approval must be obtained prior to the merger. 
    Secondly, and perhaps more important in this case, two railroads can be used as one system when a railroad connects with another and moves its full trains in a line haul movement as opposed to a switching movement over the connection to a new destination on the line of the other railroad. 
    And even to this, Interstate Commerce Commission approval under Section 118 must be obtained not however because the trains move over the connecting track but because the trains move over the track of the other railroad pursuant to the trackage rights and to a new destination. 
    The same as if the railroad had built its own tracks to the new destination.

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    There is one other interesting answer to your question, however, which might have some bearing upon this. 
    And that is the question of through routes. 
    The Commission based its determination primarily, I think on the fact that new through routes were made possible by the connection. 
    But through routes are completely irrelevant to any question concerning a trackage. 
    This connection could exist without the through routes. 
    As a matter of fact any extension could exist without through routes and still be an extension. 
    The Milwaukee Road could build a new line of track from Chicago to Washington. 
    It would cost a tremendous amount of money and if we never shipped a single cargo or traffic over that track, we would still have an extension if for no other reason on the cost. 
    Similarly, the through route might also exist in the absence of the connection. 
    It would be quite unfeasible but still possible for the railroads to put a crane between the two tracks and physically lift up the cars from one railroad put them on the tracks of the other railroad. 
    We have a through route then. 
    The railroads could hold themselves out to perform the continuous transportation service by that means and --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But how could it go the other way so far as this case is here now? 
    The way that they move traffic (Voice Overlap).

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    The fact the traffic can move over republic junction Your Honor. 
    It means that the traffic will not move via the Sew Line or via the Northwestern to their connections with the Milwaukee. 
    And in effect, what the connection does is eliminate the Sew Line on the one hand and also the Northwestern from participation in the track.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Long what -- what carriers is the Commission talking about in the previous sentence? 
    All traffic destined to points on either the defendant lines but for this connection, I interpolate, would have moved over routes in which other carriers would have participated.

    (Inaudible)

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    I suppose there might be a scintilla of evidence. 
    But Mr. Justice Black, this question is proper for the Commission's consideration on the issue of public convenience and necessity. 
    And this, the lower court, did not reach in its decision. 
    The lower court decided only the jurisdictional issue. 
    May I suggest that republic junction is an improvement of the facilities provided by these railroads to the shipping public and as such the connection fulfills the railroads' duties to serve the public? 
    In 14 Stat. 66, the railroads are authorized to make connections with other railroads with the through movement of traffic and Section 14 of the Interstate Commerce Act likewise imposes a duty upon railroads to create through routes and to make new facilities for the efficient operation of the through routes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3077.032" stopTime="3078.823">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The Commission approved these through routes?
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3078.823" stopTime="3090.922">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    No, sir. 
    The Commission need not approve the creation of any through route, nor can -- nor can the Commission prohibit the voluntary creation of a through route.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3090.922" stopTime="3093.336">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that's the effect on this one?
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3093.336" stopTime="3101.195">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    That is the effect, but by the Commission's decision, it attempts to prohibit the new through route which is made possible by the connection.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3101.195" stopTime="3114.919">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you say that that was (Inaudible).
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3114.919" stopTime="3148.003">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    Yes, sir. 
    And I believe it is completely unlawful thing for the Commission to do because I don't believe Congress has ever given them authority to prohibit the creation of a voluntary through route. 
    If they had, in my opinion, Congress would have given the Commission that power within the limits of Section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act which deals with through routes, but not under Section 118 which deals with physical trackage in the construction of extensions of railroad line.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3148.003" stopTime="3167.572">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Was that another way of saying Mr. Long that if they rested this on the effect of the connection on the traffic of competing roads. 
    If they did, that as a matter of law that's an improper consideration and determination under 118 whether that something is an extension?
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3167.572" stopTime="3170.379">

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    Yes, now perhaps what Your Honor has reference to is some case arising under Section 15 (3) or Section 15 (4) by which one railroad may go to the commission seeking the Commission's order compelling another railroad to join with in a through route. 
    But --

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    -- they can compel it sir but not forbid it and they certainly cannot forbid the voluntary creation of the through route. 
    It seems to me that one of the implicit factors about rail transportation in the United States is the ability of a shipper to ship any traffic from any point in the United States to any other point by rail. 
    This is I think it once a strength of our railroad system and it is this ability which republic junction makes possible in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan so far as the traffic moving there over is concerned.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Long before you sit down, if -- in you view, if we should disagree with the District Court on the grounds which the District Court decided this case, would it be appropriate then for us to remand this case to the District Court for that court to pass upon the second issue, the issue of public convenience and necessity?

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    It would be if it had the same function and were only a switching movement and cost no more money --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3330.930" stopTime="3335.626">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if they do nothing else -- do nothing with it other than what they do with this.

    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3336.106" stopTime="3344.166">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They do nothing but that, the 20 miles of track and you get the same result under even with 100 miles. 
    If all they did was to had interconnecting traffic over this construction.
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3344.166" stopTime="3358.594">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    However, it is difficult to conceive of such a situation which would not involve the extension of the railroad to a new terminus and therefore ipso facto the fact would be an extension.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3358.594" stopTime="3366.300">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No difference than they just, they could've been 200 feet apart, they're 20 miles apart running parallel they just put a connection between them.
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3366.300" stopTime="3388.660">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    But republic junction is completely constructed within the confines of the rights of way of the Milwaukee and the Ishpeming. 
    If we likewise construct a track 100 hundred miles long without going outside the rights of way of the railroad, then I would say it would be exactly the same. 
    But it is difficult to conceive of that of course.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3388.660" stopTime="3397.293">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you -- all you -- once you break the boundaries of the rights of way, you've got something beside the switching tracks?
speaker="frank_m_long" startTime="3397.293" stopTime="3443.559">
    Mr. Frank M. Long 
    Perhaps, but not necessarily. 
    It would be -- the longer the track is, the more likely it is that we would have something else besides just a switching track. 
    There are certain other statutes such as the airbrake statute which requires trains to move over, and by train I mean a locomotive in a caboose with the air hose is connected so that the train has brakes. 
    It requires certain movements to be made with cranes as opposed to switching movements. 
    And I would think that if the track that you described, a hundred miles long, were possible that these other statutes would require trains to move over that and that itself would make quite a difference, I believe. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John C. Danielson

    Mr. Danielson.
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="3445.353" stopTime="3516.234">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    I'd like to answer several specific questions, if I may. 
    The question most recently raised by Mr. Justice Black is one which troubles me. 
    The question is concerning the power of the Commission to permit the establishment of the new through route. 
    Now, I think that you should be quite clear Mr. Justice Black that the railroad having a connection is empowered to establish unilaterally new through routes over any existing connection, no question. 
    The Commission indeed may compel a railroad to establish new through routes which do not exist over an existing connection but which the railroad itself does not see fit to establish. 
    But what we have here is the but for, but for this 200 feet of track there would exist no possibility for the railroad voluntarily or compulsorily to establish through routes. 
    This "but for" is what the Commission has power to control because this "but for" has immense competitive and transportation significance we submit.

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Alright, let me make this point. 
    The decisions of this Court say, and we've set out a number of them at pages 14 through 15 of our original brief here. 
    These decisions, and I'm citing from the Oregon-Washington case back in the 288 U.S., say that an extension though something other than a team switching industrial or sidetrack need not, in order to be distinguished there from, and I interpolate in order therefore to be outside of the Section 122 exemption. 
    They are building into a new and previously un-served locality. 
    You don't need a new destination this Court has held, and in answer to Mr. Justice White --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3581.380" stopTime="3593.900">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Can you justify the claim under 118 of designating something as an extension even more than nothing but conviction --

    You raise this question --

    -- through routes.
speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="3598.532" stopTime="3644.851">
    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    -- you raised this question earlier Mr. Justice Black. 
    The certificate under what ground does the Commission take jurisdiction here, under what book of Section 118. 
    The application set out at page 24 of the record says, that these applicants want a certificate to operate over an interchanged connection. 
    This Court holds in the Alabama and Vicksburg case and in the Texas-Mexican case that this type of a connection is within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 118, the existence of the connection; the potential for establishing through routes. 
    These factors bring within the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 118 such a connection. 
    Now --

    Mr. John C. Danielson 
    Specifically and the Tex-Mex case likewise specifically settles that point. 
    There is a clear holding where it was necessary to reach Section 118 under the trackage rights issue in order to take from the bankruptcy court and refer to the Interstate Commerce Commission the issue of trackage rights and their establishment in that case abandonment.

    We set forward the language of this Court in the Texas and New Orleans case and let me emphasize this briefly. 
    The purpose of Sections -- of paragraphs 18 to 22 is to prevent interstate carriers from weakening themselves by constructing or operating superfluous lines and to protect them from being weakened by another carriers operating in interstate commerce a competing line not required in the public interest.
