    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And this has a single issue and it can well be argued in 30 minutes.
speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="55.969" stopTime="281.066">
    Mr. Bernard G. Segal 
    Fine, but I will remember to do so. 
    Now, I will consider that. 
    First, I should like to correct and this is one of my problems, the misapprehension created in the other argument yesterday, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, that there is a simple expedient here that the government can just go to the tax court. 
    Your Honors, will remember that, that was the answer you got form Mr. Begley when you asked the question, that simply isn't so. 
    In the first place, the government can never go to the tax court. 
    The tax court is not available to the government. 
    In the second place, what would happen in the related situation, demonstrates the safeguard that Congress did place on fraud cases because what would happen is the taxpayer would got a 90-day letter. 
    He would then come to the tax court and ask the tax court to stay the assessment. 
    Then the government would have to raise the defense of fraud and the statute expressly says that, then the government has the burden of proving fraud and the rules say it must then set forth all the facts that constitute the fraud. 
    Then it must improve suspicion of fraud, it must then prove fraud. 
    So that as Your Honors can see that government even if allowed to go the tax court under those circumstances never would because it would have to show all the facts and would have a far greater burden. 
    So that simply was on a say, with full deference an erroneous answer to the justices' question. 
    Second I should like to point out, yesterday I said that it was not available to the government in this case, the argument on the affidavit's conclusory statement about over purchases. 
    Since that is not the issue presented for certiorari and it wasn't the issue argued in the District Court. 
    But there's a much more fundamental reason, I should like to refer Your Honors to that argument by the Court, because it really shows what the Courts -- what the Government's concept is of a fair hearing in this case. 
    Because what it means is that the Court believes -- the government believes that all it has to do is file an affidavit, refuse to permit the witness to appear, and on that conclusory statement get relief. 
    Now, Your Honors will remember that in Reisman, this Court held and the government contended the very opposite of that. 
    It said, don't permit the government to be enjoined by the taxpayer because he has the right to a full adversary hearing. 
    Now is that a hearing? 
    You file an affidavit with a conclusory statement, you refuse to produce the witness, isn't cross-examination the first fundamental of a fair hearing? 
    So I say to Your Honors that while the substance isn't available, the argument really points out, the government's view point here that what the Court is a rubber stamp. 
    That when the government comes to the Court for enforcement all the Court can do is say, "Here's an affidavit, you don't have to produce the witness, he doesn't have to be cross-examined." 
    And now Mr. Justice Black to relieve your mind as to the length of the hearings, may I say that I have reviewed all of the cases. 
    In only one case did the hearing exceed a day, because all that's involved is the suspicion of fraud and therefore all that has to be done is to put the agent on and in these cases what has happened is the agent says "Here are my grounds for suspecting fraud." 
    There is usually nothing the taxpayer can do except cross-examine him as to the honesty of whether he is giving answers that are true. 
    On one or two occasions, there was countervailing testimony, in only one case was a day-and-a-half consumed, usually a half day is consumed in all this cases.

    Mr. Bernard G. Segal 
    The issue is whether the government has a reasonable basis for suspecting fraud, whether it can meet this burden relatively slight which is cast upon it. 
    In the relatively few cases out of the 60 million taxpayers, where it wants to allege fraud, whether before it can place on the taxpayer the onus of a fraud examination, it comes into Court and says "Your Honor, we'd like our summons enforced and we'd like it enforced because we have a suspicion of fraud and the reason we suspect fraud is this” and all the cases have used that test for alternatively probable cause except Judge Browning who has used this rational judgment.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="381.105" stopTime="617.654">
    Mr. Bernard G. Segal 
    The real question Mr. Justice Goldberg is whether the government has any basis to go into it. 
    I say that a mere letter is not a basis. 
    If the government thinks it's a basis it looks at -- it looks at the kind of house the man lives in from the outside, it tries to get such superficial evidence as it can get, but it can't act and ask the Court to enforce summons. 
    It can issue a summons if it wants to, but if the taxpayer objects, then the Court must have a hearing and there's an obligation on what the government must show and this is what Congress intended to protect against. 
    This is why Congress put on the government the burden of proving fraud. 
    This is why all these cases say you must show a suspicion of fraud. 
    It isn't automatic that the government ought to have the right to examine each citizen for fraud. 
    It's automatic that it has the right to examine each citizen's return and we must remember that, Mr. Justice Goldberg how plenary is the authority of the government in the first three years and it uses this plenary authority. 
    Now to please the Court, as I left the Court yesterday and this is my last point, I thought what could be said to counter the force and the specific facts of the history that I related to Your Honors yesterday of the practices and the decisions under them, certainly, it can't be said that the statute is not clear. 
    Certainly that they're not old. 
    Certainly it can't be said the treasury department has ever asked for an amendment or that Congress has made an amendment and I say it cannot be asserted that the Government has not used this very test and I just quote one case to Your Honors Martin against Chandis back in 1942 where the Court said, "It is appellants, that's government's, contention that the only showing required and we assume also that the only contention required is" and I quote the government's contention, “a showing of probable cause sometimes called reasonable ground for suspicion of fraud.” 
    That's right in the decision of the Court. 
    Therefore, the only possible confusion that might result this from language used in cases, and I discount the Second Circuit for the moment, where the holdings are contrary to some of the language. 
    In older cases where they talk about the Fourth Amendment where the taxpayer raises the defense of fraud. 
    In newer cases, few of them where they talk about Oklahoma Press and Morton Salt, which Your Honors will recall is a case -- are cases where there were challenges under -- constitutional challenges under Fourth and Fifth Amendment, where it was assumed that the statutory authority existed. 
    For example, in the first part of De Masters, and that's the only one I can say to Your Honor Judge Browning's case, there is language in which he rejects probable cause as a test citing Oklahoma Press and Morton Press. 
    But then what does he go on to do? 
    First, he shows the difference in the authority of the commissioner in the three years and thereafter. 
    Second, he goes on to show the -- that after the bar the burden had shifted. 
    Third, he just demonstrates the dichotomy of 7605 (b) showing that there are two distinct prohibitions, and the first, no one necessary investigation is mandatory is the word he uses and then he establishes his test. 
    That reminds me if Your Honors please, of Mr. Justice Jackson's favorite quotation from Byron and Julia saying, she never would consent, consented because eventually what he holds is and I quote him, "The decision to investigate a innate of that purpose, namely to ascertain whether a suspicion of fraud is present, was in fact reached as a matter of rational judgment based on the circumstances of particular case” which wipes out the language as it does in the other cases.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I think your -- the governments' first point to the Court is that they -- it doesn't need to say anything other than the -- well this material -- these records are material in relevance. 
    You don't need to say that we suspect fraud as we made the investigation and certainly don't have to show in fact. 
    It's just to say there are no statute of limitations on fraud and we can search for fraud anytime, just like that we can search for anything else more than three years and runs to another matter and what's your answer to that anyway? 
    I think there's no statute of limitations on fraud, why shouldn't the government be able to search for fraud anytime, just like it could search for anything else within the three years and not constructed to the Act, the word necessary doesn't make -- it doesn't mean anymore after three years in connection with fraud, does the word necessary means before the three years of everything else?

    Mr. Bernard G. Segal 
    Oh, I think that's a very good statement Your Honor of the government's position. 
    It flies in the face of the Congressional purpose from the beginning of our government that when fraud is alleged, the government has a special burden. 
    There is -- are civil rules of procedure, all of the statutes, every time that fraud is alleged by the government, the burden changes. 
    If the government --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but the Government hasn't alleged anything, so that we don't have to until we've searched and we can go around and search any body's records for fraud at anytime?
speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="844.354" stopTime="847.709">
    Mr. Bernard G. Segal

    They must allege to come in --

    Mr. Bernard G. Segal 
    Well, the point that I make Your Honor is it if you read these statutes and you read their purpose, if you start with 6501 which certainly as the Courts have said marks a demarcation, he can't assess after the three years unless he finds fraud. 
    Now this --

    He can search for it, but when he asked the Court to enforce a summons, then he's got to show the Court some reason for calling on the Court under an adversary hearing in view of the inter-relation of these statutes when Congress put in the provision that there shall be no unnecessary examination, he would have to concede that an examination is unnecessary, if there's no suspicion of fraud. 
    It has to concede that.

    I don't believe the collector will ever say that he would start an examination after a three-year period unless he had the suspicion of fraud. 
    The real issue here is, whether he can blindly assert that in spite of what this Court has said in the Reisman case as to what the hearing is for, in spite of what these statute say, whether he can say to the Court, you just enforce it on my assertion and I say to Your Honor that over the years that has not been the position the government took, it's for some reason --

    Let me restate what the government's position is again. 
    We do take the position, Mr. Justice White that we do not have to suspect fraud. 
    Now as a matter of practice, we don't do that. 
    I indicated yesterday that we don't do random sampling.

    That's right. 
    Except for -- it's impractical and I think it would be a burden on taxpayers and we do not do it. 
    Now, our alternative theory is it's enough to have an affidavit saying we suspect fraud and that is of course, what is done in this case. 
    And the problem of whether that issue is now in the case because it wasn't included in the petition I think is hardly a serious one because that exact issue was in our petition and the question in the petition is broad enough to cover it.

    That is the point or one of the points of our case.

    That exact issue was made, not only in constitutional terms but in statutory terms.

    That's right Your Honor. 
    I may say -- let me turn to this business about the change in the government's position. 
    The fact of the matter is the government didn't have a position until very recently. 
    There were only a half dozen cases over 30 years and the US attorneys handled them as they thought best, which meant essentially the District Court thought that so much evidence would be necessary. 
    The US attorney tried to supply that much evidence. 
    Now in the last few years, particularly since the First Circuit Rule came into effect this of course has started a rash of litigation. 
    Immediately then the government sat down and said, "We've got to come up with a position". 
    Obviously, there's going to be a lot of litigation in this subject that position is the one that we're arguing here. 
    That's why we stood on the affidavit in this case, because we want to establish that principle. 
    If we're going to have full trials of these cases then we're in difficulty and I think the difficulty is shown by this case.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="1841.713" stopTime="1946.740">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Now, let me point to the hardship to the Government. 
    I think this case is an excellent example. 
    Here, the Government didn't have to show fraud when this summon was issued. 
    We could have shown 25% under statement of income. 
    Now, what's happened because of the delay from this litigation we can't assess for under statement of income. 
    Now, we have to show fraud. 
    Now, Mr. Segal can say, "Yes we've got this heavier burden. 
    "We didn't have it originally. 
    Well, this is a marvelous opportunity for taxpayers. 
    Before we can really get into an investigation we're blocked at the start with a full trial, it would amount to a miniature trial, an appeal ultimately in this Court and we haven't even gotten a chance to investigate. 
    Now, he says, well all we had to do is make some showing. 
    What's obvious that it wasn't just some showing that was required, because he says that an anonymous letter isn't enough. 
    In addition to that he says, "Well, Mr. Powell would have complied if there been some showing." 
    Well that's a very curious statement, because in a different case involving one of Mr. Klein's enterprises which Mr. Segal cites in his brief, the government served a summons on Mr. Powell, he refused to comply. 
    We went into the District Court, we produced the agent, we produced third party affidavits, we produced documentary evidence, he still didn't comply. 
    The District Court refused to enforce the summons, not on the ground we hadn't made a showing. 
    He said "We have. 
    We had in negative all the other possible explanations of the conduct of Mr. Klein”. 
    Now, these are the kinds of cases we're having and I don't think it takes any great stretch of imagination to see that this is a serious hardship from the Government which interferes with our investigations.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the Court of Appeals in its opinion, take them if you will, said this of course a Court is always free to ensure and investigate any question of bad faith and yeah as I understand it, you did not quarrel at all?

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Oh, no. 
    We don't -- the business of inquiry into good faith, we definitely accept that. 
    The question is only the procedures. 
    I'm told by the way we would produce the agent.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I've looked at the regulations and they are general Your Honor. 
    They are specific regulations on reopening cases and on giving the statutory notices under Section 7605(b) and those regulations say, I don't think they are actually regulations or instructions, they state that there has to be suspicion of fraud, indication of a substantial tax liability or some other important administrative reason.

    For reopening a case.

    But there is nothing that's in your regulation that could have misled a taxpayer to believe that you had to do this.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Oh, no, no there is no -- and I as I say the Forester case and Globe Construction are quite clear than an affidavit is sufficient so he wasn't misled.
