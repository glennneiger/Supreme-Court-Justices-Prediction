    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court. 
    This is sit-in case here on certiorari from Tennessee's highest court. 
    Petitioners are 8 young Negro college men whose liberty is at stake because they attempted to eat at a white only cafeteria in Nashville in October 21, 1962 and remained standing at the entrance vestibule after the doorman had barred their way because of their race. 
    They were convicted of conspiracy by a jury which agreed on a fine of less than $50 although empowered to find on as much as a $1,000. 
    The trial judge imposed the fine -- the $50 fine and added a 90-day work house sentence. 
    Their claims that their conduct was constitutionally protected were rejected on appeal for the state's highest court.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    There is a procedure for a defendant to request that if you done more trial that was not done. 
    This Court granted certiorari in the case before its decisions in Hamm v. Rock Hill and Blow v. North Carolina holding that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 abated all pending prosecutions for non-forcible attempt to enter or remain in establishments covered by the Act. 
    Now, this case does not merely involve the liberty of these young men for by its arguments here, Tennessee is attempting, we think to nullify the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by criminal prosecutions brought under a law which the Tennessee Supreme Court itself admitted was originally enacted in 1875 to nullify the Civil Rights Act of 1875 dealing with the public accommodations. 
    Now we make six somewhat related arguments, and I'd like to state them briefly now as I probably will not have the opportunity to argue them all. 
    First, we make an abatement argue based on Hamm against Rock Hill. 
    Second, we make a state action racial discrimination argument premised on Lombard versus Louisiana and Robinson against Florida among other cases. 
    Third, we make an argument that there's no evidence either of a conspiracy to obstruct the restaurant or of a conspiracy to call the riot two of the things -- two of the several things charged in the indictment and we rely -- we rely on the Thompson versus Louisville doctrine. 
    Fourth, we urged that there was error in instructions to the jury which invited the jury to convict on various unconstitutional grounds. 
    Including among others, an erroneous instruction about the statutes the defendants were accused of violating. 
    Trial Judge told the jury three times that the defendants were charged with violating the law which they were not -- they were not accused of. 
    And also whether the -- that the trial—
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="258.661" stopTime="263.374">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They charged the jury with something they were not -- didn't get the last word.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="263.374" stopTime="531.086">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes. 
    The trial judge three times during his instructions to the jury told the jury that these defendants were accused of a conspiracy to violate Section 62-710 of the Tennessee laws which I'll describe in a moment but this is a section briefly that abrogates the common law (Inaudible) and this wasn't true. 
    The State Court held that was error but said it didn't see how it could affect the judgment of the jury. 
    And the other related matters, the fact that the accusation read to the jury as part of the instructions asserted the petitioners went to the restaurant with one of the things they're accused of is going to the restaurant knowing that other people like patrons might attack them. 
    Fifth, we make an argument based on Cole against Arkansas that the Appellant Court rested its affirmance on a theory of what the crime was which was completely contrary to the theory on which the case was tried and litigated and submitted to the jury. 
    And sixth, there's an argument that the jurors were not impartial with respect to the segregation issue which was central to the case. 
    Now on the first point, the Hamm v. Rock Hill issue abatement question. 
    There is apparently no dispute about the fact that Title II of the Civil Rights Act covers the BMW Cafeteria. 
    State's brief apparently assumes this and we think correctly so. 
    This restaurant is a large 450-seat cafeteria located in Nashville's downtown business district open to the general public and offering to serve interstate travelers, we think within the meaning of Section 201 C2 of the Civil Rights Act. 
    Also the fact of racial discrimination is undisputed on the evidence and indeed admitted on the face of the grand jury's presenter but the State contends that petitioners are not detected by the Act on the ground that their conduct was not peaceful and asserts that their acts were criminal even if they had a right to eat at the restaurant. 
    There are several answers to this. 
    At first, the case wasn't tried on this basis and the accusation wasn't made obviously. 
    The case was -- accusation proceeded on the theory that the restaurant had a right to exclude these petitioners under a Tennessee law has to give them that right and this was a whole theory of the case in the Trial Court. 
    I'm going to talk about the accusation statutes involved and the judge's instructions to the jury and in describing pretending to keep in mind that the scope of -- we submit the scope of abatement under the Civil Rights Act. 
    The scope of its protection is the same as the scope of present protection for people who commit acts there under the -- in establishments covered by the act. 
    Now the accusation mentioned three statutes which are set out in our brief and the federal courts petitioners' brief of pages 4 and 5. 
    The first of the statutes is the conspiracy law Section 39-1101 subsection 7 prohibits a conspiracy to commit any act injurious to public health, public morals, trade of commerce. 
    The indictment alleged the petitioners inspired to injure the trade of business with a BMW Cafeteria in Nashville. 
    Now, the next two statutes—

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    At the moment, Your Honor, I was just attempting to describe the accusation and to point out to the statute to various statutes they were accused of violating in this indictment which was really a one count indictment. 
    There was no -- there were no separate charges under these -- these various statutes, it was just the one overall charge.

    Is that the violation of?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="609.009" stopTime="732.228">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes sir, well I can read it. 
    It's at the top of the second page of the record. 
    And it says that the defendants conspired to violate code section 39-1101 7 that is the Conspiracy Law and Section 62-711. 
    Now Section 62-711 and the preceding Section 62-710 where Sections 1 and 2 of a single statute passed by Tennessee in March 1874 are the first section abrogated common law duty of innkeepers to serve all commerce, so they could exclude anyone and the second section which prohibits turbulent or right of conduct was designed to enforce the first section. 
    And this is the law, I mentioned earlier which a contemporary Tennessee Supreme Court of 1877 asserted was passed to avoid the effects of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. 
    This law was passed. 
    These two sections were enacted three weeks after the Federal Civil Rights Act that the comparison of them confirms that statement of the purpose. 
    They cover the same types of facilities indeed the Federal Act had a $500 penalty against discriminating proprietary and the Tennessee statute turned it around but with $500 civil penalty against a person who attempted to remain in an establishment after being screwed. 
    Now the accusation runs from pages 2 to 5 of the records were at length embraces a great number of different theories.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="732.228" stopTime="733.199">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Great number of what?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="733.199" stopTime="809.163">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Of different theories, Your Honor. 
    It starts out by describing what this restaurant is and then it asserts that the restaurant had a policy of serving white people only and that this policy was adapted under the statute under Section 62 710. 
    And this is the way in which that second law is brought into the accusation but it's not charged and they violated expressly. 
    It's charged that the restaurant had a right under the statute to exclude Negroes because of race. 
    And that the petitioners went to the restaurant conspired to conduct sit in affairs at white only restaurants knowing that they wouldn't be served. 
    Then after being charged as further that after being denied service, they conspired of blocking the entrance and charges that they did this knowing that their mere presence there was likely to provoke patrons of the segregated cafeteria to start a fight or riot and that they were these petitioners were engaged in a movement to compel such restaurant integrating against their policies about them under this law.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes sir. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="909.244" stopTime="1007.680">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If I follow you correctly -- if I follow your brief, the resentment here charged the violation of 39-1101 which is a conspiracy statute and finding it to commit any act injurious to public health, public morals, trade or commerce. 
    And then it charged the violation of 62-711 penalty for riotous conduct. 
    It did not charge although it referred to the 62-710 which defined a right of owners to exclude persons from places of public accommodation. 
    Now one of your points, I take on your brief and what you've just said is that when the Court charged at page 299, it said that the language of the resentment that the defendants are charged with the offense of the lawful conspiracy to violate code section 39-1017 code section 62-710 and 62-711. 
    And you're arguing -- one of your arguments I think it is that there was no charge of conspiracy to deprive one of the right which the statute 62-710 purported to give to an owner a right to exclude persons from places of public accommodation. 
    And therefore under Court of Arkansas there couldn't be convicted because they were being convicted of a charge which was not lodged against it. 
    Is that a correct statement of the position of that point?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1007.680" stopTime="1188.838">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, sir it is. 
    And I would point out that the reference, Your Honor, mentioned on page 299 was only the first of three times the Court told them -- told the jury that the defendants were charged under this statute. 
    The other second times under the bottom of 302 and the third time is over on page 305. 
    Now I think it's important to know about this accusation is the defendants were not charged with disorderly conduct or breach of the peace. 
    Disorderly conduct or breach of the peace under Tennessee law Section 39-1213 carries only a 30 day sentence whereas the defendants were charged with conspiracy carrying the possible year in jail and a thousand dollar fine. 
    And they were not charged with violating 62-711 directly that only carried a fine. 
    They were charged with a conspiracy to violate. 
    Now we submit that the -- on the abatement argument that the conviction should be reversed just on the face of the accusation because certainly under the Ham case any such accusation as this, if it were filed on the Court today would be obviously fatally defective under the Civil Rights and it's totally a consistent with the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and there was no pretense here as there would -- as there has been in some of the sit-in cases which has come before this Court that something other than racial discrimination was involved here. 
    It's on the face of the accusation. 
    And the same observation, I think applies to the judge's instructions to the jury. 
    He read the whole resentment with implicit approval to the grand jury. 
    He told they made this mistake three times about the statute and then he explained the conspiracy. 
    He explained what a conspiracy to commit acts injurious to a business was in these terms at page 300. 
    He said that injurious, page 300 of the record. 
    He said that injurious in this context led an invasion or violation of a legally protected interest or property right. 
    So this invited the jury to convey that merely if it believed that the complainants remain in the restaurant against his wishes. 
    And now we -- and again, an instruction that -- that's contrary to the theory of the Civil Rights Act or the Hampton. 
    I think, the second overall answer to the state's claim—
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1188.838" stopTime="1231.846">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can I ask you a question please before you leave that other -- what is the ACP's origin of the Civil Rights Act of ‘64 in this regard? How much self help is a Negro entitled to use in attempts to enter a restaurant to secure service which the Act is in the right to have when he approaches a restaurant and he's met at the door by a private bouncer who says you can't come in. 
    How much self helf at that point the Negro is entitled to use?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1231.846" stopTime="1258.936">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    We certainly agree I think with the statement in the Hamm decision that he cannot violently remain there or attempt to enter but he can find its way in. 
    And I was just about to come to the facts of this case and to argue that the -- there is no evidence here which supports this -- what we think was the very unfair characterization of these petitioner's conduct is then un-peaceful.

    As I said, 18 people did manage to go through while these petitioners were standing. 
    But in that situation, I would -- I would say that the policy of the Civil Rights Act prevails over any incidental injury to the business which is attended upon the manager's discriminatory action in violation of the Act.

    I guess they could have fought their way to come in but they didn't.

    And I take it that you correctly appeal and what you're saying is that they didn't need to get congregated in the vestibule. 
    They met under Section 202 of this Act applies to seek service. 
    And then the deprivation occurred under Section 203. 
    And then it is the persons denied them or instructed them in their right to seek service. 
    And then you joined to these statutes in our Hamm decision. 
    Do you say that that was an abatement? 
    Would that be a correct description of what you're trying to say?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1671.682" stopTime="1756.795">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, Your Honor, that is. 
    And then entirely apart from the abatement argument, we argue that Cole v. Arkansas requires a reversal. 
    The Tennessee Court said it was considering the case stripped of any questions of race and discrimination so the act of complaint was still unlawful. 
    They -- they made an arguendo or assumption that the defendants had a right to go in the premises solely. 
    They didn't assume that they had the right to stay there. 
    But -- and then the trial court examined the evidence and concluded that there was evidence the defendants committed a breach of the peace. 
    Well, this was exactly an opposite theory upon which the case was – that upon which the case was submitted to the jury. 
    The jury was never told that the proprietor was wrong and these defendants had a right to stay there, and it's totally opposite. 
    There was no charge of a breach of the peace as I mentioned that carried a penalty 112 of the penalty they were liable to. 
    Most importantly, I think the defense would have been different if there had been a charge that these defendants having a lawful right to enter nevertheless, it was illegal means of self help.

    Mr. Nabrit, I have to quarrel here a little bit, if you look at page 311 of the record, did not the court submitted a revised chart to a jury saying that leading it was not a criminal offense to the State of Tennessee for Negro and white persons who serve food together who entered into a criminal offense for Negroes to peaceably seek to be served food in the place which offered the service to the general public?

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes sir, it did. 
    But what the trial court also did was -- that was a revision of the actual requested instruction which appears on page 307 -- the material in brackets on 307 is the material that the Court refused to instruct and he refused to instruct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1805.381" stopTime="1825.601">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And what was then -- what was then the defect in the Court's instruction? 
    The Court said that these defendants had a right to peaceably to seek service and it's not a criminal offense for whites to have them together. 
    Now what was the element to support in your opinion omitted?

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    Another point, I just wanted to clear. 
    Your point is that the conduct here on this record would be conduct which today would be lawful under the Civil Rights Act. 
    And therefore under the policy of abatement would also be also be lawful at the time it occurred, is that it? 
    And your -- well how did you -- do you get or raise any constitutional claim on this one?

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    An additional argument. 
    Well, we have an argument based on Lombard versus Louisiana and Robinson against Florida that specifically relates to the Tennessee Act to prosecute it under which was designed to encourage segregation. 
    And we made reference in our reply brief at page 9 to administrative regulation which required segregation of restaurants and this was the regulation that's quoted in this Court's opinion in Turner versus Memphis --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1952.785" stopTime="1953.380">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the same line?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1953.380" stopTime="2055.851">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    And held invalid, that regulation was held invalid by this Court a few months before this event took place. 
    But we submit that the theory of the Robinson case at least as much state involvement as it was in the Robinson case. 
    Now, I left the last point a bit too early. 
    One of the thing I wanted to mention was that, if the defendants had been apprised that trial of the State's theory that the -- that the State argues now right to be there but it acted then, then perhaps the counsel would have had entirely different case. 
    He would have been -- he wouldn't have been able to rely on his Fourteenth Amendment state action argument. 
    And he might have thought of necessary to put on the defendants to testify and deny this case. 
    But a decision not to do that was made under an entirely different case. 
    In conclusion, I would submit that the actions of these petitioners were not materially different from the actions of the petitioners in 25 other sit-in cases. 
    Now this Court has reversed to vacate convictions in the past four terms.

   Argument of Thomas E. Fox
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="2118.595" stopTime="2283.295">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Indictment in this case refers to it as a sit-in case. 
    I submit that that is not exactly correct because this is not a sit-in case or if it were a sit-in case, we wouldn't have any case under the Arthur Hamm versus Rock Hill case and under the Blow versus North Carolina. 
    We insist that the conduct of the defendants in this case was violent, turbulent, and righteous, in accordance with the definition that was set out in the case of Feiner versus New York or in the case of Senn v. Tile Layers Union that came along, I believe just prior to 1940. 
    In those -- from those definitions especially the Tile case, we understand that that acts are violent, that acts are not peaceful that they're forceful and not non-forceful as referred to in the Hamm case, if physical force is used in order to accomplish the purpose of the people making the demonstrations or the people that were charged with the offense. 
    Now in this case, as was stated by my worthy opponent, there is a vestibule at the BMW Cafeteria in Nashville Tennessee which is from the evidence from about 6 feet by 6 feet or 6 feet by 4 feet. 
    The witnesses disagree or differ a little bit as to size of this vestibule. 
    On Sunday at noon at the time when there's a big crowd of people eating at the restaurant, these eight petitioners who were defendants originally came to that restaurant. 
    They say for the purpose of acquiring food. 
    They moved into the vestibule, the eight of them, and I submit that that just about filled it and were confronted with the doorman to the effect that this -- that the restaurant only served white people and that they couldn't' be served, and they were asked to leave. 
    They didn't leave. 
    They didn't say anything out of the way. 
    My opponents insist that they were peaceful. 
    We think that we insist that -- or I insist that there being there in the vestibule preventing people from leaving or entering the restaurant at will and there is an onset some entered and some left. 
    Some had to squeeze through. 
    Some had to make them after they get them, the eight petitioners to move over before they could -- before they could move at—

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    This statute 39-1101 is a conspiracy statute. 
    It has seven parts the -- these defendants. 
    The conspiracy was charged under the letter. 
    That is a statement or requirement. 
    It requires that acts be injurious to trade. 
    Now the other section of the code that was talked about is 62-711, one of the other sections the Court just talked about. 
    That section of the code makes it unlawful for any person to engage in turbulent or riotous conduct about a restaurant or hotel. 
    It I think on the indictment is no more than the overt act that is necessary to show a conspiracy and that statute, that overt act must be a turbulent riotous act in order to constitute the conspiracy in this case. 
    There have been certain -- there has been only one conviction under the later section, the court mentioned 62-711 that was the Lester case that my opponent mentioned. 
    That was the case where an indictment was motion to caution indictment which was granted by the trial judge was reversed by our Supreme Court back in 1877. 
    The statute was enacted in 1875. 
    The Court observed in that opinion and I don't have any way of -- I went back to the archive to find out whether or not this defendant in the Lester case was a Negro or whether he was a white person. 
    I wasn't able to ascertain that fact but the Court observed this. 
    They said that this Act is generally supposed to have been enacted to offset the results or the effects of the Civil Rights Act that was passed by the United States Congress in 1875. 
    No, I don't say that it was intended to nullify that act and I don't think that our Supreme Court in 1875 would have said or in 1877 in our legislature in 1875 would have enacted a statute to nullify an act of Congress. 
    I think the legislature could proceed that because of the Civil Rights Act that was passed by Congress in 1875 that there would be some turbulent conduct. 
    There would be some -- some -- some people that were unhappy about the situation. 
    And I think this Act was adopted for the purpose of enabling the owner of the restaurant of the hotel to deal with the situation without regard to color of the skin. 
    That if any person were there in the premise of the hotel or the restaurant acting in a turbulent or riotous way that the owner of the hotel would have a right to bring an action against him not only a criminal offense but also to bring a civil action against him for damages.

    Your Honor please, they were charged that if they conspired to injure the trade of the BMW Cafeteria, by entering into turbulent or riotous conduct that they, of course, would have made out the defense. 
    Now I believe that's in substance of what the statement of the elements of the offense -- the essential elements of the offense were. 
    I like to say this about the statute 62-710 the Civil Statute that a good deal has been set about.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    62-710 that is the Civil Rights or Civil Statute that abrogated common law rule to authorize the owner of a hotel or restaurant to treat it I believe as his own private place of abode that he could let in or otherwise people according to his own choosing. 
    That section is included in the indictment. 
    We insist -- or the State of Tennessee insists that the purpose of including that was to show to help show a conspiracy, a conspiracy, of course, under the law in our State and I think on the rules that are set down by this Court can be determined from the circumstances from the relationship of the parties and other circumstances of that sort even though there is no formal agreement. 
    Well, this statute the purpose of stating the contents of that statute in the indictment was for the purpose of showing that these defendants had in mind. 
    They knew about the situations of restaurant it has alleged an indictment that was generally known and it says in the indictment that they were sit-in cases occurring at other restaurants so that is one of the elements of the conspiracy.

    If they remained there, I think it's, it couldn't have been -- you have to, you can't escape the conclusion that the blocked entrance had to remain there because it was 6x6 or 6x4 and there were 8 people in it. 
    And the proof does show that they effectively blocked, not effectively but blocked it to the point that people had some difficulty squeezing through. 
    There's a big group of people inside to point it out. 
    There's a big group outside.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    I have thought about that question considerably in the Hamm Case the Arthur Hamm Jr. versus Rock Hill and in the Elton Cox cases, I don't think the word turbulent is used but the word riotous and the word violent is used. 
    And although I could -- I thought we made those two terms are a little bit too vague to determine exactly what they meant. 
    Then I found that this Court had used those words. 
    And I think used them just in there ordinary sense. 
    And so we think we're entitled to that -- that same use of them or at least in this case that -- that those were -- that they were violent and riotous. 
    It's so well known what those two words mean.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir it seemed to be concede by my -- where the opponents that if these people had used force to push on through the door that they wouldn't be covered by the Hamm case. 
    And I think in the Elton Cox case that that that's really part of the holding in that case. 
    That if they use force to push on through, that they wouldn't be protected by the Civil Rights Act. 
    Now, I can't see any difference if the Court please in using force to push on through or using force to stand at a place that will eventually cause the owner to open the door and let them through.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    We think so under the holding in Ingram v. United States that was the tax case. 
    There it was said that -- well first American --the Tobacco Company v. United States. 
    There it was said that you infer the criminal act from the acts that we're doing. 
    You don't have to have an expression of it or anything of that such you infer from circumstances. 
    Now in the Ingram case, it was said that that if the conspiracy is not one of the major objectives but one of the minor that it no less is still a conspiracy that is punishable as I understand it. 
    In other words, I think that the defendant's first objective was to get in and be fed. 
    I don't think there's any question about that. 
    But when they were not, then they continued to remain in the vestibule and block it. 
    Now we think that was their second objective. 
    We think it was understood between these eight petitioners because of their conduct. 
    First, they all -- I think the record indicate that they all knew that they were not going to be permitted to enter that was common knowledge. 
    I think the record indicates that I maybe wrong but I think that's right. 
    I think that's really it was alleged. 
    That all happened there at the same time. 
    That all happened there at the time when the restaurant was crowded. 
    They all stayed. 
    They all performed as a unit or as a team throughout the whole incident. 
    There wasn't many questions about what one would do and what the other would do. 
    They all acted in concert but those are the words that I'm trying to use all the way through this proceeding. 
    So we think that the only inference that can be drawn from those circumstances, I thought is that they did act together and that they conspired to do the thing that they had done. 
    Now, I would like to mention this, the case of Turner v. Memphis that had to do with the house down at the airport at Memphis Tennessee. 
    As my opponents understand that case, they say that this Court declared Section 62-710 unconstitutional and a restaurant regulation that we had in effect at that time to be unconstitutional. 
    Well, I don't understand that case held that. 
    The case said this that there was a question of whether to proceed at that time or to wait I believe for construction of that code section and that restaurant regulation. 
    This Court said there was no use to see what the results that was because that statute and that regulation could only be a defense insofar as it's stated an affirmative state policy to segregate and they said under that and then added on their cases that there wouldn't be a defense because it just couldn't be done. 
    So we don't think the State declared them unconstitutional. 
    It just said that if they were sought to be used for that purpose of warning the acts of the restaurant and segregating it, that would be unconstitutional. 
    Now this -- in this reply brief is the first time that the restaurant regulation has been mentioned. 
    I take it that if it's a part of the law in Tennessee or if it were a part of the law the State could take, I mean this Court could take judicial notice of it. 
    At least this is the first time it's raised. 
    So I'm raising the question about whether or not it can be considered farther been the federal court. 
    I would say this that I don't know whether that regulation is part of the law or not it says this that when restaurants are open to both white and colored, they should be served separately. 
    And then it goes on to say that sets out some specifics that that would amount to a compliance with it. 
    Now that's the effect of it. 
    Well, I don't know whether that -- at the time whether that is -- has the force of law or not. 
    Of course a regulation that is designed for that purpose does have but I would like to say this that one mentioned.

    Well, that's the way, we treated it the statutes is now authorized a division of inspection so far the issue of such rule and regulation and make violation for such regulation for misdemeanor and the regulation promulgated by the division provides that you just read. 
    Restaurants catering to both white and negro patrons should be arranged till each race was properly segregated and we certainly treated it in that case but what would some concession on the court of Tennessee in that case, it should be so treated at least on the part of the -- I should say as a statute of general applicability.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If the court please first, I don't know that this regulation requires that from the wording of it.

    It shows a policy doesn't it as far as segregation and record.

    I thought that on this report that your brief took the position that a conspiracy is different from individual actions which left me in somewhat of quandary have I misread your brief?

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    I believe so if I understand your question. 
    If the Court that Mr. Justice Black further in response to your question, I think this that under the Hamm case, even though that -- maybe I'm going too far but I don't understand that a man is permitted to take the law in his own hands.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4209.103" stopTime="4211.678">

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If the court please this would be my answer to it and I said it hadn't been construed but I think that the department of hotel and restaurants or the people in the charge of it might have been suggesting that it would be encouraged in order to prevent emotional flair ups and things of that sort.

    I went back and read that.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well Mr. Fox, I take it that you concede that well maybe you don't concede it but if these events had happened after the passage in 1964 Civil Rights Act, I take it you would still be here on the same theory namely that while the negroes had a right to service they didn't have the right to this kind of self help.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4318.629" stopTime="4319.150">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4319.150" stopTime="4320.988">

    You would be making the same argument.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4320.988" stopTime="4321.946">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4321.946" stopTime="4326.414">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you then consequently make the same argument as far as abatement is concerned.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4326.414" stopTime="4326.558">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4326.558" stopTime="4372.489">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Consequently, I would think you would make the identical argument in regard to Peterson and Lombard because those statutes, those holders certainly do anymore for a negro seeking service in the Civil Rights Act and whatever Peterson Lombard was to give the Negroes the right to do and what are their ever freedom from state compulsion, it wouldn't give them a freedom to use a particular degree or brand of self help and so all the questions reduce to the same issue was there the kind of conduct by the negroes here which took them outside the protection of either Civil Rights Act of 64 or Peterson or Lombard, isn't that really the question?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4372.489" stopTime="4373.423">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes that's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4373.423" stopTime="4411.191">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now let me ask you one other thing. 
    The indictment here in this case charges that the defendant formed a block within the vestibule was any customers and patrons from the street from coming out that said conspirator did further attempts to force their way inside the main cafeteria section did push around and shove white patrons therein which conduct continues to appear more in 30 minutes. 
    Now is there any evidence to support that charge.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4411.191" stopTime="4412.328">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir, we think.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4412.328" stopTime="4418.275">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did the Supreme Court of Alabama think that that's true? Tennessee?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4418.275" stopTime="4430.074">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir, I think though that our supreme court said that I think in their opinion that this respect that if this one violent conduct or if this one the use of physical force then the case ought to be reversed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4430.074" stopTime="4443.685">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the trial court never charged the jury at all, that it was essential to find any kind of turbulence of violent conduct. 
    The only -- this case instructed on was the injurious to trade.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4443.685" stopTime="4444.214">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir.

    Isn't that correct?

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir I think that's correct. 
    We have compared that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4450.076" stopTime="4460.949">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You agree and Supreme Court of Alabama currently or Tennessee, excuse me agreed there must be some turbulent conduct if you think.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4460.949" stopTime="4461.862">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Some use of physical force.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4461.862" stopTime="4464.482">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say that that is essential?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4464.482" stopTime="4465.290">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir. 
    We think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4465.290" stopTime="4468.024">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That it wasn't submitted to the jury?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4468.024" stopTime="4471.563">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If the court please we think that it was mainly.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4471.563" stopTime="4473.552">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You tried to find out once before that—
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4473.552" stopTime="4491.384">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Where were the instructions focused in this sentence? 
    Juror, you must find that this conduct was turbulent or riotous before you may bring in a verdict of guilt where does that appear anywhere in the instruction?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4491.384" stopTime="4528.572">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The only thing the judge keeps saying that you must find that these defendants did confederate unlawfully to commit acts injurious to the restaurant business, trade and commerce but that's -- and you said that two or three times without ever saying that turbulence or violence is of any necessity in the case at all?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4528.572" stopTime="4540.126">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If the Court please, I didn't understand your -- I don't think I understood your question at first but I do now and I'm looking forward I'm not sure that it is an instruction.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4540.126" stopTime="4545.316">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, assume that it isn't what difference does that make?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4545.316" stopTime="4561.203">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If the Court please, in reading Section 62-711, I think that would have effect of the instruction. 
    It says that the — it defines what is meant by an act injurious to trade and that was read by the Court, the trial judge to the jury.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4561.203" stopTime="4565.804">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that's true but that doesn't have anything to do with violence or physical conduct?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4565.804" stopTime="4570.712">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    If Your Honor please, we think that when you say turbulent or riotous that means violence.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4570.712" stopTime="4572.761">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And where is that?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4572.761" stopTime="4582.763">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    The passage that I'm referring to is at 298 where it says the person guilty of turbulent or riotous conduct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4582.763" stopTime="4585.153">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well that's just the reading of the statute.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4585.153" stopTime="4590.989">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir. 
    It says that's what they're charged with the violation of statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4590.989" stopTime="4592.656">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's as close as you can go?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4592.656" stopTime="4600.852">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    I would think that's as close as the trial judge got to it. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4600.852" stopTime="4618.949">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But now did the Alabama or the Tennessee Supreme Court -- what does it conclude about this conduct? 
    They characterize it as they make a finding that on this record they were guilty of some kind of force?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4618.949" stopTime="4638.180">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir. 
    I think, I can find it on page 324 and 325. 
    It says, “We cannot escape the fact these eight defendants were blocking the entrance of the doorway.” 
    And we think that by blocking is equivalent to saying they used physical force.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4638.180" stopTime="4653.682">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But they never think that the evidence supports the charges in the indictment that they were trying to force their way into the restaurant or that they were pushing white customers around? Does anybody ever in either court indicate that, that actually occurred?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4653.682" stopTime="4659.828">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir. 
    I think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4659.828" stopTime="4675.654">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What judge ever found out -- page 317 says that the evidence shows the blocking and that blocking and in blocking the defendants were pushing and shoving to some extent?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="4675.654" stopTime="4677.619">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes sir, 316 and 317
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4677.619" stopTime="4679.486">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In an effort to enter the restaurant?
