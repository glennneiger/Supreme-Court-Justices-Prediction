   Argument of Ralph L. Roy
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="15.059" stopTime="17.512">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Roy.
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="17.512" stopTime="191.270">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case involves a prosecution on Louisiana statute, annotated revised statute, Section 4 -- Title XIV, Section 401, which is an identical counterpart of a Federal Act to be founded 18 U.S.C. 1507. 
    Substantially, these Acts prohibit the picketing, operating in or near courthouse or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by a judge, juror, witness or court official with the intent of interfering with obstructing or impeding the administration of justice or with the intent of influencing any such official. 
    As I understood the appellant's argument yesterday, understanding to be first that although he recognizes the right of the State to pass such a law, that the Louisiana Supreme Court and the Louisiana lower court applied an unconstitutional standard or in effect did not apply this clear and present danger standard. 
    Although there is no litigative history on the state, nor this federal statute, appellant relies upon the history of cases dealing with contempt of court cases wherein it was overt and that there was an infringement on the right of speech, free speech and freedom of the press. 
    These cases of course deal per se with freedom of speech and freedom of press. 
    These contempt cases too that counsel have -- has cited. 
    As pointed out by the State's Supreme Court, and as it's known by everyone, picketing factually is not the equivalent of speech. 
    And consequently, as this Court has said, it is not equal in legal equivalent.

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Well, first of all, I think this so-called arrangement here is quite immaterial because I don't think and I know of no law which generally justifies an officer in permitting or authorizing another to violate the law. 
    Now, I think this question -- this question of -- of authority was in part in the cases -- in one of the cases yesterday, into the breach of peace case, because in that case, one of the elements was to refuse to disburse on the oath of an officer. 
    Now, in that sense, authorization would be relevant but authorization to commit crime by an officer or anyone else; would only make him an accomplice. 
    It would not justify or legalize the act, otherwise, criminal. 
    Now, if I may Your Honor, cite from the record. 
    And before I do -- frankly, I'm not -- I'm not exactly sure what the record is up here. 
    On page 4 of -- of appellant's brief, down at the bottom --

    Yes sir, but I have a -- a very facts copy. 
    I've never been -- been furnished with any printed brief. 
    So I've -- I've prepared my argument and my brief from what I've received, which is a rare facts copy of a consolidated brief. 
    Which I assumed is the same thing that you have printed --

    No sir, it's my first time I've seen it. 
    Now, whether our page numbers correlate, I don't know. 
    But I would like to point something out on the brief I have of appellant's consolidated brief on page 4. 
    At the bottom, there's a asterisk which says and I quote. 
    The transcript of the trial in the District Court made by a court stenographer is not physically a part of the record prepared by the clerk of the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    To supplement the records, the transcript of the minutes of the trial which has been submitted to this Court is referred by the symbol T. 
    Now, of course the minutes -- the transcript of the minutes, do not include the transcript of the evidence that was taken down in the trial court although the appellant in his brief refers frequently to the transcript taken by the court stenographer in the trial court. 
    Now, I understand from the opposing counsel that -- that the transcript of the evidence has been filed with the clerk, although, it was not sent up by the clerk of the Supreme Court.

    Now as you may recall, this congregation gathered, at the old State Capitol grounds which is approximately two blocks from the courthouse. 
    The first officer, to talk to appellant, was the chief criminal deputy of the sheriff -- of the Sheriff's office of east Baton Rouge Parish. 
    Here's his testimony, the transcript of the trial court page 253, and I quote, And I asked him the purpose of the demonstration --, this is Chief Kling talking about his conversation with Cox. 
    And I asked him the purpose of the demonstration, he told me that he and these people were demonstrating in the protest of the illegal arrest of some of their people who have been held and jailed. 
    I asked him if he didn't think the court was the proper place to decide the legality of the arrest. 
    And I told him further that the accumulation of those people there, creating an explosive situation, wouldn't that could erupt into serious trouble and I asked him to disband them and take them back from whence they came. 
    Question: Did he acquiesce in your request? 
    He did not. 
    And he said, I told him the second time. 
    I asked him to disperse the people in interest of peace and harmony and he told me he was coming by the building referring to the court building. 
    And I told him then that if any of violence resulted, I felt that it would be his responsibility whether he say, he said no, it would be the police officer's responsibility that as an officer, that he was duly to bound to protect him and the other people.

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Yes sir. 
    Now, this was prior to a time that he talked to Chief White. 
    This was about one block from where he spoke to Chief White. 
    Now, after he started out toward the courthouse when he got about midway between from where he had left on the old State Capitol grounds to the courthouse, Chief White stopped him. 
    And at page 371 of this transcript, Chief White said with reference to this alleged authorization. 
    At that time, this is Chief White talking, At that time, I told him --, told Cox, That he was he was confined to the west side of the street. 
    This of course was not -- I didn't mean it -- in the import that I was given him any permission to do it, but I was presented with a situation that was accomplished and I had to make a decision and I made it in the best interest of community safety in my opinion. 
    And then at page 372, he says, as he started to leave, Captain Font -- this was an officer with Chief White, suggested to me that we find out from him, how long he intended to have this meeting. 
    And we called him back and he said that we would be there about seven minutes and then that they would return to the campus at Southern University. 
    At page 354 of this transcript, which includes the testimony -- some testimony of the sheriff, "I grabbed the power microphone, I didn't grab Sergeant (Inaudible) who was standing by and I took this power microphone and I said, You have been allowed to demonstrate. 
    Up until now, your demonstration has been more or less peaceful. 
    But what you are doing now is in -- is a direct violation of the law, it disturbs the peace and it has got to be broken up immediately.

    And some of the witnesses said the atmosphere was very thin. 
    One of them said, he thought they were going to storm the courthouse.

    All of this noise provoked the sheriff to say, Well, it's time, this is getting out of hand or worse to that effect. 
    And then the response, the sheriff, What did Cox do in response to that order about breaking it up. 
    Answer: He raised his hand -- hands in this manner or in this manner indicating he doesn't say. 
    I don't know which. 
    The tension was so great at that time. 
    I could be mistaken about the justice, but all through his talking, he was just articulating right and left -- right hand and left hand. 
    He said, Don't move, you know on certain times.

    Question: That was in response to your order, I order you to disperse? 
    Answer: Yes. 
    Did the crowd obey your order or the order of Cox? 
    They obeyed his order, their leader. 
    And what happened? 
    Two of my officers crossed the street and they said, you have heard what the sheriff said now, do what he said. 
    And again they suggested, I don't know whether the same words were said or not. 
    But the gesture of defiance to an officer's order at about that time, the first teargas was exploded to the crowd. 
    So the witnesses in other force of this transcript said that he nearly looked at the sheriff. 
    He said Don't move and turn the sheriff folded his arms.

    I remember that, didn't Cox also told what other witnesses testified too. 
    But apparently, from that I gather, and I think it can be gathered, it's probably clear, that he knew that these officers across the street had this teargas before they have started or during the speech.

    Now, this set of -- this transcript is as I've said about some 600 pages long and varies as the State Supreme Court said, they had ample evidence not only from the sheriff or the police officers but from other witnesses who happened to be around there to sustain this particular conviction.

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Well, they didn't call it a crime. 
    They of course called it freedom of speech and asserting their rights. 
    They had a meeting that evening and appellant was there and another official of CORE, Ronnie Moore, who didn't make it down to the courthouse because he was arrested and convicted which was upheld.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, you think the -- that the mere presence of these people at the place where they were at this time was a violation of the law?
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="1408.646" stopTime="1448.720">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Not this particular law because it requires not only their presence at this particular place in the manner suggested crowding or picketing in or near the courthouse, not only as that required but that also is required an intent to influence a court official or to impede the administration of justice. 
    This is required and we'll get this requirement from their proclaim design and object to go out there and protest this illegal arrest, as they call it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1448.720" stopTime="1457.829">

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    -- I think you have to utilize that to get the intent. 
    Of course, the intent is usually approved from circumstances. 
    And I think you have to consider that in order to deduct an intent to interfere with the administration of justice or interfere with some judge or some court official. 
    The trial judge where at great length and asking Ronnie Moore on the witness stand. 
    Why the courthouse? 
    Why did you come down here? 
    Why not on the old State Capitol grounds or some other part of town, some public park, why here? 
    And he says, Well if he is where they were arrested and we came to protest it, we came here. Well, what did you hope to gain by doing this? 
    What did you hope to gain?

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    As I said, I think so. 
    In fact, I feel rather sure they would because I know of no law that will grant immunity to a person who violates the law by virtue of the fact that some police officers acquiesce it or gave him permission.

    No, but as a matter of fact, they do and it is well recognized, is it not? 
    And the common practice where the police to regulate it that most cities have some kind of ordinance, giving them that authority to --
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="1647.893" stopTime="1720.887">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Well Your Honor, I think that this particular question that you are asking goes to the question of intent. 
    For example, if -- suppose an appellate and his followers, definitely intended to put a pressure, let's say political pressure. 
    As a matter of fact, the state or all the state officials are elected. 
    They are not appointed as you gentlemen are. 
    Now, therefore it is -- you can greatly see that there is a greater need for this sort of law in the state system, than that -- than that would be in the federal system. 
    However, all of these goes into the question of intent. 
    I think if that was a clear violation of the law, the fact that this police officer told them to go ahead and do it, I don't think that would make any difference at all. 
    I think it would be something you would have to throw into the scales in weighing this element of intent. 
    I think it's -- I think it's a factor to consider. 
    I said they do but I don't think it's all controlling.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1720.887" stopTime="1754.766">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, you think that the conduct before the Chief of Police told them to disband and move on was in itself sufficient to sustain a conviction even though the Chief of Police had told him after knowing that they intended to do these things that they're kept on one side of the street, to say that that it was alright.
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="1754.766" stopTime="1793.662">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    I think that -- I think they could have been arrested clearly at the old State Capitol for blocking that sidewalk before they ever got to the courthouse. 
    And as the Chief of Police said, the only reason he tolerated it was -- well, of course, I've just read it from the transcript, he was asked to disperse before he ever got two blocks from the courthouse, which he refused do it. 
    And the only reason that this tolerance or acquiescence on the part of public officials was high, it was because they were trying to get out of that situation as easy as possible.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1793.662" stopTime="1875.622">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask Mr. Roy, going back to the appellate that you and I had yesterday, in which as I understood you and perhaps I was wrong. 
    That the -- you would concede that indeed, whatever the circumstances, they'd had the permission of the police to come out with those two blocks, whatever the reason that the police gave us, to the side of the courthouse. 
    Do you -- is it your position that if that is relevant to the breach of peace and obstruction of the sidewalk condition, that it might not be relevant to the offense that we're now talking about, that is obstructing justice of the courthouse, that if it excuse the basis for, or rather in the phase of the consent of the police, there could perhaps not be a conviction on the breach of peace for obstructing the sidewalk but even if that were true, they'd still be properly convicted under this statute because the Chief of Police could not give them a permission in the face of the language of that statute. 
    That his permission would go no farther than that bare on the factual question of their intent to obstruct. 
    Is that what you're saying?
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="1875.622" stopTime="1885.708">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Yes sir. 
    With one modification, the consent would be relevant only with reference to the breach of the peace.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1885.708" stopTime="1886.558">

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    On the fact of -- well, they've ordered to dispense and disperse or not. 
    I don't think the officers could have said, Well, line up on the sidewalk. 
    And then as soon as they got out there, say in effect, well I've got you, and he puts them under arrest because you have locked him out of the order to disperse. 
    But of course, you don't have that situation into others except with reference to the question of intent. 
    And I think those questions rather than bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the violation or non-violation of this statute here that we're discussing here today. 
    I think those issues bearing more on the question of perhaps facts as to be considered in sentencing the man. 
    I think in fact that it should be considered by a sentencing judge other than the relevant avenues I said (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    That's right. 
    I think it (Voice Overlap) if some that wanted to rob a store and the police officer said, Well, go ahead die with me and he got caught, he wouldn't be not guilty because of the fact that the police officer said he could do it but it may be some sort of justification in the sentence involved.

    They came; they move on the other side of the street notified nobody, and the officer came over there and asked them what they were doing and he told them, he said, you stay on this side of the street.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But why would you say the statute was violated? 
    Let's assume that there haven't been any arrest at all that these people -- these people were assembled or just wanted to have a demonstration. 
    Their general intention was to publicize the desegregation of restaurants or other institutions. 
    So they have picked up the courthouse as the place to assemble and they assembled there and singing a few songs on their way. 
    It was just the -- is that kind of a remote intent certainly -- certainly or probably intended to influence the judges and the other people in the courthouse like they did intend to influence the rest of the community. 
    Is that a violation of the statute?
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="3282.521" stopTime="3340.648">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Well, of course, that would be a question of -- of fact to be determined. 
    The intent is a fact although it's very seldom proved as such. 
    As I said from circumstances, that's a question of fact which the Court passes on. 
    In this case, it was a question that it's not only the trial court but the Supreme Court found to be supported by the evidence if there was ample evidence to show that this element of intent was proved. 
    I think that the fact that -- there are large body of people go over near you like the courthouse where there's no facilities there -- no space, no area to hold any such meeting. 
    It is rather significant thing in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3340.648" stopTime="3343.902">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Had there been any writ of habeas corpus for these people?
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="3343.902" stopTime="3361.154">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    The Supreme Court made -- of Louisiana, mentioned that there had been no application for a writ of habeas corpus with reference to these 23 and there had been no showing that they had obtained bond.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3361.154" stopTime="3369.198">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Who makes -- who makes the decision in Baton Rouge as to whether a charge is going to be filed or where do these people are going to be arraigned.
speaker="ralph_l_roy" startTime="3369.198" stopTime="3372.447">
    Mr. Ralph L. Roy 
    Either the District Attorney's office or the grand jury.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3372.447" stopTime="3385.733">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The grand jury. 
    So a judge at this point would have nothing to do with this case. 
    But did the sheriff have something to do with it? 
    He have just arrested --

    Mr. Nils Douglas 
    If this were a case of the evenhanded administration of justice, many of the issues raised here would not be as perplexing as they are. 
    However, our basic position is that the streets and sidewalks are natural places for people to express their views and if they have no less right to express the view of anti-segregation, then they have a right to express the views on anything else. 
    Much has been made of the fact that the activities took on an aspect of picketing. 
    I might suggest that there were other areas of the demonstration which took off the aspect -- a greater aspect of free speech, the pledging allegiance to the flag. 
    This would suggest a support of the government rather than an attempt to destruct. 
    The singing a patriotic songs, likewise, the singing of religious songs would seem to me to suggest that this was to be nonviolent. 
    The fact that the previous date, the police knew, the fact of the matter is and the testimony of Ronnie Moore on behalf of the defense, states that when the students were leaving Southern University, the Negro bus drivers were arrested so that the Negroes would not get to town. 
    The students, when the bus drivers were arrested, got out and walked to four or five miles to town, which is the reason why the demonstration took place around 12 o'clock. 
    This is free speech, nothing more, nothing less what did the picket signs say? 
    The picket signs didn't say Judge Blanche. 
    Judge Blanche might have had a subjective intent or Judge Blanche might have had a subject to feeling that he was intimidated but this is not the test, the test of whether or not there was a danger to the obstruction of justice is an objective test. 
    Individually, Judge Blanche might have been with all due respect, it's a little more timid than the reasonable judge who happens to be in a courthouse before a demonstration in protest of segregation. 
    Not only were there city police present, the men were taken off leave and put on duty. 
    This was supplanted -- this was supplemented by deputy sheriffs, by the state police by afar. 
    The meeting wasn't stopped because the time was up. 
    The mention on the time was just incidental. 
    The testimony of the two chief representatives of the State, the Chief of Police and the criminal sheriff, they were there, they approved, they directed, they saw the signs, they heard the songs, it was all right for Negroes to be down there only because as one of them testified, it was already an accomplished plot. 
    But hadn't been an accomplished plot and hadn't the students walk from Scotlandville, they would have prevented it. 
    The demonstration was alright to testify until Cox said, let's sit in. 
    This is wrong, this is a Negro, this is Baton Rouge, this is assault. 
    We are not to disprove of illegal activities, illegal arrests, illegal laws, illegal feet-dragging, judicial feet-dragging. 
    The sheriff and some of the witnesses testified that there was tenseness in the surroundings immediately before the teargas was thrown. 
    We suggest that tenseness alone is not sufficient to create a clear and present danger. 
    We suggest that these -- all the indicia, all the facts, this demonstration was a peaceful one, there was nothing to indicate that the people were going to storm the jails. 
    With reference to the specific intent in the state's brief on page 19, the state may express mention on the fact that they placed particular emphasis on the size of the group, on the fact that these people said that they were there to protest the illegal arrest as if there was no right to protest illegal arrest, the fact that it was near the courthouse and the fact that there was shouting and yelling. 
    It took these four items to be sufficient facts from which it could infer the specific intent to obstruct justice and to influence the judge. 
    I suggest that this is not sufficient evidence. 
    This is no evidence upon which to impute to a man a crime as serious as obstructing justice and influencing the judge. 
    I think it's entirely illegal unconstitutional and immoral to sentence a man to one year in jail and $5000 because they were shouting and yelling.
