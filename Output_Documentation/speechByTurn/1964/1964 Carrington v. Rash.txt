    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    I'm here representing the petitioner in this case, Sergeant Carrington. 
    We initiated this case by filing a petition for writ of mandamus in the Texas Supreme Court. 
    The petition was denied in a 7-to-2 split decision and then this Court granted our petition for certiorari. 
    The case involves voting rights of servicemen residing in Texas. 
    The Constitution of the State of Texas contains a provision which prevents all servicemen from acquiring a voting residence in Texas so long as they remain in the service. 
    If a serviceman while in the service moves into a new county in Texas even if that new county becomes his bona fide residence, he will never be allowed to vote in that county so long as he remains in the military service.

    And to vote in his (Inaudible)?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="75.683" stopTime="101.056">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    If he is a Texas resident and has in fact changed from his original resident, he cannot vote there. 
    So it really matters not whether he originally resided in Texas or resided outside of Texas. 
    Once he intends to acquire a new home, he loses his right to vote in whatever county he came from.

speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="102.777" stopTime="170.522">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    The provision is Article VI, Section 2, and in it effect -- in effect reads like this, “Any member of the military service may vote only in the county in which he resided at the time of entering the service”. 
    The question of course before the Court is whether or not, this particular provision violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is our contention that it does and the respondent -- that respondent Carr contends that it does not. 
    The facts of the -- this particular case as they relate to Sergeant Carrington are these, he is in the United States Army and entered the service in 1946. 
    At that time, he resided in Jefferson County, Alabama. 
    In 1962, he was stationed at White Sands, New Mexico which is very near El Paso County. 
    In February of 1962, he had the choice of either residing in New Mexico or El Paso County. 
    He and his family chose to reside in El Paso County simply because they like the City of El Paso and wanted to make it their home.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="170.522" stopTime="176.254">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say he had the choice, was that his only choice, those two alternatives? 
    Was that the choice that the army gave him or what was it?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="176.254" stopTime="182.199">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, he had to live somewhere near enough to White Sands that he could work there.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="182.742" stopTime="189.371">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    And as a practical matter, he would be limited to New Mexico or El Paso County.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="189.371" stopTime="193.775">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How far from his -- from White Sands is his present residence?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="193.775" stopTime="197.309">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    I think it's approximately 60 miles.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    So he could commute to his armed work --
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="199.431" stopTime="223.923">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    That's correct. 
    And just like many civilians, he comes home at 4:30 in the evening, takes off his uniform, and can participate in community affairs. 
    There's no question in this case but what he did, become a bona fide resident of El Paso County. 
    He in fact purchased a business, his children attend the public schools and that sort of thing. 
    So it is admit --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="223.923" stopTime="230.107">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes. 
    The brief said he was carrying on a business in White Sands which he has now -- has moved to El Paso. 
    What kind of a business is that?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="230.107" stopTime="294.571">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    It was a half hour recording -- repair business. 
    He purchased the machinery and equipment from I believe Las Cruces, New Mexico and transferred it to El Paso County and he's presently still operating it with a partner, in fact another serviceman. 
    In December of 1963, he paid his poll tax. 
    And then in March of 1964, he contacted me and I wrote a letter to the Republican County Chairman, asking the Chairman if Sergeant Carrington would be allowed to vote in the Republican County primary. 
    And he replied, “Of course no, that he could not because under the Texas Constitution, he may vote only in the county in which he resided at the time of entering the service". 
    Now as a practical matter, he could not vote there. 
    This county was Jefferson County, Alabama. 
    He could not vote there because he had designated El Paso County as his home and in fact, it was his home for all purposes.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes, but --
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="295.109" stopTime="314.285">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    So he could not meet the residence requirements of Jefferson County, Alabama or any other county. 
    So he was left without a place to vote. 
    And he will not be allowed to vote in any local state or national election so long as this law remains on the books and so long as he remains in the military service.

    Prior to that time, members of the military had been absolutely prohibited from voting by a provision which classed him with convicted felons, lunatics, minors, and others who were obviously unqualified to vote. 
    In 1954, they were eliminated from that classification and this particular provision was added.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="347.372" stopTime="351.389">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You made it -- that it -- what other states have similar legislations?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="359.247" stopTime="415.808">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    Your Honor, I have not. 
    I do know that in the case of Mabry against Davis, there was a member of the service who was supposedly qualified to know whether or not other states had similar laws. 
    And it was stipulated that he would testify that Texas was the only state. 
    Now, the respondents have pointed out in their brief that there are -- I think three or four other states that have similar provisions. 
    My research was limited but from what I can tell, the prohibitions that appear on some of the other -- in some of the other states don't have the same effect as this one. 
    The effect of the other provisions is that they state that a member of the military cannot apply a voting residence simply by being stationed there. 
    Of course, we will agree with this more must be shown. 
    The serviceman must show that he is a bona fide resident of the particular county.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="415.808" stopTime="420.473">

    Or for as long as about a year or six months.
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="420.473" stopTime="431.141">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    That's correct. 
    The same requirement that is imposed upon all citizens regardless of occupation, if that is six months or a year, fine.

    Yes, he does. 
    Not under the statute but under the election laws of Texas, he must prove to either the tax collector or to the election judge that sits at the polling place that he is a bona fide resident. 
    And if he falsified his statement, he is subject to felony convictions --

    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    No, it does not. 
    But then of course, many civilians know that they're not permanently residents of a particular county. 
    All he must show is that while he is there, he intends for that to be his home.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="497.676" stopTime="501.297">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    No.

    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    No, he does not but neither though any of the civilian voters. 
    For example, members of college faculties often know that they're going to be located in a particular area for a limited number of years. 
    But if they intend for that county to be their home while they are there, then they would be allowed to vote. 
    And of course our contention is that a man in the service should have the same opportunity to prove his residence as all of the other civilian voters in the county.

    Are you saying in fact this is not a -- I mean, this is an invidious classification against him, is that true?
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="551.478" stopTime="637.599">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    That is correct, Your Honor, that the classification is unreasonable and amounts to discrimination against servicemen. 
    One of the primary contingence of the respondent and the respondent takes the position that the classification is reasonable, and that there are real and substantial differences between servicemen and civilians. 
    Our position is that very definitely there are certain unique characteristics of the military profession. 
    But then their unique characteristics of all professions which distinguish them from all others, we do not feel that the differences are sufficient to restrict the serviceman's voting rights. 
    Now one primary difference which respondent Carr emphasizes in his brief is that members of the military service are very often only temporary residents of a particular county. 
    And of course this is true. 
    Many of them are there for a limited number of years. 
    But we do not feel that this alone is a sufficient difference from other citizens to discriminate only against the servicemen. 
    As I mentioned, members of college faculties were there temporarily, also, employees of large national corporations, perhaps insurance executives might be located in a particular area for a limited number of years.

    Some of them are very active in community and civil affairs. 
    Some of them will swear that if they are transferred somewhere else, they would leave their family there and that they would return as soon as possible and that they in fact intend to retire there.

    If -- for the military man who goes into service in Texas, and he serves there and retains his home in the county where he entered the service.

    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    No Your Honor, I would think not primarily for this reason. 
    There seems to me to be a very large distinction when you're dealing with voting rights in one case where you're actually extending the privilege further and in other case like ours, you're denying them. 
    It would seem to me that it would be difficult to complain if you were in effect by legislation extending suffrage rights but there seems to be a very big difference when you're in fact restricting them or denying them as they are in this case. 
    In summary, let me point this out. 
    The Court well knows that in this country, voting rights are basic and essential. 
    The Court has recently so stated in the apportionment cases. 
    The President of the United States in his State of the Union Message said, “I propose we eliminate all remaining obstacles to the right to vote”. 
    I mentioned this simply to show that we're living in a time when voting rights are being expanded and not restricted. 
    And because this case involves voting rights, it is our position that the respondents must show that some overwhelming public interest will be served by this restriction. 
    We feel that the respondents must show that this particular restriction promotes the public welfare to some extent. 
    And we submit to the Court that the State of Texas has not and cannot present any valid reason for restricting the serviceman's right to vote. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Hawthorne Phillips 
    Petitioner in this case is a member of the armed services and contends that Article VI, Section 2 of the Texas Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We don't agree with this contention. 
    I wish to discuss three basic questions that have arisen in this case. 
    First, can a state pass any laws discriminating against the particular class of individuals which I think is fairly elementary, this Court has decided that issue so many times. 
    Second, if the state can pass discriminatory laws where there are any constitutional innovations that would restrict the states on the term -- on determining the qualifications and rules for voting. 
    And third, there's the Constitution of Texas, Article VI, Section 2 arbitrarily and invidiously discriminate against members of the Armed Forces by providing that they may vote only in the county in which they resided at the time of their entry into the military service. 
    Or if you state it another way, as a prohibition of the members of the military service from acquiring residence for voting in Texas during the period of their service, constitute arbitrary and invidious discrimination. 
    Now this case on the question of the right of this Court on -- question of the right of a state to discriminate has discussed that many times. 
    I think the last time in the case of McLaughlin versus State of Florida in which you've listed quite a number of cases giving rights of discrimination in particular instance. 
    And in the second question presented, this Court also on many occasions has held that the United States Constitution makes voter's qualifications rest on state laws even in federal elections. 
    Speaking of course Article I, Section 2 of the election of members of Congress, the Seventeenth Amendment in which the election of Senators, the elector's qualifications are based on the qualifications of the electorates to the most numerous House of the State Legislature. 
    Now, the right of determination of qualifications is limited according to other decisions of this Court. 
    And I would say now by the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and by the Equal Protection Clause insofar as they might -- there might be arbitrary and invidious discrimination. 
    The petitioner did discuss in his brief some of the language used by this Court in the -- both the legislative and congressional redistricting cases. 
    I won't go into detail on those but those cases dealt with discrimination in the weighing or denying of the equal weight of the vote of qualified voters within the state. 
    Those who were determined to qualify by state law. 
    And this of course, I wish to point out is a different situation and that exist -- that existed there. 
    Now I will agree with the petitioner in this case that generally speaking this Court has held in its past decisions that the interest of the public as distinguished from those of a class requires interference and that the means adopted are reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive on the individual. 
    That was held by this Court in the case of Lawton versus Steele, 152 U.S. 137. 
    Now, I also wish to point out to the Court that it has been held in the past that when a provision or a law is attacked, that if there any state of facts that would sustain it, then there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and the person assailing that classification has the burden of showing that the Legislation Act -- legislative action is arbitrary. 
    Again, this Court held that the determination of the legislature will not be questioned if grounds may reasonably be conceived to justify. 
    That was held in one case, Metropolitan Casualty Company of New York versus Brownell in 295 U.S. 580. 
    And we can name a number of them on down until recent times in which this Court has held that it's only invidious and arbitrary discrimination with which we're interested in. 
    Alright now, historically, we might go back a little. 
    States have classified and prohibited certain classes of people from voting. 
    And as has been mentioned, among these people in these classes, and these are each classes are miners, lunatics, women, Indians, poppers, felons, colored people, people not owning property, and members of the military. 
    Now certainly, we have had some constitutional amendments that have eliminated some of these discriminations. 
    To go back to the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed and shortly thereafter, this Court decided the case of Miner versus Happersett in -- reported in 21 Wall. 178. 
    In that case, this Court held that Fourteenth Amendment did not grant citizenship to anyone, that the women already were citizens of this country. 
    That if the right of suffrage was a necessary privilege of citizenship then the Constitution of Missouri which denied the women the right to vote would violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    However, this was not the case as it was held that the power of the state was supreme to set out the qualifications even in national elections. 
    It was further stated that Article IV, Section 2 didn't confer the right to vote. 
    And if suffrage was necessary like in the incident of national citizenship, then the citizens of each state would be entitled to vote in every other state where they might happen to be just as if they were citizen of that state. 
    Again, just a few years later in 1876, in U.S. versus Cruikshank, the Court held that it appears that the right of suffrage is not a necessary attribute of national citizenship but that exemption from discrimination and the exercise of that right on account of race is the right to vote in the state comes from the state. 
    But the right of the exemption from the prohibited discrimination comes from the United States, the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    The first has not been granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States but the last one has. 
    Now we feel that these cases are rather significant because as this Court held in the case of U.S. versus Wong Kim Ark in 169 U.S. 649. 
    The interpretations by authorities in the field at the relative time that an Act or Amendment was passed should be given even more weight than the debates in the Congress in the legislative history. 
    Another contemporary author of that particular time had commented on the Fourteenth Amendment which the Honorable George W. McCrary, Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of the Eighth Circuit and formerly he was Chairman of the Committee on Elections of the House of Representatives. 
    He stated in a work that he had published, “A Treatise on the American Law of Elections” which was published in 1875 and again revised in 1880, that the right of suffrage is not a natural right nor is it an absolute and unqualified right. 
    It is a right derived in this country from the constitution and statutes. 
    It is regulated by the states in their power to fix the qualifications of voters as limited only by the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment to the constitution which forbids any discrimination on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 
    And then again, in 1887, property plane of the Washington Bar, compared the treatise on the law of elections to public offices in which he commented that accordingly, the right of suffrage is in fact enjoined in the United States as in England only by a minority of members of the state. 
    It is in practice held -- withheld from women and in theory, if not in practice, from miners, idiots, lunatics, and criminals which five classes together constitute a majority of the citizens of the United States. 
    These authorities all held in effect that state suffrage laws could be discriminatory. 
    And except for the Fifteenth Amendment, there was no constitutional inhibition. 
    That was felt necessary that the constitution be amended to prevent discriminate -- discriminatory classifications because of race, trade or color as set out -- or race or previous condition of servitude as set out in the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    And again in the Nineteenth Amendment, we had the elimination of women from the discrimination. 
    Now -- or the states forbidden to place military personnel in a separate and distinct class when they find a valid reason to do so.

    Alright sir, I'll try to do so. 
    Now going back of course, I think that this Court is aware and will take notice of the fact that there have been a number of discriminatory laws passed in favor of people in military service. 
    I believe, Mr. Justice Goldberg, mentioned some of those earlier. 
    You have laws giving military the right to get a pension. 
    You have the -- of discrimination in civil -- in jobs in civil service regulations, and loan preferences, and for example, I think you might also state that in most instances jury service is another area where military men are not required to serve.

speaker="hawthorne_phillips" startTime="1782.868" stopTime="1952.726">
    Mr. Hawthorne Phillips 
    Mr. Justice White, I'm not contending if that's a reason, just an example to show discrimination does exist in other fields in favor of the military as they are now claiming there is some discrimination against them in this area. 
    I think you'll find that historically and this question was asked if there were other states that prohibited or had equal provisions regarding the voting privileges of the military. 
    And Mrs. Wall will discuss that in more detail but I might point out that historically, an early Pennsylvanian case of Chase versus Miller held that the right of a soldier to vote is confined to the election district where he resided at the time he entered the military service, same situation we have here. 
    Again, it was stated in paragraph 71, page 50 of planes treatise on the law of elections, that enlistment in service on the army of the United States do not disqualify an elector from voting at the place of his legal residence but he cannot by service of a military post acquire the residence prescribed by law as one of the qualifications of an elector. 
    Also cited in the cases of contested elections in Congress by Clark and Hall as the case of (Inaudible) Richard versus Wayne at page 512 which states that a requirement that soldiers must remain a year after discharge in an area if they wish to vote, if the voting requirement is a one year residence. 
    And it doesn't make any difference how long they might have been stationed there. 
    That they cannot begin to acquire residence for voting purposes until they have been there a year after discharge. 
    Now those are a few examples of cases where military classification has existed. 
    I think this Court will concede that this Government, the people of the United States and of all of the states have most jealously guarded against the military taking over the civilly -- the civil government in the country. 
    As I understand it, the Constitution of 49 of our states now has some provision in that regard, that the military will be subordinate to the civilian. 
    Then we might say, is this discrimination invidious? 
    We would say that it was and I think it was pointed out a little earlier in one of the questions that Texas, I believe Mr. Justice Black asked if this one, the modification of our constitution. 
    It certainly is a modification.

    Mr. Hawthorne Phillips 
    It is because Texas did not allow the military to vote at all. 
    And there was historically a good reason for it. 
    And shortly after Texas won their independence, the army tried to take over the Government and they were seeking to imprison President Barnett and later when Sam Houston became president, he was able to disperse the army. 
    Now that has been not fair in the background and in the reasoning for the -- in the history of this particular provision in the constitution. 
    In 1954, the people by a vote, the constitution is amended in Texas by first the legislature passing the matter and then it's being given to the people to vote on. 
    This amendment was adopted allowing some latitude there. 
    And certainly I don't know the reasoning, Mr. Justice Goldberg, and I can't state -- put any valid reason why as so not including the wives other than the fact maybe they thought they would not be under direct military control. 
    I can't honestly answer if I know that if any consideration was actually given to the fact that the wives were not prohibited by this amendment.

    And some of the theories that were related or could be related, I think we've had examples of military indoctrinating soldiers on a particular theory of military commander.

    If the military commander is in disagreement with the local government, he could suggest that his men are domicile to Texas. 
    He could suggest that they might want to get rid of the local government. 
    I'm talking about possibilities now. 
    And that if that suggestion is conceived as an order by those men, certainly -- and enough of them do change their domicile or go down and vote, and have been indoctrinated in the manner of thinking of the military commander. 
    Now it's true that the military commander might be disciplined but the election would be over, the vote would be cast. 
    The results of the election would be excited regardless of what later happened to the military commander. 
    Although we did on occasion have military commanders, I know in the past, disciplined for improper indoctrination of their troops. 
    That was the danger that the legislature and the people of Texas felt that actually existed in adopting this and relaxing the prohibition against military voting at all.

    I don't know if that's true in all states, sir, but I'm sure that in every state, gives the military man the right to vote absentee. 
    I don't know that any state that does not have absentee voting rights and does so permit. 
    Certainly, Texas does. 
    We have equally as many men in service from Texas as we have stationed in the service in Texas. 
    Those people are voting absentee if they wished, if they too have not changed their residence to another state.

    Sergeant Carrington came to Texas at the time these laws were already in existence. 
    This was not something that was passed after he got there. 
    It was an existing law, an existing condition. 
    He came in to Texas, decided to live there, knowing that this condition did exist. 
    Now why he chose El Paso, it -- if -- it was because Texas doesn't have an income tax and New Mexico does. 
    If you reside in New Mexico or whether the facilities of the commissary and the post exchange existed, I don't know. 
    He did come. 
    He did come with the law of being as it was in a set of facts and conditions that he found and he -- now he is asking to change those already existing facts and conditions.

   Argument of Mary K. Wall
speaker="mary_k_wall" startTime="2838.940" stopTime="3033.339">
    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    May it please the Court. 
    I want to discuss first the question which Mr. Justice White raised from the bench a few moments ago when petitioner was presenting his argument as to whether the Texas law accords a different treatment to members of the military who entered service as residence of the State of Texas and those who entered as residence of some other state. 
    Now there has been some other passing mentioned of that in subsequent statements of counsel but I want to be sure that this is clearly understood because it was in petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari. 
    There was some confusion in his presentation I believe of whether that was an issue and also in the District Court's opinion in the case of Mabry versus Davis which I -- all of the members of the Court may now be aware of is a case of very similar nature to this one involving essentially the same matters and it is now pending on a -- in a jurisdictional statement for appeal in that case has been filed by the Attorney General. 
    The District Court for the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas has held that the provision in the Texas law is unconstitutional. 
    The District Court in its opinion, clearly assumed both in its opinion and in its judgment assumed that the Texas law operates differently upon people who enter a service as a resident of some other state and those who enter as residents of the State of Texas. 
    Now the provision in the Texas constitution is that a person in military service may vote only in the county in which he resided so long had -- as he continues to be a member of the Armed Forces. 
    Now this operates exactly in the same manner upon a person who entered as a resident of the State of Texas and person who entered service as a resident of some other state. 
    If after entering service, that person changes his legal residence to some place other than the place where he had his legal residence at the time he entered service. 
    The effect is that so long as that person is a resident of the State of Texas, he cannot vote because he may vote only in the county where he resided at the time he entered service. 
    If the person entered service as a resident of Travis County and is now stationed in El Paso County and has decided that he is going to claim legal residence in El Paso County, he may not vote in Texas at all. 
    If a per -- if -- that is exactly the same effect that it has on the person who entered as a resident of some other state and is now claiming to be a legal resident of the State of Texas.

    In every state in the union including Texas, including Alabama, in fact every state in the union without qualification, without exception. 
    A person in military service is permitted to retain his legal residence in the state and in the place where he lived when he entered service as long as he continues in service regardless of the length of absence whether -- if Sergeant Carrington had never set forth in Alabama once after he entered service, he still could have continued to claim that his -- as his place of legal residence as long as he was in service.

    Now, you say that I understand what you said about there being no discrimination among military people as far as the Texas Constitution is concerned. 
    My point was that the reason you say that you won't let this particular military man vote and others like him, is that maybe this military man doesn't have the interest, interest enough in the local government to justify -- of permitting him to vote because he may be moving on. 
    Well this is -- do you say it follows from the fact that he's a military man but you do let other military men with the same kind of problem about him to vote --

    The people who entered Texas, who entered the service in Texas and are allowed to go to Texas, are in the military and they aren't even in Texas and may never be there again. 
    And you permit them to vote all the time. 
    And yet the person who had -- like this gentleman who has decided to live in Texas, he's there on the spot, he has a home there, he has his family, he's not off in Hawaii or Alaska, or some place, he may never return. 
    I'm just suggesting that the reason you have for discriminating between one military man and another maybe -- may bear some examination, that's all.
speaker="mary_k_wall" startTime="3265.600" stopTime="3289.087">
    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    We don't allow the person who entered service as a resident of Texas to vote at the place he is stationed based up -- on a residence acquired during military service. 
    And that is the point of distinction. 
    He votes -- that home where he grew up, if he votes at all in Texas, he votes back where he lived before he entered service.

    This sergeant can't vote and the other fellow can.

    Let's just -- everybody accepts the fact here that this sergeant is living in El Paso and he's going to live there. 
    He wants to make it his home, that's the record. 
    That's the fact for itself. 
    So here are two residents of El Paso, the City of El Paso. 
    One entered the service from -- when he was in Alabama. 
    The other entered the service when he was in El Paso and they both work at White Sands, both ride together up work everyday. 
    Both go to the polling place, one can vote, one can't.

    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, its getting at the very same -- the person, the person who lived there when he entered service has now -- or let me take the other text, the person who acquires -- who claims to establish residence during military service. 
    Now, we -- let me set out some statistics first. 
    A person, the average length of tenure at one particular duty station varies from -- a permanent duty station varies from average of two to four years. 
    The person is there for that length of time and then he is moved somewhere else. 
    He -- our contention is that during -- that because of the temporary nature of his sojourn in the place where he is stationed, he cannot have the same opportunity to acquire an interest in community affairs to become assimilated into the community actually to learn the needs and necessities of the community to become familiar with the local government in the manner that a person should be able to let -- in the manner that a person should in order to be able to vote there that because of the nature of his military service which may take him away from there at any moment. 
    And at the most, is likely to keep him there only for a limited time that he does not become in fact a member of the community to entitle him to vote there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3473.779" stopTime="3526.444">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, let's add a third man to this group. 
    There's another fellow who entered this service from El Paso. 
    The only thing is, he moved to Albuquerque. 
    He was first shifted up to to Albuquerque and then he was shifted to the White Sands, could he retain his -- his family is in Albuquerque and he drives down to White Sands everyday from Albuquerque. 
    And he says, “I don't have -- I don't know why you want to live in El Paso. 
    I'm never going back to El Paso. 
    I -- as far as I know, I'm going to live in Albuquerque.” 
    But he works at the same des -- the White Sands with these other two fellows who live in El Paso and two of them can go down to El Paso and vote and this other one can't, this argue -- in his case can't. 
    And this fellow has no more interest in El Paso and -- well, he certainly hasn't got the interest that the sergeant does, he's going to live there.
speaker="mary_k_wall" startTime="3526.444" stopTime="3685.951">
    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    Now I -- it -- I think that (Inaudible) -- you -- that question would be getting to the proposition that a person must be -- although he is admittedly a permanent resident of the place that he must be shown to have some kind of overwhelming interest in the community before he is going to be entitled to vote. 
    Now if that -- if -- I think that that proposition gets somewhat beyond our -- the question in this present case. 
    Now our contention is that the people in military service because of the nature of their service, the fact that they are at the most temporary residents at the place where they are stationed, that as a class, that is a characteristic that differentiates them from any other class of citizens -- of resident and for that reason, that they are entit -- that the state may treat them separately as a class subject to this common characteristic. 
    Now the fact that there may be individual members of the class that don't fit the pattern, as Sergeant Carrington for example, it is our contention that he doesn't fit the pattern of the typical man in military service. 
    And incidentally, there's -- there are some statistics, I believe that Mr. Justice Brennan raised the question that, “Would there only be a small number of people who would want to claim residence in the State of Texas?” 
    Now there are 66%. 
    The statistics we have on that is that 66% of the people in the Fourth Army Command which embraces five states including State of Texas are career servicemen. 
    We don't have any statistics on the other three services but the conjecture seems to be supportable that the percentage of career of servicemen in the other services would run as high or higher. 
    Now those 66% are the people who have pulled up roots back where they grew up, where they entered service, where they would be entitled to claim residence if they wanted to. 
    They are the people who are likely to want to claim a residence wherever they happened to be stationed. 
    There are --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3685.951" stopTime="3698.173">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) a little inconsistency? 
    I gather that you're saying being career service people or people with long tenure, isn't that inconsistent with your other argument that tenure is usually not more than two years. 
    They don't have time enough to get used to --
speaker="mary_k_wall" startTime="3698.173" stopTime="3751.089">
    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    No, I'm -- I am speaking of the length of time spent in military service and not that spent at a particular duty station. 
    Now, I said that the length of -- that a person remained at a particular duty station is of limited duration, two to four years. 
    Now -- but the career person will be in service for a long time. 
    He has no particular reason to want to continue to claim residence at the place where he entered service. 
    Now, the other 33% are a lesser percent for some branches of the service, yes. 
    They're in the service because they have to be there, they have to fulfill a certain compulsory requirement, all they're thinking that is getting out and going back home, they aren't the ones who are going to want this (Voice Overlap) --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that 66% who are in -- who in for a -- or in for a long time have no reason to continue to claim residence where they entered the service that nevertheless doesn't mean that they have no interest in maintaining residence somewhere, almost all of them before very long are going to want to plan for the future upon retirement. 
    And they do pick out localities to live, and just like this sergeant. 
    Because it's your -- your position of course does mean that -- if the sergeant is 21 years old or 22 years old, and he's going to stay in until the time of retirement. 
    He's permanently disenfranchised.

    And as a matter of fact, we were -- I don't believe that that should tax our credulity because we hear talk of the possibility of ending the draft. 
    In fact there is a study going on right now as to whether it is feasible to end the draft. 
    And that would be on the -- in the belief that there would be enough people voluntarily entering service and most of them would be entering with the purpose of making it a career. 
    Now I -- the -- coming back though to -- to make a point briefly, it is our contention that a person so long as he is in military service and subject to being transferred at any time by a military order which he cannot resist, that he at the most is a mere soldier in the place where he is living, where he is stationed. 
    Now it is our contention that a state could withhold from him the privilege of acquiring residence for any purpose. 
    Now the law of Texas permits a serviceman to acquire residence for all purposes except voting. 
    It merely says to him -- it says, “Yes, we recognize you as a resident for all other purposes but we are not going to allow you to vote if you do establish your resident during military service.” 
    Now it is our contention that he could -- that the privilege of establishing residence for any purpose could be withheld from a person in military service so long as he continues in service because he is in fact merely temporarily within the state. 
    It's not within his choice to remain no matter how much he might wish to remain. 
    It is not his choice.

    And I know just from the correspondence that crosses my desk in the Attorney General's Office that that is a very strong inducement to people in military service to want to claim residence in the State of Texas while they are stationed there and after they have been transferred somewhere else under this privilege that the Texas law gives them once having established residence that they can continue to maintain residence, and that would apply to the person in military service having residence established while in service although he couldn't vote. 
    He could continue to maintain his legal residence and that is a very strong inducement to people in military service to want to establish residence in the State of Texas.

    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    Now, Your Honor, we are not. 
    The fact of residence has been admitted, not disputed whether Sergeant Carrington actually felt there was no proof. 
    The allegations were accepted because the State of Texas had no reason to want to say to Sergeant Carrington, “You must prove this. 
    We doubt your word.” 
    This is what we frankly would term a test case. 
    Undoubtedly --

speaker="mary_k_wall" startTime="4405.961" stopTime="4518.589">
    Ms. Mary K. Wall 
    There were allegations that were not disputed. 
    Now every state in the United States requires a certain length of residence before a person may vote. 
    The length of residence in some states, in most states is one year. 
    In some states it is two years. 
    Now those requirements have been held to be constitutional that at least -- except, I believe there has not been an adjudication as to those requirements with respect to voting for in the presidential election and there is a case now before the Court in which that questions is being presented. 
    Now the theory on which those states -- the theory on which states may withhold for a time the privilege of voting is because the person until he has been in the state at certain length of time has not become assimilated into the community. 
    The exactly we say that the same reasoning supports -- would support withholding the privilege of voting from persons in military service because no matter -- even though they have been within the state for that length of time and for some period in excess of that, that because they are subject to being transferred to other places without any volition on their part to remain that they never in fact become members of the community while they are in the military service.

    And I'm sorry that I can't devote more time to it in the oral argument. 
    I want to emphasize that petitioner is not typical of persons in military service generally. 
    We contend that even as to petitioner, there is a reasonable basis for withholding voting privileges from him. 
    But as to the class as a whole, we say that petitioner is not typical and the fact that a few inequalities may exist because of a classification which basically is sound does not render it invalid as to the isolated examples of who are not typical of the general --

   Rebuttal of Wayne Windle
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="4815.987" stopTime="4884.586">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    May it please the Court. 
    I will try to make my remarks as brief as possible. 
    In my opening statement, I did mention that I felt that the State of Texas must show that some public interest would be served by this provision. 
    Let me just very briefly examine some of the reasons that respondent Carr says justifies this particular voting restriction. 
    I think the main contention is that if the servicemen were allowed to vote, they might constitute a majority in some particular county. 
    And then they would exercise complete dominion and control over the local politics. 
    First of all, let me say that I agree with the three judges in the Mabry case. 
    I don't believe there is such an area where the balance of power would be altered by abolishing this provision. 
    But even if there was an area where the servicemen would be a majority and would exercise a complete control over the local politics, they have a right to do so. 
    If the majority happened to be members of labor unions in a particular county, they can control the politics.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And besides, this isn't one of those areas.
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="4887.317" stopTime="4889.724">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    That's correct. 
    I think there are no areas --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4889.724" stopTime="4892.543">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but (Inaudible) -- El Paso isn't one of those areas.
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="4892.543" stopTime="4944.599">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    No sir, it surely is not. 
    Another argument advanced by the respondent Carr is that a commanding officer might control the politics himself through pressure and persuasion on his men. 
    Well first of all, the federal law prohibits any military officer from influencing votes of the men under his command. 
    Secondly, we do have secret elections in Texas. 
    We vote by secret ballot and any pressure or persuasion that the commanding officer might put on one of his men, could not be so coercive if that man would be prevented from voting his own convictions. 
    But once he entered the voting booth or began marking his secret ballot. 
    So we do not believe that here is any threat that a commanding officer himself could control the elections. 
    So we feel that those arguments (Voice Overlap)
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4944.599" stopTime="4965.069">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And what about this -- what about this situation. 
    Say that there is a -- say that down at Colorado Springs, Colorado there is a camp of 12,000 military men and they're all -- are stationed there for four years and they all qualified to vote. 
    They all say we're going to -- just --
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="4965.069" stopTime="4968.116">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    (Inaudible) that was one of the things mentioned in there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4968.116" stopTime="4983.275">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's right. 
    And -- then four years later -- and they also vote of many improvements on roads and things like that, after the camp things like that and then four years later, the camp is closed. 
    They all departed.
speaker="wayne_windle" startTime="4983.275" stopTime="5137.377">
    Mr. Wayne Windle 
    If those men were qualified voters while they were there, they have the right to do that. 
    If they were not, of course they should not be allowed to vote. 
    But the same thing can happen of course in a civilian community. 
    One of the arguments asserted is that servicemen might like a proper concern for the best interest of the community. 
    Well, of course this can be set of any group. 
    The problem is what group of people can say that another group lacks the proper concern for the best interest of the community. 
    The majority of the qualified voters are the ones that should determine what is in the best interest of the community. 
    One argument presented was that the petitioner is not typical, that person is in the military service. 
    We say that if given the opportunity, there are other servicemen like petitioner who can prove that they're bona fide residents. 
    Another argument was that the classification is not invalid because it results in some inequities. 
    In this connection, respondent, Carr mentioned that the wife can vote whereas the serviceman cannot. 
    And he mentioned that this was possibly an over cite. 
    And I got the distinct idea that if the state so decided they could also restrict her right to vote. 
    And let me submit this to the Court, which group will be next if this voting provision is allowed to stand for the reasons asserted by the respondent? 
    Which group will the State of Texas or some other state find where the members -- where some of the members aren't bona fide residents? 
    Which group would Texas or some other state find where the members might be influenced by somebody in a position of authority or where there are cohesion among members of the group, or where the group, if allowed to vote, might constitute a majority. 
    And of course -- then there are other reasons. 
    We submit to the Court if this particular provision for voting restriction is allowed to stand for the reasons asserted by respondent Carr, then there can be and would probably be other denials of the right to vote. 
    Therefore we request the Court to declare this one unconstitutional. 
    Thank you.
