speaker="euel_a_screws_jr" startTime="31.850" stopTime="244.627">
    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    On August of 24th 1958, approximately 15 months after the illegal seizure, searches and seizure in the Mapp versus Ohio, petitioner was subjected to a series of illegal searches and seizures involving his home, his person and his place of business. 
    I believe that the State of Louisiana admits that these seizures were unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. 
    Three weeks after these searches, he was charged with the crime which was wholly unrelated to the original search. 
    He was convicted of this crime of burglary and sentenced to nine years in prison. 
    After his, the case of Mapp versus Ohio, the petitioner began a series of pro se habeas corpus petitions which finally ended in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit below. 
    I believe that the State of Louisiana has conceded that he has exhausted his advantages by the opinion below and the issue presented in the opinion below was whether or not the rule of Mapp versus Ohio should be applied retroactively to effect prisoners whose convictions became final prior to the date of Mapp versus Ohio. 
    Judge Reeves speaking for divided circuit hailed that Mapp would be applied prospectively and that the right not to be convicted on unconstitutionally seized evidence would not be accorded to Victor Linkletter because his conviction became final prior to the date of this Court's decision in Mapp. 
    The opinion below was based perhaps on three premises. 
    First that the purpose of the Mapp decision is deterrence and deterrence of illegal police action and this purpose can only be served or is mostly served by a prospective application of Mapp. 
    The second premises of the Fifth Circuit's decision was that orderly judicial administration requires a prospective as opposed to retrospective application. 
    And the third premise is that perhaps Mr. Linkletter and other prisoners who have been convicted on illegal seized evidence are in fact guilty and that the issue of fairness of the trial, that is the issue of guilt or innocence, his innocence is not before the Court and if this rule or constitutional right announced in Mapp should be given some sort of special treatment. 
    Now, we think that the opinion below is wrong on all three of these basic premises. 
    The circuits as this Court knows are split now 4 to 2, 4 holding that Mapp versus Ohio should be fully retroactive, I mean sorry, prospective application and two holding that the Mapp rule should be given retrospective application to all prisoners. 
    We think that --

    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    Yes sir that's right, procuring the (Inaudible). 
    We think that the fundamental personal right not to be convicted on unconstitutionally seized evidence is the rule of Mapp. 
    By emphasizing the purpose of deterrence, the Fifth Circuit has obliterated the rule itself. 
    Now, we concede that deterrence is perhaps a purpose or is a purpose. 
    This Court in Mapp state that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter or to compel respect for the constitutional guarantee in the only effective available way by removing the (Inaudible) to disregard it as a quote from the Elkins decision, but this is not the sole and exclusive purpose of Mapp. 
    We submit that the rule of Mapp or the purposes of Mapp, other purposes are that this right not to be unconstitutionally convicted or convicted on unconstitutional evidence is reserved to all persons. 
    This Court stated that it is reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee and that this right should be --

    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    The seizures and searches in the Mapp case and in the Linkletter case were items which were fully -- the seizures were plenary. 
    Evidence was seized which was totally unrelated to the original search. 
    If there had been a constitutional seizure there would not have been a prosecution. 
    This right goes to the basis of the whole case.

    It was contended to be stolen, the petitioner has never admitted it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="452.996" stopTime="460.353">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No I am not asking to admit anything, but that was -- the stuff that was admitted was allegedly stolen property?
speaker="euel_a_screws_jr" startTime="460.353" stopTime="523.736">
    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    Some of it was, some of it was his personal papers, some notes, key rings, shoes, (Inaudible) torch, various, various items. 
    He was arrested originally for an alleged burglary occurring on one street. 
    He was charged with that crime. 
    The crime was dismissed, the charges were dismissed. 
    He was later, three weeks later charged with another wholly unrelated crime based on evidence seized and we think that this goes beyond the fundamental fairness of the trial. 
    This is something more base (Inaudible). 
    The same is true in Ms. Mapp. 
    She was -- had been searched by -- for some policy paper maybe and they found some lewd literature. 
    It was an instantly illegal search and she was convicted of possession of lewd literature. 
    So the -- I think that I maybe not evading the question, but to me it seems like that the guilt or innocence argument is even stronger in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.736" stopTime="527.647">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well of course this court doesn't sit here to determine guilt or innocence?
speaker="euel_a_screws_jr" startTime="527.647" stopTime="674.981">
    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    But the fact of guilt or innocence I think should not enter into the decision of retrospective versus prospective application. 
    To quote other purposes of Mapp was that saying was that this right is reserved to all persons having as a specific guarantee. 
    The Court stated that this right if not – this Court would not allow this right to stand in marked contrast to other rights, declared as basic to a free society. 
    And I think that perspective limitation would make this right stand in Mapp contrast. 
    It would isolated from the rights set forth in Gideon decision, the Griffin and Jackson versus Denno. 
    These decisions have been applied retroactive by this Court. 
    We think that perspective limitation of Mapp would obliterate the rule of the right of Mapp by removing from Victor Linkletter this right. 
    It will make it stand in marked contrast. 
    I think we mentioned that -- I had mentioned in the brief the utility or perhaps irony of arguing what this Court meant in Mapp versus Ohio, what we think that perhaps the intent of retroactive application was set forth in footnote nine of the Mapp decision where this Court stated that there are some who say, as did Justice Cardozo, the undoubted constitution exclusionary doctrine, that criminals to go free because the constable has blundered. 
    In some cases, this will undoubtedly be the result. 
    Footnote nine stating that, “We note, moreover, that the class of state convictions possibly affected by this decision is of relatively narrow compass when compared with Burns versus Ohio, Griffin versus Illinois, and Herman versus Claudy. 
    We think the Court had in mind in this footnote nine, the fact that Mapp would be given retroactive application.

    And that the person must be presently detained and that the present detention must be judged on the present constitutional principles and I think it is very sound and I would like to call the Court's attention to it.

    This article should come out, the Law Review should come out in about three weeks. 
    And he treats the whole scope of retroactive versus prospective application in civil cases, in tort contract and criminal cases. 
    And he comes to the same conclusion that in this, in Mapp versus Ohio, the fact is the relevant present day fact is command retroactive application, that the quality of treatment of prisoners far overrides any reliance that the State of Louisiana may have placed on Wolf and this is a very excellent article and I hope --

    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    I have some doubt whether he could. 
    The Fifth Circuit put a great deal of emphasis on the disruption at the orderly administration of justice. 
    Mr. Uviller and his amicus brief dwells at length on the wholesale release of all these prisoners. 
    The first of countless past cases and opening a thousands of past cases for serving under this new right or scrutiny under this new right, we think this is purely speculative. 
    This Court has passed on this opening of prison gate argument in the Gideon case and I think again it answered it in Mapp. 
    I would like to point out to the Court that there have only been 23 reported decisions in three-and-a-half years since Mapp. 
    I don't know whether this is indicative of the wholesale release of the number, but I doubt that many prisoners are waiting filing their Habeas Corpus petitions on this Court to rule in Linkletter. 
    We think that the orderly administration of justice in fact it must yield to the important fact of judicial integrity as advanced by this Court in Mapp in that the equality of treatment of prisoners is -- cannot better serve for -- judicial integrity cannot be better served than the equality of this.

    He has some factors that interrelate with Mapp. 
    The Louisiana Supreme Court had been a little more tardy in its judicial business --

    Mr. Teddy W. Airhart, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The sole issue before this Court is whether or not a trial which has been final after and later a decision rendered, reversing a prior case upon which was the basis of the proceedings in the state court whether or not that later decision is to be applied retroactively, namely the Mapp case. 
    The Lower Court held -- the Fifth Circuit held that the Mapp case is to be applied only prospectively. 
    The Court there set forth a rule which is respectfully urged by the State of Louisiana to this Court and that is when determining whether or not a new rule of law which previously overruled a decision on the same point, then we would look to three points in order to determine whether or not the new rule would be retroactive or be given retroactive effect. 
    The first being to attempt to identify the purpose for the new rule. 
    The second is to determine the balance of the purpose and to be sure -- to be served by the new rule and to decide whether or not this purpose would be promoted. 
    Prior to the Mapp decision this Court recognized the right to be free from illegal search and seizure. 
    In the Wolf case this was so held, but at that time, the evidence that was to be introduced by the -- in the State Court proceedings, if obtained illegally, would not be excluded. 
    The Mapp case now recognizes the same rule that was set forth in Weeks which is applicable to the Federal Court in that evidence which is illegally obtained would be excluded in state court proceedings. 
    The position was set forth by the state in its brief that the purpose for the Mapp decision is to give purpose to the right to be free from an illegal search and seizure. 
    This right prior to Mapp was to be secured in other type of proceeding. 
    I assume at the time that civil proceedings could be brought against the officers who then made an illegal search and seizure, but at the time of the Mapp decision, this Court having recognized that right gave impetus to that right of freedom from an illegal search and seizure by barring the use of this evidence in the state court. 
    The primary contention or one of the primary contentions of the petitioner is that his act or his right to be secure from unlawful search and seizure occurred at a time which was after the illegal search in Mapp.

    Mr. Teddy W. Airhart, Jr. 
    Yes sir, those are correct. 
    I think that it is well to define what the is the state's position on retro-activity. 
    The question would have to be determined in order to say whether or not this Court is applying it retroactively. 
    Any case that is final as of the date that the Mapp case was decided by this Honorable Court, would be one which we would have to say would be retroactive if so applied. 
    This is a case which is being attacked, a final Court decision which was valid at the time of the trail is being attacked collaterally by writ of habeas corpus. 
    In as much as the case was totally finalized at the time that Mapp decision was offered by this Court or held by this Court, Linkletter had completely adjudicated his question. 
    Now the question is what was the purpose for Mapp. 
    Mapp is to be given prospective application in order that there will be a deterrent against state offices from violating constitutional rights. 
    The purpose for this deterrent would be in no way served by holding Mapp retroactive. 
    I am quite sure that all of the courts, I know that the State of Louisiana is following Mapp and therefore the practice which the Court sought to bring to a conclusion or to finalize was in its decision format to hold that there is a deterrent to further stop the officers from this unlawful search and seizure. 
    If there are no questions, I have relinquished some time to the amicus curiae which I will now turn over to him.

speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="2107.660" stopTime="2329.309">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Precisely. 
    It seems to us a necessary and logical colliery to the theory of a living and viable Constitution, that our trial courts should not be strangled with the immense task of attempting to remake, to rewrite their own history where the truth seeking process of the trial itself was not marred by unfairness. 
    Judgment should be final and result should be secured. 
    I don't think that the price of progress and the events of our understanding of the essential human liberties embraced by the Fourteenth Amendment should be the systematic destruction of the conscientious work of courts applying standards which at the time they were applied were deemed equally reasonable by men of goodwill. 
    It seems to me that neither Mapp nor it's progeny were cases dealing with fair trial. 
    It seems to me that there is an essential distinction between those cases which effect the validity and reliability of the truth seeking process itself. 
    Those cases involving representation by counsel at trails, such as the Gideon case that Mr. Justice Stewart alluded to. 
    Those cases involving confessions which are traditionally unreliable evidence and always have deemed unreliable evidence. 
    And those decisions the focus of which is outside the courtroom, is outside the truth seeking process which is embraced by the concept of due process. 
    It seems to me that the Mapp case did not create a new right 
    I think perhaps it is well for us to pause and consider what the right is that we are addressing ourselves to. 
    Is the right embraced by the Fourth Amendment, the right to retroactivity? 
    Is it the right to exclusion of evidence and evidence proposition? 
    I submit that it is not. 
    I submit that the right announced by the Fourth Amendment is the right which was applied to the states by Wolf against Colorado. 
    I submit that, that right since Wolf has been binding upon state officers and has been a right of the citizens of the various states. 
    And that is the right of all citizens, not just defendants on trial, but of all citizens to be free from arbitrary unreasonable encroachments by state offices into their privacy. 
    Now that is a right which is a non court room right. 
    That is a right which is violated before the judicial machinery that comes into play, and that is a right it seems to me, the violation of which cannot be remedied by retroactive application of the exclusionary rule. 
    The exclusionary rule was adopted we submit as an enforcement device to secure this primary constitutional right. 
    True it is itself a constitutional dimension, but it is not a right derived directly and independently from the Constitution. 
    It seems to me as I read Wolf and Mapp that is Court after announcing the applicability of the primary right to privacy to the states, allowed the states an opportunity, very practically to develop if they could means for securing this right to the citizens of their jurisdiction. 
    It was allowed in Wolf that this might be possible to do it.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    New York is a part of the rule as this Court has. 
    New York is applying the rule I should say of intermediate retroactivity, that is to say the benefits of the Mapp decision belong to all defendants who's cases are decided in the normal course of appeal with the point preserved by objection or by some other means of raising the issue and presenting it to the trial court. 
    In other words those tried before Mapp whose appeals are decided after Mapp get the benefit of the rule. 
    However where the normal appellate process has been exhausted, then a state prisoner who's only recourse is through the Federal Court is denied that right by the Second Circuit opinion reviewed in the companion case today. 
    So that I think retroactivity is itself a matter of degree. 
    It seems to me that retroactivity itself is not at all enough in proposition. 
    Even in Jackson against Denno there was a modified sort of retroactivity imposed in as much as the judgment itself was allowed to remain assuming that a search for prejudice, post-judgment search for prejudice turned out to be negative.

    I can conceive under the Mapp case itself, Mr Justice Clark, I can easily conceive of many, many situations I think several of which have arisen already since Mapp in which there is an inter-relationship between the Fifth and the Fourth. 
    I think that inter-relationship occurs where objects are obtained as a result of coercively obtained information, where there is a seizure which in turn precipitates a confession or an inculpatory declaration very frequently investigated techniques of themselves are intermixed.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I realize the difficulties to avoid Mr. Justice Brennan, but I think for these purposes and now we have to refer to the object of retroactivity, that's the limited question before us and it seems to me that in that context there might be very realistic distinction growing between those object which are obtained in a manner which might affect their reliability as a truth seeking piece of evidence relating to the question of guilt. 
    Now, I suggest that there is no unfairness. 
    There was no unfairness inherent or otherwise essential or otherwise in a trial at which a defendant was convicted by the use of tangible evidence, which was obtained without warrant. 
    It's entirely possible that had that search occurred subsequent to Mapp, there might have been a warrant, there might easily have been evidence to procure the warrant had the police officers knew -- known that they could have done so or that they were obliged to do so. 
    I suggest the evidence itself would have been the same. 
    Indeed, there are many very civilized jurisdictions in the world where evidence is still admissible if it is prohibitive and bears on the issue of guilt regardless of the manner of its acquisition. 
    I assume that there are enforcement devices other than exclusion, but I don't think that the exclusionary rule is itself a new right, a right commensurate with the right to privacy itself.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I used it only as a shorthand device, Justice Black. 
    I am perfectly cognitive of the fact that the amendment is far broader, but I meant to merely make the distinction between the evidentiary aspect and the intrusion aspect. 
    One occurring outside the trial process itself and the other within the trial. 
    Indeed, it's interesting I think that in the companion case, the Angelet case, the court below explicitly found that while finding if there was an unlawful search which we do not concede, but that was the finding below. 
    They found as well that there was no unfairness whatsoever in the trial on which this evidence was admitted. 
    It seems to me that in a world of changing violence where time itself has an extremely important affect upon the law and the lives of men that we cannot encumber our trial courts with re-litigation. 
    Now, one of the practical facts of life is that there is a (Inaudible) and sadly a limited number of court hours at the disposal of the various state jurisdictions. 
    It is no secret that the court calenders and dockets of every court in the country are crowded with defendants, some of whom are unable to make bail, who are awaiting trial and must await trial until there is a free hour in court. 
    Counsel, the demands upon counsels time to represent indigent clients are very, very great and the courts to have wait for the counsel to be free to try a case. 
    These are some of the hard facts of life and I suggest that if the time of the courts is to be consumed with the re-litigation of cases which were decided fairly according to standards which were then controlled, then I suggest that the court will indeed drown under the workload and I do not say and we do not urge here that there will be a jail delivery. 
    We are not here to raise any specter of criminals going free and walking the streets. 
    Our concern here is for the administration of justice itself in the courts. 
    Our concern here is what the proper business of a trial court should be, should it be the current work, the litigation of those who have not yet been tried in their cases or should it be an attempt to rewrite, to remake of the history of the past.

    Mr. Uviller if the data in the appendix to the court's opinion in (Inaudible) against the United States are more or less accurate, this would have a real impact in only something like about 22 states, is that right? 
    That is 26 or 28 states, at least 26 apparently have had an exclusionary rule of their own granting that the standards may vary a little bit from the standards which we now say are applicable the federal constitutional standards. 
    If those data are accurate, would that be right that this would have any real impact and only something less than (Inaudible) states?

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    We will certainly be included, I will say this. 
    I think the Federal Court will be affected and I think that we must bear in mind, that not only those people who are still in jail or on parole and therefore eligible for federal writs would be effected. 
    This decision of retroactivity here would affect everybody who has already been and will in the future be convicted as a multiple offender. 
    And as such, it will reach back into the past or beyond the expiration of sentences that are still being served. 
    I would also say that another deleterious effect will be that those who have received the longest sentences will be those who receive the benefit of retroactivity. 
    Those who are repeaters will receive the benefit of retroactivity, while those on the present standards for the writ of Habeas Corpus who were less blameworthy will have a worse deal. 
    I think that there are inevitable inequities in any development of law or any development. 
    When you live, in what century, in what year you commit the acts you do, cannot fail to have an effect on your life and I dare say that maybe beyond the power of the score of the constitution itself or to correct or such inevitable inequities in the dynamic and developing system of law.

    I think that once the rid of Habeas Corpus is opened for this purpose that opens the flood gates of litigation whether it's in the Federal Courts or in the State Courts. 
    I do not think that the solution of modified retroactivity which was adopted in Jackson against Denno, will be helpful even because again, it's not the burden of a new trial, it's not the not the fear that we won't be able to convict them because we don't have the evidence anymore. 
    We are not interested in that. 
    What we are interested in is the number of courtroom hours that will be consumed to litigate the issue, whether that be on a special hearing of the type that Jackson and Denno advised or whether it be by outright reversal of a conviction and an utterly and completely neutral.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I have a difficulty answering the question Justice Black, only because I have difficulty in conceding the major premise. 
    It seems to me that if a man was convicted by standards which were entirely fair and proper at the time of his conviction, then because we have changed our notions as to a proper enforcement technique or even if we have changed our notions as to the nature of the constitutional right and its dimensions that we do not say, therefore that he is in jail on an unconstitutional conviction. 
    It seems to me that it –-

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If we assume there that all that's been held is, he deprived of a fair trial, what Mapp held was that its unconstitutional under the federal constitution to try him with the evidence they use. 
    At the time they tried it, it was unconstitutional, whatever may have been the standard that they use or the court had said before that unless you say that what we do is just [Inaudible] the constitution from time to time on the basis of our understanding of how shocking it is, so how uncivilized we think it to be.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="3297.941" stopTime="3338.423">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I think that the shock is a factor in the dimensions of due process yes, but I don't suggest for a moment that this Court decides the dimensions of the Constitution on such standards. 
    I do believe that our consciences as civilized people as we progress through history do develop and that our ideas become refined. 
    Now, I am saying in a way that they change and the change is a fact of life. 
    I do not think, however, that a change necessarily undoes that which was deemed to be proper and constitutional in a previous age by a court of equally goodwill at that time.

speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="3404.458" stopTime="3483.151">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I find out in the fourteenth amendment Justice Black and I dare say that this Court has refrained in the past from adopting the theory that any overruling of a previous decision on constitutional grounds necessarily carries back to the beginning of history. 
    What disturbs is here essentially I think, Justice Black if I may just answer the question at a little bit greater length, I think that what disturbs us here is the fact that prisoners carry with them for years to come the effects of the adjudication upon them and consequently, they live into different years. 
    If the judgment were final and there were no effects of itself in future years, I don't think that we would seriously trouble ourselves with whether or not the person who has been convicted ten or twenty years ago should have that conviction overturned as a matter of academic interest. 
    It is only because of the fact that that's certain stretches out into a era in which our notions of fairness and due process have changed and developed and improved. 
    It seems to me that to take this Blackstonian view about the development of law would be a unrealistic and impractical view.

    Mr. Euel A. Screws, Jr. 
    Just a few comments Your Honor. 
    Mr. Uviller comes in and says that we are not contending that we are going to open the -- this decision retroactively is going to open the jail house doors, but in the same breath he says the courts will drown under the workload on flood of litigation. 
    I think that this is an attack upon the Mapp decision itself, not upon the retroactive application effect. 
    I think that this has been asked by this Court in the Gideon case, it's a speculative argument and is one that there is any legal writers on one side as is there are on the other. 
    But I will point out this to the Court, it is simply impressive to me that our many states in which the retroactivity of Mapp has not be been decided and there are several circuits. 
    They are now enough cases to get – and I think that this as valid as Mr. Uviller's opening the door arguments. 
    The second point he makes is there is no unfairness in the trail based on illegalacies tangible evidence and again I want to point out to this Court that the trail would never have occurred under the Fourth Amendment. 
    It was a legal search because the evidence seized could not be seized under the search that was made against Mr. Linkletter, assuming a search warrant. 
    This guilt or innocence argument, the fairness of the trial argument has been passed by this Court in coerced confession cases. 
    It has been held as an immaterial consideration in Rogers versus Richmond and Hayes versus Washington case and I could not see Mapp personally as an academic principle, but only as personal constitutional right which this Court has said should be applied to all individuals.
