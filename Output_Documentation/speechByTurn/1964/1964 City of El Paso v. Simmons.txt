    Number 38, City of El Paso versus Greenberry Simmons. 
    Mr. Mounce.
speaker="william_j_mounce" startTime="11.962" stopTime="95.237">
    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case involves title to approximately 620 acres of land located in El Paso County, Texas. 
    At the trial court, both sides moved for summary judgment. 
    The City of El Paso's motion was granted and the “at motion” of the appellee Simmons was denied. 
    On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed case. 
    The facts in this particular case may be very briefly stated. 
    The appellee Simmons, predecessors in title, purchased these lands involved from the State of Texas in 1910. 
    The predecessors in title failed to pay interest on the original purchase and the lands were forfeited to the State of Texas in 1947 and reverted to the public domain. 
    Simmons acquired title in June of 1952, and in the latter part of July, attempted to reinstate the original purchases. 
    His tendered reinstatement was refused because of the fact that they had not been received by the Land Commissioner within the five years prescribed by the statute within effect.

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    By quitclaim deed.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    By quitclaim deed from --
speaker="william_j_mounce" startTime="100.937" stopTime="421.981">
    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    From mean grantees of the original purchasers. 
    In the latter part of 1955, these lands were awarded to the City of El Paso. 
    And in 1956, they were actually patented to the City of El Paso. 
    And this suit was filed in the latter part of August in 1961. 
    At the time that these lands were purchased from the State of Texas, there was a statute in effect which I believe is 4218 which regulated the one man that the State of Texas might terminate land purchase contracts. 
    And that statute provides that a land purchase agreement might be reinstated by paying up all back interest providing that no rights of the third parties had intervened. 
    This particular statute was amended in 1941 to provide that in case that lands were forfeited for the nonpayment of interest that the lands may be reinstated by making payment of all back interest due, and provided that that by it's no third party have intervened and added one proviso that this must be accomplished within five years. 
    So the question therefore presented for this Court at this time is whether the application of the statute of 1941 which is Article 5336 impairs the obligation of these original contracts. 
    It is the position of the City of El Paso that the proviso requiring that the reinstatement that the land purchase agreements be reinstated within the five-year period is merely a remedy. 
    In other words, it's one of the methods by which the State of Texas enforces its contracts and it's not necessarily an obligation of the contract. 
    As a matter of fact, in order to determine whether a contract obligation has been impaired, one must first determine what the obligations are in the contract. 
    And in this respect, we're guided by some cases decided for this Court in 1900, which considering con -- land purchase contracts from the State of Texas substantially the same as the contracts not in consideration held that the obligations of the contract were one, that the purchaser would pay down a certain sum of money and make these payments each year until he'd paid it off and whenever he had paid his money, although required by the contract, then the State of Texas would issue patent that this purely and simply with obligations of the contract. 
    That the method by which the State of Texas enforced the particular obligations and terminated the contract rights referred merely to the remedy and consequently could be modified from time to time as long as the changes were reasonable. 
    And we submit that this is precisely what we have here. 
    The State has merely modified the manner in which it terminates the land purchase contracts. 
    And it's not necessarily impaired obligation for the contract. 
    We feel that this case is probably squarely or almost squarely in point with that of Aikins versus Kingsbury which is decided by this Court in the 1920s. 
    That involved a California Land Purchase Agreement. 
    At the time the lands were originally purchased the only method by which the State of California can terminate the purchase contract, would be to actually file a quiet title action, obtain a judgment. 
    Then the purchaser had 20 days after the judgment was entered within which to come in and redeem his purchase or by paying all back sums due plus all court costs. 
    Now, this particular Act was amended some 20 years after the original purchaser bought his land to provide that if the contracts were in default that the purchaser would have six months from the date of the Act within which to reinstate his purchase, otherwise, he completely loss everything. 
    And that particular original purchaser or his successor contended that this was an impairment of obligations of his contract and this Court held that it was not an obligation. 
    That is merely a change of remedy or merely a change in the method by which the State terminated its contract which it could do from time to time so long as the modification was reasonable.

    Yes. 
    But the fact, and I'll be real candid at this point, the facts regarding adverse position are quite skimpy. 
    And that is charitable as I can be about those particular facts. 
    So as a practical matter, our big defense was this 1941 statute which we believe is constitutional. 
    And the question is as to the constitutionality of this particular statute unless they appeal.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Mounce, under your theory, how long could you find have continued to fail to pay the interest and still have enjoyed the use of the property.

    Oh yes -- yes I --
speaker="william_j_mounce" startTime="523.044" stopTime="529.102">
    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Well, under the theory that's enunciated by the Fifth Circuit --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="529.102" stopTime="530.070">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's what I meant --
speaker="william_j_mounce" startTime="530.070" stopTime="580.215">
    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    It appears that he could continue to do that until some third party's rights had intervened. 
    In other words, their theory is that before the State of Texas could terminate this contract even though it's in default admittedly that they must create rights in another. 
    And as we stated this common knowledge, the State of Texas doesn't sell its land anymore. 
    It did back in 1910 but all they sell them in very rare instances but under the theory enunciated by the Fifth Circuit before these rights would be terminated, the State would have to create rights in another. 
    And now the decisions of the Texas court which followed out, these rights would have to write them into a patent. 
    And we submit that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="580.215" stopTime="589.078">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, so long as remained in the -- in the ownership of the State, they could continue to fail to pay --
speaker="william_j_mounce" startTime="589.078" stopTime="836.878">
    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Perpetually, they could continue to fail to pay the interest, so long as the title remains in the state. 
    I might briefly call the Court's attention. 
    I have to apologize first for the scrappiness of the record. 
    We both move for summary judgments consequently the case wouldn't as fully developed as we might have liked in the trial court. 
    But the particular statute involved was submitted in 1941. 
    It's Chapter 191 of the Acts of 1941 of the Texas legislature. 
    That particular statute is in two parts. 
    The first part provided that the State or that the State provided that any purchaser of these lands could defer payments of the principal for the next four years. 
    The second part of the statute of -- added the five-year proviso. 
    And as Mr. Simmons has pointed out in his brief, the State of Texas on many, many occasions have amended or modified this -- these Land Acts. 
    The most common type of modification is that each two years, the State provides that the principal payments may be deferred that the purchasers need only pay interest. 
    Now, the record shows, I believe, that Mr. Simmons predecessors entitled avail themselves of the first section of this particular Act and now are complaining of the second section. 
    We think it's questionable whether they actually even have a right to complain since they avail themselves of the benefits conferred by the first section of this particular Act and now they complain about the five-year proviso in the second provision of the Act. 
    One other matter, I would like to bring up this time. 
    I think the provi -- and that is the Appendix K that's been submitted by the appellee wherein he made several requests for admissions while this case was pending on appeal in the United States Supreme Court. 
    And as he shows in there, we filed objections to these requests for admissions but nevertheless they are brought here in the record. 
    I feel that they have absolutely no bearing on this particular case at this particular time. 
    I would further point out that in conferences between myself and Mr. Simmons' local counsel, the Court so stated they all might as would be held in advance. 
    We practice a little bit more informally out in El Paso when we don't file orders of everything but I do believe that the -- the so-called facts and conclusions set forth in Appendix K to the appellee's brief and absolutely no bearing on this particular question. 
    I would like, if I might, to reserve the bulk of my time for rebuttal. 
    However, I do call again reiterate that this position of the appellant that this particular statute merely modified the remedy by which the State of Texas terminated its land purchase contractual rights and did not impair obligations of the contract between the State of Texas and Mr. Simmons' predecessors in title. 
    I will concede, however, there -- there is some dicta in some earlier Texas cases that might support the proposition that the right of reinstatement was invested right. 
    However, I submit a careful reading of those cases will reveal that they are merely dicta. 
    The statement was more or less gratuitous and was not necessary to the decision of the case pending. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Greenberry Simmons
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="836.878" stopTime="844.035">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Simmons.
speaker="greenberry_simmons" startTime="844.035" stopTime="1314.670">
    Mr. Greenberry Simmons 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We've referred a great deal recently about the constitutional rights of the American Indians, and we have also heard a great deal about the constitutional rights of the American Negroes. 
    But very seldom that in this Court do we have the opportunity to direct our attention to the constitutional rights of the American settlers that helped settled up this western boundaries with reference to their homes and their home sites. 
    This is such a suit. 
    We have gone into focus here the impairment of the obligation of contract Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of which the members of this Court know long before well provides that no state shall pass any Act impairing the obligation of contract. 
    Now, since that was put in, in this Constitution of ours, it has lost a great deal of its potentiality. 
    However, in regards to land grants by the State and contracts pertaining to land grants by the State and the Government, it still carries a quite of great deal of potentiality. 
    Now, before we can determine whether this contract has been impaired, we of course have to determine what the obligations of both parties were at the time the contract was made back in 1910, not and under the laws at that time, not under the laws as they might be today after being amended so many times. 
    Now, on page 67 of the record -- 67 of the record, we have the contract which is before the Court today. 
    That contract was made by settlers Glenn and Kilpatrick in 1910, when it applied to the State of Texas for the purchase of their homes and their home sites. 
    Found down here about a third of the page from the bottom, we have the word which is hidden here O-B-L-I-G-A-T-I-O-N and of course the obligation of this contract is from there on down with reference to the statutes they refer to. 
    Now, what does the obligation of this contract specifically express and stipulate as to the terms of the obligation itself. 
    That's what we're -- we're trying to find out here, the obligation itself. 
    I have this day prchased from the State of Texas under the provisions of and in accordance with, and let me emphasize that, under the provisions of and in accordance with Chapter 129 of the Acts of May 19, 1897, now there it is in the obligation of the contract. 
    Now, what does Chapter 129 say pertaining to the particular thing which is before this Court today namely the reinstatement of property which was already forfeited. 
    At page 8 of the brief for the appellee, page 8. 
    There is set out two paragraphs there which take -- which is part of Chapter 129 which set out the obligations of both parties, the settlers and their vendees, and the State of Texas. 
    Now, what does it say? 
    In the second paragraph here it says, this land is to be sold to settlers, actual settlers only. 
    And after they have spent three years on their lands, they may have a patent at anytime. 
    Now, that's fairly clear. 
    I'm speaking now of the obligation of this contract, not just the contract itself, the obligation of this contract stipulated and expressed. 
    What else does it say pertaining to this subject that we want to talk about? 
    It says, if any of these lands are forfeited for the nonpayment of interest, they may be reinstated by the purchaser or the vendee by paying all back interest into the treasury and by giving written notice before the rights of third parties may have intervened. 
    That means before this date sold that land to a third party. 
    Now, what we have just discussed here are the obligations of the State to do certain things. 
    What? 
    If these settlers pay their back interest before they resell it to some third person, then what? 
    This contract comes back into being just the same as it was when it's written.

    Mr. Greenberry Simmons 
    Yes, yes, and if -- that's right. 
    And it would be indefinite until they sold that land before and -- and the reason is very good about that. 
    It was customary down there for these settlers when they moved on this land to pay for years and then all at once, and I'm coming to that in a few minutes, all at once not able to pay their interest. 
    They didn't get off the land then. 
    It was only when they resold that land because you have got a statute here which they contracted in the obligation to do the terms of the contract. 
    And it -- and as long as they held that land, they could -- while they have lived on this land for 40 or 50 years as a whole -- and for a long period of time. 
    Then the successors, the vendees went in the same position. 
    Yes sir, that's exactly what the Court of Appeals held that they had that right. 
    That's exactly what they held that they -- this was not a remedy but it was an obligation of the State right here. 
    Now, if it had been customary -- well, of course customary, we're not interested in customary. 
    Too much in regards to this matter. 
    But anyway they did not have to -- they generally did not move on if they didn't pay. 
    It was only after they resold, they lived there with the expectation for years.

    If we -- we came, that's right. 
    That's been amended several times since then. 
    But how can you change the terms of your obligation, the terms of your obligation by any statute, regardless of what its remedy or substance, you cannot do that under the courts, I mean under this Court's rulings.

    Those statements say that they had the right to amend the statute with reference to forfeiture for nonpayment. 
    And that that's all it did. 
    They -- you would not pay for many years, the statute was amended in 1941, and you forfeit your land in 1947, and stated more, so State claims I suppose that after 1947 that they'd own these properties.

    The State didn't own the prop -- any property subject to the obligation of this statute. 
    The State did that -- when -- when it was forfeited, it went back to the school fund.

    Mr. Greenberry Simmons 
    Well, the Court of Appeals, of course, they cited that case and that's the first time that this -- this city had ever presented that case. 
    When the Court of Appeals cited it in their opinion and still ruled against them, but of course here is the -- here is the -- yes, the difference. 
    The terms of this contract here are different than the redemption statute that was in the California statute. 
    The California statute did not provide so far as we can see in the case and here it is, we can't find where the statute in the California case provided the same things in the obligation of the contract itself; namely, to reinstate if they paid up before this result. 
    They didn't have that in the obligation stipulated in the obligation, in the Aikins case. 
    I mean we can't find if it's in there. 
    It merely says that in 20 days, it's an ordinary redemption case. 
    This is not an ordinary redemption case. 
    This is not an ordinary, just an ordinary. 
    You pay interest and we give you patent. 
    You can see that this is a -- this is an altogether different situation. 
    Why? 
    And you can see it by what they have -- the State has agreed to do in this case. 
    If you come on this land with eight inches of rain on it, and -- and live on it, and build your home on it a year, average mean eight inches, we will do this for you. 
    And now they're trenching on it after the men live on it, and build their homes, and did this. 
    The State has time to flitch and say, “No, that was not the contract. 
    We have entered just a remedy.” 
    It was more than a remedy and the Court of Appeals so held it was more than a remedy.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2211.369" stopTime="2247.082">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    This is the language that I wanted -- what you -- what you -- how would you handle it. 
    The counsel quotes this language from that case. 
    “The right of the State to foreclose such a contract for default in payment and the right of the purchaser to redeem after a default decree relate to the remedy as distinguished from the obligation of the contract and both of these rights are constitutionally subject to modification by the State within limits which were not exceeded in the Act before us.” 
    Now that's the language that that --
speaker="greenberry_simmons" startTime="2247.082" stopTime="2443.962">
    Mr. Greenberry Simmons 
    That's the language and -- and the obligation of this contract is that whether this is a remedy or whether this is substance, or even procedure. 
    They contracted their right away in the obligation of this contract. 
    Now we had -- this the -- we have several cases of course, when we come to them. 
    I mean this Court has held. 
    The principle that I -- we are going on Your Honors please is as old as Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall's court in 1823. 
    It's Green against Biddle. 
    And it said if the terms of the contract itself now if -- and it's cited on page, the last page, 54 in this Appendix D. 
    If the terms of the obligation or the terms of the contract itself says certain things even though their remedies, it makes no difference whether it's a remedy or whether it's substance. 
    If the terms of the obligation say so, then any -- and what does the Constitution say? 
    It says on page two right here, is -- is of course I know that -- that Your Honors are all familiar with it but we have -- might reflect a recollection. 
    "No State shall pass any -- shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contract.” 
    Now, we are trying -- we found out what the obligation is here. 
    Now, if it is in where -- here is -- here has been in the trouble. 
    The problem that we most have had in the past with these cases in all these hu -- history of this -- this Court, is searching out what the obligation of the contracts are. 
    Now, if the oblig -- if we can't find that in the obligation itself, then what you say of course -- what we are saying, then they can amend, and then they can deal with remedies. 
    But if we have stipulated and if we do find in the obligation itself like we find this language here what to do, then that is different that then even if you -- if you have stipulated, you're about it, it can't then be impaired in anyway. 
    That's what it said, that if the obligation covers it, that it's covered in the obligation, you can't -- we can't pass any law that shall impair it. 
    But now just the -- we have to tell a little of what these sellers did I think on this land before. 
    I mean they -- they went on the land and they built a house, and they spent three years, and they got a certificate of three-year residence all of these is in the -- in the record of this case.

    They couldn't get back at the turn of the century when this -- this statute is passed in 1897. 
    They couldn't get any money to stay on that land and that's really the trouble. 
    So that's where we made the statute. 
    That's when they obligated themselves like this. 
    And these people went on and stayed there. 
    And of course, there's no doubt about the -- the New Jersey case of Wilson if -- if we have the same identical rights that the -- that the -- the settler had.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I will try to address myself, answer some of the questions propounded by members of the Court. 
    First question is how long that the contracts have been in default? 
    I believe the record shows that they became in default in November of 1950 -- 1946. 
    Also the method of distinguishing Aikins --

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Yes sir, the first default on the interest, the State mailed a letter to the last known address of these particular purchasers, advice them of the fact that they had not paid the interest on November 1, 1956 whenever it was --

    I'm sorry, it's 1946, 1946 whenever it was due and advice them that if the payments were made -- not made by the 21st of July 1947, that the lands would be forfeited. 
    Shortly thereafter, after the particular date cited, the July 21, 1947 date, the Land Commissioner again notified these people at their last known address advised them that the State had forfeited the lands in accordance with the established procedure whereby all they do is mark on the file record that the land is forfeited from nonpayment of interest. 
    And at that time, submitted them a summary of this particular statute which is now under consideration, explaining how they would have to reinstate the purchasers.

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Well, there really wasn't much possession taken and I'd be quite frank with you. 
    We alleged the defense of adverse possession state -- I mean the City of El Paso was holding record title. 
    There were some acts of possession as questionable whether they're sufficient to sustain a defense of adverse possession because the particular nature of this land is raw and it's undeveloped. 
    Its location really is what gives you its primary value. 
    Now, does that answer your question?

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Thank you. 
    I'd like to pass on to the method by which the appellee attempted to distinguish agents. 
    It states that these matters were inclusive in the contract. 
    I don't know the contract was not set forth in any of the particular cases either the Supreme Court case in the State of California decision. 
    However, I think that's completely immaterial because regardless of whether they're set forth verbatim in the contract itself, people contract with regard to existent law. 
    I think that's home book proposition law that needs no particular citation. 
    And it is our position their own principle, the Aikins decision cannot be distinguished from our situation as a matter of principle.

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Well as far as the -- as far as I can tell from any decision, I haven't seen the particular contract involved in Aikins but the decision says that the only obligations were, one, that the purchaser would pay the purchase price and two, upon payment in full that the State would issue a patent for the land. 
    Now, I assume they are the same because Aikins caught in a favor of the two Supreme Court cases which decided a Texas purchase contract which says essentially the same thing that those with the obligations contained in a Texas Land Purchase Agreement that one, the purchaser pays the money, and two, whenever he did that, that the State would issue a patent.

    Mr. William J. Mounce 
    Well, they don't -- well on the obligation of the contract but they do say this that at the title of the contract, the way the State would terminate these contractual rights was this. 
    It would file a lawyer's -- essentially a quiet title action. 
    And after the -- if the State got a judgment, then the purchaser would have 20 days after entry of that particular judgment within which to come in and pay up all back moneys plus court cost. 
    And then he would get his land back. 
    Now, that's -- I can see no real material distinction between what we have here. 
    The State of California lend them a minute, their action said they didn't have to file a quiet title action at all. 
    If the guy had -- the purchaser had been in default for a certain length of the time five -- which incidentally was five years, if he didn't come in within 60 days from the date to processes this Act and pay -- and reinstate his purchase, he lost all claim to the land. 
    And that's essentially what we have here.

    No sir. 
    But we have one other factor here. 
    As I mentioned, before this particular statute has been -- these Land Acts have been amended numerous times.

    I don't think you find them set out, quoted verbatim in the brief of the record, Your Honor. 
    But that the record does show that Mr. Simmons as predecessors of title avail themselves of this particular section of the statute and nearly made an interest payment rather than paying their principal as the so-called -- as the contract -- contract provided. 
    They avail themselves the benefit of the particular statute and now they refuse to buy it by the burdens of the statute.
