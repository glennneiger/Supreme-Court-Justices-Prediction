    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Smith.
speaker="ewell_lee_smith_jr" startTime="24.276" stopTime="428.756">
    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    It is a very high professional honor for me to appear before this Court. 
    I'd like to say at the beginning that I'm fully aware of the importance of the question to the jurisprudence of our country to be decided here today. 
    I hope I may be of assistance to the Court and that I may do justice to the cause of my client. 
    This is an adoption case, first to be considered by this Court on adoption validity. 
    It is important I think because we are mobile people, historically on the move and adoptions have become very numerous. 
    It is important because it involves domestic law, one of the chief categories of the law since the Code of Hammurabi and before. 
    There are two points involved and two of them. 
    First at Section 6 of Article 46a, Texas' revised statutes is constitution because it purports to dispense with the consent of natural parents in an adoption proceeding without any provision for notice. 
    Secondly, that we have been deprived of due process of the law that the failure of the Texas Courts to give notice to the natural father of a proceeding to adopt his child. 
    Not only do I appear here in a representative capacity for the bench and the Bar but our petition for a simple, direct, and specific justice. 
    I shall address myself first to the facts, secondly to the procedural facts, thirdly to the law, and lastly to the possible and actual consequences of harm from this action. 
    My client was made rather late in life. 
    He is the natural father of but one child, a girl, the subject of this adoption. 
    His wife who had been married once before and had mothered and lost the custody of two children by her former husband, divorced him in Fort Worth, Texas in November of 1959 and received custody of his only child subject to the usual rights of reasonable visitation in my client. 
    At the time of the divorce, my client suffered complete physical and mental breakdown. 
    He was carried to the hospital by his just divorced wife. 
    He was not to recover from this condition for over a year. 
    His former wife had been moved to El Paso, Texas some 550 miles west of Fort Worth and within four months after the divorce, remade for the third time to a Mr. Manzo, a divorced man with three smaller children. 
    She took with her Molly, age three, the child of my client is subject to this case. 
    Now my client Mr. Armstrong is a native of Fort Worth, Texas. 
    He's lived there for over 40 years. 
    His parents have lived there for many years before him and all are well-known. 
    Texas has an adoption statute which provides among other things that no child maybe adopted without the consent of his natural parents unless such parent or parents shall have voluntarily abandoned said child for two years and shall have left the child to the care, custody, and control of others, or in the disjunctive, such parent shall not have contributed substantially to the support of such child during such period of two years, commensurate with his financial ability. 
    It is the second of this that we're concerned with here today. 
    When he was divorced, my client was ordered to pay $50 a month child support beginning November 16th, 1959. 
    It is undisputed that he paid as total sum of $200. 
    This would have carried him from November 16th, 1959 up until March the 16th, 1960, some four months. 
    The trial court and the appellate court by some subjective or otherwise unascertainable standard, even though the divorce was not decided until November 6, 1959 and the payments were not to begin until November 16th, 1959, decided that the payments were for -- from November the 1st, the date prior to the divorce itself. 
    And therefore, two years from the four-month period ending March the 1st the Court said, Section 2 of the statute came into operation, he had not -- if he had not supported the child commensurate with his financial ability from that period on, then they had jurisdiction. 
    This was the first, and in my judgment, most fundamental jurisdictional decision made by a series of Texas Courts apparently calculated to reason around or to ignore constitutional rights and guarantees a due process. 
    If the Court please, I think it was a studied attempt to run this adoption through against the wishes of his father without notice to him. 
    Now, let me make it clear now that this is not a custody case and again the classical sense of that term. 
    There should have been no issue concerning the welfare of the child in his adoption in the beginning. 
    Custody was with the mother by decree of the District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. 
    The father did have limited custody. 
    This limited custody consisted of a court order giving him reasonable visitation at reasonable times. 
    I mentioned that because although it's not classically custody, it does have elements of custody in it. 
    The issue here is simply, whether a Court can completely cut the man off from his own child without even the right of visitation, taking away his name, his heritage, his parentage, terminating if the Court please in the words of Section 9 of the statute, all legal relationship, all rights and duties, all against his will without even notice. 
    The procedural facts are as follows. 
    With one small capsule of time on March the 12th, 1962, three events took place. 
    First, the mother filed at two sentence self-serving affidavit, alleging nonsupport of the child for two years. 
    This was filed in 120th District Court in El Paso. 
    On the same day, the judge of the 41st District Court next door found nonsupport solely on the basis of his self-serving two sentence affidavit and granted his consent. 
    Now, I neglected to say that if these two events come to pass in the statute then the parental consent shall not be necessary but the consent of the juvenile judge or the Judge of the County Court if there is no juvenile judge shall be necessary. 
    So the judge of the 41st District Court on the two sentence affidavit gave his consent to the adoption which had meanwhile then filed in the 120th Court on the same day. 
    All of these three events took place on March the 12th, 1962. 
    No inquiry was made concerning Mr. Armstrong's whereabouts. 
    No notice of any kind was given him.

    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    This kind of evidence was taken. 
    The father testified that he had a complete physical and mental breakdown. 
    He was under the care of a doctor. 
    He was not to recover from this for over two months -- I mean for over six months. 
    He for a while had a temporary job as assistant city prosecutor in Fort Worth. 
    He was so nervous and so mentally ill that he could not hold this job down. 
    The testimony further was that he earned a total of $650 I believe it was in that year, probably more than next year. 
    The deposition of his doctor was introduced. 
    This deposition showed that beyond any question, he had a nervous breakdown, a mental illness, and the doctor said he would be surprised if he recovered from any less from his condition any less than six months --

    Well, on the technical attack, on the evidence itself, the Court completely ignored the constitutional ground. 
    Now I say this, under our procedure, and while we're on this point although I intended to get to it later, we might as well take it out now. 
    Under Section 7 of the Adoption Act, an adoption can be attacked if the adoptive parents can be shown to be immoral, a severe thing, that's not in the issue here. 
    Another means of attack is a motion for a new trial which we've already discussed here. 
    Another means of possible attack --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What is open to him on a motion for new trial? 
    Is there a shift, the burden of proof or anything of that kind?
speaker="ewell_lee_smith_jr" startTime="672.057" stopTime="701.500">
    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    Your Honor, there are eight different ways that this motion for new a trial is more burdensome. 
    Of course I don't think I need to -- I'll going to answer those eight things but I think it's self-evident to anybody who's ever handled a case that he'd rather go in and that his rights are fuller having a mere preponderance of the evidence than to have to upset the burden of proof and to convince a trial judge that he did a thing which was abusive in the first place. 
    So I think it's self-evident that this hearing was not equivalent to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="701.500" stopTime="730.914">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you are suggesting then that suppose the statute said required notice to the father in these circumstances but said that it if he has failed to contribute substantially his support to the child for two years that he still have the burden of proof at the hearing. 
    Are you -- you're saying that the -- you're saying that that kind of a shifting of the burden --

speaker="ewell_lee_smith_jr" startTime="734.891" stopTime="759.188">
    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    Firstly I'll say this that if the statute provided for notice, that would go a long way to accruing this up. 
    And if he -- if the -- the case has hold in other states that the legislature has the right to say under what conditions parental right shall be exercised. 
    But I don't know that the state has a right to arbitrarily asses a burden of proof any way it wants to.

    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    Let me put some of the incidents of a motion for new trial under our practice before the Court. 
    I think it would be germane to this point. 
    The ex parte proceeding must be discovered within 10 days. 
    The motion must be filed within 10 days. 
    In a nonjury case, no motion for new trial has to be filed as a prerequisite to appeal. 
    So 30 days later, the judgment is filed. 
    The person moving for a new trial has a burden of proof to set aside whereas the adoptive parents would have had the burden on proper notice. 
    Third, we now have the burden of convincing the judge that he did an unfair thing in the first place and not giving us notice. 
    Fourth, the legal presumption is that the best interest of the child lies in its own natural parents. 
    This is the law in every state.

    The record shows that in this two year period ensuing from the divorce until the time of the adoption, the child visited for four extended visits in Fort Worth of a month at a time. 
    This is custody. 
    This is a thing we've been cut off from. 
    This is the thing that we have no presumption in our favor regardless on a motion for new trial.

    As we understand it, that's the holding of the previous case. 
    And then in this case, they did reverse the judgment of adoption and sent it back to the trial court for a full hearing. 
    Isn't that correct? 
    And is --

    But it was once said by the Supreme Court in DeWitt versus Brooks therefore we're going to follow it.

    I'm glad you've asked me about that, Your Honor. 
    I'm very glad you asked about that. 
    That's cited by the opponent. 
    I think just a cursory glance of that case will indicate what I'm talking about. 
    Look at the special issue which are raised in that case, when the mother comes in, not having been given notice to set aside one of these things before jury. 
    The jury has asked, “Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that she did not fail to support this child?” 
    Commensurate with her financial ability for two years. 
    Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that she did not surrender the care or custody and control of the child for a period of two years? 
    I think that case indicates how onerous this burden of proof is. 
    And while I'm discussing the cases that are raised by our opponent, I want to talk about this (Inaudible), which is a case that came out after we filed our brief here cited by them. 
    Where a person in this situation, a father who was not a party to the original proceeding tried to bring this question up by a writ of error, an application for writ of error to the Court of Civil Appeals from the Court of Civil Appeals to the District Court. 
    And our position cites this as showing that the -- that he had a remedy below. 
    But if the court would read that case, he doesn't say that at all. 
    It says, he may perhaps have some remedy below. 
    We don't know but it's not by a write -- writ of error. 
    Now the reason they said, he had no right to go out by writ of error, was that he was not a party to the original proceeding which gives me back to the point on this motion for new trial. 
    Ordinarily, in any kind of case, a person who is not a party to a lawsuit can't come in by way of motion for new trial.

    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    The way you can come at these things is either by a motion for new trial or a writ of - an application for writ of habeas corpus or an Equitable Bill of Review. 
    I submit all of these inadequate. 
    All of them are more onerous than a trial upon notice in the first place although there are variations in these three procedures. 
    They're all more onerous. 
    Now, any day now I expect that we can see the courts of Texas come out following (Inaudible) and say you have no standing to come in by a motion for new trial. 
    So you'd be relegated to an application for habeas corpus.

    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    The burden is on the moving party, Your Honor and it's a strenuous one. 
    In an application for an Equitable Bill of Review, you've not only got to show all these other things but you got to show a present, meritorious defense. 
    And in a case of a child custody case, if the child has been in the custody of the adoptive parents for three years, due to an unconstitutional act of the trial court, then you got a different question when you'd come up on a motion for Bill of Review. 
    What is your present meritorious defense? 
    What is the best answers to the child who was taken from the mom like for three years? 
    I'd say it in conclusion that the law, on most states so far as I've been able to find them comports with what we've said in our brief. 
    This is the law in Missouri. 
    This is the law in Illinois as said to deprive a parent of his rights without notice, an opportunity is not only contrary, they have a principle of natural justice but is prohibited by the constitution, California has said it. 
    It happens in state unquestionably due process of law demands some sufficient notice to the parents or the proceeding about to be taken where the opportunity to the parents to be heard upon the issues. 
    North Dakota said it, all of these cases are cases where there's an exception to parental consent. 
    These states say if he's insane, a guardian ad litem must be appointed to protect his interest. 
    If he's in prison, someone has to come in and show that fact. 
    Whatever the legislature has provided, the constitution requires notice.

    That issue is not between you.
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="1603.299" stopTime="1756.676">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    No, it should have been given in this case and should be given in any case where it's physically possible in any manner that do so. 
    And we suppose that the error that was made in this case in that regard where the man was right there in Fort Worth and could have been served. 
    The error that was made here arose from the fact that our party's then counsel either misconceived of what the cases and felt that they could go ahead and get a judgment that would be good or for some reason advised the people to go ahead without notice. 
    But that was an error because the Texas cases are clear in numerous cases that that judgment was only good until it came into question by the party whose notice had been omitted. 
    And so that's what took place here. 
    The -- if it happened that this new father of the child, that is the husband of the mother on the day after the adoption was -- order was entered, wrote to a member of the family, the father of the petitioner here and said, “We've taken this order of adoption here in El Paso”. 
    And our party was the commanding officer at Biggs Air Force Base. 
    And let me say right here, of course that there weren't any questions about the fitness of the parties here. 
    It didn't even come in to question when the full hearing was had because there's not any question about the fitness of the parties here. 
    And so he wrote and therefore, the petitioner came in and filed a -- what was first hold, a motion for new trial or a motion for new trial and a motion that the judgment be vacated. 
    Now in regard to a motion for new trial, we are talking about an instrument that was filed and called a motion for new trial as a name or a motion to vacate the judgment. 
    But what actually transpired here is that the judge set down for a hearing the motion that they had filed and then postponed the hearing on it so that the parties could go to Fort Worth and take their positions and on a date certain, set the motion again. 
    And then the parties came in and put on testimony from live witnesses and from deposition witnesses so that there was a full scale hearing where the judge set again to determine the facts that were essential or in issue in this adoption.

speaker="william_duncan" startTime="1762.588" stopTime="1792.904">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    That is -- what is of -- we say the record shows here, Your Honor because he heard the testimony just as the Texas cases said that he must.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Mr. Duncan, there is in the field of practical difference here, though, isn't there -- if the Court had set aside the adoption judgment, then of course, the party seeking adoption would have had to go forward again and show why they were entitled to adoption, the burden would be on them. 
    But in the hearing that you get under the Texas Law as I read what happened, the party challenging -- the party who didn't get the notice was to come in and file his motion and proceed them to contest the ultimate fact upon which the adoption depends, isn't that it?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2224.515" stopTime="2225.555">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2225.555" stopTime="2240.309">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    And the party who had incurred the adoption doesn't go forward with any evidence at all to show why he was entitled the adoption except to rebut the case that the party who did not get notice puts in, isn't that correct?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2240.309" stopTime="2241.081">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2241.081" stopTime="2243.344">

speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2243.344" stopTime="2276.461">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir and as you said, there's a practical difference or practical problem involved and that was also in the fact that the judges are human and maybe they are inclined to say, "Well, in the back of my mind, what I'm looking for here is evidence to support my prior judgment". 
    I realized the human element that comes into it there. 
    But on the other hand, here is a judge who's on the bench, under oath, sitting there and trying a nonjury case and the cases have told him inquire into a -- by a full hearing, inquire into the -- what I call the grounds for this adoption.

speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2291.647" stopTime="2339.422">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Well I think it's a confusion that comes up even to good lawyers who haven't stop to think about it as I have them too much but the difference between notice and consent, a statute that dispenses with consent is -- would be entirely different from a statute that attempted to dispense with notice. 
    That you can conceive a case where a man had been given no -- had been given notice. 
    And he comes into court and he litigates nonsupport for instance or abandonment. 
    And he winds up saying, “Judge, I don't consent to this adoption”. 
    And the judge says, “It doesn't matter. 
    This is grounds for adoption and I'm going to grant the adoption”. 
    And so that kind of confusion in just day to day practical practicing of law has resulted in these cases.

    Mr. William Duncan 
    Well it's true, Your Honor, there was no testimony put on in the full hearing but it was in the record -- in the papers in the case, in the District Court's office in this lawsuit that the father came in to -- that here was a report of the investigator. 
    So that if that report or the record on -- already on the case on which the Court had found the fitness of this adoptive father, if that were to be put an issue, it could have been litigated in this but it was not put in issue.

    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask this, Mr. Duncan. 
    Is this the question we have to decide if the failure to give notice was a constitutional, federal constitutionally infirmity in the proceedings, can that infirmity be redressed short of scrubbing the whole slate clean in giving a brand -- starting a brand new proceeding. 
    Isn't that the issue before us?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2666.282" stopTime="2669.978">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    That states it, I believe, yes sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2669.978" stopTime="2693.501">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And the reference to that as I understand you to say, under the law of Texas, under this case, although a moving party would've had to go forward in their case the first time, the judgment was not to say -- to set aside and a new trial given under the same circumstances before which shifted the burden of proof to him. 
    Is that right?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2693.501" stopTime="2696.008">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir, there wasn't any express shifting of the burden of proof but that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2696.008" stopTime="2696.693">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But then you (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2696.693" stopTime="2696.949">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    That's the (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2696.949" stopTime="2698.001">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But that's what the result --
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2698.001" stopTime="2699.028">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    That did result here.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2699.028" stopTime="2729.092">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We must consider the any man would avoid judgment against him because of an unconstitutional to say -- to give notice. 
    He didn't have its original trial. 
    The law of Texas say, "You should never have that kind of original trial again", even though the -- either the -- there was no notice given in the first case. 
    He can't have it because the burden is on the other person -- becomes on you when it wouldn't have been at first.
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2729.092" stopTime="2732.311">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    That shifting of the burden resulted in this case but --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2732.311" stopTime="2774.737">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that -- whatever it's resulted from, the result is that it resulted because of your law down there as I understand it which is as Mr. Justice Stewart read from the record. 
    But you have it, a situation where if this judgment ignored the lack of notice as I don't mind saying, I have -- instead of a belief, its probably is, the result is that the -- you didn't give him the same kind of trial he would've had gotten, same kind of it then take his trial had he been the defendant in the original case. 
    He couldn't get it that way because he became in effect the moving party in a new trial. 
    And we have to consider it that way, do we not?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2774.737" stopTime="2781.700">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Yes sir. 
    And of course, what we say is that he had a full and fair hearing satisfying the law.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2781.700" stopTime="2811.394">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say the full and fair hearing even though by reason of having him failed to give notice in the beginning. 
    Even though for that reason, the burden is shifted that he must do the attacking and do this -- have had the burden proof, isn't that a pretty big change? 
    I recall the many cases where I think probably, judges have convicted people because they didn't believe they were guilty beyond the reasonable doubt. 
    Here, there's a good deal of who has the burden of proof, isn't it?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2811.394" stopTime="2813.187">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    There's a good deal down in any case as to --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- curios, I noticed in Johnston, there was a jury trial in this issue but the nonjury trial here -- couldn't the petitioner have asked for a jury trial on this motion?

    Mr. William Duncan 
    We're strong on jury trials in Texas and --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Alright fine. 
    I'm all for it, I think --

    Mr. William Duncan

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, could he have had one if he asked for it?
speaker="william_duncan" startTime="2835.207" stopTime="2843.449">
    Mr. William Duncan 
    Under this procedure, I think that he could have because this was not a motion for a new trial. 
    This was not treated as a motion for a new trial.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I noticed in Johnston though, they picked up separate issues and --

    Mr. William Duncan 
    There's no question in my mind that if the parties had come in and said, "Your Honor, this is a subject, that's a question of fact". 
    In Texas the minute you say question of fact and I want a jury, you nearly got it made, --

    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    I might just say one or two things in conclusion, Your Honor. 
    He could not have had a jury, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    On this procedure, it's a motion for new trial, it's a procedural length --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2879.528" stopTime="2881.461">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it was in Johnston too as I read that opinion.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2881.461" stopTime="2884.977">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well we've got a confused situation there. 
    The legislature amended the law --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2884.977" stopTime="2885.956">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It's not important. 
    I just (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="ewell_lee_smith_jr" startTime="2885.956" stopTime="2922.475">
    Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr. 
    -- to allow those sayings. 
    I just want to say in closing that in May versus Anderson that the parent cannot be deprived on the precious right of custody without notice then a fortiori in this type of case. 
    I want to say under the rule of fairness as this Court set it out in the Mullane case, not even publication would have been sufficient here where the defendant, defendant's address was known. 
    He was -- went in the jurisdiction of the Court and where the party's concealed from him or at least conducted himself so he would receive no notice. 
    And I do want to say that Mr. Duncan was not counsel at that time.
