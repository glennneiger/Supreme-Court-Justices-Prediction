    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 43, Republic Steel Corporation, Petitioner, versus Charlie Maddox.

    Mr. Samuel H. Burr 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    This case comes here on petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    It presents one single but we feel a very important question of law involving industrial relations under the National Labor Relations Act. 
    That question is simply this that the person asserting a claim for severance pay based solely on the provisions of a collective bargaining contract governed by the Labor Management Relations Act as amended have to exhaust the binding grievance arbitration procedure provided for in the contract before he can sue in a court of law an effort to enforce his claim. 
    All of the Alabama courts below held that he was not required to exhaust these administrative or grievance and arbitration procedures. 
    We feel that this holding was fairly erroneous and contrary to the controlling federal substantive law enunciated by this Court since the Lincoln Mills decision. 
    At the outset I think it might be well for me to state that this is not a case like that in Humphrey versus Moore where the individual claimant might assert that he was unable to have a fair determination of his trial under the grievance and arbitration procedure because of some conflict -- conflicting interest on the part of his union or some connivance on the part of the union and the employer. 
    The complaint contains no allegation that the respondent ever requested his union to even invoke the arbitration and grievance procedure in this case. 
    It was -- it has been simply the respondent's position throughout this litigation that under the Alabama law that he was not required to resort to the grievance arbitration procedure before suing in Court. 
    The facts are relatively undisputed and in -- and as a matter of fact, they've quoted by stipulation of facts which we entered into in order to avoid the necessity of a lengthy trial so that this matter could be presented as a question of law and decided properly for the courts of Alabama. 
    First, I like to point out that the labor contract in this case was between the petitioner and the exclusive bargaining agent of the respondent and covered two mines located in Jefferson County, Alabama, Spaulding and Edwards mines. 
    It was in the usual form and was very comprehensive in nature, covering every phase of the employment relationship. 
    Petitioner was admittedly engaged in interstate commerce. 
    In that contract was Section 14 which set out a severance or separation pay provision. 
    This particular provision was of the conditional type. 
    That is a person was entitled a separation pay only upon a determination that the man or a substantial portion of the man, a plant where he worked was closed down permanently within the meaning of that particular contract. 
    He was not entitled to separation pay because of layoffs for economic reasons, automation or lack of hours or lack of business.

    If the suit were by the union, I believe it would -- is necessary for the union, the employee and the company alike to exhaust the grievance and arbitration procedure where the parties have agreed to put such a procedure which leads to binding arbitration in the contract itself. 
    I believe the union could bring a suit for a specific performance to make the employer handle the matter through the arbitration procedure.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="samuel_h_burr" startTime="337.594" stopTime="699.747">
    Mr. Samuel H. Burr 
    I agree with that statement. 
    I like to point out that the arbitration clause in this case is very broad. 
    It's in more or less the standard phraseology, it provides for the three grievance steps followed by binding arbitration. 
    There is -- there is even a provision that says in the interest of expeditious handling of a claim under this contract that the parties can agree on other types of procedure under the contract for the hearing of the grievance. 
    The scope of the arbitration provision is very broad covering any differences arising between the company and the union as to the interpretation or application of our compliance with the provisions of this agreement or as to any question relating to wages, hours of work, other conditions of employment of any employee. 
    A complaint of any employee -- any complaint of an employee is first attempted to be settled with his foreman, if it's not settled, then -- and that -- then it goes into the grievance steps. 
    I might also point out that there's no provision whatsoever as was true in the Independent Petroleum Workers case now pending before this Court which attempted to withdraw any particular appeal from the arbitration coverage. 
    That brings me to the facts of the layoff of this petition. 
    On December 16th, 1953, the respondent was laid off from active work, an enforced reduction. 
    At that time under the stipulation of facts, a dispute existed as to whether this layoff was due to a permanent closing of the mines or the portion of the mines where he worked. 
    As I said, the respondent made no effort whatsoever to exhaust the administrative grievance or grievance procedure. 
    Instead, he waited some two years and seven months after the time of his layoff and filed a suit in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County claiming severance pay. 
    When the case came on for trial, this Court had decided the Lincoln Mills case. 
    Other federal courts had intimated that this was a question of federal law that favored the enforceability of arbitration, provisions and labor contracts. 
    So, we defended the case on the grounds that the respondent had failed to invoke or to exhaust the grievance remedies. 
    In this connection I think it would be fair to point out that the respondent in his brief in this Court for the first time argues that the severance pay claim was not contemplated by the parties as being subject to the grievance procedure suggesting in support of this argument that the respondent could not have filed his claim within 30 days after the date of his layoff because of the absence of any foreman, a mine committeeman at the plant that he worked. 
    We must go outside of the record to answer that. 
    As a matter of actual fact, the mine committee was there. 
    The contract continued into operation for months after the plaintiff's layoff until this particular union was succeeded by a successor union, a new contract was negotiated with substantially the same grievance and arbitration procedure in the same severance pay procedure. 
    The trial court rejected our defense. 
    On appeal to the Court of Appeals of Alabama and while the case was pending there, this Court decided the Steelworkers trilogy in June of 1960. 
    We call these important cases to the attention of the Court of Appeals, our intermediate appellate court in Alabama. 
    Nevertheless, that court took the position based on two prior Alabama Supreme Court cases primarily, TCI versus Sizemore and Woodward Iron Company versus Stringfellow that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies. 
    Neither of these cases considered the import of the Lincoln Mills' holding that a new field of federal law was being fashioned which governed this matter. 
    Vaguely significant that the Sizemore case relied on by the Court of Appeals was based on the same common law rule developed in the commercial arbitration field that this Court deemed inconsistent with the congressional policy found in the Labor of Management Relations Act. 
    When the case reached the Alabama Supreme Court that Court felt constrained to recognize the existence of the federal law, in my opinion. 
    Nevertheless, it believed that under the federal law, it was still free to carve out from the general doctrine, favoring the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate in labor contracts. 
    Certain facts of claims like the severance pay claim in this case where the individual claimant was no longer employed actively by the company and where he was not seeking reinstatement. 
    This type of reasoning would cover the severance pay claims. 
    We think it would cover wrongful discharge claims. 
    It would cover claims for back pay brought by retired or resigned employees or terminated employees. 
    We feel that in making this distinction, the Supreme Court of Alabama first reached over in the Railway Labor field to take the decisions of this Court in Moore versus Illinois and TWA versus Koppal and apply that to the industrial field under the Labor Management Relations Act and then misconstrued the holdings of this Court to reach that result.

    But this case (Inaudible)
speaker="samuel_h_burr" startTime="725.299" stopTime="1117.146">
    Mr. Samuel H. Burr 
    No sir, it's not akin to the situation in Humphrey versus Moore whatsoever. 
    We feel that the true distinction and the touchstone for proper decision in this case is not the fortuitous status of the claimants employment relationship when he brings his suit, but is the determination of whether the contracting parties to the agreement upon which the claimant relies exclusively intended the subject matter of the claim to be within the scope of agreements and arbitration procedure. 
    We respectfully submit that this Court has virtually decided this case in the Lincoln Mills line of decisions under the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    First, it's certainly clear that there's now one uniform body of federal substantive law. 
    This point has been so well established in Lucas Flour and Smith versus Evening News. 
    In other decisions, it seems unnecessary to argue the point. 
    But it is interesting to me that these very decisions point out and emphasize the necessity of a uniformity of decisions that you obtain by using the proper grievance and arbitration procedure. 
    The Lucas Flour opinion for example points out the possibility that individual contract terms may have different meanings on a conflicting state and federal law. 
    It points out the desirability of adjusting claims under the agreed upon procedure as a part of collective bargaining itself. 
    Now, we can -- I believe anyone can readily visualize the disruptive results on the collective bargaining process. 
    If for example, various claimants similarly situated in claiming severance pay under the same labor contract and perhaps in state -- in different jurisdictions because these contracts cover more than one state very often, are allowed to bring different suits before different courts, different juries. 
    I think it's obvious that this would have a very disruptive and disadvantage -- disadvantageous effect on the collective bargaining contracts. 
    It would certainly in our opinion discourage employers who are willing now to include severance pay and separation pay provision in their contract if the employers are going to be denied the right to have matters involving those provisions determined under the agreed upon -- by the agreed upon tribunal as a result of conflicting state law. 
    The decisions under the one body of uniform federal law decided by this Court certainly favor the full enforceability of coll -- of arbitration provisions. 
    This -- the basic foundation for this principle is found in Section 203 (d) of the Act itself which provides that the final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is determined desirable under the Act. 
    The Steelworkers trilogy has set out definitely that this is proper under the federal scheme of things and they say that you should not exclude as we read those decisions from the coverage of the arbitration provision, any matter involving the contract unless positive assurance can be found that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation covering the asserted dispute. 
    The broad scope of this doctrine has been enunciated further in the Drake case, in the Needham case, in John Wiley versus Livingston case whereas a matter of fact the Court mentioned that typically included in collective bargaining agreements or such matters as seniority status and severance pay, the very type of claim in this case. 
    Here again, the unanimous opinion of this Court said that the matter was going by federal law, not conflicting state law. 
    It emphasized again the central and primary role of the arbitration process. 
    It mentioned that the agreement covered the entire employment relation and stated that an employer would have to arbitrate under an expired contract as I remember the case where the plant involved had been closed down after a consolidation of merger or merger of the employer involved by another company. 
    We believe very strongly that all of the reasons set out in those cases favoring the arbitration, the full enforceability of the arbitration process fully apply to a severance pay claim, the desirability of uniform results, the ex -- the expertise available under the arbitration process, the statutory right of the union to participate properly in the adjustment of grievances, and a prompt and expeditious disposition of these claims. 
    Incidentally, the contract itself provided for appropriate time limits for the filing of agreements and between the grievance steps. 
    The severance pay claim by nature we believe is particularly suited to be held under the arbitration machinery. 
    For instance, one of those items that is subject to good faith bargaining like any other condition of employment, it is solely a breach of contract. 
    It's like any other monetary claim based on the contract. 
    In essence, it is just a form of deferred payment paid to an employee in return for work performed under the contract. 
    It is specifically set out in the contract and one clause at Section 14, the severance pay and Section 10 is the arbitration provision. 
    Certainly, the party has intended that this matter be determined under the agreed upon tribunal.

    Mr. Samuel H. Burr 
    We can only assume this Mr. Justice White. 
    The grievance in this case was a grievance committeeman who had participated in a previous arbitration involving the same subject matter which related to a previous layoff of the underground portion of the mine and the arbitrator in that case Mr. (Inaudible) Washington determined that the employees involved were not entitled to severance pay because it was not a -- that the employment was not terminated within the meaning of the Section 14. 
    And no, there's nothing in the record that intimates why the claimant in this case did not attempt to exhaust the administrative remedies.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1206.216" stopTime="1207.481">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or the union?
speaker="samuel_h_burr" startTime="1207.481" stopTime="1705.509">
    Mr. Samuel H. Burr 
    Or the union, yes sir. 
    We feel certainly that the obligation to exhaust the administrative remedies applies to the employee as well as to the union and the employer. 
    We feel in the interest of a fair policy under the uniform federal law arbitration must work both ways. 
    It cannot be a one way street. 
    If it is favored by public policy when one party demands it then at the same time, we believe that is -- that the same public policy favors it and that the employer in this case can defend on a basis that the grievance with machinery has not been followed. 
    We believe actually the Court has recognized this by a footnote to the decision of Smith versus Evening News which it mentioned in upholding the concurrent jurisdictions to entertain a 301 type suit that in the case in Smith there was no grievance arbitration procedure on the contract which had to be exhausted before result could be had to the courts. 
    And following the import of the Supreme Court cases from Lincoln Mills through the trilogy to Drake, the Second Circuit for example has held that former employees could not bring suit for wrongful discharge and a suit governed by the Labor Management Relations Act without seeking to obtain redressed through the grievance arbitration procedure. 
    The same result has been followed, had been reached by the Fourth Circuit in Henderson versus Eastern Gas and Fuel Company cited in our brief. 
    We believe those decisions to be proper. 
    This brings me to my final thought of my argument which relates to the Railway Labor Act cases upon which we feel the Supreme Court of Alabama erroneously relied. 
    First place, we believe an excellent argument could now be made at the holdings in Moore versus Illinois Central and TWA versus Koppal which were writs and cases where a federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship have now been perhaps overruled although it's not necessary to reach that point in this case at least we believe in the proper case, those cases will have to be reexamined. 
    The result seems implicit in the recent decision of this Court in IAM versus Central Airlines, an action arising under the laws of the United States in which it was held that federal and not state law controls in connection with matters involving the enforcement and interpretation of collective bargaining contracts. 
    It's interesting to know that the Court there cited the Lucas Flour case decided under the Labor Management Relations Act on the point that the subject matter manifestly call for uniformity. 
    Certainly, the Moore doctrine should be examined -- it should be reexamined and certainly, we feel that the -- that a divergence of results bearing from state to state previously true at least under the Railway Labor Act is completely inconsistent with the policy of this Court established under the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    Just for example, the Second Court -- the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in two cases has declined to follow the Moore doctrine in a wrongful discharge cases even under the Railway Labor Act, the Larsen case and the Satterfield cases cited in our brief. 
    The first of which cited the National Labor Policy developed under the Labor Management Relations Act in recent years and the second relying on the later decision of this Court in Pennsylvania Railroad versus Day. 
    In addition, they -- both in decision in Mississippi which involved the same law interpreted in Moore versus Illinois as refused to follow at this date, Moore versus -- the doctrine of Moore versus Illinois in view of the later decisions of this Court. 
    On the other hand, just last Thursday, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in McDonald versus the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad did follow Moore versus Illinois but said that in -- that instance Moore versus Illinois should be limited specifically to the cause of action there presented a wrongful discharge case. 
    And I think the theory there was it perhaps in a wrongful discharge case that the claimant may have other items of injury or other items of damage which he cannot find for redress or on the arbitration procedure. 
    Certainly, this is not true here. 
    Under the arbitration procedure, if the plaintiff is entitled to severance pay, it's spelled out exactly what he gets. 
    There is no other thing like damages for lawsuit, seniority rights, insurance, or pension rights. 
    Finally, in Pennsylvania Railroad versus Day the Court here has severely restricted the application of Moore versus Illinois to the unusual and specific situation of wrongful discharge. 
    In the Slocum Enterprise cases the Court has justified the continued existence of the Moore doctrine on the basis of the special nature of a common law or statutory right for wrongful discharge. 
    As I've said, feeling that perhaps in those cases, there might be a different type of remedy and a different type of damages not available under the administrative process. 
    This is certainly not true in the instant case. 
    Also, I think it's interesting to point out that in the instant case, the decision of the arbitrator is found and binding on all parties and I think the Moore versus Illinois Central doctrine may have been influenced by the beating of the Court that a decision of the National Railroad Adjustment Board was not binding and so far as the money award was concerned on the railroad. 
    And so, they said it's not unfair to say that the employee can go to court. 
    As a matter of fact, the Central Airline case which involved the question of a system board award which was found then binding is more analogous to the instant situation. 
    In any event, we respectively submit that there's no need to expand this doctrine which is already severely limited in its own field to the Labor Management Relations Act field and particularly in view of the clear cases in -- favoring the full enforceability of arbitration provisions. 
    The conclusion, I just like to point out that we feel that the Supreme Court of Alabama fell into error because it had a too narrow concept of the entire collective bargaining process. 
    It did not consider the role of arbitration as an essential part of the entire collective bargaining process. 
    We feel that the plaintiff here in this case has attempted to obtain the benefits of the contract while rejecting the burdens of the contract. 
    And as Justice Brandeis said in one of the earliest cases involving the arbitration field where parties have agreed on arbitration, I think this was the Red Cross case that the substantive right of the parties to have that matter arbitrated, the disputes under that contract arbitrated is a perfect obligation. 
    If the policy of the law governing the contract favors that right, we feel the intent of the parties should be followed.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Let me use the question asked by Justice White as the springboard for what I have to say and let me say it parenthetically this first talk. 
    We represent Charlie Maddox. 
    I'll make that clear for this reason. 
    We do -- we're not here representing the union, in fact the union has appeared here, amicus curiae with the petition and I said kiddingly to my associate as we drove up that if this --

    Well, I've had a little (Inaudible)

    Right.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="richard_l_jones" startTime="1955.170" stopTime="2218.911">
    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    Right. 
    I said, kidding unless rubs on the way up that if this was a 301 case, it wouldn't have to fall, we never heard of 301 when we filed this lawsuit sitting there in our office trying to -- obtained delayed birth certificates and released garnishment. 
    We just hadn't gotten into the labor field very much but we are available to people who walk in our door, house and that's what happened in this case. 
    We represent this individual. 
    We brought him to some seduction, suit on contract. 
    He said in the contract that if they'd laid him off, they'd pay him severance pay. 
    They laid him off and didn't pay him severance pay. 
    Two years have gone by. 
    He lost his seniority rights and couldn't get rehired. 
    He sued on the contract for his money -- for his money. 
    There's an anomaly involved here. 
    You got a lot of -- you've got a lot of cases coming up here from Alabama. 
    But let me say this, this is different. 
    This is not one of those cases where you go appeal some impelling reasons to set them straight by something in my opinion. 
    I think here for once, it would be terribly ironic but if you decide they were wrong because this is the -- before reaching this is that progressive type of decision as opposed to those that you have reviewed so many times and rightly so. 
    Here you have the State of Alabama say in this Court, the Supreme Court of Alabama saying that here is a public policy which we will enforce as a matter of state law that leaves the courthouse door open to this man to go in and sue for a severance pay. 
    Now, that's a pretty good decision, not a pretty good law. 
    And let's boil this thing down to its essentials or saying what is the issue here? 
    What are we talking about? 
    The -- in further answer to Justice White's question, the people who brought this action, who brought this grievance holding up for a 30-day limit was waived not -- I don't know. 
    I don't know about those folks. 
    But I do know this, at the instant, if you would ask him the further question, how did they come out? 
    Nonetheless though, I'm not trying to get beyond the record. 
    Let's talk about the inevitable situation as preempted. 
    Let's talk about the inherency of the dangers involved. 
    He's got a right for reemployment under this contract within two years. 
    Does he want severance paid? 
    Does he want his $694 or does he want to work? 
    He's never done anything in his life but go in this mine and work at the mine. 
    And that was in 30 days, he had burdened with the decision of deciding whether he wants to get $694 or whether he wants to wait out another job. 
    Now that's some decisions to put on immediately. 
    Statute of limitations in Alabama with contract six years, why? 
    Why such a long period? 
    I remember six years as opposed to 30 days under this, because the very breach of the contract is in a nebulous area. 
    Has it been breached? 
    When he got back there that next morning, there one -- there was no sign written up over that mine door that says this mine is permanently closed by decision of -- by the decision of the Republic State. 
    He didn't find that. 
    In fact, they told him what? 
    And defended on it and defended on both the arbitrator many months later. 
    They hadn't told it yet. 
    Now what are his rights? 
    He can't win for losing. 
    He hadn't got a foreman. 
    The mine closed, no foreman, no fellow employees, 30 days now to make his complaint. 
    If that complaint made within 30 days is not satisfied, then he goes to the first step of grievance with fellow employees. 
    What fellow employees? 
    The mine is closed. 
    Does any wonder that there might be some slim area of liberality even in the Alabama courts that respect this whole situation?

    I want to put it this way so as to not appear on the negative on the defensive in this case. 
    I -- we do not come here in any defensive situation. 
    We feel that we don't. 
    Here's what we're talking about. 
    All claims was the word on that, does all claims based on the collective bargaining agreement come within that orbit to be governed by federal substantive law, all of them. 
    Or to put another way this federal substantive law govern all claims arising out of the labor management contract. 
    I think that's a blunt -- simple way to put the question. 
    Now if they do not, then this one surely must follow without that orbit. 
    And let's take a look at what we mean by orbit and perhaps to illustrate some other fact situation might help. 
    A question was asked a moment ago by Justice White with respect to personal injuries or negligence. 
    Now, you may remember that in some states even where workers' compensation covers accidental injury, if you've got an injury without an accident, long exposure situations that you can't have an action either negligence or for breach of contract. 
    Suppose for a moment that an employee sued on a health and safety provisions of a union contract for personal injury. 
    Is that the type that would be arbitrable on the 301?

    That is the exemption, not the general rule. 
    You see, go back to Erie Railroad and pick up and come (Inaudible). 
    How do we get federal substantive law in the first place? 
    By a public policy that cry out in this whole labor management relationship. 
    These disruptive factors in labor management that brought about Taft-Hartley or where in you say -- or Taft-Hartley was just brought about but in that atmosphere it was -- it -- that it was which pronounced an arbitration policy. 
    A section says there that it -- were effectively given to that agreement to arbitrate. 
    Now, this is -- it is from this that the Court has said it is from the implication of this Federal Act that we're going to create this body of federal substantive law to apply to those situations dealt with specifically by Taft-Hartley. 
    Smith versus Evening News, we do not consider that all claims by individuals are outside the orbit of 301.

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    Suppose somebody came to this Court by some procedure, I haven't thought this through, know how to get here but so supposing was here, saying that we made contracts up in Chicago and deal with the various states. 
    I guess you have to have a Congressional Act involved first that unified the law. 
    Well, a good one interstate commerce and a truck, trucks going into various states. 
    This Court had just said we will not create a body of federal substantive law that says the rules to the road in Mississippi and Alabama are going to be the same because interstate commerce is involved, just having said that. 
    And you -- and when you started off at the Westinghouse case, keep this in mind now. 
    When you started off the Westinghouse case there were some serious question upon -- about the presently constituted courts as to the constitutionality of this thing about arbitration. 
    But you resolved it in favor of the constitutionality. 
    But you watched it, you looked at it and workout and said, "We've got watch it this close". 
    And because if we get beyond what Congress was intending to do in Taft-Hartley we're going beyond the constitutionality, in other words interpreted to favor the constitutionality as opposed to the unconstitutionality of that. 
    Then you came along later and said that -- and overruled Westinghouse in the Smith versus Evening News.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3048.853" stopTime="3066.249">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So if a -- if the employer just came around because I'm terminating you and he says, “Well, you don't have any right to terminate me but I'll be terminated" -- I mean, if he takes severance pay then -- anytime that determination is what you're saying.

    That's what the -- that's what's the railroad cases has gone of or completed. 
    Now the railroad case as they say sets up some different policy about this. 
    I mean you permit from the suing state court and that state court governing the railroad cases, but we don't want to do it here because there are some different congressional policy. 
    Well how can that possibly be? 
    The labor -- the Railroad Labor Act even established the very board for the arbitration. 
    What could be more in keeping with the federal and -- federally announced public policy to arbitrate than to establish the board from the arbitrated being?

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    No sir, no sir. 
    That their case probably answers that, although I think that the dissent was very brilliantly done in that case. 
    But the Day case does -- that does not stand in the way of my proposition. 
    But it does say that if it would have that disruptive effect on presently employed employees, then we will also say that comes within the orbit of the arbitrable claims as opposed to lawsuits. 
    Now, here's the final point I want to make, both sides here that is the company and the AFL-CIO in the amicus brief. 
    They are -- they -- I could say they contend, that would be a bad choice of words. 
    They assume that the federal law if applied in this case is already established and has already been announced and therefore the Supreme Court of Alabama decision will be overruled. 
    Now, I'll take this strong issue with that. 
    I think that's not so at all because to say that that's true is to say this, that you're going to create and have -- already began that process of creating two completely line of cases they will reach completely different results, one in the railroad cases on the one hand and the other, the 301 of the LMRA on the other. 
    I don't think you've done that at all. 
    In fact, the more recent cases have drawn in parallel and taken language from one and applied in the other.

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    Well, I think it's talking about the same public policy about -- I think he's talking about the public policy of arbitration. 
    But in that case whether that had arisen under railroad labor or LMRA, I think your results would have been the same. 
    That's what I think it has to do with. 
    I don't see two distinct lines of cases grow or growing out of this.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3368.095" stopTime="3370.953">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Not on the -- you mean not on the applicability of federal law?

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3372.314" stopTime="3377.373">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought that's what you said in the -- with the -- was different between the two lines of cases.
speaker="richard_l_jones" startTime="3377.373" stopTime="3404.866">
    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    Because I don't think there's going to be any difference. 
    I think your decision is going to be the same because I think the public policy announced in the Railroad Labor Act is the same policy announced under LMRA. 
    I don't see any difference. 
    So that I think that the line of cases which you've already established the right of an employee who has gotten completely away from, and not part of the machinery of management labor relationship.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3404.866" stopTime="3410.753">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="richard_l_jones" startTime="3410.753" stopTime="3411.816">
    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    And I don't think there are.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3411.816" stopTime="3414.126">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We would create one if we decided to get through here.
speaker="richard_l_jones" startTime="3414.126" stopTime="3530.617">
    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    That's right. 
    Yes sir. 
    You would create a completely new one, not have -- not already created and not bear within these other case. 
    Where you have enforced arbitration is where you would have been dealing specifically and directly with that disruptive element in management labor, that's where you said you got to arbitrate because of -- Taft-Hartley says so, if the parties agreed to. 
    Only one confusing case in this whole line that I see, this has been very intriguing but interesting to take these cases, we're not dealing with them as I don't and follow the consistency and the line of reasoning that has brought us up to this point, most intriguing. 
    Only one case bothered me some, and I think perhaps just because I don't understand something in the record. 
    Justice Black dissents in Lucas Flour and says if there was no agreement to arbitrate and yet the majority goes off on the assumption that there was. 
    That one is – that throws me a little bit on that one feature. 
    Outside of that, it is the -- their thinking has been clear, it has responded to this public outcry of a public policy to keep down confusion and conflict to this disruptive effect and management labor. 
    And you've done that under the policy announced by LMRA. 
    By the same token you said if that's not involved and it doesn't come within the scope and the orbit and field of operation of Taft-Hartley, just like it didn't come within the wrongful discharge, didn't come within railroad labor. 
    Then we leave him either one or two ways. 
    And here, remember that -- I don't mean that I'm disinterested or made in that sense, but I don't stand in the position of the company who has to deal with this tomorrow and the next day and so forth or the position of the union who must do it, I stand here with this one --

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    Only if he accepts -- only if he accepts and that's the distinction on one of the cases that he mentions. 
    Only if he accepts his discharge as filed, so as he is not suing for reemployment rights. 
    So, you said that -- that's the difference in Moore and Slocum.

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    He can go to court. 
    And can do so under two theory -- one of two theories, either ones are (Inaudible). 
    That Taft-Hartley just doesn't reach this and there is no federal body of substantive law which applies. 
    Or yes Taft-Hartkey does but just as we've done in the railroad cases, we state what that public policy is and it's the same as Alabama State. 
    In other words, to say that federal substantive law applies, it's not to say that Charlie Maddox loses his lawsuit because in the railroad case, as you've already said, that we'll announce a public policy. 
    And that part of the policy is that if -- that the doors of the courthouse are open and he don't have the right to sue and go into court and make use of that guarantee of the constitution to be useful.

    And you have to rely on the collective bargaining agreement as (Inaudible) your right to severance pay.

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    That's right, that's right.

    Your source is in that collective contract.

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    That is true.

    That isn't part of that issue here --

    Mr. Richard L. Jones 
    That's right.

    But we would look back and say what within the labor contract was Taft-Hartley dealing with? 
    What were they talking about? 
    What was the concern of Congress over those matters that had nothing to do with the disruptive effect and the peace within the industry?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, on that ground you say it's no (Inaudible)

    And if it does, if it does, it would still be a policy consistent without announcing the railroad cases which would permit him to sue.

    If he wants it that way, and I've got a selfish interest involved in that because I won't -- my right to sit and (Inaudible) walk in my door for me to represent him if he so chooses to do so. 
    Thank you.
