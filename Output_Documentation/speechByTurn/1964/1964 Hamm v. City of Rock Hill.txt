Hamm v. City of Rock Hill

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
    A petitioner, Arthur Hamm Jr. was convicted of what the record calls “trespass” in the Recorder's Court of the City of Rock Hill, South Carolina and was sentenced to a hundred dollar fine or 30 days in jail on a record which he stipulated would cover him but which in fact was the record of the Reverend Ivory who was a cripple, who was in a wheelchair that Mr. Hamm was pushing the time of the events in question. 
    Pending appeal, Reverend Ivory died and this case continues only in connection with Mr. Hamm. 
    Generally speaking, the sit-in demonstration in which he engaged was a typical one quite like the scores of cases that have been brought to this Court and the perhaps 3000 cases that are now pending in state, trial and appellate courts, many awaiting the outcome of cases in this Court.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes I would, providing that the facts were something that are covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    In other words, I would look at essentially what occurred not the type of reprising that was used against it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="228.185" stopTime="235.161">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Many of these cases wouldn't -- the record wouldn't show whether or not they were covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would they?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="235.161" stopTime="279.935">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, perhaps not, but it think these record show and I would imagine that if the record tells anything at all about what happened there would be enough evidence to show that the facility is covered. 
    As I will argue, if I have time, if a place is open to the public without any restriction, without any restriction against interstate travelers, in other words if its anything unlike the restaurants they had for a brief period of time after (Inaudible) and that said intrastate travelers only. 
    We would submit open to the public includes intrastate travelers and it's under the Act, and I think the legislative history supports that. 
    I think the plain language supports that. 
    So if there is evidence that this is a food establishment open to the public, we would submit and strongly urge that it's covered.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="279.935" stopTime="286.406">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That may very well be an arguable position but it's a much broader -- more extreme position than that taken by the Solicitor General last week as you realized.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, I don't think the Solicitor General faced that particular issue. 
    He was in a case on pleadings and on a record in which essentially the question of substantiality of food service was being mooted, but I don't know, that he would --

    I don't know what he would do --

    My argument is that as in this record there was a great deal of questioning of the manager of McCrory's which is an interstate chain that -- sixth largest chain in the country, sells 3000 items in the store as well, as the lunch counter. 
    He said that he admitted Chinese and other Orientals and Indians and communists and in other words there was no restriction whatsoever as to the public and they offered to serve --

    That's true also, the (Inaudible) record, isn't it?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="381.476" stopTime="382.552">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="382.552" stopTime="386.423">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And your answer is that you don't need that in order to bring it within the Civil Rights Act?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="386.423" stopTime="457.777">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That's correct. 
    The legislative history of the Act shows that at one point a substantiality provision was offered and the substantiality amendment was defeated. 
    And Congressman Seller in speaking -- in opposition to the substantiality amendment argued that if this were incorporated into the Act, the Act would then not cover all establishments. 
    That's the word he said. 
    I can refer you to the page of the congressional record, and would not have the same coverage as the Acts of 30 states and the District of Columbia, I think. 
    Anything else would be an anomalous result because if an interstate traveler is supposed to be protected, he would then have to stop in front of an establishment unless he were affirmatively asked not to come in and have so much conduct pretrial discovery of dimensions you might have an antitrust case. 
    However, if a restaurant keeper wanted to so structure his business as to keep Negroes out, the Act does permit such an eccentric person with some difficulty to setup such a restaurant and running. 
    There are food fad restaurants, vegetarian restaurants, the persons who have peculiar diets for reasons of health or reasons of religion and they all --

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    It is not an argument appealing to judicial notice. 
    It is an argument based upon the terms of the statute, the statute by its language and by its intent and legislative history and by any sense of what a reasonable administration of such a law would be necessarily covers every place, except a place which a man has gone to some trouble to so structure in a way to exclude Negroes. 
    And that would be possible but it would be difficult.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Oh, I would prefer not to use the word retroactive Mr. Justice Harlan, it can be phrased in that way. 
    The punishment, if it is to occur will occur in the future the entire abatement doctrine of United States against Chambers and suggested by Mr. Justice Brennan the Bell case really says that the courts will decide the case on the basis of the law as it now stands. 
    And we would say that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in its matter of statutory interpretation, the common law of federal statutory interpretation and in a certain constitutional dimension removes from the states any power to continue with these proceedings. 
    I will argue that.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="537.524" stopTime="558.179">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Inaudible) you said to a certain extent a constitutional argument. 
    How could it be other than a constitutional argument to say that Congress has power to abate cases which were perfectly constitutionally started for the Act if he has power abate them?Why does not -- to have raised a constitutional question?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="558.179" stopTime="669.182">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, it does. 
    What I had intended to say was I was analogizing in -- on that part of my argument, this case, the United States against Chambers. 
    And the Chambers case was a case in which the passage of the repeal amendment caused the abatement of prosecutions that were perfectly valid under a statute that existed at the time that those prosecutions were commenced. 
    In fact the statute itself I don't believe was repealed. 
    It was the constitutional amendment that removed the authority. 
    Now, our argument is that since the formation of this republic, the Congress has had an extremely wide authority over the area of interstate commerce, and well-phrased in various ways in terms of congressional intent or congressional silence or in terms of other formulations, states have exercised power over such commerce and activities which affect such commerce. 
    This always has been at the sufferance of the Congress. 
    When the Congress acted at this time to take this matter in hand, it had in effect of constitutional dimension comparable to the effect of the repeal of the prohibition amendment. 
    And we make the same argument in connection with the implementation of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment that the Congress has now drawn certain lines. 
    It has made certain definitions to which I would definitely view referred in your opinion in the Bell case Mr. Justice Black as one of the reasons why you thought the Fourteenth Amendment then did not apply. 
    But Congress has now made certain definitions which were found objectionable and -- of the lack of which were found objectionable in that opinion and so now, the Fourteenth Amendment has taken hold of this area. 
    And these are two expressions of Congress in an area of constitutional competence in which Congress can completely override the will of the states.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="669.182" stopTime="673.533">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) taken hold in these cases, the Commerce Clause has taken hold.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="673.533" stopTime="724.368">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, I would submit the Fourteenth Amendment applies here too. 
    Section 201 (d) (2) of the Act applies to state action and it defines state action in a way that is precisely what occurred in this case. 
    If I may read it, “State action is -- refers to discrimination or segregation. 
    If such discrimination or segregation is carried on under color of any custom or usage required or enforced by officials of the state”. 
    Now, the record is replete here. 
    This was a custom of segregation. 
    This custom of segregation was being enforced by officials of the state, they were arresting the man. 
    It was not the kind of state action for example that is -- of which might call of more elementary sort that appears in Section 202. 
    And so that Congress has spoken to that. 
    Again there's some legislative history on this point.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I think that it's entirely possible that the statute did not go to the full extent of the Section 5 powers, but nevertheless the statute went to the extent covered here. 
    The statute covers costumer usage enforced by state officials and I would say that is by arrest and conviction in this case. 
    I think quite possibly while Congress can state certain minimums, the Fourteenth Amendment in fact very well might go beyond this and this Court has declared and defined the Fourteenth Amendment frequently without particular congressional legislation.

    Addition, I would like at the outset to briefly set forth the sum of the theories on which he relies and some of the facts. 
    They went in to the store and Reverend Ivory made some purchases and then they went to the lunch counter, and they were asked by the manager to leave the lunch counter. 
    One of our arguments which I don't believe I'll have time to present orally set forth at length in our brief is the man -- that the manager never did asked him to leave the premises. 
    The warrant speaks in terms of leaving the counter. 
    The statute, however speaks in terms of leaving the premises. 
    I think this is an important point because they were welcome on the premises. 
    They bought various items on the premises and they were later told they could go to a checkout counter and get a refund for the matters they bought on the premises. 
    However, they never were actually asked to leave the premises except by a police officer later on.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Didn't say anything about trespass statute one way or the other?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1310.467" stopTime="1336.847">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    No, there was nothing said about trespass statutes one way or the other. 
    Our primary argument is that this case falls within the -- by virtue of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 falls within the rule of abatement which was described in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in Bell against Maryland. 
    These were a federal conviction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would supplant it, I don't think there's any doubt about that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1336.847" stopTime="1339.117">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about -- it couldn't be a federal conviction.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1339.117" stopTime="1404.887">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, it could've occurred in the District of Columbia and the Thompson case might never been decided. 
    I'm -- if a state statute had been passed in South Carolina that statute would supplant the state conviction, because South Carolina retains the ancient rule and so concedes in its brief. 
    Well, we argue that this case is a fortiori that federal law being supreme and Congress having exercised power and authority under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment, both of which authorize the national government to displace state authority. 
    The federal statute is to be read as abating the state conviction just as it would obliterate a state conviction on these facts were they to occur tomorrow. 
    Now, Section 203 (c) of the Act, the punishment section says you can't convict some if this were to occur today or tomorrow. 
    So you can't convict somebody under this set of fact. 
    And in addition to the plain language, Senator Humphrey was quite clear on the statement on the floor that appears on page 22 of our brief that you can't convict somebody for trespass. 
    I think he maybe even spoken about that now that the Civil Rights Act has been passed.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That -- certainly not. 
    I hope that my -- I can quite clarify that. 
    Now the rule of abatement, we submit, is part of the common law federal statutory interpretation, but it's powerfully reinforced by other considerations. 
    The rationale behind the common law rule was stated by Chief Justice Hues, in Chambers against -- United States v. Chambers when he referred to the common law doctrine as standing for the proposition that when the reason for the rule vanishes, the rule must go as well. 
    And in this case, we submit, that he reason for the rule has been undermined with the most emphatic manner imaginable. 
    Not only has what once was a crime been made a defense to a charge of crime, but the citizen's right to demand service on a basis of equality has been substituted with the storeowners asserted right to discriminate. 
    Moreover, that asserted right to discriminate rested in part upon certain policy considerations which now have little or no weight. 
    One justification of the state's power to arrest then convict a sit-in demonstrator in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment has been that the Negro would-be patron has not demonstrated that he is entitled to service. 
    He merely sat there demanding service and not getting it in the kind of impasse. 
    But that impasse no longer remains. 
    He's entitled to service now. 
    Justification has also been offered to the effect that proprietor has a certain expectancy in his properties, how he may employ it, perhaps some degree of privacy and so forth. 
    But he no longer can refuse service. 
    He doesn't have that expectancy any longer. 
    He knows he has to serve. 
    Another justification has been that this would lead to affrays and the use of self-help and so forth, but it would be now totally illegal for a proprietor to do self-help, to throw a Negro out in the light of the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, I confess that I don't know what the law on that is, but it -- the way it strikes me is I would think he ought not to be able to that he reach a situation that as if I come home to my house, I don't know that if somebody is standing there I imagine I ought to go and get a policeman or do something to get into it, but I don't know.

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1593.075" stopTime="1595.213">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1598.233" stopTime="1746.076">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    He would have to resort to the Act. 
    So the reason for the rule on which the judgments of conviction rest is not only fallen but some of the principle policy arguments supporting an arrest and conviction in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment also a form. 
    But more than that as it worked here. 
    I've referred to the common law of abatement but everyone recognizes that the legislature may qualify, this with a savings provision. 
    The thrust of the general rule however is that the burden is very much upon the legislature to make such savings explicit. 
    And in criminal cases, the further thrust of our jurisprudence is that at least reasonable doubts will be resolved in favor of defendants. 
    The argument may be made that because we have an asserted divestment of state authority by federal law, the delicacy of the Federal State Relationship Council's caution in reaching the conclusion that the 1964 Act restrains the continued prosecution of those whose offenses predate the Act. 
    But the real question is whether following enactment of the 1964 Act, any state constitutionally retains power to persist in regulating through continued prosecution and punishment the behavior which had been taken under direct federal control by the federal act. 
    We submit the federal act strip the states of such power. 
    In answer to questions earlier, I stated our position on this point, and that is that the action of the Congress under the Commerce Clause with respect to a power that the states have exercised only because Congress over the years has permitted them either by intention or sovereign or otherwise they exercise it, is now such a paramount exercise of federal power that the states have had authority taken from them in this just as the Congress had authority taken from it by the passage of the repeal amendment. 
    Now, Congress could have narrowed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by expressed limitation for the limited purpose of letting states impose punishment in cases like this. 
    It could've affected such a limitation just s Chief -- Justice Hughes pointed out in the Chambers case it could've done in connection with the prohibition amendment, but Congress didn't do this. 
    It may be that Congress' failure to enact the savings clause, the matter occurred to anyone, a legislative history does not indicate it was discussed.

    I don't know, Mr. Justice Black, I would imagine that to the extent that they rested upon any federal authority which was divested by the passage of repeal they -- to the extent they rested on that, they would've fallen also, but I don't have any idea. 
    I'm not aware that there are such cases.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1773.187" stopTime="1779.990">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the fact is that that repealing amendment was a very, very specific in preserving a tremendous autonomy in --
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1779.990" stopTime="1780.203">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    In (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1780.203" stopTime="1781.554">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible) states.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1781.554" stopTime="2034.389">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That's quite right and states have -- but we submit there's even more than the constitutional consideration than the -- what we call the common law federal statutory interpretation. 
    Congress has enacted a savings clause, Section 109 of Title 1, and what that savings clause deals with, and it's been on the books for a long time is perhaps quite indicative of what Congress did not intend to deal with. 
    Of course there've been cases in connection with 109 over the years. 
    Now, Section 109 which is the federal savings clause does not apply to this case. 
    First of all Section 109 applies only to state -- or I'm sorry, is only federal statute, does not apply to state statute. 
    Secondly, Section 109 deals only with repeals, and in the Chambers case and in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in Bell against Maryland demonstrate that what has occurred here is not a repeal but something else, something which may be characterized as substitution of a right for a crime. 
    Finally, Section 109 allows for exceptions even for those statutes which have been repealed, assuming that you wanted to call this a repealer. 
    And Section 203 (c) would be such an exception even if this could be called a repeal and even if it did apply to state judgments. 
    Section 203 (c) provides that no person shall punish any person for exercising any right or privilege secured by Section 201 or 202. 
    And we have an argument in our brief that is -- there's no point in going over here, but they're canvassing the various dictionaries and so forth the meaning of the word secure. 
    The legislative history indicates the word right was not used in the strictly jural sense, even though they're obviously were Fourteenth Amendment rights covered by the Act now that were covered earlier so -- but it was used in some certain morals and since that legislative history is set forth at length in our brief. 
    So if you view it, 109 is applying to state judgments and you view this as a repeal, Section 203 is an explicit exception. 
    But we think Section 203 (c) has even more force than that, because if there's going to be a punishment there's no problem of retroactivity that punishment is going to occur in the future. 
    And Section 203 (c), even if we fall into the use of the words perspective and retroactive, is applying to something that's going to happen prospectively. 
    It says no one shall be punished for exercising rights. 
    These rights sometimes are legal, sometimes are moral, even predating the Act. 
    And we would submit that 203 (c) would cover the situation. 
    Now, even if our argument that the federal act wipes this all out doesn't apply, the federal statute is the law of South Carolina just as any federal treaty is the law of the state, constitution as the law of the state. 
    Cases of this Court (Inaudible) Hallenstein v. Lyman (ph), and other cases have made this abundantly clear. 
    The law of South Carolina, we've argued and this conceded in the brief for the State of South Carolina is that if this were South Carolina public accommodation statute, it would have to abate under South Carolina law. 
    Except that South Carolina has an argument that, I trust this Court will not accept, and that is that even were this incident to occur today these petitioners could be prosecuted for trespass. 
    South Carolina argues that if they're told they can't be served, they have to go out and file an action for an injunction, if they don't, they're trespassers. 
    Well, I think that was made quite clear in the Boynton case and Peterson and Lombard case that someone who is sitting there demanding service against a situation where the Fourteenth Amendment is being violated is not a trespasser. 
    It can't be convicted for trespass, legislative history can --

    The intent of the legislative history of the Act that he wouldn't be and consequently under the South Carolina jurisprudence, the conviction must abate and if South Carolina refuses to follow the federal law in the case, we would follow at state law, this is a discrimination against the federal law and there are cases which indicate that that judgment would have to fall.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I would like to say, first of all, of course it could and there could be done a variety of ways probably by hearing on this very question. 
    But I would urge most strongly that that not be done, because if a Negro traveler is to get off the train in Saint Louis and have an hour between trains and then have to go into town and wonder whether or not what is going on inside the mind of the proprietor in the drugstore, the Act will become completely inadministrable. 
    If somebody wants to affirmatively keep Negroes out off his restaurant, the Act gives him a way to do it if he wants to go to a sufficient amount of trouble to do it. 
    But a place which offers to serve and that there is no substantiality requirement, when Congress meant substantiality it said it in the third category, substantial amount of food. 
    There was a substantiality amendment and it was rejected, it was proffered and then it was rejected that a place which affirmatively, especially a large national chain like McCrory's but any place which offers to serve the public affirmatively. 
    There's no negative -- that's not -- nothing negative, the public includes lesser categories of the public and in this nation with all the travel that we have and all the moving around it covers everybody. 
    Congressman Seller, a number of times, in rejecting the substantiality amendment said that if this were accepted we wouldn't cover all stores. 
    Because its --

    Well, the restaurants are covered, but the store is covered if the restaurant is in the store. 
    We -- as if from the Boynton case, if the Act were interpreted as had been urged by the State of Virginia, then before a Negro could get a sandwich he would have to investigate the inter-corporate relations between the lunch counter and the bus terminal and the carrier. 
    The opinion interpreted the Act in the way that -- it was quite clearly the intent of the Act, but made that completely unnecessary. 
    You wouldn't -- you'd -- to getting people convicted of trespass and I've been in the case in which this was done in order to make a complete record and it's like an antitrust case. 
    You got to go in to the guy's records and invoices and call in suppliers and everything else, and I don't think it's called for but for the Act and enforcement would completely breakdown anytime, somebody really wanted to resist the Act.

    Well, I can only repeat what I said that, offers to serve the public means offer to serve the whole public. 
    Now, when he was questioned on various categories of the public in connection with racial, national and political beliefs, he said “Well, yes, I serve everybody”. 
    This is everybody and I submit that if a Negro in Clarksdale, Mississippi has to conduct a pretrial discovery of a restaurant to discover whether or not they are offering to serve interstate travelers and to whether or not a substantial amount of the food moves in commerce and so forth, this is a very formidable weapon that is not consistent with the intent of the Act or the language of the Act, the purpose of the Act and so forth. 
    Now I thought, what would I do if I wanted to counsel a man, how to set up a restaurant in which he could keep Negroes out, and its possible. 
    He could put up a sign saying “intrastate travelers only”, and then of course under the actual served provision he would have to check on the people who came in to find he didn't actually serve them, because you have both. 
    You have offered to serve and serve and then he'd have a very peculiar kind of diet there made of just of locals food and he couldn't have coffee or tea or salt or probably sugar and so forth. 
    And then of course there'd be other state action problems but it -- for someone who is genuinely eccentric and wants to do it and there are food faddists who do that kind of thing and other connections, it can be done.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The primary concern which I appeal with respect to whether or not these prosecutions have been abated by the enactment of the Civil Rights Act is whether or not there is any showing whatsoever as to whether these establishments or the establishment involved in the Hamm case was in fact covered by the provisions of the Civil Rights Act. 
    There is no proof whatsoever with respect to that and of course it was not an issue because these prosecutions were made in 1960. 
    The only evidence that can be gleaned from the records is this that this -- the Hamm and Ivory himself, the defendants were rejected for service at this restaurant in 1960 because of the fact that they were members of the Negro race. 
    It's also undoubted that the restaurant, the lunch room, serves the general public and that is the extent to which the record shows that McCrory's comes within the purview of the Civil Rights Act.

    Oh, of course the statute itself, Civil Rights Act, provides that it must serve or offer to serve interstate travelers. 
    And I submit that the mere proof and the fact that they offered to serve the general public is not an offer to serve general interstate travelers. 
    Now, that's born out I think by the construction as given to the Act by the only two cases that I'm aware of which were -- that have arisen under this Act and which why I've been here last Monday. 
    And I've only had access to one in a brief glance at the one from Alabama, but in the (Inaudible) and in the Alabama case apparently gave a great deal of consideration to showing that for instance no inquiry was made as to the place of residence to the person who presented himself. 
    The fact that advertisements were made up and down the interstate highways, the fact that the restaurant itself was on an interstate highway even to the extent of obtaining license numbers and so forth to see if out-of-state license -- licensed automobiles were in the parking lot of the restaurant. 
    And the quantum of food that was served and where that food was purchased from, none of that appears here. 
    And in the (Inaudible) case, the decision recites that the plaintiff and the United States contend that their offer to serve interstate travelers together with the fact is unquestionably did serve interstate travelers were sufficient to bring it within the scope of the law. 
    But none of that appears here. 
    And therefore, we submit that -- it's clear that there's no showing that this establishment came within the provisions of the law.

    My answer to your question I misconstrued it, I'm sorry, was remand which I think is the most that this Court could do with respect to this case for the determination of this question by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
    With respect to the application of Title I, Section 109, the saving clause of the federal statutes, I agree with the petitioner that there is no precise application of that statute here as I see. 
    It simply means that when an offense is created by a federal statute that statute is repealed on a pending prosecutions under that statute are abated unless -- or will not be abated unless Congress specifically authorizes their abatement. 
    Now, applying the analogy of that to the prosecutions which do not precisely, as I say fit here, I feel that the intent of the Congress is that where they mean for a prosecution to be abated, they specifically say so. 
    They have not said so here on the contrary, the punishment sections is specifically worded with respect to the future, no punishment shall be imposed or exercised of these rights. 
    I feel that if there had been a prosecution under a federal statute similar to the trespass statute of South Carolina, the prosecutions under that statute would not have been abated for the simple reason even on the federal jurisdiction under this law for the simple reason that Congress did not specifically designate their abatement.

    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    To future actions? 
    I have that -- and our position in the brief is with respect to that is this. 
    Under the present circumstances if a person should present himself for service at a -- in establishments that are covered under the Civil Rights Act, the proprietor as I see it has the charge of doing several things. 
    He can serve the person. 
    He can decline to serve that person. 
    And if that person at that time should decline to leave the premises, the proprietor then can allow him to sit there, if he comes in there 6 o'clock -- at 6 o'clock in the morning, he'll remain there till 6 o'clock that night. 
    Or he can use force to eject him as apparently would be permitted under South Carolina law and fairly similar circumstances with the similar involvement of rights or he can prosecute for trespass. 
    And our -- trespass is our position that under the trespass statutes, prosecutions could still be made if the proprietor should decline to serve a person who is otherwise entitled to it and that person at that time insist upon remaining after having been declined to be served. 
    Now, our position on that is predicated on the holding of this Court in Poulus against New Hampshire where the application for a religious ceremony or religious services or gathering was denied and improperly denied as found by the state court. 
    And this Court stated there that the person involved should have gotten his license or followed his procedural remedies in order to get that license prior to exercising his rights of religion under the Fourteenth Amendment without having to procure a license even though the license was wrongfully withheld from him. 
    And we submit that --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="daniel_r_mcleod" startTime="4084.172" stopTime="4264.481">
    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    I have advised whatever police officers that I have in the jurisdiction over not to make any prosecutions under this on the theory that the criminal actions cannot be used as a mean of circumventing Civil Rights Act. 
    Plus the fact that the arrest warrant should not be signed by the police officers but should, if an arrest warrant is going to be gotten be procured by the individual who operates the establishment. 
    Now, that -- I make that statement just as a matter of information to the Court. 
    I don't think it has an illegal bearing upon the matter but then that action has been independently undertaken by me. 
    Now, with respect to the custom that the petitioner refers to, the statute of course as Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned a moment ago and corrected me a moment ago, it requires only -- or states only that the custom must be required or enforced by the state or political subdivision. 
    The word fostered encouraged or required or enforced phraseology of that nature was eliminated during the course of the passage. 
    There are, as petitioner states in his briefs, many statutes. 
    In my state which do relate to the problem of matter of segregation, the statutes are detailed at length there. 
    There are statutes which require that a school be closed if a child is admitted pursuant to a court order. 
    A constitution in the state requires that separate schools be provided for children of separate races and that none be permitted to attend the school belonging -- provided for a child of another race. 
    But those statutes, the constitutionality of it, of course is manifest. 
    One example of that is the statute that has never been passed upon by a state or by a federal court, the constitutionality of that as I see is manifest, that requires a separate pay windows, separate dippers, separate pails, separate restrooms, separate workrooms be provided for members of the different races. 
    I have advised the Commission of Labor of my state that that statute is clearly unconstitutional and should be disregarded. 
    Now, it's not unusual for a statute where there's specifically been held to be unconstitutional or not to be kept upon the statute books of my state and that my observation in any other state. 
    One example to that is the Fair Trade Act of South Carolina which was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in 1957. 
    And there was a codification of the decennial codification of the laws in 1962 and the Fair Trade Act is found in the Code now. 
    It has no effect, no force and I submit it should not -- none of the segregation statute should be given any effect reflecting any official state, custom or encouragement of any custom with respect to segregation.

    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    None that -- I think this, there is one that would -- with respect to a railroad station in the City of Florence, and there is another one that does not pertain to this, I've forgotten what it is. 
    But none, ordinance, statute, constitutional provision or anything, there is nothing on the statute books that relates to segregation being required by law in this particular case. 
    The police captain, apparently without any urging and without any -- apparently an impromptu bona fide response said, “Well, let me say this. 
    It is my duty to enforce the law and not the custom”. 
    And we submit there is no evidence whatsoever of any state fostered, encouraged, required, or imposed custom. 
    Insofar as the position raised by the petitioner with respect to the validity of the warrant, we submit initially that's a matter of state law. 
    The State Supreme Court has held that the warrant charge one single offense and is a rather confusing record as counsel stated a moment ago, because it was agreed that the record in the Ivory case to be used as record in the Hamm case. 
    And consequently the charge to the jury by the judge is not appropriate. 
    Some provisions of the warrant itself had been deleted with respect to the Hamm case, but they appear in the transcript of record. 
    Nevertheless, it appears very clear that only one charge that of trespass under the statute involved was contemplated in the warrant. 
    The counsel for the petitioner Hamm and for Ivory, Mr. Samson in argument before the court for a motion of a direction of verdict, using these words, “Fails or refuses without a good cause or excuse to leave”, indicating that he had just one single statute in mind when this was submitted. 
    And additionally, no question of the application of the Fourteenth Amendment was raised on this point before the Supreme Court of South Carolina.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    This matter of leaving the store and leaving the premises I think is very easily resolved by looking at the warrant. 
    What happened is the manager asked them to leave the counter. 
    Any demand to leave the store was made by the police officer or at the direction of the police officer, that's what the warrant says. 
    And the warrant is born out by the testimony. 
    The warrant says, on page 2 now, which is the warrant, “By remaining along with Reverend Ivory at the lunch counter which is customarily operated on a segregated basis and refusing to leave the said counter, after the manager of said store, in the presence of city police Captain John M. Hunsaker advised him he would not be served and specifically requested him to leave said lunch counter. 
    And after the aforesaid police officer thereupon advised him that he would be arrested for trespass unless he left the said premises as directed”. 
    At page 78 of the record to which the Attorney General adverted refers to a request being made at the instigation of the police officer. 
    So the premises store conflict falls neatly in the place, in fact everything in the record is consistent with the warrant, and there's nothing inconsistent.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, there was claim of vagueness in connection with the multiplicity and just the open-end quality of the statutes that were used in the trial court, when the prosecutor was asked under what provision is this being brought. 
    He said under all the available law and then he had to specify even in Section 386, and then he referred to a ordinance of the City of Rock Hill, and then he referred to Section 388 which is the new statute. 
    386 incidentally was held unconstitutional by this Court last year. 
    And then the charge of the jury talked about civil trespass and breach of the peace, and then the intermediate appellate court affirmed on the ground of the old statute and the state's Supreme Court affirmed on the ground of the new statute. 
    And I think there's a sufficient allegations and claims about due process vagueness and fair warning in the case to encompass this article -- this argument, though this argument was not in terms made.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    Yes, it -- but it -- I don't claim it was made in exactly this way, but I think the entire issue of specificity was before the state court in some form. 
    May it please the Court, the argument concerning abatement which we have just presented in its constitutional statutory and common law dimensions is one that applies with singularly -- singular appropriateness, we submit, to the cases at bar. 
    Well, these petitioners, we submit, are not merely the beneficiaries of an overwhelming legislative declaration that expresses the conscience of the nation. 
    But they along with thousands of others in the same situation are the ones who without regard to personal security risked their liberty to arouse the conscience of the nation that led to the passage of the very Act which we claim here protects them. 
    The doctrine of abatement at each of the levels that we offered here is an ordinary expression of our law as it has existed even before this nation was republic. 
    It is still, except with a legislature, has expressly gone on record to the country recognized as well settled. 
    In fact, were these defendants to be punished while others today would not be punished, it would raise questions like those in the opinion of three of the Justices of this Court in the Rice versus Sioux City Cemetery case, I'd like to read a couple of sentences from that. 
    The Court dismisses this case because the Iowa legislature has provided that every person in Iowa except one who has already filed a suit can prosecute claims like this. 
    Apparently this law leaves everyone in Iowa free to vindicate this kind of right except the petitioner. 
    This raises a new question of denial of equal protection of the laws equally as grave as those which prompted us to take this case originally. 
    We cannot agree that this dismissal is justified merely because this petitioner is the only one whose rights may have been unconstitutionally denied. 
    It would be indeed a bitter departure from the spirit of our jurisprudence if these petitioners, perhaps uniquely situated, as those whose actions brought about the legal change in which we rely were punished because they had the courage and inspiration to awaken the conscience of this nation.

    As in the preceding case, since the filing of the petition for writ of certiorari on this case on September 3, 1963 and the granting of that petition by this Court on June 22nd of this year, the National Congress has enacted Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    That Title now, secures the petitioners and all other Negroes similarly situated the right to equal treatment in privately owned places of public accommodation which served the public if the operations of such places affect commerce. 
    That Title also makes it unlawful for any person to deny equal treatment in such establishments.

    Like the preceding case, these petitioners also contend that Title II mandates a reversal of the judgments below and the remanding of these cases for dismissal as a matter of federal law pursuant to the unique legislative phenomenon rule annunciated by this Court in Bell against Maryland and in accordance with the expressed terms of Section 203 (c) of Title II which we have just referred to permitting punishment for exercising the right to equal treatment in places of public accommodation. 
    The argument just made by Mr. Greenberg of course in the preceding case with respect to this we adopt. 
    But I'd like to point out that Arkansas like Maryland and unlike South Carolina does have a saving clause statute. 
    In fact they have two which relate to this problem and these statutes appear on pages 6 and 7 of our brief. 
    Unlike Maryland however, these Arkansas statutes refer only to repeal of any criminal or penal statute. 
    Consequently, if this Court for some reason should not agree with the petitioner's argument that Title II has the effect of compelling a reversal of these convictions as a matter of federal law and a remand of these cases for dismissal, then these cases may be subject to the same disposition made by this Court in Bell against Maryland that is a remand to the highest court of the state for consideration of the effect of the enactment of Title II on these convictions as a matter of state law. 
    It may very well, be as this Court held in Bell against Maryland that the Supreme Court of Arkansas, whose judgment this Court is now asked to review, might hold the enactment of Title II substituting a crime, a right rather for a crime and vice versa is a unique legislative phenomenon in that state. 
    And consequently, these convictions are outside of Arkansas' general saving clause statutes which relate only to repeal of criminal statutes, thus leaving the Supreme Court of Arkansas to hold applicable to these cases the common law rule requiring dismissal of a pending criminal proceeding whenthe legislature removes the state's condemnation from conduct that was formerly being criminal.

    Well, yes, they would be then saying here is the Civil Rights Act which is a part of the law of the state like any other federal statute which we now have to construe and find out what effect this new state law has on these pending convictions. 
    Respondents concede that Title II like any other federal statute as a part of the law of the State of Arkansas. 
    As a part of the State of Arkansas, as I've indicated, Title II not only removes Arkansas' condemnation of petitioner's conduct which was peacefully seeking food service in a department store and refusing to leave the lunch counter when ordered to do so by the owner. 
    But it precludes Arkansas from now imposing upon petitioners Lupper and Robinson of $500 fine and a 30 day prison term, that's what these petitioners' fate in this case.

    If as respondents' claim, Arkansas has to further expand on this point. 
    If these respondents claim Arkansas has now set its face against its officially segregated path and has now turned for the future, free from state imposed or sanctioned racial segregation in the public life of that state then certainly this new state policy might be taken into consideration by the Supreme Court of the state upon a remand of these cases to that Court to determine the effect of Title II on these convictions. 
    But as Mr. Greenberg has already argued, this remand for state court consideration of the effect of Title II is entirely unnecessary and there is ample federal authority and necessitate for remand for dismissal by this Court. 
    Petitioners here argue, as did petitioners in Bell against Maryland that their convictions violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since their convictions enforced racial discrimination in violation of that clause.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    If I might just for a moment summarize our position with respect to the abatement of these convictions before proceeding so that it would be clear to the Court exactly what our position is. 
    We say first, if this Court determines that enactment of the Civil Rights Act results in abatement of state prosecutions as a matter of federal law, then these convictions must be reversed and remanded for dismissal. 
    We say secondly that if this Court in interpreting Section 203 (c) determines that the states cannot carry out punishment even though the act of sitting in took place prior to adoption of the Civil Rights Act then these convictions must also be reversed here and remanded for dismissal below. 
    Now, our third position is that if this Court determines as a matter of federal law that there is no mandatory abatement of state criminal proceedings, then the cases would have to be remanded with instructions for the state court to determine the effect of its law of abatement in these circumstances. 
    Now, Mr. Greenberg has already pointed out, South Carolina does not have a saving clause and therefore the Civil Rights Act in that state interpret it as a part of the law of that state, these decisions would abate because the common law would be applicable and the state -- on the state law they would abate and the State of South Carolina could not discriminate against a federal law. 
    In Arkansas on the other hand, there is a saving statute and therefore it's a question of statutory interpretation if repeal means the same thing as repeal in the federal statute then the Supreme Court of Arkansas might hold that these convictions abate because there is no statute saving the punishment. 
    If not, then the proceedings do not abate and of course that would be a question of state law and the law of the state, they would not abate and then we could not come back here on that question. 
    Although of course we have other questions, constitutional questions, equal protection and so forth which we argued.

    Yes. 
    It appears that these petitioners went to the lunch counter and they were approached by the manager and the assistant manager. 
    The manager, he merely says he -- he told them he didn't want any disturbance and they'd have to leave. 
    Then the assistant manager testified that he approached some boys in the lunch counter and spoke to one, not one of these petitioners but one in the group and said, “Well, we're just not prepared to serve you now, would you excuse yourself?” 
    Meaning move away from the counter. 
    The manager went outside of the store and got the police officers and came back. 
    The police officers had already been called by another police officer, who had observed these issues going into the store and observed them sitting themselves at the counter and ran out and called the police headquarters and apparently was not too far away, that's when the manager went out there were the two police who was across the street. 
    The manager came back in with the two police officers and there were the petitioners walking out for the front door. 
    The police officer said, “Are you the two men” and/or the manager identified them as being among the five which he saw at the lunch counter and that was when they were arrested.

    From the time they came into the store initially when they -- on their way up at some time the whole business took place some time between 11:30 and -- well, no one knows the exact time but the going out and getting the police was apparently just a couple of minutes. 
    Now, before -- I would -- I'll come back to those facts when I get to my due process argument but I did want to say a word about equal protection argument. 
    We argue here as petitioners in Bell and the other cases decided last term that these convictions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since these convictions enforce racial discrimination in violation of that clause. 
    The same constitutionally relevant reasons which we urge so extensively and exhaustively in Bell for reaching this conclusion have been succinctly repeated in our brief here at pages 46 to 69.

    However, I think it should be noted again that since the granting of certiorari in these cases and this Court's decision in Bell, we now have a federal legislative prohibition against enforcement of the custom of segregation by the states which we did not have before when this Court considered the Bell conviction.

    I don't think there is a case specifically on custom. 
    I think what he meant to say, he took up the Greenville situation where we had an ordinance. 
    They took up the Lombard situation where you had an official declaration, but I don't know of any prior Supreme Court decision dealing with state court enforcement of custom. 
    So that -- because they had been argued here on prior occasions, I feel that this is why custom is included because as the -- a manager testified the South Carolina case there was no law, what he was enforcing was the custom of the community, not to serve Negroes. 
    And therefore, the state through these convictions and prosecutions and imposition of punishment we say the state is enforcing the custom of segregation. 
    It's like the situation in Shelley against Kraemer. 
    We had a specific federal statute there, on the right to acquire, lease, and hold real property without regard to race and color. 
    Now, we have a federal statute which says specifically that the courts may not enforce the custom --

    Well, according to the record in this case, it appeared this was universal in that particular City of Rock Hill. 
    But certainly it wouldn't have to be a substantial majority of the community following a particular custom of excluding Negroes, I would think, to say that we have in this community a custom of discriminating against Negroes and certainly in every southern state where the state as a matter of state policy has had state laws requiring segregation in various areas. 
    All such states I would say have a custom generally in the community of segregation solely from that as a matter of fact.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I believe that's the South Carolina one. 
    They went into a discussion of custom and the testimony of the manager was, in the South Carolina case if that was what he was following, the officer also said there's no law, it's custom. 
    I would like to move now to petitioner's due process claims in this case. 
    Petitioners' claims with respect to due process are the following. 
    First, these petitioners claim that there is no evidence in the record in this case to convict petitioners of failing to obey the store manager's order to leave the premises since no such order was in fact given, the only order given being an order to leave the luncheon area. 
    The second claim is that the plain words of the trespass statute here under which petitioners were convicted gave no fair warning that a failure to obey an order to leave the luncheon area was tantamount to a failure to obey an order to leave the premises which is the effect of the affirmance of petitioners' convictions here by the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
    As in the previous case, these petitioners are two Negro college students attending college in Little Rock and on April 13, 1960, they went into Blass' department store in Little Rock. 
    When these petitioners arrived, as I've said earlier, they were observed by police Officer Bair who followed them along with a few other Negro students into the store and observed them sitting themselves in the luncheon area located on the mezzanine level. 
    Officer Bair immediately left the store and reported his observations to police headquarters. 
    Two other police officers were sent to by headquarters to join Officer Bair. 
    The manager of the store, Mr. Holt, observed as he said, “five Negro boys sitting in the lunch room, three at the counter and two sat at the table.” 
    He then testified that he told each one of them in turn that he didn't want any disturbance and asked them to leave. 
    They refused. 
    The manager left the store and across the street found Police Captain Terrell and Lieutenant Talbot. 
    The mnager returned to the store with the police officer and identified petitioner as being among the five Negro boys he had asked to leave the lunch area. 
    Petitioners were on the main floor on their way out at this time, which was two to five minutes after the original encounter with the manager. 
    The incident took place between 11:30 and 12:00. 
    The assistant store manager as I said before testified that he too saw these boys and he said to one of them not the petitioner that, “We're just not prepared to serve you would you please excuse yourself?” 
    None of the officers actually heard the manager order these petitioners to leave the premises, but Captain Terrell testified on this case. 
    And on page 29 of the record, in two places, Captain Terrell said this, “He” referring to the manager “had requested our assistance to get them out from the lunch counter when he came over to get us”. 
    Then Captain Terrell said on the same page, “He told us that he had two boys that had refused to leave the lunch counter and asked that we assist them”. 
    In short, there's no testimony in this record to support any finding that the petitioners were asked to leave the premises as required by the statute here for conviction. 
    Petitioners were at all times orderly and they were arrested on an open charge and then they were --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In addition to the pages which you cited, the respondent on page 34 of its brief cites several additional pages, pages 28, 33, 40, 42 and 44 and you -- I would have a chance to read them all but you -- it's your position that none of these supports any finding at all that they're asked to leave the premises, isn't it?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right, that -- the -- and that the manager's testimony is ambiguous. 
    He just said I asked them to leave, but then the officer makes clear, and he was the state's witness as to what the order was that the manager gave. 
    The manager doesn't quote his exact words but the officer purported to quote exactly what the manager had said to him.

    -- that it shows positively that at all. 
    We say it does not. 
    What is positively shown is what the officer says that the order was. 
    He's the only one who dealt really specifically with what the order here is. 
    And then if you'll look at the facts here, here was a store open to the public including Negroes and the petitioners had been in there purchasing, and it just is not reasonable to think that the manager was saying, “get out of the store” as a whole.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    I'd like to just to call the Court's attention to the Bouie case which was here last term involving a similar situation. 
    There's a sit-in and involving a criminal trespass statute where this Court reversed the convictions under that South Carolina statute on the ground that the petitioners there had not been forewarned by the statute or any prior court decision that a statute prohibiting entry after warning would also apply to a refusal to leave after being invited. 
    So, this is the same kind of situation here where we have a statute which clearly requires an order to leave the premises being construed by a court to allow conviction for a refusal to leave a part of the premises. 
    This, of course the petitioners had no warning of. 
    And of course this Court has held previously in several cases now that where there is no evidence of the crime charged, this also violates due process of law. 
    I'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

    I, with the Attorney General and his staff of course represent the respondent in this action. 
    I think it proper that I mention at the outset that any lack of convincing quality in the brief from my oral argument I hope it is not based upon reasons or authority thereof but maybe my own in that missing -- the feeling that every young advocate may have at his baptism before this Court. 
    I think that petitioners and their several eminent counsel ought to be congratulated, perhaps envied on the magnificent job they've done in both the preparing their brief in this effective oral presentation. 
    But I necessarily disagree with them. 
    I think it proper that certain aspects of the record before this case be emphasized before I embark on the argument. 
    This case does involve a privately owned -- it's a family privately owned department store. 
    It does have a mezzanine tearoom that does serve luncheons. 
    And I certainly didn't mislead -- intend to mislead Mr. Justice Stewart by saying they just serve salads, they do have light luncheons in there. 
    But if you can imagine at just very briefly this is the type of place where during the serving hours a young lady comes out and models sweaters and skirts and other female attired to their customers that are seated there wherein they're almost all women that use this facility. 
    Now, these demonstrators came in and they weren't just five, they were five there perhaps when Mr. Holt came back or came upstairs. 
    But there were 15 or so demonstrators who came here and they strategically placed themselves across this narrow entrance at the tables and at the counters. 
    They were courteously asked to leave by the store personnel. 
    They refused to do so. 
    They want to question and argue with the store personnel.

    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    I don't think so.

    There's no testimony to that extent.

    Well, Mr. Lessenberry (Inaudible) precedes to that you referred us to, is the officer I gather testifying, “I asked them were they the ones at the lunch counter, and had Mr. Holt asked them to leave, they said yes, they wanted to be served”.

    And I think it's certainly explainable Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    In Pulaski County, I think there are perhaps 25% colored population, I'm sure there were a number of people in the store. 
    And it was the purpose of this officer, and correctly so under his sworn duty to ascertain that these were the ones that had violated the law, had refused to leave the premises and that those were the ones at the lunch counter.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    What about on page 29, about four or five questions down, “and did he” that's the manager “request you to arrest them?” 
    Answer, “He did and he had requested our assistance to get them out from the lunch counter”.
speaker="jack_l_lessenberry" startTime="8342.416" stopTime="8445.857">
    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    Yes, and that was one of the three references or two references found in the petitioners brief. 
    I don't think that this Court or any court is going to be concerned with the niceties of one phrase. 
    This is a part of a national concerted effort. 
    The Attorney General or the Solicitor General on his brief in Bell v. Maryland recited that there were over 20,000 demonstrations of this sort. 
    Mr. Goldberg -- Greenberg has said that there were some 3000 cases pending. 
    There are two from Arkansas as a matter of fact I don't know where the rest of them have come from. 
    But I can't imagine that anybody honestly believes that theses demonstrators were ingeniously ignorant of their rights here and in fact to use the phrase from this Court quoted arrest here. 
    They intended to violate this particular Act. 
    Two weeks previously, there had been a demonstration of some 50 persons and that's consolidated in this case, Briggs versus the State in the lower court. 
    50 demonstrators had been across the street bulwarks. 
    Is it remarkable that the same counsel appears in cases in South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana? 
    These cases were violation, they were flagrant violations of the law, and I (Inaudible) -- I think the record supports me but as a practical matter and certainly we must look to what the intent of these people were. 
    They intended to violate the law and they did so.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8445.857" stopTime="8466.208">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Inaudible) isn't it also -- didn't they also look to the intent of the owner of the store as to whether he just wanted to get them out of the counter and be able to get their patronage in the other parts of the -- other parts of the store or whether he want to get off of these premises and stay off the premises?

    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry

    -- that's simply correct.

    Yes. 
    And that is that the -- well, may I explain this time element and then go to that. 
    These people in the store when the demonstrators came in, went through a sort of a chain of command, the employees saw the people there, they telephoned the assistant manager and if I'm not mistaken he had to come up from the basement. 
    And that's when he asked several of the boys, the record sustains they're a group of boys, not just one, to leave, and when they refused then he went to see Mr. Holt. 
    The police, and of course, you have to know the geography here of 4th and Main Streets in Little Rock, but he had to go across the street to Women Bank and Trust Company to find two police officers and bring them back. 
    The reason that they were arrested is that they were still in the store. 
    And none of these other demonstrators were arrested because they had left. 
    These people attempted and did continue to violate the request. 
    They said they were there to buy some shades, which I'm thinking as the jargon of some sunglasses, I think the testimony reveals.

speaker="jack_l_lessenberry" startTime="9791.986" stopTime="9887.217">
    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    Yes, they were in a position to leave. 
    I think they were in one in the quarters, one was saying that he was looking at some shades. 
    The fact of the matter is though that after -- upon the request, upon two different requests they said, “Well, what for or why, we're not going to leave. 
    I want to argue”, and did argue. 
    Then I suppose for a period of time that being seen critical for the prosecutor that -- below, and I honestly don't think it's too critical here now that they stayed there anytime after they answered these two lawful requests. 
    I want to skip a significant portion of my argument and move over to the statement concerning the application of 203 (c) and that is as I read the notes or the brief of the petitioners, they say that there isn't retroactive application of the Civil Rights Act. 
    They admit that initially, but then they say that 203 (c) prohibits punishment, shall prohibit punishment and they would say it this time. 
    In other words they would admit or say to this Court, “We agree that this was a criminal act and that there is a valid prosecution and that there's no retroaction as far as the affirming state court conviction but on the other hand you cannot now convict them”. 
    I think that (Voice Overlap) --

    But it's not that you cannot now convict them, it's that you cannot now punish them.
speaker="jack_l_lessenberry" startTime="9896.205" stopTime="10200.707">
    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    Punish them. 
    That's the point. 
    In other words you would deprive from the entire legal process the thing to be gained in punishment from this. 
    It makes legal procedure, a criminal procedure a mockery and nothing more than a farce to my way of thinking at least. 
    They say and make a very emotional argument that if these punishments are to be permitted that this would be a last vestige of segregation. 
    And they'd acted -- the National Conference has said that these persons should not be convicted. 
    But if it please the Court, the National Conference did not provide for retroaction, Congress could have done that, they did not. 
    The National Conference in true terms was actually not in sympathy with these petitioners. 
    If they were, it would create a dual system of justice to my way of thinking simply for the benefit of these petitioners. 
    There have been a number of cases which dramatically points this out. 
    This Court denied certiorari, I think back in 1949, when the federal statutes were changed to -- from permitting imprisonment for rape at either death or life imprisonment. 
    After the charge, it went back for retrial and they argued that the jury be instructed to provide for a lesser term of years that the court be so -- the jury be so instructed. 
    The court refused to do so. 
    I think there's a significant difference in a man being fined $500 and given 30 days and not permitting the jury to give him some term of (Inaudible) -- years but serving a life imprisonment. 
    There are numerous analogies here -- the violations of the Emergency Price Control Act. 
    I don't think there's any question at this statute that we could twist it so it'd have federal origin, it would not have been abate -- abated under the federal saving statute. 
    I don't believe that the Supremacy Clause of the United States constitution has given such an interpretation that we're going to treat states one way, and federal laws another way. 
    I want to say something about historical prejudices in Arkansas in the south. 
    I can't help but fel something personal animosity and disappointment to deal with this argument. 
    I think that Arkansas and it's wrongful that Arkansas and the community of Little Rock be condemned for some unequated statutes. 
    I noticed one that was cited by the petitioners that has reference to separation of railways. 
    If you look at that statute, it was enacted within three years at Plessy v. Ferguson, and one that -- and it held that -- what this Court hold -- held at that time, I think a real fine analogy. 
    It was Mr. Greenberg's statement that he didn't believe that the provisions of the National Prohibition Act have been repealed by our own Congress. 
    Legislature seemed to be too busy trying to take care of new business road and disposing of old business has become ineffective. 
    There have been as far as I know, even the Little Rock School decision, that closing case, there wasn't any federal compulsion of the Little Rock School Board, they implemented their own plan of integration. 
    It's only because of the disturbance there of a few radicals. 
    Look at those cases, I invite the attention of the Court to see those cases where the community leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, the police officers all acted to enforce the law and I think that they have. 
    I can't believe that this Court would tell the people of Arkansas that we will take judicial knowledge that you're prejudice. 
    Psalm 11 says -- its kind of -- it seems to me appropriate here that if our foundation so fall, what shall happen to the righteous. 
    I think there are some righteous people. 
    I don't think it's proper. 
    If you can make an argument of vagueness -- if you can make an argument of vagueness of this statute, you can certainly make an argument of vagueness of this indictment that's brought against the people of Arkansas, because certainly there was no evidence submitted below. 
    There was no proof. 
    There was something -- some mere inference in their motion for new trial they wouldn't even argue. 
    And if this had been a jury discrimination case, this Court would hold consistent with its holdings in hundreds of other cases that these matters have to be brought to the state court's attention. 
    In Carter v. Texas, you can't just file a motion and gain proof and gain a reversal.

    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    I think the existing statute covers it, but I -- the -- as far as I know, it has not been interpreted by a case. 
    But to borrow a phrase if we go back to Sutherland in statutory construction in the purpose of a saving statute -- in the cases in federal courts, they all adhere to that purpose because in modestly enough, if these demonstrators caused its Congress to enact a Civil Rights Act, still those people acted imprudently when they went to a place and did not leave after they'd been advised to do so. 
    I want to talk very briefly now, if I may in regard to the case of Shelley v. Kraemer. 
    I'm not absolutely satisfied to simply distinguish Shelley v. Kraemer. 
    I think Shelley v. Kraemer says something more. 
    I think Shelley v. Kraemer confirms the fact that an individual has a right to discriminate if he so desires. 
    I understand Shelley v. Kraemer to say two or three different things. 
    The first is that a state court cannot require a person to discriminate if he does not wish to do so. 
    Also, Shelley v. Kraemer was determined, in part at least, upon the federal given right of colored people to deal in property as white men. 
    There is a phrase in Shelley v. Kraemer which is significant to me and that is voluntary adherence to restrictive covenants is not constitutional. 
    Isn't that an individual's right to discriminate voluntary adherence? 
    I believe that it is. 
    These cases are not like Marsh v. Alabama where the decision can rest on the right of religion or the Smith versus Allwright or Terry v. Adams where under the Thirteenth Amendment a person has a right. 
    They are not cases involving at this time, I hope, interstate commerce where we could invoke Boynton v. Virginia. 
    None of these cases and none of these principles say that a person has a right to go to a particular restaurant or a hotdog stand on a corner or a mezzanine tearoom and demand service. 
    Even the petitioners in their brief describe it as some sort of right. 
    They don't define it for us. 
    And then, in my closing moments I want to --

    As a covered establishment, but one thing further and I think this is most significant to the respondent's argument Mr. Brennan, these persons weren't refused on the basis of race, color, religion or those items set forth in the Civil Rights Act. 
    I believe that a man still has a right under the Civil Rights Act to tell a particular person to leave his restaurant so long it's not within one of those prohibited specifically named thing.

    I think perhaps maybe I have just a minute to talk about one further thing here and that is extension of the Fourteenth Amendment in this case to cover other than what has been known as state action. 
    And that is this, after remarking that state custom could amount to state action or that judicial action is state action, and I suppose they mean more than state action. 
    It's state action which denies due process of law. 
    Then they asked this Court to draw a new line, to use a new line, but if we do this, then we forget the fact that Congress submitted one Fourteenth Amendment to the states, the states legislatures accepted those Fourteenth Amendments, those are the ones that should be applied here.

    Thus petitioners candidly give us a peek into the twilight zone of what they would suppose the law to be.

    This is too forebode -- foreboding to me the constitutional rights of others should not be drowned in such shallow stream to afford a footstone to go into this wilderness of legal entanglements. 
    One concluding remark, much has been said about the rights of property and property rights as opposed to personal and individual rights. 
    I submit to you that a table or a chair or an acre of ground or even a facility does not possess any rights.

    Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry 
    Yes. 
    I agree that it did. 
    The motion did but there wasn't any proof in the record though, nothing that I know of. 
    I certainly appreciate the courtesies of the Court had given me and extended me and if there are no other questions, I'll take my chair. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Constance Baker Motley

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I rise simply to point out those places in the record where the manager testified as to the time which elapsed between the time he asked them to leave and he got the police and came back. 
    On page 47 on direct examination, he was asked by the state's attorney. 
    Question, “About how long would you say you were gone from when you left to go to get the officers until you came back? 
    How many minutes would you say approximately?” 
    Answer “Oh, two or three minutes I guess, perhaps five no more”. 
    And then on cross-examination by these petitioners' counsel, he was asked that question again and he was asked this question by Mr. Anderson.

    What page is this?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11366.567" stopTime="11419.369">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Page 51, I'm sorry, I didn't mention the page. 
    The first page was page 47, and now on page 51 on cross-examination, “You say it took three minutes to go down and get the officers, is that correct?” 
    Answer “Something like that”. 
    So that was gone over with the manager and locations as to the time element involved. 
    And then the manager seems to be quite sure that there were only five Negro boys involved here. 
    On page 46 of the record, he states what he observed and he said, “There were five Negro boys”. 
    And then again on page 51, again on the cross-examination, he was asked “Now, again, how many colored men were there?” 
    Answer “Five”.

    What is the relevance of that to your argument, would you mind --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11423.273" stopTime="11450.792">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, I was simply pointing out that the -- there were some questions from the Court as to what time elapsed before the manager returned on the question of whether they were leaving the store as the officers came in whether they left the lunch counter. 
    And it seems relevant that they did by this testimony, leave immediately upon being requested to do so.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="11450.792" stopTime="11456.440">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that on the premise that it would -- there's no evidence to show that they left --

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="11460.847" stopTime="11462.568">

    That's right, on that question.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="11462.568" stopTime="11464.230">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that a (Inaudible) rule argument?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11464.230" stopTime="11466.635">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes. 
    Now, the other issue --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="11466.635" stopTime="11471.960">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, is there any evidence to the contrary of that to which you --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11471.960" stopTime="11526.292">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No, there is no evidence to the contrary, that is there's no evidence that they just stayed there and persisted and would not leave the place altogether. 
    This tends to show that they were requested to leave and they came out of the lunch counter and were out of the way. 
    They're on their way out of the store. 
    Now, the second point as to how many were there, it was pointed out for this reason that there's a suggestion that they were not denied service because of their race, but because there was a large group of men demonstrating, and the manager did not have that impression at all. 
    He testified twice that there were only five and he emphasized Negro boys again to make the point that this was a denial on account of their race.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="11526.292" stopTime="11551.365">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think the record justifies an argument along the lines that was made that there was evidence to show that despite the fact that it might have been racial discrimination the real reason they were ordered out was because they were in numbers and at a place that interfered with the business quite apart from their race?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11551.365" stopTime="11553.781">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11556.544" stopTime="11569.118">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    There's no issue on that and the business of the lunch counter being limited to women or patronized predominantly by women is no where in the record.

    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11575.002" stopTime="11588.736">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    They were not misled as to what this denial was based on. 
    They stated it emphatically that all of these cases were sit-in demonstrations involving Negroes denied service on account of their race.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="11588.736" stopTime="11597.253">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On the other hand, the record doesn't show that these were demonstrations. 
    It shows affirmatively to the contrary, doesn't it? 
    These people said they didn't know each other before and --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="11597.253" stopTime="11622.495">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, they -- there was testimony to that effect, but I think that they did go there for the purpose of attempting to secure service which they probably understood would be denied because of their race. 
    I don't think there's any question that they went there to try to end the policy of discrimination.
