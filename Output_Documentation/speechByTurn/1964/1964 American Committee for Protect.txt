American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born v. Subversive Activities Control Board

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 44, American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, Petitioner, versus Subversive Activities Control Board. 
    Mr. Terris, you may continue your argument.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="13.622" stopTime="47.168">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The outset I'd like to point out an error in the Government's brief. 
    The Government does not now claim that the Board found the petitioner actually arose on the international legal defense in 1932 or 1933, this -- an organization which had its headquarters in Moscow. 
    While there was considerable evidence indicating this fact, we have overlooked contrary evidence and we think, as the petitioner thinks, that the Board deliberately did not resolve this conflict in the evidence.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="47.168" stopTime="49.745">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Where is that in your brief, Mr. Terris?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="49.745" stopTime="278.759">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, it appears in the statement we put -- but it also appears at various points during the discussion of the evidentiary questions in several places. 
    But it's -- I think it's first on page 4 and the footnote on page 4 is where our reasoning, yes in our brief, it's where our reasoning was. 
    The Board clearly didn't explicitly find it and we thought that it had implicitly found it and we agree with the petitioner that probably even that is not so. 
    Now, I'd like you to turn to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question yesterday as to the meaning of the aid component of the statute more explicitly whether it requires directly aimed at forcible overthrow of the Government or advocating forcible overthrow of the Government. 
    I think I mentioned yesterday that we started from the proposition that Section 3 (4) on its face strongly looks the Government's way because it says that all the Government need to show, to show that an organization is a Communist-front is that it operates primarily for the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist-action organization, a Communist Party. 
    On its face, all that it requires is aid and support and not aid and support of any particular kind of or for any particular purpose of the Communist-action organization. 
    And this is supported by Section 2 (7) which describes Communist-fronts as organizations which conceal the facts as to their true character and their purpose in order to obtain support from persons who would not otherwise give it. 
    We think it's quite clear that if it was directly aiding overthrow of the Government or advocating overthrow of the Government, not many non-Communists would be in any doubt as to the control of the organization or to its purpose and therefore it would not fulfill this description. 
    Now, petitioner points to the beginning, the first phrase of 2 (7) that says, well the reason that the Communist-action organization is doing this, setting up Communist-fronts as to aid its objectives under Section 2 (6) and these are forcible overthrow of the Government. 
    Well, that's of course exactly the point that I was making yesterday. 
    But this is exactly why they setup Communist-fronts but it doesn't mean that Communist-fronts themselves advocate overthrow of the Government or directly aid overthrow of the Government. 
    They do other more immediate things. 
    And I think this is if -- the legislative history of this statute is extremely lengthy, but I think out of the reading of the -- the both -- both the testimony of the congressional hearings and the debate on the floor of Congress on the prompt provisions is quite clear that what they were aiming at is organizations which are seemingly harmless that seem like the organizations defending the Bill of Rights or civil liberties or the rights of farmers or labor but in fact are controlled by the Communist Party and are in fact are aiding it. 
    There's no indication whatsoever that as to Communist-fronts, they are -- that the -- that Congress believed that they directly advocated overthrow of the Government. 
    And I may say that that distinction is also clear in the committee report which petitioner's counsel cited to you yesterday. 
    All that says is that the Congress was not aiming a mere theoretical problem. 
    It was aiming at a problem that was a serious danger to this country. 
    Of course that -- and that again is exactly what I was trying to say yesterday that if the Communist Party was just interested in abstract Marxism, the statute would not have been passed.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you think that the part of saying is to involve or to have itself engaged, as part of the record, is that the original Communist-action definition?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="304.938" stopTime="332.549">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think you would. 
    I think, an argue could have been made if the Communist-fronts provisions weren't in the statute at all. 
    That the definition of organization in the statute is so broad that it could have covered Communist-fronts. 
    The difficulty is that I think it's quite clear by putting in Communist-fronts that the Congress wanted to deal with this type of organization under the Communist-front provisions.

    Well, that was what they said they were interested in the Board found in the basis of, we believe, ample evidence and I like to get to that evidence on just how we did deliberately served the Communist Party in a moment but I -- before I get to it, I like to point out that if the petitioner's argument is accepted, there will be no more Communist-front provisions in the statute. 
    Not only -- there isn't a bit of evidence in this record, not a bit and we wouldn't ever expect them that they were advocating overthrow of the government, or that they were directly attempting to have overthrow of the government. 
    Nor, as far as I know and description of the other Communist-front cases is in the Appendix to the Government's brief has any one of the other organizations ever done any of these things (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="510.644" stopTime="515.615">

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No, no, no. 
    They in fact are not doing it. 
    In fact, they do not advocate overthrow of the government in these organizations or directly aid overthrow of the government. 
    They do not, Your Honor. 
    That -- to the extent that the Communist Party does those things, it does it itself. 
    There's no need to have separate organizations to directly do those things. 
    When it wants to conceal these purposes then it sets up the subsidiaries. 
    In order to deceive non-Communists to support various Communist positions which on their face do not directly relate to overthrow of the government.

    A very large proportion of its -- of its -- the people suit, cases it handled involved Communism or some other type of subversion or some dispute whether it's 10% or 50%, it's a very large proportion far more than the proportion of subversion cases and the deportation cases generally. 
    In addition, the petitioner -- again, this is the objective fact, it advocated repeal of many of these statutes. 
    Nothing I said is anything wrong with doing this. 
    Now, the Communist Party used these facts in order to show that it's purportedly non-Communist organization was defending Communist Party members and protesting harassment by the Government of the Communist Party. 
    Now, why did the petitioner do this? 
    Did he do it -- I suppose everything that I have said, the American Civil Liberties Union also has done. 
    A witness testified who was a party to the choosing of the chief officer of petitioner. 
    The petitioner -- two leading officers deliberately carried out the policies of the Communist Party and running petitioner. 
    Another witness testified that the third leading officer of the petitioner was acting for the Communist Party when she was an officer of petitioner. 
    A local branch of petitioner was setup because of the discussions by the Communist Party that it had to have an organization to defend party members against deportation. 
    It was setup by -- this branch was setup by a party member under instructions from the Communist Party to do this and then later on this person became the chief officer of the branch. 
    Two other branches were setup, in order for the purpose of defending party members. 
    Now, it seems to us this evidence takenas a whole establishes not the petitioner happened to defend Communists because he was interested in Civil Liberties but because he was deliberately interested --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    The record does not show control -- that kind of control over the national organization or the local organization and the Board made no findings that there was control and the reason it did not do so, was that the statute Section 3 (2) of the statute which defines the organization for the purpose of the Act is considerably broader than that. 
    It says any group of persons whether or not incorporated permanently or temporarily associated together for joint action. 
    And the Court of Appeals said the national organization or local organizations were tightly woven together as it says intermeshed. 
    I could point you all kinds of evidence to this fact. 
    I suppose the most damming evidence on this point is the fact that the petitioner and the local committee said in their own publications that the local committees were a part of, that's their own phraseology a part of the national committee, affiliated with the national committee. 
    Whenever petitioner was setting fort in its own documents, statistics concerning what it was doing, it always included the statistics of all the local committees. 
    It never indicated that these local committees were separate. 
    I don't think -- Your Honor, I think the evidence is overwhelming that these were the same organization.

    Well, the reason that their evidence -- there is overwhelming evidence that these organizations were very tightly interwoven. 
    Now, if that's the case of the legal aid bureaus, then the answer is if the national -- let me point out, Your Honor that our evidence isn't just that the national group is controlled by the Communists. 
    Our evidence is that the locals are controlled by Communists. 
    In other words, the pattern is identical that -- that's why we rely on the locals. 
    If we only had evidence I suppose of the national, then what we would have found is that probably Mr. Forer would be here saying what's all when an organization and there are no Communist in the locals and that must show that the Communists really aren't in control. 
    We are the converse, there are Communists both places and it's the Government that's relying on the fact that this is a single organization and the common pattern shows control by the Communist Party.

    The forms promulgated by the Department of Justice required a detailed financial accounting. 
    They provide for all contributors. 
    The question would arise whether an ordinary dues-paying member would be considered a contributor. 
    I think there is an argument, I'm sure Mr. Forer would make it if we had that case here, there is an argument that when the Congress said you didn't have to disclose members that you didn't have to disclose people who were doing just the ordinary things that a member does paying ordinary dues.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    It's just very difficult for me to believe, in fact I just find it repugnant to believe that the Government is entitled to impose this kind of destructive control of an organization which concededly does nothing but constitutionally protected laudable activities on the finding by the administrative agency that the hidden motivation, which he calls purpose, that the hidden motivation for these agencies is to help the Communist Party.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, he says hidden. 
    He says they're exposing the real nature whether it's hidden or not on the -- an ulterior motive that's what it amounts to. 
    He says the American committee here does nothing else let it say, leaving aside some of the activities that they don't even question, does nothing else but defend aliens in deportation cases oversimplified a bit. 
    That's all it does. 
    He says that's okay provided its motivation is to defend the particular alien. 
    But if it has an ulterior motive, it not only wants to win the case for the alien who may be a Communist or a non-Communist or just accused of being a Communist, but it's an additional one to win the case for the alien that has an ulterior motive. 
    It isn't even a motive that the reason we want to help this alien is that it will somehow benefit the Communist Party. 
    He says that satisfies the aid component. 
    That just sounds to me to be thoroughly outlandish and thoroughly unconstitutional.

    You're saying it now in a way that I understand the Ggovernment's position.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2139.382" stopTime="2310.424">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, I -- if I misled Your Honor by the use of the word ulterior, I'm sorry. 
    But to me, when you talk about real reasons as distinguished from the actual objective fact of what you're doing, that relates an ulterior motive. 
    Now, I don't want to quibble on the use of that word ulterior. 
    Now, I think it is instructed to look at the kind of evidence that the Government relied on to prove for this real reason of what I call this ulterior motive. 
    And I have spent although I said in my brief the whole thing is so thoroughly thought farfetched and so repugnant to me that I don't think we even have to examine the evidence. 
    I attempted in my brief to examine every evidentiary finding that the Board cited and supported that. 
    And I must say that it is simply enough -- it aroused my indignation and I really think that the whole thing is an outrage to put it bluntly. 
    It consist of doing things like putting on a man like John Lautner who -- a Communist who turned an informer and professional witness in the pay of the Department of Justice who knew nothing about the work of the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born and he gives it as his opinion, and the Board seriously relies on this. 
    He gives it as his opinion that the purpose of the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born is to defend Communists. 
    Now, as a matter of fact that doesn't even satisfy his definition because of -- it should be, it should have been -- Mr. Wendell Willkie's purpose when he defended Mr. Schneiderman -- to defend Mr. Schneider. 
    And I may say also that either standards of the Board used in this case for determining this ulterior motive, I don't think Mr. Willkie would have been so well off, because there's evidence in this record that Mr. Willkie not only defended Mr. Schneider, and in the course of that as a lawyer, it was his obligation within the area of his professional responsibility to accept directions from his client to be was going to represent him at all. 
    But I'll tell you what else Mr. Wendell Willkie didas it appears in this record. 
    He wrote a letter to Mr. Abner Green the executive secretary of the committee the -- that war of the Government and he said, “Dear Mr. Green, I want you to know that I think you're doing a great job. 
    Keep up with this work”. 
    And he didn't have to do that. 
    It wasn't essential to his representation of William Schneiderman and that is the kind of evidence that they used to determine this -- but I won't say ulterior, this real motive and this kind of thing that you inevitably get into if you go around determining real motive by something other than the objective nature of their activities.

    Where in the record says that?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2339.960" stopTime="2448.876">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, I take non-deviation. 
    In the Communist Party case they're big -- they're a big deal leaving aside this pre-1940 evidence about the Communist International but the big deal was this evidence in non-deviation. 
    And Justice Frankfurter have said, “Look, they agreed what the Soviet Union over a best variety of topics over -- over all the years of their existence in regardless of twist and turns” and that was the big deal in the Communist Party case so the Board here makes a finding in non-deviation. 
    Do you know what it's based on? 
    It said the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born is opposed to political deportations and political denaturalization as well as every other kind and the Communist Party of the United States is also and this I suppose is a sinister opposed the statute for the deporting of Communists. 
    And that's the basis of their finding at non-deviation. 
    Now, talking about funds, there's no suggestion here and no evidence here that the American Committee made any profits from this. 
    In fact anybody that -- you could read directly, the idea that made any profits is really fantastic or that they ever gave a single penny to the Communist Party or that they had misappropriated funds. 
    And thought about concealment in getting money from non-Communist, how any person who gave money to the American Committee could have been unconscious of the fact that the American Committee would very likely use that money to defend among others people accused of being Communist including people as to whom the accusation even happen to be right, in anyone could believe that their money was not being used for that purpose is inconceivable. 
    They would have to be deaf, dumb, and blind.

    No, it's not the whole record, but if you read the findings of the Board with any perception, their findings demonstrate how hollow their thing is.

    At present, it is.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2528.321" stopTime="2772.231">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Yes, and may I say -- and may I say about that. 
    In the first place, the Board relied on that for its control findings and if you analyze it carefully you will see that that's all that it has to do with it. 
    In the second place, this episode which -- which was flatly contradicted by Abner Green although you couldn't tell it from the Boards, a version the Court admitted that it is flatly contradicted. 
    Even if you believe that this episode happened. 
    In the first place according to Lautner, it happened at neither 1941 and 1942 which is 10 years or 11 years before the beginning of the critical period. 
    In the second place, it is still doesn't indicate why he was picked -- or why the Communist Party preferred him over another candidate. 
    And that there are other objections, allow me to specify. 
    So far as the aid component is concerned, they rely on Lautner's opinion testimony. 
    Now, Lautner may have been an expert on the Communist Party, he was no expert on the American Committee. 
    I'd like to say one other thing which is really prompted by a remark that Mr. Justice Goldberg made earlier. 
    The fact that I fairly touched on the control of component doesn't mean that I think that we have a weak case on the control of component. 
    It's just that there are an awful lot of points here that could be argued and for purposes of oral argument, I just had to be very selective to the point where I couldn't really say much about the controller component. 
    But I would like to give you one example, not because of the evidence itself but it's an example of what you face when you get this kind of a case. 
    One of the big items that the Court of Appeals singled out is evidence singled out is evidence of control is that the American Committee in 1952 referred to three decisions of this Court in the alien field and said that those decisions were terrible, they destroyed democratic rights and this Court has deserted its duty to protect the Bill of Rights. 
    And you know what was the special sinister is that the Daily Worker all said similar things about two of the decisions. 
    Now, those decisions were Carlson against Landon which upheld the right of the Attorney General to hold aliens choose to be a Communist and deportation proceedings without bail, Harisiades against Landon which upheld the constitutionality of the retroactive Communist deportation statute and the Spector case which upheld the constitutionality of the self deportation law though very narrow. 
    In each of those -- each of those cases was sponsored by the American Committee. 
    And as a disappointed litigant, I think it had the judicial right of disappointed litigants to go to the tavern and curse out the judge. 
    But what the Court overlooked in its hurry to see what the Daily Worker said was what the dissenters said about those opinions. 
    Justice Black in the Carlson case said that the majority showed a shocking disregard of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. 
    Justice Douglas in Harisiades case said that the majority was repudiating the traditions of -- which underlay the Bill of Rights and I won't take time to quote -- but Justices Jackson and Frankfurter didn't think very much of the majority opinion in the Spector case. 
    The point is that you get a situation where -- where the Courts are beguiled by this pseudo-historical discussion about in the abstract, about the menace of Communism, some Communist-front though who raises and gives money to the party, it does things which have nothing to do with this record, and the Court gets so beguiled by this theoretical abstract concept that it just departs from its responsibility to review the record in the light of the evidence in the way the Court is supposed to review the record. 
    And that is what happened in this case. 
    Thank you.
