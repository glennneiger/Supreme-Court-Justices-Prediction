   Argument of Merle L. Silverstein

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court. 
    This appeal involves a criminal prosecution for the felony of income tax evasion. 
    But the court below, the petitioner was indicted in two counts for the years 1956 and 1957. 
    He was acquitted as to the 1956 count but convicted as to the 1957 count. 
    The district court then assessed punishment as 15 months imprisonment and a $2000 fine. 
    Now the sole question presented here on this appeal is whether or not the jury should have been given lesser offence instructions. 
    This would have given them the alternative of convicting the defendant on a misdemeanor under Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code which is the Section which makes it a misdemeanor to willfully fail to pay a tax when do and also the failure to give the jury a lesser offense instruction under rule -- under Section 7207 of the Internal Revenue Code which makes a misdemeanor for any person willfully to file a false return. 
    These instructions were both specifically requested by the defense below and they were refused by the district court, that action was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Certiorari of course was sought and granted. 
    We feel of course that in order to consider this question, there should be some fearful consideration to the facts involved in the case. 
    In this particular instance, the omitted income which was the basis of the indictment involved only a single capital gain transaction in each of the two years in question. 
    Briefly in March of 1956, the tax payer purchased a large track of land for $20,000. 
    He merely sold a small piece of that track for $22,500. 
    Then the following year, he sold another small piece of a large track for $27,000. 
    Neither of these two transactions were reported on his 1956 and 1957 returns. 
    Now none of these facts were disputed at the trial. 
    That was freely conceded by the defense that these sales were made and that these sales were not reported on either return. 
    But the sole issue that was contested at the trial below was that of the tax payer’s intent. 
    The only evidence the government had to prove intent was a statement which the tax payer gave to a special agent of the intelligence unit in May of 1960 about two years after the 1957 return had been filed. 
    In this statement the tax payer admitted all of the facts and questions that the income -- that the sales were, that they were not put in his return and that he intentionally omitted them from his return and then the statement concludes in regards to the 1957 return with this, I knew I should have reported the 1957 sale but my wife did not know that it should have been reported. 
    It was not my intention to evade the payment of our proper taxes and I intended to pay any additional taxes due when I was financially able to do so. 
    This was the –-

speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="279.336" stopTime="492.153">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    She was not indicted. 
    Now the record is absolutely devoid of any other evidence of intent. 
    As a matter of fact, as even the Eighth Circuit conceded in its opinion, all of the other evidence showed just the opposite, it showed a lack of any intent to evade and a complete absence of any of the badges of fraud. 
    Some of the items which the Eighth Circuit highlighted were for example, there was no attempt made in these real estate transactions to use straw parties of false names. 
    The defendant dealt in his own name at all times. 
    Secondly, the payments for these transactions were always by check, Mr. Sansone took checks in his own name endorsed them and deposited them in his own regular bank account. 
    Thirdly, the proper documentary stamps were fixed to the deeds, properly and truthfully showing the purchase prices which were paid which Mr. Sansone received for these properties. 
    Fourth, all deeds were properly recorded giving notice to the entire world and fifthly, there was no consistent pattern of under-reporting of income. 
    Outside of these two isolated transactions Mr. Sansone’s returns had been correct in all details. 
    Now this was the government's case. 
    The defense revolved chiefly around the testimony of the petitioner himself and as I say he admitted that he made these sales and did not put them in his return, the reason he gave was that he anticipated huge capital expenditures on this property. 
    He told the jury and this was corroborated by expert testimony from an architect, from an engineer and from the mayor of the city in which the property was located. 
    But he told the court and the jury that there was a stream running through his property called fish pack creek and this creek was creating a serious health and safety hazards that it was constantly over-flowing with sewage and all sorts of other things and that they had told Mr. Sansone that he must fix this creek immediately after the State Highway Commission of Missouri had resolved its problems in connection with the adjacent street. 
    Mr. Sansone had estimates that the minimum cost for fixing his creek would be $40,000 but he couldn't start and he couldn't get a final estimate until the adjacent highway of course, had been altered in accordance with the plans of the Missouri Highway Commission and so based on these facts the defendant below testified that he honestly believed that he did not have to report any capital gain until he had ascertained what these additional costs were going to be and then he could compute based on these two sales made whether or not he had a gain to report or not. 
    Now it was considered by everybody and of course we here conceded this was not a proper evaluation of the tax law by the defendant. 
    It was a mistake, it was conceded at the trial that it was a mistake, but it was the defense of the trial below that this was an honest mistake that, whereas the tax payer did intentionally omit these things from his return, did intentionally fail to make these capital gain reports in his return. 
    It was not -- it did not arise out of any tax evasion motive. 
    It arose strictly out of his mistaken interpretation of my client.

    Whether it was willfully or mistakenly, but honestly done at that point.
speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="630.329" stopTime="881.232">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    I think that it was virtually conceded the trial that it was willful not accidental, but the question was whether or not it was done with an intent to defeat and abate taxes, that was the issue. 
    I think at the outset, that we ought to consider, please the court briefly the general rules which govern lesser included offense instructions under Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules. 
    Now the solicitor concedes in his brief that in connection with criminal prosecutions generally, although for some unknown reason not income tax prosecutions that a lesser offense instruction is required if two criteria are met, first of all the lesser offense for which you're seeking the instruction must be included in the greater offence which is charged and secondly, the evidence must justify the lesser offence that is to say there must be some substantial conflict concerning the aggravating elements and we use aggravating element of course, to mean that element which when added to the lesser offence escalates it to the greater offence. 
    Now the Solicitor concedes this that this should apply generally to criminal prosecutions. 
    If for some reason unsupported by the authorities, the solicitor apparently takes the very bold position that this should not apply to income tax prosecutions. 
    He argues in his brief that when the government makes a charge of a felony under Section 7201 which is the tax evasion statute, when they make the charge and when they make their prima facie proof at the trial that then they are entitled to go to the jury on Section 7201 only and nothing less. 
    In other words as we take it the government is simply saying that rule 31 (c) for some reason doesn't apply to income tax prosecutions and to the jury and an income tax evasion case should never have the alternative of perhaps disbelieving part of the government's prima facie proof, believing some of it, but perhaps disbelieving some of it and finding the defendant guilty of one of one of the lesser included misdemeanors instead of the felony. 
    They offer no authority for this position except to say that it is consistent with the prosecutorial policy of the Department of Justice to treat all alleged evasion cases as 7201 felonies only and apparently the department does not consider 7203 and 7207 as available statutes under which to prosecute, if they have any evidence whatsoever of a possible evasion. 
    Now it appears that the department is seeking to get this court's blessings to their prosecutorial policy and are asking this court to hold that once they charge under 7201 a tax evasion and once they make prima facie proof then that's it, there is no such thing as lesser offenses and they're entitled to a conviction and to go the jury under 7201 and nothing less. 
    Well, we simply can't see any justification in logic, precedent, legislative history or what have you to uphold this position by the government. 
    Rule 31 (c) as far as we can tell is a codification and reiteration of the common law and it was intended to apply to all criminal prosecutions. 
    Apparently, there is some move afoot in the solicitor's office to set income tax evasion cases apart from other prosecutions. 
    I happened to be in the courtroom yesterday and heard the argument in the Jabon case where the solicitor argued that complaints are different for income tax evasions. 
    They should have different requirement than complaints another criminal prosecutions. 
    Now in this case, they're urging a different rule in regard to lesser included offenses.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If you were right, you would concede at least as you now see that the jury could have found it 7203 and 7207.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    On this indictment?
speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="937.447" stopTime="1136.534">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    Now, we simply contend that income tax evasion should be different from no other criminal prosecutions and if a tax evasion charge necessarily includes lesser offences as this court held it does include in the Spies case specifically held that it included lesser offences. 
    They should be treated no differently than any other federal crime and rule 31C should be held to apply. 
    Now, to this extent, we agree with the solicitor that once a jury has convicted a defendant of income tax evasion, of income tax evasion and there and have rejected of course any lesser offences, then section 7201 is the only statute which should apply and prescribe the penalties. 
    We are making no content that there is an overlap and that a tax evasion conviction should be governed by some misdemeanor statute to the overlap that was suggested to the court in Achilli's case, we are not making that contention. 
    If the jury makes a finding of guilty, of tax evasion and they have rejected any possibility of lesser offences, then of course 7201 is the only section we should apply and we should prescribe the penalty. 
    But, we say just as in any other law, this does not preclude the possibility of there being lesser offences and does not preclude the necessity for when the evidence indicates it for instructions on those lesser offences to be given. 
    Now, in regards to this specific instruction was the first one that was requested was under 7207. 
    This as I noted before is a provision which makes it a misdemeanor to willfully file a false tax return. 
    It does not require any intent to defeat or evade tax as it merely requires that the false return be willfully filed. 
    Significantly, a statutory predecessor which was 3616 A of the 1939 code did require an intent to defeat and evade. 
    But, when the court was rewritten in 1954 code and substituted section 7207 replaced 3616 A and it simply requires willfully filing a false return to constitute the misdemeanors. 
    It specifically eliminated the phrase dealing with the intent to evade. 
    The eight circuits in affirming this case simply followed its previous holding in Manko v United States, that section 7207 does not apply to income tax returns. 
    Now, the solicitor general has had two opportunities to support this opinion, in its brief opposing certiorari and in the brief on the merits in this case. 
    In both instances, the solicitor has failed to do this. 
    He has failed to support the Eight Circuit opinion or to do anything to attempt to justify it. 
    We take his silence to mean that the solicitor and the government concede that section 7207 does in fact apply to income tax returns as well as other returns.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="1262.972" stopTime="1514.566">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    If they involve different ingredients that's correct, but, for example, in this indictment 7201, one of the essential prerequisites of a felony charge as this court held in Spies was some affirmative act showing a willful intent to evade taxes. 
    Now, that thing, that affirmative act in this case was the filing of a false return. 
    So the filing of a false return, a misdemeanor itself was also a portion of the larger charge, so they could not find him guilty of both. 
    It would, in my opinion be included as Double Jeopardy. 
    And anyway, we feel and I think the solicitor will probably agree in view of his prior admissions and I believe in his petition opposed in his brief opposing certiorari in the Dillon case, they conceded that 7207 does apply to income tax returns and I feel this coupled with their silence as to the Eight Circuit position leaves no alternative but that they must concede that it does apply to income tax returns. 
    And this is not an issue at this time. 
    And what the government does contend here is that in the instant case, the evidence did not justify giving a lesser-included offense instruction. 
    In other words, there was no conflict as to this aggravating element. 
    And in urging this particular point, the government uses a very interesting play on words, particularly the word willfulness. 
    The government's claims that the elements of the Section 7201 felony are first a tax deficiency, secondly, some affirmative acts constituting an attempted evasion, and thirdly, willfulness, three elements, and the government points out that the elements of these 7207 misdemeanor are two-fold, one, the filing of a false return, which is the same as the affirmative act in the felony, and secondly, willfulness. 
    So the government concludes that willfulness is required in both the felony and the misdemeanor and willfulness is not the aggravating element which can escalate the misdemeanor to the felony, and the government claims that the tax deficiency is the thing that escalates the misdemeanor to the felony. 
    Now that's the aggravating element between 7207 and 7201. 
    And of course what this argument neatly assumes is the word willfulness, they assume that the word willfulness means the same thing in both statutes and nothing could be further from the truth, because as this court held in Spies case unequivocally and of course, as this language of the statute clearly expresses the term as willfulness as used in these two sections mean something completely different. 
    The term willfulness as used in the felony means one thing a specific intent to defeat or evade taxes. 
    Nothing less than that will suffice, and this court so held in the Spies case and reaffirmed in Holland versus United States and I think this is virtually beyond dispute, but in regard to Section 7207, the misdemeanor, the term willfulness simply means voluntarily, purposely, not accidentally. 
    In other words, as it was pointed out in speech, willfulness means different things depending on the context in which it is used and you just have to look at the statute in this case to find out which is which. 
    So in this instance, for a felony, you must have an intent to defeat or evade. 
    Nothing less will suffice for the misdemeanor of course you only have to have willfulness and so far as it pertains to be voluntary and not accidental character of filing a false return.

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    This is a jury question and this is all we wanted was to have this issue submitted to the jury. 
    Did this man intend to defeat or evade or did he just intend as he states in his confession that the government used, that he merely intended to put it off to a subsequent year. 
    If it's a just a same as the larceny, the famous larceny of the motor vehicle case as that. 
    The defendant gets on the stand and says I didn't intend to keep the car, I was only going out joy way. 
    So under that type of testimony, you have it issued that he intend to steal it, was the intent to permanently deprive the owner or was the just an unlawful use of a motor vehicle. 
    It does create a jury question which the jury -- we feel the defendants entitled had the jury instructed on. 
    So we feel that this question of willfulness to please the court is unquestionably the distinction, one of the distinctions between the felony and the misdemeanor. 
    And that if the willfulness amounts to an intent to defeat or evade then the crime which has been committed is a felony. 
    If the willfulness amounts to anything less than that, anything less than an intent to defeat and evade, then the only thing that the defendant has committed is a misdemeanor. 
    And in the instant case you just have to look at the confession itself, the thing that government relied on to prove intent in which he said I did not report it on my return, I did not intend to evade my taxes, I intended to pay them in a subsequent year. 
    You have to look no further than that to find out that the evidence in this very case, literally cried out for the lesser-included offense instructions which we here sought.

    Mr. Bender.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1794.338" stopTime="1907.037">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court. 
    At the outset I would like to – now ordering this exception which I think the petitioner has about our argument, we do not argue that the lesser-included offense doctrine has no application to income tax offence but that's not our position and it has never been our position. 
    The lesser included offence doctrine, we submit, is fully applicable to income tax offences in a proper case but we also agree as petitioner stated that these two misdemeanor offences involved in this case, section 7207 or 7203 are potentially applicable to income tax violations. The issue in the case as we see it, is whether this is a proper case for lesser included offence instructions, we submit that it is not a proper case but we do not take issue with the general proposition that lesser offence instructions are proper in income tax cases. 
    They are in proper cases. 
    They are not in this case because of the fact that lesser offence instructions are only proper under long course of decisions, going back at least to 1891, when there is some factual issue distinguishing the greater and the lesser offence that is where the jury could as petitioner in his brief case concedes, whether jury could rationally acquit the defendant of the greater offence but convict him of the lesser. 
    If that's true then we concede that in this case there should have been a lesser included defense instruction on any misdemeanor as to which that was true. 
    We do submit that that was not true in this case because under the evidence in this case it was rationally the impossible for jury to acquit the defendant of the felony charge while they convicted him of either one of the misdemeanors. 
    Now I -–

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1918.423" stopTime="2081.347">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Yes Mr. Justice, that I think is the crucial difference between us brought out by Mr. Justice White's question at the end of the argument. 
    Petitioner seems to say that you do not violate section 7201, if you have some intention at the time you file a false return to pay at a later time, that is a man willfully, fraudulently understates his income. 
    In this case, he understated his income by more than $20000, willfully, fraudulently understates his income on a return and submits the return -- we say and the cases hold, that when he does that, that is the completed offence of the income tax evasion, there is nothing ease to show. 
    Petitioner seems to say that it's a defense in a case like that if he can convince the jury, that in his mind, it was the intention some time in the future, 5 years, 10 years, he doesn't say how long in the future. 
    Some time in the future to make this good, I am not quite sure what petitioner argues would make this fraud good whether he would go back and reopen the 57 return, file an amended return same 5 years ago, I defrauded the government. 
    Now I wish to come clean and say that I withheld $20,000 income whether its that or whether he would simply add the income to later year, I don't think it to be the latter because that would clearly be innovation of the assessment of the tax on the 57 return. 
    In any case, we say that's clearly wrong, you do not show a defense to a prosecution for evasion by showing that you intended to pay in a later year. 
    If that were true for example, suppose 5 years after the filling of the fraudulent return, the taxpayer changes his mind and decides, well, he is gotten away with the 5 years, he now intends never to pay, when has he committed evasion at any time certainly on petitioner's theory, he didn't commit evasion when he filed a return because at that time he intended that somewhere it would come in the future pay. 
    I don't think, he would convince and commit the offensive evasion when he changed his intention because he would at that time commit no overt act and the law I think is clear that in order to commit evasion, you have to commit it overt act. 
    Another problem which would be raised aside from the problem of cheating the government, another problem which would be raised, it would be a problem of how the statutory limitations would apply to that theory but the statute in this offence is six years. 
    Suppose, for 6 years the taxpayer keeps in mind, this vague intention to pay, at the end of 6 years he changes his mind, he no longer ever intendeds to pay, the statute at run on the over act, the statute runs from the time of the overt act, we would never be able to prosecute. 
    We submit that it is simply impossible to read the statute for those reasons and on the plain face of the statute which –-

    We charge that the statement with regard to amount was false and that of course was an attempt to evade. 
    Suppose the proof raises some question as to whether or not the statement with regard to amount is true but it's fairly clear from the proof that the statement with regard to source is false.

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    In this case, I can't see any factors which would have to be added. 
    If the charged means of evasion is the filing of a false return as in this case, then, I don't think there would be a way of getting a lesser offense instruction. 
    It would have to be some other means of evasion alleged aside from the filing of a false return. 
    It's our submission that if you do deliberately file a false return, deliberately, fraudulently understating your income, that constitutes an evasion of tax. 
    So when the offense charged is the filing of the fraudulent return, so long as, excuse me, so long as the -- the fraud concerns the amount of the income, as I tried to say before there might be fraud, material fraud in a return which would not concern the amount of the income. 
    In such a case, if that was one of the charges and if that was part of the proof, then, a lesser-included offense instruction on Section 7207 wouldn't be proper.

    There is one other possible way of violating 7207 without violating 7201 and that would be if in -- suppose the taxpayer files a false return which understates the amount of income deliberately, at the same time, he also understates deductions which he has but he doesn't realize that he has the deductions. 
    The consequence is that there is no tax deficiency. 
    And we would take the position in that case that he would be violating 7207. 
    He's made a material false statement, even though there is no deficiency in that one evasion.

    As the 7203, the same analysis applies, in this case the a 7203 would only apply under the theory that he has not paid his tax not in this, the only way which he has not paid his tax in this case was to understate his tax liability. 
    If he did that willfully he committed the felony. 
    If he didn't do that willfully he didn't commit the felony and he also didn't violate 7203, because 7203 only implies when there is a willful failure to pay the tax. 
    For those reasons, we submit that under the circumstances of this case, because there is no factual difference between the instructions, because instructions, if the petitioner requested the court to get to the jury, it shows no factual way which the jury could rationally have acquitted the defendant of the felony and convicted him for the misdemeanor.

    Just a question when you intend to pay the tax? 
    When you intend to cheat the government either cheat it this year or next year? 
    And that depends on whether it is a felony or misdemeanor, if you intend to cheat it next year it's a felony, intend to cheat it this year it's a misdemeanor.

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    The Spies case in the first place holds that the while the government has conceded the point that tax evasion felony does include lesser offenses, but more important the Spies case holds specifically that the thing that distinguishes the felony from the misdemeanor is the tax evasion intent. 
    There must be an attempt, there must be some affirmative act which manifests an intent to defeat and evade taxes.

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    Absolutely not, the petitioner's testimony, his own testimony in the trial was based on this whole theory. 
    I would say that when the petitioner himself testified below he virtually confessed to 7207 prosecution. He said that he left this thing off his return, and he did it intentionally. 
    He thought, through a mistake, mistaken interpretation of law, could wait till he his other cost to ascertain the – but he virtually confessed to 7207 violation and but denied of course an intent to defeat or evade. 
    This is why we think that Lesser Offense Instruction was essential.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand it that way. 
    If you are right -- might there not be some problem about indictments, in these cases, an indictment to be good has to inform the defender that what he is charged with, and if any indictment only mentioned 7201 then he had to convict into something else. 
    You have a problem there, which you –-
speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="3774.133" stopTime="3807.509">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    I know because Federal rule 31C authorizes this -- this rule is not one just made for defendant, it's made for the government's preference too. 
    31C says you can be convicted of the offense charged or of any lesser offence included in the offence charged. 
    This is nothing new or strange for it's been in the law for hundreds of years, just the same way. 
    It's just like a first degree murder charge. 
    As any man charged indictment of the first degree murder can always be convicted of second degree murder, man slaughter with the indictment. 
    That's always saying here in so far --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3807.509" stopTime="3815.240">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But generally speaking it's good deal of body of law that says you can't be convicted for something under indictment.
speaker="merle_l_silverstein" startTime="3815.240" stopTime="3832.252">
    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    That's correct, unless it's included in the offence.Now we -- I have not spent any time here because it's adequately covered in our brief and the government concedes it and that is affected that these two Lesser Offences are unquestionably included in this particular charge.

    Mr. Merle L. Silverstein 
    They made their prima-facie case when they introduced their confession in their evidence, and I would say from then on it's the matter of the defense to rebut their prima-facie case and negate the intent or the presumption of intent that they proved.

    That's right because the burden never switches -- that's true. 
    But I say, the government met their burden, at least prima-facie, then of course we have the burden of going forward with the evidence charge, we thought it.
