    This petition for certiorari before this Court results from another instance of the use and abuse of criminal process by a state to acquire any cause for conviction of the defendant or an alleged criminal charge, a Negro, defendant then whose engagement in Civil Rights activities and whose associational -- and whose associations are not here related to this case. 
    A conviction that is based on a record that has -- is so fraught with errors and fundamental denials as due process that if anyone of the basis which I intend to discuss are not sufficient. 
    The cumulative effect is a sufficient basis for reversal of this case. 
    We have then the decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversing that judgment followed by the suggestion of error of the Attorney General which again points out the association now with petitioner's counsel and the reason I mentioned this is because I think that it has culminated and that which appears on page 13 and 14 of the state's brief, in the guise of seeking relief which the state knows it cannot get here and it would be improper to receive here, it has included this matter and I don't think that it need be dignified by any further discussions, but I would call it to the attention of this Court.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On the other hand, Mrs Morris is there anything in the record to show that -- to support your preliminary statements here to the Court that this is a persecution of this person because of this affidavit?
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="189.782" stopTime="485.169">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    I think there is. 
    I think that it points to that and I will make record references as I go on to it. 
    You will recall as far as the facts are concerned that the first description of a Negro driving big black car, given by the complaining witness and which appears in the -- that portion of the transcripts, 158 and 159 which is the original statement of the complainant, where the party was asked that -- when were a party advised them that the person driving the car was involved in discussed segregation, his statement, and I would read it to the Court, is they knew who I was talking about right away, he said he was involved with NACP or something and the same theme prevails this case throughout it and I don't think that it is of -- not in the sense of importance. 
    I don't think this is glaring as some of the other errors here, but I think that this last issue, I think demanded that it be raised. 
    Apart from the conduct of the investigation in which whatever original statement the complaining witness made never appeared because there was no original affidavit. 
    And I think the clarification that there was a tailoring considering the difference between the writ use of the complaining witness's original description of what happened and his final testimony at trial, so that the defendant -- a crime was made the fit the defendant ultimately. 
    There was an illegal arrest. 
    It was a denial of a right to subpoenas where there is supposed to be a compulsory right of process. 
    There was a refusal of the Court to desegregate the courtroom. 
    The attitude of the Court is clear from the record, the addressing of Negroes' by their first name. 
    Finally, conviction of a Court lacking jurisdiction and the major point in this case which is the conviction of the defendant on illegally seized evidence. 
    First, reversed by the Court below and then affirmed by the Court below which admits that this evidence was in fact illegally obtained so that, that issue was not here. 
    I would like to devote myself to the jurisdictional question because I think it could be built within less time, if this Court permits. 
    It's elementary to the Court of Mississippi because it so states that trial by a Court lacking jurisdiction is a fundamental denial of due process. 
    It also raises Fourteenth Amendment issues, that under the statute of Mississippi and Justice of the Peaces or jurisdiction begins with the lodging of an affidavit and that's in accordance with 1832 of the statutes. 
    In accordance with 1205, he is required to send all original papers to the Trial Court, and in accordance with 1200, he is required to certify that, that record is the original record. 
    In this instance, the petitioner was arrested on March 3, 1962. 
    He was held overnight in jail until March the 4th. 
    On March the 14th he had a hearing before the Justice of the Peace whereupon he was convicted. 
    The only affidavit in the county court, the trial court, whose jurisdiction is dependent upon that of the Justice of the Peace's Court, was an affidavit filed by the county attorney dated March the14th which neither reflect that it was on information and belief. 
    Now, obviously put, it had been on personal knowledge. 
    So that under the Law of Mississippi even consistent with that part of it that as mentioned in the opinion of the court below, the Court lacked jurisdiction. 
    It did not decide the jurisdictional question. 
    Actually what it did was define an amended affidavit and in finding an amended affidavit based on certain representations of counsel which were not confident testimony. 
    It did so in violation of its own law which has specific requirements for amendment. 
    The first of which is that an original be produced or the individual who supplied the original before whom it was executed and who supplied the contents in answer to a complaint, testified to it from personal knowledge. 
    By some processes of invalid reasoning the opinion of the Court below requires petitioner to prove the jurisdiction of the Court to which he continually objected, so that we raise this not only on the due process grounds, but also that the reading of the law and application of the Law in Mississippi which is in violation of it's own statues, is a denial of equal protection of the laws.

    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    The Mississippi Supreme Court has said that there was an amended affidavit in this case upon which it rested. 
    The jurisdictional question itself was never specifically adjudicated. 
    The point I am trying to make that the termination of an amended affidavit apart from not being supported by the record is not consistent with its own laws. 
    It is not consistent with its own statutes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="535.240" stopTime="537.690">

    There are cases -- all cases wherever amendments have been allowed, it required original affidavits. 
    There is -- this is a thorough research of Mississippi law. 
    The only case where it has not, the Court has required that the person before whom the affidavit was made testified to its execution and to the facts that -- as to the facts set forth therein.

speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="621.278" stopTime="745.298">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    Yes, it is. 
    Now, finally, the Supreme Court of Mississippi at first reversed the conviction of the petitioner conceding that there had in fact been an illegal search and seizure under the Mississippi Constitution. 
    But that because the testimony wherein the illegally seized evidence was brought into the record it was not objected to a the specific time that it was brought into the record. 
    Despite this procedural rule that they talk about, there was a denial of fundamental fairness to the petitioner and I'm talking about this first opinion by virtue with the fact that this evidence was the only corroborating evidence to the testimony of the complaining witness upon -- following the suggestion of error of the Attorney General. 
    It was through the first opinion and filed that second which is in the record of which where it consistently held the search to be illegal. 
    It went on to determine that it had a procedural rule requiring that your objection be made at the time that evidence is submitted. 
    It departed from its former opinion only that it introduced the element of waiver and it stated, it starts on page 243 and continues to 244. 
    Now, since the defendant did not object to the introduction of the illegally obtained evidence at the time it was offered he had waived his right to object to such evidence and that error could not be predicated upon it.

    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    The difference in the cases in Mississippi, and they differ from those that are cited in the opinion below, is that where they have adjudicated fundamental right to constitutional questions they have applied the same rule and it would be consistent with rule applied in the Federal Court that where there was plain error or where the conviction is supported by the illegal evidence, where the constitutional and infirmity is the basis the whole basis for the conviction then it has reversed in instances where the objection was made at the end of the case, where the objection was made -- where no objection was raised at all, and where --

speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="831.731" stopTime="857.551">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    I'm trying to argue -- the question that put me actually ahead of myself, I'm arguing this on two basis. 
    First, that as opposed to an independent adequate state ground that none exists in this case because first it's not independent. 
    We're dealing with primarily a federal issue which I haven't had time to devote any time to yet and secondly, this long procedural rule that they talk about does not exist. 
    So --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="857.551" stopTime="885.403">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm sorry. 
    I realized we're all -- oh, yeah it's pretty hard to be -- there are a string of citations of Mississippi decisions at the top of page 244 on the record that you just referred us to as to, which are cited in support of this rule which you now tell us doesn't exist and I assume therefore, you're telling us that these cases don't stand for the proposition to which they're cited? 
    I haven't read the case yet.
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="885.403" stopTime="904.147">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    I have, and they are referred to in our brief at length.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="904.147" stopTime="906.287">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I wouldn't want you to do that. 
    I just wanted to just generally --
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="906.287" stopTime="952.161">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    Yeah, generally, I can say that they are distinguishable on three basis. 
    There are those cases that deal with the question of probable cause, where probable cause had to be determined and which the Court under its own opinion says is the reason for that rule, it's a procedural rule so that the trial won't be interrupted. 
    There are those cases where the objection was applied on non-constitutional basis where the objection went to the use of rebuttal testimony to incompetent testimony. 
    There are only two cases in Mississippi where there's a constitutional violation clear on the record where there is no need for any probable cause determination and that is Brooks and Henry versus State.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="952.161" stopTime="957.177">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Miss Morris, you may continue your argument.
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="957.177" stopTime="1085.375">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Court. 
    I'd like to clarify exactly what our contention is in this regard so that we don't be -- so that we are held to abandon either a due process or an equal protection argument. 
    It is our contention then in this case, the objection made was timely and apart from federal law which I hope to reach but may not, that is was timely under Mississippi law. 
    Although, it occurred in a motion or directed verdict and I would refer the Court to page 113 of the record where I'd like to state exactly what was said. 
    Secondly, we contend that the warrant having been issued and the testimony of this Mr. Collins on the stand to the effect that after he had placed this man under arrest he then proceeded to go and search his car and clearly, this is a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. 
    And it is unlawful search and seizure, so the evidence that they have secured against this defendant is illegal and unlawful. 
    That in such a motion for a judgment of acquittal, implicit in which is the fact that there is not sufficient competent evidence to go to the jury, when does this timely objection of the Mississippi law which is stated by the Court below in its opinion on page 243. 
    It has been a long established procedural rule in the State that parties prejudiced by the introduction of inadmissible evidence are required to object to its admissibility at the time it is offered so that the trial judge may determine its admissibility before it is submitted to the jury. 
    The purpose of this rule is in essence the same as the Federal Rule. 
    It connotes an orderly trial, but the purposes stated by the Court below is so that it will go -- it will not go to the jury before the question is determined. 
    This was raised before the case was submitted to the jury. 
    Even though it was raised in the form as a directed verdict and I think it clearly objects to the type of evidence used.

    I think initially a directed verdict, but a motion to disregard would have taken care of that point alone, because our contention that without that evidence, the remainder of the evidence was sufficient. 
    So, we would have been looking for a directed verdict, but it took the place of a motion to strike. 
    This was testimonial evidence. 
    This was not a case where somebody brings in Exhibit A and says, I offer this material evidence in and do you object to it? 
    This is something that can be only elicited during the course of testimony and until the police chief actually got to the point where he talked about something that he discovered in the car which was somewhat along in his description of how the thing occurred there was no time to object and there was no notice on the part of counsel as to what was coming.

    What was the testimony of it? 
    I thought he testifies to that. 
    He testified that he's in the car, he testified that he recognized the defendants, seen the parties, he admitted to that. 
    Is that true?
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="1391.484" stopTime="1415.584">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    He testified as to exactly how it was done, but the point I'm trying to make is the point for an objection in and as I colloquy developed could not be pinpointed until he got to the point where he had discovered something. 
    If he just got in and out of the car, we don't have any illegal search and seizure because to our knowledge we don't have any evidence. 
    For all we knew at that point he got in and out of the car. 
    I'm talking --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1415.584" stopTime="1468.499">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that's not my point. 
    You said a moment ago -- now you said it was not sufficient evidence on which conviction could have been had without adding the chewing gum and wrap around to the fact that the neither you were [Inaudible]. 
    I was just wondering, which page is find the testimonies, the reason why I have read this reference that reads the plaintiff [Inaudible] and picked up and get him a ride and it was [Inaudible] identified this party as defendant was being remanded from the act, is that lead sufficient?
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="1468.499" stopTime="1495.038">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    Apart from the facts which lead to that and pertaining to that directly is our contention that it would not, because under Mississippi laws, as was pointed out in their first opinion which I realized was withdrawn and I shall deal with it in a minute. 
    The Court considered that testimony insufficient because it was not collaborated. 
    Now, the trial court apparently was the same opinion, but it -- because it charged the jury in accordance with the laws of Mississippi to the same effect.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1495.038" stopTime="1502.094">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He also had the number of car, did they get it? 
    He testified to all of that?
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="1502.094" stopTime="1522.825">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    He testified to all of that, that of course would have to be compared with his original statement which would be the tape recorded statement taken by the County Prosecutor Pearson and on a comparative basis to realize from the record how some very general details began to be explicit testimony, which doesn't detract from the fact that that testimony is on the record.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1522.825" stopTime="1553.531">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The other thing that appeared me that, that was corroboration, it was ceded that it was determined in records that it was found [Inaudible] and the back [Inaudible] corroboration of course. 
    Corroboration if this was a car [Inaudible] and also that car was owned by the defendant.
speaker="barbara_a_morris" startTime="1553.531" stopTime="1588.443">
    Ms. Barbara A. Morris 
    Corroborate -- the case was based on identity as the Court below observed. 
    The Court below also observed that up until then his testimony was fairly general and it was only this evidence which could support his statement which apparently did not consider insufficient and which we urge is insufficient and as I say the Court below in its instructions charged that without this corroborating testimony it wouldn't be insufficient. 
    So these represent the Law of Mississippi apart from anything else.

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First on the subject to the affidavit, you will find the statement in the record and it's repeated in the opinion of the State Supreme Court and I make note of it on page 9, I believe it is 9, at the top of the page there a very short brief to the effect that the defendant's attorney admitted that an amended affidavit was properly substituted for the original. 
    Now, that having been done, naturally there was no question raised along the route anywhere about the whereabouts of the original affidavit. 
    I'm going to proceed here from if it just please the Court. 
    After conviction as appeal in a trial de novo and these books certified to the county or the Circuit Court as the case maybe, all the papers that it has in the thing and in this case, they only certified up the amended affidavit the one upon which it was tried and very logically so and understandably so. 
    And when they started looking for the original affidavit nobody could find it. 
    But he was tried on the amended affidavit which was furnished to counsel which was taken by them and which they agreed had been substituted for the original. 
    So that amended affidavit even if there were no other or even if it were faulty give it to full jurisdiction. 
    Admittedly, there was an unlawful search of this petitioner's car by the chief police of Clarksdale, Mississippi, after the petitioner had been put in jail and the complaining witness had related his story in order to nail down the evidence so to speak. 
    The Chief Police went to the petitioner's home. 
    His wife came to the door and he asked her could he look in his car. 
    The car was locked and she went in and got the key, gave him the key and she and her mother and father and her daughter, I think about nine years old came out there and they watched as the chief police unlocked the car and looked in and corroborated to him operable condition of the cigarette lighter the complaining witness had told about. 
    He had also stored about two ash trays up there, one on the driver's side and one on the passenger's side, and the one on passenger's side had a lot of red chewing gum wrappers. 
    Well sure enough the chief reaches over and it had bunch of empty chewing gum wrappers and he says what is this? 
    And there his little daughter speaks up and says, oh, I put those at Wednesday, I believe she said. 
    It is strongly corroborated of the mere fact that the boy was in the car with the petitioner. 
    It's not essential to his conviction I believe that Mr. Justice Clark mentioned that the testimony of the boy himself being sufficient. 
    But, of course, this corroborate help.

    Yeah, neither rule for me --
speaker="g_garland_lyell_jr" startTime="1892.023" stopTime="2097.892">
    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    The Supreme Court just observed that the trail court made a concession to the appellant to which he was not entitled, I had forgotten that. 
    Any lawyer that has had any trial experience knows very well that when your opposition is about to introduce something prejudicial and inadmissible in conflict for any reason, that at some way in the proceedings either in some states or in Federal Court by a free trial motion to suppress or by an objection at the time the testimony is offered, that to preserve the point on appeal, one of those those steps has to be taken. 
    No objection was made. 
    I apologize to the Court for something I felt I had to do in this case. 
    I've made an exhibit to the brief an affidavit to the District Attorney who prosecuted this case. 
    As to what happened in the courtroom, and I feel that while affidavits have no part in a brief before this Court. 
    I feel that I'm justified in this -- the light of this particular case and for the additional reason that I have three times given counsel for this petitioner an opportunity to claim ignorance of the fact that they didn't have to make some timely [Inaudible] objection. 
    I believe, I've made a part of this record the brief that I filed in the Mississippi Supreme Court on subjection of error. 
    The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed his conviction because of the non [Inaudible] attorneys, who were down there defending him. 
    At the same time, completely -- well, in fact that he had a resident attorney with vast trial and appellate experience. 
    He also had that Robert L. Carter, who is well known to this Court, John Sandifer of New York, and the Supreme Court excused their failure to object because they were non-residents and not familiar with the technique of criminal trials in Mississippi. 
    Well, the obvious effect on that -- of that in future cases is momentous. 
    It wouldn't paid the defendant in Mississippi, who wouldn't pay and hire a Mississippi lawyer import one that didn't know what he was doing and you get an automatic reversible. 
    So, I finally suggested there furnished all nine members of the Court with a copy of it and they unanimously sustained it and reinstated the rule that you got to make the timely [Inaudible] objection and furthermore in this case, the defendant had put on similar testimony that the principle of estoppel work. 
    You will note in that affidavit and the -- to say you justified it to herein situation. 
    In that suggestion wherever that filed concluded by offering to withdraw it or confess it to the Mississippi Court of Right. 
    If either one of those lawyers, not all of them, but either one of them would file a simple affidavit that he didn't know that if sometime in the proceedings either by free trial motion or by objection one offered, I would confess that the Court is right.

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    It should be the rule of the Federal Court that where one side introduces it as evidence either in a civil or criminal case which is incompetent and inadmissible for some reason, but no objections made and then the other side, when they put on their case going to the same matter as were done in this case, this inadmissible evidence was a testimony of the Chief of Police as to what he found in the car, the inoperable cigarette lighter and the chewing gum wrappers. 
    I believe petitioner's wife on direct examination by the defense was also asked about what was found in the car? 
    They said, [Inaudible] and they put a garage mechanic on to testify with respect to petitioner bringing the lighter down to his place to have it fixed which indicated to me that this was definite strategy that they knew what the stated -- the cigarette lighter pretty much, and then later to disprove it by showing the petitioner had taken it down and had it fixed.

    I like to devote myself to this. 
    I think I'm going to have to limit these things raised. 
    You had us to go first. 
    I didn't have time to mention that on direct, but on page 237 that finding that there is a proper substitution in the -- of the affidavit with regard to the jurisdictional point, is not supported by the record and we would refer the Court, the testimony regarding that which is on 156 and 157 of the record, proper and we contend here that, that finding was not supported by the evidence. 
    As a matter of fact, the record refutes that it was proper and the Court entered that word proper. 
    Secondly counsel has urged that there was an agreement as to substitution of this amended affidavit. 
    I think there were about eight or nine objections made to that amended affidavit. 
    They are consistent throughout the record and appear on 53, 54, 56, 62, 63, 65, 66, 112, and 182 of the record. 
    So, I think that substantially takes care of that.
