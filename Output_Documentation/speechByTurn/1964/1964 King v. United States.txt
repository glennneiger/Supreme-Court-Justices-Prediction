    Mr. David S. Bate 
    Pardon. 
    The point that the petitioners wish to emphasize on oral argument is point four in the petitioner's brief and the only point which the brief of the United States gives any emphasis to at all. 
    The point is that the court below ordered Mr. King, the distributing agent to distribute as he did. 
    He had no other duty by his orders than to distribute as he was told. 
    The Government's claim was a priority claim but it was not liquidated, it further was disputed at the time that the Court made its order of distribution. 
    This action is against King as a distributing agent only. 
    It is not against him in any other capacity. 
    Therefore this order that we are speaking of is the only order that is important that the only -- this principle fact that is important. 
    Mr. King is not being sued here or charge in any other capacity. 
    He was obliged to and he did follow orders. 
    He is not like therefore like a trustee in bankruptcy, an executor and assignee for the benefit of creditors that is one who examines claims and advices the Court and then distributes as either before -- without the court order or as the Court directs. 
    He certainly is not as the trustees in bankruptcy, the assignees or the executors that are incited in the cases in the Government's brief. 
    He is not a person as all those are who has distributed either without prior Court order or in -- yes without prior court order who never -- were obliged to get a court order at all.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did you raise it in your brief though?
speaker="david_s_bate" startTime="264.933" stopTime="457.118">
    Mr. David S. Bate 
    We've raised it in our brief. 
    Your Honor, the reason that we raised this in our brief and I will address myself immediately to that. 
    Initially this case was a case of simple -- simply the case of whether King should be liable where he had followed the orders of the Court. 
    In the complaint, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the complaint say that King distributed -- he distributed a $160,000 as distributing agent. 
    Then they go on to say this was in violation of Section 192. 
    In the answer which the defendant made in that case, we said that King followed explicitly the orders of the Court and therefore shouldn't be liable. 
    On this narrow issue, we preceded to the District Court. 
    In the District Court, we had a stip -- a -- well, first of all we had a pretrial conference. 
    Then there was a stipulation of fact. 
    In both the pretrial conference and the stipulation of fact, the -- absolutely the only issue was whether King as a distributing agent who distributed under orders of the Court was liable. 
    We reached the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    We -- and the -- there, we -- the Court found that there -- reversed Judge Wortendyke in the District Court and stated that that -- well, several things. 
    First of all they indicated that although Crocker and Stephens which are the two cases in conflict. 
    And by reason of which I believe this Court took cognizance of this case. 
    They said although in the -- the Third Circuit opinion, they said although these cases are helpful, they're not determinative. 
    And then they found -- they made some statements such as that there was -- that negligence in the case at bar is apparent. 
    Then Judge Biggs who is writing the opinion of the Court, said -- made a further statement, the equities are not with King in this case. 
    It seemed to us from this opinion that we had gone entirely off the subject of the initial District Court opinion and the findings of that Court as well as the stipulation of facts as well as the complaint. 
    We felt that the Third Circuit Court was trying to hold Mr. King on some other basis and possibly raise him from the stature of a distributing agent. 
    We -- so that at that point, we went back to the statutes and the cases and dug into them much more deeply and try to read these -- the cases that have been interpreted 191 and 192. 
    And we did bring up these other issues.I do not propose to argue them here Your Honor unless you wish me to.

    There is no statement anywhere in the complaint or in the stipulation that this statement made by Mr. Freeman wasn't accurate. 
    He wasn't a very well respected member of the Bar of the State of New Jersey.

    Mr. David S. Bate 
    We don't know that but Your Honor what we do know is that that -- and from this of course an inference could be drawn but we -- that -- that's -- there wasn't. 
    We do know that some -- that beside what was left in the $6000 at the end of the distribution which the Government took, there was also some $6000 received by the United States from the debtor corporation. 
    This is stated in the complaint itself. 
    But Your Honor the point that we're -- that I'm trying to make here is that we were not apprised that this was an accusation being made against Mr. King or Mr. Freeman that this was a false statement. 
    And if it had been so for Mr. King was alive when this complaint was filed, he died shortly after the complaint was filed but that would -- I think six or eight months after he died in January of 1959, I think it was. 
    But he is -- as he was alive and he could have defended -- we at the time, the initial complaint was made. 
    Also Mr. Freeman was alive at that time of the stipulation of fact. 
    No accusation that this statement of his was false had ever been made at -- he is now deceased also.

    And everybody was aware on this colloquy in order to (Inauidble) that a claimed would be filed. 
    (Inauidble) is true that the dispatch (Inauidble), initially he chooses the money and the referee sounds as if that (Inauidble).

    Of the $160,000 not enough was left to pay the claim of the United States. 
    But no statement was ever made as to what became of the $94,000. 
    We were not put on proof as to what happened to that. 
    And if Your Honor will note that at the end of the -- that this case against us comes up in 1958. 
    And the case against the -- that -- or the point of time that we're really interested in is March 21, 1947, 11 years has elapsed.

    Mr. David S. Bate 
    Yes Your Honor, that is exactly what the -- our position is. 
    That the -- that he is taken out of this -- the only issue before us is whether King as a distributing agent can be liable but I do feel that there is involved here the question of good faith or bad faith but not because it was raised in the District Court, because it was not raised there. 
    There was no -- nothing from which we knew that there was a question of bad faith or negligence in the complaint or in the stipulation of fact or in the District Court's opinion. 
    And Judge Wortendyke in one point, he cites In re Pollak. 
    Now In re Pollak was a case in which the -- Judge Wortendyke said In re Pollak relied on by the Government is distinguishable from Stephens and from the case at bar because the distributing agent met -- in Pollak made the payments which depleted upon without proper court order. 
    Now then came -- then he goes on and say -- cites the other case of -- that involved the distributing agent. 
    The only other case cited in the briefs and that was In re Empire Shoe and after that he says that there the agent was held liable where he had acted without fraud. 
    Now it seemed to me that Mr. -- that Judge Wortendyke if he had thought there was fraud misrepresentation or bad faith, or any of these things that are now being brought up as issues, he would have said right there. 
    He said that -- he would have said something to that effect but he does not. 
    He negatives bad faith. 
    And we had all along been under the impression that we were dealing with a -- with the issue that Mr. Justice Harlan has said we were dealing with just now which is the simple issue of whether a distributing agent can be liable where he is -- where the referee knew all about this thing, knew it was disputed, knew it was unliquidated and he knew that or thought that was -- there was sufficient money to pay it and there's no proof that there wasn't.

   Argument of Alan S. Rosenthal
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1950.962" stopTime="1952.671">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rosenthal.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="1952.671" stopTime="2107.167">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As we understand it on the faces of the petitioner's argument this morning, they recognized that the first, the second, and third questions which were presented in their brief in the merits, not properly before this Court because they were not raised in the petition for certiorari or indeed in either of the courts below. 
    For that reason if the Court pleases, I will confine myself to the single question which is properly before this Court as having been raised in the petition for certiorari, and having been an issue in the courts below. 
    That question if the Court pleases is whether a distributing agent appointed in a Chapter 11 arrangement, who fails to honor the Government's debt priority under Section 191, subjects himself to personal liability under Section 192 for the amount of the Government's indebtedness that was entitled priority. 
    Now the question as it arises in the context of this case breaks down into two parts. 
    The first part is the part to which Mr. Justice Harlan referred. 
    Namely, are fiduciaries of this type called in this case the distributing agent, are fiduciaries of this type within the reach of Section 192 at all. 
    Now then on this question, there is concededly a conflict between the circuits. 
    And indeed it is because of this conflict that the United States acquiesces in the petition and presumably it was because of this conflict that this Court granted certiorari. 
    The second question is, assuming that distributing agents, this type of fiduciary, comes within the range or reach of Section 192 is that the defense in an action of this kind that the distribution made by the fiduciary was pursuant to a Court approved order. 
    Now it is the position, if the Court pleases, of the United States first that as the court below held Section 192 does reach fiduciaries such as Mr. King. 
    And secondly that in the circumstances of this case, admitted circumstances of this case, it is no defense that Mr. King's payments were under a plan of distribution which had ben approved by the referee.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2107.167" stopTime="2115.988">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    (Inaudible) in this case then you -- I take it you -- that explains the Government to me that now they'd had bear it?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="2115.988" stopTime="2174.704">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Your Honor, we would suggest this. 
    And that is that if the plan of arrangement is approved by the referee, first with full knowledge of the fact that there is a priority claim in the picture. 
    And second, with the United States having been given notice by the debtor or by the distributing agent of the fact that this plan arrangement is being considered for confirmation. 
    If then the Court or the referee were to disregard the Government's priority with full knowledge of the existence of the priority, and with the full opportunity to the United States to defend this priority claim before the referee in that limited of circumstances, we've indicated in our brief, we would concede that the distributing agent would not be liable for executing the Court's orders.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2174.704" stopTime="2176.784">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    That's the position you made in page 26 of your --
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="2176.784" stopTime="2475.613">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That is correct Your Honor. 
    Now that is quite a different case from that which is presented here. 
    I might point out that the Bankruptcy Act itself in Chapter 11 specifically makes provision for priority claims. 
    Section 337 for example provides that the debtor shall deposit the money necessary to pay all debts which have priority. 
    Section 367 (2) provides that upon confirmation of the arrangement, the money which the debtor has deposited for priority debts shall be dispersed to the persons entitled thereto. 
    So there is a contemplation in the Act itself that the debtor as a condition proceeding to the approval of his plan of arrangement shall deposit the moneys which are necessary to pay off priority claims and upon confirmation of the arrangements, those claims will be paid properly. 
    Now the order which appointed Mr. King in this case, which appears at page 11 of the record, directed the debtors. 
    This is the corporation of which Mr. King was the president to deposit with Mr. King the moneys necessary to pay all debts which have priority. 
    So this was of course executing the provisions of Section 337. 
    Now what happened in this case was the plan of arrangement, amended plan of arrangement, came on for confirmation and at that point the referee raised the matter of this priority claim of the United States. 
    And as the Court has noted itself, Mr. Freeman, the counsel for the debtor, specifically stated that there would be at all times $94,000 available to pay that claim. 
    Now the referee has stated, and this can be found on page 16 of the record, that the confirmation on his part was conditioned upon a provision or payment of the Government's claim if allowable up to $94,000, this was pursuant to what Mr. Freeman had stated. 
    The result of it here is that there was a plain violation by Mr. King of his duty. 
    When he drew up these checks and presented them to the referee for countersigning without having seen to it that the debt of the United States was protected as Mr. Freeman has stated it would be. 
    But we would say here tat the game that the issue of knowledge, the issue of whether or not there has been plans with the order that would come in again only in the context of whether a -- it is a defense that there was a court order under which the payments had been made. 
    And again we would say there that it is only a defense in the limited circumstance where the referee has been advised of the priority. 
    When he entered the order, he's aware of the actual state of affairs and where he chooses to -- the reasons best known to himself, not to honor the referee that is, not to honor the Government's priority and honoring his order, and the United States as I say, has had notice and has an opportunity to convince the referee. 
    Now the really basic question that we think that is before the Court is the question which is presented by the question rather which relates to the coverage of Section 192 itself. 
    Does Section 192 extend to fiduciaries such as Mr. King? 
    Now it's the Government's position stated that the court below was quite correct in rejecting the position as we understand it of the petitioners that Section 192 does not reach a court appointed fiduciary unless he is one of the court appointed -- types of court appointed fiduciaries or designated ao nominee in Section 192 itself. 
    Now we think that the starting point in any discussion of the reach of Section 192 must be this Court's consistent recognition that Section 192 is (Inaudible) with Section 191. 
    As the Court is aware, both of these Sections date back to the early days of the republic and manifest the firmly rooted legislative interest in securing and protecting the public revenues. 
    As such, this Court has held that both Sections are to be liberally construed to effectuate their objectives not only Section 191 which establishes the Government's debt priority but also Section 192 which subjects to personal liability any person who pays the debtor's debts in disregard of it.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, I assume Your Honor that if there was a -- if it could be established by the United States that the payment by Mr. King to himself was fraudulent, then the United States would have a remedy. 
    But in most of these cases, I doubt that the question of fraud could -- the issue of fraud could be established by the United States. 
    Here for example, there's no contest that Mr. King was a creditor of the United States. 
    The question here as in most of these cases is whether or not or -- wasn't the absence of any fraud. 
    The claim of the United States is going to be satisfied first as the statute directs that it shall be satisfied if it is entitled priority.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2550.074" stopTime="2555.333">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Your view of the statute naturally gives you an easier case on this.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="2555.333" stopTime="2793.265">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, we would submit if the Court pleases that in -- that the position that the petitioners take here is that there is an entire class of fiduciaries, namely these fiduciaries who have court appointments and are not designated ao nominee in 192 or outside the reach of the statute. 
    Now that would mean that there's a whole class of priority debts of United States which have no protection in the absence of a -- at least of the Government's being able to establish fraud. 
    Now we think that the argument of the petitioners which does derives support from the Fifth Circuit's decision in United States against Stephens that there is this class of fiduciaries who were outside the ambit of the Act cannot even be squared with the language of Section 192 even if it were to be assumed that this language were to be taken in a vacuum divorced from the legislative purpose. 
    Section 192 applies to every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person who pays any debt due by the person or state for whom or who which he acts. 
    Now as this Court noted in the Bramwell case, this language is very general. 
    And it said the generality of it before any person insignificant. 
    Now, a receiver or distributing agent in this case -- in the context of this case Mr. King is plainly a person who pays the debts of another. 
    And in doing so, we respectfully submit he is acting in the most meaningful sense for the debtor. 
    Mr. King, we would say was acting clearly on behalf of the debtor corporation in paying its debts in accordance with the plan of distribution which the corporation has prepared. 
    Now it's quite true whereas the petitioner's stress that in discharging their functions, a distributing agent or receiver as it was involved in the Stephens case, maybe an officer armed with the Court because he's acting under a court appointment, and additionally is the custodian of property which is under the supervision of the Court. 
    And we don't think it follows that for the purpose of Section 192 that a fiduciary is to be regarded as actig for the Court rather than for the debtors merely because of his status as the Court or appointee. 
    And in support of that argument, we don't think we need to go beyond the fact that the administrators are designated ao nominee in Section 192 as being persons who pay the debts of the state for whom they act. 
    And of course, the Court well knows the administrator coming with a -- Mr. King or a receiver is an officer -- is appointed by the Court and as such is an officer of the Court. 
    Apart from the terms of the Section, we would say that the construction that the petitioner offers cannot squarely or cannot be squared rather with the underlying legislative purpose. 
    I would just point out in that connection that under this construction, there must be imputed to Congress on a petitioner's construction an intent to give a higher dignity to the Government's priority claims against the proceedings of states, insolvent proceedings of the states then against as here an insolvent corporation. 
    That follows from the fact that where you have an insolvent proceedings. 
    He invariably will have an administrator or an executor who are designated ao nominee and therefore within the reach of 192. 
    On the other hand, as the petitioner views it, where you're having insolvent corporation anytime that the fiduciary is other than one of the classes of the fiduciaries designated ao nominee and is in addition a court appointee, there's no protection afforded by 192 at all.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No Your Honor, on the -- we would not think it would make any difference.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    -- the class. 
    Now on the second phase of the case, that is whether or not the court approval provides immunization from liability. 
    We would say that that fact alone that he had no contact would make no difference. 
    It would still be his duty we submit, to make an inquiry into whether there are any priority claims. 
    Now if there -- if we were dealing with a distributing agent who had nothing to do with the corporation, and the corporation feel from him the fact that there was an actual or potential priority claim of the United States in the picture, then I would suppose the distributing agent, the stranger in the position of distributing agent might be relieved of liability. 
    We would say here that these particular facts of this case with this distributing agent who is the president of the debtor corporation put forth the plan of arrangement, that these merely reinforced the fact that in the circumstances of this case, there was a breach of the duty which was owed, the referee, in which would owe the United States on the part of the distributing agent. 
    For these reasons if the Court pleases, we respectfully submit that the judgment below should be affirmed.
