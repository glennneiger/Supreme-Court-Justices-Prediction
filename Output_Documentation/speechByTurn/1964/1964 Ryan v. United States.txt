Ryan v. United States

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justice of the Court, this case involves an interpretation of an act of Congress which relates to examinations and investigations of taxpayers by the Commissioner and his agents. 
    The particular part of the act of Congress with which we are concerned states restrictions on examination of taxpayers. 
    No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigation. 
    And only one inspection of the taxpayer's books or accounts shall be made for each taxable year, unless the Secretary or his delegate after investigation notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary. 
    The precise question concerned here is whether this act of Congress, this section of the statute, requires that an internal revenue agent should establish to the satisfaction of the District Court that a reasonable basis suggest for a suspicion of fraud or probable cause exist to believe the taxpayer was guilty of fraud in order to justify the enforcement of a summons issued by the agent to the taxpayer to produce his books and records and testify for years which are barred by all statutes of limitations and open only in the event of fraud. 
    The facts in this case are that the taxpayer, Bayard Edward Ryan of Maysville, Kentucky filed timely his federal income tax returns for the years 1942 to 1953 inclusive, and reported a sizable amount of income for those years. 
    An examination began by a revenue agent of the Commissioner sometime in 1960 of the returns for 1954 to 1958. 
    At the time I believe of the hearing in the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, the case for the years 1954 to 1958 had been settled. 
    The agent thereupon began investigation of the years 1942 to 1953 and issued a summons requiring the taxpayer to produce the records for those years and to appear and testify.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, when we stopped I had stated that the taxpayer had received the summons from the revenue agent and he appeared -- but did not produce his books on the advice of counsel on the basis that the assessment of the taxes had been barred by all statutes of limitations except by fraud and he requested on the advice of counsel that some indication be made of the existence of fraud. 
    Thereupon a complaint was filed in the District Court, in the Eastern District of Kentucky, and the agent alleged that the taxpayer had the books and records for the years 1942 to 1953 in his possession and that the agent had made an estimate of the network assets of the taxpayer and therefore there was a strong suspicion of fraud. 
    The basis apparently of the complaint was that the examination was relevant and material through his examinations for the years involved, 1942 to 1953. 
    The taxpayer filed an answer alleging that the books and records for all the years involved were not in existence and that neither were the filed income tax returns in view of the fact that the Congress itself ever so often orders the destruction of individual income tax returns. 
    The trial was held in the District Court and the District Court took the position and made the ruling that there was an automatic and arbitrary right of the agent to have the books and records of the taxpayer for the years 1942 to 1953 irrespective of fraud. 
    He held that fraud was not a matter of concern because the statute 7602, gave the agent the automatic right to any books and records. 
    At the trial of the case however, it was showed that -- it was proved that the books and records for the years 1942 to 1946 were not in existence and part of the books for 1947 and 1948 were not in existence. 
    And that -- it was further revealed that the income tax returns themselves for the years 1942 through 1950 were no longer in existence and that the only returns in existence were those for 1951, 1952, and 1953.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    The Court gave that there are no consideration, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    It was the order as rendered by the Court, and the ruling during the trial was that irrespective of the fact the returns were not in existence and irrespective of the books the order should be that it would cover all books and records. 
    The Court apparently did not give any consideration at all to Section 7605 (a) or (b), (b) being the requirement that the examination be necessary or putting it the other way that an examination, an unnecessary examination should not be made. 
    They gave no consideration whatsoever to that part of the statute, but followed strictly Section 7602 which said that an examination could be made. 
    The books could be had if the examination were relevant to the books and records. 
    And it goes -- it appears to go without saying that any examination for an in -- for a year of taxes that the books would be relevant to that examination.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    No. 
    Your Honor, there is not in this case involved a -- any criminal offense of any kind as a matter of fact. 
    The only question involved is whether the agent has the right to these books and records for the years involved where the statute of limitations have expired. 
    Now you have two statutes of limitations, a three-year statute of limitations which is ordinary expiration. 
    You also have the six-year statute. 
    During the six-year period after return is filed, the Government may set up additional income if the taxpayer has omitted 25% of his income shown in his return. 
    The -- there's also the six-year statute for criminal prosecution and we don't have that here involved, but it appears that the Government has argued in its brief that by not allowing the agent to have these books and records for these years that we are restricting him unnecessarily because that's when he needs the greatest ability to get to the facts about the taxpayer's income. 
    However, they threw together the fact that they said in their brief that criminal and civil while the constitution itself or the Fifth Amendment gives the taxpayer the privilege if he feels a prosecution is eminent and he has committed a fraud, he has the privilege to keep his books and records and refuse to give them to the Government agent.

    If you -- the District Court in doing the trial stated that even though the books and records were not in existence that didn't deter the agent from making a demand and bringing the taxpayer into court and receiving an order. 
    We objected to the order on the grounds that it should not have covered the years during which there were no books. 
    But the Court said that -- at a later time when the agent made the request for the books then it -- there was a chance -- the opportunity to say, “Well, I don't have those books and therefore I can't comply.”

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Well, I would say it would Your Honor. 
    Section 7602 is the one which gives the agent the power to secure the books and it was incorporated in the law prior to 7605. 
    7602 apparently created -- a bit of a trouble because of the fact that at that time there were some agents who were apparently taking advantage of this great power which the agent had of bringing in the taxpayer and ordering him to bring in his books. 
    Thereupon Congress receiving a great many letter complaints from taxpayers throughout the country and must be realized that this is in the early stages of the income tax law and that 1921, the Court -- the Congress passed this statute which said that the examinations should not be made of the taxpayers' books unless there were some necessity. 
    The words of the Congress were that no taxpayer should be subjected to an unnecessary examination. 
    Now this Section was passed because of the complaints of taxpayers to the Congress. 
    And obviously the Congress had probably discussed the matter of protecting taxpayers with the Commissioner. 
    And normally under the 7602, the restriction of an agent would be by administrative treatment that is if the taxpayer had a complaint he would take it up or perhaps pay now to the district director or with the Commissioner himself. 
    But that's a rather slow process and the Congress realized that the taxpayer wanted real protection. 
    He had to be protected right at the time that the agent knocked at the taxpayer's front door. 
    So the Congress passed this, Section 7605 to give the taxpayer the protection that he needed. 
    Now if it doesn't mean that, it's absolutely superfluous, it's unnecessary because the government agent already had the authority to demand the books through 7602.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    No Your Honor it would not for this reason. 
    That under 7602, the agent and the Commissioner are authorized to examine the books for purposes of verification. 
    And I think that's a very good point because it gets -- we get to the -- this position. 
    The backbone of the federal income tax laws is the self-assessment. 
    Each taxpayer assesses himself and the Congress wants to encourage and protect the taxpayer in this self-assessment. 
    You -- to encourage this self-assessment the agent is authorized to go out and verify the returns, and that's his purpose during the open years is to verify the return, to examine the return to see if it is in accordance with the taxpayer's books. 
    Now after the open years it's a different situation. 
    You have the statute of limitations which bars the collection of the tax, and unless there is fraud, unless there is suspicion of fraud that is, there could be no reason to make an examination. 
    During the open years they have the reason that under this self-assessment system, not only the taxpayer should welcome an examination because they often get an overpayment, get a refund. 
    And the Government of course gets -- collects taxes where there are errors in the favor of the taxpayer, but after the years are barred when the years are only open by fraud, it seems that there'd be no reason to make an examination. 
    And I think the statute of limitations itself in this particular Act 7605 is to encourage and push the agents into making the examinations during the open years.

    He is authorized to make an examination in case of fraud. 
    And I think even the Government has in its brief said where fraud is present well he more or less assume that there's a situation which requires an examination of fraud. 
    Now, it seems that in that line of thinking that why would the Commissioner or a District Director, send out an agent after the years are barred except by fraud to make an examination unless he had some indication that there was fraud. 
    Now this would not affect the examination or investigation by the Government at all because if there is any seed at all in the hands of the agent or the Commissioner it's just simply not to go into court and show it.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    It would Your Honor, it would. 
    And I think that's the purpose of the Congress in passing this Act and having the statute of limitations that after this statute has barred the years, the taxpayer should have some, as the Congress has said, some piece of mind. 
    He should have some rest from there on out. 
    And in that particular situation the Congress itself orders the destruction of the income tax returns periodically. 
    Now, if they had anticipated that they wanted a spot check as a routine thing, years would be barred except open by fraud and that -- and one must not forget that we have the six-year statute put as open, but there's a 25% omission. 
    This is beyond that where the years are barred except by fraud that the Congress itself has destroyed the returns, I believe up through 5th -- 1955, well that's eight years from this particular period now, not from this case involved. 
    Therefore, they themselves revealed an intent that there should not be spot checks because it's a waste of the Government's money to go out and make spot checks unless they have some in hand to show fraud. 
    Because there again, the Congress has placed upon the Government a burden, they have the burden of proof in the case of fraud penalty. 
    It's the -- and the taxpayer during the years that are open has the burden of proof to establish that the agent is wrong. 
    And there again, you have the purpose of encouraging and pushing agents into making an examination during the open years so that the taxpayer can after the six years, the honest taxpayer may sit down and not worry so much about his records that he might sleep in peace.

    Indeed they have, and Your Honor, this one's a further factor I might add. 
    Let's assume that the Government couldn't get the books of a taxpayer who perhaps was dishonest. 
    They can send a statutory notice and have a trial in the United States tax court and issue him a subpoena and he has to then bring his books to court, and at that time the agent will have the opportunity to examine the books.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    In some instance that's true. 
    In most instances of this kind, this type of a case, the Government sets up a net worth and most of the proof is by reason of third party records. 
    Now, we don't have the problem of third party here which we find in some cases. 
    They can get the records of third parties to establish net worth and it's obvious here that that's the basis on which they were claiming that there was a case.

    That's when the agent gets the man, gets his books.

    The Commissioner in those -- well, recognized agents will say, "You have the right to counsel particularly in a case of a fraud case". 
    If a fraud's involved they will say, “Well, you have the right to counsel.” 
    And they will usually forewarn the taxpayer that whatever he says will be used against him at a later time of the trial, and that's particularly true in the criminal case.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    The only way he'd have a right to an open hearing would be to refuse his -- to give the tax -- the agent his books, and then the process is that the agent goes in, files a complaint asking the District Court for an order to require the taxpayer to bring in his books.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1987.255" stopTime="1988.503">

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    I think the -- that combined that you must put that in the whole sphere of the income tax law. 
    You have this 7605 which says the taxpayer shall not be subjected to an unnecessary examination. 
    Now, that must mean more than something just that the examination of these books of this taxpayer is relevant to the agent's examination. 
    That must mean something more than that.

    Justice Byron R. White

    We feel that the statute of limitations and the -- these other factors the Govt -- the Congress ordering the destruction of the income tax returns. 
    And this whole system of self-assessment is based upon the honesty of the ordinary taxpayer. 
    And I think the statistics show that the average taxpayer wants to be honest and he is honest. 
    And the purpose of this interpretation is fitted into the picture of the statute of limitation is to give the taxpayer some protection from a personal motive on the part of the agent. 
    And in this particular case, we didn't have the opportunity to show the personal motive. 
    We made an offer of certain indictments with respect to a man the name of Kimble. 
    Mr. Kimble had been indicted. 
    Mr. Kimble's brother lived next to the examining agent in Louisville. 
    Louisville and Maysville are fairly far apart. 
    We didn't have the opportunity to show a personal motive. 
    I think the reason you have here you say an unnecessary examination. 
    It's almost impossible to show a personal motive on the part of an agent. 
    And unless you say that the agents must show some reasonable basis, you make it impossible to show that there is a personal motive.

    Made it of those years after all.
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="2468.001" stopTime="2477.978">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    For these years he had made a tentative net worth of the assets. 
    So --

    Yes.

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    -- relative only to the net worth assets. 
    Now, the assets without liabilities doesn't mean anything at all.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2485.848" stopTime="2514.979">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But if those were so large and untoward -- might not play -- might not he then go to the returns which he evidently did, that it were filed for the previous years and he saw that they were small perhaps and this large accumulation of net worth during 1954 to 1958 might lead to suspicion of some either error, defalcation or some fraud or something in the previous returns.
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="2514.979" stopTime="2531.248">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Well, that's very possible that he would see in 1954 to 1958. 
    However the years 1954 to 1958 were settled irrespective of any claim of fraud for the prior years then were --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2531.248" stopTime="2550.499">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You say a net comp-- in a net worth, you'd have to go back to a period which you could prove exactly how much money you had or you had nothing on the other, then you deal forward. 
    Do you remember in a case I happen to write in Colorado, I forgot the name of it now --
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="2550.499" stopTime="2608.874">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Precisely. 
    Now you also, as I say had the liabilities and you -- as you have said, you'd have returns to compare this increase in net worth. 
    An increase in net worth is the important item. 
    It's simple enough for an agent to come in and set forth a net worth, but for an agent to say this has a net worth assets means nothing, because you have to show a net worth -- an increase in the net worth during the years over and beyond what has been reported in the returns for the respective years. 
    In this particular case the agent didn't even have the returns. 
    The returns for the years 1942 to 1950 are not in existence. 
    The years for 1951, two and three were in existence but the prior years were not. 
    Therefore, it would appear that he couldn't have had any reasonable basis to suspect fraud. 
    Here, he didn't have to retained returns. 
    He didn't had the file returns, that is --

    This of course, you're dealing here with a problem which involves every person practically in the United States. 
    You have a problem here that concerns every taxpayer and that's most of us in the country and in the other you're not dealing with very many people. 
    It's a limited number of people applying from year to year. 
    Income taxes are something that we have with us constantly every minute. 
    Here, we have the current year then we have the next year and it's a matter of applying to a great millions of people who you find do worry about whether or not they made some small error in their returns which someone may feel destroyed. 
    I think this broad application to millions of people would justify requiring that some showing be made and perhaps a little more of a showing than there is in the case as you suggested about a search warrant.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    That I could just point to you a couple of the relevant facts which may have been a little clouded. 
    One is that none of the years which are involved here was there a prior inspection of the taxpayer's records. 
    We originally asked for 1945, we do not press that any longer. 
    There was a prior inspection. 
    We have not filed a necessary notice under Section 7605 (b) and we are not now entitled those records unless such a notice is filed, and has not yet been filed.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    The order -- a summons may be issued by ordinary agents and the purpose of Section 7605 (b) was that the Congress thought that ordinary agent shouldn't have the authority to issue summonses when there'd already been a prior inspection of the records. 
    And so what the Congress did is pick out this one group where there'd been a prior inspection and said for that purpose you've got to have -- there's got to be a finding by either the Commissioner or his delegate and --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    And I'm told that the Internal Revenue Service does not do random sampling after the three years has run. 
    Now this makes perfect sense. 
    It's a bit -- it would be really a waste of time and effort. 
    You have a limited number of agents and if you're going to do random sampling, you would do it prior to the three-year period because virtually any error you pick up during that period you can do something about it and after the three-year period most of the things that you find you can't do anything about. 
    So they don't do random sampling and I don't think that they would make any sense for them to do so.

    As I understand the petitioner's basic argument, isn't -- it isn't this bad faith being other than maybe as it colors the case a little bit. 
    He's arguing that the Government has to show probable cause. 
    And I take it that the standard is probable cause under the Fourth Amendment. 
    The First Circuit which is the circuit other than the third which most clearly agrees with him, it does use Fourth Amendment cases. 
    And I take it, what he's doing and his combining this Fourth Amendment standard then with much more loose procedures, he's going to get, you know, and he's going to end up -- this has been suggested here by Your Honors with fairly quite a strict standard of proof by the Government and then a full adversary trial, and he -- as he wants it, he wants to cross-examine the Government witnesses.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No we're not dealing with the constitutional problem at all Your Honor. 
    Neither this case nor the Powell case raises that question. 
    I only alluded to the Fourth Amendment because it appears that the standard that's being argued for under Section 7605 (b) or the statute of limitations or whatever. 
    It is apparently the probable cause standard in the Fourth Amendment, but if they are successful in that, going back to Your Honor's question, I think it's a very good guess that that amount of litigation in this field is going to expand very, very greatly.

    He should be able to -- that's right. 
    In Powell he didn't. 
    In other cases which we've won in the Courts of Appeals he has not testified, the Foster case in the Second Circuit. 
    I'd like to emphasize that the position that the Government takes in this case, we don't believe it's a noble one in the area of administrative subpoenas. 
    And I'd like to point to several decisions of this Court which have dealt with administrative subpoenas issued by other agencies. 
    One is United States versus Martin Salt Company and that's in 338 United States and involved the Federal Trade Commission.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3830.026" stopTime="3834.862">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Do you have to have that here (Inaudible)?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3834.862" stopTime="4079.198">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No. 
    Now, let me say what the purpose of citing these cases is. 
    It's not -- these cases are not dispositive of the entire litigation. 
    What they do show is that this basic power given in Section 7602 to issue summonses that that power does not require any showing of probable cause. 
    That all we have to show is as the statute says that the records sought are relevant and material, but that -- that that's the basic scheme for administrative agencies in this country. 
    That's why I would cite Martin Salt Company for, Oklahoma Press Publishing Company, Andy Card Johnson &amp; Perkins, Civil Aeronautics Board and Herman, and all these cases are quite clear that the basic understanding for administrative agencies is that all they have to do is show relevancy and materiality. 
    And I may say what -- there is significant in Martin Salt Company, the administrative power is analogized to the power of the grand jury. 
    Now, passing that and starting from the point of view that Section 7602 does give this general power to investigate on the basis merely of relevancy and materiality no showing whatsoever by the Government is necessary. 
    Then we get to the two sections of the code which are argued by the taxpayer to limit this power. 
    And it seems to me here that theses decisions of this Court established that the taxpayer then has the burden of showing that in this field, Congress has done something different. 
    It is more narrowly limited the Commissioner than it has limited other administrative agencies. 
    The taxpayer has this burden. 
    I think that he has to show therefore that these statutes on which he relies were clearly intended to limit the power. 
    So let's go first to Section 7605 (b) and that's on -- set forth on page 27 of the Government's brief in Powell and it's also in the last page of petitioner's brief here on the Ryan case. 
    And I think it's important enough and short enough to be worth reading. 
    It says no (Inaudible) -- it starts out, “Restrictions on examination of taxpayer. 
    No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations and only one inspection of the taxpayer's books of account shall be made for each taxable year, unless the taxpayer request otherwise or unless the secretary or his delegate parenthetically the Regional Commissioner after investigation notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary.” 
    Now the taxpayer reads this section as having two separate provisions. 
    One is that an examination can't be unnecessary. 
    The second there can't be a second investigation except for under certain conditions. 
    Now the second part of the statute merely doesn't apply to him at all. 
    There hasn't been a second inspection. 
    Therefore what he is arguing is that the provision about investigations not being unnecessary incorporates the standard of probable cause. 
    Now our first argument is that there are -- there is not. 
    This section can not be divided into two pieces. 
    Now looking just in its language I think you could reasonably argue either way. 
    You could say that the conjunction then separates out two separate sections or there is one. 
    However, we think that even looking to the language alone that what Congress was apparently intending to do was to prevent second investigations. 
    We think this is partic --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4079.198" stopTime="4084.898">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If that's all they're intending to do then they wouldn't have put in the first clause before the “and” they would --

    -- the narrowest language, I suppose that's right. 
    I think though -- the reason I say that I'd -- that even from the wording -- that even from the wording that that's only one section with one purpose is that in the second portion, Congress again used the term necessary which suggests that what it was doing is saying there shouldn't be unnecessary examinations and that it considered unnecessary examinations second investigations unless a high official in the service said they were necessary.

    That's right Your Honor. 
    Now let me take the -- except the taxpayers premise however that there're two sections to it, and that the first part this applies to any investigation whether it's a first or second one. 
    Webster defines unnecessary as needless or useless. 
    In our view this is no different than what Section 7602 requires, because it requires that the record sought to be relevant and material. 
    If records -- if the records are relevant and material they certainly are not needless or useless. 
    And therefore, we believe that even accepting the taxpayer's premise that still all that we have to show, all that the service has to show is relevancy and materiality --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I am going to Your Honor. 
    Let me deal just for a moment with the legislative history of this section because even if the wording of Section 7605 were less clear than we think it is that the legislative history which is set out in full in the Government's brief in the Powell case and it's quite briefed but it's -- we think it's sufficient because both the committee reports, the sponsors and the House and the Senate, and individual congressmen in both Houses stated in its purpose was to prevent the embarrassment of taxpayers by repeated investigations unless there was a good reason for further examination of their records. 
    And Congress was willing to allow this determination of whether there was good reason to be left to the Commissioner or to his deputy, but not to ordinary agents. 
    There's not a single word in the legislative history to indicate that Congress was even considering the problem of initial examinations, and there's certainly not a word to indicate the probable cause or any other judicially enforced standard was being imposed for the first time on the service. 
    And we think it's very strange to assume that this was the intent of the Congress in the absence of any discussion whatsoever when there was considerable discussion of --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I understand -- you don't know the answer to my question or?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4367.699" stopTime="4369.571">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I'm not certain of it Your Honor, I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4369.571" stopTime="4370.913">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't know the answer, I gather.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4370.913" stopTime="4476.686">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I am almost certain that there was a three-year statute of limitations because my recollection is that the first cases in this field which were prior to the 1939 code talked about the statute of limitations and I think it was three years. 
    I may say that the cases that -- I may say the cases that do deal with the earlier statutes are cited in the Powell -- in our reply brief in Powell and in the respondent's brief in Powell, In re Keagan, Brooklyn Pawn Brokers, the Andrews case, and I -- and they discussed the statue of limitations. 
    And I'm almost certain that there was a statute and that it was three years. 
    Let me now turn to the effect of the statute of limitation, Section 6501. 
    I may say that there is no three years. 
    There's a -- there are three periods. 
    There's a three years and then there's three to six which has a different effect and then there's the period after six years. 
    Before three all tax liability is open, three to six years, fraud and under statement of income by more than 25% is open, after six years just fraud is open, or failure to file a return at all. 
    Now on its phase, Section 6501 doesn't seem to have anything to do with investigations. 
    It doesn't limit the Commissioner's power. 
    It doesn't limit the Commissioner's power to make his assessments. 
    When we submit the absence of any congressional intent shown, either in legislative history on the phase of the statute that the basic rule of Section 7602, which as I've indicated, is unmodified by Section 7605 should mean.

    (Inaudible) 
    You're investigating -- your -- if you want to see my book not because you think I am fraudulent, because it'll help you prove that Justice Brennan is fraudulent, you can get my book without saying anything other than give me your book.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4500.290" stopTime="4507.036">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    And that we make a showing of relevancy and materiality because we've got to do that under Section 7602.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4507.036" stopTime="4514.511">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you don't have to do anything about it from my book and satisfy the justices about the material helping in the investigation.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4514.511" stopTime="4627.649">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right and that's just the ordinary rules I've indicated for administrative subpoenas.Now there are creations of -- how far you can lead from that. 
    You can say, well, we have to state that they're relevant and material to investigation for fraud. 
    We'll actually -- the particular summons my not actually go to fraud. 
    For example, we -- they have other evidence of fraud.If the summons goes to a tax deficiency that tax deficiency is opened up by the fraud and we can collect 50% of the total tax deficiency not just to the fraud part. 
    That's what the statute says. 
    So that the particular summons does not even have to go to fraud. 
    It can go to ordinary tax liability but the investigation as a whole we can only make an assessment on the basis of fraud. 
    On the other hand, we may be just starting the investigation and starting with tax liability. 
    The Oklahoma Press Publishing Company case says that the Government need not show coverage of a statute before it looks to whether there's been a violation. 
    It can do that both at the same time. 
    So we could -- or even separately, so we could be issuing a summons in order to show tax liability. 
    Later on then look to see whether there had been fraud. 
    But alternatively, even if we're wrong about the statute of limitations our alternative argument is as been suggested by Your Honors that the complaint in testimony in this case were sufficient that it's enough to say that we have a basis for suspecting the fraud that's been committed, and here of course we went beyond that. 
    We gave it at least to some extent in conclusory terms the basis for the statement.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, our initial position is all we have to show it's relevant and material to a valid investigation that's it. 
    Alternatively, we argue that it's enough to state by affidavit or testimony that we have reason to believe, that we have reason to suspect, that we have this suspicion that fraud has been committed.

   Rebuttal of William R. Bagby
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4753.375" stopTime="4760.214">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Bagby did you have anything in rebuttal?
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="4760.214" stopTime="4827.513">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Your Honor, I'd like to add a word or two. 
    I'd like to point out that in connection with the complaint which was filed by the agent to which he subscribed. 
    He said there was a basis for fraud, but in this complaint he also said that the taxpayer had all of his books and records. 
    And yet during the hearing, he acknowledged that he had never asked the taxpayer for his books and records and apparently did not know whether or not they all existed. 
    Another point to which I'd like to point out is -- reveal is that the first part of 7605 states that an examination shall be at a reasonable time and place. 
    This is for the protection of the taxpayer and is a part of the whole picture in which this unreasonable examination and investigation must be placed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4827.513" stopTime="4841.894">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is the only basis for charging it in an unreasonable investigation or examination, the one you have stated that they did not show sufficiently that there was reasonable cause to believe he was guilty of fraud?
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="4841.894" stopTime="4866.091">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Not only that Your Honor but the fact that the interpretation of -- under -- of this clause, 7605 (b) requires that the Government reveal at the hearing in the District Court some facts revealing a reasonable basis, and the opinion of the District Court that there is a suspicion of fraud. 
    We --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4866.091" stopTime="4867.991">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was the only attack?

    Sir?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4868.744" stopTime="4874.046">

    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    I would say that fairly well covers it Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4877.301" stopTime="4890.050">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about this suggestion or may be less than a suggestion, innuendo of bad faith. 
    Were you prevented from developing any such claim as that in the District Court?
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="4890.050" stopTime="4932.668">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    Yes, during the trial we were Your Honor, because the Court believed that all the agent need to do is to show that he was making an examination for these years. 
    And therefore, everything was relevant and material to that examination. 
    And he said fraud or no fraud irrespective of that that we must show. 
    He said that we must show that the agent was wrongful. 
    However, we didn't have the opportunity to present evidence because he felt that the agent, as he in his words said, an agent has the right to stop the first person that he sees on the street and demand and get his books and records.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4932.668" stopTime="4957.151">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now the Court of Appeals didn't agree with that though. 
    The Court of Appeals said, “This is not to say that the Court is without power to determine whether the investigation is being made in good faith.” 
    And are you -- I want to know if you're suggesting here that you are making a claim that this investigation was not being made in good faith and that you were prevented from pursuing that claim in the District Court?
speaker="william_r_bagby" startTime="4957.151" stopTime="5001.361">
    Mr. William R. Bagby 
    That is one of our positions, it's correct. 
    Although we haven't developed that as much as we could've if we'd had more evidence to show further bad faith, and then pointing it out here the fact that the agent had said in his complaint that all of the books and records existed. 
    And during the trial, a very meager colleague we had he said that he did not -- he had not asked the taxpayer. 
    I -- perhaps I'm missing the -- we do not feel that we had a reasonable hearing on the basis that the Court believed that all the agent had to do is ask for the books and records. 
    Thank Your Honor.
