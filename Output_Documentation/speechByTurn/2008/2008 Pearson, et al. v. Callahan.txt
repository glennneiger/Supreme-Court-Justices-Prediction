    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    The first case is Pearson versus Callahan 07-751. 
    This case comes to us under the certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    State law enforcement officers conducted a warrantless search of respondent's house incident to his arrest for the sale of drugs to an undercover informant whom he had voluntarily admitted to the premises. 
    The respondent sued the officers for violating his Fourth Amendment rights. 
    The Court of Appeals held that the officers were not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. 
    In granting review, we ask the parties to brief the additional question whether the mandatory procedure for considering qualified immunity claim set out in Saucier versus Katz should be retained. 
    For reasons set out in an opinion filed today, we hold that the Saucier procedure should not be regarded as mandatory but should be left into the sound discretion of the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals. 
    We also hold that the petitioner's summary judgment motion should have been granted because it was not clearly established at the time in question that the search was unconstitutional. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
