    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case comes to us from the state court for the Court of Appeals of New York. 
    Petitioner, a prison inmate filed two 1983 actions against several correction officials alleging that they violated his civil rights. 
    He filed his claims in the State Supreme Court which is the trial court in New York and sought punitive damages and attorney's fees. 
    The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that under New York's Correction Law Section 24, it lacked jurisdiction to entertain any suit, federal or state seeking money damages from correction officers. 
    On appeal, petitioner argued that Correction Law Section 24 has jurisdiction limitation interfered with Section 1983 and therefore violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. 
    The New York Court of Appeals disagreed. 
    It held that because the law treats federal and state damage actions against correction officials equally, it should be considered a valid excuse for the State's refusal to entertain petitioner's federal cause of action. 
    We granted certiorari and now reverse. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the Correction Law violates the Supremacy Clause. 
    The law is motivated by New York's belief that damages suits filed by prisoners against correction officers are by and large frivolous and that the state actor should be shielded from liability. 
    The fact that New York has chosen to effectuate this policy goal by selectively withdrawing jurisdiction from its courts overall such to suits, federal and state does not alter our Supremacy Clause analysis. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Alito have joined Part III of that opinion.
