    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The respondents for many years, smokes cigarettes manufactured by the petitioners, cigarettes marketed by the petitioners as being light or low tar. 
    In 2005, respondents filed suit in the United States District Court. 
    The suit alleged that those cigarettes do not in fact deliver less tar than regular cigarettes. 
    It further alleged that petitioner's fraudulent concealment of that fact violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
    In the District Court, the petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as amended expressly preempts the respondent's claims. 
    The Labeling Act provides that no requirement or provision based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes that are labeled in conformity with the federal law. 
    The petitioners also argued that respondent's claim is impliedly preempted because it is inconsistent with the Federal Trade Commission policy encouraging cigarette manufacturers' use of light and low tar descriptors. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment for the petitioners. 
    It concluded that the respondent's claim is expressly preempted because it seeks to require or prohibit certain statements in petitioner's advertising based on smoking and health. 
    The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed. 
    It characterized respondent's claim as a fraud claim and so not based on smoking and health. 
    The Court of Appeals held the claim is not expressly preempted. 
    It also rejected petitioner's implied preemption argument. 
    It found no federal policy incurred in cigarette manufacturers to use light or low tar descriptors. 
    We granted certiorari to address both the express and implied preemption questions. 
    In an opinion authored by Justice Stevens, we now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    16 years ago in Cipollone versus Liggett Group, the Court held that the Labeling Act did not preempt a common law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently concealed a material fact about their product. 
    The state statute under which respondents in this case filed suit prohibits deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. 
    Like the fraud claim in Cipollone, respondent's claim alleges a breach of the duty not to deceive, a duty that is not based on smoking and health. 
    We now follow our disposition of the common law fraud claim in Cipollone in rejecting petitioner's argument that the similar statutory claim in this case is preempted. 
    We also reject petitioner's contention that respondents' claim is impliedly preempted because it will present an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC. 
    Petitioners argue that the FTC has for decades promoted the development and consumption of low tar cigarettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on manufacturers' representations of tar and nicotine content. 
    Our study of the regulatory history however, reveals no such policy. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Alito have joined.
