    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The second case I have to announce is 08-88, Vermont against Brillon. 
    This case concerns the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy a right to a speedy trial. 
    Michael Brillon, defendant below, respondent here, was arrested in July 2001 on felony domestic assault and habitual offender charges. 
    Nearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by a jury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison. 
    The Vermont Supreme Court vacated Brillon's conviction and held that the charges against him must be dismissed because he had been denied his right to a speedy trial. 
    During the time between Brillon's arrest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to represent him. 
    Brillon fired the first, who served from July 2001 to February 2002. 
    His third lawyer, who served from March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he reported that Brillon had threatened his life. 
    The Vermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the delays associated with those periods, but charged against the State periods in which assigned counsel failed to move the case forward. 
    We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system. 
    Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent. 
    For a total of some six months of the time that elapsed between Brillon's arrest and his trial, Brillon lacked an attorney. 
    The State may be charged with those months if the gaps resulted from the trial court's failure to appoint replacement counsel with dispatch. 
    Similarly, the State may bear responsibility if there is a breakdown in the public defender system. 
    But, as the Vermont Supreme Court acknowledged, the record does not establish any such institutional breakdown. 
    For these reasons detailed further in our opinion, we hold that the record in this case does not show that Brillon was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens joins.
