    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning case 08-6, District Attorney's Office versus Osborne. 
    The question presented in this case is whether there is a constitutional right to access DNA evidence outside of a state's established procedures for providing it. 
    The respondent, William Osborne was convicted in Alaska state court of kidnapping, sexual assault, and other crimes. 
    The appellate courts reviewing his conviction found no errors at the trial. 
    Years later, Osborne filed this federal lawsuit seeking access to biological evidence from the crime scene so that he could subject it to DNA testing. 
    After two rounds of litigation, the Court of Appeals held that he had a constitutional right to DNA testing under the Due Process Clause. 
    We granted certiorari to review that decision. 
    DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. 
    The question is how to harness DNA's power to prove innocence in the established criminal justice system. 
    Answering that question is a task that belongs primarily to the legislature. 
    46 states and the Federal Government have already enacted statutes dealing specifically with access to DNA evidence. 
    These laws recognize the value of DNA testing, but also the need for conditions on accessing the state's evidence. 
    Alaska is one of the handfuls of states yet to enact specific DNA testing legislation, but Alaska courts are applying existing discovery procedures to this noble technology. 
    Alaska gives prisoners a right to be released if they make a sufficiently compelling showing that they are actually innocent. 
    Alaska also provides procedures to vindicate that right. 
    There is no time limit on bringing an actual innocence claim under Alaska law, and there are procedures for accessing evidence to support an actual innocence claim. 
    Alaska courts have ruled that these procedures include access to evidence for DNA testing in certain circumstances. 
    There are some restrictions on access similar to the ones provided by federal law and the laws of other states, but we see nothing inadequate about those procedures. 
    In addition to challenging the adequacy of the state's procedures, Osborne makes a far more reaching argument that substantive due process requires us to recognize a free standing right to DNA evidence outside of the state criminal justice system. 
    That is an unprecedented and sweeping approach considering whether to accept that approach largely turns on two different conceptions of the role of the federal judiciary. 
    Under one view, the federal courts should generally allow Congress and the states to confront new technological problems and they should be hesitant to intervene in short circuit a prompt and considered legislative response. 
    In contrast, under Osborne's view, the federal judiciary must leap ahead constitutionalizing the issue and taking it away from the democratic process. 
    We favor the more restrained course. Congress and the states are actively legislating in the area of DNA testing. 
    46 states and the Federal Government have already passed laws on the subject. 
    At the end of the day, there is no reason to think that the federal judiciary would handle the issue more wisely as a matter of constitutional law when state courts and legislatures are doing as a matter of policy. 
    Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we reject Osborne's substantive due process claim. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. 
    Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Kennedy has joined and which Justice Thomas has joined in part. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices GInsburg and Breyer have joined and which Justice Souter joined in part. 
    Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.
