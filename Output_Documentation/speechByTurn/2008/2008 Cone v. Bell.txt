    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Twenty seven years ago, petitioner Gary Cone was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. 
    Much of the delay in the execution of his sentence is attributable to the pretrial decision of Tennessee prosecutors not to disclose various police reports and witness statements that Cone contends were subject to disclosure under this Court's decision in Brady against Maryland. 
    Cone first raised his Brady claim in a petition for state postconviction relief. 
    The state court denied relief on the incorrect ground that the claim had been resolved in earlier state court proceedings. 
    The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 
    Cone then sought relief in the federal court by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
    The District Court held that Cone could not obtain federal relief on his Brady claim because the state court had denied the claim on procedural grounds. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed concluding that the state court's dismissal of Cone's claim was barred on an inadequate and independent state ground -- ground but -- ground. 
    We granted certiorari to answer the question whether a federal habeas claim is “procedurally defaulted” when it is twice presented to the state courts. 
    We now hold that the state court's rejection of Cone's Brady claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review. 
    We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court to make a full review of the suppressed evidence and to consider whether if it had not -- if it had been disclosed, it might have persuaded the jury to impose a noncapital sentence. 
    The Chief Justice has found an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.
