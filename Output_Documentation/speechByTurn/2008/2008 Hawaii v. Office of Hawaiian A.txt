    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Hawaii after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. 
    The United States annexed Hawaii as a territory and years later, admitted it to the Union as the 58th State. 
    In 1993, Congress passed an Apology Resolution which apologized to the native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of Hawaiian monarchy. 
    After the enactment of the Apology Resolution, respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs filed this lawsuit in the Hawaii State Court. 
    Respondent claimed that the Apology Resolution constituted a congressional recognition of unrelinquished land claims held by native Hawaiians against the State of Hawaii. 
    Respondent therefore sought an injunction to prevent the State from selling its sovereign lands pending resolution of those unrelinquished claims. 
    The state trial court denied respondents' request for relief but the Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed. 
    Relying on the Apology Resolution, the State Supreme Court agreed with respondent and barred the State from selling certain of its lands. 
    We conclude that the Apology Resolution did not purport to have legal effect. 
    Indeed, the resolution would create serious constitutional concerns if it had attempted to cloud Hawaii's title to its sovereign lands more than three decades after the State's admission to the Union. 
    For this and other reasons set out in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii and remand for further proceedings. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
