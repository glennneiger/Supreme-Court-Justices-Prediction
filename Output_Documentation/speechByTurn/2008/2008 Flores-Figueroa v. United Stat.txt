    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    A federal statute entitled aggravated identity theft makes it a crime to -- the language support in here, â€œknowingly transfer, posses, or use without lawful authority a means of identification of another person" during or in relation to some other crime and it increases the penalty imposed upon a person who for example uses fraudulent documents in that particular way. 
    The petitioner, Ignacio Flores-Figueroa gave his employer a false Social Security card and other counterfeit documents that contained his name, but an identification number that belong to another person. 
    The question before us is whether the statute requires the Government to prove that Flores-Figueroa knew that the numbers belong to another person. 
    And we conclude that it does. To understand why that so, it's necessary to look at the statute, it starts with the word, "knowingly" followed by verb such as "transfer" followed by an object, namely a means of identification of another person. 
    In most context, listeners take the use of a simple English sentence constructed in this way to mean that knowingly modifies a verb's object. 
    If I tell you, John knowingly ate a BLT sandwich, we assume that John knew that what he ate, namely a sandwich contained bacons, lettuce, and tomato. 
    If I tell you only -- without using the word "knowingly", John sent the bank draft to the capital of Honduras. 
    You think John may or may not know the name of that capital city. 
    But if I tell you John knowingly did so, it is more likely that I'm telling you that John also knows the name of the capital of Honduras which happens to be Tegucigalpa which not too many people know. 
    Now, what is true in life is true in law. 
    Ordinarily, we read the word, "knowingly" in a criminal statute as modifying the object that follows. 
    At least in the absence of special circumstances and there are no special circumstances here. 
    To the contrary, the statute imposes its extra punishment not upon counterfeiting or fraud but upon identity theft. 
    And it is natural to read such a statute as insisting that the Government show that the defendant knew that he was stealing somebody's identity. 
    Thus, we hold that the Government must show that Flores-Figueroa knew that the false means of identification he gave his employer were those of another person. 
    For these reasons and others more fully explained in our opinion, we all reverse an Eighth Circuit determination to the contrary and we remand the case. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justice Thomas has joined. 
    Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
