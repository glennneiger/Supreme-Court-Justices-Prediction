    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The first case is Ministry of Defense of Iran against Elahi. 
    It is about a private lawsuit against the Government of Iran, and it involves a private person, Dariush Elahi who obtained a default judgment for $312 million against the State of Iran based upon Iran's involvement in the death of his brother. 
    He wants to enforce that judgment in part by attaching an asset that's owned by Iran, namely a $2.8 million judgment that Iran won against the company called Cubic. 
    Now the private party, Mr. Elahi can overcome what is a normal legal rule that would prevent any attachment of property owned by a foreign government as Iran has only if he can show two things. 
    He has to show both that our Government has blocked Iran's assets, which makes them available to suit and attachment. 
    And he also has to show that he didn't waive by a certain action his right to attach the Cubic Judgment. 
    The Ninth Circuit thought that both of these conditions were met but we think the contrary. 
    As to the first requirement, namely, that the assets be blocked, we find that the Ninth Circuit was wrong when it said that the Cubic Judgment was blocked at the time the Circuit made the decision and all of the parties agree on that including Elahi. 
    But it maybe that those assets became reblocked due to recent executive actions and that latter question was not decided really by the court below, it hasn't been fully argued so we won't decide it either. 
    We turn instead to the waiver question. 
    Now in 2003, the United States paid Elahi $2.3 million as partial compensation for his claim against Iran. 
    When he got that money, he signed a paper and he agreed in that paper to relinquish “all rights to attach property that is at issue in claims against the United States before an international tribunal.” 
    And there, we have to say we think the Cubic Judgment is property that is at issue in one of those tribunals, namely the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal that was set up by the Algiers Accords years ago. 
    United States and Iran do not dispute that the valid -- they think the Cubic Judgment is valid. 
    They agree. 
    But they do dispute whether Iran, if it win some of its other claims there, has to use that Cubic Judgment as a set off against the money the United States would otherwise owe it. 
    In particular, if anybody has attached the judgment, Iran says it does not have to use the judgment as a set off. 
    The United States says it does have to use the judgment as a set off. 
    So this dispute in our view means the judgment is at issue in that forum. 
    Thus, it is the kind of property that Elahi, when he received the $2.3 million from the Government, promised not to attach and he has to live up to that promise. 
    We reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which Justices Souter and Ginsburg have joined.
