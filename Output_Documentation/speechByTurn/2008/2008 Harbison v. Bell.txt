    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The petitioner was sentenced to death by a Tennessee court in 1983. 
    Five years later, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which create a new capital offense. 
    Section 3599 of that Act authorized the appointment of counsel to represent indigent defendants in capital cases including federal habeas corpus proceedings challenging death sentences imposed in state courts and also in "proceedings for executive or other clemency". 
    In 1997, after petitioner exhausted his state remedies, a Federal District Judge appointed counsel to represent him in a federal challenge to his death sentence. 
    That challenge was ultimately unsuccessful. 
    The question that is now presented to us is whether Section 3599 authorizes his attorney to represent him in Tennessee's clemency proceedings. 
    The Court of Appeals held that although such representation is authorized for federal clemency proceedings, it is not authorized for a state clemency proceeding. 
    We disagree. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that Section 3599 does authorize federally appointed counsel to represent their clients in state clemency proceedings and entitles them to compensation for that representation. 
    The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas have filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Alito has joined.
