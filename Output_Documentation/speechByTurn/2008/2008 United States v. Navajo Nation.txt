    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in Case 07-1410, United State versus Navajo Nation, which I will announce. 
    For over 15 years, the Navajo Nation Indian Tribe has been pursuing litigation against the Federal Government seeking $600 million in compensation for what it says was a breach of trust by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    The Secretary allegedly violated duties to the Tribe by failing promptly to approve an increased royalty rate for a coal lease that had been executed in 1964 by the Tribe and a mining company. 
    Under the terms of that lease, the royalty rate was subject to reasonable adjustment by the Secretary of Interior after 20 years. 
    The Tribe accordingly sought to secure an increase in the royalty rate but the mining company objected. 
    According to the Tribe, the Secretary delayed acting on the matter until economic pressures forced the Tribe to reach a far less favorable negotiated settlement. 
    The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit initially held in favor of the Tribe but six years ago, we reversed that decision. 
    To recover damages from the Federal Government under the relevant statute, a Tribe must “identify” a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties. 
    We held that the statutes and regulations cited by the Tribe did not establish any enforceable fiduciary duties with respect to coal leases negotiated by Tribes with third parties. 
    We remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. 
    The Federal Circuit again held that the Tribe had a viable claim, this time based on a series of other statutes and on common law trust duties arising from the Government's comprehensive control over Indian coal. 
    Once again, we reversed. 
    The three statutes that the Federal Circuit relied upon do not provide any more sound of a basis for the Tribe's breach of trust lawsuit than those we considered and rejected the first time we considered this case, nor can the Government's control over Indian coal standing alone create fiduciary duties enforceable in suits for money damages. 
    The Federal Government has only waived sovereign immunity with respect to certain categories of claims and the Tribe cannot succeed in this lawsuit unless it identifies a “specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription.” 
    The Tribe has failed to make the showing. 
    The Court of Appeals' decision is reversed and this case should now be regarded as closed. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.
