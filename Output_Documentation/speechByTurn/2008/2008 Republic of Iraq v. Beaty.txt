    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    These two cases come to us on writs of certiorari for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    Respondents in these cases sued Iraq for monetary damages based on allegations of abuse and mistreatment by the Saddam Hussein regime during and following the first Gulf War. 
    In order to bypass the immunity from suit that ordinarily attaches to foreign sovereigns, respondents invoked a now repealed statutory provision, 28 U.S.C. Section 1605(a)(7) that stripped sovereign immunity if the foreign states actions giving rise to the claims were taken out of time when the foreign state was designated as a sponsor of terrorism pursuant to certain statutory provisions. 
    Iraq was so designated in 1990 and remained so during the period in question. 
    Iraq argued, however, that this statutory exception was unavailable because in 2003, Congress authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq "Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism." 
    The President exercised that power with respect to all such provisions of law which in Iraq's view included the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity. 
    But the Court of Appeals disagreed and allowed the suits to proceed. 
    We granted certiorari and consolidated the two cases. 
    Iraq's reading of the statutory authorization is the most straightforward reading. 
    The terrorism exception to immunity is a provision of law and it applies to countries that have supported terrorism by virtue of their designation as such. 
    Accordingly, when the President made inapplicable as to Iraq, all provisions of law that applied to countries that have supported terrorism that included Section 1605(a)(7). 
    The Court of Appeals interpreted the authorization more narrowly because its language -- the language authorizing the President to waive appeared in a proviso clause. 
    And we have said, pursuant to ordinary English, that provisos are often meant to clarify or limit the effect of the proceeding principal clause. 
    They -- they are often used that way. 
    They should always be used that way but regrettably they're not. 
    The authorizations principal clause permitted the President to suspend the Iraq Sanctions Act but the proviso purported to grant the President an additional power here. 
    Not the power, not to limit or restrain the principal power. 
    We therefore reject the Court of Appeals' reading of the authorization statute. 
    And we likewise reject the alternative unpersuasive constructions offered by respondents before this Court which I will not describe. 
    A subsequent piece of legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, purported to ratify the Court of Appeals' interpretation, but that statute has no bearing on our analysis. 
    It was an extraordinary provision which said that nothing in Section 1503 has ever authorized directly or indirectly to making inapplicable of any provision chapter 97, waiver of sovereign immunity. 
    But we think that has nothing to do with the present case because that statute in turn authorized the President to waive its application to Iraq and the President did so. 
    Finally, respondents contend that even if Iraq sovereign immunity was restored by the President's actions, these actions sees to have force once the statutory authorization to waive expired via sunset provision in 2005. 
    We disagree. 
    The statute provided that the authorities it granted would expire. 
    That is the President's authority to waive the application of the laws but it did not unlike at least one analogous statute also mandate a similar expiration for the waivers issued pursuant to those expired authorities. 
    As a result, Iraq's sovereign immunity was restored when the President exercised his authority to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism. 
    The courts below therefore lost jurisdiction over the suits and should have dismissed the cases. 
    The judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
