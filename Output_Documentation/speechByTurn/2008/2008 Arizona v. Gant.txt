    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Arizona. 
    It raises an important Fourth Amendment issue. 
    Acting on an anonymous tip that residents in Tucson was being used to sell drugs, two police officers knocked on the front door and asked to speak to the owner. 
    Respondent Rodney Gant answered the door and after identifying himself stated that he expected the owner to return later. 
    The officers left the residence and conducted a records check which revealed that Gant's driver's license had been suspended and there was outstanding warrant for his arrest for driving with the -- on a suspended license. 
    The officers returned to house that evening and recognized Gant when his car entered the driveway. 
    They arrested him, handcuffed him, and locked him in the backseat of a squad car. 
    Two officers then searched his car and discovered a bag of cocaine in the pocket of the jacket on the backseat. 
    After Gant was changed with two drug offenses, he moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search was unreasonable because he posed no threat to the officers after he was locked in the back of the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle. 
    When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted, Officer Griffith responded, “Because the law says we can do it.” 
    The Arizona Supreme Court held that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. 
    For reasons stated at length in an opinion filed with the clerk, we agree with their conclusion and we affirm their judgment. Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion joined in full by the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy and in part by Justice Breyer. 
    Justice Breyer has also filed a dissent.
