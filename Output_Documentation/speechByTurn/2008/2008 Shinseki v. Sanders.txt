    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The second case called Shinseki versus Sanders involves harmless errors, notice errors and veterans benefit. 
    Now when a veteran applies to the Department of Foreign Affairs for benefits, the Veterans administration has to help that veteran prepare the claim for benefits. 
    And in doing that, the Veterans administration has to send the veteran some notices, various notices. 
    Some tell the veteran for example “What information is missing?” 
    “What additional information has to be provided”, and “Who is going to provide what?” 
    “Which information the Veterans Administration will provide and which the veteran has to provide?” 
    The law also says a Veterans Court and the Court of Appeals for this Federal Circuit when they review a veteran's benefit decision granting or denying the benefit, they have to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. 
    And that means they have to apply ordinary rules of harmless error. 
    Now, we here consider two cases. 
    In one of those cases, a Veterans Court found that a notice error of failure to give the right notice was harmless. 
    And in the other case, it found that the notice error was harmful. 
    The Federal Circuit reversed the first decision and in doing that, it laid down a set of harmless-error rules. 
    And in essence, those rules would find every such error harmful. 
    Unless the VA shows the veteran already knew the information or it just couldn't have been entitled to the benefit under the law. 
    Well, our job is in this case is to ask whether the rules that the Federal Circuit laid down, if you're still following this, we have to ask whether the rules that the Federal Circuit laid down are consistent with the law's ordinary civil case harmless-error rules. 
    Our answer is no. 
    They're not consistent. 
    They are too complicated. 
    They are too rigid. 
    They are too likely to make a lower court like the Veterans Court reach a long conclusion namely find an error it was harmful when it really isn't harmful after you read the record. That becomes obvious. 
    So, that's our final holding. 
    And then we review the records in the individual cases, and in one case, we reverse the Federal Circuit. 
    And then in the other, we vacate its decision and remand the case and we explained all this much more fully in the opinion. 
    Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg joined.
