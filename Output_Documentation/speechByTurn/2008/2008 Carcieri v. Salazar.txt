    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the -- which I would refer to -- I will refer to as IRA, the Federal Government is authorized to take land and hold it in trust for Indian Tribes for the purpose of providing land for Indians. 
    The Act defines the term “Indian” to “include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any organized Indian Tribe now under federal jurisdiction.” 
    In 1998, the Federal Government acting through the Secretary of the Interior sought to exercise its authority under IRA and accept into trust 31 acres of land owned by the Narragansett Indian Tribe and located in Charlestown, Rhode Island. 
    The State of Rhode Island, its governor in the town opposed the trust acquisition which would result in federal rather than local supervision of the land. 
    They argued that the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in 1934 and was not recognized by the Federal Government until 1983. 
    Thus, they argued, the Secretary lacked authority to take land into trust for members of the Narragansett Tribe. 
    The Department of Interior Board of Indian Appeals, the District Court and the Court of Appeals all rejected this challenge and upheld the legality of the acquisition. 
    The Court of Appeals determined that statutory phrase now under federal jurisdiction, is ambiguous because it could refer either to tribal status at the time the IRA was enacted in 1934 or at the time the Secretary sought to take land into trust. 
    Because the Court of Appeals found both interpretations to be reasonable, it deferred to the Secretary’s view that it could exercise its trust authority for the members of any tribe that the Interior Department had formally recognized even if that recognition came after 1934. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The phrase “now under federal jurisdiction” refers to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in 1934. 
    This reading is consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term “now” and aligns with other provisions of the IRA in which Congress used the distinct phrase “now” or “hereafter” to refer to post-enactment events. 
    Our reading is also consistent with the interpretation given the word “now” by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the time of the statute's enactment. 
    In this case, neither the Secretary nor the tribe defended the acquisition by arguing that the tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934. 
    And the evidence in the records of this question is to the contrary. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Ginsburg has joined. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
