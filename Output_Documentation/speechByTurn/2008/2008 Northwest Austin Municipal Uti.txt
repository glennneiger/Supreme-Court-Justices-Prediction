    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning in case 08-322, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District versus Holder. 
    This is a case about the obligations imposed by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
    That statute requires all covered jurisdictions to seek preclearance from federal authorities in Washington, D.C. before they can change anything about the way they hold elections. 
    That requirement applies only to certain covered jurisdictions selected by a formula Congress created 35 years ago. 
    When the Act was passed in 1965, the preclearance requirement was intended to last for five years. 
    Congress has repeatedly extended it. 
    Most recently in 2006, Congress extended it for 25 years. 
    The appellant is a small utility district with an elected board. 
    There is no evidence that it is ever discriminated on the basis of race in those elections, but it is located in the covered State of Texas and therefore is required to seek preclearance before it change anything about its elections. 
    Another part of the Voting Rights Act called the bailout provision cover -- allows the covered political subdivision to file a lawsuit in Federal District Court and to be released from the preclearance requirements if certain conditions are met. 
    The district filed such a bailout suit. 
    The district also argued in the alternative that if the Act does not permit it to bail out, the preclearance requirement of Section 5 is unconstitutional. 
    The Federal District Court rejected both claims. 
    It concluded that bailout is available only to a narrow class of political subdivisions defined in the Act not to an entity like the district. 
    It also concluded that Section 5 was constitutional. 
    The utility district appealed and we are therefore required to review the District Court judgment. 
    Unlike the situation with most of the cases that come before us, we do not have discretion to decline review of cases arising under these provisions of the Voting Rights Act. 
    The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable. 
    When the Act was first passed, unconstitutional discrimination was rampant and the racial gap in voter registration and turnout. 
    That is the gap between white registration and turnout compared to minority registration and turnout was great. 
    Today that gap has been dramatically diminished and most of the barriers to equal voting rights have long been abolished. 
    At the same time, Section 5 intrudes on the covered jurisdictions in a way otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system. 
    That aspect of the Act has, over the past 40 years, caused various members of the Court to express misgivings about the constitutionality of Section 5. 
    Section 5 goes beyond what is prohibited by the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    It sweeps broadly to suspend all voting changes however innocuous until they are precleared by federal authorities. 
    And some of the circumstances that we have relied on in upholding Section 5 in the past have unquestionably changed. 
    Voter turnout and registration now approach parity. 
    In the forms of blatant discrimination that were common place when the Act was passed are now rare. 
    Things have changed in the South. 
    Those improvements are no doubt doing part to the Voting Rights Act and they stand as a monument to its success. 
    But the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs. 
    The Act also differentiates between the States and ways that are intention with our fundamental tradition of equal sovereignty among the States. 
    Those distinctions may no longer be justified by current conditions. 
    For example, the racial gap between voter registration and turnout is actually lower in the States originally covered by Section 5 than it is nationwide. 
    We recognized that judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is, as Justice Holmes once put it, the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform. 
    We appreciate that the Members of Congress take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution. 
    Here, the District Court found that the sizeable record compiled by Congress in support of extending Section 5 documented continuing racial discrimination. 
    That Court also found that the preclearance requirement of Section 5 deterred discriminatory changes. 
    We will not shrink from our duty as Alexander Hamilton described it in the Federalist papers to serve as the bulwark of limited Constitution against legislative encroachments. 
    Part of defining that duty is the established principle that normally we will not decide a constitutional question if there is another ground upon which to dispose of the case. 
    Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out from the preclearance requirement and the principle of constitutional avoidance demands that we consider that claim before resting a decision on the Constitution. 
    The Act allows political subdivisions to seek to bail out from the preclearance requirements. 
    It is undisputed that the district is a political subdivision in the ordinary sense. 
    But the Act provides a narrower statutory definition under which the district does not qualify. 
    The district argues that the statutory definition is inapplicable to Section 5. 
    Now in prior cases, we have held that the statutory definition does not apply in determining what entities must seek preclearance under the Act before instituting voting changes. 
    In light of those decisions, that definition should not constrain the availability of bailout either. 
    There must be symmetry between having to preclear and being able to bail out. 
    If the statutory definition does not apply in deciding who was covered as we have held, it should not apply in deciding who is no longer covered. 
    Under the Government's contrary interpretation, the bailout provision has been all but a nullity. 
    Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions out of more than 12,000 political subdivisions covered have successfully bailed out of the Act. 
    We think it unlikely that Congress intended the bailout provision to have such limited effect. 
    We, therefore, hold that the district is eligible to seek bailout under the Act. 
    The district made clear that a favorable decision on bailout was an alternative to the ruling it seeks under the Constitution. 
    Our statutory holding, therefore, makes it unnecessary for us to reach the question of the constitutionality of Section 5 and we do not do so. 
    The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
