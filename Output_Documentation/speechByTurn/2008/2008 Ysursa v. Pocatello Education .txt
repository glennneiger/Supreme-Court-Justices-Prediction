    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning in case 07-869, Ysursa versus Pocatello Education Association. 
    Under Idaho law, a public employee may elect to have a portion of his wages deducted and remitted to his union to pay union dues. 
    But Idaho law prohibits payroll deductions for political activities. 
    So a public employee may not have a dues checkoff for the union's political action committee. 
    A group of Idaho public employee unions sued, alleging that Idaho's ban on payroll deductions for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    The First Amendment prohibits government from "abridging the freedom of speech". 
    Restrictions that single out a category of speech for disfavored treatment are presumptively invalid. 
    First Amendment does not, however, impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech. 
    A State is therefore not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas. 
    Idaho's law does not restrict political speech but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities. 
    Idaho's public employee unions are free to engage in such speech as they see fit. 
    They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor. 
    Idaho's decision to limit public employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions' First Amendment rights. 
    The State accordingly need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban. 
    Idaho's justification is the interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics. 
    And the State's response targets its source, political payroll deductions. 
    The ban plainly serves the State's interest in separating public employment from political activities. 
    Now, the union say that whether or not all that is true, that only justifies the ban at the level of state employers not local government employers. 
    But the same analysis applies whether the ban is directed at state or local government entities. 
    Political subdivisions have never been considered sovereign entities but are instead subordinate governmental instrumentalities carrying out state governmental functions. 
    Idaho's interest in separating the operation of government from parties and politics extends to all public employers at whatever level of government. 
    Now, given the relationship between the State and its political subdivisions, it is immaterial how the State allocates funding or management responsibilities between the different levels of government. 
    The First Amendment analysis does not vary depending on the level of government affected. 
    The State is not required to promote political speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities. 
    The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    And Justices Stevens and Souter have filed dissenting opinions.
