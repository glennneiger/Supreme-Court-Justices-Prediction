    Justice David H. Souter 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    AT&amp;T provides pensions and other benefits based on a seniority system. 
    The system relies on an employee's term of employment which is understood as the period of service to the company minus uncredited leave time. 
    In the 1960s and early to mid 1970s, AT&amp;T gave full service credit to employees on disability leave, but did not treat pregnancy-related absence as equivalent to disability. 
    Women including Noreen Hulteen therefore received less service credit for pregnancy leave than they would have accrued on the same leave for disability. 
    At that time, AT&amp;T's differential leave policy was lawful. 
    This Court in the case of General Electric Company against Gilbert concluded that a disability plan excluding disabilities related to pregnancy was not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of Title VII. 
    In 1979, in response to Gilbert, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act or PDA which amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and defined sex-based discrimination to include discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy. 
    In light of the change in the law, AT&amp;T promptly changed its policy and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on the same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabilities. 
    AT&amp;T did not however, make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit calculations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA policies. 
    Hulteen has now retired and if her total term of employment had not been decreased due to her pre-PDA pregnancy leave, she would be entitled to a greater pension benefit. 
    She sued AT&amp;T seeking increased benefits alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found such a violation but we now reverse. 
    Section 703(h) of Title VII expressly protects the application of different standards of compensation under the terms of a bona fide seniority system. 
    In other words, it insulates from challenge seniority systems producing differences that are not the result of an intention to discriminate. 
    Hulteen argues that AT&amp;T's differential leave policy was discriminatory and that the policy infects the seniority system making the differences, it generates the different pension pay outs, open the challenge. 
    But in light of this Court's decision in Gilbert, the fact that the -- and the fact that the PDA is not retroactive, AT&amp;T's differential leave policy cannot be considered as illegal when done and therefore, cannot be termed intentionally discriminatory. 
    AT&amp;T's seniority system is therefore a bona fide system under Section 703(h) and is insulated from challenge. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.
