    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case is before us on writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit. 
    The petitioner in this case was convicted of violating the RICO Act by participating in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. 
    The evidence at trial was sufficient to show that petitioner and other members of a loose and informal group without any hierarchal structure or long term plan committed a series of bank robberies over a period of years. 
    The District Courts during instruction on the meaning of a RICO enterprise relied primarily on our decision in United States v. Turkette. 
    The question presented is whether the Court erred in refusing to give a requested defense instruction to the effect that an association in fact enterprise under RICO must have “an ascertainable structure” beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages. 
    We hold that an enterprise must have certain structural features but not those identified by petitioner and that an instruction that refers specifically to the concept of structure is not necessary. 
    We therefore hold that the District Court properly instructed the jury in this case and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer has joined.
