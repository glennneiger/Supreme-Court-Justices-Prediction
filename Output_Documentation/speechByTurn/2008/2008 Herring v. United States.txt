    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning in case 07-513, Herring versus United States. 
    This is a case about whether the police can use evidence they find as a result of a mistaken arrest. 
    The petitioner, Bennie Dean Herring, went to the Sheriff's Department to retrieve something from his impounded truck. 
    An office who saw him asked the Sheriff's Department warrant clerk to check to see if there was an outstanding warrant for Herring's arrest, there was not. 
    The officer then asked the clerk to check with her counterpart in the neighboring county, the clerk did check and that clerk checked her computer and said, “Yes, there was a warrant for Herring's arrest.” 
    Acting on that information, the officer promptly arrested Herring and found methamphetamine and a gun that Herring as a felon was not allowed to possess. 
    It turned out, however, that the clerk from the other county was wrong and she went to retrieve an actual copy of the warrant, she discovered that it had been recalled. 
    That fact should have been noted in the computer database, but was not. 
    She immediately called the other warrant clerk who immediately called the officer. 
    All of that took place in about 10 to 15 minutes, but Herring had already been arrested during that time. 
    Now, when Herring was prosecuted, he argued that the Government should not be allowed to use the drugs or the gun as evidence against him because they have been discovered as a result of an unlawful arrest. 
    The lower courts disagreed concluding that the evidence could be admitted even though the arrest was unlawful. 
    We granted certiorari to review that determination. 
    The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution forbids “unreasonable searches and seizures.” 
    We've held that usually requires the police to have probable cause or a warrant before arresting someone. 
    Now, here, Herring and the Government both agreed that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because there was no warrant. 
    We do not decide that issue. 
    The issue instead is assuming that the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment must the evidence seized be excluded. 
    Our cases have applied what is knows as the exclusionary rule under which illegally seized evidence cannot be admitted in court. 
    This is a judicially creative rule. 
    It is not an individual right, but instead, aims to deter violations of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The idea is that if the police cannot use evidence from an illegal search, there is likely to be fewer illegal searches. 
    Now, given that purpose, our precedents establish that the rule does not apply when it will not result in real deterrence or when the benefits of any deterrents are outweighed by the cost. 
    The cost of course is the prospect that the guilty and possibly dangerous will go free. 
    Now, to the extent that our case has justified applying the exclusionary rule, we have said that it depends not only on its deterrent affect, but also on the culpability of the police. 
    If you look at the cases in which we developed the exclusionary rule, you will see that they involved deliberate and flagrant violations of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The bookkeeping negligence here is a far cry from those concerns. 
    The negligent error here was neither reckless nor widespread. 
    Not only was the conduct here less culpable than in the cases in which we developed the exclusionary rule. 
    That fact also means that there is likely to be little deterrence from excluding the evidence. 
    In a case such as this, we agree with Judge Cardozo's famous statement that the criminal should not go free because the constable has blundered. 
    The evidence here need not be kept form the jury. 
    The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer have joined. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.
