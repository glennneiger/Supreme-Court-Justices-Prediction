    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Respondent confessed that he stabbed his 19-year old cousin nine times and shot her four times. 
    She died. 
    At trial, he entered pleas not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity which under state law required a bifurcated trial. 
    During the first phase, respondent attempted to avoid first-degree murder conviction and instead obtain a second-degree murder conviction by presenting medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and thus incapable of premeditation or deliberation. 
    The jury nonetheless convicted respondent a first-degree murder. 
    Respondent's counsel then recommended that he abandon his not guilty by reason of insanity plea. 
    Counsel believed that the jury was unlikely to accept an insanity defense which would have been based on medical testimony similar to evidence presented in the first phase. 
    Also, counsel's plan to supplement the medical evidence during the second phase with testimony from respondent's parents failed when the parents refused to testify. 
    Respondent accepted his attorney's advice and withdrew his insanity defense. 
    In state post-conviction proceedings, respondent alleged that the recommendation to withdraw the insanity defense constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the Court -- this Court's decision in Strickland versus Washington. 
    The state trial court denied relief and the California Court of Appeals affirmed. Respondent next applied for federal habeas which the District Court denied. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed ordering an evidentiary hearing on counsel's recommendations to withdraw the insanity defense. 
    On remand, the Magistrate Judge found that counsel had made a carefully reasoned decision not to proceed with the insanity defense. 
    The Magistrate Judge nonetheless concluded that the District Court was bound by the Court of Appeals' remand order to determine only whether counsel had tactical reason for abandoning the defense. 
    Because the Magistrate Judge found that respondent had “nothing to lose by proceeding with the insanity defense” the Magistrate Judge held that counsel's performance was deficient. 
    As to prejudice, the Magistrate Judge concluded that the District Court was similarly bound by the remand order because the Court of Appeals had described the insanity defense as remaining viable and strong. 
    The Court of Appeal -- the District Court accepted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and granted the writ of habeas corpus. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    In 2007, we granted the state's petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' opinion and remanded for further consideration in light of our decision in Carey versus Musladin which addressed the proper method for evaluating whether a state court decision “involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court for the purposes of granting federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, AEDPA. 
    On remand, the Court of Appeals concluded that its decision was unaffected by Musladin and again, affirmed the grant of habeas corpus. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We conclude that the state court's denial of respondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not violate clearly established federal law. 
    The Court of Appeals reached a contrary result in large part because it blamed counsel for abandoning the insanity defense when there was “nothing to lose” by pursuing it. 
    But this Court has not established anything akin to a nothing to lose standard. 
    Thus, habeas corpus is warranted only if the state court decision unreasonably apply the general Strickland standard for ineffective assistance claims. 
    It did not. 
    Furthermore, respondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim would fail even under de novo review. 
    Strickland requires a defendant to establish efficient performance and prejudice. 
    Respondent has established neither. 
    He has not shown that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by recommending the withdrawal of a defense that he reasonably believed was destined for failure. 
    Respondent is also unable to show that there is a reasonable probability that he would have prevailed on his insanity defense had he pursued it. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justices Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg joined all but Part II of the opinion.
