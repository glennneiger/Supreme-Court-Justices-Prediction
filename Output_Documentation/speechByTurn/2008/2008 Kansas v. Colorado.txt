    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This is an original action between the states of Kansas and Colorado concerning the Arkansas River, and the matter now before us concerns Kansas' exception to the Special Master's Fifth and Final Report. 
    Kansas is the prevailing party in this case for the purpose of awarding costs. 
    And the issue before us relates to Kansas' application to recover its expert witness fees as costs. 
    The Special Master concluded that 28 U.S.C. Section 1821(b) which sets the witness attendance fee for a proceeding in any court of the United States at $40 per day applies to cases within this Court's original jurisdiction. 
    Kansas argues that this provision was not meant to apply to cases within our original jurisdiction, and that, in any event Congress lacks the authority to set the fees that are recoverable in such cases. 
    We assume for the sake of argument that 28 U.S.C. Section 1821(b) is not controlling, and that the question of expert fees in original cases is left entirely to our discretion. 
    We nevertheless hold that the amount prescribed by that statutory provision is the appropriate amount in this case. 
    We see no good reason why the rule for recovering expert witness fees should differ markedly depending on whether a case is originally brought in one of the District Courts or in this Court. 
    It is our view that the best approach is to have a uniform rule concerning witness attendance fees that applies in all federal cases. 
    For the reasons set out in our opinion we therefore overrule Kansas' exception and approved the entry of the proposed judgment and decree. The judgment of the Court is unanimous. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.
