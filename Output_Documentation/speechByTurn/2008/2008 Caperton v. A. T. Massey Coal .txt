    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The first case to announce is Caperton versus A.T. Massey Coal Company, No. 08-22. The case concerns whether the Due Process Clause requires a judge to recuse himself when a person with a personal stake in the outcome of the case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case. 
    In 2002, a West Virginia jury in a state court returned the verdict that found respondent Massey Coal Company liable in a civil suit. 
    The jury awarded petitioner, Hugh Caperton $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Don Blankenship is Massey Coals' Chairman, President and CEO. 
    Massey Coal had been the defendant before the jury. 
    After the verdict -- before appeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections, knowing the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal in this case. 
    Blankenship decided to support Brent Benjamin to replace an incumbent judgment on the state's highest court. 
    In total, Blankenship contributed some $3 million to get Benjamin elected. 
    And to provide some perspective, Blankenship's contributions were more than the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by Benjamin's own campaign committee. 
    Justice Benjamin won the election by 50,000 votes. 
    When the state court's highest court decided to hear Massey Coal's appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution based on the conflict clause by Blankenship's campaign involvement. 
    Justice Benjamin denied that motion. 
    And the state court ruled three-to-two in favor of Blankenship and Massey Coal with Justice Benjamin casting the deciding vote. 
    Then there was a petition for rehearing. 
    After two justices recuse themselves, the court granted rehearing. 
    Justice Benjamin though twice more refused to recuse himself. 
    The newly constituted court again voted three-to-two to overturn the $50 million jury verdict again with Justice Benjamin casting the deciding vote. 
    We granted certiorari to consider whether Justice Benjamin was constitutionally required to recuse himself. 
    We conclude and we now hold that his recusal was required by the constitution requirement of due process. 
    At the outset, we note that Justice Benjamin was careful to address the recusal motions and explained his reasons why disqualification was not in order. 
    He conducted -- Justice Benjamin conducted a probing inquiry into his actual motives and inclinations and he found none to be improper, and we do not question his subjective findings of impartially. 
    Nor do we determine whether there was actual bias. 
    Judge Benjamin properly undertook an extensive search for actual bias. 
    But as our prior cases have indicated, this is just one step in the judicial process. 
    Due process may sometimes require recusal whether or not actual bias exists or can be proved. 
    The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias and the fact that the inquiries often a private one simply underscore the need for objective rules. 
    Otherwise, there may be no adequate protection against the judge who simply misreads or misapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case. 
    The judge's only inquiry into actual bias then is not one that the law can easily superintend or review. Of course actual bias if disclosed. 
    No doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief. 
    In lieu of exclusive reliance on that personal inquiry or another appellate review of the judge's determination respecting actual bias, the Due Process Clause has been implemented by objective standards that do not require proof of actual bias. 
    In defining the standards, the Court has asked whether under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness, the interest poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented. 
    Turning to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias based on objective and reasonable perceptions. 
    Here, a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by making campaign contributions. And this was all when the case was pending. 
    To be sure not every -- or eminent -- to be sure not every campaign contributions by a litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge's recusal. 
    But this is an exceptional case. 
    Blankenship contributed $3 million to get Benjamin elected. His contributions eclipsed the total amount spent by all other -- spent by all other Benjamin supporters and exceeded by 300% the amount spent by Benjamin's committee. 
    The risk Blankenship's influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial but it must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented. 
    The facts before us are extreme by any measure. 
    And state and federal codes of judicial conduct impose more rigorous standards than due process requires. 
    And as a result, most disputes of a disqualification can resolve without resort to the constitution. 
    The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is reversed. 
    The case is remanded for further proceeding not inconsistent with this opinion. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito have joined. 
    And Justice Scalia has also filed a separate dissenting opinion.
