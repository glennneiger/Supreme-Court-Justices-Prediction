    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have the opinion for the Court in the other tax case Number 07-308 United Stated versus Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Company. 
    Under the Internal Revenue Code, a tax payer seeking a refund of taxes unlawfully assessed must file a refund claim with the IRS before bringing suit. 
    This refund claim must be filed within three years of the filing of the tax return. 
    Read together, these provisions may clear that a tax payer cannot bring suit against the Government for a refund unless a claim has been filed with the IRS within the time limits that I just described. 
    The respondents in this case are three coal companies who were subject to a tax on coal exports. 
    In 1998, that tax was held to be unconstitutional under the Export Clause of the Constitution which states that "No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State." 
    Now, after the coal tax was invalidated, the companies sought refunds of the taxes they had paid. 
    For taxes paid between 1997 and 1999, the companies complied with the refund scheme just described and their taxes were refunded in full, with interest. 
    They could not, however, comply with the code's refund procedures for taxes paid between 1994 and 1996. 
    So for those, they went straight to Court under general provisions allowing suit against the Government. 
    Those provisions have a six-year statute of limitations more generous than the code provisions. 
    The Court of Appeals let them do that but we will not. 
    The outcome here is clear given the plain language of the relevant statutes Section 7422 of the code states that, "No suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or of any sum alleged to have been excessive, or in any banner wrongfully collected until a claim a for refund has been filed with the IRS. 
    What's more, the time limits for filing such a claim with the IRS apply to any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Given that language, we don't think there can be any doubt that the statute covers the taxes that issue here and bars the company's suit. 
    Now the companies argue for a different result here, because the coal tax at issue was assessed in violation of the Export Clause, but it is well establish that constitutional claims can be time barred and that they can be subject to administrative exhaust in requirements. 
    We do not see anything special about the Export Clause or about the taxes that issue here that would justify overwriting the plain language of the statutes. 
    We reversed the judgment below, our opinion is unanimous.
