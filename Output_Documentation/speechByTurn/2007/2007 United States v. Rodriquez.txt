    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    You can see how anxious I am to make this announcement.[Laughter] 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit. 
    Respondent Rodriquez was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. 
    Under the Arms Career Criminal Act, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years if he had three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense. 
    At issue here is whether two of respondents, three convictions in Washington state court for delivery of a controlled substance were serious drug offenses. 
    Serious drug offenses are defined as drug trafficking offenses "for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law". 
    Under Washington law, the maximum sentence for delivery of a controlled substance was five years for a first offence but 10 years for subsequent offenses. 
    Thus, under these Washington statutes, respondent could have been sentenced to 10 years for the two convictions in questions but the sentencing court did not impose the maximum term. 
    The Ninth Circuit held that these convictions did not qualify as serious drug offenses because the maximum term of imprisonment should be determined without reference to recidivist enhancements. 
    Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's holding, however, the convictions in question fall within the literal meaning of the definition of the serious drug offense, that is they were drug offenses for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years was prescribed by law. 
    For this reason and others set out an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit. 
    Justice Souter has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.
