Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    As -- as part of its effort to deregulate trucking industry, Congress prohibited States from enacting any law "related to the price, route or service of a motor carrier". 
    Now, the question in this case is whether that federal law I just read preempts, i.e. sets aside to Maine tobacco laws. 
    The first law requires sellers, who ship tobacco into Maine, to use a shipping company that will make certain that the person, who receives and signs for the package is over 18, and is the same person as the one who brought the tobacco. 
    The second law assumes that the carrier knows that a package that's marked in a certain way will be shipped from certain people, contains tobacco and then therefore is illegal to transport under Maine law, under certain circumstances. 
    Now, in our view, both of these provisions do amount for the state regulation of a service, a service of a motor carrier and the federal law forbids the State from doing that. 
    In Morales versus Trans World Airlines, we said a -- similar federal language preempts at the least those state statutes that have a "connection" with the services that carriers provide and at least have a significant negative impact upon what Congress was trying to achieve in this deregulatory statute. 
    These two particular Maine laws fail these tests. 
    The first one amounts to a state rule that requires carriers to provide a particular set of tobacco recipient verification services, it's a very detailed thing they have to provide there and those services that under if there were deregulation of services, the companies would have their choice to provide them or not as they chose. 
    So the Maine law stops them from having their services as you have to do it. 
    The second law in effect requires a carrier specially to check all the packages that go to Maine to see whether those markings are there or not or who they were sent by. 
    Again, the federal statute leaves it up to the carriers to choose whatever checking methods they want to choose, subject to federal regulation, not the state regulation. 
    This isn't to say that the carriers are automatically exempt from all state regulation, but they are at least exempt from the specific detailed state regulation that's aimed directly at carriers and designed to substitute state service mandates for those of the carriers on choice, which is what we have here. 
    Maine's primary counter-arguments focus on the fact that if the laws serve desirable, health-related purposes, namely to help prevent minors from obtaining tobacco and we assume that is an excellent purpose, but still the federal statute governs and the federal statute doesn't provide a health related exemption. 
    And if we try to read that into that, we would somehow -- suddenly permit a vast web of state regulation covering all kinds of products and potentially varying from one state to another which his precisely what Congress did not want. 
    Maine statutes here essentially seek to conscript the carriers into Maine's efforts to help -- help them regulate tobacco sales. 
    They have more than a peripheral or indirect effect on carriers. 
    They don't present a borderline case. 
    We consequently need not decide just when a regulation's effect upon carriers is too remote the warrant preemption. 
    So we affirm the Court of Appeals decision. 
    Everyone agrees to that result. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part.
