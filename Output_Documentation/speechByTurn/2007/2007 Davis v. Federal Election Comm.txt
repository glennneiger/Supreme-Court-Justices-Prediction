    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    And this case comes to us on appeal from United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
    Federal campaign finance law limits the contributions to candidates for the House of Representatives may receive from individuals and political parties. 
    These limits generally apply equally to all candidates. 
    However, Section 319 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, part of the so-called, “Millionaires Amendment,” departs from this general rule. 
    When a self-financing candidate spends more than $350,000 of personal funds and certain other conditions are met. 
    Section 319(a) expands the normal contribution limits but only for the candidate's non-self-financing opponent. 
    To make it possible to tell when this -- a symmetrical regime applies, Section 319(b) requires the self-financing candidate to disclose certain information about his or her personal campaign expenditures. 
    Appellant Jack Davis, a candidate for the House in 2004 and 2006 challenged the constitutionality of Sections 319(a) and (b). 
    A three-judge panel with the District Court concluded that Davis had standing but rejected his challenge on the merits, and Davis appealed to this Court. 
    We agree that Davis possesses spending and that his claims are not moved. 
    However, we conclude that Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment and we therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    If Section 319(a)'s expanded contribution limits were available to both self-financing and non-self-financing candidates, Davis would have no constitutional claim. 
    By expanding contribution limits only for non-self-financing candidates however, Section 319 (a) burdens the self-financing candidate's right in the words of Buckley versus Valeo to spend personal funds to, "vigorously and tirelessly advocate his own election." 
    Section 319(a) does this because if a candidate vigorously exercises the right to use personal funds for campaign speech that candidate's opponent obtains substantial and unprecedented fund raising advantages. 
    This burden is not justified by any compelling state interest. 
    Reliance on personal funds rather than campaign contributions reduces, rather than increases the threat of corruption and perception of corruption. 
    And we have never recognized the interest that the Government has asserted in defending the constitutionality of this provision, that is an interest in leveling electoral opportunities as a legitimate Government interest. 
    Endorsing that interest would have ominous implications for voter's authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates for public office. 
    Because Section 319(a)'s asymmetrical contribution regime imposes a significant burden on First Amendment rights that is not justified by a compelling state interest that cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny. 
    And because Section 319(b)'s disclosure requirements exist merely to implement Section 319(a)'s unconstitutional regime to burden those requirements, imposes likewise unwarranted. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer have joined in part. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Breyer has joined.
