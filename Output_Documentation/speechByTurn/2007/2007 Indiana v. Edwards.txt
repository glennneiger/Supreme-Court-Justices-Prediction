    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The second case -- the third case is not so complicated. 
    Here, a state court, that's Indiana v. Edwards, a state court found the criminal defendant in this case competent to stand trial if he was represented by counsel, mentally competent. 
    But he is not mentally competent to conduct the trial proceedings himself without a counsel, that’s what the trial judge said. 
    The Indiana State Supreme Court concluded that this Court's precedents don't allow that, that they require the trial court to allow the defendant, nonetheless, to conduct the trial proceedings himself. 
    So, we have to decide whether that’s so. 
    Does the constitution forbid a State from insisting that the defendant like this who the State thinks is not competent mentally to conduct the proceedings himself? 
    Does it forbid a State for insisting that such a defendant proceed to trial with a lawyer, not without one? 
    Thereby, denying the defendant the right to represent himself under the Sixth Amendment which we have explained the case called Faretta. 
    We conclude that the State may insist a defendant be represented by counsel where that defendant is not mentally competent to conduct the trial proceedings himself. 
    First, in our view, the relevant precedents do not decide the question presented here. 
    They assume the constitutional right of self representation. 
    They assume that that right set forth in Faretta can be limited in various ways. 
    Second, the mental competency that a defendant needs to represent himself during the trial, can differ dramatically from the mental competency he needs to proceed to trial with a lawyer, and third, to permit a defendant to represent himself a trial when he is mentally incompetent to do so. 
    In our opinion, does not at all affirmed that defendant's dignity but rather it threatens to undermine the most basic of the constitution's criminal law objectives, namely, providing a fair trial. 
    We add that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the presence or degree of the defendant’s mental competence. 
    And we conclude that the State may insist that a criminal defendant be represented by counsel at the trial when that defendant who is mentally competent to stand trial with a lawyer, is not mentally competent to stand trial without one. 
    And these points which are a little abstract, are very concretely and very well-represented by the facts of this case right before us which are explained in the opinion. 
    So, we vacate the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.
