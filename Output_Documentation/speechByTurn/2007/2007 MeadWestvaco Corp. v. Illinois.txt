    Remarkably enough, we have two tax opinions to announce today. 
    The first is by Justice Alito.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This is Meadwestvaco Corporation versus Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois. 
    The petitioner is a successor in interest to the Mead Corporation, an Ohio Corporation, engaged in the production and sale of paper goods. 
    The respondent is the Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    We have been asked to decide whether a tax levied by Illinois on an apportioned share of the capital gain that Mead realized in 1994, violates the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. 
    In 1994, Mead realized the capital gain on the sale of one of its divisions, the online research service Lexis/Nexis. 
    The State of Illinois took the position that an apportioned share of this gain was taxable in Illinois. 
    Mead paid the tax under protest and filed this suit in state court. 
    The trial court found that Lexis/Nexis was not part of the unitary business that Mead conducted in Illinois, but that the State could nevertheless tax an apportioned share of the gain because Lexis/Nexis serves an operational function in that business. 
    The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed. 
    It agreed that Lexis served an operational function in Meadâ€™s business and did not reach the question whether Lexis and Mead formed a unitary business. 
    As we explain at greater length in the opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, the concept of operational function simply identifies one way in which an asset can form part of the tax payer's unitary business. 
    The operational function test, as the state courts termed it, was not intended to supplement the unitary business principle with a separate ground for apportionment. 
    Once the Court determines that two businesses are not unitary, the constitutional inquiry is generally at an end. 
    The trial court here found that Lexis and Mead were not unitary, but the Appellate Court of Illinois, relying on its operational function analysis, made no such determination. 
    It is free to consider that question on remand and we express no opinion on it now. 
    The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is vacated and this matter is remanded to that Court for further proceedings, not inconsistent with our opinion. 
    The judgment of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.
