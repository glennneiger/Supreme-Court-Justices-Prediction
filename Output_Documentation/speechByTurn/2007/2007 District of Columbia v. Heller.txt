    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you can bear with me, I -- I can do it. 
    This case is hereon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    District of Columbia law bans handgun possession by making it a crime to carry an unregistered firearm, prohibiting the registration of handguns and providing separately that no person may carry a handgun not licensed by the chief of police who was authorized to issue one year licenses. 
    In addition, it requires residents to keep lawfully owned firearms which would include long guns, unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device. 
    Respondent Heller, a D.C. special policeman, applied to register a handgun he wished to keep at home, but the District refused. 
    He filed this suit seeking, on Second Amendment grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the ban on handgun registration, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of functional firearms in the home. 
    The District Court dismissed the suit, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to posses firearms and that the city's total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self defense, violated this right. 
    The Court of Appeals directed the District Court to enter summary judgment for respondent. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    We hold that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have unused arms for self defense in the home and that the District's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be rendered inoperative, violates that right. 
    Our opinion is very lengthy examining in detail, the text and history of the Second Amendment. 
    This summary that I'm giving will state little more than the conclusions. 
    If you want to check their validity against the dissents' contrary claims, you will have to read some 154 pages of opinions. 
    The Second Amendment provides "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” 
    The interpretive difficulty and what causes some people to think that it confers only a collective, rather than an individual right, and others including the petitioners here to think that it isn't individual right but only to keep and bear arms for service in a militia. 
    The interpretive difficulty that produces those positions is of course the prologue, a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State. 
    It's a standard principle of interpretation and was in 1791 that a prologue cannot limit the scope of the operative text which often goes beyond the narrow purpose set forth in a prologue. 
    It would be peculiar, however, for the prologue positively to contradict the text. 
    So, we examine first the operative portion of the amendment, namely, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. 
    We conclude after examining many uses of keep arms and bear arms, contemporaneous with and prior to the adoption of the Second Amendment that it means pretty much what it means today to have and carry weapons. 
    Those old sources refute the notion that bear arms alone or keep in bear arms in combination has an exclusively military connotation. 
    To be sure when one was a soldier, he bore arms, but one could bear arms without being a soldier. 
    The same conclusion that the phrase does not refer to military service is demanded by the fact that it was universally understood that the Second Amendment incorporated in to the Federal Constitution, a preexisting right of Englishman set forth in the 1689 English Bill of Rights, that's why it reads shall not be infringed, the right shall not be infringed, referring to a preexisting right and everybody agrees with that. 
    There is no doubt that the English right was an individual right to have and carry arms. 
    We then turn to the prologue to see if it is incompatible with the interpretation we have given the operative clause, it is not. 
    In fact, that interpretation that she is the object of the prologue more effectively than would a mere right to have and bear arms in an organized militia. 
    The militia consisted of all male citizens capable of military service. 
    That was thought to be a protection against, not only attack from abroad, but tyranny at home. 
    In the events that had given rise to the English Bill of Rights, the Stuart Kings had not abolished the people's militia, but had simply taken away the people's arms or the arms of their opponents, leaving in place only a standing army and a select militia dominated by their own supporters. 
    The lesson learned, if the people cannot have arms, there will be no people's militia. 
    That perception is what joins the two part of -- the two parts of the Second Amendment. 
    The mere right to keep and bear arms in a State organized militia does not solve the problem because of the state court like the Stuart Kings limit the organized militia to its own people. 
    So, what the Second Amendment means is since we need a people's militia, the people will not be deprived of the right to keep and bear arms. 
    This interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms bearing rights in state constitutions that preceeded and immediately followed the adoption of the Second Amendment. 
    Of the four States that had analogues to the Federal Second Amendment before the Constitution was ratified, two clearly conferred individual rights unconnected to militia service specifying the people's right to bear arms for their own defense and the most likely reading is that the other two also secured an individual right to bear arms for defensive purposes. 
    Similarly of the nine States -- of the nine State analogues to the Second Amendment that were adopted between 1789 and 1820, seven referred to the people's right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State or to the citizens right to bear arms in defense of himself and the State. 
    The final two of those nine -- of those nine were ambiguous but were interpreted by the state courts to confer an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes. 
    Our opinion then looks at legal interpretations of the Second Amendment from immediately after its ratification through the 19th Century. 
    We find that that scholars, including the most famous ones, Tucker, Rolls, Storey and Cooley, the adjudicated cases, congressional legislation and the statements of congressional legislators, universally, took the right to be a personal one unconnected to militia service. 
    The one exception is a minor scholar who acknowledged that his view had been rejected. 
    As one might expect, after the civil war, the right of the former slaves, a new freemen to bear arms was a significant issue. 
    Let me read from a joint congressional report dated 1866. 
    In some parts of South Carolina, armed parties are without proper authority, engaged in seizing all firearms found in the hands of freemen. 
    Such conduct is in clear and direct violation of their personal rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States which declares that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. 
    The congressional act creating the Freedmen's Bureau on July 16, 1866 stated the right to have full and equal benefit of all laws in proceedings concerning personal liberty and personal security including the constitutional right to bear arms shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens without respect to race or color or previous condition of slavery. 
    It was good to have a gun when -- when the clansmen came. 
    Our opinion next turns to whether any prior decisions of this Court preclude the interpretation we have just described. 
    We conclude that none does. 
    I will only describe one of those cases on which the dissent places its principle reliance and that is our decision in United States versus Miller rendered in 1939. 
    The judgment in that case upheld against a Second Amendment challenge, two men's federal convictions for transporting an unregistered sawed off shut gun in interstate commerce in violation of the National Firearms Act. 
    It is entirely clear that the Court's basis for saying that the Second Amendment did not prevent the conviction was not that the defendants were bearing arms privately rather than in a militia, rather it was that the type of weapon that issued was not illegible for Second Amendment protection. 
    "In the absence of any evidence tending to show that the possession or use of a short barreled shotgun at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument." 
    Certainly, the Court continued, “It is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense." 
    Beyond that, the opinion provided no explanation of the content of the right to keep and bear arms. 
    This holding is not only consistent with but positively suggests that the Second Amendment confers a right to keep and bear arms for lawful private purposes. 
    Had the Court believed that the Second Amendment protects only those service -- those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the two crooks were not militia men. 
    Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. 
    It is particularly wrong headed to read Miller for more than what it said because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment. 
    The respondent made no appearance in the case, neither filing a brief nor appearing at oral argument, the Court heard from no one but the Government, reason enough, one would think not to make that case the beginning and the end of this Court's consideration of the Second Amendment. 
    The Government's Miller brief provided scant discussion of the history of the Second Amendment and the Court was presented with no counter discussion. 
    As for the text of the Court's opinion, that -- as for the text of the Court's opinion itself, that discusses none of the history of the Second Amendment. 
    It assumes from the prologue that the amendment was designed to preserve the militia which we do not dispute and then we view some historical materials dealing with the nature of the militia and in particular with the nature of the arms their members were expected to posses, not a word, not a word about the history of the Second Amendment. 
    The next section of our opinion points out that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. 
    It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, and for whatever purpose. 
    For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the amendment or state analogues. 
    Our opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on long standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. 
    Miller is holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those "in common use of the time," finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. 
    We make no attempt to provide and no excuse for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible since this case represents the Court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field. 
    There will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for these exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us. 
    Finally, we come to our disposition of the case, the District's handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement, at least as applied to immediate self defense which is all that the respondent asked for, violates the Second Amendment. 
    The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to prohibition all of -- of an entire class of arms that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self defense. 
    Under any of the standards of scrutiny, the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition in the place where the need for lawful defense of self, family and property is most acute would fail constitutional muster. 
    Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional, because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for reliefs -- for relief and so we do not address the licensing requirement. 
    Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights by being a felon or mentally ill for example, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it at home. 
    We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country and we take seriously the concerns raised by the many Amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution. 
    The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem including some measures regulating handguns, but the Second Amendment necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table. 
    These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home. 
    Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing armies in pride of our nation where a well-trained police forces provide personal security and where a gun violence is a serious problem, that is perhaps debatable. 
    But what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Stevens has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer have joined. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsberg have joined.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The two dissenting opinions that Justice Breyer and I have filed set forth independent reasons for concluding that the Court is quite wrong today. 
    The fact that individuals may enforce the right protected by the Second Amendment tells us nothing about the scope of the right. 
    Guns are used to hunt, for self defense, to commit crimes, for sporting activities and to perform military duties. 
    The Second Amendment plainly does not protect the right to use a gun to rob a bank. 
    It is equally clear that it does encompass the right to use weapons for certain military purposes, Whether it also protects the right to -- to posses and use guns for non-military purposes like hunting and personal self defense is the question presented by this case. 
    Rather than attempt to summarize my lengthy opinion, I shall merely identify eight reasons why most judges would endorse the narrower, militia related reading of the amendment. 
    First, it is the most natural reading of the 27-word text. 
    That text protects the right to keep and bear arms and makes no mention of any non-military use of a firearm. 
    It protects the preexisting right to use guns by members of a militia. 
    The centerpiece of the Court's analysis of the text today is its assumption that the words "the people" describe the same class of persons as those words described in the First and Fourth Amendments, all members of the political community, not in unspecified subset like just the militia. 
    But it is well established that the people protected by the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment include convicted felons and mentally incompetent persons and many that are not capable of handling firearms. 
    The Court assures us, however, that law abiding and responsible citizens are the only subset of people entitled to bear arms. 
    But that assurance which comes at the end of the opinion totally eviscerates the basis for the Court's elaborate attempt to justify its claim that the text means more than it says and serves a purpose far broader than that identified in its preamble. 
    Second, if the text were ambiguous and the long discussion of language in the Court's opinion may support its clearer that it is ambiguous at the very least, I don't think it is ambiguous, but if it were, the clear statement of purpose in its preamble would provide the basis for -- for resolving any ambiguity. 
    The preamble clearly contemplates the use of arms in a militia. 
    Third, the principle draftsman of the amendment, James Madison, not man who wrote generations later and commentators and so, James Madison and those who participated in the deliberations leading to the enactment of the amendment considered and rejected proposal similar to those contained in some contemporary State Constitutions which the majority opinion quotes at length which would have protected none military uses of weapons. 
    Thus a fair analysis of the original intent of the framers of the amendment supports a narrower reading. 
    Fourth, it is the reading that this Court adopted in 1939 in Miller, an unanimous opinion which speaks for itself, do not accept the summary of the opinion you have just heard. 
    For example, the concern about only one party participating in the argument was also true of Marbury against Madison, a case which should not be ignored just for that reason. 
    The word stare decisis which do not appear in the majority opinion today would normally compel -- would normally counsel adherence to settled law. 
    Fifth, no previously unavailable historical evidence has surfaced since the 1939 when Miller was described the decided nor does the Court rely on any such evidence as a basis for distinguishing Miller in making a new law and is making a new law today. 
    Sixth, not only hundreds of federal judges but also countless legislatures have relied on the view endorsed in Miller, the view was perfectly clear to them. 
    Seventh, regulation of the civilian use of firearms raises complex and critically important questions of public policy that have heretofore and resolve exclusively by the political branches of our Government, this Court should stay out of that political thicket. 
    Eighth, the chasm between the Court's rather grandiose and detailed analysis and its narrow holding demonstrates that this is just the first in the series of decisions that the Court will be required to make in order to define the dimensions of its newly discovered right. 
    The Courts claim that the amendment was a codification of a common law rule, not mentioned any memo is fully consistent with an expectation that its dimensions, the dimensions of the rule must be determined by the process of common law, case-by-case adjudication. 
    Unlike other common law rules, however, and especially those fashioned in England and particularly the English Bill of Rights Rule, this rule is not subject to amendment by the legislature. 
    Justice Breyer's separate dissent an opinion explains why at a minimum the District of Columbia's laws amount to reasonable and appropriate regulation consistent with the Second Amendment. 
    He explains that there is no sound basis -- sound legal basis for launching the Courts on the formidable and perilous mission began today. 
    In our view, there is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in urban areas. 
    It was only a few years after the decision in Miller that Justice Frankfurter wrote his famous opinion, warning of the perils of this Court's into a -- entry into a political thicket. 
    The political thicket that the Court has decided to enter today is different from but no less controversial than the one that concerned Justice Frankfurter, a genuine judicial conservative. 
    What impact the Court's totally unnecessary entry into this attainable will have on the ongoing debate between the advocates and opponents of gun control and indeed, on this Court's role as a guardian of the rule of law in a matter that will be debated by future historians at length. 
    It is, however, clear to us that adherence through a policy of judicial restraint would be far wiser than the bold decision announced today.
