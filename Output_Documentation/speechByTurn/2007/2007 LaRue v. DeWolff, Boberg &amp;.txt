    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In the first of the two cases, LaRue against the DeWolff Associates, the case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The petitioner filed the action against his former employer in the defined contribution punishment -- pension plan that it administers. 
    The plan permits participants such as LaRue to direct the investment of their contributions in accordance with specified procedures and requirements. 
    He alleges that the plan administrator failed to follow his investment directions and that that failure resulted in the depletion of the value of his interest in the plan by approximately $150,000 and that that failure was a – a breach of duty under the terms of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA. 
    The District Court granted the respondent's motion for a judgment on the pleadings and the Court of the Appeals affirmed. 
    Relying on our opinion in the -- the Russel case, the Court of Appeals held that ERISA, Section 502(a)(2) provides remedies only for entire plans and not for specific individuals. 
    We granted certiorari and now vacate and remand for further proceedings. 
    For reasons stated in our opinion, we hold that although 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plain injuries, the provision does authorize recovery for – for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant's individual account. 
    The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment that Justice Kennedy has joined. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment that Justice Scalia has joined.
