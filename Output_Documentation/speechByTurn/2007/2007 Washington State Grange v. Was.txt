Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="16.056">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument first today in case 06-713, Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party et al., consolidated with 06-730, Washington v. Washington State Republican Party et al.. 
    General McKenna.
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="16.056" stopTime="70.567">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In adopting Initiative 872, Washington's voters followed this Court's guidance in California Democratic Party v. Jones. 
    They adopted a top-two election system. 
    By so doing the voters eliminated the crucial constitutional defect of a partisan blanket primary because in the top-two system the voters are no longer selecting the party's nominees for the November election. 
    The Ninth Circuit nonetheless ruled that Initiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that allowing each candidate to state his or her personal party preference on the ballot would create the appearance of association between a political party and candidate. 
    The Ninth Circuit is wrong for at least two reasons. 
    First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance... of-association conclusion assumes that top-two ballots will look the same as ballots under a party nominating election system. 
    They will not. 
    The top-two ballot--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="70.567" stopTime="77.299">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Can you give us assurance that they will not? 
    I take it we don't... we haven't had an election under this system, so we don't know what the ballots are going to look like.
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="77.299" stopTime="129.151">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    That's correct. 
    We have not had an election, and the secretary of state was enjoined by the district court before having the opportunity to promulgate the regulations governing the ballot after 872's adoption. 
    However, Your Honor, we may look to the declaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of state did have the opportunity to promulgate, which appears in the corrected joint appendix at pages 592-593. 
    And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that, unlike the old declaration of candidacy form, we have the candidates declaring themselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and instead of saying that they're a candidate of a party, they say... that you have an opportunity to check off the box that my party preference is blank or I'm... I am an independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if they check neither box, that will be left blank on the ballot.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="129.151" stopTime="159.219">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    But you say that the purpose of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is simply to convey useful information to voters, but once you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you limit candidates to the names of parties? 
    Why don't you allow them to pick some other phrase that better expresses their point of view? 
    Somebody may want to say, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the no-new-taxes candidate. 
    Why do you limit them to saying Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="159.219" stopTime="184.520">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Your Honor, the voters could have chosen to allow candidates to include other information. 
    In fact, in the State's earliest days candidates were given five words they could use for whatever expression they wished. 
    But the voters chose to allow an expression of party preference, which the State is allowed to do. 
    The State is not required to allow the ballot to be a form... forum for political expression, but the State is allowed to do so and has chosen to do in this way.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="184.520" stopTime="196.157">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    What is that and wasn't the purpose that was offered by the proponent of the initiative to try to get around the decision in Jones, to change the system as little as possible?
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="196.157" stopTime="215.618">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    No, Your Honor, because there is an immense difference between the top-two system and the system that replaces the old blanket nominating primary. 
    The immense difference is of course that the first stage of this two-stage general election process is no longer being used to select the nominees of the parties, which was identified as the one characteristic in Jones--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="215.618" stopTime="221.912">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Justice Alito can defend his own question, but he asked whether or not the Grange stated that this was the purpose.

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    --Well, the Grange was--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And then you... you didn't quite answer that question.

    But just as a matter of the historical record--
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="229.989" stopTime="230.925">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    --Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="230.925" stopTime="235.549">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Justice Alito's question was accurate with respect to the proponent's position, was it not?
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="235.549" stopTime="264.599">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, Your Honor, but the Grange also said in the voters' pamphlet statement, quote, 
    "This system has all the characteristics of a partisan blanket primary save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a primary's nominee. " 
    That's Joint Appendix 79. 
    So, yes, they were campaigning for it, but I believe that the relevant State purpose or regulatory interest in allowing an expression of party preference is the same as we see referenced in Tashjian and in Anderson v. Celebrezze.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="264.599" stopTime="278.155">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, if it's your position that the parties are not really injured or affected by this, and the parties' position is that they are, who should we believe? 
    I mean, it's hard for you to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their best interest.
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="278.155" stopTime="293.838">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Your Honor, this is a facial challenge. 
    All the major cases underlying this one were as-applied challenges. 
    The parties were able to bring in, in all those cases, evidence. 
    There is no evidence in the record that the parties will be harmed by the expression of party preference.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="293.838" stopTime="333.869">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We know what... what it's going to be like. 
    We don't know the exact phrasing on the ballot, but we do know that a candidate is allowed to associate himself with a party, but a party is not allowed to disociate itself from the candidate. 
    I am less concerned about the fact that the candidate can't say I'm the... I'm the no-taxes candidate, than I am about the fact that he can associate himself with the Republican Party or the Democratic Party on the ballot and that party has no opportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do with this person. 
    That it seems to me is a great disadvantage to the parties.
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="333.869" stopTime="351.813">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Justice Scalia, there may be an association in the dictionary sense, in the same way that a candidate who expressed a preference for one public policy versus another may be associated. 
    But in the constitutional sense, this Court has found that there is a forced association only when the objecting party is compelled to speak it or when the objecting party is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="351.813" stopTime="380.536">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not talking about a First Amendment forced association. 
    I'm talking about an association for purposes of making this a fair election at which the parties have an opportunity to nominate and support their own candidates. 
    And what this system creates is a ballot in which an individual can associate himself with the Republican Party, but on the ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate itself from that candidate.
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="380.536" stopTime="392.594">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    --Your Honor, I would refer the Justices to pages 2 and 3 of the Grange yellow brief where two sample ballots are laid out that incorporate the language from the declaration of candidacy regulations.

speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="419.490" stopTime="431.938">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    --Justice Ginsburg, these are two examples of what the ballot is likely to look like, although it's frankly also likely to have even more information stating the difference between expressing a preference and expressing a formal association.

    Let's assume the Democratic Party decides to have a State convention. 
    If the law in Washington provided that the nominee selected by that convention could state on the ballot not merely a preference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, your position in this case I take it would be exactly the same.

speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="535.023" stopTime="540.365">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, Your Honor, because they will be promulgated under regulations established by the State secretary of state.

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But in Washington State nearly all voters vote by mail now. 
    So they... over 90 percent of voters and eventually nearly 100 percent of voters will be voting by mail and will receive the same ballot form, with the same ballot instructions and explanations as in the samples that I've showed you.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="560.419" stopTime="585.409">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is... Iis there any, what should I say, truth investigation by the State of Washington? 
    Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat all his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees with all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses to state on the ballot: I prefer the Republican Party. 
    That's okay?

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I would refer you, Justice Scalia to JA-415. 
    Section 9.5(5) of Initiative 872 requires the candidate to sign a notarized declaration, quote, 
    "stating that the information provided on the form is true. " 
    So they are signing declarations... a declaration which is notarized saying that everything that they have put on the form is true.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="610.180" stopTime="613.226">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I guess... how can you say it's false?

    That's correct, Your Honor.

speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="619.099" stopTime="656.021">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, Justice Scalia, it is expression of preference. 
    It is a subjective expression. 
    It would be difficult to disprove. 
    However, if a candidate were to... let's say the chairman of the State Republican Party filed a declaration of candidacy and said, I prefer the Democratic Party. 
    The Democratic Party would have many opportunities to object. 
    And you know, the ballot is not even the most important source of information that voters have, as this Court has recognized in Tashjian and Celebrezze. 
    So there would be many opportunities. 
    If there is a concern about false statements, Your Honor, it seems to me the correct approach is to provide for more speech, not to limit the speech of all the candidates by refusing to permit them to express their preferences.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="656.021" stopTime="662.206">

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Justice Kennedy, the candidates will be expressing a preference, this is true if they wish to. 
    But there will be many... first of all, that is not compelled speech by the party; and secondly, it is not compelling the party to accept that person as a member, as a member. 
    As the emergency rules for the declaration and as a sample ballot show, we'll be very explicit in explaining to the voters that someone claiming a preference, it's not a statement by the party that they're claiming the person as a member or a formal association.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="715.386" stopTime="723.009">

    Mr. Dale would be exercising his own speech, but that would not be the same thing as compelling speech by the Boy Scouts.

    The reason is that we have to have time to print the ballots and produce the ballots in time to send out 3 weeks before the election, when over 90 percent of voters begin voting by mail.

    The first basis is that, as we've shown with the sample ballots from the Grange brief, the State will be extremely explicit in stating that the candidate's claim of preference or statement of preference is not the party's statement that the candidate is a member, endorsee, nominee, or what have you. 
    The second basis is I think just the general basis this Court has recognized in Tasjian and in Anderson v. Cellebreze, where the Court expressed a greater faith in the ability of individual voters to inform themselves beyond just the balance. 
    There are so many other sources of information.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't think it's enough that... that there's no claim of party endorsement. 
    There is a claim of associating himself with the party, and if he associates himself with the party it seems to me the party should be able to disassociate itself from him. 
    And I think it harms the party not to permit that.

    No, Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree.

    In Washington State over 40 percent of the voters, for example, identify themselves by... as independents. 
    Keeping in mind we have no party registration in Washington State, over 40 percent of voters when asked say I'm an independent; I may... and that does not mean they may not prefer one party over the other, they may not generally vote for one party or the other, but they think of themselves as independent.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    General McKenna, I'm interested in how this new system meshes with the otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election laws. 
    For example, the major political parties have a certain... certain benefits that are not given to minor parties, and the major parties are determined on the basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election. 
    How are you going to figure out whether the Republican Party has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican Party, although he's not really a Republican?
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="1248.737" stopTime="1282.021">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Your Honor, as legal counsel for the State we've analyzed that question, and have concluded that unless and until the legislature chooses to alter the statute to harmonize at a practical level, the way that we will apply that statute is to count the votes of the party cast for the party's official nominee. 
    The person who has been identified the party through their separate nominating process, for example, through a convention, that person will be identified. 
    And they will campaign as "the nominee". 
    They will explain that to the voters in every way possible, and we will count the votes cast for that person in calculating whether the 5 percent threshold has been met.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Well, the Initiative 872, Justice Kennedy, repealed the old State law which required the parties to use the State primary to select their nominees. 
    And Initiative 872, in fact, is silent on the procedures the parties will follow. 
    So they are left as they were back in the early days of statehood to decide for themselves how to designate their nominees.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1316.444" stopTime="1319.974">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And they have not devised a structure that we know of?
speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="1319.974" stopTime="1372.140">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    No. 
    Actually, Your Honor, they have. 
    In fact, the Republican Party after Initiative 872 was adopted and before it was enjoined adopted rules and procedures for holding nominating conventions. 
    And they also, for example, adopted a rule, which is Rule 5, that they said that if an incumbent runs and receives 66 percent of the support at the nominating convention, no other Republican can go onto the ballot. 
    This is their claim. 
    No other Republican can go onto the first stage ballot and claim to be a Republican. 
    That is their assertion. 
    Only that one person can go on with the "R" after his name... an idea that we basically reject if it means that no one else can even express a preference for the Republican Party. 
    But we agree that only one candidate will be allowed to truthfully claim that he or she is the nominee of the party if the party has gone through a nominating process of its own.

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    Yes, sir, Justice Scalia, they may. 
    I would just like to close this part of my argument, if I may, by pointing out that in our view the voters have adopted a top-two election system which vindicates both the rights of the parties and the people. 
    The parties can select their standardbearers without any State interference, adopting their own nomination process. 
    And the people are not limited to candidates selected by the parties. 
    They have more choice, which is a value that was validated in the Jones decision, albeit holding that you can't do that with nonmembers selecting the party's nominees. 
    The parties, though, argue that no candidate can even state an expression of party preference, cannot make an expression of party preference on the ballot without the party's consent. 
    Taken to its logical conclusion, the parties are really claiming they have a First Amendment right to require the State to place a single candidate of their choosing on the ballot.

    The notion that disclaimers are necessary, and the State indicates that they will spend a million dollars to try to clear this up, is evidence of the confusion that's likely to occur. 
    But even if the State does come forward and put all these disclaimers and preferences on, what the State is essentially doing on the ballot is masking who the Republican Party's nominee is by the presence of other candidates--

    Well, if you have the disclaimer, Your Honor, and the statements that this doesn't really mean anything, then you would come to the question of what legitimate State interest is being advanced by having someone put Republican on the ballot as their party preference, when it in fact means nothing; it does not mean they are associated with the party.

    You... you have identified... in the course of your argument, you've identified two separate problems with the... with the scheme as you see it. 
    One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity of an official nominee, and the other is that it in effect allows competition on the ballot by a person under the same party banner with the official nominee.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I... I... no, I understand that to be your position, but my question is, and I realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we... we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity of the candidate is the real flaw, then the... the hypothetical that was included in the... in Jones, in the dictum, of the... of the party that... of the ballot that has no party identification whatsoever, that would equally be bad, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_j_white_jr" startTime="2286.798" stopTime="2297.389">
    Mr. John J. White, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, because what it is, in this instance, Initiative 872 is a partisan primary that would mask the identity of the party nominee.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2297.389" stopTime="2309.088">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. John J. White, Jr.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But if... but if it's just masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're making the same argument that you make when you say, by allowing statements of preference, we obscure the character of the official nominee and in effect allow somebody to have a... a second shot at... at getting Republican support as a Republican. 
    It seems to me that if it's masking in a partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only one objection and the objection is not so much the masking as it is the submergence of the official nomination by allowing competition under the party's name by another candidate. 
    Isn't that fair to say?

    Mr. John J. White, Jr. 
    I... I think, Justice Souter, that it... that it is two separate inquiries. 
    First you have the difficulty that as a practical matter these candidates will be identified as Republican nominees or Republican candidates, but even if the State were able to posit sufficient disclaimers and caveats, that the State has shown no valid interest in allowing a candidate to use the name--

    I'm not... I'm not sure that it would, Your Honor. 
    I'm not sure that it would because... and what the State and the Grange argued below is that... they actually argued for severance because that would then convert Initiative 872 into a truly nonpartisan primary, but that's not what was on the ballot.

    I'm confused about the difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge. 
    On the one hand, it's very helpful to you. 
    There's no evidence out there that this has ever... this has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it right away, but then you have this relief that basically enjoins the whole... whole procedure.

    Mr. John J. White, Jr. 
    Well, the Court asked General McKenna a question during his argument about whether the problem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate capturing a party's name on the ballot. 
    It has not under Initiative 872 because it was enjoined before being effective.

    Yes, but it also seems highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know who the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be such confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of the other people who also put an R after their name. 
    The likelihood of massive confusion seems highly improbable to me. 
    I mean you... you have your own convention where you nominate the Republican nominee, your preferred candidate, and that's publicized generally throughout the State, and you're concerned that somebody going into the ballot box won't... won't understand what's been going on.

    I have noticed that the political parties have never objected to having their nominees listed on the ballot as... you know, as such.

    Mr. Chief Justice, this is an excellent opportunity to point out that the letter after the name, whether it's the letter as on page one of the Grange ballot or an expression of party preference on pages two and three, is not the only information on the ballot. 
    As we've shown in the samples, there will be lots of other information on the ballot which clearly distinguishes the expression of party preference.

    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    In the scenario or the ballot on page 1, Justice Stevens, I believe that what would happen is the Secretary of State would still provide the additional language. 
    If that additional language is not provided, if it were just that bare ballot with no explanatory language, then, yes, it would be much harder to defend as being constitutional. 
    But that, in fact, is not the way it's going to work.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2936.771" stopTime="2955.014">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But my point is there could never be a ballot just like this, what your opponents are talking about, because there are always going to be at least two or three R's and two or three D's.

speaker="robert_m_mckenna" startTime="2955.014" stopTime="2989.250">
    Mr. Robert M. McKenna 
    But the key here, Your Honor, is that even under the ballot on page one, what is not happening under top-two is that the nominee of the party is not being selected. 
    That's not happening any more. 
    And in Jones the Court said that the top-two is the same in all characteristics save one, which is the result of the nominee not being selected. 
    And that is exactly what is happening under top-two: The nominee is not being selected; and, as applied, we are going to be providing lots of other information on the ballot to make it very clear what the expression "party preference" means.
