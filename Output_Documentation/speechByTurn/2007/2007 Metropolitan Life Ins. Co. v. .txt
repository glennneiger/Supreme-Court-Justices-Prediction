    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    First case is Metropolitan Life Insurance v. Glenn and has to do with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which we all know as ERISA. 
    Now that Act allows a person who has -- has been denied health benefits or disability benefits, certain others under the employee benefit plan to challenge in federal court the denial. 
    In an earlier case called Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber, we held that trust law supplies the relevant standard of review when they bring their lawsuit. 
    Applying that law, we said that when a benefit plan gives the plan administrator discretion to make benefits decisions, a court should review the administrator's decision, I mean the decision denying health benefits say to a worker. 
    The Court should review it under an abusive discretion standard and we said that if the administrator is laboring under a conflict of interest, the conflict should be weighed as a factor but may conduct that abuse of discretion review. 
    Now in this case, MetLife an insurance company is both the administrator and the insurer of the Sears, Roebuck disability plan. 
    So, it evaluates a worker's claim, is it right or wrong and then if the claim is right, as insurer, it pays the claim. 
    The Sixth Circuit said that is a conflict of interest and it should be treated as a factor in deciding whether MetLife's decision and discretionary decisions in denying permanent disability benefits to the respondent Ms. Wanda Glenn takes that conflict of interest into account. 
    Now, we granted review to determine whether the Court of Appeals was right in finding that MetLife did have a conflict of interest and we also said if that's so we will consider how courts should account for such a conflict on judicial review. 
    Since that was the question, two questions and the answer that we've given is we first conclude in the administrator of a plan that both evaluates and pays the claim does have a conflict of interest of the kind that Firestone mentioned. 
    It's quite clear when the employer is administering and also evaluating the claim, paying the claim because then every dollar the employee says, "I won't pay" is the extra dollar he has in his own pocket. 
    So, that's a conflict. 
    The conclusions will be less clear when it's an insurance company that's performing that dual role because they do have a professional interest in fair claims evaluation, that's insurance companies are in the business of doing in part, but although these marketplace pressures provide a reason why a professional insurer might have a less serious conflict than an employer would, we still think that some kind of conflict exists. 
    So, turning to the question and of how a court should account for the conflict, we simply apply Firestone's teaching and it is just one factor among many. 
    We add Firestone means what it says and Firestone said it's a factor. 
    That's what it is, it's a factor. 
    When judges review, the lawfulness of a denial of benefits, they all account for many different considerations of which is one, that's just the third way of saying what I've already said twice. 
    The factor may be -- account for a lot more, where for example, the administrator is an insurance company with a history of biased claims proceeding. 
    On the other hand, that factor could account a lot -- for a lot less where the administrator has a history of setting up internal procedures and checks that try to minimize any financial incentive to deny claims. 
    So, that's the best we could do and we look at this case and say, "We think that the Sixth Circuit got it right. 
    "And they said the insurance company was wrong and should have paid the money to Ms. Glenn and we agree with her about that and they applied the proper standard then we affirm the Court's decision. 
    So we have an example here of what we think went right. 
    The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined or at least that's fairly --
