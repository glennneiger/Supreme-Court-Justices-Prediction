    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    A basic tenet of our system of justice is that anyone who states a claim on which relief can be granted is entitled to his or her own day in court. 
    Therefore, a judgment in a lawsuit generally does not bind the person without a party to the suit. 
    The question presented in this case, is there a virtual representation exception to this general rule. 
    Petitioner Brent Taylor filed suit under the freedom of Information Act, seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
    Greg Herrick(ph) Taylor's friend had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records. 
    The two men have no formal legal relationship and there was no evidence that Taylor controlled finance, participated in or even knew about Herrick's earlier suit. 
    Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found that Taylor's suit was precluded by the judgment against Herrick. 
    In the Court of Appeals' view, Herrick had virtually represented Taylor in the prior adjudications. 
    Under the multifactor test announced by the D.C. Circuit, Herrick qualified as Taylor's virtual representative because Herrick's incentive to litigate was at least as strong as Taylor's. 
    The two men sought release of the same documents were close associates and hired the same lawyer. 
    We disapproved the doctrine of preclusion by a virtual representation. 
    And therefore, vacate the D.C. Circuit's judgment. 
    As our decision is confirmed, there are several exceptions to the rule against non-party preclusion. 
    But the doctrine of virtual representation adopted by the D.C. Circuit is broader and cloudier than any of the exceptions we have approved. 
    Our opinion explains why we find the doctrine an unwarranted departure from the general rule that every person is entitled to his or her own day in court. 
    It was a result reached by the D.C. Circuit nevertheless justifiable under one of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion. 
    Most of those grounds have no application here, but one might cover this case. 
    Preclusion would be appropriate if Taylor, in pursuing his own suit, is acting not independently, but as Herrick's agent. 
    We remand to give the courts below an opportunity to address that yet unresolved issue. 
    The Court's opinion is unanimous.
