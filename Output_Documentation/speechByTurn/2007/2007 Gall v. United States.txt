    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Justice Stevens has the opinion for the Court today in case Number 06-7949, Gall versus United States, which he has asked me to announce. 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    Petitioner Gall pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. 
    He had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy and ceased using drugs some three years prior to his indictment. 
    After a full sentencing hearing, the District Judge decided to sentence petitioner to probation for a term of 36 months instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment within the 30 to 37 month range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing because it concluded that petitioner's sentence was not supported by a justification that was proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence that was imposed. 
    We granted certiorari and now reversed for reasons stated in a 21-page opinion. 
    We hold that while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant. 
    Courts of Appeals must review all sentences whether inside or outside the Guidelines range under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. 
    We also hold that the sentence imposed by the District Judge in this case was reasonable. 
    Justice Scalia and Justice Souter have filed separate concurring opinions. 
    Justice Thomas and Justice Alito have filed separate dissenting opinions.
