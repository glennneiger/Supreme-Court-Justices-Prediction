    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    These consolidated cases come to us on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit. 
    Like most cases involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), they are very complicated. 
    They concern the interaction between an old administrative law doctrine and a new regulatory regime. 
    The old administrative law doctrine is called the Mobile-Sierra doctrine. 
    Under the Federal Power Act, companies that sell electricity at wholesale to purchasers such as state and local public utilities, must file a tariff with the -- with FERC, setting out the rates that they will charge to buyers, generally. 
    And the Commission determines whether those rates are, to use the statutory term, “just and reasonable”. 
    Traditionally, in reviewing these rates, FERC ensured that wholesalers receive a fair rate of return on their investment, but no more. 
    Aside from tariffs, the Federal Power Act also permits wholesalers to set rates with individual purchasers through bilateral contracts. 
    So, a wholesaler and a purchasing public utility may agree by contract to a rate different from what the wholesaler charges other purchasers under its tariff, and can lock that rate in for a period of time. 
    Those contracts must be filed with FERC before they go into effect. 
    Under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the name comes from two of the cases in this Court in 1956, under that doctrine, FERC must presume that these rates set by freely negotiated contracts between sophisticated wholesalers and public utilities, are just and reasonable. 
    The premise being, that these sophisticated parties can be expected to negotiate a just and reasonable rate. 
    Only where the rate seriously harms the public interest, may FERC and must FERC, set it aside. 
    So, that's the old administrative law doctrine. 
    The new regulatory regime is a recent FERC innovation called market-based tariffs. 
    A market-based tariff does not set out rates like traditional tariffs. 
    Rather, it allows the seller to enter into freely negotiated contracts with buyers in the energy market. 
    To qualify for a market-based tariff, a seller of electricity, a wholesaler, must show that it does not have excessive market power. 
    The key aspect of the market-based tariff, for purposes of this case, is that the contracts entered into under them do not have to be filed with FERC before they go into effect. 
    Instead, the wholesaler periodically reports to FERC after the fact, all contracts that it entered into. 
    FERC believes that the Federal Power Act's requirement that all rates be filed first with the Commission is satisfied by the filing of the market-based tariff itself. 
    In these cases, respondents are Western Utilities that entered into long-term contracts with petitioner wholesalers that had market-based tariffs on file with FERC. 
    The contracts set rates that were very high, by historical standards, because at the time, short-term prices in the Western United States had spiked to very high levels due to a variety of economic, natural and regulatory factors. 
    After that period of high prices had passed, the respondents here, having buyers' remorse, asked FERC to modify the contracts. 
    But FERC refused after determining under Mobile-Sierra that the public interest was not seriously harmed. 
    Respondents petitioned to the Ninth Circuit which granted the petitions for review and remanded to FERC on two alternative grounds. 
    First, the Ninth Circuit thought that because contracts entered into under market-based tariffs are never initially filed with the Commission, they are not entitled to the Mobile-Sierra presumption of validity, a presumption that their rates are just and reasonable. 
    In other words, the Ninth Circuit thought that the Mobile-Sierra presumption does not apply to FERC's first review of a contract. 
    Second, the Ninth Circuit held that even if the Mobile-Sierra presumption did apply, the standard for a challenge by a purchaser, the utilities here, is lower than the standard for a seller's challenge, namely, for the buyer, the standard is merely whether the contract causes consumer rates to exceed a zone of reasonableness. 
    So far are you with me, right? [Laughter] 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong on both counts, but that FERC committed other errors in applying the Mobile-Sierra doctrine. 
    We, therefore, affirm the decision below on alternative grounds. 
    Why was the Ninth Circuit wrong? 
    First, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not apply only where FERC has had an initial opportunity to review the contract without the presumption. 
    Rather, it defines how the statutory just and reasonable standard applies in the contract -- in the context of contracts, no matter when they are challenged. 
    Second, the standard for a purchase whose challenge is the same generally speaking is the standard for a seller's challenge. 
    The contract to be invalidated must seriously harm the public interest. 
    Over the last 50 years, this Court, lower courts and the Commission have understood the standard to be a high one. 
    We have described it for instance as, “unequivocal public necessity”. 
    FERC, thus, was correct both to apply the Mobile-Sierra standard and to treat the standard as a high one. 
    Nevertheless, we find two defects in FERC's analysis. 
    First, it is unclear whether FERC examined the impact of the contracts on the consuming public, in light of the rates consumers could have obtained, today, in the absence of the contracts. 
    It seems that FERC may have simply looked to whether the contracts increased consumer rates immediately upon going into effect at the time when all of the prices were spiked. 
    Second, respondents allege that the petitioners engaged in unlawful market manipulation in the spot market that affected the long-term contracts at issue here. 
    FERC dismissed this allegation as irrelevant because the contract rates were not so high as to violate the public interest, but we conclude that if a party engaged in unlawful market activity that had an impact on the contract, the contract is not entitled to Mobile-Sierra presumption because it cannot be said to be the product of arm's length negotiations. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter has joined. 
    Neither -- neither the Chief Justice nor Justice Breyer took any part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
