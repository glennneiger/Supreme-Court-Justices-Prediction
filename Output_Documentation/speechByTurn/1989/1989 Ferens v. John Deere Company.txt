    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The sole issue presented by this case is whether a federal district court sitting in diversity to which a case has been transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1404 is required to apply the law that would have been applied had there been no transfer, where the transfer is from a court having proper jurisdiction, having proper venue, but the motion to transfer was made by a plaintiff. 
    The present proceedings were initiated by the Petitioners, residents of Pennsylvania, when the exercised their venue privilege by filing a timely complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, asserting claims for negligence and product liability against Respondent John Deere, arising out of Petitioner Albert Ferens' loss of his hand while cleaning his combine manufactured by the Respondent.

    The purpose of that filing was to get the benefit of the Mississippi statute of limitations?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="84.849" stopTime="102.722">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    There is no question about that, Your Honor. 
    The purpose of the filing in an appropriate forum was to gain the advantage of the Mississippi statute of limitations. 
    The Respondents did not oppose either the venue or the assertion of in personam jurisdiction over them in the Southern District of Mississippi.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, how could they?

    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    On the contrary--

    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --There was no basis to do so, Your Honor. 
    In fact, what they did in the case was file an answer in which they admitted specific facts that established the venue in the jurisdiction. 
    They were registered to do business in Mississippi, they maintained a registered agent there, and they were in fact doing business in Mississippi. 
    It is clear, therefore, that venue and jurisdiction were appropriate in the Southern District of Mississippi.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="130.250" stopTime="138.227">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Tucker, could the court sitting in Mississippi have declined to grant or allow the transfer?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="138.227" stopTime="217.329">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    It certainly could have, Your Honor. 
    And I think that is one of the important things that we want to stress for this Court. 
    It is not our argument in this case that a plaintiff filing a motion under Section 1404 has an absolute right to a transfer. 
    That is clearly not our position. 
    We may have a right to file a motion, but the determination of whether or not that case is going to be transferred is to be made by the district court after weighing all of the various factors that are appropriate for consideration under Section 1404. 
    In fact, in this very case, had the Respondents filed some objection to the motion to transfer, it is conceivable that the court in Mississippi would have denied the motion. 
    Had that happened, we would have had a forum in which to try this case, because the Mississippi forum was clearly appropriate. 
    Instead, by asserting the statute of limitations of Pennsylvania after the transfer had occurred, the Respondents have essentially engaged in the practice of using the transfer to defeat the state law advantages accruing to the Plaintiff from its initial selection of the forum, and Van Dusen proscribes that kind of conduct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="217.329" stopTime="227.167">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The holding of Van Dusen I don't believe is inconsistent with the result reached by the Third Circuit here. 
    Are you, you are saying some of the language is--
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="227.167" stopTime="368.020">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    I am saying the reasoning in Van Dusen, Your Honor. 
    I am not... it is not our position that Van Dusen held that, in this particular case, the law of Mississippi had to continue to apply. 
    In fact, the court specifically reserved judgment on that issue. 
    We are not claiming otherwise. 
    But it is our belief that the reasoning in Van Dusen is equally applicable in the present case, and that therefore the law of Mississippi should have continued to apply. 
    Now, the venue privilege that is accorded to a plaintiff is well established in the law. 
    The Judicial Code of 1948 established venue rights for plaintiffs seeking to bring suits in federal court. 
    Section 1391(c) of the Judicial Code... of that provision, provides broad latitude to plaintiffs seeking to bring suits against defendant corporations. 
    Not only is venue appropriate in a district where all the plaintiffs reside, or in the district where the cause of action arose, but venue is also appropriate with respect to corporations in the district where the corporation was incorporated, in any district in which it is licensed to do business, and in any district in which it is in fact doing business. 
    Implicit in the provision of broad venue rights to a plaintiff is the recognition that a plaintiff can select law in one of those forms that is more favorable than his selection of another form in the applicable law. 
    In Van Dusen this Court recognized the propriety of the exercise of the venue privilege and of the accrual of state law advantages that arose because of such a selection. 
    Indeed, this Court specifically deemed those rights worthy of protection against defendants who sought to use Section 1404 to defeat those rights. 
    Now, there is nothing about Section 1404 that indicates that it is any way intended to defeat plaintiff's venue privilege and the accrual of advantageous state law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="368.020" stopTime="381.848">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Your case would have more, perhaps, gut appeal to it if you had kept your so-called venue privilege in Mississippi and not transferred it back to Pittsburgh, where the action... or accident occurred.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="381.848" stopTime="447.283">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting though is that the applicable law selection is a result of the initial selection of an appropriate venue forum. 
    That's implicit by the way that Section 1391 is phrased. 
    Section 1404, which provides for transfers, is not an automatic right. 
    It does not provide a plaintiff or a defendant with a right to select a different forum and a different set of laws that will be applicable to the case. 
    The law that should be applied in the case is that which is applied as a result of the initial selection of the forum. 
    That is what the venue privilege establishes, that we have a right to do so. 
    And nothing in 1404 defeats that right. 
    1404, if you view the specific express language, contains nothing indicating that a transfer of venue should result in a transfer of the applicable law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="447.283" stopTime="454.856">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is it... is it perfectly clear under 1404 that it is available to plaintiffs on the same terms it is... as it is to defendants?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="454.856" stopTime="478.165">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    It's... it does not specifically say this statute is available to plaintiffs, but it talks it for the convenience of parties, it does not limit it to availability of defendants. 
    And in fact, I think the vast majority of cases that have addressed that issue have said that it clearly is something that is available to plaintiffs as well as to defendants. 
    I don't really think that there is any question about its availability.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="478.165" stopTime="481.955">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And on the same terms substantially as is to defendants?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="481.955" stopTime="540.422">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    There is nothing in the language indicating that its availability is on different terms. 
    I know that there is an amicus curiae brief that suggested that the factors that might be considered in determining whether or not to grant a motion made by a plaintiff are different than those which might be considered in a defendant-initiated motion, but that issue really isn't before the Court, because in this case the motion was made and the Respondent did not oppose it. 
    Section 1404's enunciated policy is to provide for the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice. 
    There is nothing in that enunciated policy that indicates that it was intended to defeat a plaintiff's venue privilege. 
    Finally, in what meager legislative history there is that deals with Section 1404, there is nothing to suggest that it was intended to defeat a plaintiff's venue privilege. 
    Consequently--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="540.422" stopTime="574.646">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Once the rule is adopted it wouldn't defeat the venue privilege, would it? 
    I mean, the plaintiff would simply know that if... that going in he was going to have to make a choice between getting the law of the place where he brought the suit or getting the more convenient forum. 
    I mean, it wouldn't be defeating anything... maybe in this one case it would, but once we announce what the rule is, the plaintiff's expectations will be very clear. 
    He can either pick the law and live with it in that forum, or he can pick the more convenient forum and get the law with it.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="574.646" stopTime="624.178">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --But I am not sure that you and I are disagreeing, Justice Scalia. 
    I am suggesting a rule that says that the plaintiff pick the forum initially, and that is his law. 
    He then has a right to ask the district court, considering factors of convenience and considering convenience of the witnesses, factors of fairness, to transfer that case. 
    But that transfer, under Section 1404, is to have no effect on the applicable law. 
    That's the rule that we are suggesting the Court adopt in this case, that it be a uniform rule, applicable regardless of whether it is the plaintiff or the defendant that is seeking to use 1404 to move the case from one court to another court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="624.178" stopTime="648.415">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that may be a sensible enough rule, but all I am suggesting is that it doesn't seem to me to be an accurate description to say we are taking away, or we would be taking away, the plaintiff's, the plaintiff's venue selection right if we held that if, on his initiative, he wants to trade that for a more convenient forum, he has to trade the law along with it.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="648.415" stopTime="649.126">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    Well, what I--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="649.126" stopTime="650.776">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It doesn't seem to me an unreasonable rule.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="650.776" stopTime="686.530">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --I think what we are talking about, Your Honor, is not necessarily simply the right to select the venue, because obviously by transferring a case you are changing the venue. 
    But what we are talking about is what the court talked about in Van Dusen, and that's the state law advantages that accrue as the result of the selection of a particular forum. 
    And in Van Dusen the court indicated that there was nothing about Section 1404 which indicated that it should be used, or could be used, to defeat those state law advantages.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="686.530" stopTime="721.943">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But there it was a defeat. 
    There you couldn't have said well, the plaintiff was just put to a trade. 
    He was given the option of you stick with your choice of law with the venue, or you can get a more convenient forum but you will have to give up the choice of law. 
    He didn't have that choice, because it was the defendant in that case who was trying to do him out of his selection of law. 
    He was perfectly happy to litigate there, and the defendant was depriving him of it. 
    All that your opponent is proposing here is that your client be put to his choice: pick your law or pick the convenient forum, but don't try to have both. 
    Isn't that--
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="721.943" stopTime="767.701">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    I understand that, Your Honor, but I am suggesting that in Van Dusen the Court's consideration of 1404 led it to conclude that essentially 1404 has nothing to do with the applicable law following a transfer. 
    This Court concluded in Van Dusen that 1404 was nothing other than a judicial housekeeping measure, that all it dealt with was the location of litigation, and all it did was authorize a transfer from one court room to another court room, that it should have no effect whatsoever on the applicable law following that transfer.

    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    Oh, I don't think... Van Dusen does not specifically apply to this case, because the Court reserved judgment on that question. 
    But I don't think any implication can be drawn from the fact that judgment was reserved on the issue that is before the Court now, as to whether the Court would have decided that issue one way or the other. 
    The fact of the matter is the issue simply was not before the Court in Van Dusen.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="819.448" stopTime="822.950">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you at least... the Court at least said it wasn't deciding the question.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="822.950" stopTime="828.324">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    That is correct. 
    It said it was not deciding the question. 
    All I am suggesting is that the reasoning--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="828.324" stopTime="838.512">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We usually don't reserve questions that are foregone conclusions from the reasoning.
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="838.512" stopTime="884.374">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --But this Court generally, I don't think, decides issues that aren't before it. 
    And in the case of Van Dusen what was before the Court was a defendant-initiated transfer, not a plaintiff-initiated transfer, and there was therefore no reason for the Court to decide one way or the other. 
    Just like in the present case, the issue is not before the Court as to what happens where the plaintiff has selected an improper initial forum. 
    That issue is not before the Court. 
    It is not our position, and we are not arguing here today that if the plaintiff selects an improper initial forum, either because of venue or jurisdictional grounds, that he still is entitled to the applicable law of the transferor state. 
    And I would submit that--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="884.374" stopTime="888.755">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean the law... you mean the law that the transferor state would have applied?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="888.755" stopTime="951.035">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --The law that the transferor state would have applied, yes, Your Honor. 
    And I think any opinion coming out of the Court today will reserve judgment on that issue because it is not before the Court. 
    Just as the plaintiff-initiated transfer question was not before the Court in Van Dusen. 
    I think there is nothing about a plaintiff-initiated transfer which compels any different result than that of a defendant-initiated transfer. 
    If you look at the express language in Section 1404 there is nothing that suggests that its use by a plaintiff somehow turns it into a devise to defeat the plaintiff's state law advantages accruing from the exercise, or the proper exercise, of its venue privilege. 
    There is nothing in the enunciated policy that suggests that, or in the legislative history that suggests that anything about a plaintiff's use of the section makes it different than a defendant's use. 
    In fact--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="951.035" stopTime="962.645">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Does Van Dusen stand for the principle that there is simply no connection between the convenience of the forum and the applicable law?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="962.645" stopTime="969.528">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --That would be our contention, Your Honor. 
    If 1404 deals only--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I think it can be read that way.

speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="977.293" stopTime="1008.985">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    --Well, 1404 deals only with consideration of convenience and fairness, not with considerations of the applicable law. 
    That's a result of this Court's determination in Van Dusen that it is just a judicial housekeeping measure. 
    In fact, this Court only last year described Section 1404 in the very same way in the Stewart Organization case. 
    Both the majority and the dissenting opinions in those cases described 1404 as a mere judicial housekeeping measure.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yet there is something odd about this case. 
    You end up trying it in Pennsylvania, in the district court in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania would have said there is a two-year statute of limitations. 
    Why should you be able to avoid that result by going down to Mississippi, where apparently nobody intended to try the case, and filing down there?
speaker="richard_b_tucker_iii" startTime="1027.607" stopTime="1052.513">
    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    That is absolutely incorrect, Your Honor. 
    If the motion... see, one of the problems with this case is that the Respondents did not oppose the motion. 
    Therefore, everybody assumes that we automatically had a right to come back to Pennsylvania, or that, if they had opposed the motion successfully, we would have abandoned the suit in Mississippi.

    We were not guaranteed that we would be able to come back to Pennsylvania however. 
    Our first choice, and our duty as counsel for the Petitioners in this case, was to file the case in an appropriate and proper forum. 
    And we did that. 
    Then, because it would be more convenient for them, we filed a motion seeking to make the case more conveniently tried by bringing it back to Pennsylvania. 
    We never contended that we had an absolute right to bring it back to Pennsylvania.

    It suggests also that, because it is the plaintiff that has made the original choice, that the plaintiff's initial selection should generally govern, unless the plaintiff can show, by a preponderance of evidence or arguments, that the case should be transferred.

    Now, technically it could have been brought and then dismissed on statute of limitations grounds, but there is a pretty good argument that it could not have been maintained in the district in Pennsylvania.

    I think that issue, Your Honor, has been resolved in the Van Dusen case, because one of the questions there was what it means... what that particular phraseology means, where it might have been brought. 
    And if I recall correctly, the Court in Van Dusen says that all that means is a jurisdiction or venue and... a forum where jurisdiction and venue are appropriate, even if it may have resulted in less favorable law. 
    I don't think that there was any basis for denying a transfer to Pennsylvania--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1225.017" stopTime="1255.217">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but it surely expresses the suggestion from Congress that one of the things that the transferring judge should consider is whether or not the litigation could have gone forward in that case... in that state. 
    And I would think the question, the questions presented by this particular certiorari petition is quite different from the question whether there might be a basis for refusing a transfer. 
    This judge might say well, you picked this forum, I am going to hold you to your choice.

   Argument of David P. Helwig
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1743.167" stopTime="1791.870">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The facts upon which Petitioners' claim is based have everything to do with Pennsylvania and nothing to do with Mississippi. 
    The only reason why any court would have ever even considered that Mississippi's statute of limitations should apply was that Petitioners apparently intended to litigate their action there. 
    By moving to transfer the action to Pennsylvania, Petitioners have abandoned Mississippi as a forum for choice of law purposes, and by so doing have eliminated the only reason which ever existed for applying Mississippi statute of limitations.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1791.870" stopTime="1795.163">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, you say they have abandoned them because that is the issue we have to decide, isn't it?
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1795.163" stopTime="1839.913">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Well, I think that is the issue that has to be decided, but the reason I make that point is I think the threshold inquiry is to ask why as a choice of law matter does a court select one statute of limitations or one choice of law rule over another choice of law rule. 
    With regard to statutes of limitation, it's simply the general rule, or the basic principle to which both Pennsylvania and Mississippi subscribe, is that they will apply their own statute of limitations, or their own choice of law rules selecting statutes of limitation, in a case which is pending in that forum.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1839.913" stopTime="1849.480">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, of course, if it is pending in a state court it would have been filed in the state court, too. 
    This is a peculiarly federal problem. 
    It only arises because federal courts sit in both jurisdictions.
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1849.480" stopTime="1860.136">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Right. 
    And guarantee trust requires that the district court apply whatever statute of limitations that the state court in the state in which it was sitting would have applied.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1860.136" stopTime="1866.810">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, it's a principle that states may select the law which should apply, is it not?
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1866.810" stopTime="1869.331">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Absolutely, and that is what the court held in Wortman.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1869.331" stopTime="1884.750">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And then you have to show, I suppose, that there, in order to prevail, that there is some policy implicit in 1404 that overrides that state choice, whimsical as it may be in some instances.
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1884.750" stopTime="1947.340">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    I am not suggesting that there... and in fact the court has held by its earlier grant of certiorari in vacating the Third Circuit's prior judgment, that Mississippi's choice of law rule is not to be overthrown. 
    And that is not what we are arguing about. 
    But in Wortman, the point isn't... I think the crucial point in Wortman is yes, the states are free to apply whatever choice of law rules they choose to with regard to statute of limitations. 
    But, on the other hand, it doesn't mean... the court held that you don't federalize the choice of law rules. 
    You limit the application to a particular state, neither due process nor full faith and credit require the federal courts to invalidate a given state's choice of law rule. 
    And here the rule we are really concerned with is Pennsylvania's choice of law rule, because for all practical purposes that is where Petitioners have chosen to litigate their claim, not Mississippi.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1947.340" stopTime="1952.644">

speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1952.644" stopTime="1954.366">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Absolutely, Van Dusen would--

    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    --I believe that, in light of Van Dusen and in light of the applicable choice of law rules, that you would apply the transferor forum's choice of law rules, because the original forum is still--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1976.430" stopTime="1977.141">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What if the plaintiff--
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="1977.141" stopTime="1982.383">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    --the forum which the plaintiff had selected in which to litigate their claim.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1982.383" stopTime="2011.004">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --So in that case you would treat that like a defendant-initiated transfer. 
    What if the plaintiff went up to the judge after... say you win this case, the plaintiff went... the plaintiff's lawyer to the judge and said judge, I can't make a motion because if I do the case will be dismissed when it is transferred, but I think you should know that most of the witnesses live in Pennsylvania and it just makes a lot more sense to have the case tried up there. 
    Maybe you'll want to ask the defendant what their views are on a transfer. 
    Would that... would that cause it to be a plaintiff-initiated transfer if he didn't actually make a formal motion?
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="2011.004" stopTime="2025.123">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    I... that raises a problem of getting into subjective intent of the plaintiff, and I don't think... I think you really have to look to what happens on the record.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2025.123" stopTime="2050.719">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, you would limit it to the case where the judge calls the parties in and says hey, this looks kind of silly, we're trying a case in Mississippi when all the witnesses and the parties are in Pennsylvania. 
    Does anybody object if I transfer the case? 
    I have had that happen in trials. 
    And you would say that would be treated like a defendant-initiated transfer? 
    And if you do say that, why should there be a different rule if the plaintiff calls the same considerations to the attention of the court?

    Well--

    Mr. David P. Helwig

    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    Well, if it is a joint motion I think, again, that the plaintiff has eliminated the reason for applying the original forum's statute of limitations, namely the selection of that forum as the one in which to go forward with the litigation. 
    So I think wherever the plaintiff abandons that forum, you eliminate the basic choice of law principle that would support application of that forum's statute of limitations.

    If you file it in Mississippi you are going to have to try it in Mississippi.

    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    --Well, I believe that it hasn't reached this Court. 
    I think in the Schreiber v. Allis-Chalmers case that the, I think it was the Tenth Circuit, validated the constitutionality. 
    The Third Circuit questioned the constitutionality of the Mississippi statute of limitations across the board, but of course this Court reversed that particular judgment by the Third Circuit. 
    Also, Justice Kennedy, you asked about did the... did a change in law have any... anything to do with convenience. 
    And I think Petitioners' counsel said it should not. 
    But in fact in Van Dusen I think the Court expressly addressed that question, because in Van Dusen, in ruling on the transfer motion, the district court said it should make no difference whatsoever whether you have... a change in the applicable law. 
    And I think that this Court expressly stated that that was an incorrect mode of analysis, so I wanted to address that point. 
    There was a lot of talk on discussion in Petitioners' argument about the notion that Section 1404(a) has been described as a judicial housekeeping measure, and I have the sense that Petitioner was attempting to substitute labeling for analysis. 
    Now, this Court long ago in the context of the Erie jurisprudence rejected labeling as a matter of determining the way a particular case should be resolved. 
    That is, labeling as substantive or labeling as procedural can't take the place of analysis. 
    Certainly it is a judicial housekeeping measure, and in this Court Van Dusen... in Van Dusen this Court held that it is a judicial housekeeping measure that wasn't intended to destroy state choice of law advantages. 
    But equally, it is a judicial housekeeping measure that wasn't intended to enlarge those state choice of law advantages and affect federal law--

    Well, how does this enlarge them? 
    I don't understand that. 
    If the case is properly filed in Mississippi, and you apply Mississippi rules which pick up all of Pennsylvania law except the statute of limitations, how does the transfer change that? 
    How does that enlarge the Plaintiffs' legal claim?

    But that is the peculiarity in the case. 
    But once you say they have gotten into Mississippi properly, how can you say they have enlarged the rights they have in Mississippi by transferring to Pennsylvania, which is a more convenient place to try the lawsuit?

    Your Honor, I think there are certainly arguments that can be made that Van Dusen was incorrectly decided.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but it needs to hold that to buy the argument that you just made. 
    I mean, it seems to me we have crossed that bridge, that this thing tracks forum nonconvenience. 
    We... we've crossed that bridge when we decided Van Dusen the way we did. 
    Because we decided in Van Dusen that it does not produce the result that forum nonconvenience dismissal would produce.
speaker="david_p_helwig" startTime="2691.130" stopTime="2794.508">
    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    --That... that has been decided, and I am not taking a position that Van Dusen should be overruled. 
    It does... I was in the course of just attempting to respond to Justice Stevens' question. 
    But I want to make abundantly clear that it is not our position that Van Dusen needs to be overruled. 
    The Third Circuit, I believe, relied on Van Dusen in rendering a judgment in favor of John Deere Company in this case. 
    I... if you read their opinion, they said it was Petitioners' interpretation of Section 1404(a) that was inconsistent with Van Dusen. 
    The Court had good reason in Van Dusen for reserving the question of what the effect would be of a plaintiff-initiated transfer. 
    It wasn't just dealt with by ignoring the issue. 
    The Court went out and said there may be other considerations in the case of a plaintiff-initiated transfer. 
    And I think those other considerations are readily apparent by the fact... become readily apparent under the facts of this case. 
    And I think Van Dusen's mode of analysis as far as statutory construction actually, again, supports the Third Circuit's judgment in favor of Respondent in this case. 
    That mode of analysis being in the absence of a discernible legislative intent or congressional intent to change law we are going to maintain the status quo. 
    It is a hands-off approach, but it should be a hands-off approach no matter who seeks the transfer. 
    And the hands-off approach in the case of a defendant-initiated transfer leaves one with the application of Pennsylvania's law.

    Just as I think you would be obligated to advise someone who, some other procedural... some other choice of law rule that the forum considers to be procedural, advise that person, hey, maybe you should go to a state where the burden of proof is different or the rule on presumption is different. 
    I think that professional duty extends to counsel with respect to all these legal rules that many forums consider to be procedural for choice of law purposes, but which Erie requires their application because they so affect the outcome of the case. 
    And I... that raises, or that gets into the possibility that I have raised. 
    That if Petitioners' interpretation of Section 1404(a) is adopted, the... it's an inducement to plaintiffs to attempt to capture this wide variety of choice of law rules that are considered to be procedural. 
    It is not just a statute of limitations situation, that presumptions, burden of proof, burden of production, sufficiency of evidence and statute of frauds are all considered by many forums to be procedural.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but in all except the statute of limitations situation there is no deterrent to just filing in the forum you want to stand up in.

    Mr. David P. Helwig

    Yeah. 
    Well, but Mr. Helwig, here is what troubles me. 
    I don't see any basis in the text of the statute or anything else for saying that you... federal court has to apply one law where the plaintiff moves, another law where the defendant moves. 
    I mean, we would be making that up. 
    There is just no basis in there for that. 
    There is a basis in the statute, however, for meeting the problem that you are concerned about in a different fashion. 
    That is, for simply saying if somebody has filed in a forum that is an inconvenient forum, and if the affect of transferring it is to send it to... at his instance, is to... at his instance is to send it to a forum where he would not have been able to win had he sued there, the court should not allow the transfer. 
    You have language that permits that here, it says in the interest of justice a district court may transfer. 
    In other words, the decision whether to transfer or not to transfer is very much at the discretion of the court, by... the text of the statute. 
    And I feel sort of free to follow my gut feeling which, frankly, is somewhat like yours, that this seems like a, you know, a legally permissible thing, but not the kind of thing we ought to encourage. 
    So why... why shouldn't I do it that way rather than by saying yes, you can transfer, but the... but the law that applies is the law of the transferee forum.

    Mr. David P. Helwig

    Mr. David P. Helwig 
    I think that the alternative view, as a matter of common sense, would also create a desirable prophylactic rule to discourage these kinds of filings, which I really think do constitute the sort of impermissible forum shopping that both Van Dusen and Erie are concerned with. 
    As a pro... but as a matter of common sense, I agree with you, that also would be a desirable prophylactic rule. 
    I do have some question, however, whether there really is a basis in the statute for treating plaintiff-initiated transfers differently from defendant-initiated transfers as far as the standards to be applied. 
    I am not sure that I see that there, although as a common sense way of dealing with the question, I think it has much to commend it.

I am not saying that the question of choice of law couldn't be taken into consideration under that heading, but I don't think it's going to be entitled to dispositive weight because you do have these other factors which, as in this particular case, everything about the case is back in Pennsylvania. 
    So, it wouldn't... the interest of justice approach wouldn't necessarily compel the district court to deny the transfer motion. 
    I really, unless there are no further questions, I respectfully request the Court to affirm the Third Circuit's judgment in favor of John Deere Company.

   Rebuttal of Richard B. Tucker, III

    Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    There are just three points that I would like to touch on very briefly. 
    Justice Scalia's interest of justice analysis, I think, results in this case in the requirement that the Third Circuit's decision be reversed and this case be remanded to the Western District of Pennsylvania for trial. 
    And if the Court adopts the position, or at least the suggestion, that Justice Scalia has indicated from his questioning, I think that that is the appropriate outcome in this particular case. 
    I wanted to address something that Justice Stevens was talking about, asking in terms of what enlargement of rights is there from the transfer of the case from the Southern District of Mississippi back to the Western District of Pennsylvania. 
    As Your Honor pointed out, there is no enlargement of rights. 
    There is only one benefit to the Plaintiff in this particular case; it is more convenient. 
    And lo and behold, you look at Section 1404 and what does it say, for the convenience of the parties. 
    The transfer of the case was for the express purposes set forth in the statute. 
    If you listen to the arguments that are being made by the Respondents, they are all in favor of discouraging plaintiffs from utilizing forums which would be properly available for them under the venue statutes set forth in the judicial code. 
    How are they going to discourage that? 
    They are going to discourage it by making it inconvenient and expensive for plaintiffs to try cases in those forums. 
    Again, I submit that any argument that fosters an application of Section 1404 against the convenience is--
