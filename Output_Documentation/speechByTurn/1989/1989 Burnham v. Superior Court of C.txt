    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 89-44, Dennis Burnham v. The Superior Court of California. 
    Mr. Sherman.
speaker="richard_sherman" startTime="25.948" stopTime="214.705">
    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue presented here is whether a state can exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who was personally served while present in the state if that defendant does not otherwise have sufficient contacts with the state to satisfy the minimum contacts test announced in International Shoe. 
    The issue arises in the following context. 
    The parties lived virtually all their married lives in New Jersey. 
    The split up in 1987. 
    They had two children about ages 2 and 8 at the time, and they entered into a marital settlement agreement resolving everything in New Jersey. 
    The wife then moved to California with the children, as planned, and husband filed for dissolution in New Jersey and asked the court to incorporate their marital settlement agreement. 
    Before he served Mrs. Burnham with his petition, she filed an action in California for legal separation and filed him after he brought the children back from visiting with them to her home in Mill Valley, California. 
    Mr. Burnham moved to quash service arguing that he did not have sufficient minimum contacts under Kulko, International Shoe and similar cases and that under this Court's decision in Shaffer v. Heitner the fact that he was served in California was no longer relevant at all. 
    The trial court initially agreed with Mr. Burnham and granted his motion, in part holding that there were not sufficient minimum contacts and there was no personal jurisdiction. 
    It reconsidered that order when Mrs. Burnham's attorney convinced it that the fact that he was served in the forum was sufficient and that notwithstanding what this Court held in Shaffer and the language in Shaffer, personal service is still sufficient. 
    The court of appeal denied the petition for a writ in a decision which, again, said that Shaffer, the language in Shaffer, had not changed the traditional rule... it goes by the nickname of transient jurisdiction. 
    It relied on cases such as the Supreme Court's case in Nevada, Cariaga which had said this Court has never directly held that transient jurisdiction is no good so we will apply it until we are instructed otherwise. 
    We're here today to ask you to instruct the courts of this land otherwise, to give effect to what the Court said in Shaffer, that personal jurisdiction in all cases must be tested by the minimum contacts test. 
    Now, it's important to keep in mind that although the doctrine is often called transient jurisdiction or sometimes, more colorfully, gotcha jurisdiction, what's really at issue is not whether the defendant is passing through momentarily. 
    What's at issue is whether the fact of service on a defendant while he is in the forum is alone sufficient. 
    The traditional view that it was founded on the notion that... what jurisdiction is all about, what personal jurisdiction is all about is whether the state has power over the defendant, physical power over the defendant. 
    And it does, according to the traditional view, when a defendant is within its boundaries. 
    That view was long criticized by the commentators and was rejected by this Court in International Shoe and then again in Shaffer. 
    That power, physical power over the defendant is not fundamentally the basis for the exercise of state court jurisdiction.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    But the question that your hypothetical poses is what kinds of contacts would be sufficient under the minimum contacts test for somebody who was not in the state very long. 
    And the answer to that would depend upon applying the minimum contacts test and typically the cause of action has to be related to or rise out of contacts that the defendant has. 
    And in your example, for instance, if somebody is... is in the state transacting some business, even though they are there very briefly, if there is a cause of action that the plaintiff has against that defendant that arises out of his transacting that business, there's no question that under the minimum contacts test--

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    I think what most people would think is if you're within the borders of the state, you're subject to the power, if you will, of the state. 
    If you do something in the state that's wrong, they can arrest you. 
    If you're injured, you can go to the hospital and get treated. 
    And if a cause of action arises out of those activities, I think a defendant could rightfully expect to be sued on them. 
    But if you are in the state for reasons which do not give rise to the cause of action that is sued on, then I don't think you would expect to be subject to a lawsuit over them, which is what happened in this case.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    --Well, I think there's kind of been a mistaken understanding of what that phrase meant. 
    The courts... not this Court because it hasn't addressed it, obviously, but the state courts that have addressed it... have looked at International Shoe and have said if... the language there, if the defendant be not present in the forum. 
    But the issue is not if the defendant be not present in the form. 
    It's if the defendant be not served while present in the forum. 
    If I have... say I'm... I'm a plaintiff and I... in New York I enter into a contract with two defendants in New York and those two defendants then decide to take a trip to Hawaii and they both got to Hawaii contemplating a two-week trip. 
    And there's a dispute between us that arose in New York over the validity of that contract and I decide to sue them in New York. 
    So I file a lawsuit in New York and I get my process server to go to Hawaii and I serve one of them who has been there for a week and then... I'm sorry, I want this lawsuit to be in Hawaii, not in New York. 
    I serve them... one of them in Hawaii who has been there for a week and he calls the other fellow and he says, the process server is here, you'd better leave, and that person leaves a week later. 
    He's been there twice as long and has twice as many contacts, he's not subject to the jurisdiction of Hawaii. 
    But the first fellow is because the process server happened to catch him. 
    And that seems to me to be an irrational result.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    I think it overturned the theoretical underpinning of Pennoyer when it said that power was no longer the basis of jurisdiction. 
    It's true that was in the context of out-of-state defendants, but the reasoning of the decision was to reject the notion that power was the basis of jurisdiction. 
    That's why you can get jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants after International Shoe, because power is not the basis for jurisdiction. 
    If power is not the basis for jurisdiction, then the fact that you physically get power over the defendant no longer can be the basis for jurisdiction either.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    --That's true. 
    The second... second part of my answer to your question is that in Stanley v. Illinois and in Shaffer this Court said that due process should not be sacrificed for the sake of simplicity, that the cost is too high. 
    And Justice Marshall in Shaffer said that quasi in rem jurisdiction, traditional though it may be, and easy to apply though it may be, is not consistent with fundamental notions of due process. 
    And the fact that it's easy and simple and eliminates cost is not sufficient for constitutional scrutiny.

    I think there are several problems with it. 
    It's obviously somewhat of an improvement over the traditional rule because it allows for exceptions. 
    However, I think there are three things wrong with it.

 Well, it struck me as maybe a pretty good statement of what the rule might be. 
 That unless... that jurisdiction does attach unless it's just too attenuated. 
 And the notes refer to special circumstances which might include the criminal case where otherwise there will be no opportunity to arrest the defendant.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    That's true. 
    But in order to accept it jurisprudentially I think this Court would have to say that its prior decisions which indicated that jurisdiction is not fundamentally based upon power are incorrect, that in one sense jurisdiction is to be continually based upon power although the defendant can then show reasons why it shouldn't be exercised... then jurisdiction will not be exercised.

    --It doesn't say that jurisdiction was being upheld on the ground that he has sufficient contacts under the minimum contacts test, and it couldn't have because it was quite obvious that the trial court did not ground jurisdiction on that basis, and it couldn't have because under California law and under this Court's decisions there are insufficient contacts as a matter of law to uphold jurisdiction here for two reasons. 
    The first is that doing business in a state only gives rise to jurisdiction under the traditional test, if that's what the Court thought it was applying, or if that's what this Court wanted to apply, for causes of action arising out of that business. 
    And the cause of action here does not arise out of the business that Mr. Burnham did in California. 
    The wife is seeking to invalidate a marital settlement agreement that she executed in New Jersey. 
    That has nothing to do with the husband's contacts in California. 
    Secondly, California has held in Modlin v. Superior Court, which is in our briefs, that if a person, a father, combines coming to a state to visit his children with doing some business, the combination of those do not meet the minimum contacts test. 
    That's Modlin v. Superior Court, 176 Cal. App. 3d 1176.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    --Because the tradition does not found jurisdiction on the fact that a person is present. 
    It founds jurisdiction on the fact that, while present, the person is served. 
    Now, you can do away with the gotcha theory of jurisdiction and still say that if a person is present in the state, he has a contact with the state. 
    There's no question about that. 
    The question is what significance does his contact have in assessing whether or not the minimum contacts test of International Shoe is met.

speaker="richard_sherman" startTime="1141.016" stopTime="1290.759">
    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In thinking about this matter over the lunch hour it occurred to me that I ought to say that we're really not asking this Court to do anything very radical. 
    Although it's true that the doctrine of transient jurisdiction has been around for a long time, there has been an evolution in the law which has pointed in the direction of abolishing it. 
    In fact, in Shaffer at page 213 the Court said, 
    "We therefore conclude that all assertions of state court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe. " 
    That's been quoted very often. 
    However, there's a footnote to that sentence which has not been quoted very often, and it says, 
    "It would not be fruitful for us to reexamine the facts of cases decided on the rationales of Pennoyer and Harris to determine whether jurisdiction might be sustained under the standards we adopt today. " 
    "To the extent that prior decisions are inconsistent with this standard, they are overruled. " 
    So, already in Shaffer the Court had recognized that the law was moving in the direction of being concerned with fundamental fairness. 
    And I think if you look at the old rule coming out of Pennoyer, it perhaps was fair in 1877 to say that, since you can't get service on the defendant outside the jurisdiction, if you're lucky enough to catch him in the jurisdiction, well, you've gotten him and you've got jurisdiction over him. 
    But after International Shoe liberalized the degree to which you could get jurisdiction over the defendant by service outside the forum, the rationale for saying that you can get jurisdiction over him by serving him in the forum was totally undercut. 
    Therefore, if you abolish the doctrine of transient jurisdiction in this case, all you're doing is kind of completing a trio of cases that started with International Shoe, Shaffer and now this case. 
    Unless you do something to the doctrine of transient jurisdiction, we're stuck with cases like Grace v. MacArthur where you're served if you're flying over and have no contacts. 
    You're stuck with cases where the defendant comes into the forum and just steps over the line and is served with a piece of paper. 
    You're stuck with cases where somebody is on the way to Hawaii and the plane lands in San Francisco airport and they're served and have no other contacts with San Francisco. 
    None of those things would seem to comport with fundamental notions of fair play and substantial justice.

speaker="richard_sherman" startTime="1493.073" stopTime="1662.916">
    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    --And they have statutes which say they may exercise jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the Constitution. 
    There's... there are two additional reasons why... coming back to Justice O'Connor's question earlier today... why I think the Court should not adopt the restatement view if the Court is willing to abolish the pure form of transient jurisdiction which makes everything turn on service. 
    The first is that it would accomplish a shift in the burden. 
    Traditionally it's the plaintiff... when the defendant objects to jurisdiction, it's the plaintiff that has the burden of establishing a basis for jurisdiction. 
    This would put the burden on the defendant to disprove why... to prove why there should not be jurisdiction. 
    And that would be an incentive for plaintiffs to lure defendants to the state and to serve them, as happened in this case, in a way that would interfere with other interests. 
    And I think it would be better if there was one standard that is consistently applied in making the plaintiff establish jurisdiction. 
    Secondly, if you do the restatement view, the restatement says jurisdiction is served in the forum unless otherwise unreasonable. 
    This Court would then have to begin a process of deciding numerous cases to define the parameters of what's reasonable and unreasonable under the restatement test. 
    There's already a body of law from this Court under the minimum contacts test defining what's reasonable and unreasonable, and it would be much simpler for everybody if that body of law was just engrafted on to all assertions of state court jurisdiction. 
    Finally, I close my opening comments this afternoon by saying that if the Court determines that the rule has been around so long that we should keep it even though it may have unfair results, it shouldn't be applied in a case where somebody is served in the state while they're visiting their children, which is what happened in this case. 
    And the reason for that is fundamentally that in Asahi this Court... and in World-Wide Volkswagen this Court made clear that one of the things to be considered in determining whether or not a state is exercising jurisdiction consistent with the Constitution is the degree to which it impacts upon the shared substance and policies of the states. 
    I don't think it's beyond question that the share and substantive policy of the states in the area of child custody visitation is to encourage families of divorce to maintain contact between parents and the children after the divorce. 
    That policy will be impacted adversely by allowing transient jurisdiction in a case where somebody is served while they're visiting their children. 
    Therefore, if the Court does not totally abolish the rule and if the Court does not accept the restatement formulation, or even if it does, one of the things that it should say, it's unreasonable to allow jurisdiction to be predicated upon service on somebody who is in the state when they're seeing their children. 
    I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, if I may.

speaker="james_o_devereaux" startTime="1668.753" stopTime="1751.641">
    Mr. James O. Devereaux 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    In the opinions issued by this Court over the last 45 years, starting with International Shoe, there has been a clear trend toward relaxing limits on state court jurisdiction. 
    As Justice White observed in his opinion in World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, this relaxation is largely attributable to the fundamental transformation of American society that has taken place and which has been accelerated in the last few years. 
    It is ironic that in this case, today as we stand on the threshold of the 21st century at a time when technological progress in travel and communication has resulted in a shrinking of our planet to the size of a global village, and at a time when the citizens of this country, more than at any other time in our history, are more likely to travel across state borders with ease and with increasing frequency, the petitioner is arguing for a retraction of the permissible reach of state jurisdiction and a categorical rule that presence within the boundaries of a... of the forum state should no longer provide the basis for the exercise of state jurisdiction under any circumstances.

    Mr. James O. Devereaux 
    --Well, then my position is that this Court should say that the law has been that presence is sufficient and should continue to say that. 
    It is true that there is an alternative basis, if the Court chooses not to do that, to uphold this decision. 
    And that is, by pointing out that the contacts here... the connection here is significant. 
    I think it's important to point out that state courts always have the right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction. 
    And in fact, probably the most relevant case where that occurred was Kulko, where in fact the California courts did decline to exercise jurisdiction and this Court upheld that judgment on their part. 
    In this case and in Kulko, of course you did not have the actual presence of the defendant, and that is a major distinguishing factor between the facts of this case and the facts of that case. 
    But there are additional important differences as well between this case and the facts in Kulko. 
    And perhaps the most important of those are the fact that here both California and New Jersey have carefully considered the propriety of those respective states assuming jurisdiction in this matter not only on the superior court level but on every level of the state judicial system in both states. 
    And there is no conflict between the decisions of those two states. 
    They both came to consistent conclusions that California is an appropriate state to assume jurisdiction in this case under the circumstances. 
    In addition to that, and in addition to the fact that the husband was not physically present within California in Kulko, here you have more substantial contacts, more substantial connection between the defendant/husband and the state. 
    And on that basis, I think that the exercise of jurisdiction is eminently reasonable. 
    In addition to all of those factors, here you have California being the state of domicile of the wife and the children. 
    I think that the decisions issued by this Court in recent years, starting with Kulko and continuing with World-Wide Volkswagen and Burger King and Keeton and Asahi Metal Industries, may reveal a shift in the analytical approach that the Court is taking toward the question of fairness and substantial justice, a shift in favor of evaluating the various interests and the other factors that are involved in the case. 
    And particularly in a family law case, the fact of domicile of one of the spouses and the children, the interests of the state of domicile in the litigation in the subject matter of the case is an extremely important factor to be taken into consideration.

speaker="james_o_devereaux" startTime="2354.644" stopTime="2578.804">
    Mr. James O. Devereaux 
    Well, Justice Scalia, I, of course, can't speak to the reasons for the Court's granting cert. in this case. 
    That is an important issue and I am not trying to persuade the Court to avoid deciding that issue. 
    I believe that the Court should uphold the decision on that basis. 
    But what I am suggesting is that this case also provides an opportunity, should the Court desire to take the opportunity, to decide the case on alternative grounds as well, one of which is the question of sufficient connection or contacts, another of which is an evaluation of California's interest as a state of domicile and the interests of the wife and children in this case. 
    The Court, of course, has no obligation to decide those issues and can limit its decision to the issue of the continued viability of the presence basis. 
    But the... the case does involve... commend itself to these additional alternative grounds, should the Court desire to address them because they were raised below in the state courts and have been preserved. 
    They are in the record, and depending upon the approach that the Court would like to take, those issues are available for a decision. 
    But if the Court desires to limit its decision to the issue of whether or not the presence of the defendant within the state and service of process upon him while he was present continues to be a sufficient jurisdictional basis, then my position is that the answer to that is yes. 
    It has not only been... that principle has not only been established in Pennoyer v. Neff, but it has in fact been acknowledge by this Court in more modern decisions, including International Shoe, where the Court expressly acknowledged that the minimum contacts analysis related to service outside the state where the defendant was not present but at least by implication recognized that if a defendant is present within the state, that is a valid jurisdictional basis. 
    The O'Neill v. New York case was also an application of the presence rule where the Court clearly said, the defendant being present in Florida, Florida had jurisdiction over him. 
    So that all I'm suggesting is that based on the precedent established by this Court in more than one case over the last 100-plus years, an upholding of the judgment of the California courts can be accomplished simply by recognizing that the rule continues to be in effect. 
    And I think it's particularly significant that when the commentators argued that Shaffer v. Heitner required at least a reevaluation of the presence rule, if not an outright abolishing of it, the American Law Institute did reexamine that rule and concluded that it was not appropriate to abolish the rule but instead retained the rule in a slightly modified version. 
    And I think this is an indication that the presence rule is valid, it's not unfair and unreasonable and it does lend certainty and predictability to the jurisdictional equation. 
    So, to the extent that this Court wants to limit its decision to that narrow issue, I would urge the Court to uphold the judgment of the California courts. 
    Thank you very much.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    Yes. 
    I think that counsel kind of concedes that Grace v. MacArthur is unfair. 
    It offends our traditional notions of what's fair. 
    The next step is to say that that means that since it's a question of fairness, it has to be fact-specific to each case. 
    And that's the nature of due process. 
    That's the nature of the inquiry into due process. 
    It has to be, and that is why in Kulko the Court said in this area the grays predominate. 
    And they have to because otherwise, if you're stuck with this absolute notion that physical power is what jurisdiction is about, then you're stuck with Grace v. MacArthur and nobody seriously defends that.

    Mr. Richard Sherman 
    --If the territory of the state extends to the air space, then apparently they do. 
    But it's not, as I started to say before the lunch bell rang, it's not because they're present in the state; it's because they were served while present in the state. 
    You see, service while present is what accomplished transient jurisdiction. 
    I'm not contending that if somebody is present in the state that should not be counted in the minimum contacts analysis. 
    If a person is present, he has a contact. 
    But then he's only subject to specific jurisdiction for causes of action relating to his presence. 
    If he is served under the traditional rule, he's subject to general jurisdiction for anything, and that's what makes it unfair. 
    With respect to the options open to this Court, it seems to me that the court of appeal clearly decided this case on the bounds... grounds of transient jurisdiction being okay. 
    I think that issue is directly presented here by virtue of the petition for cert. and the court of appeal opinion. 
    In Shaffer v. Heitner, when this Court rejected quasi in rem jurisdiction even though the Delaware court had not reviewed the matter of well, but are there minimum contacts, the Court went on to do so, concluded not and reversed. 
    I think that's what the Court should do here. 
    But at worst for husband, the Court should abolish the doctrine of transient jurisdiction in its pure form, and then, if it adopts the restatement analysis or if it replaces it with minimum contacts, at worse for husband, simply remand that part of the case to the court of appeal to consider whether, now that it can't base it simply on service while present in the forum, what should it do? 
    I'm quite confident that under California law it will reach the result which it reached in this case.
