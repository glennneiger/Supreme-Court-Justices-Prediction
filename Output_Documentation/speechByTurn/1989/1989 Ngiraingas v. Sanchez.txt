    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case also comes to us from the Ninth Circuit. 
    The issue is whether the territory of Guam and its officials are subject to suit under a statute known as 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. 
    The District Court dismissed claims asserted under that statute, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we also affirm, and we hold that “neither the territory nor any of its officers acting in their official capacities is a person” under the statute. 
    Justice Scalia joins the opinion except for part 2B; Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Justice Marshall. 
    Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
