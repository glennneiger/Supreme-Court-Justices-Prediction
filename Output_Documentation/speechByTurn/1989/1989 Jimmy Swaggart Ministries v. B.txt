    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to the court on appeal from the Court of Appeals of California. 
    In an opinion filed today, we hold that California’s imposition of sales and use tax liability on a religious organization’s sale of religious materials does not contravene the religion clauses of the First Amendment. 
    The collection on payment of a generally applicable sales and use tax does not violate the Free Exercise Clause because such a tax imposes no constitutionally significant burden on an adherence religious practices or beliefs. 
    Neither does such a tax violate the Establishment Clause because a state does not foster excessive entanglement with religion simply by imposing these generally applicable administrative and record-keeping duties on religious organizations. 
    Because the issue is not decided below, we do not reach the claims that imposition of the tax on certain mail order sales violates the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. 
    The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is affirmed and the decision of this Court is unanimous.
