Fort Stewart Schools v. Federal Labor Relations Authority

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning No. 89-65, Fort Stewart Schools v. Federal Labor Relations Authority. 
    Mr. Wright.
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="11.089" stopTime="113.773">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Army operates schools for the dependents of personnel stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. 
    This case arose when the union that represents the teachers at those schools made a number of proposals relating to wages and fringe benefits, including a proposal to increase wages across the board by 13.5 percent. 
    The Army refused to negotiate, relying on various provisions of the Federal Labor Management Relations statute and on a statute and a regulation specifically directed to the dependents' schools. 
    The FLRA held that the proposals are negotiable in a divided opinion, and the court of appeals affirmed. 
    We believe that the Army's refusal to bargain is justified for three reasons. 
    First, Congress did not make wages negotiable in the Federal sector. 
    Second, it instead gave agency management control of agency budgets. 
    And third, the salaries of teachers at the dependents' schools are to be set by comparison with the salaries of teachers at the local public schools. 
    Before I discuss those three reasons, I'd like to emphasize that it is undisputed that the vast majority of Federal employees may not bargain about pay. 
    The pay of most Federal employees is set by the general schedule and such employees, about a million and a half in all, are paid what Congress says in the general schedule they are paid. 
    The FLRA has changed its position with respect to another large group of employees--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="113.773" stopTime="122.629">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Wright, with respect to that first category of employees, is bargaining over their wages specifically excluded by the act, by the FLRA?
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="122.629" stopTime="183.685">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    --It... it works that way. 
    We... we... it is undisputed we think for three reasons. 
    A... there is nothing in the act that says general schedule employees cannot bargain about wages in so many words. 
    However, the portion of the act that makes... that mandates bargaining, says that bargaining is not permitted where a matter is specifically provided by Federal statute. 
    That is Section 7109(a)(14)(c). 
    In addition, Section 7117 provides that a proposal cannot be in conflict with a Federal law, and a... and a proposal to pay someone differently than what Congress has set in the Federal schedule would be contrary to law. 
    Both the union and the FLRA would agree with that I believe. 
    They would not agree with our third point that the management rights provision which gives management control of the agency budget also means that... that the pay of general schedule employees can't be set by statute.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    The FLRC, the FLRA's predecessor, did hold in two cases that pay was negotiable. 
    And you've gone to the strongest point in their case, so let me... let me address it right now. 
    As the D.C. Circuit stated in its excellent opinion in the overseas schools case, we believe that the practice under the FLRC and the executive order regime has been superseded by the FLRA, for the reasons the D.C. Circuit gave and the reasons I will give in the bulk of my argument. 
    Namely, that the language Congress used, the statements it made in the legislative history, and its reservation to management of control of the budget confirm that Congress did not want bargaining over wages under the Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute. 
    I'd like to make two other points with respect to the FLRC decisions. 
    First, whether wages were working conditions was not raised in either of those cases. 
    The FLRC never specifically decided that issue. 
    Second, it's clear that Congress was not aware of those two decisions. 
    In fact, Senator Sasser told the Senate that, under the FLRC... the FLRC had held that under the executive order regime that wages are not negotiable. 
    Now, normally Congress does intend to carry forward prior practice. 
    But we think that it intends to carry forward the prior practice as it understands it.

    It specifically said wages are negotiable.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    --Well, in this case, of course, it's... conditions of employment are defined to include matters affecting working conditions. 
    So Congress has used somewhat a different language here. 
    What we think is most important is looking at both the NLRA and the Postal Reorganization Act. 
    The two times Congress has made wages negotiable, it has said so specifically. 
    The Postal Reorganization Act to our mind is actually the most analogous statute because it also affects Federal employees and because the committees here that drafted the bill... the House committee was the Committee on the Postal Service and the Civil Service. 
    In the Postal Reorganization Act in 1971 Congress made wages, hours and conditions of employment... I'm sorry... wages, hours and working conditions negotiable. 
    It specifically said, as it said in the... in the NLRA, that wages are negotiable.

    How... how much weight would we ordinarily give to the action of Congress in 1935 says wages are to be bargained about under the NLRA? 
    Congress in 1971 says they are to be bargained about in the Postal Service Act. 
    Then Congress comes along seven years after in '78 and says conditions of employment. 
    It seems to me that inference is not as strong, or as if you are talking about the same statute where Congress says one thing in one section and uses a different phrase in another section.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    It would be a better case for us were that the case. 
    But those are the three situations were Congress has made matters bargainable. 
    The two times it has made wages bargainable, it has said wages. 
    The Postal Reorganization Act was very much on Congress' mind in... in enacting this statute. 
    Congressman Udall, who authored the compromise that was enacted, specifically contrasted the practice under the Postal Reorganization Act to what... the practice under his bill. 
    And he assured his colleagues that pay would not be negotiable under this statute, saying that the bargainability of wages for the Postal Employees had been very troublesome. 
    In addition, two proposals were made to Congress to make wages negotiable. 
    Congressman Ford proposed a bill that would have made wages generally negotiable, and Congressman Heftel introduced a more limited proposal that would have made pay negotiable so far as consonant with the law and regulation. 
    Neither of these proposals were enacted. 
    They were both rejected, and we think that that is significant.

    --Yes. 
    Yes. 
    That's... we... we think that in that statute, in a nutshell, Section 241 and Subsection (a) says that these schools are to be comparable to schools in the states where they are located. 
    Subsection (e) says that the per-pupil costs of the dependents' schools shall not exceed, so far as practicable, the per-pupil costs at the local public schools. 
    Now, the Army has interpreted that reasonably, in our view, to mean that if you are going to offer comparable education at a comparable per-pupil cost, you have to pay teachers comparably.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    --The statute says that the education has to be comparable and that the per-public costs have to be comparable. 
    It is the regulation that says that salaries schedules have to be comparable. 
    I'd like to make one other point with respect to our... our primary contention, our contention that wages are not negotiable. 
    This statute is different from the private sector in that, if a matter is negotiable, the Federal Service Impasses Panel can impose a proposal on an agency over its objection. 
    So, in this case, if the FLRA prevails, the salaries of dependents' school's teachers could ultimately be set by arbitrators rather than by the agency. 
    We think, especially in that circumstance, if Congress wanted not only to make wages negotiable but to allow a system where they might ultimately be set by... outside the agency, it surely would have said so in the statute.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    They certainly can. 
    Let me make one other point with respect to our argument that wages aren't conditions of employment, and... and that is that after the Ford and Heftel proposals were rejected, congressman after congressman got up on the floor of the House and assured their colleagues that wages weren't negotiable. 
    And... and we think that that reinforces our conclusion. 
    In addition, on our second argument that the budget right gives agencies control of the budget, the first thing I would like to say with respect to that is that the... the budget right, which says that nothing in the... in the Civil Service Reform Act shall affect the authority of agency management to determine the budget of the agency reinforces our first position. 
    We think that it would be contradictory for Congress to state simultaneously that management has control of the budget but wages are on the bargaining table. 
    Since wages could ultimately be set by arbitration--

    Yes, I believe so because what they... near as we can tell, they seemed to think that an across the board pay increase would improve employee morale and that would be the compensating benefit here that would outweigh the costs of the 13.5 percent proposal. 
    Now, I suppose employee morale improving might cut down on turnover and ultimately lead to some monetary saving.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Well, I think that's the other side's position. 
    The heart of the problem with the FLRA's test on the budget, I'd like to say, is made clear on page 15 of its brief where it says cost doesn't matter. 
    More specifically, it says that the cost of a proposal alone is an insufficient basis to find interference with the statute's budget right. 
    In the NRC case, which this Court... which is pending before the Court right now, a 20 percent pay raise was proposed, which would cost the agency $32 million annually. 
    The cost of that proposal alone doesn't rule it out under FLRA's agency... under the FLRA's budget test. 
    If there are no further questions at this time, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

   Argument of William E. Persina
speaker="william_e_persina" startTime="1445.989" stopTime="1514.617">
    Mr. William E. Persina 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Authority's holding in this case, affirmed by a unanimous court of appeals, stands on three eminently reasonable points. 
    First, that the compensation paid to a Federal employee for work performed constitutes an aspect of that employee's work relationship with his or her employer. 
    Indeed, compensation is probably the primary condition upon which the employment relationship is initiated and maintained. 
    So for the relative handful of Federal employees, such as those in this case, whose compensation is not established in statute, compensation is a mandatory bargaining subject under the Federal Sector Labor law. 
    The authorities second point is that simply because a bargaining proposal entails an initial or facial cost, that is not enough of a reason in itself to conclude that implementation of the proposal will interfere with the agency's budget right. 
    Rather, that agency employer must show that the real cost impact of that proposal, after its compensating benefits are taken into account, will require the agency to seek more money through the budget process to conduct its affairs than it had originally determined was necessary. 
    And that is a showing that the employer agency in this case has not made.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1514.617" stopTime="1529.995">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is it... would that showing have to discount not only the economic benefit of... but the tangible economic benefit for the agency but also the kind of intangible, such as employee morale factor?
speaker="william_e_persina" startTime="1529.995" stopTime="1544.921">
    Mr. William E. Persina 
    Well, as Mr. Wright indicated, some of the intangibles will very frequently be able to be converted into tangibles. 
    Really, the analysis is little more than the familiar cost/benefit analysis that is a commonly used tool both inside and outside the government for management planning.

    On the one hand it does recognize the employers' allegations, or the ability of an employer to allege that the real cost impact of the proposal, after the compensating benefits are considered, may require the agency to seek more money to run its operations than it had originally determine was necessary. 
    But on the other hand it recognizes that cost alone, or a cost consequence alone, cannot be said to require that agency to go to the budget process and... and seek more money. 
    It really requires a consideration of all of those benefits and debits of the proposal. 
    And I think that's a reasonable--

    --Well, I think what... as I remember in the Wright-Patterson test, the types of compensating benefits in Volume 2 of FLRA deal with such things as grievance filing rates, productivity, and I believe morale may be mentioned as one of the compensating benefits factors. 
    But I think the state of the law right now is the Authority has not ruled it out. 
    It would take that showing, if... if the employer suggested it. 
    I don't think the offset need be a dollar and cent exact figure as far as requiring the agency to show that. 
    An agency that shows that there's enough of a chance, that there is a substantial amount of money that will be needed or a significant amount of money that would be needed to be obtained in addition to what they thought they need to run the schools, I would think would win their compensating benefits analysis. 
    But we don't even have an employer here who is attempting to make any showing on that issue. 
    And I think what we really have here is the reasonableness of the test. 
    And how the Authority treats things like intangible benefits of a proposal as opposed to tangible, I think really remains to be seen over time when some agency employers start trying to meet the test on its terms rather than attacking it. 
    We think it's a reasonable test that's entitled to a chance, and no agency employer has done that yet. 
    So, I think that's where the state of the law is on the issue now.

    Well, Your Honor, I think in those laws, the Postal Reorganization Act and the NLRA, Congress manifestly wanted to make pay negotiable for all employees who were covered under that law. 
    Under the Federal Sector statute, the situation is very different. 
    Congress manifestly wanted to make pay non-negotiable for the overwhelming majority of Federal employees but had no concern with the relatively few pockets of Federal employees who are free to negotiate their wages because Congress has not... has chosen not to set them through legislation.

    Mr. William E. Persina 
    --Well, it does not include wages because of the operation of the statutory exclusion from the substantive definition. 
    It does not exclude wages because of the substantive definition itself. 
    And that is a large part of our point here. 
    Yes, indeed, Congress did seek to make pay nonnegotiable for the great majority of Federal employees, but it did it in 7103(a)(14)(C), not in the substantive definition. 
    The term personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions clearly fits wages. 
    All three of those categories, we think, eminently cover wages. 
    Indeed, we think a claim that the main quid for working... the quo for working, is compensation. 
    And we think that is plain in terms of just looking at an employee who is dissatisfied with his or her pay. 
    That employee will seek to sever that employment relationship. 
    So pay can go to the very existence of the employment relationship itself. 
    And, indeed, we think it's a major failing of the schools' case here, that they have offered us no workable theory whatsoever for why it is that compensation does not constitute personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions. 
    But the strength of that point, that compensation is a condition of employment in this case for these employees, is supported not just by the plain language of the definition itself. 
    It is also supported by the executive order practice that took place prior to the statute. 
    Both Executive Orders 10988 and 11491 delineated the scope of bargain subjects by saying that personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions were within the scope of the bargaining obligation. 
    And that language is obviously virtually identical in all significant respects to the definition of conditions of employment here. 
    And really, contrary to my brother Wright's remarks earlier in the argument that the executive orders did not reference conditions of employment, in the preambles to both those executive orders, Congress did just that. 
    It said that employees should be able to work... to negotiate on the conditions of their employment. 
    In Section 11(a) of the executive orders it then said that personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions were proper bargaining subjects. 
    So we think it plain that Congress was looking in the statute to carry over that executive order practice. 
    And I would also indicate that in the Federal Labor Relations Council's Merchant Marine decision, which we've cited in our brief, Congress did explicitly say that compensation... or the Council, rather, said that compensation is a personnel policy and practice and matter affecting working conditions. 
    And the only way under the executive orders that compensation was made non-negotiable, was through its being established in legislation and that is precisely the system that Congress carried over under the statute. 
    So the situation in Federal sector labor relations at the time that Congress considered the statute was clear. 
    Compensation did constitute personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions and was only non-negotiable if it was established through legislation. 
    And there is nothing in the legislative history of the statute which shows that Congress wanted to change that situation. 
    In fact, there are a number of indicators that Congress wanted to maintain just that state of affairs under the statute, both in its language... in its choice of language in the statute and the debates that took place. 
    As to the language, we've already seen. 
    Congress adopted the same substantive parameters for the bargaining relationship and it made pay non-negotiable for most employees by... by inserting the proviso that matters specifically established in Federal statute are non-negotiable. 
    That's just the way it was done under the executive orders. 
    And I would also point to Section 7135(b) of the statute where Congress said that it wanted, among other things, the decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Council to continue in effect or until changed by the statute itself or through decisions of the FLRA. 
    And neither of those events have occurred. 
    So we think it plain that Congress' treatment of the executive order practice makes it clear that it intended to carry that practice over. 
    But the debates among the key legislators in the bill also support that conclusion. 
    The legislators... and among them I am speaking of Congressmen Clay, Ford, Udall and Collins, who are among some of the most important figures in the enactment of the statute... all said and made clear their understanding that compensation would not be negotiable under the statute because it would be set by legislation of the Congress. 
    And we have cited these passages on pages 28 and 29 of our brief. 
    And these remarks must form our backdrop for the selected excerpts from the legislative history that the schools rely on so heavily here, where legislators would simply say that pay would be non-negotiable without specifying how that result would be achieved. 
    And yet that is the key inquiry for the legislative history. 
    How is that result to be achieved? 
    And as I've indicated, we think it plain that the only intent for those remarks can be to make it non-negotiable through operation of legislation. 
    And I can state this conclusion with a very sound foundation, and that is the language of the statute itself. 
    Because if Congress really meant by those remarks that it wanted to pay... make pay non-negotiable as a subject matter per se, it would have said so in the statute. 
    And yet we will look long and hard in that law before we will find an express exclusion of pay matters. 
    Rather, what we see is, well, the Authority's view of the legislative history and that is that pay is made non-negotiable to the extent, considerable as it is, that Congress wanted to control that matter through legislation. 
    So it is the Authority's view of the legislative history that finds voice in the language of the statute and not the schools'. 
    And for that reason we think the Authority's view should be affirmed.

speaker="william_e_persina" startTime="2426.865" stopTime="2515.656">
    Mr. William E. Persina 
    That is not correct, Your Honor. 
    Panel decisions are reviewable indirectly for sufficiency with law. 
    And the D.C. Circuit has so held, among other circuits I believe. 
    If an agency employer believes their panel decision is contrary to law, it can refuse to comply with that panel decision, take an unfair labor practice which the Authority would resolve, and the Authority's unfair labor practice ruling would be reviewed in an appropriate circuit court of appeals. 
    So there is indirect review. 
    Counsel Prison Locals v. Brewer is the primary case which talks about that. 
    That is in volume 735 F. 2d, although the page number is forgotten to me at the moment. 
    But we would also note, while we are talking about the panel, there is at least one case that I know of where, for Merchant Marine Academy instructors, the panel had a bargaining pay... an impasse in bargaining that dealt with setting pay. 
    And the... this is a Merchant Marine case where the panel went with the employer's point of view. 
    That is the one we know of where salary rates themselves were the primary focus of the impasse. 
    Again, these don't come up very often for the panel, because pay is non-negotiable for so many employees. 
    But they ruled for the employer in that case. 
    And we think that the notion that the panel is some rogue body that is off doing irrational things and can't be reviewed is simply wrong. 
    They have demonstrated responsible conduct in this area, and their decisions are subject to review. 
    So the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2515.656" stopTime="2534.068">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Are those decisions... is it like baseball free agency where the panel has to pick either one proposal or the other, or can it come up with a... can it say... can it say either your proposal is... has to be accepted or your proposal can be rejected? 
    Or can it have some sort of a compromise?
speaker="william_e_persina" startTime="2534.068" stopTime="2677.426">
    Mr. William E. Persina 
    --Well, Your Honor, under the plain language of Section 7119 it can take any action it deems necessary to resolve an impasse and that could include... and the panel has frequently not adopted either the employer or the union, but has developed some third course. 
    In concluding on the conditions of employment point, I would just like to note briefly concerning these... this battle over the outside statutes that we seem to be engaged in here, inappropriate as it is, we think. 
    Nonetheless, we think these outside laws are very much supportive of our case. 
    The National Labor Relations Act expressly equates wages with conditions of employment. 
    We would also prefer to look closer to home for the statute. 
    That is, the Senior Executive Service Act, which again expressly equates compensation with conditions of employments, as we've pointed out in our brief. 
    The Senior Executive Service law is another title of the Civil Service Reform Act, Title IV, the Authority is under Title VII. 
    And here in the Reform Act itself is Congress' recognition that compensation is a form of a condition of employment. 
    So if we are to engage in this... this debate about what do outside law show, we think, if anything, it's supportive. 
    But the real point, we think, on conditions of employment, is to look at our statute. 
    That's the statute that's before us and that statute defines the very term that we are seeking to construe and apply here. 
    And it does it in a way that clearly encompasses compensation. 
    And that should be the end of the matter. 
    I would just like to conclude on the condition of employment point by being so presumptuous, I think, as to suggest to this Court what kind of opinion it would have to write in order to grant the schools' position here. 
    First of all, it would have to explain why it is that compensation is not a personnel policy, practice or matter affecting working conditions. 
    Failing that, it would have to engraft under the statute an exception for pay which is not in the law. 
    It would also have to explain why it is that the key legislators in the statute kept saying that pay would be non-negotiable because it would be regulated through legislation. 
    And the Court would also have to identify exactly where it is in the legislative history that the... that the Congress decided that it did not want to carry over the executive order practice. 
    That is a very daunting task, I would suggest. 
    We think that it is a task that need not be confronted because the--

    Mr. William E. Persina 
    Certainly. 
    But the task need not be faced because the right view of this case on this issue is the Authority's point. 
    I'd like to now turn to the budget issue and that test that we consider here, whether the union's proposals constitute or entail significant and unavoidable costs that are not offset by compensating benefits. 
    And this analysis is called for under the Authority's long-established budget test for determining when a proposal interferes with the budget right. 
    I do want to stress again the reasonableness of this test is an accommodation. 
    Many of the bargaining proposals entail a facial or initial cost, and that reason is... cannot be enough in itself to find that proposal to be non-negotiable.

    Mr. William E. Persina 
    --Well, Your Honor, I can think of little to add beyond what I already have. 
    But I do think that many of the intangibles have a tangible outlet and that we cannot separate the intangible from the tangible because so often they will relate. 
    And, again, I would stress that the Authority has at no time indicated that it is seeking an exact dollar and cent offset as an accounting certainty in order to satisfy the test. 
    But I do think that the particulars of the administration of the test, as far as how intangibles and tangibles are married up by the Authority, is... is one that the Authority is entitled to develop through case law as agency employers seek to comply with the test, which this one and others have not done. 
    But the test... to do otherwise, we think... to do otherwise in a compensating benefits analysis would restrict the scope of bargaining so severely under the statute that Congress could not have intended that.

    Mr. William E. Persina 
    --Well, yes, Your Honor. 
    The burden is placed on the employer, and I think its properly placed, at least as an initial matter, for two very good reasons. 
    Number one, it is the employer who is asserting the right. 
    Number two, it is the employer who knows best what its operation is all about and what sort of effects a particular bargaining proposal will have on that operation as a cost matter. 
    And again, I come back to this sort of analysis as being something that is not at all, or should not be at all, alien to... to agency employers. 
    So we don't think that the burden is inappropriately placed. 
    What the... what the employer must show is that the benefits do not offset the costs. 
    And again, that is a matter that is... we think should be within the ability of agency managers to do. 
    I would assume they do it in the absence of a compensating benefits test for a particular course of action they may have under consideration.

    Mr. William E. Persina 
    As a final matter, I would like to turn to the issue of Section 241 and the agency regulation which purports to implement that statutory section. 
    And here we deal with the Authority's compelling need criterion as to whether the regulation is a nondiscretionary implementation of a statutory mandate. 
    In other words, is this regulation the only regulation that can be written to be consistent with the statute? 
    And we submit that it clearly is not, that the regulation is an exercise of discretion by this agency and therefore cannot bar bargaining under the Federal Sector Labor Statute. 
    Even a cursory examination of Section 241 reveals that it does not require identity of compensation between Section 6 schools and local schools. 
    Rather, Section 241 sets two goals. 
    The first is of comparable education quality to local schools, and the second is that that education be provided at a comparable cost or equivalent cost to local schools. 
    Overall per-pupil costs, I would stress. 
    But it is clear that this section does not restrict the discretion of how the agency goes about meeting those bottom-line statutory goals. 
    Under Section 241 these schools have the discretion to bargain on these pay proposals and still to meet those goals. 
    Schools can configure their costs over the various aspects of providing an education in a variety of different ways, and no one way can be said to provide a better education than any other way. 
    It would simply be a different approach to the problem of providing a quality education to students. 
    For example in this case, Section 6 schools could seek to teach math through... in order to implement these proposals, could teach math by hiring more master's degree teachers. 
    And because, if they... if there were salary increases in the schools, then they would be attracting more highly-qualified people to teach in the schools. 
    And therefore, they could teach with higher quality people but be teaching may be with pencil and paper instead of having bachelor's degree teachers, which would teach with electronic calculators. 
    Those choices under-- 
    I notice that my time has expired.

speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="3181.112" stopTime="3253.740">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    I'd like to make just a few points. 
    First, with respect to the first issue as to whether wages are negotiable conditions of employment, I believe Justice White pointed out that it appears that the FLRA's position is that Congress deliberately left wages out of the... out of the statute. 
    It knew that 97 percent of the employees couldn't bargain about wages, and so it took wages out of the statute. 
    We think that rather than... that this Court would have to engraft wages into the statute to... to write an opinion going the other way. 
    With respect to the legislative history on that issue, no one ever said on the floor of Congress that employees, like these teachers, could bargain about pay. 
    With respect to the other statutes that have been mentioned, not one of those makes wages negotiable without saying wages are negotiable. 
    On the budget point, as I understand the discussion that went on, the FLRA's position is not only that intangibles might outweigh the costs but that--
