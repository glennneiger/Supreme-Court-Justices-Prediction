Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens By and Through Mergens
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="134.537">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    This case presents issues central to the operation of co-curricular activities in the public secondary schools in this country. 
    Of critical importance in that regard, obviously, is the equal access act, which was enacted by Congress in the fall of 1984. 
    The act basically provides that a school which conducts, or has a limited open forum, may not deny access to that forum on the basis of the political, philosophical or religious content of speech. 
    In that regard, the Congress defined "limited open forum" to mean when a school district grants an opportunity for one or more noncurriculum-related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time. 
    It is that statutory framework which causes difficulty in school districts in trying to comply with the act and meet their educational obligations. 
    The Equal Access Act, as we see it, basically balances three concerns: certainly the free speech rights of students in our public schools; certainly also it balances a concern of nonestablishment of religion; and certainly also it affords deference to school officials, affords them the autonomy and discretion to make educational decisions. 
    In that context, we urge the Court to interpret the act, interpret noncurriculum-related, as that term is used in the act, to encompass a situation which is not found at Westside High School. 
    All of the student clubs and organizations at Westside High School were under, by school board policy, the direct control and supervision of the administration and shall have a faculty sponsor. 
    The record is replete with testimony that the school officials maintained an active role in practice, in determining the goals and objectives of student clubs and organizations and the manner in which those clubs and organizations operated in their school.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Daubman, is there some provision in the Federal act that at least with regard to clubs covered by the act would limit the participation of the faculty sponsor?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="150.196" stopTime="166.824">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    The act basically provides that a school district that has a safe harbor provision, which basically provides that a school district does not have to provide a faculty sponsor, but if it does so in terms of a role of a monitor, that that is permitted under the act.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="166.824" stopTime="174.247">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And it goes further and says the sponsor will act as no more than a custodian, in effect?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="174.247" stopTime="174.747">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="174.747" stopTime="177.566">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That the faculty sponsor will not be active?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="177.566" stopTime="178.332">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    That is correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="178.332" stopTime="189.256">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you suppose the act would be applied so as to limit the participation of the sponsor for the scuba class, for example... the Scuba Club?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="189.256" stopTime="202.397">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    The sponsor for the Scuba Club, in our particular case there were really... there was a faculty sponsor that was subject to the direction of the administration.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="202.397" stopTime="211.853">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I'm just asking whether the Federal act would apply across the board to all clubs covered by the act, whether they are religious or not?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="211.853" stopTime="213.139">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="213.139" stopTime="221.645">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So that the type of participation you've been describing would not be permitted under the Federal act by the faculty sponsor?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="221.645" stopTime="236.154">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    What... the problem presented is that we did not have a forum at the high school and therefore not a forum under the Equal Access Act which provided for custodial sponsors, but rather provided for active participation.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="236.154" stopTime="239.189">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I thought the court below found that you did have a forum.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="239.189" stopTime="243.908">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    The district court found otherwise. 
    The court below reversed that--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="243.908" stopTime="244.408">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="244.408" stopTime="245.093">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="245.093" stopTime="245.576">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="245.576" stopTime="246.326">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    And in that regard--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="246.326" stopTime="264.238">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So we're talking about the present situation. 
    Let me ask you one other question. 
    Does the school have classes in the regularly offered courses for credit in scuba and in chess?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="264.238" stopTime="310.802">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --No, it does not, Your Honor. 
    But what our school district does have... what our high school does have is an extensive physical education curriculum, mandated at least in part by state educational guidelines and the school district felt that the Scuba Diving Club, called Subsurfers in our school, was certainly related to that... the regular curriculum offerings, to no lesser extent, other than the degree of participation, than other athletic endeavors that are maintained as co-curricular activities, whether that be organized sports teams or intramural competition... all of those activities.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="310.802" stopTime="325.212">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but am I correct, Mr. Daubman, that even if you had no classes that related to scuba diving or athletics you would still maintain that a Scuba Club would be non... would be... would not make... not convert the school into a limited public forum, wouldn't you?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="325.212" stopTime="341.322">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    That's not entirely correct. 
    The... if there were no physical education classes at the school it would be difficult to say that that was one of the educational objectives of the school, and therefore the Scuba Diving Club related to that. 
    I don't think that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="341.322" stopTime="361.566">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I thought your test was a little... was one that, if the school could sponsor the activity as a curriculum activity, that it would be all right to have a club, even though it didn't have a class. 
    For example, supposing you had a French Club, but you had no French classes. 
    Would you say that would make it a... bring the act into play?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="361.566" stopTime="362.835">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --It would not--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="362.835" stopTime="365.703">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Under your view. 
    I'm not asking you to--
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="365.703" stopTime="370.689">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --Under my view, it would not bring the act into play.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="370.689" stopTime="371.305">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --And the reasons?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="371.305" stopTime="378.027">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    The absence of a French class does not mean the absence of foreign language department. 
    There are many education--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="378.027" stopTime="389.918">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, say there's no foreign language department... let me push you... but you still want to have a French class on the theory that it's the kind of activity a school can sponsor without getting into all these sensitive issues?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="389.918" stopTime="413.683">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --If the club's object... goals and objectives were instruction or discourse regarding the French language, then I would agree with you. 
    If it was to... if the goals and objectives of that club, as developed through the faculty sponsor and the administration, dealt with French culture or French history, then there would be, I think, quite a strong relationship to the European studies programs.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="413.683" stopTime="435.547">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Daubman, one of your clubs involves helping handicapped children. 
    Wasn't that one of the clubs which you related to your curriculum because you said that it's part of the responsibility... there is no class in that. 
    It was just a means of teaching community responsibility, as I recall. 
    Isn't that your justification?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="435.547" stopTime="447.688">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Well, the name of the club, or the activity, is Peer Advocates. 
    First of all, that was something that was initiated by a teacher as opposed by a student and would therefore fall outside the act.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="447.688" stopTime="449.540">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is that?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="449.540" stopTime="452.409">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Because the act talks about clubs that are student initiated.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="452.409" stopTime="470.120">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Oh, that's for the club... for a club to be entitled to be admitted under the act, it has to be student initiated, but I don't read the act anywhere as saying that for purposes of the test of the act, of whether you're a limited forum, the club has to be student initiated. 
    Where does it say that?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="470.120" stopTime="481.242">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    It... what it says is that the act provides that student... that it applies to student initiated clubs.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="481.242" stopTime="509.694">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, it says 
    "a public secondary school has a limited open forum whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum-related student groups. " 
    It does not say student initiated. 
    It says student initiated later, when it describes the type of club that is entitled to plead the benefit of the act. 
    That has to be student-initiated, but it seems to me that any act, whether it's... any club, whether it's initiated by the school itself or by a student, triggers the act.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="509.694" stopTime="549.736">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Quite apart from that, with respect to Peer Advocates, the situation presented there... two points: first of all, that was... purposes of the pretrial stipulation, in terms of what clubs were going to be determined to be at issue as to whether they were noncurriculum-related for purposes this... of this lawsuit, was raised for the first time on appeal in the briefs. 
    It was not something that was tried to the trial court and I don't believe it was even argued in the Eighth Circuit, but discussed for the first time in briefs on appeal here. 
    Therefore we did not have any opportunity, certainly, at trial or otherwise, to respond to that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="549.736" stopTime="551.605">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Did you make this point in your briefs? 
    I don't--
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="551.605" stopTime="553.121">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="553.121" stopTime="561.777">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --What about the Chess Club? 
    What... how is that curriculum related? 
    That is related to math, as I recall.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="561.777" stopTime="601.038">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Yes, it is, and logical thought processes that are associated with that. 
    The history of the Chess Club at the high school, as shown by the record in this case, was something that was conducted in the math... before it was a club, was conducted in the math resource room at the urging, and being allowed by the head of the math department because of his feeling that it... those who participated actively in chess became, and continue to be, better math students. 
    In the math resource room that became disruptive, and for that reason it was relegated to a club situation--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="601.038" stopTime="617.364">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Could teachers at different schools take different positions about whether or not the Chess Club is curriculum related? 
    Suppose you have two identical schools, two identical chess clubs, but one math teacher says well, I think this is curriculum related and the other says it isn't. 
    Are we bound by that?

    Mr. Allen E. Daubman

    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    That's correct. 
    What the Equal Access Act does, as I mentioned earlier, is balance those three concerns. 
    It is very difficult for certainly this Court and much more certainly for school officials to determine on a case-by-case basis how close a relationship one needs for a particular club activity as it relates to one or more particular regular courses that are offered by the school. 
    What was done in this case, or what our practice had been at Westside High School for several years prior to the passage of the Equal Access Act, was to treat and run the co-curricular student clubs as part of the educational program of the school. 
    That is to be, I think, very clearly distinguished from the type of club activities which were permitted in Widmar v. Vincent. 
    Their access to school facilities for purposes of student meetings was allowed, but at no time did the university in that case exercise control over those student clubs and activities. 
    Our high school setting is much different.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="841.141" stopTime="887.805">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I think that the Federal statute prohibits that. 
    That... that's why I didn't understand your sponsor argument. 
    You're saying since... since the state requires a faculty sponsor for all these other groups, and since it can't provide the same kind of a faculty sponsor for these groups, perhaps because of establishment reasons, therefore it doesn't have to comply with the act. 
    But I don't... I think the act overrides your ability to simply say, every student group will have a faculty sponsor. 
    Where... why do you think you have a right to do that, any more than you have a right to say every student group shall have no more than 30 people? 
    The act wouldn't permit you to exclude a religious group that has 50 people on the basis that we don't have any student groups with more than 30 people, would it?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="887.805" stopTime="901.732">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    What the act does is provides a definitional framework for when you have a limited open forum triggering the applicability of that act, and it is our contention that we did not have a limited open forum under the terms of that act.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="901.732" stopTime="904.182">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why? 
    Because you had a... because you had sponsors?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="904.182" stopTime="933.017">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Primarily because we had... we did not have noncurriculum-related student groups. 
    The fact of a faculty sponsor and the control exercised by that sponsor, as well as the supervision of that sponsor and the answering to, by that sponsor, to the administration, I think clearly shows that we did not have a situation where simple access to building premises was allowed, but rather there was active sponsorship and involvement by the school district.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="933.017" stopTime="959.835">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's all it takes to make it faculty related, is that you have a sponsor on the faculty who directs the group, and the group can be engaged in any subject whatever. 
    I mean, pick whatever you want. 
    If you think chess is faculty related, I hesitate to suggest something that might not be. 
    But pick something that you think is and... and put a faculty sponsor in charge of it. 
    It would then be curriculum related?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="959.835" stopTime="982.767">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    What we are urging is that the definition of curriculum-relatedness really goes to the heart of what the school officials have chosen to do with the co-curricular activities. 
    They have chosen to treat that as part of their curricular offerings of the school, part of the educational program offered by the school. 
    The Equal Access Act I don't think goes that far. 
    I don't think it touches that far.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="982.767" stopTime="990.556">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, it would certainly... that would certainly... your construction would certainly enable any school district that felt like it to totally avoid the Equal Access Act.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="990.556" stopTime="995.425">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    I think that certainly that risk is present. 
    You have a situation--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="995.425" stopTime="996.860">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, do you think that's what Congress intended?
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="996.860" stopTime="1036.252">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --I think Congress intended... I know Congress intended that what ought to be done in terms of the school district's response to the Equal Access Act is to allow school districts in their discretion to make educational decisions as to what academic and co-curricular programs they're going to sponsor. 
    If a school district were to just blatantly say no, everything we do here is curriculum related, therefore the act doesn't apply, I think our trial courts are well able to see a sham when one exists. 
    Our trial court in this particular case spent a great deal of time exploring that issue, and there was a great deal of testimony regarding the curricular nature--

    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Well, and I think as pointed out in the briefs of the Respondent and the government, the dictionaries do it that way, too, but the testimony at trial, from the students' own expert witness, defines "curriculum" in the same manner that was defined by, or used by our administration, long before passage of the act.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1290.199" stopTime="1299.404">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, in your answer to Justice Stevens you indicated that the Democrat or Republican Club would be noncurriculum related because it's adversarial. 
    I don't see why that follows.

    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    No. 
    I'm... that isn't... if I said that, it isn't what I meant. 
    What... what we have is, if you have a... excuse me... if you have a club system... you know, co-curricular clubs that do have... that are noncurriculum related under the act, then certainly the governmental clubs that was... that were mentioned earlier would fall under the terms of the act, and they would have to be allowed as well. 
    In our school district we do not have adversarial clubs. 
    One of the things testified to at trial and, in practice, was in existence again long before the passage of the act is that adversarial clubs that advocate a particular point of view are not allowed in the school. 
    The school district did not... does not... lend its name to advocating a particular view. 
    Not that controversial subjects are shied away from, by any means. 
    It's just that they are dealt with--

    Now, if that were upheld, that wouldn't give way to any other noncurricular clubs, would it?

    May I ask you, in your brief I thought you endorsed the test that Congressman Goodling advocated, and he's quoted on page 70 and 71 of your brief. 
    You seem to have walked away from that.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, first there's a subject matter of the meeting of the type which a public school could sponsor. 
    Now, obviously it couldn't sponsor Republican points of view to the exclusion of other points of view, so that would take them out. 
    And the second test was... was does the school or school teacher require, or directly encourage, student participation in that activity, and obviously, again, a public school couldn't encourage people to vote Republican. 
    But that test would take care of this hypothetical, but you seem to have abandoned that. 
    Whereas, it would take care of things like the Chess Club and stuff that isn't very controversial. 
    It would draw a line between advocacy groups that would require you to open the door to other points of view and those that are obviously neutral and perfectly proper for a school to sponsor.

   Argument of Jay Alan Sekulow
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1494.195" stopTime="1501.350">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Daubman. 
    Mr. Sekulow?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1501.350" stopTime="1612.837">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The students of Westside High School who desire to form a student-initiated, student-led and voluntary Bible club do acknowledge that the school officials have important and oftentime delicate functions to perform with regard to the operation of schools under their control. 
    However, these concerns do not justify the prohibition of these students' Bible club from the Westside High School campus. 
    At issue at Westside High School, and what is before the court today is whether one or more noncurriculum-related clubs existed, which would then trigger Congress' Equal Access Act. 
    The Peer Advocates Club, which was discussed at trial, was an admission by the principal himself that that particular club was not related to any of the curriculum activities of Westside High School. 
    The pretrial stipulation that was discussed by the Petitioners' attorney related to ten clubs that were designated to be discussed. 
    However, and I think it's important to note that that same stipulation did not state that they would... that the Respondents would in any way not challenge other club activities. 
    The school officials themselves have set forth, if you will, the way in which to make the determination of whether a particular club is related to the curriculum. 
    And our test for whether the act would be triggered would be whether there is a direct relationship between the club and a core curriculum course or a curriculum course. 
    For instance, in defining the clubs, as it has in its... in the Joint Appendix there is a listing of the various student groups and student clubs that meet at Westside High School. 
    One of the clubs, Distributive Education Club, is listed by the schools as, in fact, an extension of the course in distributive education.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    Also, the act does not--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1671.825" stopTime="1683.466">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I know. 
    What you're saying is Congress wanted the schools to make the choice between clubs of this character and opening it up to things like sponsoring drugs and Ku Klux Klan and political advocacy and all that.

    No, not the use, just the... advocating change in the law to make it permissible.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1724.626" stopTime="1828.960">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --That would be covered by the act. 
    That would... that is the price... that's the price of freedom and what... in fact, one of the early cases involving the implementation of the Equal Access Act involved political speech: Student Coalition for Peace. 
    They wanted to form a group to discuss nuclear freezing, and they were denied access, and they, in fact, utilized the Equal Access Act, and the Third Circuit did, in fact, grant them equal access. 
    But what the act also does, and as the Petitioners have conceded today, we're not... and I think the act really does protect this... Congress did not ask the schools to surrender control to the facilities. 
    They did not say, if you will, open the door for the parade of horribles. 
    For instance, in 1969 this court in the Tinker decision allowed certain expressions of speech to take place on... on the high school campuses, and there's yet to be that real parade of horribles. 
    Now, Congress was concerned about groups going over the line, if you will, and what I mean by the line, it's advocating illegal activity and things like that. 
    And Congress was specific, number one, adopted the test that this court enunciated in Tinker in saying that any type of group or organization that would be materially disruptive or interfere with other students' right to learn would, in fact, not have to take place in the school. 
    Also, going further than what was really addressed in Tinker, and different as well, Congress sought to make sure that school administrators, as the Petitioners in fact have stated, would be entitled to protect the well-being of students under their control. 
    And I want to state here that the only club that has been denied access based on the content of the speech in this particular case has been the proposed Bible club which was to meet--

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    That they... yes. 
    Their position is that at Westside High School they desire... the rationale they gave was to present a balanced view, and that allowing this type of speech activity would not present a balanced view. 
    And therefore... I'm not trying to argue their position, obviously... that they would not have to allow a group that would advocate a position. 
    However, it's interesting that no particular group, no particular discussions took place with what exactly... prior to the denial, what exactly these students intended to do. 
    And what they wanted to do was read the Bible, pray and encourage one another with regard to the issues that they're going to face at Westside High School on a daily basis. 
    For instance, and as the Petitioners stated, the school is... does have controversial discussions on topics ranging from abortion to homosexuality to drug abuse. 
    But what they've really done is deny these students the right, even outside of the particular club forum here, to meet on a regular basis during lunch to discuss those concerns. 
    But under--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2095.848" stopTime="2100.218">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Where were these discussions held about, you know, abortion, homosexuality? 
    Is that in class?

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Some of them, yes. 
    Many times they were in class with a teacher present. 
    However, Planned Parenthood came in for an open module section, and sometimes, as the testimony stated, sometimes the teacher was there and sometimes the teacher wasn't. 
    And we're not saying that the school has to surrender its control of allowing controversial subjects to be discussed in class. 
    What we are saying is that these students in nature of 30 other clubs existing at Westside High School, many of which on their face are not related to the curriculum as they... really to take the position that anything that relates to the missions and goals is thereby curriculum related and, therefore, it does not trigger the act really does, as it was pointed out earlier, circumvent exactly what Congress was trying to prohibit.

    I do believe it does provide a barrier or a... a... a standard, if you will, because the clubs listed by the school in their listing of student organizations without even dealing with the Equal Access Act had no difficulty deciding which clubs were extensions of the curriculum and those that were not. 
    In a... for instance, as I stated earlier, the Distributive Education Class is listed as an extension of the distributive education course.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    Our position would be, Your Honor, that the best way to take a look at it was one of the examples that the Court addressed to the Petitioners in the... during their argument, and that is, what if there's no French class, but there is a French Club? 
    Here... especially, no form of French, or any type of foreign activities. 
    What Congress meant by curriculum related in that context, and why I do use the term, "directly related to curriculum" is, when you have the situation where you've got a French class and a French Club, or Latin class and a Latin Club, but you cannot... I think the line is easy to draw, Your Honor, or not impossible to draw, when you have a situation where the school administrators acknowledge and admit that a pure advocate club exists and they state on the record it does not relate to curriculum.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Yes, Your Honor, that that would be a part of the school's curriculum, that credit would be given.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Yes. 
    In that type of situation, I think then you have... that argument could be made. 
    What we have in this particular case is a whole listing of clubs that do not address the directly related, or even come close to it. 
    For instance, in addition to the Peer Advocates, which is acknowledged not to be related to curriculum by the principal himself, we have the Interact Club, which is an affiliate of Rotary International, and there isn't a view being espoused there, and that club... the school's only basis to tie that into curriculum related would be in fact whether there was an overall interest in the missions and goals of the particular school--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2464.805" stopTime="2480.398">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you're... the more you spell this out, the more it sounds like the court of appeals missed the boat. 
    I don't read anything like that in the court of appeals test.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2480.398" stopTime="2499.642">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Well, I think that the court of appeals response, Your Honor, was twofold. 
    Number one, that the definition of noncurriculum related that the district court approved and that the school utilized totally circumvents the act. 
    Now, there is not a great deal of discussion in the Eighth Circuit's opinion with regard to the various tests. 
    They did state that there was a Chess Club--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2499.642" stopTime="2500.642">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No, there isn't any. 
    There isn't any.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2500.642" stopTime="2511.800">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Well, they stated that the Chess Club, for instance, was not related to curriculum as well as other clubs, and they did not spell out what those other clubs were. 
    So that's clear, but as I was saying--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2511.800" stopTime="2528.626">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, suppose we arrive at some... which it sounds like we have to, or might, anyway, some definition of that "curriculum related". 
    Don't you think we ought to remand to see if the... have the court of appeals apply it, which it never did?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2528.626" stopTime="2639.031">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I think in the court of appeals' opinion they, in effect, applied more of the directly-related test because of their statements with regard to Chess Club and as it related to the logic situation in the district court. 
    For instance, the judge... Judge Beam stated that the Logic Club would... be a growth out of the Math Club, but there is no direct tie-in. 
    The Logic Club, for instance, doesn't even really function in that fashion, and I think what the district court... or the court of appeals was concerned with was the administrative deference that was being paid to the school officials in their interpretation of what, in fact, curriculum related meant. 
    That the Equal Access Act, if you will, becomes a nullity. 
    That anything that's related to missions and goals, which was the test that was decided by Judge Beam in the lower court. 
    And I think the Eighth Circuit specifically, albeit not as detailed as we would like, rejected that proposal by stating that the Chess Club, as well as other curriculum clubs, were in fact not related to curriculum and therefore the Equal Access Act would have applied. 
    And in the context of this particular forum, with the 30 other clubs there's a... and again, in the joint appendix, if we're looking for the test, the school officials had no trouble in doing... in implementing the test in this context. 
    Their own listing of clubs does state, for instance, that the Band Club is a part of the curriculum of band. 
    So these types of delineations are made all the times. 
    What we're saying is that educators and school officials should be given deference with regard to setting forth what their curriculum is, but if in fact they're going to allow student-initiated clubs, which this club does... the school does, that they, then, if a noncurriculum-related club does exist, they in fact have to open that forum up under the act.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2639.031" stopTime="2661.213">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Sekulow, but you would make this exception to your curriculum related... you would consider it to be part of the curriculum if the student... if the school is devoting a substantial amount of its resources specifically to running or directing the club? 
    For instance, if it doesn't have a music course but has a school band and pays a conductor of the school band?

    That there would have to be something during the curriculum where academic credit was given, supervision of a teacher and these types of things.

   Argument of Kenneth W. Starr

speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="2689.566" stopTime="2779.307">
    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In the view of the United States, careful study of this statute and of the record compiled by the Congress in the course of considering, of vigorously debating and enacting this measure, reveals two overriding concerns or values. 
    The value of fairness and evenhandedness, of equality, in the treatment of public secondary school students. 
    And the value of liberty, especially First Amendment the liberties assured to all of our citizens, those who are deeply religious and those who are not. 
    As one of the co-sponsors of this overwhelmingly bipartisan measure, Senator Leahy of Vermont put it, this bill makes an important statement about ideas. 
    It says that ideas are sacred to Americans, whether or not they concern religion. 
    It says that student-initiated religious groups have the same rights to meet on school property during noninstructional time as any other groups.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    Oh, I think the primary thrust was to protect religious liberty, because the problem that presented itself to Congress was one of discrimination that was visited on the heads of students who wanted to participate in religious discussion. 
    It is quite clear, it could not be clearer, that the purpose of this statute was to eliminate discrimination against students who were religious and who wanted to engage in religious discussion voluntarily. 
    I quite agree with that.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    The bill was originally drafted so as to provided protection only to religious groups. 
    There was concern that, by virtue of constitutional interpretations of this Court and other courts, the statute should speak neutrally, to include political, philosophical and other grounds. 
    I hasten to add, however, that Congress was quite clear with respect to the authority of schools to maintain order and discipline. 
    Subsection F of Section 4071 was inserted for the very purpose of achieving Tinker kinds of concerns with respect to disruption. 
    This measure was not only intended to eliminate discrimination, but it was intended to achieve a sensitive balancing, a sensitive balancing of rights, and what was recognized to be a very difficult and sensitive area for the country.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    I believe its authority derives under the spending powers of Article 1, Section 8, and also by virtue of the statement with respect to any number of members of the House and the Senate, its authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate discrimination.

    Well, it can't be the spending power, because there is no... no remedy of the cut off of funds here. 
    It has to be the latter, I think.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    Well, however, Justice Stevens, that the Congress saw fit to apply this statute only to schools that receive federal financial assistance, I suppose if we had a Grove City kind, as it were, of public school system that eschewed any federal funds, this would not apply. 
    Although I would think that under this Court's decisions under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, there might very well be power to reach that school [inaudible]. 
    But Congress saw fit not to exercise the entirety of its power in that respect. 
    The discussion has been not about Congress' purposes and intentions and motives at all, but rather with respect to the meaning of curriculum related. 
    There are three reasons why we would urge to the Court not to embrace the school district's open-ended approach. 
    We believe, first, that its approach is quite inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the word curriculum. 
    The word curriculum means the aggregate of courses... courses offered by the institution. 
    It was that common meaning, secondly, that one most readily discerns in reading the legislative history. 
    In particular, the description by Senator Hatfield, one of the co-sponsors of the Senate, who described curriculum-related clubs as those that are, in effect, extensions of the classroom. 
    And by the express admission at trial of the principal of Westside High School, Dr. Findley, Peer Advocates... it was discussed at trial; it was the subject of testimony at trial. 
    At page 277 of the trial transcript, Dr. Findley stated that Peer Advocates was not related to any course at Westside. 
    That, in our view, is sufficient to trigger the act. 
    Third, the school board's approach--

    --to the history of student activities in the United States. 
    There is considerable testimony at trial that student activities were in fact student initiated. 
    I'm not sure that football teams have that same history. 
    They may. 
    But the history of student activities is that students coming together in school wanted to pursue areas and activities of interest to the students; administrators were resistant to that. 
    And ultimately, in the fullness of time, school administrators began permitting students to pursue their interests just as Westside and other high schools across the country have seen fit to do here.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I gather if you... you say there has to be some connection with some particular part of the curriculum. 
    I suppose that would vary then from semester to semester as to whether the French Club was or wasn't within the act, or whether some of these other things would--
speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="3223.092" stopTime="3229.364">
    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    I don't believe that the course would have to be offered every single semester. 
    But it would have to relate to course work.

    Or every year?

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    It might not even have to be offered every year. 
    But it does seem to me, in light of Congress' use of the term curriculum and its discussion of any number of groups... the Chess Club, which does exist at Westside was considered the quintessential noncurriculum-related club, even though it obvious--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3249.092" stopTime="3254.980">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    With all due respect, I think the colloquy on the Chess Club was much more ambiguous than you portrayed it, between Senator Gorton and Senator Hatfield.
speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="3254.980" stopTime="3281.580">
    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    --Quite right. 
    Justice Stevens, I completely agree. 
    In fact, Senator Gorton conducted extremely skillful cross examination of Senator Hatfield. 
    It will be recalled that Senator Gorton thought that the act would be much clearer if you eliminated political and philosophical and made it quite clear that all you were trying to protect were religious groups by virtue of the discrimination that was being visited upon religious students. 
    I thank the Court. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Allen E. Daubman

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, General Starr. 
    Mr. Daubman, you have four minutes remaining.

    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    The test proposed by the Respondents and by the government is contrary to the act and is educationally unworkable. 
    To suggest that having students work with the handicapped at school, our regular ed students, so they can learn to be sensitive to the handicapped to characterize that as noncurriculum related, but to say that a football team, even in the absence of a physical education program at the high school is curriculum related creates unworkable and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3319.755" stopTime="3341.621">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I assume moral formation is part of your school... what the schools try to teach as well and... and I suppose religious groups are as closely related to moral formation as your... your helping the handicapped club is to sensitivity or whatever you... whatever value you said was being taught by that.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="3341.621" stopTime="3342.938">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    --That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3342.938" stopTime="3346.240">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So then if you allowed the one, you should have been allowing the other.
speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="3346.240" stopTime="3462.198">
    Mr. Allen E. Daubman 
    Again, the act isn't triggered unless we have noncurriculum related. 
    What the school has chosen to do is in structuring their co-curricular activities is those groups that advocate a particular point of view are not included in the curricular or co-curricular activities of the school. 
    And that was not the case with the club that was requested in this case. 
    Another example of the unworkability of the test advocated by the other side, Photography Club, which was identified as a suspect club in this case was alternatively taught. 
    Photography was, as a club or as a class, depending upon the availability of a state-certified teacher who could teach photography. 
    To suggest that we cannot have... that we create a limited open forum by having a photography club when a state-certified teacher is unavailable to teach it as a regular class I think presents an unworkable problem, a dilemma that school districts would not be able to work with. 
    Service clubs also indicated by the legislative history to perhaps in some circumstances be noncurriculum related. 
    In our school district the record is clear that service clubs in many of those... in the sociology class activities with service clubs could constitute... in some cases required over the years, in other cases could be used as extra credit in some of the sociology classes. 
    Again, to say that a particular type of club is noncurriculum related for all purposes I think really stifles the efforts of educators to deal with curriculum issues as they're constantly being called upon to do, in structuring a program that is relevant and provides educational benefit to its students. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
