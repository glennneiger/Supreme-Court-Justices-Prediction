    Justice Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the receipt of workman's compensation benefits under state law does not preempt actions under the Agricultural Workers Protection Act. 
    We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.
