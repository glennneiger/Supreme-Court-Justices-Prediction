    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 89-275, Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corporation. 
    Mr. Saltzburg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="54.301" stopTime="210.586">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Unlike the first case before you this morning, this one does not involve the Constitution. 
    It involves rules of procedure for civil cases in the United States district courts and the rules governing appeals in the United States courts of appeals. 
    And lawyers arguing about such rules face the unique task of arguing to you about what you probably meant, must have meant, when you considered rules submitted to you by the advisory committee, the standing committee, the judicial conference, and you approved them for submission to the Congress and they were in fact effective upon the completion of the rules enabling act process. 
    Although not rising to the level of constitutional issues, we submit that the three questions before you this morning may have an enormous impact on the availability of legal services to clients throughout this country who bring to lawyers every day cases and ask them to carry those cases to court and the lawyers are confronted with the responsibility of doing justice to the clients and meeting their duties to the court, particularly duties imposed now by the current state of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11. 
    The briefs of the parties in this case, as well as the briefs of the amici curiae, have addressed the facts at some length and I choose not to do that this morning unless the Court wishes. 
    I would like to spend a moment or two on the facts because they lay the groundwork for the three issues that I would like to address. 
    Briefly, the facts are as follows. 
    The litigation that resulted in sanctions began as a suit on a contract brought by a subsidiary of the Hartmarx Company against a client of Petitioner... Petitioner's law firm Cooter &amp; Gell. 
    This suit was met with a counterclaim, a Robinson-Patman counterclaim, and thus began the litigation that ended up in this Court with the sanctions issue. 
    As the investigation into the counterclaim took place and facts were gathered, Petitioner discovered what it believed to be serious antitrust violations, broad Robinson-Patman violations in a number of cities around the United States. 
    And allegations by its client, a clothing company, distributor of men's clothing that had done business at various locations since 1969 in Washington, D.C., that Hartmarx Company and two of its principle subsidiaries had engaged not only in Robinson-Patman violations, but it engaged in price fixing that was supported by an exclusive dealer arrangement.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is it clear that both the attorneys and the client here brought forth these allegations?
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="219.192" stopTime="242.391">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, what's clear is... is the following. 
    That the Petitioner represented to the district court that its investigation was based upon allegations made by its client. 
    And if I might elaborate, the... the... on that little bit because the record in this case is not the record that I would like to have before you, and I--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="242.391" stopTime="244.507">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But I take it it is the record you're going to deal with.
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="244.507" stopTime="428.410">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    --It is the record we must deal with and... and the reason for that is Rule 11 had just taken effect in its revised form in August of 1983. 
    The complaint in this case, the class action complaint which gave rise to sanctions, was filed barely three months thereafter and this was one of the early sanctions cases. 
    When the complaint was filed in this case, it was met with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and almost immediately thereafter a request for sanctions. 
    Almost immediately after the request for sanctions was filed, Mr. Chief Justice... gets to the point about who made the allegations... request was made by the defendant in the case to depose one of the principals, the leading shareholder and the president of the client company. 
    Petitioner opposed the deposition at that time, which was focused only on Rule 11, because the district court hadn't addressed the 12(b)(6) motion, hadn't considered the merits, and enormous clients... enormous questions of attorney/client privilege and the difficulty of dealing with privilege questions and Rule 11 issues at a time when this case was in its infancy and there was the previously filed Robinson-Patman claim pending. 
    And they opposed the deposition and the district court ordered that the deposition take place. 
    And it did. 
    During the course of that deposition, which is in the Joint Appendix before this Court, this Court can see that counsel essentially instructed its... the principal of its client not to answer any questions with respect to what the client said to the law firm. 
    Instead, Petitioner offered to make available any member or the law firm to explain the origins of the complaint, the information that was relied upon, anything else, without waiving the attorney/client privilege. 
    Well, if I might jump ahead in the law for a moment, if we had the benefit of all the cases, if we had... had had in 1984... in 1983 the benefit of all the cases decided in the next four or five years, one could say, well, didn't they know that procedures would be developed whereby in camera you could go before the district court and make certain representations that wouldn't be disclosed, that there wouldn't be a waiver of privilege. 
    And there are ways to deal with attorney/client privilege problems that might have enabled the deposition to take place, information to be provided to the judge, without waiver of the privilege and the answer is yes. 
    With the benefit of what came afterwards, it might have been possible to do things differently. 
    But this was early 1984. 
    It was early in Rule 11. 
    And, in fact, the record indicates that the client basically said, I relied on the law firm and was instructed not to answer any questions about what the client in fact told the law firm. 
    The Petitioner represented to the district court and represented to the court of appeals, and represents to this Court, that its investigation was at all times based upon the information and belief provided by this experienced client, a client that had been in the men's clothing business for 14 years prior to the filing of the complaint, that it had experience in the industry and that one of the difficulties with this record was the difficulty of dealing with attorney/client privilege questions and an early sanctions motion... early in the case... before the merits were even to be addressed.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    We don't have before us, do we, the question of whether it was appropriate for the district court to impose sanctions?
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="434.480" stopTime="475.891">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    No, sir. 
    The... the issue before the Court is whether... you don't have before you the question of the amount of sanctions or whether the district court abused its discretion. 
    The Court denied review of both those questions. 
    It did grant review on the issue of what the standard of review should be, whether it should be a clearly erroneous standard and, to some extent, the propriety of imposing sanctions would, of course, depend on the scope of review that the appellate court should have used. 
    If the Court decides that a higher standard should have been used than the court of appeals, the Court would, under the question granted, be justified in remanding this case for further consideration by the court of appeals on whether--

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    --Justice O'Connor, I think that's a very fair conclusion. 
    Without criticizing the court of appeals in any way, I think the fairest statement that one can make is that it's very difficult to tell from the opinion of the court of appeals exactly what standard it used. 
    There are prior opinions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which would bind that panel, unless the court were to go on en banc and of course overrule the prior decisions which suggest that an abuse of discretion standard was used in the circuit.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Justice O'Connor, to give a full answer to that, I want to be clear. 
    Our position is that with respect to criminal contempt, 18 U.S.C. 401, as well as 28 U.S.C. 1927, the penalty provision for lawyers who vexatiously multiply proceedings, that the court's power to impose and to consider contempt and penalties on the lawyer under that statute are not... are not ended when a Rule 41(a)(i) dismissal is filed. 
    And the reason is that the Congress has provided by statute for very particularized sanctions for the most egregious forms of behavior and that prior to the amendment in 1983 of Rule 11 there was no indication that contempt or other sanctions for misbehavior, particular affront to the court, couldn't be considered. 
    What we have today, and the reason this case we submit is different than the issues presented from those statutory provisions, particularly contempt, is that we have your rules. 
    We have your Rule 11, your Rule 41, and a construction of those rules and what you intended. 
    And your rules provide two exceptions to Rule 41... 41(a)(1). 
    They provide that that rule will be subject to 23(e), the class action rule which requires the judge consider notice to the class before the dismissal becomes final, and 66, the receiver's rule. 
    No one suggested when... in 1983 when the rule was amended, that there ought to be an additional exception for Rule 11. 
    Now, this is also different--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="704.105" stopTime="723.667">
    Justice O'Connor 
    Well, I don't see why you need an exception. 
    Rule 11, just like contempt proceedings, is addressed to something else and the language is there, and I fail to understand why a dismissal under Rule 41 should have any effect on a sanction motion against the lawyer.

    In this case, both the attorney and the client were sanctioned.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, let me perhaps answer that in two... two ways. 
    The arguments that Respondents make to the Court... now, the Court, of course, can accept less of this argument... the arguments that Respondents make is that indeed Rule 11 does give the federal district court the power to dismiss the case with prejudice as a sanction, notwithstanding Rule 41 saying dismissal will be without prejudice. 
    They are... and they are in effect forced to that position because all of the cases decided in the lower court say that the district judge has essentially a whole array of sanctions, whatever the district judge deems appropriate. 
    And their argument is that that is... you can square that reading of Rule 11 with Rule 41 by simply saying that the with prejudice is a penalty imposed because of a Rule 11 violation and that somehow that doesn't interfere with Rule 41's guarantee to the client that dismissal would be without prejudice.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    --It would be. 
    It would be, in fact, in our judgment, required as a fair construction of the two rules at a minimum. 
    But beyond that, and this goes back to the question that the Chief Justice put about what the effect would be of a... of a dismissal. 
    One of the things that Rule 11 does, at least if our argument is accepted and the law, at least as it's developing now, is that there are at least minimum procedural requirements that must be employed before any sanctions are imposed. 
    One of those requirements is, at least in some instances where the sanction is severe, that there be fact-finding by the court. 
    And those facts may very well give rise to collateral estoppel fact unless there is an appeal and unless the appeal is... produces a... an overturning of the lower court's decision. 
    What happens on Rule 11 is there are no sanctions in the abstract. 
    There are sanctions because the district judge makes a decision that something was wrong. 
    And if the district judge decides that something was wrong has to do with the merits of the case, we now have a situation in which 41 says you can dismiss without prejudice, but Rule 11's dismissal may in fact be, as a practical matter, prejudicial not only in the sense of economically prejudicial but prejudicial in the very legal sense of making it more difficult, if not impossible, to bring a subsequent suite based on those same facts.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    To the extent that the difficult but not impossible involved fact-finding and collateral estoppel that might make the second action if not wholly barred... I mean, it may make the second action precluded at least in part.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="971.279" stopTime="979.069">

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    I think that it is a... that the with prejudice language, or without prejudice, means without having any preclusive effects upon a subsequent suit. 
    And in the case of Rule 11, there are two possibilities, Justice Scalia, as you say. 
    One is the Court could say that you simply cannot dismiss with prejudice totally so that the complaint therefore, at least in theory, could be refiled. 
    But the other problem in Rule 11 sanctions is, to the extent that there are findings which may have preclusive effect either because they are imposed, as in this case, directly against the client as well as the law firm, or because they're imposed against the law firm and the law firm and client are in privity.

    It's the fact-finding, as you I think indicated in your question, that has the possibility of preclusive effects and--

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    He may also be sanctioned... and this is a problem with the construction of Rule 11 that allows sanctions to be imposed after a dismissal... that it may also be the case that the judge will say facts A, B and C are untrue. 
    Now, Justice Scalia may be correct. 
    He didn't have to say that. 
    And we could make an argument perhaps down the line in some court that a judge who so found was going beyond what that judge had to do, that he should have focused simply on the theoretical, did the lawyer investigate. 
    But there's no guarantee that argument in fact will win and that it won't be a preclusive effect. 
    The other thing, if I might say, about... Mrs. O'Connor, back to the question you asked... about the Court's construction, why this is different from contempt, is that if the Court decides that Rule 11 sanctions may be imposed after a voluntary dismissal, the Court essentially is... is saying, because the rule allows that they can be imposed sua sponte, any time without time limits. 
    The time limits this Court has provided in its rules for various things... for example, to reopen a judgment... would have no force in effect. 
    When this Court looked at the attorney's fees question when an application for attorney's fees under statute ought to be... ought to have to be filed, the Court struggled with whether that 59(3) time limit, the 10-day time limit should apply, and it ended up saying no because this was a statutory creature. 
    But this is a rule creature and the... it is... it is the case which... that if the Court decides that Rule 11 sanctions remain available forever, that no time limit otherwise provided in the law has any force and effect. 
    Now, that might sound like a theoretical problem, except this case demonstrates how real it is. 
    In this case, almost four years went by between the time that the sanctions motion was filed, the voluntary dismissal took place. 
    And suddenly, at the conclusion of a wholly unrelated case, the district court judge said, well, the time is now right to consider the old Rule 11.

    I don't... Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know of a time limit on contempt sanctions. 
    The... there are other procedural protections, and criminal contempt, of course, being the criminal sanctions, has the Speedy Trial Act provisions that would... that would apply.

    How about civil contempt?

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Civil contempt is... is, to the best of my knowledge, no... I don't know of any sanctions. 
    But usually it's a contempt power that's invoked during a case to produce certain forms of behavior, and when the case is over rarely invoked thereafter. 
    I can't think of a case where it's invoked after the end of the case. 
    Now, if I might... I mean, I certainly realize that it's... it's an unpopular position to stand here before this Court to say that if a lawyer... if a lawyer were to file a plainly inadequate complaint and then move to dismiss the complaint under Rule 41, that somehow the lawyer should escape. 
    That offends almost everyone's basic sense of what seems right, at least at the outset. 
    But there is no Rule 11 case... there's no Rule 11 case that doesn't raise this question, which is how are we going to know whether or not there was an inadequacy unless we start the procedural machine rolling to make the Rule 11 determinations? 
    And our submission is Rule 41 has always served a very valid and important purpose. 
    It allows people to walk away. 
    And in this case, to walk away before there's any expense. 
    In this case if there's one fact that I hope will be significant to this Court, it is this one. 
    That before this complaint was filed... before this complaint was filed, after the clients made their allegation to Petitioner, this Petitioner gave a copy of the complaint to the general counsel for Hartmarx, the parent company. 
    It gave a copy of the complaint to counsel who are before you and gave then all the time they wanted to examine the complaint and to talk about it before it was filed. 
    And these lawyers said, go ahead, file your complaint. 
    The complaint was filed. 
    No one suggested that the facts... and in this case it was only one set of facts that mattered, namely, there was price-fixing going on... price-fixing bolstered by an exclusive dealership. 
    Rather than say, hey, you've got this wrong, we can help you with it, don't file it... rather than that, they waited. 
    The moment the complaint was--

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    --Justice Scalia, I'm glad you put the question that way because I'd like to give you as direct an answer as that question is. 
    That is exactly our argument. 
    And the... I'd say this... this to the Court about this entire case. 
    You have Rule 41, you've got Rule 11, and you have the lawyers arguing to you both as amicus and as parties in this case. 
    You've got them arguing that what we're trying to do is to deal with the system that is designed to provide speedy, fair justice for all the parties. 
    Now, one way to do that is to take Rule 11 and to say what Rule 11 does is it imposes some obligation on Plaintiffs, who have no coercive power to force facts from defendants at all, and to say to them, you take your chances. 
    And to defendants, play cat and mouse, hold back the facts, run and use Rule 11 as a club.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Well, in this case I would like to remind the Court, Justice Scalia, there has been no determination at all as to whether the facts alleged by the clients of petitioner are true. 
    We never reached that issue.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    --I don't believe... I don't think that that's a fair characterization, Justice Rehnquist. 
    There is a reference to a Washington Post article, suggestions by Respondents that there was publicity in this case. 
    But I think a fair statement of what happened in this case is that the Petitioner, before it filed the complaint, was trying to talk about it and use the litigation when it was apparent that there was going to be no discussion.

    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    That's correct, Justice Kennedy. 
    The... the... it was a follow-up to a Robinson-Patman Act complaint which was filed as a counterclaim, probably a compulsory counterclaim under the rules. 
    And it was an attempt to say to the defendants in that case that we think we have a bigger antitrust problem here. 
    We're going to file a separate case. 
    We think we've got facts unless you tell us otherwise.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1597.538" stopTime="1614.966">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You say when a Plaintiff files a claim for $500,000 damages as a result of an accident and he says to the other side, I think we have a tort problem here... I mean, that isn't what most people think the filing of a complaint is, kind of a starting of a discussion.
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="1614.966" stopTime="1738.797">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    No one has suggested that the... that a filing of a complaint is the beginning of the discussion. 
    In this case, the complaint was drafted after there had been extensive discovery in the... with respect to Robinson-Patman that led to the belief that there were broader antitrust violations. 
    And the Court has a choice, and the lower courts have a choice when they get into the standard of review. 
    And the choice is quite clear. 
    The choice is do you want litigants to avoid litigation where they can? 
    Do you want them to share information short of having to invoke the compulsory process, or do you want them to run into court and make Rule 11 motions? 
    If this Court said nothing else other than, the lower courts ought to be clear that there's a duty to mitigate. 
    But you can't come in and invoke Rule 11. 
    You can't do it if you've had a chance to avoid all the damages and you chose not to take that chance. 
    There would be no better principle for reducing the cost of litigation and making it a more civilized place in which to try cases. 
    There are lots of lawyers out there, whether they're plaintiff's employment lawyers who've filed an amicus brief... lots of lawyers. 
    Now, if they can't get all the facts... they have allegations, they do... they make efforts to corroborate, and when they do, they have to decide what to do next. 
    And what to do next may be to run into court and take your chances on Rule 11 or to say to the defendants, here's what we think we have. 
    Now, Mr. Chief Justice, no one is suggesting that the defendant should be obligated to go through every line of a complaint and to review it for all the law and all the little... you know, intricacies. 
    But where it's one essential fact and they're saying, we think this is what we've found out... if they think there's something wrong, they ought to say it. 
    In the court of appeals they said they had an 800 number... never mentioned in the district court, never mentioned it in this Court in any of the papers... which they said that the Plaintiffs could have called to find out where these distributors were. 
    Well, that 800 number was never mentioned. 
    If it's easy to avoid litigation, this Court ought to say to the courts of appeals: mitigation is an important part of Rule 11. 
    Some of the lower courts have said that. 
    That, we submit, is at the heart of what the scope of appellate review here ought to be. 
    I have almost no time left, but I hope I might reserve the minute or so that's left for rebuttal.

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I believe the Court has put its finger on some of the issues that are of concern and importance here today. 
    But in light of Mr. Saltzburg's comments about significant facts, with the Court's indulgence, I'd just like to review a few of the items that he made... he made some allusion to.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Please do it, Mr. Favretto, with a mind to the three questions before the Court, will you?

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I... I... I accept and I agree with your observation that the propriety of the award below... the propriety of the Rule 11 decision below is not before this Court. 
    Indeed, this Court rejected review of that issue on Question 4. 
    But Mr. Saltzburg has folded these issues into his... the standard of review question perhaps before this Court, and I'd just like to briefly get... get at the point... get at the point in response. 
    These arguments about presenting us with a copy of the complaint before filing the complaint were presented to the district court, were debated during argument and were referred to in affidavits filed by Petitioner's senior partner before the district court. 
    The district court concluded that they never asked us for our view of the facts, that if they had asked us, they wouldn't have believed us, and the whole approach was made in the context of trying to leverage a settlement of the existing litigation as well as paying them more money for these... for these offenses. 
    We submit in that context that is hardly... hardly... the kind of practice that this Court wants to encourage by endorsing a system where litigants talk to one another before... before filing a case.

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    --Okay. 
    With respect to relying on the... relying on their client, I would just direct the Court's attention to pages 34 and 35 of the Joint Appendix where when I asked the client about the key allegation in the complaint and asked him what he knew, what independent basis he had for that information, Mr. Cooter interrupted me and asked his client, 
    "Did you know anything other than what we told you? " 
    The answer: "No". 
    Mr. Cooter, 
    "He trusts us, as well he should. " 
    "Obviously Mr. Dashtara, the client, didn't make the investigation. " 
    "We did and now it's crystalline. " 
    The attempt to shift the blame or shift some of the blame to an absent client before this Court and also before the court of appeals is... is not... does not square with the record. 
    The Court considered that question, made findings in the district court on it, and I think the record that we have before us has to form the basis for this Court's... for this Court's assessment of the issues before it. 
    Moving to the... the merits of the issues before the Court, we believe that Petitioner's contention essentially amounts to an argument on the voluntary dismissal point that no matter how egregious the conduct, no matter how much burden or pain that the... that the lawyer imposes on the system, Rule 41... the voluntary dismissal aspect of Rule 41 is an absolutely escape hatch from Rule 11 sanctions. 
    This cannot be correct. 
    To state the principle is to refute it. 
    The rules do not conflict. 
    Nothing in the wording of the rules makes them conflict with one another necessarily. 
    The rules serve different purposes, as Justice O'Connor observed, and Rule 11 is a sanctioning provision which protects independent court interests and it is an authority which the district courts must retain beyond their authority to rule on the merits of the claim.

speaker="richard_joseph_favretto" startTime="2046.447" stopTime="2153.467">
    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    Well, Justice O'Connor, let me just respond by giving you a little background about what happened here and then responding to your question. 
    First, there was a series of litigation, related litigation between the parties here... various subsidiaries and the Petitioner's client, various subsidiaries of my client and the Petitioner's client. 
    The litigation was not finally resolved until July of 1986. 
    The Advisory Committee notes expect that... suggest that Rule 11 sanctions should be imposed at the end of the litigation. 
    Well, the litigation didn't end until July of '86. 
    Within two or three months thereafter, Mr. Cooter, Petitioner's senior counsel, appeared before Judge Gasch in another completely unrelated case, the Kuwait Airlines v. American Security case that's referred to in the Petitioner's brief. 
    When that case was completed in the district court, as Petitioner has noted, Judge Gasch called the motion up for... for a decision. 
    It could have been complete... it's completely equally plausible, is our submission, that the... we could speculate that Judge Gasch was essentially giving the Petitioner and its senior partner consideration in not ruling on the Rule 11 motion that was pending before him in our litigation while Mr. Cooter was before him in a... in a completely separate case. 
    Now, that's equally plausible speculation, I say, but it's speculation and, in any event, it doesn't have a jurisdictional foundation. 
    It doesn't stop the district court from... from finally acting when it... when it did act. 
    But it seems clear to us that Rule 41 cannot preempt or give a... a lawyer an absolute immunity bath for anything he does before the dismissal of the complaint. 
    And... and... and the facts of this case--

    I think Rule 11 was clearly intended to allow the district courts to deal with the problem.

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    --I accept your... your modification. 
    But this case is a good example of why that can't be the rule. 
    The violation occurred with the filing, the harm attached, the publicity attached. 
    And we invoked a rule. 
    We filed our motions. 
    The affidavits were filed. 
    Everything was done. 
    Indeed, the hearing on the motion occurred even before the voluntarily dismissal was perfected because this voluntary dismissal required a waiver of the notice to the punitive class members. 
    So, the only unfairness in that scenario would be to the system and to... and to the victim of the... of the misconduct in this case. 
    On the standard of review, we believe that the Petitioners got what they asked for below. 
    They got a fresh look. 
    There is nothing in the court of appeals' opinion that suggests deference to the district court on the question of liability, Rule 11 liability. 
    Indeed, the court of appeals simply looked at their own affidavits and said those affidavits do nothing more than confirm the fact of a Rule 11 violation. 
    It was impossible to conclude, in the words of the court of appeals, how no inquiry could be sufficient inquiry or reasonable inquiry, and how an inquiry with respect to four proximate markets could support an allegation with respect to misconduct nationwide in all major metropolitan areas.

 See, what I'm concerned about is that... as I read your brief, that your abuse of discretion standard might not require any factual findings. 
 It's just sort of a general statement of a conclusion about the overall problem. 
 Whereas if you would agree that the judge at least had a duty to make some specific factual findings that were the predicate for the action, then I don't see how you could escape the fact that the standard of review of those facts would be clearly erroneous.

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    --I... I would... I would... I would think that a... that a district court should be... should be required to state the reasons, the factual basis, whether they are disputed or undisputed. 
    And if they are disputed, perhaps a clearly erroneous standard could be applied on review to his judgment about where the facts come out. 
    But I think if a court of appeals saw a record or a decision that didn't allow it to understand what the basis for the district court's judgment was, then that would be of itself an abuse of discretion and it would send the case back for a clearer statement of the factual underpinnings of the... of the holding.

    Well, if one were to compare different standards of review and if you were to say clearly erroneous on facts and de novo on law, as opposed to just abusive discussion generally, certainly the abusive discussion standard would spawn less litigation over this subject than this trifurcated type of thing, wouldn't it?

    And it... it's... oh, and abusive... not reviewing under an abusive discretion standard is also completely inconsistent with the purposes of the 1983 amendments. 
    As I... as I have read the background of the... of the amendments, and the Advisory Committee notes, the whole purpose here was to kind of invest district courts with stronger sanctioning authority and with the weapons necessary, if you will, to administer the practice of attorneys before those courts. 
    And to... to give them the flexibility necessary to deal with a variety of factual situations, but yet applying an... a... an objective standard of reasonableness under the circumstances.

    Mr. Richard Joseph Favretto 
    --Oh, yeah. 
    I'm about... I'm about to move on to that, Justice Scalia. 
    The Petitioner's position on appellate fees is simply that the district court cannot... cannot... include in its sanction the costs of successfully defending a Rule 11 award on appeal. 
    Their view, more elaborated, is that this represents a kind of punishment for taking a non-frivolous appeal, and only Rule 38 of the appellate rules governs conduct on appeal. 
    Our position is that that argument misses the point. 
    This is not a matter of punishing anyone for conduct on the appeal. 
    This is simply an exercise of delineating the proper scope of the sanctions attaching to misconduct in a district court. 
    The violation occurs in the district court, but the injury lingers on. 
    Injury caused by the district court misconduct is simply not limited to what happens to an adversary in the district court. 
    Therefore, the sanction should not... should similarly not be limited.

 But they say you... you charged too much for your time or you put in your time from the time they showed you the complaint to the time they filed, or something like that, which shouldn't have been done. 
 So we cut that out. 
 But then you'd compensate for it by getting a little more for having been required to defend an appeal. 
 You'd end up a net winner.

   Rebuttal of Stephen Allan Saltzburg
speaker="stephen_allan_saltzburg" startTime="3484.195" stopTime="3540.564">
    Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg 
    Mr. Chief Justice: 
    We believe Rule 38 of the appellate rules and Section 1912 of 28 U.S.C. govern the recovery of fees, including attorney's fees on appeal, and they are the exclusive rules. 
    Nothing the advisory committee notes on Rule 11 indicates that it was intended to be a fee-shifting statute or rule for appeal. 
    With respect to the tripartite analysis that we urge upon you in terms of scope of review, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, it's likely to produce more appeals. 
    It's likely to produce more careful appellate review, it's like to have lawyers coming up to the courts of appeals more often. 
    It's what this case is about. 
    It really is about where the lawyer is hamstrung with questions of attorney/client privilege back at a time where they didn't know how to deal with that question and put forth all the facts before the district court... whether they're entitled to careful findings, the most careful kinds of scrutiny before the district judge rules, and whether before their reputations are impugned they're entitled to careful appellate review. 
    We submit that they are. 
    Thank you.
