    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 89-645, Michael Milkovich v. the Lorain Journal Company. 
    Mr. English, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The sole question before the Court this morning with respect to this case is whether false and defamatory statements published about the petitioner by the respondents are entitled to constitutional protection under the First Amendment. 
    This Court has repeatedly stated that there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. 
    Yet the Ohio courts below have afforded exactly that protection in this case. 
    This Court has the opportunity to correct that error and to delineate finally how the opinion/fact distinction should be made in the context of defamation law.

    Your Honor, these statements are quite capable of being proven false. 
    There are actually four statements unequivocally that could be proven false. 
    As the Supreme Court of Ohio in the Milkovich decision in late 1984 held, the primary impact of this article is to accuse the petitioner of committing the crime of perjury. 
    The proceeding at which the alleged perjury occurred was of records, stenographically recorded, and clearly the testimony at that proceeding could easily be compared with the statements that Mr. Milkovich had made previously as to the same question. 
    And thus, a reasonable jury could determine whether or not the statements in fact were false or whether they were true.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    Your Honor, I would say that that is a fundamental aspect of the question of opinion. 
    If something cannot be proved true or false, I would suggest to the Court that it could be properly labeled as opinion. 
    However, as Justice O'Connor has just mentioned, it may not be necessary in this area of the law to even adopt any kind of opinion privilege if we require a defamation plaintiff to affirmatively prove falsity. 
    But in this case, the allegation is that Mr. Milkovich lied under oath in a judicial proceeding. 
    That is quintessentially an assertion of fact which, if false, should be actionable under the state law of defamation. 
    However, certain statements, which are very rhetorical or hyperbolic or polemical, which cannot be proved true or false, could easily be characterized as opinion. 
    However, it is the petitioner's judgement that this Court need not reach that question in this case, since based on the Hepps case, Mr. Milkovich can demonstrate his entitlement to at least a jury determination on the question of whether or not this... these statements were true or false, and unquestionably they were defamatory. 
    Your Honors, as I have pointed out in my brief, there are many instances in the past twenty years, after this Court's decision in Gertz v. Robert Welch, were courts have presumed that there is a broad First Amendment based privilege in the law of defamation. 
    As a result of that presumption, and this Court has never so held, there have been many courts that have developed a series of different formulations as to how that distinction should be made, whether something is an assertion of fact or whether something is a expression of opinion. 
    Most courts have relied first on the question of whether or not a statement is objectively verifiable. 
    And as I have pointed out in this instance, this statement is unequivocally objectively verifiable. 
    This is not a situation like, for example, the case Buckley v. Littell decided by the Second Circuit where there was a statement that William F. Buckley was a, quote, "fellow fascist traveler". 
    In that case, the Second Circuit looked at that language and said there is no way that that statement can be in fact verifiable. 
    It is loosely defined words. 
    It is polemical, it is political in nature. 
    And as a result, that statement is not defamatory, or even if defamatory, is not actionable. 
    However, in the same case, Mr. Buckley was also accused to having committed plagiarism. 
    And the Second Circuit analyzed that question and said that, very much like perjury or an allegation of perjury, is definitely empirically provable, clearly is defamatory, and therefore should be actionable. 
    So the Second Circuit has certainly recognized that there is an opinion privilege, but that opinion privilege only applies in the area where there is very polemical language, hyperbolae being utilized, and where in context the statement cannot be objectively verified. 
    In this case, Your Honors, the respondents have contended that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide this case on the grounds that the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that there is an opinion privilege under the Ohio constitution. 
    They cite the case of Michigan v. Long, decided by this Court in 1983, for that proposition. 
    I would like to address that question directly because I think it's important in the context. 
    The procedural history of this case is somewhat unique. 
    It has had 15 years of litigation in Ohio's courts. 
    There have been three attempts to bring this case to the attention of the United States Supreme Court, the latest and presumably only successful one, being the one sought be the petitioner. 
    In Michigan v. Long this Court held that where a state court has unequivocally determined an issue on separate adequate and independent state grounds, this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the question. 
    However, in this case, the decision from which the appeal is taken is from the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Appellate District, and not from the Ohio Supreme Court. 
    And the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals from the Eleventh Appellate District relies nearly exclusively on Federal precedent and also relies on the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in the accompanying Scott case. 
    As the Court is aware, the Ohio Supreme Court in... in a period of yet... just 15 months has determined, on one hand, that the statements in question in this case are constitutionally protected as opinion under the First Amendment, and then 15 months later determined that the very same statements under the very same facts, but with a different plaintiff, are in fact constitutionally protected or immunized by the First Amendment. 
    The Ohio Supreme Court did in fact mention on two occasions in its... in its decision that it was relying in part on the Ohio constitution. 
    However, any fair reading of the Scott case clearly indicates that the Ohio Supreme Court was primarily relying on this Court's decision on Gertz against Robert Welch, decided in 1974, and the veritable flood of cases that have been decided since, presuming that there is this broad First Amendment-based privilege. 
    Therefore--

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    --They are... they are pre-New York Times v. Sullivan, basically standing for the proposition that the Ohio constitution means essentially the same thing as the First Amendment with respect to freedom of the press. 
    The two provisions are roughly the same, alchough, ironically enough, the Ohio constitution expressly recognizes that there shall be free speech subject to the right of protection of your reputational interest if you are defamed. 
    Whereas, obviously, the First Amendment says nothing about the state law of defamation. 
    The Ohio Supreme Court in this case... in the Scott case, merely relied in part on the Ohio constitution, saying that it was a separate source of authority but quite clearly under the analysis provided in Michigan v. Long, which is frankly a very analogous to this one, this Court has jurisdiction to decide the question. 
    There are no Ohio cases known to the petitioner that specifically hold that the first... that the section of the Ohio constitution, Article I, Section 11, provides more protection for freedom of the press than does the First Amendment to the Constitution.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    There is... I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
    That is a statement, and then there is a statement in Justice Locher's opinion for the court that says that the Court is relying on the Ohio constitution as well as the Federal Constitution. 
    There is no question that the Federal constitutional provision is very much interwoven with the Ohio constitutional provision. 
    And thus, it's certainly Petitioner's view that this Court has jurisdiction to decide the scope of, or even the applicability of a First Amendment-based privilege. 
    Your Honors, if this Court adopts a First Amendment-based opinion privilege, the Petitioner would ask the Court to establish that privilege in a very narrow manner and look to two primary objective factors, as opposed to subjective factors on which the Ohio Supreme Court relied in--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="653.376" stopTime="663.832">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Is this... is this is... is this your primary submission, Mr. English, or is your primary submission that there really is no... no need for a separate First Amendment privilege for opinion?
speaker="brent_lawson_english" startTime="663.832" stopTime="699.005">
    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    --Your Honor, I would say that under the Hepps case, after the... after the Hepps was decided there is no need for a First Amendment-based privilege, period. 
    However, if the Court acknowledges that a First Amendment-based privilege is necessary in this area, primarily because of the breathing space requirement that the Court has recognized ever since New York Times v. Sullivan, then that privilege should be very narrowly drawn, and it should be objective factors. 
    Certainly one objective factor is whether or not the statement is objectively verifiable, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, and certainly which is now a requirement, constitutional requirement, based on the Hepps case. 
    I would suggest--

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    --Your Honor, that... that is the position that I have advanced in the brief, and I believe that that would adequately protect the competing interest at stake. 
    This Court has long recognized that there's a... there's certainly need for a vigorous robust free press. 
    But, however, there is also a need for an individual to be able to recover for reputational damage. 
    And in this case, Mr. Milkovich has been attempting to do so for 15 years and has virtually every constitutional impediment put in his way, and now we have the Supreme Court of Ohio making a decision that on the basis that... of essentially misconstruing this Article and the specific allocations in it, that this is somehow constitutionally protected opinion. 
    You need only look at the article to determine what in fact they alleged. 
    The headline is Maple Beat the Law with the "Big Lie". 
    On the inside Diadiun says, "Maple told a lie". 
    Specifically, and I quote, 
    "Anyone who attended the meet, whether he be from Maple Heights, Mentor, or impartial observer. " 
    those are the schools involved, 
    "knows in his heart that Milkovich and Scott lied at the hearing after each having given his solemn oath to tell the truth. " 
    This is, Your Honors, quintessentially an assertion of fact which, if false, is the proper subject for a defamation claim.

    Mr. Richard D. Panza 
    I'd like to address myself now to Justice O'Connor's comments concerning why Respondent believes that Hepps in no way is sufficient to protect opinion if the purpose of the protected speech is to advance public debate. 
    And I believe what Mr. English has been talking about for 15 minutes is... is a test known as the verifiability test. 
    The problem with the verifiability test and because, of course, we know Hepps doesn't direct us to any test whatsoever... I'm not sure it was intended to do that... but implicitly, by shifting the burden to the plaintiff, it necessitates the verifiability test. 
    The problem with the verifiability test is that it protects only speech which is figurative and so hyperbolic that it is absolutely false. 
    This is speech which does very little to advance public debate. 
    The problem with the verifiability test is that it tends to eliminate as... it tends to eliminate the vast body of opinion that may be based on certain facts, which may or may not be... be proven true. 
    It is that... that debate, it is that opinion, such as the opinion in this case, that advances public debate. 
    By allowing Hepps to stand without any other constitutional protection you are in effect excluding a substantial amount of opinion.

    Not at all. 
    I believe what is or is not opinion has to be analyzed by the context of what was said, not by two or three or maybe four facts in the statement upon which the context is based. 
    By the entire context. 
    I think the restatement of tort second solves the problem of saying I think, and then going through a recitation of facts. 
    And I don't... and I am not up here asking the Court to... to agree that merely by putting some mystical words "I think" and then reciting objective fact you can protect all that fact. 
    Absolutely not.

    If you will... I'm... thank you, Your Honor. 
    If you allow a jury to decide that question, you will be promoting self-censorship and not public debate. 
    If, in fact, newspapers will be left to the uncertainty of jury conclusions in regards to an analysis of whether or not their opinion may contain certain facts which can or cannot be proven true or false out of context, they won't write the opinion.

    And how... how does the court go about deciding that?
speaker="richard_d_panza" startTime="1771.238" stopTime="1828.658">
    Mr. Richard D. Panza 
    Well, it has to use a test and it has to adopt a test. 
    And there are many tests that we set forth in our brief. 
    The one we are a proponent of is pretty much the test used in the Scott Court in 1986. 
    And that is, the Ollman test, as modified by the Seventh Circuit in the Potomac Valve case. 
    It takes into consideration the meaning of the words, it takes into consideration whether or not the particular factual assertion is verifiable, if it is a factual assertion. 
    It takes into consideration the internal and external context of the entire opinion. 
    And the entire opinion is important here, Your Honor, because the speaker, Diadiun, never said Mike Milkovich committed perjury. 
    It had nothing to do with his opinion. 
    It is a statement totally taken out of context which... the point I'm trying to make in regards to verifiability... doesn't do justice to his opinion.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1828.658" stopTime="1838.497">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, it... it's one thing to say he never said it, and it's another thing to say... to say that he said it, that was taken out of context. 
    Do you mean literally he never said it?
speaker="richard_d_panza" startTime="1838.497" stopTime="1854.392">
    Mr. Richard D. Panza 
    He never said he committed perjury. 
    What he said was, I think, is what Mr. English read to you. 
    And, that is, everyone who was in attendance at the meet, be he a partial or impartial observer, knows in his heart that Mr. Milkovich lied after having given his solemn oath to tell the truth.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1854.392" stopTime="1856.092">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That's not saying he committed perjury.
speaker="richard_d_panza" startTime="1856.092" stopTime="1926.172">
    Mr. Richard D. Panza 
    I think... I think... I think if you isolate that and if you have a lawyer look at it, he will conclude it constitutes perjury. 
    I think if you review that statement in the entire context of the article, you will understand that it has very little to do with an accusation of perjury. 
    Your Honor, I submit to you, if Ted Diadiun wanted to accuse Michael Milkovich of perjury, he would have published this article after the OHSAA hearing because, if you'll remember, in the article he said he believed that Mr. Milkovich misrepresented the facts in that hearing. 
    If he wanted to accuse him of perjury, Your Honor, I submit he would have published an article on November 9th, 1974 after he had his conversation with Harold Meyer because it was at that time that he believed Milkovich had lied under oath. 
    The reason why he waited two months later, Your Honor, is because the point... the very point that Mr. Diadiun is making in the article, and that is, educators, motivators of youth who refuse to accept responsibility for their action, that's what constitutes a lie. 
    And if they get away with it, that sets a poor example for the students they teach. 
    That is what Ted Diadiun is saying, Your Honor.

    Mr. Richard D. Panza 
    Well, first, I think you have to analyze what is being said. 
    I think that's the first thing you have to do. 
    And... and if it is... if what is being said is opinion, then the... then you next must determine whether or not it is in a public or social controversy. 
    If it concerns a teacher who teaches children, then I think it may be relevant. 
    And if it is truly opinion, yes, it may be protected. 
    If it is an educator who teaches children how to wrestle and his qualifications are called into question because the... the people that he coached beat other people, then I think, yes, his qualifications may be in question.

    The most false things probably, if they can be proven false in their factual assertions... and I know it's a difficult concept because... because what I think you first must do is analyze whether or not under the proper test is fact or opinion. 
    Not just simply with are there some facts in it which I can prove true or false but what is the speaker saying? 
    Is it... and does the reader perceive it as the speakers attitudes?

    That's all I mean to say.

    If this Court concludes that it is fact, I would ask you to note that three separate trial courts have found Mr. Milkovich to be a public figure, and/or a public official. 
    No court has ever found any clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.

   Rebuttal of Brent Lawson English
speaker="brent_lawson_english" startTime="2648.388" stopTime="2699.757">
    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I'd like to address the last point that Mr. Panza just made because I think it is a complete misstatement of the facts and the law in this case. 
    The Ohio Supreme Court on December 31, 1984 made a determination in this case that Mike Milkovich was not a public figure and not a public official and that this statement was not constitutionally protected as opinion. 
    That is the law of this case. 
    There has not been a determination by any other court since that time that Mike Milkovich is not a public figure and not a public official. 
    The respondents would have this Court believe that somehow the Ohio Supreme Court, by deciding the Scott case, has somehow sub silentio overruled it's prior decision with respect to Mr. Milkovich. 
    Mr. Milkovich's status--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2699.757" stopTime="2704.909">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But it did... it did come out a different way in Scott on some issues than it did in the Milkovich case, didn't it?
speaker="brent_lawson_english" startTime="2704.909" stopTime="2740.748">
    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    --Without a doubt. 
    With respect to the opinion question, there has been a complete flip-flop. 
    The decision was four to three in the Milkovich case in favor of making the article actionable, i.e., an assertion of fact, and it was four to three in the Scott case just 15 months later after two judges on the Ohio Supreme Court left the Court and two new judges joined the Court. 
    There have been now new judges elected to the Ohio Supreme Court, and it's unclear, certainly, as to what might happen with this question unless this Court definitively decides that this article is not constitutionally protected as opinion.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    That is correct, Your Honor, you could not. 
    However, going to that question with the Michigan v. Long analysis of separate adequate independent state grounds, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the decision from which the appeal is being taken is from the Ohio Court of Appeals, and there is a specific determination there that the court is relying on Federal precedent. 
    Clearly, the Ohio Supreme Court, again, as Justice Stevens pointed out, depends on the syllabus in the opinion, and the syllabus no way mentions that the case is grounded either in whole or in part on the Ohio constitution. 
    Every justice of the Ohio Supreme Court wrote on the Scott case, and all but one of the concurring judges in the majority cited the Federal Constitution as being the source for the opinion privilege.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    Fine. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I have one last question, or one last point on rebuttal. 
    Mr. Panza has continued to note here that the issue is not what Mr. Diadiun intended but, rather, what the average reasonable newspaper reader perceived. 
    And I would agree with that point. 
    However, in his next breath he says Mr. Diadiun really didn't intend to say that Mike Milkovich committed the crime of perjury. 
    The relevant constitutional inquiry should be how is an average reader perceiving the article, as Justice O'Connor pointed out. 
    And on that score, a reasonable construction of the article in this case can lead to but no other reasonable conclusion than that Mr. Milkovich was accused of a crime under Ohio law.

    No, Your Honor. 
    I think that verifiability obviously will... will get us past that problem. 
    But if, for instance, there is a reasonable dispute as to whether verifiability is in question... in other words, we have a mixed question of opinion and fact... then the relevant inquiry should be how does the average reader perceive the question.

    Mr. Brent Lawson English 
    Your Honor, I believe it is a question reasonably left to the jury. 
    There is no reasonable justification for making it a legal question. 
    It's not like the determination of whether an individuals a public figure or public official. 
    But, rather, it goes to how did a reasonable reader perceive this. 
    And what better group to make that decision then a jury. 
    And I would submit to the Court that, in this, case since there was a jury demand, the jury could easily make that determination and decide whether or not Mr. Diadiun's intent or the average perception of the newspaper... or the newspaper audience, was whether he accused Mr. Milkovich of perjury or merely was stating this as his alleged opinion. 
    For all of the reasons I've mentioned, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court reverse the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals and return this case for trial. 
    Thank you.
