    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In 1980, the petitioner operated some 400 taxi cabs in the City of Los Angeles. 
    When its franchise came up for renewal, its drivers were on strike, and the city refused to renew its franchise unless petitioners settled with the Union. 
    Three years ago, in a case with the same name, we held that the city’s decision to condition the renewal of petitioner’s cab franchise on the settlement of a pending labor dispute violated the National Labor Relations Act. 
    On remand, the District Court enjoined the city to reinstate the franchise. 
    It held that petitioner had no right to recover compensatory damages under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code. 
    The United Sates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and we granted certiorari. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold that the National Labor Relations Act creates rights in labor and in management that are enforceable against governmental interference under Section 1983. 
    We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice O’Connor have joined.
