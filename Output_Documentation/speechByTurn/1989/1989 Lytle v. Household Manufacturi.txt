    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the first case, Lytle versus Household Manufacturing Company and in an opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold that the District Court’s resolutions of the issue in the acts of a claim does not bar relitigation before a jury of the same issue and a legal claim. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Scalia joins.
