    Ms. Carol Connor Flowe 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case concerns PBGC's efforts to protect the integrity of the government insurance program that insures the pensions of more than 30 million American workers. 
    At issue is the scope of the agency's statutory authority to restore a terminated pension plan. 
    I will discuss how the language of the statute, its legislative history, and PBGC's policy considerations each support its use of that statutory authority in this case. 
    We begin, of course, with the language of the statute itself. 
    In Section 4047 Congress authorized PBGC to restore a terminated pension plan and I quote, 
    "In any case in which the corporation. " 
    that is, the PBGC, 
    "determines such action to be appropriate and consistent with its duties under Title IV of ERISA. " 
    Now, Congress could have said that PBGC could restore a terminated pension plan only if an employer's financial condition had improved. 
    Or it could have said that PBGC could restore a plan where it could persuade a court that doing so was in the public interest. 
    But it didn't. 
    What Congress said was... was that PBGC should make this determination, and it limited our discretion only by requiring that we exercise it appropriately and consistently with our statutory duties. 
    The court of appeals slid right by the statutory language though and went immediately to the legislative history. 
    And then, rather than examining the legislative history to see whether there was a clearly expressed legislative intent contrary to PBGC's action in this case, the court of appeals turned the analysis on its head. 
    The court of appeals searched the legislative materials for an explicit reference to the use of restoration that PBGC made here. 
    Not surprisingly, it found none because the legislative history confirms what the plain language of the statute says, that Congress intended PBGC to determine when its restoration authority was to be used. 
    This legislative history is sparse, but it's straightforward. 
    It says that Congress intended PBGC to restore a plan if a plan or employer had a favorable reversal of business trends or if, and again I quote, 
    "some other factor made termination no longer advisable. " 
    The court of appeals simply disregarded this final phrase and focused instead on the one example given... a favorable reversal of business trends. 
    The court then concluded that was the only circumstance under which the agency could restore a terminated pension plan. 
    That approach was contrary to this Court's teachings in Chevron and its progeny. 
    And it also--

    Ms. Carol Connor Flowe 
    That's absolutely right. 
    The PBGC's follow-on plan policy was designed to deal with this situation. 
    These limitations we've just been discussing, these things that employees lose when an underfunded plan terminates, act as sort of a risk-sharing mechanism. 
    It means... they mean that when an underfunded plan terminates, employees share the risk of that termination with the PBGC. 
    And that aligns their interests with PBGC's and against termination. 
    If an employee stands to lose benefits when his plan terminates, then he's going to resist termination, and he's also going to pressure his employer to fund the plan better in the first instance. 
    Because follow-on plans eliminate these losses that Congress built into the statutory scheme, they also eliminate the disincentive for termination. 
    Now, PBGC has three duties under this statutory scheme. 
    We have a duty to encourage the continuation of plans. 
    Stated differently, to discourage the termination of plans. 
    Obviously, to the extent that we prohibit the vitiation of these risk-sharing features of the statutory scheme we discourage unwarranted terminations. 
    We also have a duty to ensure the timely and uninterrupted payment of benefits in plans that do in fact terminate. 
    Again, by protecting the insurance program against unwarranted terminations, we also fulfill that statutory duty. 
    And finally, we have a duty to maintain our premiums at the lowest possible level consistent with these other duties. 
    Here, too, if we can discourage unwarranted and unnecessary terminations, we can keep our premiums as low as possible. 
    The follow-on plan policy grew out of a need to do all of these things... to discourage unwarranted terminations so as to protect the program; to make sure that these disincentives to termination from the standpoint of employees and their unions continue to be maintained in the statutory scheme.

    I believe that the Court could reverse the court of appeals on the follow-on abuse question because there was no significant chance of... of immediate retermination here.

    When these plans were restored, they had then sufficient assets to continue for at least several additional years without any further contributions whatsoever. 
    In addition, the agency did make a determination here that the company could afford to fund these plans at least for the foreseeable future.

    On the separate ground of the improved financial circumstances warranting restoration, what PBGC looked at was the factors that had led it to determine these plans in the first instance. 
    There were several financial factors that caused PBGC to exercise its discretion under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate these plans to protect the insurance program against the risk of unreasonably large losses. 
    LTV's financial condition did improve over the next several months leading each of those factors to cease to exist. 
    That fact is really undisputed in this case because those factors--

    --Well, we did in fact appeal. 
    And I might add that the bankruptcy court did not reach the merits of our objections. 
    The bankruptcy court said instead that it wasn't appropriate for him to consider the regulatory objections we were making and that if we thought we had some administrative options, we should go exercise those. 
    We, nevertheless, appealed his refusal to consider the merits of that matter. 
    LTV moved to dismiss our appeal on the grounds that it was interlocutory. 
    And while this... at the same time, we were also considering the possibility of using our Section 4047 authority. 
    Once we had, in fact, decided to use our Section 4047 authority, we then dismissed that appeal--

    Well, not necessarily, Your Honor, because our claim would be an immediate lump sum liquidated claim for the entire amount of that underfunding, whereas the company's obligation under restored ongoing plan is only to make each year the statutory minimum funding obligation, which in this case is more like $200 to $225 to $250 million a year as compared to our claim, which is for about $2 billion. 
    So that, to say that they can't... that they may not be able to pay 100 cents on the dollar on a $2 billion dollar claim is different from saying they can afford a $200 million a year funding obligation.

   Argument of Lewis B. Kaden
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1586.957" stopTime="1633.938">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Contrary to the government's position, this case is not about the integrity of the insurance fund, nor is it about conspiracies between employers and unions to give liabilities to the government. 
    Our position is simply stated. 
    Nothing in ERISA bars the negotiation of replacement benefits after a plan termination. 
    And indeed, both ERISA and the policies of the Taft-Hartley Act and the Bankruptcy Code support the negotiation of those benefits. 
    And secondly, nothing in this record supports the conclusion of the government that LTV's financial improvement... financial condition had improved in the few months between termination in January 1987 and restoration that September. 
    In our view, the question--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1633.938" stopTime="1645.913">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Do you... Mr. Kaden, you say then that even the abuse of follow-up... follow-on plans that apparently is cited by PBGC would not be a basis for restoration?
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1645.913" stopTime="1685.621">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --Should not, in the absence of evidence of financial improvement, be a basis for restoration, and we will... we will try to develop that through an examination of both of ERISA and of the competing policies of these other statutes. 
    The question in this case... what this case really involves is a question whether this government agency for restoring a pension plan for the first time in its brief history met the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    Did they develop a record adequate for review? 
    Did they have an ascertainable standard? 
    Did they proceed by reasoned analysis? 
    Did they have evidence to support their assumptions? 
    Did they consider each relevant factor?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1685.621" stopTime="1689.156">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Will you find all of those requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act?
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1689.156" stopTime="1702.165">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    Yes. 
    As... as this Court has said in Overton Park and State Farm, in reviewing informal adjudication, it is the Court's responsibility to engage in a thorough probing review to determine the rationality--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1702.165" stopTime="1702.715">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And you say--
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1702.715" stopTime="1703.682">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --of the agency's decision.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1703.682" stopTime="1707.051">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --And you infer from that all those four or five things that you just ticked off?
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1707.051" stopTime="1712.438">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    I think those four or five elements are ticked off in this Court's opinion in State Farm.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1712.438" stopTime="1713.640">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    As prerequisites?
speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="1713.640" stopTime="1744.159">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    As... as the elements of rationality. 
    In other words, if you don't an ascertainable, comprehensible standard, and you don't have any reasoned analysis, and you haven't considered relevant factors... that is essentially a quote from this Court's opinion in... in State Farm... when you add it all up, what you don't have is a record adequate for review. 
    Now, in our view, in this case, this agency had a batting average of zero on those requirements.

    Instead, they terminated the plans.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --The definition of abuse has to include meeting your contractual obligations. 
    In this case what the labor contract promised were these benefits. 
    It didn't promise a pension plan subject to the PBGC's termination power. 
    It said, when you hit 30 years of service, you get this benefit, or if you are victim of shutdown, you get this benefit. 
    The PBGC itself had gone to the Third Circuit and said that contractual entitlement survives and it is enforceable after termination. 
    That's the Heppenstall case. 
    The steelworkers brought a Heppenstall lawsuit against us. 
    We had to contend with that. 
    We had very little legal defense, assuming that the PBGC's position and the Third Circuit's position was right.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --It depends on the structure of the statute and whether Congress ever contemplated this theory of abuse. 
    The fact is, if you look at the structure of both the determination provisions and the restoration provision, if you look at the legislative history, if you look at the integrity of this statute, what you see is restoration as a device for dealing with financial turnaround. 
    Financial turnaround and other financial factors we think is the proper way of reading that legislative history. 
    When you look at the subsequent legislative history, and we understand the dangers of looking at that, as the Chief Justice said in the County of Washington case, it is perilous, but not wholly irrelevant. 
    In this case, they went to Congress and asked for a bar against replacement benefits except pursuant to their standards. 
    Everyone reflected in those debates that it was not the status quo in the law. 
    One committee gave them that provision. 
    Three committees rejected it. 
    And the Congress in 1987 rejected it.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --Well, let's look at the question of how the agency exercised its judgment. 
    As I indicate, I think the structure of the act itself makes clear that the policy... that the negotiation of replacement benefits has nothing to do with the restoration power and is not abusive of the statute. 
    But if there's any doubt about that, let's look at the conflicting mandates of other important Federal statutes, and let's start with the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    Section 8(d) of the labor law, as you know, says that an employer must bargain over wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment. 
    We know that retirement benefits are within that circle of mandatory bargaining. 
    We know, too, from this Court's decision in the Insurance Agents case and others, that it is a serious act to circumscribe the ambit of mandatory bargain. 
    The Solicitor General says, well, of course, we don't permit wages to be paid in cocaine. 
    That's because their is an explicit provision of the Federal criminal law. 
    But we don't permit a government agency, either this one or the IRS or anyone else, to go about regulating the rules that apply to the substantive outcomes of bargaining contrary to the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act.

    On, no. 
    Indeed, we did. 
    No one is asking them to pay the cost of the replacement benefits. 
    We were prepared to pay that $70 million ourselves and we negotiated concessions of $50 million to offset that cost. 
    And the bankruptcy court, as Justice White indicated, approved that in order to preserve the estate for... for reorganization. 
    But it was essential for us to negotiate that in the free arena of collective bargaining, as required by those laws. 
    This agency's abuse policy says when you negotiate that replacement benefit for retirees thou shalt not obey the principle of seniority. 
    Now, in our labor history, the principle of seniority is an important one. 
    It's recognized explicitly in the Military Service Act and the Veterans Act. 
    It's recognized in their own statute.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    If they were successful in reinstating the plan, two things might happen, and it turns on whether the contributions are owing or not by a debtor in possession, whether they are pre-petition obligations or not. 
    There's no question that with the passage of time the unfunded liability in these plans is now over $3 billion, and if they were returned to us today, the question is do we have to make those contributions? 
    If we do, our creditors would be forced under the Bankruptcy Code to evaluate whether liquidation was better than paying that bill. 
    In liquidation, the plans would automatically be reterminated under Section 4041 of ERISA, under the voluntary termination standards. 
    By contrast, if we didn't have to pay those contributions because they were pre-petition obligations, as the Second Circuit noted, then the largest of these plans would have to be reterminated immediately because it has no assets today, and that is clear if one calculates out from the... from the record. 
    So, in either event, it depends on whether it's a pre-petition obligation, but we view it as a futile act. 
    But it does one thing. 
    It changes their claim in bankruptcy from $2 billion to $3 billion to the detriment of other creditors and to the detriment of the principle of uniformity of treatment that is part of the Bankruptcy Code. 
    The result of this manipulation, if they're able to do it, is that they get a $3 billion claim. 
    Today they have a $2 billion claim. 
    Those large claims get satisfied in a reorganization, if it can be reorganized, only they get more and everyone else, all other creditors get less. 
    And the result is they've used the restoration procedure to manipulate the Bankruptcy Code. 
    We don't think Congress, in trying to sort out the tensions between ERISA, the Bankruptcy Code and the Labor Act ever contemplated that kind of manipulation. 
    Let me turn now to the financial--

speaker="lewis_b_kaden" startTime="2542.343" stopTime="2565.090">
    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    For two reasons. 
    One, in the intervening time between the time they restored... they tried to restore these plans or they terminated these plans and today, the law changed to give them 100 percent claim instead of a 75 percent claim. 
    And, two, over the course of time benefits have been paid out, no contributions go in, some of the liabilities have been reduced, but other liabilities accrue.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    No, it's not money they've paid out. 
    It's a... it's a widening gap. 
    When you measure the liability to these plans, it's the present value of all the liability year by year over time. 
    And between 1987 and January when the plans were terminated and today, two things have happened to cause that gap to widen. 
    One is the accrual of more liability, as more people retire, as more people gain retirement benefits, and the second is the change in the law to give them 100 percent claim in bankruptcy as opposed to a 75 percent claim in bankruptcy. 
    Indeed--

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --No, because the size of their claim on termination is fixed on the date of termination. 
    In other words, at the moment they terminated these plans in January 1987, assuming this Court affirms and the plans remain terminated, that claim, which is roughly $2 billion, is fixed. 
    That is the claim in the bankruptcy. 
    They are our largest creditor, and they will be satisfied in a plan of reorganization with however much they get out that process of negotiation and reorganization. 
    The only way they get to manipulate it is if this Court reverses and the restoration is effective and then, for the reasons that Justice O'Connor and I discussed, the plans have to be reterminated. 
    In that case, they will have succeeded in boosting the claim by a million dollars.

    Well, it... it... it is fact that cannot be disputed that the largest of these plans, the Jones &amp; Laughlin hourly retirement plan, today has no assets. 
    It had some assets in September 1987 when they tried to return it to us. 
    In the absence of contributions it would predictably run out of assets and, in our view, it did some time in 1989. 
    So under 1341 of... of ERISA, they would have to. 
    They cannot leave a plan in place that has no assets to pay benefits for. 
    They're obliged to terminate that, as indeed they did with our Republic salaried plan, which is not at issue in this case, in September of 1986.

    The IRS waiver affects the pace of payment and the interest you pay on it. 
    It does not affect the status of the claim in the bankruptcy. 
    Let me turn to the... to the validity or the lack of validity in our view of the administrative record on the financial improvement point, their second ground. 
    Now, we would argue as... as I indicated, under the statute there is no independent abuse ground. 
    If you think something violates ERISA, you ought to ask a court to declare it invalid. 
    And in this case, if they had to... they tried eight times and eight courts said no it was not invalid. 
    But if they ever succeeded in showing that those replacement plans were illegal, they could be declared illegal. 
    They would go away. 
    The contract provides for severance, and that would be... and a new negotiation, and that would the end of it.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    No. 
    All I'm saying now is... I'm not back trying to... trying to review the... the abuse theory. 
    I'm simply saying that the restoration power is neither necessary nor appropriate as a remedy for abuse. 
    If there's an abuse, all they have to do is say so, ask a court to confirm it. 
    They were in court. 
    They could have asked Judge Sand in the Southern District of New York on appeal from the bankruptcy court to say this was an abuse and these replacement plans were gone.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    I'm not... I'm not suggesting that they... they are not limited to that remedy if they can show evidence of financial improvement. 
    What I am suggesting is the structure of the act requires that in order to return plans with all these billions of dollars of obligations you have to answer the fundamental question, which is can the company afford it?

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, it seems to me you give very little discretion to the agency and it seems to me you can read the agency's statute quite differently than you do to give them considerably more discretion.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    I... I don't think you read 4047 differently in the context of the financial improvement provisions of the terminations standards and in the context of these competing mandates of other statutes.

    Other factors in--

    Other factors?

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --in the context in which appears. 
    I suggest, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that it is clear that that means other financial factors. 
    Financial turnaround is one thing that could happen. 
    But there are other financial changes in condition that could occur. 
    Without a business turnaround. 
    You could... you could get a pot of money if you had won a judgment somewhere and be able to afford plans that... that a year ago you could not.

    I... I would suggest, though, that in view of the environment in which this decision takes place... plans once terminated because the company could not afford them... we are now fencing off that part of the case and looking solely at the replacement benefits. 
    Replacement benefits instituted in settlement of a valid lawsuit in response to a strike threat pursuant to a mandate under 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code and 8(d) of the Taft-Hartley Act, the agency has to have more substance. 
    There has to be more there to permit that kind of circumscribing of the collective bargaining process.

    That was their decision.

    We could not terminate those plans on our own. 
    But once they terminate them based on their economic assessment, as they say in the record, that we could not both reorganize and afford these plans. 
    All we are saying then is neither the structure of ERISA nor these other statutes permits this abuse to be a grounds all by itself in the absence of evidence of financial improvement to return the plans.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    --The only circumstance where a mandatory termination by them can take place is in the event there are no assets in the plan. 
    And when that happens, whatever else happens, whatever other violations there may be that deserve other remedies, you cannot return a plan without assets to a sponsor that has no money to put into it, that cannot fund it, which circles back to the financial improvement. 
    Because once you do, if you restore a plan without assets under Section 4041, you have to immediately reterminate it and it would be an endless circle. 
    That cannot be what Congress had in mind in drafting the restoration language of 4047. 
    Let me turn briefly to the financial improvement. 
    Here I think the record is self-evidently insufficient. 
    They had... it was an afterthought, as the district court noted. 
    They had only the same evidence before them in September that they had acted on in January to terminate the plans, the same two-year business plan. 
    The record indicates no consideration of the effect of reorganization or the prospect of retermination if they return plans that cannot be afforded. 
    When they did consider certain... certain factors, they failed to take note of whether they had any enduring quality. 
    They noted a little bit of cash build-up beyond the business plan in the early months of 1987. 
    There was a strike at USX going on at the time. 
    There's no analysis in the record of whether that strike influenced this brief positive performance. 
    The fact is that that cash build-up was foreseeable, was foreseen in December, was in the business plan, and that was the only evidence they had before them when they concluded that there had been a financial change during those five months. 
    The assumptions they did rely on, as the district court found, were fundamental but completely unexplained. 
    The IRS had just denied a waiver in the fall of '86. 
    They assumed we could get three waivers. 
    Under the statute, under the Internal Revenue Code, you need security for waivers. 
    We had no security to give, given our status in bankruptcy. 
    They assumed that we could keep the 50 million concessions that we had gained in exchange for the replacement benefits, even though the replacement benefits would be gone if the plans were restored, a completely fallacious assumption, no analysis of it one way or another. 
    The fact is that part of the... of the record is entirely insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act.

    Mr. Lewis B. Kaden 
    Their position is that abuse by itself justifies restoration, and for the reasons I've indicated, we disagree with that. 
    Our final point is the process point. 
    The question of what procedures apply in informal adjudication is, as the Solicitor General indicates, an important one not yet addressed by this Court. 
    But let me suggest that the suggestion here, that we didn't have notice and an opportunity to rebut, is... is fundamental. 
    It's fundamental to the development of a record sufficient for review. 
    So it is not like a... what the D.C. Circuit Judge Ginsberg called a design standard where you impose procedures on an administrative agency which may bring into play the Vermont Yankee mandate not to do that. 
    It is, rather, a suggestion of procedures that goes toward creating a reviewable record. 
    That is a performance standard in the phrase that Judge Breyer used in his book on regulation and reform. 
    And, indeed, the difference between imposed procedural requirements which bring into play Vermont Yankee and procedures necessary to create a record sufficient for review. 
    That difference, which brings into play Overton Park, is a difference Justice Scalia noted in his Vermont Yankee article some years ago. 
    We think on that ground alone--

    Ms. Carol Connor Flowe 
    May it please the Court: 
    I'd like to first begin by addressing the... what I consider outrageous claim that we were somehow motivated here by a desire to manipulate our claim against this company. 
    The underpinnings of that assertion is the new law that was passed, which took... which was passed three months after we took the action in this case. 
    Obviously, we couldn't have anticipated that. 
    But that argument also assumes that these plans are going to reterminate and there's no basis for that assumption here. 
    As I mentioned earlier, the plans themselves had more than enough assets to continue for several years.

    Ms. Carol Connor Flowe 
    --That is incorrect, Justice O'Connor. 
    As I mentioned in my earlier dialogue with Justice Kennedy, because the agency uses this proportional funding, we've been paying some of the benefits out of our premium funds under that plan. 
    That does mean that there will be a... an amount payable back to the agency once restoration is upheld. 
    But the plan does have money. 
    It will not have to terminate in an mandatory termination, if restoration is upheld. 
    Now, they also... Mr. Kaden also talked about the fact that the company itself might be able to do this, absent a mandatory termination. 
    But he doesn't tell you how difficult it is to do that. 
    As he himself acknowledged, the company couldn't voluntarily terminate these plans in the first instance. 
    And there was a good reason for that. 
    It's because the union wouldn't let them. 
    Under ERISA to terminate a plan voluntarily, the company has to bargain with the union to remove the... the contract bar to termination. 
    If follow-on plans are not on the table, it's altogether possible that the union will not agree to termination and will, instead, if it is convinced that some financial concessions have to be made, will make them in other areas rather than allowing these pension plans to terminate again. 
    But even if the company--
