Maryland v. Craig

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-478, Maryland against Sandra Ann Craig. 
    General Curran.
speaker="j_joseph_curran_jr" startTime="11.722" stopTime="115.375">
    Mr. J. Joseph Curran, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The issue before the Court this morning is: Was Sandra Craig denied her right of confrontation when our trial judge allowed four child victim witnesses, aged four, five and six, to testify at the trial by way of a one-way closed circuit television, a procedure that had been authorized by the Maryland statute? 
    Or was the right to confront satisfied because the children, who were determined to be functionally unavailable, testified under oath, were the subject of unrestricted cross-examination and were able to be seen by the judge and the jury on the monitors as to their credibility and reliability? 
    Permit me, if I might, share with you the facts in our case. 
    In the fall of 1986 Mrs. Craig was charged with several counts... several instances of sexual and physical child abuse. 
    Prior to the trial, in March of 1987, the trial court held a two-day motion hearing on whether or not the section of our statute should be implemented permitting the use of the one-way closed circuit television. 
    At that two-day hearing, five separate experts were called who testified in child-specific detail as to their recommendations and their opinions as to whether the children would be able to testify in the presence of the defendant, or whether they would be better able to testify out of the presence of the defendant, by way of our procedure.

    We... we believe, and state in our brief, that the court below made a misreading of your decision in Coy, requiring, in their belief, that Coy, before permitting our Section 9102 to be implemented, would require that there be a face-to-face confrontation between the victim and the defendant, either in person or by the two-way television, before you could use that procedure. 
    We disagree. 
    We... we believe very strongly that the court below has simply misread your finding in Coy.

    The defense objection, which was continuing, I will tell you, Justice Kennedy, was that the children, out of the presence of the defendant, violated her Sixth Amendment right to confront the accuser. 
    And our procedure, once the court heard from the expert witnesses, permitted the children to be seen out of the courtroom in the judge's chambers, and I'll just share with you briefly the procedure, in the judge's chambers was the child witness, was the prosecutor, was the defense attorney, who was permitted to do all the cross-examination that was desired, and of course the TV technician person. 
    Out in the courtroom was the judge, the jury and the defendant with her counsel, and there were the two TV monitors in which the jury and the other spectators and the defendant could see--

    Mr. J. Joseph Curran, Jr. 
    --Our position in that regard, Justice Scalia, is that there was this finding based on this testimony that the children were unavailable. 
    They were functionally unavailable as we talked about in the Roberts case, and if there is, in fact, testimony that's unavailable... and, of course, in our case if the testimony is unavailable, there is no evidence, there is no truth-determining faction or function for the jury to determine, and there's no trial. 
    That's our dilemma. 
    Absent these procedures where there can be a careful analysis of the expert testimony and if believed... now bear in mind there was no request to have other experts, I might add, Justice Scalia. 
    There was... there was our experts... and the judge was satisfied that, based on the testimony, these children were seriously... would be seriously emotionally distressed such that they could not reasonably communicate... i.e., unavailable, i.e., no evidence, no truth-seeking determination and no trial in our case.

    Mr. J. Joseph Curran, Jr. 
    We... we can only use it when there's counsel involved and only use it when there has been a finding of functional unavailability. 
    The court verdict was in. 
    Several months later there was a motion for new trial, at which time this whole issue was argued again before Judge Kane. 
    Judge Kane again had the opportunity to reexamine all of the evidence that had come forward... the competency hearing that he conducted when he saw the children, all of the expert testimony, the Dr. Shubin testimony, other witnesses who confirmed statements made by the children... and held that... in hindsight he reaffirmed his position that the use of the statute in this circumstance was permitted and was appropriate. 
    Our court of special appeals affirmed that decision. 
    Our court of appeals, our highest court, reversed, and they reversed, Justices, on the basis of, as they read your decision in Coy: 
    "We find that the trial court did not reach that high threshold required by Coy. " 
    And that's where we differ, and that's where we part because we... we do not believe that this Court established a high threshold requiring that before we could use our section or any of the other states who have joined us can use their respective sessions, they've got to have the face-to-face confrontation between the defendant and the victim or the televised face to face. 
    I suggest to you, Justices, that that would be illogical to require the very trauma to be experienced that we in Maryland are trying to eliminate, and this is what the court, if upheld, would require us in Maryland to do. 
    Try first to see if the young children who are deemed by experts to be potentially seriously emotionally distressed, try first to see if they can confront the defendant. 
    If they are distressed and break down, then go to the two-way television procedure. 
    If they are again distressed and break down, then and finally then, you can use the--

    And we argue, and I hope that the Court will agree, there is this compelling public policy not only in Maryland but indeed across this country, that children can be, as the Court has in the past in other cases dealing with the disposition of... distributing of pornography, child labor laws, juvenile court systems, we always tend to support and protect children differently from... from adults, because an adult can... an adult... with all due respect, an adult rape victim who may be traumatized by this experience I believe is better equipped to understand that in that courtroom setting that individual who did that bad thing cannot attack her. 
    We had testimony from these experts, one in particular, that asked the police, please keep this person away from me. 
    They... they were in fear. 
    Read that... they were in fear for their lives, the lives of their parents. 
    They were told never to tell, and when you tell this to a person who is four years of age and five years of age, that makes an indelible imprint and thus we believe there is a difference.

    Mr. J. Joseph Curran, Jr. 
    --No, Justice, what we... we want the child to be able to tell her story and for the jury to hear the truth of what happened, and if the only way she can do that is by being permitted in a narrow sense just to be in another room, under oath, cross-examination and the jury sees her, that's far preferable than permitting in some hearsay testimony where there is none of those.

    Very well, General Curran. 
    Mr. Murphy, we'll hear now from you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William H. Murphy, Jr.
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="1686.225" stopTime="1769.795">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a case where we have the possibility of either good trauma or bad trauma. 
    Let me explain, if I may. 
    Bad trauma would come if the child had been abused and the defendant were guilty. 
    Good trauma would come if the defendant were innocent and the child were prevaricating, fantasizing or being coached. 
    Query: Can we dispense with good trauma on the testimony of an unlicensed social worker such that there is no possibility that the presence of Mrs. Craig could have caused that child to jump in her lap or to say, Ms. Craig, I'm sorry, I know you didn't do anything, or to have a demeanor such that in her presence the jury would have said not guilty, we don't believe the child. 
    It is too much of a price to pay that what my brother concedes is the most important part of the fact-finding process, face-to-face confrontation, be stripped away on the theoretical possibility (a) that a child could not testify, and (b) on the undemonstrated fact that that is so.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Murphy, what... what do you think the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause requires in a case like this where you've got small children as witnesses?
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="1778.501" stopTime="1782.055">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    It depends on what the beginning assumption is for the process.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    If the defendant is innocent, for example, it requires the absolute face-to-face confrontation to help bring that out.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well... where we're talking about a confrontation clause requirement in the context of a trial where the defendant is, of course, attended by the presumption of innocence. 
    Will you tell me what you think the requirements of the confrontation clause are in a situation like this?
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="1808.104" stopTime="1816.693">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    Number one, the proximity of the witness to the defendant. 
    This is especially true when there is a close relationship with the defendant and the witness.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    No, I don't, not that part of what they said.

    Number two--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1839.808" stopTime="1860.655">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Your... your position is that if one of these child witnesses has been put through the procedure stated by the Maryland Court of Appeals and is given a trial run in the presence of the defendant, the witness is functionally unable to testify, that's... that's the end of the case, that that witness will not be heard from?
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="1860.655" stopTime="1861.105">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    --Your Honor--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1861.105" stopTime="1861.924">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is that your position?
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="1861.924" stopTime="1928.033">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    --Yes, it is, and I will explain why. 
    We could not tell from the test developed by the Maryland statute or the procedure followed by the trial judge pretrial the basis for that trauma. 
    That trauma may very well, as the state suggests, be from the fact of abuse. 
    On the other hand, it could be because that child was so chastened by the presence of the defendant that she was not willing to give false testimony in the defendant's presence. 
    And if it is the latter, a socially desirable result has been reached. 
    If it is the former, a socially undesirable result has been reached. 
    But all constitutional rights have costs, and this is a cost, lest we throw out the good with the bad. 
    We take the position that there was much more to the right of confrontation than was permitted in this case. 
    For example, the jury was not permitted, because of the way that the cameras were focused on the child, to see whether or not the child was looking to the prosecutor for guidance as to how to answer a particular question or whether or not the--

    We know there's a tumor. 
    We don't know where it is, how it's implicated with other organs or veins. 
    And before the surgery someone takes one of my surgical instruments away. 
    He takes the clamp. 
    I might be able to say in advance, if I knew everything that was going to happen, that that clamp wouldn't be necessary.

 Well, you're proceeding on the assumption that veracity, credibility is always better tested with the child witness when that child witness is in a big courtroom facing the defendant and the judge.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    --There have been conflicting studies about the impact of child testimony. 
    Unfortunately, these studies are flawed the way that the state's argument is flawed. 
    They all proceed from the assumption of guilt, and no one has studied the impact of good trauma, that is, the trauma that comes from activating the child's conscience when an innocent person is involved. 
    And so... and to answer the second part of your question, I would think that whether or not it would be advantageous to a cross-examiner would be the judgment of the defense lawyer rather than the judgment of the court. 
    In this case Ms. Craig's lawyer adjudged that it was not to his advantage. 
    He did not want this procedure, and he objected to it fully and completely all the way down the line. 
    And so what we have here is--

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I believe we can look at 200 years of jurisprudence where, on occasion, things like that have happened. 
    I agree that we cannot predict in a given case what will happen. 
    I agree that a social worker without a license cannot predict whether a child can testify or not or the impact of that trauma. 
    It is because we cannot predict that this is a bad experiment. 
    What if we made the prediction and in the courtroom where there was a chance to confront there was recantation, despite our prediction? 
    That 15-year sentence would be gone. 
    Justice would have been done. 
    The truth-seeking function of the courtroom would have been served. 
    It is not served when we made an assumption of guilt, and we make an assumption of trauma based on guilt because we defeat the purpose of having a trial. 
    The trial is to winnow the innocent from the guilty.

 But what we do know is that sometimes... sometimes... often enough... that it serves the truth-serving function. 
 They... they... they get frightened by... into telling the truth by seeing black robes, and isn't that enough to support your case? 
 You... you don't have to prove that it always does it or even that it usually does it.

    My mother, who was present, and my father who is a member of this Court who argued here in 1952, have both had the experience with me, of frightening me into the truth, and I am sure that they would not dispense with that. 
    And I am also sure that there is an analogy that can be made with people who have close relationships with children who are then accused for God knows what reason. 
    Those people have the ability by their presence to confront the child and frighten them into the truth.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    No, I think the firmly rooted historically acceptable exceptions ought to stay with us because they deal with discrete instances of reliability, not the testimony of a basically unreliable child... and, by the way, the younger the child, the more the child needs to be protected.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    Oh, not at all. 
    All I'm suggesting is that when an experiment is tried which unnecessarily takes away the right of an innocent person to traumatize a witness into telling the truth that that's too much of a cost for us to pay.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2656.908" stopTime="2673.018">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but your... your... your position is that these kind of crimes that are involved here simply in many cases will not be prosecuted because the rules of evidence will be too strict to ever allow the witnesses who know most about the thing to tell their version to the jury.
speaker="william_h_murphy_jr" startTime="2673.018" stopTime="2733.325">
    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    On the other hand, many cases will not be prosecuted because the prospect of testifying face to face falsely against an accused will be too much for a child witness or an adult to bear. 
    Constitutional rights have some costs, and one of those costs is that in order to exhort one interest, we must diminish the impact of another. 
    And the truth-finding function of the courtroom is the highest of all trial interests. 
    Although there are times we dispense with it, we usually do that in the interest of making the procedure as a whole even more fair. 
    But to deprive a defendant of one of the fundamental tools... in many cases the most important tool... to... to cause a witness to react in a way a jury might find incredible is taking far too much. 
    I doubt if Thomas Jefferson would have accepted such a... a radical revision of our trial procedures. 
    And incidentally, child abuse cases were known back then.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2733.325" stopTime="2736.610">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you think Thomas Jefferson was an expert on trial procedure?

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    Well, let me pick a better one. 
    [Laughter] 
    Let me pick a better one. 
    I think one of the framers who was an expert would have known... and, indeed, one didn't have to be an expert to know that face-to-face confrontation since the days of Susanna and the Elder or earlier works. 
    It really does. 
    Susanna would be in the lost and found had it not been for David's insistence that the Pharisees be confronted directly with their accusations. 
    And so history is replete with... with... with... with times when the fact-finder was going to decide against the accused only to be turned around when there was a full and fair confrontation.

    Mr. William H. Murphy, Jr. 
    That... that... that is correct, Your Honor. 
    Incidentally, the balancing that... assuming for the aske of discussion that this court decides that the right is not absolute. 
    The balancing that the Sixth Amendment requires was not made in this case. 
    No discussion at all, no consideration at all was made about whether two-way television would have been acceptable to the psychologists or to the social worker in this case as an alternative to one-way. 
    And there at least the child would have had some opportunity to see through the camera at the face of the defendant. 
    We don't know whether the child would have reacted to that as fantasy or whether he would have had the same emotional impact that face-to-face, in-the-flesh confrontation would have had, but it would certainly have been better than eliminating... stripping the right that Miss Craig had to be seen by the child. 
    And so because Maryland didn't attempt even to balance that interest, the judgment ought to be reversed, because we cannot take away any more of Mrs. Craig's Sixth Amendment rights than is necessary on a fact-specific basis to protect that--
