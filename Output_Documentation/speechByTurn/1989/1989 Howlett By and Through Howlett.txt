Howlett By and Through Howlett v. Rose

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88... pardon me, 89-5383, Mark Howlett v. Scott Rose. 
    Mr. Beckett.
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="16.093" stopTime="206.097">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Mark Howlett brought an action under Title 42, Section 1983, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1873. 
    The defendants were the School Board of Pinellas County, Florida and designated officials of that school board. 
    The action charged two offenses: a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the due process clause and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The allegation with respect to the Fourth Amendment was that the assistant principal of the high school at which Mark Howlett was a student broke into his automobile while the automobile was lawfully parked on the school ground. 
    The second charge of... of violation of due process was that in the ensuing suspension, which he received for five days, the due process, as ordained by this Court, was not granted. 
    The Circuit Court of Pinellas County, Florida is a court of general jurisdiction in which this action was brought. 
    The Circuit Court of Pinellas County dismissed the action on two grounds. 
    The first ground was that the sovereign immunity of the state of Florida barred the action. 
    The second ground was that the administrative remedies had not been exhausted. 
    On appeal, the District Court of Appeals of the Second District of Florida affirmed on the first ground and did not reach the second ground, the first ground being that there was a want of jurisdiction because of the sovereign immunity of the school board. 
    Under Florida law, the school board is immune from suit. 
    The question presented, therefore, is whether or not the school board is immune under Federal law. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida, with one justice dissenting, denied review, and this Court granted certiorari. 
    The first question to be addressed is simply the fact that the broad ground on which the District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed the dismissal is, as a matter of law, incorrect. 
    Namely, that whether or not jurisdiction exists when a state court exercises or attempts to exercise jurisdiction under 1983 is solely a matter of state law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="206.097" stopTime="217.738">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Beckett, would it be fair to say that another way of presenting... of phrasing the question is whether a state court has to entertain an action brought under Section 1983?
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="217.738" stopTime="253.430">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, we don't think that because we think there's an intermediate ground in which this Court has taken the position that where the suit brought on a Federal claim is a claim which is within a class of claims that the state customarily exercises jurisdiction over. 
    Then, even without addressing the question of whether the state would have to do it by direction of Congress, they would have to do it simply because it is within a class of claims which the state does entertain.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="253.430" stopTime="266.904">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So your... your position is that the state entertains claims just like this against the State of Florida, but it doesn't entertain a claim against... under Section 1983?
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="266.904" stopTime="281.164">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Not against the State of Florida, Your Honor, because one of the distinctions to be made is that although the school board is immune from suit under Florida law, it is not immune from suit under the rulings of this Court under 1983.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="281.164" stopTime="289.686">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And so what are the other claims just like this that are so similar that Florida entertains that... that this should be entertained too?
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="289.686" stopTime="345.606">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    If Your Honor please, going back to Claflin against Houseman, an 1876 case in which Justice Bradley rendered the opinion of the Court, the claim there was based on a... an assignment in bankruptcy. 
    The state court refused to entertain it on the ground that the assignment in bankruptcy was solely a matter of Federal law. 
    In a rather elaborate opinion, Justice Bradley explained that because of the dual nature of our court system and the dual nature of the laws of this country, that it... the state court was required to entertain the action, an assignment in bankruptcy, because it routinely handled assignments in other matters. 
    In other words, the mere fact that it was an assignment from Federal law was not a reason to deny the claim.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="345.606" stopTime="353.194">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, then what are the kinds of claims that Florida courts routinely handle that would cover this sort of claim?
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="353.194" stopTime="404.495">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Florida, Your Honor, has a general statute which abolishes or waives the statutory immunity of the state and its agencies in all tort claims except tort claims involving so-called discretion or discretionary acts. 
    It... there have been a number of rulings, including a ruling by the Supreme Court of Florida, that this general waiver of tort liability does not extend to constitutional torts under 1983. 
    And thus, we have the juxtaposition which Your Honor is inquiring about, a general release of authority, a general waiver with respect to torts, but as to constitutional torts, no waiver. 
    That's the... that's the general set-up.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="404.495" stopTime="414.250">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is there a waiver as to torts which were claimed to be violations of the state constitution? 
    Have the Florida courts spoken on that?
speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="414.250" stopTime="596.604">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Not by... not in the legislature. 
    There are one or two cases where the Florida Supreme Court has ruled that a denial of due process can be of such a nature that even though there is no provision under state law, it simply will not be allowed. 
    One other point I'd like to make, Your Honor, in connection with that, is that in Owen against the City of Independence this Court established the rule that there is no discretion to violate the Constitution. 
    And so anticipating the argument in the... which we have received in the brief from the opposition, one of the arguments is that the discretionary... the discretionary exception to the waiver covers this case. 
    We maintain that it does not because of this Court's position in Owen, simply that it's not constitutionally permissible to violate the Constitution. 
    Therefore, there cannot be any discretion in that area. 
    Consequently, the general waiver also has to include this class of cases unless there is going to be a discrimination against Federal law. 
    Another case illustrating the same point is Mondou against New York, a 1912 case, under the Federal Employees Liability Act. 
    There the state of New York refused to enforce the FELA simply because it was contrary to the policy of the state of New York. 
    This said that... this Court said that any exception to enforcement must depend on some outside reason. 
    It may not depend on simply a dislike of the cause of action. 
    In McKnett against San Francisco and... St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, a 1984 decision written by Justice Brandeis, the operative provisions of the law there... of the law of Alabama there were that a proceeding which existed under the common law or under statute law could be brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of Alabama. 
    But the FELA could not be brought because it was under Federal law and the express language of the Alabama statute did not include a claim based on Federal law. 
    In reversing the case, Justice Brandeis said that the question of jurisdiction, although originally a matter of state concern, is ultimately a question of Federal concern. 
    And if the only reason the similar claim is not enforced is simply because it is a claim based on Federal law, that distinction cannot be observed. 
    And the court must entertain that claim along with the other claims.

    No. 
    The facts were that the car was lawfully parked in lot where it had been lawfully parked in lot before. 
    Apparently, there was a desire to drive a construction truck through that area and the assistant principal was contacted and it was decided that it was necessary to move the car. 
    Our position is that that did not give him authority to violate the Fourth Amendment by making an unreasonable breaking in of the car. 
    He had alternatives, and I think that's what Your Honor is suggesting.

    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Our position is that where there is a distinction, as there is in this case, between liability under 1983 and immunity under the state law, 1983 controls. 
    The question of immunity under 1983 is a Federal question and that of course was settled in Martinez. 
    Here, the court on the ground that we particularly attack, said the school board was not liable because under Florida law it was not liable, and that was the end of the matter.

    And the second is as result of this Court's recent decision in Will, the state in its agencies are immune in any event. 
    And this Court said that in Doyle against the Mt. 
    Healthy City School Board, in which it also said that a school board was more like a county and a municipality, and for that reason, the liability carries over. 
    We simply seek to enforce that liability in state court rather than in Federal court.

    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Well, we start with the proposition that 1983 on its face shows no immunities. 
    This Court has recognized that there are a number of common law immunities which are built... which Congress presumably built into 1983. 
    One of them is not the immunity of school boards. 
    So we therefore say that 1983 controls this case as a matter of Federal law.

   Argument of Charles A. Rothfeld
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="1550.909" stopTime="1599.723">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case is fundamentally about the power of the states to establish and limit the jurisdiction of their own courts, and there is a single dispositive question here: whether a state court must entertain a Section 1983 when it lacks jurisdiction to do so under state law and when it also lacks jurisdiction to entertain analogous actions that are based on state law. 
    And here I must disagree with the reading of Florida law that Mr. Beckett presented to you when he said that there was discrimination between state and Federal claims. 
    It is clear in this case that this district court of appeal didn't entertain petitioner's 1983 action. 
    It simply concluded that because the school board, Respondent, has a common law immunity, an action against it simply will not lie at all in state court.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, let me say as a preliminary matter, I think Petitioner is not well placed to make his argument about discrimination here because he did not make it to the state courts, which could have authoritatively settled it. 
    Before the state courts, he argued simply that the Florida law of sovereign immunity was irrelevant in this case. 
    He, therefore, did not argue discrimination. 
    He did not even argue, for that matter, that the waiver was broad enough to permit his claim to proceed. 
    And the district court of appeal therefore explicitly said it was not addressing the scope of the waiver. 
    Because Petitioner didn't present the argument to the state court... they could have authoritatively settled it and solved this Court the problem of investigating a complex area of Florida law... he shouldn't be heard to complain about that now. 
    Beyond that, the district court of appeal clearly decided this case on the understanding that analogous claims, claims analogous to Petitioner's based on state law, would be barred. 
    The court said explicitly that Petitioner was asking the state court to... the state to open its courts to Federal claims that the state does not otherwise recognize. 
    And in this very case, Petitioner asserted claims based on the Florida constitution, along with his 1983 action. 
    Both sets of those claims were dismissed which seemed to me fairly persuasive evidence that the Florida courts do not discriminate against claims based on whether they are state or Federal. 
    Beyond that, if the court were to look beyond the decision below to Florida law more broadly, it would find, I think, that Florida's waiver is not discriminatory.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I think the opinion on this point is... is clear that... and, again, quoting that petitioner is asking Florida to recognize Federal actions that the state does not otherwise recognize. 
    It seems to me that that is a clear conclusion on the part of the district court of appeal that there is no discrimination. 
    I think that conclusion by the state court about the meaning of its state law should be dispositive here in this Court. 
    If there is any doubt on the point... I mean, the briefs cite an enormous number of opinions from the Florida courts dismissing actions brought against the state or its political subdivisions involving circumstances quite similar to this. 
    I mean, if the court has doubt about the scope of Florida law, I think the solution would be to send the decision back to the Florida courts to determine whether discrimination exists, if the court thinks that that's a dispositive factor. 
    But, again, I think that the decision below rests... gives the Court ample ground to conclude that Florida courts do not view discrimination to exist.

    Both were... were dismissed, which, again, seem to me fairly persuasive evidence that this type of claim is not cognizable when based on state law in the state courts. 
    Again, that was clearly the view of the state court in this case. 
    And I think that you should be held to be dispositive of the meaning of state law. 
    This sort of evenhanded, nondiscriminatory application of the jurisdictional rule is the sort of thing that the Court has dealt with before, and I think it's the sort of thing that the Court has indicated clearly is not a violation of the Federal Constitution. 
    The Court has addressed in a variety of settings similar to this the obligations that the supremacy clause imposes on state courts to enforce Federal statutes. 
    And it has routinely made clear that jurisdictional bars in the state... in the laws of the states to consideration of Federal actions are valid to permit state courts to dismiss those actions. 
    The Court has said repeatedly, for example, most recently in its decision this term in Tafflin v. Levitt, that state courts may entertain Federal actions when they have jurisdiction to do so under their state law and when Congress hasn't vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts. 
    The Court has indicated several times in the cases that petitioner cites in Testa and McKnett and Mondou that state courts must entertain Federal actions if they have jurisdiction to do so under their state law, and if they entertain analogous state law claims. 
    And at the same time, the Court has held repeatedly in cases like Douglas and Mayfield and Herb v. Pitcairn that states are not obligated to disregard evenhanded limitations on their jurisdiction simply because a claim that's presented to them is Federal. 
    The Douglas case presents a good example of this principle in operation. 
    It was a suit brought in state court under a Federal statute, the Federal Employers Liability Act. 
    It was brought by a foreign... by a nonresident plaintiff against a foreign corporation defendant. 
    It was dismissed by the state court applying a state rule that gave its courts discretion to refuse jurisdiction over actions by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants. 
    This Court upheld that rule as a valid excuse for the denial of jurisdiction, even though it precluded the state court from hearing a Federal action that had been created by Congress.

    And it is discussed in the other briefs as well. 
    Together, I think all of these lines of cases, which are discussed by Petitioner in his brief, set out a consistent reading of the supremacy clause. 
    They preclude states from picking and choosing Federal statutes to enforce because they don't like some of them. 
    They preclude states from discriminating against Federal law for gerrymandering their rules in a way that discriminates against Federal claims. 
    But at the same time, they permit states to create neutral jurisdictional rules to shape their courts when those rules are applied evenhandedly to state and to Federal claims.

    Should... should it really be based on the question of whether the state courts have jurisdiction of... of these other actions? 
    I mean, what... what if a state says, you know, this... our courts are courts of general jurisdiction. 
    They have jurisdiction of almost any action that could be brought. 
    But there is a defense of sovereign immunity available to various state agencies and governmental agencies if you're filing a claim for... under a state law for a tort. 
    And we think the same sort of rule should be applicable if you're bringing an action under Section 1983.
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2211.474" stopTime="2263.923">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I... the Court has discussed these cases in jurisdictional terms, and that's why we are emphasizing jurisdiction here. 
    I mean, in the Mayfield, another one of the cases that follows from Douglas, and the Court said... and, again, quoting from the Court's opinion that... that when the state denies resort to its courts for reasons of local policy and applies that policy impartially, that is valid. 
    The Court didn't explicitly hedge that in terms of jurisdiction and I'm not sure, therefore, it's necessary to do so. 
    But the reason I think that it's useful to view this case in jurisdictional terms is not only because the Florida courts clearly view sovereign immunity as jurisdictional, but because as a matter of intent of Congress in writing a statute like 1983, I think it seems to us quite clear that Congress did not have it in mind to override neutral jurisdictional limitations on powers of state courts to entertain claims.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    I think that the analysis that the Court has used in cases like this... and let me set out a range of cases which are I think are... are instructive. 
    In cases like Felder and Martinez, which Petitioner relies upon, where Federal courts entertained actions under 1983, under any Federal statute, issue in that case is the meaning of the Federal statute. 
    The elements of the cause of action, the defenses to the statute, are Federal questions. 
    And Felder is a good example of that. 
    The procedural rule there was essentially an exhaustion of remedies requirement. 
    The Court said Congress addressed that in 1983 and excluded exhaustion as a element of the action. 
    Therefore, the state's requirement in that action, its attempt to modify the 1983 action, is preempted. 
    The question in a case like that is one of congressional intent, as in any preemption analysis. 
    I think that this case, a jurisdictional... a classic jurisdictional case presents a very different sort of question. 
    A cause of action is not typically understood to preempt a limitation on the jurisdiction of courts or to conflict with the limitation on the jurisdiction of courts. 
    And I think, again, cases like Douglas and Mayfield and Herb against Pitcairn show that in this setting, where there are state jurisdictional limitations and a Federal action, the action typically takes the state courts as it finds them. 
    Now, the case that you hypothesize is sort of a middle case between those two sets of principles. 
    It's a... it's a case where the state entertains the 1983 action. 
    And it entertains analogous state law actions. 
    And I think the question of whether Congress would have wanted to preempt the limitation that you describe, even though it's... it's made by the court... by the state in jurisdictional terms, would be a more difficult question than the one here. 
    Now, my... my answer would be Congress should not be deemed to have wanted to override jurisdictional limitations of that sort, and however the court wants to cabin the jurisdiction of its courts, that should be dispositive. 
    But again, that is a closer question than this one. 
    There is no question that this sort of sovereign immunity limitation has always been regarded as jurisdictional, prior to the ratification of the Constitution. 
    So there is not question here of the courts--

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2843.211" stopTime="2983.386">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --Well, let me... let me move away from that hypothetical because I think the case here is a clear one because, as I said, there is no doubt that sovereign immunity not only is viewed in Florida as being jurisdictional but that it is... historically, traditionally been viewed in all jurisdictions as going to the jurisdiction of the court. 
    So that... I mean, there is no question here, again, of the states playing semantic games with its statutes to frustrate Federal actions. 
    This is a long-standing... long-standing immunity lack of authority in the state courts, which is grounded in the Florida constitution. 
    And it seems highly unlikely that... well, I should say answer... make two points. 
    It seems (a) highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted to sweep away such a jurisdictional limitation simply by enacting a cause of action, as it did in 1983. 
    And, secondly, the supremacy clause clearly under this Court's precedence of its own force does not impose an obligation on the state courts to entertain actions under those circumstances. 
    And let me address the meaning of 1983 in particular because that's something that Petitioner I think sort of runs away from and... and for a very good reason. 
    It is quite clear that when Congress enacted 1983, it was not intending to impose special burdens on the state courts or force litigation into the state courts. 
    As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her opinion in Felder, when the statute was originally enacted it vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts. 
    And while that exclusivity has been stripped away during the course of routine housekeeping revisions of the judicial code in subsequent years, there is no indication in the language of 1983, or any other Federal statute or in any of the legislative history, that Congress intended to force litigation into the state courts. 
    To the contrary, I think it is established beyond any dispute, the statute was enacted precisely because Congress mistrusted the state courts, because Congress wanted to create a Federal court remedy for deprivations of constitutional rights. 
    And the Court has said over and over, it has become almost a truism that Congress constituted the Federal courts the primary vehicles for enforcing Section 1983. 
    It seems very hard to believe that a statute written with that goal in mind was designed to impose a special, unusual obligation on state courts to disregard the neutral limitations on their jurisdiction.

    I am not, Your Honor, and let me be clear on why I am not and this goes to my response to Justice Scalia. 
    Perhaps I didn't make that clear. 
    I think that when... when the state court entertains an action... when it entertains a Federal action as it did in Martinez, it had jurisdiction to do so and there was no question about that, the state is obligated to analyze the meaning of the Federal statute in Federal terms. 
    The elements of the statute and the defenses to statute are Federal questions. 
    In Martinez itself, the Court, while holding as you say, that the state immunity rule was inapplicable in a 1983 action, also expressly reserved the question whether states could exclude 1983 claims altogether--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --To that point, I can't speak, Your Honor. 
    But I think that the Seventh Circuit citation went directly to the question of whether or not a defense in an action entertained in state court would be a Federal question or a state question. 
    And again, I think that is analyzed in standard preemptions terms of congressional intent. 
    Since it is a Federal question, what the Federal statute needs, the question of whether any defense or any modification of the cause of action or procedural exhaustion requirement or whatever is valid must be a Federal question, and it turns on what Congress meant when it wrote the statute. 
    The precedent question of whether or not the case can get into state court in the first place is a different question. 
    If Congress had wanted in 1983, not only to create a cause of action, open to the same extent that state court causes of action are, but had also wanted to override limitations on state court jurisdiction, it would in terms have said so. 
    It would have said state courts must entertain these actions, notwithstanding limitations on your jurisdiction. 
    But it plainly... plainly didn't do any such thing, in fact, as I said when I wrote the statute, it vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal court. 
    So Petitioner, I think, is forced to fall back on some much more general proposition that jurisdictional barriers to Federal claims are never valid when they are served in the state court. 
    The Court has already rejected that proposition.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    I would think outside of those problems, it is not clear to me, Your Honor, since as I have been stating the elements of the claim are entirely identical whether in state or Federal court. 
    I mean, there are always an element of the forum shopping when there are... when there's concurrent jurisdiction and two courts are open. 
    But beyond that I can't... Mr. Beckett will have to give you a response to that. 
    I should add, finally, that the fact that Congress did not vest jurisdiction in the state courts suggests the balance of interest that the Court should bear in mind when it decides this case. 
    It would be an extraordinarily intrusive thing for Congress to require state courts to entertain claims when they lack jurisdiction to do so. 
    It has been a fundamental prerogative of the sovereign to determine what courts are... what claims are heard in the sovereign's own courts and for Congress to set that aside would be a rather surprising thing. 
    And I think the court would look for a clear express that Congress had that in mind in writing the statute like 1983. 
    On the other side of the balance of interest, there is not much... the Federal... Federal interest here is relatively unsubstantial. 
    Federal courts are open to entertain actions like this. 
    Under 1983 in particular, the Federal courts were made the primary vehicles for entertaining actions like this, and it should not be the law, I think, that a statute like 1983 overrides neutral limitation on the jurisdiction of state courts. 
    And that is not the law. 
    Just two months ago in its Tafflin decision the Court said that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over Federal claims whenever by their own constitution they have power to do so.

speaker="gardner_w_beckett_jr" startTime="3318.519" stopTime="3426.090">
    Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The fourth case that I would have cited in this Court's line of what we call intermediate cases where there is an entertaining in the state court of a similar cause of action is Testa. 
    And Testa was a decision written in 1947 by Justice Black and it, I think, contains important language on the question on which we're thrashing around here about jurisdiction. 
    In Testa, Justice Black said it doesn't make any difference how you characterize the defense. 
    Whether you put it on jurisdictional grounds or was done in Testa, on the ground that the Federal government was a foreign sovereign and, therefore, the state of Rhode Island would not enforce a foreign penal statute. 
    The... Justice Black answered that by saying from the Federal viewpoint how you characterize it is immaterial. 
    The question is do you have a Federal cause of action which, had it not been Federal rather than state, would have been enforced. 
    And the answer was yes. 
    Rhode Island had a similar statute. 
    The other argument in that connection is a slight misapplication of the idea of the neutral rule, that if a... this claim should be barred because the court does not otherwise entertain this type of claim. 
    The question is whether it entertains the class of claims, which it does. 
    It entertains tort claims. 
    Therefore, under the authorities I cited, the fact that it wants to eliminate the Federal claim means it's doing it only on a Federal--

    That's correct and we think that there is guidance from this Court on that point. 
    The other argument that we have in our brief which this Court I think would be interested in is the so-called half-loaf argument. 
    It's quite clear from such cases as Maine against Thiboutot and Felder that once the state courts entertain a 1983 action, they may not give a half loaf. 
    And in effect, that's what they are doing in this case. 
    They say we will entertain it, but we won't entertain it against the school board. 
    The question is when you entertain it, must you bring with the Federal cause of action all of the baggage that it has. 
    And that answer to that is yes and in this case the liability of the school board is established by this Court's decision in Doyle against the Mt. 
    Healthy School Board.
