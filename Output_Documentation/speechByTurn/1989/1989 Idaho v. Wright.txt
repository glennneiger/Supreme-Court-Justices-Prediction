Idaho v. Wright

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 89-260, Idaho against Laura Lee Wright. 
    General Jones. 
    You may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. James Thomas Jones 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We are here today because the Idaho Supreme Court has misread the requirements of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. 
    By imposing three rigid preconditions to the admissibility of hearsay statements of unavailable child witnesses, the court has made it almost impossible to get this kind of evidence into the fact-finding process. 
    In essence, the court has held that the confrontation clause requires the hearsay declarations of child sex abuse witnesses to be videotaped, the product of non-leading, open-ended questions and elicited by an interviewer with no preconception of what the child should be disclosing. 
    The State of Idaho submits that this three-part test cannot be sustained by a reasonable reading of the confrontation clause, and that it is in fact in conflict with the purpose of the clause to advance the accuracy of the truth determining process in criminal trials. 
    In its effort to protect the confrontation rights of the defendant, the court has made it extremely difficult to get reliable hearsay statements made by child victims and witnesses before the trial courts. 
    And of course that is evidence that is critical in many of these cases.

    --That is correct. 
    We pointed out to the court that the dismissal had been made without prejudice, and that certainly the understanding was that that could have been refiled. 
    It was primarily an exchange of getting the case resolved so that they could terminate the parental rights of the mother. 
    And as I take it now, the question of whether parental rights have been fully terminated depends on whether this Court affirms or reverses.

    Mr. James Thomas Jones 
    Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Essentially, we're saying that the Idaho Supreme Court, in looking at the case, had obtained the misimpression that instead of looking at all of the circumstances to see whether the hearsay statement was admissible, only focused on three circumstances. 
    That is, whether leading questions had been involved, whether there was a videotaping of the interview between the young girl and the pediatrician and whether he had a preconception of what was going to be disclosed. 
    I'd like to go into basically the... the testimony that's at issue.

    Mr. James Thomas Jones 
    Because... in fact, I was doing a little bit of quick research during the previous argument. 
    The older girl, the five-and-a-half-year old, Jeannie, testified at trial as to the acts that had been carried out... the sexual acts that had been carried out against her and against her younger sister, by both of the defendants. 
    A number of witnesses, a couple of police officers, three doctors and a social worker came in and essentially verified that Jeannie had told them basically the same thing during interview sessions shortly after the sexual abuse became known. 
    The younger girl, Kathy, was found by the trial judge to be not capable of communicating to the jury and was not permitted to testify. 
    However, Dr. Jambura, a pediatrician, testified as to statements that had been made to him by Kathy during an examination that took place after she was taken from Wright's home, a day after. 
    During the course of the examination he checked out the medical situation, and found that there had been some abrasions in the vagina. 
    And after that he asked her some questions. 
    And four of those are relevant today. 
    The first question was: "Do you play with Daddy"? 
    --referring to Giles, the co-defendant. 
    "Does Daddy play with you? " 
    "Does Daddy touch you with his pee-pee? " 
    And at this point, in order to aid in answering the question, he drew a picture, and she added a penis to it. 
    And the final question was: "Do you touch his pee-pee"? 
    After making no initial response to the last question, the girl said, 
    "Daddy does do this with me, but he does it a lot more with my sister than with me. " 
    Her responses were admitted by the trial judge under Idaho's residual hearsay exception on the court's finding that they were reliable and that their circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness were equivalent to statements permitted under some of the firmly rooted hearsay exemptions.

    Mr. James Thomas Jones 
    The judge did, however, look very carefully at all circumstances surrounding the making of the statement to the pediatrician, and he said this statement, when considering it in the totality of the circumstances, is a reliable statement and should be let in. 
    He made a distinction between... between competence and reliability. 
    I'd like to just point out the things that he looked at to determine that the statement was reliable. 
    He said, number one, that there was physical evidence to corroborate that sex abuse occurred. 
    Number two, that there was no motive for the two-and-half-year-old younger daughter to make up a story of this nature. 
    Number three, the nature of the statements themselves as to the sexual abuse are such that they fall outside the general believability that a child could make them up, or would make them up. 
    Number four, that the younger daughter was in the custody of the defendants at the time the injuries occurred. 
    Number five, that the older daughter testified that it was the younger daughter's mother and father who were the perpetrators of the sexual abuse. 
    And number six, that the perpetrators were well-known to the victim. 
    He said, looking at that statement in that context, the statement is reliable. 
    It meets the reliability requirements of the Ohio against Roberts case, and therefore it should be admitted. 
    He also found that essentially she was unavailable, and I would submit--

    In the decision in the companion case, Giles, they said the testimony was properly admitted. 
    That was three months prior. 
    No problem for hearsay purposes. 
    The only difference between this case is, they looked at it from the confrontation clause standpoint and said, well, it was fine for hearsay rules but it's not fine for confrontation clause purposes.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In our view, the Idaho Supreme Court made a legal error in this case that's best summed up by pointing to three critical factors that the court did not consider or even mention in its opinion: 
    First, the corroboration in this case. 
    This Court and others have pointed out again and again in the confrontation clause context and others that the degree of corroboration for a particular statement is a very important indicium of reliability of the statement. 
    The second, the spontaneity of the statement. 
    While the Idaho Supreme Court is very critical of the doctor for asking leading questions, the court overlooks the fact that the one... the one response that the child made which is the critical response in this case, 
    "He does it with me but he does it more with my sister than with me. " 
    wasn't in response... wasn't responsive to a leading question. 
    It was blurted out in the course of the doctor's questioning.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --No. 
    Normally, that's right, and... and we're not urging that it should be construed in that way. 
    But I think what's important in term... determining whether it bears the indicia of reliability is that it was spontaneous and volunteered. 
    It was not a nod or a yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir type response to a doctor's leading questions. 
    Third is the fact that this child, the younger child was in the custody of the defendants until just before the physical examination, and so the theory of the case, the theory of defense in this case, which is that the second set of parents must have... or somebody else must have programmed this child to make these statements, just won't wash with respect to this child, this younger child, because she wouldn't have had any opportunity to be programmed. 
    She was with the defendants throughout the period up until the time that she went to the doctor.

    --Mr. Bryson, what you refer to as these... this corroboration resembles to a certain extent a harmless error analysis.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, there is... there is a certain degree of... of parallelism. 
    I think in Dutton v. Evans, Justice Stewart's opinion points out that one of the reasons that the evidence was admissible was that it really did not--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1287.373" stopTime="1288.756">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Didn't prove much.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1288.756" stopTime="1322.178">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --It didn't prove much, I guess is the point, and I think Justice Blackmun wrote a separate opinion in that case pointing out and relying on the harmless error factor. 
    It is true that where you have overwhelming evidence, corroborative evidence that supports the reliability of a statement, you may also have something that approaches harmless error. 
    Of course, harmless error isn't an issue in this case as it comes to this Court. 
    But, nonetheless, I think it's important to focus on each of the various features of corroboration to show how reliable this statement was even though, of course, it wasn't subject to cross-examination.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Your Honor, my answer to that question is that the residual exceptions are written in order to try to incorporate this Court's confrontation clause jurisprudence. 
    In other words, they require, among other things, specific indicia of reliability. 
    So I think if a court, a Federal court, let's say, applying the Federal residual exceptions correctly, finds that something falls within the residual exception, it would almost necessarily have also made the findings necessary to satisfy the confrontation clause. 
    But now, of course, a state would be free to construe its residual exception more broadly than that, and if it did then you would have to view the confrontation clause inquiry separately. 
    So I would say normally my answer to your question is yes but not necessarily, particularly depending on the way the particular clause was... was construed in the case.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, Your Honor, I think where the finding is... and by the way, the finding in this case was... was not objected to by... indeed, both sides concurred that the witness was incapable of testifying in court. 
    Where the finding is simply that the witness cannot communicate in court and it doesn't suggest what normally we think of by incompetence, which is that the witness is incapable of observing or reporting in any context, then the problem is just one of unavailability. 
    It doesn't... in other words, the finding of incompetence in this case, if that's what it was, was not a finding that went to the child's ability to... to observe and communicate. 
    It went to the child's ability to testify in court, and on that there was no dispute among the parties. 
    Now, if I may point to the... the corroboration that's present in this case. 
    Number one, there's clear physical... evidence of physical abuse to the younger daughter. 
    The pediatrician found strong basis for a belief that there had been physical abuse. 
    Two, testimony in court from the older daughter, which is essentially, you could use the expression, an interlocking statement with that of the younger daughter because both of them said that the parents had abused each of them. 
    That was the testimony of the older daughter. 
    It was the statement of the younger daughter. 
    They were interlocking in that sense. 
    The third piece of corroborative evidence, there was physical abuse of the older child. 
    Again, the medical evidence on this is clear, and the... by the way, that was corroborated not by... just by Dr. Jambura but by two other doctors. 
    And fourth, out-of-court statements, which were admitted without objection, of the older daughter detailing in... extensively to a number of different people, including the therapist, the various incidents of... of abuse with respect to both daughters. 
    So this is a very well corroborated out-of-court statement. 
    You seldom see this degree of corroboration.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --I think it's JA 39, I believe, is the place where the actual finding is made, the unobjected-to finding, on the top of the right-hand side, I think. 
    The... there was, according to the Idaho Supreme Court, a flaw in the interrogation, and I'd like to address that briefly. 
    The principal claim is the doctor must have been biased, and here I think the Idaho Supreme Court really went wrong. 
    Doctors do get as much information about a case in advance to aid their diagnosis as they can; and yet, the Idaho Supreme Court seemed to take the view that if this doctor had advance information that suggested there may have been child abuse in this case, that his report of the statement was somehow impeached, somehow unreliable.

   Argument of Rolf Michael Kehne
speaker="rolf_michael_kehne" startTime="1774.774" stopTime="1868.151">
    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    May it please the Court: 
    I have two general responses to our state attorney general and Mr. Bryson. 
    First of all I'd like to talk about this notion that we can cure a confrontation violation by corroboration. 
    I would submit, as Professor Burger pointed out very eloquently for... for her brief for the ACLU, that all the corroboration in the world will not cure a violation of the confrontation clause. 
    If we take the state's argument to its extreme, then we will have trial judges saying, I believe this defendant is guilty and I am sure of it beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Therefore, it is okay for me to allow in hearsay evidence of robbery victims, eye witnesses, anybody else that the state says we cannot procure today. 
    They are unavailable to us. 
    And according to the state's theory, this Court should affirm because the trial judge had a lot of other evidence to corroborate that determination that yes, well, it doesn't matter, this defendant's guilty anyway. 
    And I don't think this Court's opinions have ever suggested that that could be the case. 
    It may be that we can imagine some way of conducting criminal trials that will lead to just as reliable results as the way we do it, but the fact is, in this country we do it by allowing defendants to confront their accusers. 
    It doesn't matter--

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    --If it is corroboration surrounding the circumstance of the making of the statement. 
    Let me submit to the Court that the true standard is whether or not confrontation and cross-examination would be useful to the accused and would be useful to the jury. 
    If the truth or falsity of the statement is determined solely by the nature of its making, the circumstances of its making and so forth, it really doesn't matter if we don't confront and cross-examine. 
    I think of the classic example of the little kid who is too young to testify who comes running out of the perpetrator's bedroom holding a genital area and saying, he hurt me, he hurt me. 
    I don't see any need for us to cross-examine that statement. 
    Nor would it do us any good, nor would it give the jury any better information, because all the things relevant to whether or not the statement is reliable evidence are found in the circumstances of the making of the statement against.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    So I think it's wrong for the state to argue that we can allow this statement in because another witness... an entirely other witness... corroborates the statement, either the medical doctor's physical findings or the girl's sister. 
    That would be more like the situation I brought up before, where the trial judge rules, I believe the person is guilty because I see all this corroborative evidence, therefore I'll let in hearsay from the victims of the crime, the eye witnesses and so forth. 
    And I don't think the Court has ever suggested that we could do that. 
    The other matter I'd like to bring to the Court's attention to start out with is, we submit the Attorney General of the State of Idaho has misrepresented to the Court the opinion of the Idaho Supreme Court. 
    And I challenge Mr. Jones in his rebuttal to the Court to show us any place in the text of the opinion... now, I'm not talking about what one justice wrote in a dissent or another justice wrote in a concurrence in another case, but in the text of the opinion that says, we will not let in any of these statements if there are any leading questions.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    --It would be an expansion of an exception to the confrontation clause, yes. 
    The problem with leading questions is, as research shows, you can create a memory in a child. 
    If you have the child repeat it, and the child is young enough, the child will not be able to tell whether that... won't be able to distinguish that memory from an event that really happened. 
    In other words--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2176.854" stopTime="2190.996">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Kehne, anybody who's tried lawsuits knows that you have to lead to a certain extent to get the witness to focus on, you know, what... what's the subject of the inquiry, rather than whether it's raining or sunny outside.
speaker="rolf_michael_kehne" startTime="2190.996" stopTime="2230.371">
    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    --I agree with that completely, and I believe the Idaho Supreme Court does, too, that it is okay to use sparing, judicious use of leading questions. 
    Our point is that if you use them, even if you have to use them to a great deal, we will be protected if you videotape the entire procedure so we can see it again, so our experts can see it again and talk to the jury about it, and so the jurors themselves can see it and they can say, okay, the experts say you can lead a child into saying something that wasn't true. 
    Let me see exactly what happened, and I'll decide for myself if that happened in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2230.371" stopTime="2233.590">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Of course, you could have cross-examined the doctor here.
speaker="rolf_michael_kehne" startTime="2233.590" stopTime="2265.978">
    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    No. 
    I... I disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I could... we could have cross-examined the doctor till we were blue in our faces, but it wouldn't have shown the doctor's nonverbal communications, which everybody agrees is pertinent, the child's nonverbal communication, and while it might have shown the doctor... if he was intentionally manufacturing evidence, it might have shown that, but if he's innocently doing it, and he's doing it without even being aware of, all the cross-examination in the world won't help us there.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2265.978" stopTime="2279.221">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you could ask him why he used these leading questions, and you could also argue to the jury, perhaps not as effectively as with a videotape, that this is something that can produce untruthful answers.
speaker="rolf_michael_kehne" startTime="2279.221" stopTime="2296.148">
    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    That's right. 
    We can make that argument, and it is so less effective that I don't think it's fair or within what the court ought to allow in the confrontation clause because it just seems rational that the state's going to come back and say well, it could have happened, but have you shown us any evidence that it did?

    In our local community. 
    Partly as a result of the decision below we now have a central screening facility called Children at Risk Evaluation Screening, and if a social worker even suspects sex abuse, a doctor, a minister, a divorce lawyer... anybody involved in this whole system... the child is taken to the CARES program for the screening, which is done on videotape. 
    It's a practical thing, a practical result that has happened as a result of the decision below, and it's something that could happen nationwide if the Court affirms.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    --Yes, they would. 
    Of course, if this child, as was talked about earlier, if the child comes up with a statement about sexual abuse on his own or on her own, that lends a lot of credibility to it. 
    If the examiner is specifically trying to investigate it and the investigator has some beliefs ahead of time, the investigator is more likely to ask leading questions. 
    Again, neither the state... neither the state supreme court nor I have any problem with that or the preconception, nor do we always say there should be a videotape. 
    Our problem is the interrelationship of those factors. 
    The stronger the interrogator holds a preconception, the more likely the interrogator is to suggest a memory to the child of something it didn't even have, whether consciously and viciously or completely accidentally. 
    If the interrogator believes this is what happens and asks leading questions, it's more likely that that's what he's going to get out. 
    If the interrogator finds that he needs to use extremely blatantly leading questions, well, that may... in a proper case that may be necessary. 
    And there again, we don't have a problem with that, but videotape it so we can protect ourselves.

 Does the defendant have a shot for a private videotaping at which he can get a social worker on his side to try to probe with the same kind of leading questions as to whether, if indeed you can find out that kind of thing, whether the other parent planted this thought in the child's mind.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    In our jurisdiction, the trial courts are pretty nice and kind about giving us access to victims for things such as that. 
    The problem with it is if instead of having this interview videotaped and it's the first interview of the child, if the parents have been feeding the kid... or somebody else... has been implanting this in the child's mind for a significant period of time before the video camera comes on, then there is no way to get at the truth at that point. 
    That's why I think it's important that it's the initial interviews that be videotaped or as close to the initial interviews as possible. 
    It does us no good after we've been talking to the child for a year, all of a sudden to turn the video camera.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    Justice Scalia, you're pointing up another possibility not presented by this case, and I don't know if this is where you were going, but I... I believe the Court should leave this possibility open. 
    And there is a whole'nother side to the potential of solving this dilemma, and that is to say that state competency rules will just fall in the face of the confrontation challenge, that if you want to let these hearsay statements in, then you put the child on the stand so the jury can see exactly what the trial judge saw that led the judge to believe the child could not testify reliably. 
    Now, I'm excluding the situation where the child is traumatized, but wouldn't it have been helpful for this jury to hear the... the colloquy on the voir dire to determine competency? 
    "Hi, Kathy. " 
    "Can you tell me your name? " 
    No response. 
    "Are you kind of scared? " 
    "Can you tell me your name and tell me how old you are? " 
    "Kathy Wright". 
    "Can you tell me the names of the toys you have that you are holding? " 
    "That's your name, okay. " 
    "How old are you, Kathy? " 
    "How old are you? " 
    "My... Kathy Wright". 
    "Can you tell me the names of your father and your mother? " 
    "Can you tell me what they are? " 
    "What"? 
    "Do you know where you are right now? " 
    "No". 
    "Can you tell me how old you are, Kathy? " 
    "Do you know how many years you've been alive? " 
    "Six. " 
    "Six years. " 
    "How old do you think you are? " 
    "Six years". 
    And, of course, she was three years old. 
    Wouldn't it have been helpful for the jury to see that before they decide whether or not they're going to believe this child?

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    The word "competence" wasn't used. 
    That is our rule. 
    The rule that the judge applied, the trial judge, is our rule of witness competence. 
    We don't have one of those rules that say if you're under ten or if you're under five. 
    It's can you communicate and are you capable of receiving just impressions, and based on that record the trial judge correctly concluded this child was not and is incompetent under Idaho law.

speaker="rolf_michael_kehne" startTime="2948.690" stopTime="3000.658">
    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    Well, if a child is incompetent at one time, that doesn't necessarily mean she's incompetent at another time. 
    And what is important is what this judge looked at in order to rule that that statement is admissible, and that is the testimony of the girl's sister, the testimony of the doctor and his physical findings... in other words, all this corroboration from other unrelated evidence which we should not look at in a confrontation clause analysis. 
    For hearsay rule purposes, it's fine. 
    And the Idaho Supreme Court said under our hearsay rule that's fine and it will be admitted. 
    When we're talking confrontation, whether the defendant will have the right to have that person in front of the jury where they can see demeanor evidence and the defendant can cross-examine that witness, then we're just talking about the circumstances of the statement, and that's another matter.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    She is filing a petition for post-conviction relief on the other count. 
    And she is still hopeful of getting completely out of prison. 
    The other count wasn't raised on direct appeal because there were issues that were not properly in the record, one of the worst being that one public defender represented both the defendants, and that never should have happened. 
    And she still intends to file that petition. 
    One reason we're holding off is we're waiting to see the outcome of this proceeding. 
    Our suggestions of videotaping have been objected to by the other side. 
    The child advocate amici have said, well, it's not practical. 
    They've said... and I'm paraphrasing now... that, well, these disclosures come out in a variety of circumstances, few of them lend themselves to videotaping. 
    And I'll agree with that. 
    I just wonder what the heck it has to do with the situation before the Court, where young Kathy Wright was ripped out of her parent's home because the cops and the social workers had specific information from Kathy's sister that she'd been sexually abused. 
    They took her into protective custody. 
    They had sole control over her. 
    They chose the doctor and took her to that doctor solely for the purpose of investigating sexual abuse. 
    While I think the child advocates are right to say, we just can't expect videotaping of spontaneous statements, we have no problem with that. 
    What we're concerned about is where leading questions are used and the interrogator had preconceptions. 
    And there is absolutely no good reason on Earth that we can see why the interrogation could not have been videotaped. 
    We would submit that use of videotape fulfills some of the very values that the confrontation clause was designed to secure, and does it in similar ways to cross-examination.

    Mr. Rolf Michael Kehne 
    Yes, yes. 
    If there is a videotape the jury can see demeanor. 
    Of course, the Court has said again and again, U.S. v. Mattox, just one of many examples, that one of the purposes of the confrontation is preservation of demeanor evidence. 
    If a videotape is presented, it preserves evidence of any tainting, any suggestion by the interviewer. 
    And in that respect, it serves, like cross-examination, as a means for an innocent accused to protect himself or herself. 
    If a memory like this has been suggested to a child and repeated, cross-examination at trial is apt to offer an innocent accused impotent protection, because the memory has already been confabulated and entrenched in the child as a memory of a real event. 
    On the other hand, the videotaping of the actual interview where the suggestion occurred will offer us a lot of protection, akin to that that cross-examination ordinarily offers for other witnesses. 
    We aren't suggesting that all these things have to be videotaped. 
    We're only suggesting that a videotape provides the state or the government an excellent means of proving those indicia of reliability required by this Court's opinions.

    No, because it's impractical. 
    Because these interrogations usually occur before there's any charge, and of course before the defendant has notice of what's going on. 
    It's an investigation. 
    The defendant doesn't have a right to counsel at that point, or at least--

   Rebuttal of James Thomas Jones
speaker="james_thomas_jones" startTime="3450.567" stopTime="3563.642">
    Mr. James Thomas Jones 
    Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We're not here to suggest that the Court permit all hearsay statements of young children in, or that unreliable statements be permitted in evidence. 
    What we're asking is that the trial court be permitted to look at all of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. 
    And if the Court finds that there are guarantees of trustworthiness, as required both by Roberts and by the Idaho Rules of Evidence, that the statement go in. 
    In this case, we had a young girl who was taken out of the home of the defendant. 
    The next day she was examined. 
    The doctor found vaginal injuries that occurred two or three days before, at the time she was in the custody of both of the defendants. 
    At the time the doctor finished his medical examination, he asked her some questions. 
    When he drew a figure, she added a penis to it... a two-and-a-half-year-old girl doesn't necessarily know what a penis is. 
    She, in response to questions, volunteered a statement that Daddy does this to me, but he does it to my sister a lot more than me. 
    There was corroborating testimony IN... over and above those circumstances from the older girl to talk about the sexual abuse visited on both of the girls. 
    And in addition to all that, in the Giles case, the Idaho Supreme Court said this statement... by a majority opinion, they said this statement is reliable. 
    And they gave it their stamp of approval.
