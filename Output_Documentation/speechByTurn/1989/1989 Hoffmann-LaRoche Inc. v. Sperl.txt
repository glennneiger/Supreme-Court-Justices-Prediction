    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1203, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Richard Sperling. 
    Mr. Ridley.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="10.298" stopTime="81.045">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This matter involves an action brought pursuant to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act. 
    Under that statute, joinder in the suit by perspective plaintiffs is governed by Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires these individuals to file a consent to join action with the court. 
    The issue before the Court is whether any ascertainable source of judicial power exists to permit the district court, as the district court itself here put it, to offer the mechanisms of judicial process to aid Plaintiffs in filling their class with all its possible members. 
    Specifically, the district court here facilitated Plaintiff's solicitation effort in several ways. 
    It compelled Hoffmann-La Roche to disclose to Plaintiffs the names and addresses of all those persons who Plaintiffs considered to be similarly situated, solely for the purpose of inviting them to assert money damage claims against Roche.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Your Honor, that is uncertain, and of course, the district court here entered its order exclusively on the basis of facilitating the solicitation of claims.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    It directed... in addition to compelling the disclosure, the court also directed the Plaintiffs to send notice to those persons with the notice, expressly stating that it had been authorized by the court. 
    In my argument this afternoon I would like to make three principal points.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Well, Your Honor, the court did three things--

    They would have paid for the notice. 
    It was not to be sent out by the clerk of the court or the clerk, the court itself, although that had been the Plaintiffs original request to the court.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Ridley, we have a good microphone system here. 
    I don't think you need to speak quite as loud.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="161.179" stopTime="202.245">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    I apologize for the Court. 
    In my argument this afternoon, I would like to make three principal points. 
    First, judicial facilitation of notice is inconsistent with basic principles of judicial restraint and neutrality. 
    Second, no authority for judicial facilitation can be gleaned from either the FLSA or the ADEA. 
    And third, the attempt by the Plaintiffs here to rely on the court's inherent power or to engraft a notice provision onto the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and in particular Rule 83, must fail.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="202.245" stopTime="228.742">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Ridley, you don't refer, I think, to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules in your brief. 
    That rule provides that the district court may adopt special procedures for managing potentially difficult actions that may involve multiple parties. 
    Do you think that rule might have some bearing on this matter?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="228.742" stopTime="286.902">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Your Honor, there has never been a suggestion as I recall it in the papers below that that rule would govern the situation, and I submit that that would be a rule which would involve the regulation of the action by the district court, as opposed to the facilitation of the joinder of new parties not necessary to the action into the action. 
    The Plaintiffs, in effect, concede here that due process does not mandate notice. 
    And virtually every court which has addressed the issue has held expressly that notice is not required by due process in Section 16(b) cases. 
    This is, of course, because non-parties are not bound by the judgment of the court in 16(b) cases. 
    Moreover, potential opt-ins in these cases are not necessary parties, and their joinder is not required for the just adjudication of the claims of those who are already parties before the court.

    Well, if they had information sufficient so that a discovery order were issued requiring the... the employer to divulge the names and addresses of all the affected employees, and if that is a given, in other words, would the court not then have power to condition the discovery request on the transmission of notice that the court approved?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, is that consistent with our Shapero case?

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We have no difficulty with... Shapero. 
    We believe that the Plaintiffs were free here to solicit the non-parties whom they wished to have joined. 
    Our objection is exclusively with the court's involving itself in that process--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="426.072" stopTime="444.114">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But you just answered my question by saying that you think the court, if the names and addresses of all the employees were disclosed by discovery, could prohibit the use of that list for solicitation. 
    And I am just curious to know why that isn't an infringement on First Amendment rights.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="444.114" stopTime="463.006">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --Your Honor, I believe that the Plaintiffs could use a list which they got for valid purposes of discovery to obtain information from non parties.

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="463.006" stopTime="483.770">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I won't take too much longer, but I am assuming that it is properly discoverable. 
    I am assuming the Plaintiff has all of the names. 
    And I am asking you what basis it is for you to make the further statement that the court could restrict the Plaintiffs from using that list to advise all employees similarly situated.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="483.770" stopTime="532.432">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --Justice, only if the court has a basis for believing that that discovery would be used for solicitation purposes would the court then, I believe, find it appropriate to enter the protective order that it not be used for that sole purpose. 
    We have... in this particular case, of course, there was no request to the court below for the discovery of names and addresses for any purpose other than to solicit. 
    The court's decision below was based solely on its perception of its power to aid the Plaintiffs to go out to bring in all of the non parties before the court. 
    That is the objection which we have, not to what discovery might be required at a subsequent date by the court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="532.432" stopTime="540.279">

    --Oh, if it were misleading or inadequate, Your Honor, we don't believe that it has the, power, power to preclude the individual from opting-in, but we do believe that, under Rule 11, it then has the power.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="648.266" stopTime="662.937">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It can review the notice that was sent to these people by the lawyers inviting them to opt-in, and if it finds that notice misleading can refuse to allow them to opt-in. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="662.937" stopTime="671.793">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Justice, if, in fact, there were an application brought after the notice were sent out, yes, I believe the court does have that power.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="671.793" stopTime="672.644">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="672.644" stopTime="682.062">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Because those people, if, in fact, the notice were misleading, those people would be in the court as parties plaintiff in violation of Rule 11.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="682.062" stopTime="684.151">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In violation of Rule 11?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="684.151" stopTime="694.990">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Or, with, with counsel having violated Rule 11. 
    But in this instance, for example, Judge... Justice, there was the R.A.D.A.R. letter which was sent out. 
    We did not ask--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="694.990" stopTime="711.671">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What about approving the letter in advance? 
    Can the... can the court approve the letter in advance? 
    Counsel brings it to the court and says since I don't want you to throw out these opt-in plaintiffs that I bring to you, why don't we both save ourselves some time; you approve the letter in advance. 
    Can the court do that?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="711.671" stopTime="758.594">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --Justice, if the plaintiff were voluntarily to come before the court, I think the first question the court should ask is why is the plaintiff coming here. 
    Why should the court be involved in any way in this solicitation process? 
    Ultimately, we would have no specific concern with that as Defendants, if, in fact, there were a commitment that this was going to be the only time that the plaintiffs came before the court, that they felt that they needed that guidance, and that they wouldn't use the court's having reviewed the document for solicitation. 
    Where we draw the line is that if the court were to require the plaintiffs to come before it, we believe that this is inconsistent with the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="758.594" stopTime="773.514">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what... you must be, you are probably confining your argument to the Age Discrimination Act where there is a class action, because it certainly is normal to, in, in many class actions, for the court to become deeply involved in notice.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="773.514" stopTime="775.314">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    That is correct, Justice, but--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="775.314" stopTime="778.806">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Rule 23, the court actually orders notice.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="778.806" stopTime="828.441">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --That is correct, Justice, but those cases are not claims generation. 
    Rule 23 is not involved in any way in claims generation. 
    Those parties have been certified as parties. 
    After the certification procedure, they are parties before the court. 
    And that notice is sent out to ensure that their due process rights are honored. 
    This is a uniquely... different situation. 
    Here, Rule 23 does not govern ADEA or 16(b) actions, generally, and there is no due process or necessary party requirement that mandates that non parties go out, be given notice. 
    These people are, are just the same as, as individuals who have been the victims for example of a mass air crash, where no Rule 23 class action has been certified.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Yes, it is Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Acts; it's, it's Section 216(b) of Title 29. 
    But there is a... I, I believe, a critical difference between the notice which is required to be sent out in Rule 23 cases when classes have been certified, and the notice which the court wished to send out here, where there has been no class certified, where no Rule 23 class will be certified because it is inconsistent because the statute, the 16(b) statute, requires the individuals to affirmatively opt-in. 
    Given that, we submit that Rule 23 case law jurisprudence is totally inapposite to what is before the Court today.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, it is true in the Rule 23 class actions that, I suppose, that the court is not totally neutral, or is it, when it certifies a class. 
    It takes the action of the district court to make the other members of the class actually become parties.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="901.091" stopTime="903.993">

    That they, the district court--

    Mr. John A. Ridley

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, why isn't it equally... why isn't it also neutral if Congress has said that persons similarly situated may join a suit by affirmative act, why isn't it neutral for the judge to participate in the process by which they find out about the case?

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --Justice, I believe that the analogy is to those who might be joined under Rule 24(b), under a permissive intervention situation, where they have claims which might properly be joined because they have common questions of law or fact with the claims of those already before the court. 
    But there is no need for them to be parties in order to adjudicate the claims of those who are before the court.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="982.479" stopTime="1001.402">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but, but is there anything that is not neutral about a judge thinking well, we may have 40 or 50 law suits; it makes sense to me to have them all disposed of in the same proceeding, so I will arrange to have notice sent to all the... all this group of people. 
    Why is that not... you say that it is a question of judicial neutrality, and I don't see that there is any bias involved in that.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="1001.402" stopTime="1086.674">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Well, Justice, I submit that if the issue is claims consolidation, rather than claims gathering, we have procedures which amply cover that. 
    Obviously, 140... Section 1404 of the Judicial Panel for Multi District Litigation and the like, all those sections, that law, that body of law provides for consolidating claims which individuals have brought, whether in the same form or different forms. 
    That's not, I suggest, the issue here. 
    The issue here is the court assisting the Plaintiffs, very actively assisting the Plaintiffs in going out and generating and bringing in those potential claimants. 
    And that, I submit, is a radical departure for the court to do. 
    I think what happens is that we are accustomed to notice in the context of Rule 23, but I believe that there is a significant difference between the Rule 23, situation where you have already an adjudication that these individuals are parties to the action, and here... and, and their due process rights obviously are affected because they are to be bound by that action... and the situation here, where there is no due process consideration, nobody suggests that. 
    There is no effect on these non parties if the court does not assist in bringing them before the court.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1086.674" stopTime="1090.508">

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Your Honor, that can happen with respect to any potential litigant who might have a claim out there. 
    And we have never, I don't think it has ever been suggested that it is the role of the judiciary to go out and to ensure that those who have statutes of limitation which might be running are brought in before the court so that the court can adjudicate their claims in a timely fashion.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Well, there is... there is a case or controversy in the sense that there are parties before the court whose claims will be adjudicated. 
    But what we suggest here is that the court is assisting the Plaintiffs in a tactical maneuver. 
    I, I don't use maneuver in the bad sense of, of the term, but--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1143.763" stopTime="1171.305">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It sounds like it. 
    Let me ask you another kind of a practical side of this thing. 
    Supposing that we agreed with you, you say you can't do this this way, and so then the plaintiff says to himself well, these people are all potential witnesses because they are all affected by the same employment decision, same facts. 
    Every one of them might have some story to tell that will shed light on whether there was discrimination. 
    So I would like the list, whole list just to use them as... to interview them as prospective witnesses. 
    The judge would have to grant the discovery request, wouldn't he?

    --He may well.

    And if he does, and then they say now that I have got the list I am going to send them all a letter, you couldn't stop them from sending a letter, could you?

    I know they didn't do that here, but I am just saying supposing you win and then they come back and say well, judge, we have got another theory, we want to do it this way.

    I understand that. 
    But I'm saying supposing you have won, and I, I'm a smart lawyer and I say well I can get around this, I'll ask for them because I want to take their depositions, and then I use the list to, to tell them about the law suit.

    You really would.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But how could you enter protective orders saying you can't solicit these people as clients? 
    They have got a First Amendment... as Justice Kennedy pointed out, they've got a First Amendment right to do that, no matter how they get the names.

    Maybe the judge would do that, but he might not grant the plaintiffs' request here, either.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Justice, we have no problem with the plaintiffs' using any means available to them to go out to solicit the joinder. 
    The Plaintiffs have done it here, they have done it in any number of cases we cite in our briefs where the court has not given notice or assisted in the giving of notice, and there have been hundreds and even thousands of individuals brought in. 
    That's the plaintiff's right, that's the counsel's right under Shapero. 
    Where we draw the line is when the court involves itself in that process.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1344.990" stopTime="1361.841">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, you say where the court involves itself in that process. 
    Now, you mean something more by that than just having the notice go out under the... on the, the stationery of the court, or the... and have the district court sign it. 
    You, you mean something more than that?

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Yes, Justice. 
    When the court orders the production from Hoffmann-La Roche of the names of all of the individuals so that the Plaintiffs can use that to go out and solicit.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But why, why is that improper?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="1376.662" stopTime="1384.196">

    Because it is the use of the courts for a purpose which is not provided by the rules of discovery, we submit.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you say if it were requested in terms of discovery, that would be for the trial of a lawsuit which the court is going to do eventually. 
    If you use it just for purposes of getting additional clients, that is something the court ought not to be involved in?

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    In this instance, we did object to the so-called R.A.D.A.R. letter, in which the Defendants, the Plaintiffs sent out before instituting the suit. 
    The facts here, Justice, Chief Justice, were these. 
    After the reduction in force, in which over 1,000 individuals were terminated, the Plaintiffs and counsel got together very, very promptly and had a list of some 600 plus names out of a total of, potential total of 700 individuals who might come within their definition of that class, and they sent out letters to all of them. 
    Right after the terminations.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1470.383" stopTime="1489.317">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    One, one, one reason the court of appeals, I believe, it might have been the district court, I think, gave for affirming the district court was that the district court was going to spend some time on this matter anyway. 
    If the Plaintiffs pick up and send out a notice, the Defendants object to it, the district court is going to have to consider that anyway.
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="1489.317" stopTime="1506.267">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    Chief Justice, we understand that. 
    We acknowledge it, if in fact the notice is a, is a problem notice. 
    But that is not to suggest that the court should involve itself in restraining the Plaintiffs First Amendment rights by reviewing... by mandating the review of that notice.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If a defendant comes in and objects to the notice, surely the defendant is asking the court to put some restrictions on the plaintiffs.

    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    After the... after the individual, after the 400 individuals opted-in on the basis of the R.A.D.A.R. letter, which we considered to be incomplete and inflammatory and inappropriate, we came in and said at this point in time we are objecting because these people were never contacted by counsel. 
    They got a letter with a consent to form... consent to join form and they sent in their opt-ins.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You are willing to have the court get involved in the acquisition of clients for the benefit of your side of the case, but not for the benefits of the other side of the case. 
    What business was it of the court's whether, whether these people who chose to join felt that they had gotten adequate or inadequate notice? 
    At this stage, what business is it?
speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="1576.936" stopTime="1618.741">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --Well, with respect to the R.A.D.A.R. letter which went out from Plaintiffs, we believed that that letter was so incomplete and misleading that those people who were brought... came in as a result of that letter, should be sent corrective notice. 
    We did not ask that they not be permitted to join. 
    We simply said that the consents should be vacated without prejudice to a corrective notice. 
    And there was... there is a precedent in the Ninth Circuit for precisely that in the Partlow decision, which we relied on. 
    But here you have the court dealing with people, parties, who are now before the court. 
    Once those people send in the consents they are parties to the action, and we believe that the court has all the power it needs to deal with those parties.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

speaker="john_a_ridley" startTime="1697.635" stopTime="1793.983">
    Mr. John A. Ridley 
    --That is correct, Justice, but what is happening here is not case management, by any stretch. 
    The court has all the power to consolidate the cases which are brought before it, but we are suggesting here that this is pure claims generation. 
    These parties are not before the court, in any sense of the word, the individuals who would receive the notice from the court. 
    They have in many, many instances already received notice from Plaintiffs' counsel. 
    600 letters were sent out, 400 opted-in, 200 out of a 300 universe of potential recipients of court notice have already received notice. 
    And we submit, respectfully, that that is inappropriate for the court now to come and request that these people, if they believe that they have any claims, come before the court. 
    It... it... if the Court can appreciate how unique a situation this is, and how different it is from Rule 23 situations where there has been an adjudication by the court, that the "non parties" are in fact before the court and, and, and the class has been certified, we submit here that there is absolutely no precedent. 
    We believe that the Ninth Circuit decision in the Pan Am air crash case puts this entire situation in proper context, where the court there was facing the issue of a district court requesting notice to go out to non-parties who were not necessary for the adjudication of the case, and whose due process rights were not impacted by the adjudication of the case which was before the court.

   Argument of Leonard N. Flamm
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="1797.295" stopTime="1859.456">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    How the issue before this Court is to be answered may well boil down to how the question is phrased. 
    The question is couched in the form of whether there is anything in any court rule or statute or otherwise which bars a district court from exercising its power to facilitate notice to potential litigants. 
    Why, Respondents have shown that the answer to that question is clearly no, based upon an absence of any conflict, of any statute, rule, legislative history or policy. 
    Aside from asserting some generalized objections which we have heard about impartiality and judicial passivism, Roche apparently does not... does not even disagree. 
    That would seem to end the matter, except Roche has asked that this Court rephrase the question from, is there anything that bars court-facilitated notice, to the question, is there any specific authority for having it. 
    Of course, in so doing, Roche has attempted to shift the burden of justification squarely upon the Respondents in this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1859.456" stopTime="1863.578">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The courts can do anything that, that is, is not barred. 
    Is that--

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    We would agree that the Roche approach is incorrect, but we are prepared for purposes of the argument today to play into Roche's rules that we have an affirmative obligation and we have met our affirmative obligation, and that there... and that there is affirmative standing in the statute and in the rules and in the legislative history for what we propose--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1891.049" stopTime="1927.834">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Suppose... suppose a court has before it a case involving a train wreck, in which there are a lot of injured people, no special statute governing this train wreck like the Age Discrimination Act. 
    It has one suit, and it says, gee, this court's probably going to get a lot of other suits from this same train wreck; it is sort of a shame to have to try them one by one. 
    Do you think that court could... could send out notice to, to all the other people saying, you know, save us some trouble will you, we, we have one case in front of us, we'd like not--

    The Ninth Circuit has addressed a very similar issue and has, unfortunately, found that the court does not have some residual power.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You would regard it as case management when you have got one plaintiff in a personal injury action before you, or where it was a train wreck and there are probably a lot of other plaintiffs, to say let's send out notice to everybody else who we can find that might have suffered injury in that to come in and join this suit, when, when there is no set thing similar as 216(b)? 
    That is an extraordinary notion of case management.

    --Well, obviously, we have 216(b) here. 
    But leaving the 216(b) question aside, if the court had some basis to believe that these people are going to come crashing through the court door anyway, there, there may be a basis for it. 
    I don't know that I have to reach that issue for purposes of this appeal. 
    We think 216(b) satisfies any of the concerns that were previously expressed by Roche that this is somehow proceeding without any statute or basis.

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    Well, I think there is a basis for a Court, if they see that there is an, an imminent likelihood of a number of actions about to be brought... this was... that was an airplane crash, and we, we all know there was not only one survivor, there were a number of persons who were facially similarly situated. 
    The district court, through the special master who had experience apparent... apparently in the airline crashes, was eager to have these people come in because he knew well from his experience that that was a case in which it would be desirable for multiplicity of litigation purposes, case management purposes, to get all the cases heard. 
    I, I don't know that we need to reach that issue, Sir, because we have the 216(b) position of... of the... of Congress on that.

speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="2049.743" stopTime="2066.346">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    216(b) is a specific affirmative statement by Congress that it's a good idea that all persons with similarly-situated claims be allowed to intervene in that action... maybe, though, intervene is not the right word, to come into the action.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2066.346" stopTime="2075.542">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Don't the federal rules of permissive joinder amount to a similar... a similar endorsement of joining actions by the Congress?

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    Well, if we are talking 24, you have to start with the fact that people in, in a 24 situation know themselves about the fact that the action is, is out there. 
    In 216(b) it is neutrally phrased. 
    It just says that all persons who are similarly situated may, through a, through a mechanism, find themselves in the litigation by filing the opt-in consent form. 
    So, I think 216(b) is the clearest statement on the part of Congress that we could get that the idea of a group action is something that they want to be promoting, and, and, and when you apply that in the ideal situation you have even greater--

speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="2132.972" stopTime="2249.906">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --I would agree with that. 
    Roche's principal argument on this appeal is that... their first argument is that Section 216(b), although it provides for a joinder situation or a collective action, is specifically silent on the issue of court-facilitated notice. 
    Of course, that statement is, is true, but silence alone is, as we have seen in many other decisions before this Court, is an unhelpful guide to plumbing congressional intent either way. 
    This is not a case, if I may, where we have pregnant silence. 
    This is not an area where the issue would be expected normally to be addressed in a statute. 
    This is a detail, if I may use that word, which should be left to the court, the detail of notice. 
    So the absence of expressed language should not have any significance, apart from the fact that Congress didn't feel the need to speak on the subject. 
    There is a second argument that Roche has made that Roche, that than the Congress, when they selected 216(b), somehow intended to adopt the judicial gloss of 1938 or the judicial gloss of 1947 that was surrounding 216(b), and since that judicial gloss was less than clear on the issue of court-facilitated notice, why that would mean that the Congress was making some kind of affirmative direction that the... that the gloss that, whatever it was, should not be accepted. 
    The case law that pre-existed the ADEA 1967 shows that there was no widespread use of a judicially authorized notice, but there was, nonetheless, some case law support for it. 
    We will concede that the number of cases supporting judicial notice were, were not legion, but the likely explanation for that in 1947 was that the unions, who were the principal disseminators of the notice, didn't need the names and addresses. 
    So Congress really had no need to be concerned about whether notice was needed... would be given to people who didn't have the names and addresses already.

    --I understand that, sir. 
    Our position would be that the general direction, that the burden is now devolving back on the Plaintiffs to get the people up and Martin v. Wilks, to that extent, supports our position before this Court. 
    The point I want to make on the 1947 amendment is that Congress had a scalpel in its hand in 1947. 
    It took out a certain type of action, it took out that representative action in which the person who brought the action was not himself a grievant. 
    But it left in the other kind of collective action in which the representative was himself a, a, grievant. 
    And when Congress was wielding that scalpel in '47, and if they were aware of what that judicial practice or non practice was with respect to notice, and they didn't see fit to take out all these collective actions, that failure to weed... to wield the scalpel in that case, in our view, would constitute some additional evidence that Congress was quite content to allow 216(b) to be interpreted by the courts in a way to promote the continued use of the collective action device in Section 216(b).

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Flamm, can I ask, and... it, it sort of gets back to the same thing again, but I want to know why Section 216 is any more an indication of the government favoring the court reaching out to bring in these plaintiffs than is Rule 20 of the Federal Rules, which says all persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally or in the alternative, in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions where there are common facts. 
    Now, that says they all have a right to, to appear as... jointly in the same case. 
    216 says that any employee, if he gives his consent, can join this case. 
    In one case, as in the other, the Congress is endorsing a right to proceed that way. 
    Now, why wouldn't it be so, well... you, you say it is so, you say it is so, that under Rule 20 the court can go out and, and seek plaintiffs as well, right?
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="2680.000" stopTime="2728.971">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    I think the distinction, Sir, is that in Rule... in 216(b) there seems to be a declaration of a class concept in the sense that it says... it doesn't say all persons who have a feeling that they would like to come in may come in, it says all persons who are "similarly situated" may come in and have a representative prosecute the lawsuit on their behalf. 
    That is going at least a couple steps beyond, if I may, what is in Rule 20, which just says, well, if there is a similar transaction everybody can go and put their own case in. 
    In 216(b) you've got a representative situation and you've got a limitation that it ought to be a class that at least has some cognizability, namely that it be a class of similarly situated persons.

    It is not just anybody who feels like it can come in. 
    The... that's certainly going beyond what is in Rule 20 and Rule 24, in answer to your question. 
    Roche has made an argument here that, that Congress failed to include court notice in the ADEA in 1967, despite an express inclusion by the Advisory Committee of court notice in Rule 23 only one year earlier. 
    And it tributes to congressional inaction to add notice to Rule... to Rule 216(b) actions that there was some kind of congressional rejection. 
    I would point out to the court that this argument is based upon a gratuitous juxtaposition that the federal rules amendment came in '66, ADEA was passed in '67. 
    If there was a different time frame the Defendant's argument would lose some of its force.

    Let the record show that counsel is nodding his head.
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="2955.323" stopTime="3329.827">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --Implicit in Roche's argument regarding Rule 23's... Rule... Rule 23's inclusion of notice and the absence of notice in 216(b) is that Congress had some duty to take a step, and amend 216(b) or to make sure that when 216(b) was incorporated into ADEA that notice language would specifically go in. 
    It, it is our feeling that Congress does not have the duty to rush out and make a series of conforming legislative amendments each time a federal rules change could conceivably impact on a procedural aspect on a federal right. 
    The, the type of change that Congress would have had to have made would have involved precisely what we think are, are procedural matters, which are normally left to the court's discretion. 
    Finally, the, the point is made that somehow notice, the concept of court notice is indigenous to Rule 23, and sprang fully blown from Rule 23 and never preexisted. 
    Of course, the concept of court notice existed well before Rule 23, and Rule 23 does not actually confer the power on a court to give notice so much as it merely confirms a court's original inherent power all along. 
    The Advisory Committee was bestirred to put explicit notice provision in the Rule 23 because of due process considerations, which are certainly not present at bar. 
    But there is Rule 23(d)(2), which provides for an optional form of court notice when due process concerns are not implicated. 
    And to that extent, Rule 23(d)(2)'s power is broad enough to encompass what a court would be doing here today: the power of, of ordering notice for the fair conduct of the litigation. 
    I would also point out that the Advisory Committee note to Rule 23 states that the present provisions of 216(b) are not intended to be affected by Rule 23 as amended. 
    And yet if you look at Rule 23 and you argue it somehow to impact on 216(b), you're precisely countermanding, countermanding, the, the directive of the Advisory Committee note. 
    Because to argue that 216(b) ought to have notice because Rule 23 has notice, why, that is doing the very thing that the Advisory Committee note cautions not to do: not to interpret 216(b) in light of anything that is going on or has gone on with... with Rule 23. 
    Roche's final argument is that the 1947 amendments reflect some general hostility, 1947 amendments to 216(b) reflect some general congressional hostility to all mass joinder actions. 
    Of course, I made the point earlier that to cut out half, but to leave half, is hardly to suggest that they had a hostility to all mass joinder actions. 
    If they had the scalpel, they took care of what they had to take care of, and left what they had to left... had to leave. 
    Briefly, I would like to address some general observations about helping the plaintiffs or not helping the plaintiffs. 
    On one hand, Roche seems to argue that this unduly helps the Plaintiffs. 
    It, it is our position that this is not an invitation to join, it is not an exhortation, it is not a conscription to join. 
    It is an advisory notice in which the court, for its own reasons, is not acting as an umpire but is acting on its own for its own case management reasons. 
    And those are interests which go beyond the needs of the litigants. 
    Roche also argues conversely the Plaintiffs don't need the help, and we heard the point earlier discussed that we had successfully gotten 400, why don't we leave the dinner table? 
    We should be filled up. 
    The answer is you don't know how many people are going to come in. 
    The process of informal networking, which is what we would be relegated to, is slow, it is inefficient, it's unreliable, it's incomplete. 
    Networking can never be effective as court notice. 
    But networking is inevitable, Your Honors, and it is unregulated. 
    And because it is inevitable and because it is unregulated, those are two reasons in an of themselves why this Court ought to be concerned... ought to be concerned with giving court-facilitated notice. 
    We have heard it said that this is helping strangers to a litigation. 
    Well, it is true it does. 
    But to a great extent, the pooling of resources, both monetary and informational, also benefits the litigants, who are desirous of proceeding with as many people in their corner as they want. 
    Now, the point may be made, well, this... isn't this class action run amuck? 
    That may raise a question for congressional resolution. 
    But we are talking here about everybody being given a chance to come into this action on the, one the basis of fair notice, on the basis of fair conduct. 
    And for us to say at one point, well, you have got enough and we don't want to help any more strangers because the people already before the court have enough help, I don't think the court, at least at this stage of the game, ought to be making those determinations. 
    In any event, that is an issue of the appropriateness of class notice. 
    That goes back to the very issue that we started out with: is this a notice question or is this a question of what is judicial discretion here? 
    If a court says you have already got 400 and you don't need any more, then let the district court say that. 
    But in this particular case the court is not going... we are not addressing the discretion or the propriety of the court's exercise of discretion. 
    It is a power issue only and, therefore, the questions that were raised about maximizing litigation, stockpiling plaintiffs, seem to have no application to this case. 
    As I said before, the precise issue before you is really a limited one. 
    It is a power issue. 
    Obviously, the order that is sought by the Plaintiffs in this case will benefit them. 
    There is no question about that. 
    Indeed class actions under the ADEA may never get off the ground if the... if this court notice procedure is not followed. 
    In our case we had 400, but in the next case there may be only a plaintiff who is not well connected and who is not well heeled. 
    And what is he supposed to do if he can't find the friends and, and conduct the grapevine activities that he needs to, to, to build a case with some degree of force against an employer? 
    Roche has essentially skirted the basic issue of power, and they have argued what should be done, not what can be done. 
    And to the extent that this Court is being asked to limit--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why do you want to involve the court in the, in the business of building the case? 
    You, you sent out a notice of your own to 600 people--

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --We, we would have done it on our own.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Well, you did it. 
    You did it on your own, but you didn't... you only got 400 responses to your own notice, is that right?

    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    Well, I, I, I mean that phrasing of the question sort of puts me in a difficult position. 
    We thought we had a responsibility to the existing class--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3361.671" stopTime="3363.441">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Maybe it's a different word than saying building a case.
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3363.441" stopTime="3369.388">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --All right, sir, we thought we had responsibilities to our clients and to the class as a whole to promptly--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3369.388" stopTime="3370.636">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, why didn't you just send out another notice yourself?
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3370.636" stopTime="3374.659">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --I'm sorry. 
    We didn't have any more names. 
    We had--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3374.659" stopTime="3376.852">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you sent it out to 600; you didn't get answers from all of them.
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3376.852" stopTime="3390.811">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --We... I... I didn't send out any, but 600 may have been sent out. 
    400 responses came in, but we well knew there were even more than the 600, and should we have let... should we have cast them adrift? 
    Did we have a responsibility to that class that we did represent?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3390.811" stopTime="3399.297">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how about... how about just getting... how about just using discovery to get the names and then sending out the notice without involving the court?
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3399.297" stopTime="3409.605">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    We were concerned that if, that if we just took the names without the purpose of... we wanted to be straightforward to say that we were going to use the names for a solicitation purpose. 
    Now, it has come up today that we could--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3409.605" stopTime="3420.133" flagged="true">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but so you do that, you get the names, but why did you want the court to... why did you want to involve the court in, in... to say that the judge has authorized this?
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3420.133" stopTime="3438.253">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    --Sir, we don't, we didn't need that language. 
    I will be candid enough to say that that was... something we asked for, but something we could certainly have lived without. 
    We could have been content in this case with the names and addresses without more. 
    We thought for case management purposes that it provided the court with an opportunity to... to send that notice.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3438.253" stopTime="3440.855">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You don't think it did you any good to have the court expressly involved in it?
speaker="leonard_n_flamm" startTime="3440.855" stopTime="3464.489">
    Mr. Leonard N. Flamm 
    It did us a great deal of good for case management purposes. 
    We're happy the court came involved in this. 
    But in terms of our strict needs, the names and addresses would have sufficed. 
    The court notice set cut offs, set limitations, provided a form of fair notice and provided a host of benefits that we were quite content with. 
    But we could have lived without it, in the strict sense of, of getting the names and addresses and facilitating the matter.

    We would make... we would condition our communication to these people on the court's reviewing the notice. 
    We don't require it as an immediate need for this particular litigation. 
    I think we have shown that we have met the burden that we have before the Court.
