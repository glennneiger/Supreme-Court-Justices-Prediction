    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 88-7194, Arthur Lajuane Taylor v. United States. 
    Mr. Livingston.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="24.008" stopTime="180.236">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the statutory interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 924(e), which provides for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years without parole to persons found in violation of Section 922(g) of that Title and who have three previous convictions for a violent felony. 
    A violent felony under that statute is defined as a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and for purposes of this case is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives or otherwise presents a risk of serious... serious potential risk of physical injury to another. 
    In the district court, for purposes of facts of this case, the court relied upon four felony convictions, two of which we do not contest, but two of which were burglary second-degree under Missouri law, which we contend were not within the definition of violent felony under this statute. 
    The Eighth Circuit affirmed that holding and affirmed a 15-year sentence, holding that anything labeled burglary under any state law fell within the definition of violent felony. 
    The sole issue, as far as we can ascertain, is whether the definition should give effect to the statutory language and limited definition to burglaries which present a serious potential risk of physical injury or whether a definition which was repealed from the predecessor statute, the 1984 act, should be given effect as the government argues. 
    As applied to Petitioner, if those second-degree burglaries are found to present a risk of injury, then he would have been properly sentenced. 
    Otherwise, he should be given a new sentence, reversed and remanded so that he would be given a maximum term of five years. 
    In the abstract, the term "burglary" in the statute is ambiguous. 
    There are a large number of definitions for that term starting, first, I think, with the common law definition which is the breaking and entering of a dwelling place in the night time. 
    There are numerous other definitions, though. 
    Only about five... as many as... forms of common law burglary, maybe six or seven states have that definition. 
    And there are many, many varying definitions of burglary among the other states.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I... I take it that something might not qualify as burglary under Roman numeral ii, but might qualify as presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="193.926" stopTime="218.762">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    I believe that's correct. 
    Insofar as there may be a vagueness problem with the term burglary, it is possible, I believe, to find some crimes which could be labeled something other than burglary, or maybe be burglary and, if you ruled out the definition entirely, you could still get it under a catch-all definition as conduct that presents a risk of physical injury to others.

    No. 
    I... I think this statute can be construed without any constitutional problems. 
    I didn't raise the issue below. 
    It does strike me, though, as burglary without being defined when it has a number of definitions so that it is difficult to ascertain an ordinary--

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --That's right. 
    I don't propose that this case turn on vagueness. 
    The... the question is what definition of burglary is appropriate in the statute and there's a long history of case law in this Court which would allow you, when you are not presented with a clear definition of what burglary... should be taken as the proper definition that Congress intended, you can take the common law definition. 
    However, I think there are other definitions. 
    The government-suggested definition, which includes really all state burglaries, it is drafted so broadly that it appears to me somebody in legislative staff or the Justice Department back in 1984 said, how can we come up with a definition that includes them all even though they are very different from state to state.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    It depends on whether you are looking at my... Petitioner's convictions, which under a repealed Federal statute, or the present-day statute. 
    They have changed the definition since the time Petitioner was convicted in 1963 and 1971. 
    The statute he was convicted under was a breaking and entering statute. 
    The statute in present day is framed as entering or remaining unlawfully. 
    So it would appear to include shoplifting, which would be entry in a building with intent to commit a crime.

    Well, that's right, but that... that's just another example. 
    The government tries to say that their test is an easy test for this apply... Court to apply. 
    Not only did Congress just make a mistake and we should supply the definition for them today, but they are also saying this is an easy test that this Court should take as a matter of policy, when, in fact, there are many burglary statutes which will not be easily applied because they include conduct that may include a building or may not. 
    And you still will have to investigate the underlying offense.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    Well, it is if you limit yourself to buildings. 
    All I was saying is the government... the way I read the government's test, which seems to vary in their brief, but in at least one place the government's test says building... I believe that's in the repealed 1984 definition. 
    And because that test includes the word building, there are any number of state burglary statutes all across this great land which do not require entry into building in order to fall into that statute and be a conviction. 
    So, okay. 
    If you... if you are taking my test and not the government's test and just adding in the word burglary into my test, which I didn't put into the brief, then that's fine and I would agree and they would be entitled to not consider my convictions as burglary.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="692.012" stopTime="697.955">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but... I mean, don't incorporate by reference. 
    I mean, just tell us from the beginning--
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="697.955" stopTime="698.166">

    --Entering--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="698.166" stopTime="699.006">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --what your test is.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="699.006" stopTime="744.287">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --taking crimes that are punishable by a term exceeding one year. 
    Any crime that consists of entering or remaining unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime that is a Federal or state offense and which has as an element necessary for conviction, conduct that presents a serious potential of risk of physical injury to another. 
    In... by way of example, the present-day first-degree burglary statute in the higher aggravated forms of burglary in almost every state... not all of them, I don't want to mislead you... but many states, most of them have higher degrees of burglary. 
    And those are targeted at the so-called violent or aggravated crimes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="744.287" stopTime="754.806">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, let me interrupt you just a... just a minute, Mr. Livingston. 
    Doesn't your definition kind of meld together the burglary in Section 2 and the catch-all?
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="754.806" stopTime="756.645">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    Yes, it does. 
    I believe--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="756.645" stopTime="760.969">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what... what is the justification for that? 
    They're phrased in the disjunctive.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="760.969" stopTime="800.519">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --Well, this Court, first of all, does not always rely on something like "or". 
    For example, the mail fraud case not too long ago... I think it was McNally... you had an "or" and you related... the requirement that there be property or money taken in the mail fraud cases you related to artifice or scheme to defraud. 
    So that alone I do not think is dispositive. 
    More important, the plain language of the statute says "otherwise". 
    "Otherwise" clearly makes an inference that although Congress didn't define what burglary, we sure do know that whatever burglary they were talking about, it had a potential risk of physical injury to others.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="800.519" stopTime="810.977">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So you say it's in... incorporated in the definition of burglary by the word "otherwise" is the requirement that there by a serious potential risk of physical injury to others.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="810.977" stopTime="811.497">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    That's right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="811.497" stopTime="816.079">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So you are not really melding it together then in your view. 
    You... you are simply construing the statute.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="816.079" stopTime="857.818">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    That's right. 
    And... and the legislative history, I think, thoroughly supports it. 
    I know not everybody thinks the legislative history is important, but the comments we have from the people in the House, who were voting on this and fighting not to include any property crimes at all because we just want to get bad people and are burglaries really that bad... that was the gist of the debate in the House. 
    And they finally got convinced by the people in the Justice Department and the Senate that, well, perhaps, some of these burglaries should stay and be enhancing offenses, and so let's get the violent ones. 
    I think that's really what happened in this case, although the final enacted version of the statute is not clear because there was no committee report.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --That's right and if... I think it is within this Court's prerogative, certainly, to construe it that way and examine the underlying conduct in a case-by-case basis. 
    As a matter of policy, I'm not sure that's what you want to do and force the district courts to be burdened that way. 
    And I think you have a body of case law which supports interpreting it otherwise. 
    Normally, Federal criminal statutes are construed in a uniform way. 
    The intent of Congress is presumed to be that they will be applied from some definition. 
    And although they may make a reference to state law, that the state definitions themselves should not control it, that it will be a Federal definition applied to the state crimes. 
    Just as convictions in this statute have been previously interpreted I think in the Dickerson case. 
    They--

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --No. 
    My proposed test is that it is the elements of the crime itself. 
    As... I'm just willing to... to understand, yes, it does say conduct and it's not positively clear that they were saying, well, there could a categorical approach. 
    It could be conduct in an element or it may not be and so--

    Even... even in that event, we're still going to have to decide, not case by case but certainly element by element, which particular things in burglary statutes create a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. 
    For example, does nighttime do it for those burglary statutes that require entering a building by night? 
    Or, for that matter, does the requirement of a building that belongs to another, is that alone enough? 
    And it may well be that after applying your test, we could very well end up right where the government's test is, by your root, determining that every element the government would... would include in its test, is indeed the sort of element that creates a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

 For example, does nighttime do it for those burglary statutes that require entering a building by night? 
 Or, for that matter, does the requirement of a building that belongs to another, is that alone enough? 
 And it may well be that after applying your test, we could very well end up right where the government's test is, by your root, determining that every element the government would... would include in its test, is indeed the sort of element that creates a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --I think you could. 
    But I think after you consider the statutes that are out their and realize that you will be including crimes like shoplifting, which, believe it or not, really is a burglary... felony burglary offense out in California, that those kinds of crimes simply are not violent conduct. 
    And I think if you frame a test that way, you are not doing justice to the words that Congress chose when they said violent felony. 
    We're talking about felonies where there is somebody there and they could get hurt.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but I... I think that the common law theory of burglary was that if you broke into a dwelling at the... nighttime, the people could come home while you were there even if they weren't there when you came. 
    That there was a risk. 
    It didn't have to be a risk which materialized.
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="1074.484" stopTime="1109.288">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    Well, I think that the risk of a response or someone returning alone is not enough to find the serious potential risk of injury to another. 
    If... if you decide that a... somebody could return is enough, then you really by implication, I think, have to extend that to almost every crime that there is. 
    Somebody could investigate. 
    The police could always stumble upon a numbers runner or a prostitution ring or, you know, somebody else could come upon the crime while it's happening. 
    Whether or not it's a burglary or anything else, I think just the mere risk of investigation--

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --Well, attempted robbery with a phoney gun falls under the first definition. 
    Any crime against the person is already covered under the statute. 
    Subdivision 1, which is printed in the briefs, says 
    "any crime that has as an element the threatened or actual use of force against the person of another. " 
    So, we've already got all of those crimes in Subdivision 1. 
    And that extends from all the robberies to murder, rape, kidnapping, any number of other things. 
    The only question, really, with respect to Subdivision 2 is what property crimes--

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --That... that's one of them. 
    I set forth a number, and I believe really that number three is duplicated because it says threatening somebody and that means somebody's there also. 
    So there is somebody occupied. 
    I also include the presence of a weapon, which, you know, you may be able to say, well, how can a weapon be dangerous if there's nobody there to be shot? 
    But I think that states an awful lot about the burglar's state of mind. 
    This isn't just somebody who's sneaking around, casing joints where he can get in and out when nobody is there. 
    This is somebody who's going in and he is ready willing and able to kill them, harm them or maim them, or do whatever is necessary if somebody returns. 
    And that's when I think you take that minimal risk which is always there of somebody investigating. 
    That gets heightened to a serious risk if they have a gun or a dangerous weapon.

 It may only refer back to the immediately preceding phrase which is "involves use of explosives". 
 And, indeed, one is lead to believe that that's what it refers back to since it also uses the word "involves". 
 So the thing reads, is burglary, arson or extortion, involves use of explosives or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury. 
 It seems to me that all the "otherwise" is attached to is the use of explosives, not the... not the three crimes that are specifically named.

    Well, I suppose I will have to agree that that's a possibility, as is Justice O'Connor's interpretation. 
    But the fact of the matter is, is that the language is not clear. 
    What we have here is an ambiguous criminal statute and the rule of lenity which this Court has consistently upheld as recently as yesterday, mandates that this Court construe the statute in favor of the defendant.

    Well, that's a big problem in this case because we really don't know. 
    In 1971 I was able to... I was able to locate the police report from 1971. 
    But that... and that was a commercial structure, a gas station, at 3:00 in the morning that was unoccupied and the defendant was unarmed. 
    He got caught... or his friends got caught crawling out of a window with a case of oil. 
    [Laughter] 
    But the 1963 conviction, we don't know. 
    The government was... didn't produce any evidence of the police reports or the case files. 
    I called and was unable to locate it and the probation office report indicates the same, that they were unable to locate those files.

    All you know is that it's second-degree burglary under Missouri law.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    It's second-degree burglary and we also know that there was $15.25 in restitution ordered to be made to Wilkin's Food Shop, wherever that may be. 
    But... so, I would assume with Wilkin's Food Shop being involved, that that particular count wouldn't be common law burglary. 
    But there were two other counts... because that was a three-count conviction... and we really don't know what was involved in those counts. 
    I believe I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Michael R. Lazerwitz
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1522.681" stopTime="1598.316">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Armed Career Criminal Amendments Act of 1986 defines the term "violent felony", which may trigger a mandatory minimum sentence, to include any felony that is 
    "burglary, arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. " 
    Congress, however, did not further define the term burglary, as it did in the predecessor 1984 statute. 
    The narrow question presented here is whether Petitioner's Missouri burglary convictions are violent felonies under the 1986 act. 
    But in order to resolve that question, the Court must first decide what Congress meant by the term 2 of Section 924(e)(2)(B). 
    But as it turns out, getting to the bottom of the first inquiry, effectively resolves the second issue of statutory construction and ultimately the question presented in this case. 
    In our view, the pertinent language of Section 924(e), 1986 version of the statute, the broad contemporary definition that was explicitly contained in the 1984 act.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --I will explain. 
    And Petitioner essentially concedes the point in his proposed definition. 
    The first thing we have to do... first of all, we could make believe that there were no '84 definition. 
    We have a statute now. 
    Congress uses the term burglary. 
    Well, what does that term mean? 
    This Court has long held that when a term has an ordinary contemporary meaning and Congress doesn't otherwise define it the Court will presume that Congress intends that meaning. 
    Today, and in 1986, the term burglary does have a core, shared meaning in this country and that is the unlawfully entering or remaining in someone else's building with the intent to commit a state or Federal offense.

    --That is the core definition of burglary that is in place in 41 states today and, agreed, there are many states that have a broader definition. 
    But this is what, in terms of the common denominator, so to speak, of what burglary is today. 
    There's no doubt that some states, many states, will punish as burglary, breaking into a car, breaking into a vending machine.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Well, there are... there are... as we counted and... there are five states that have retained the common law definition of burglary. 
    And just to take care of that point now, one of the reasons why this Court shouldn't adopt the common law definition is it would effectively write the burglary predicate offense out of the statute. 
    And we certainly know that Congress didn't want that because the whole point of the act, at least in '84, was to get burglars in Federal prisons if they commit enough crimes.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --I'd like to clarify one point that wasn't as clear in our brief as it should have been. 
    The word "entering" in a burglary provision is a term of art. 
    It doesn't mean walking into a public building. 
    And here's an example. 
    Suppose a witness intends to commit perjury on the witness stand. 
    He walks into the Federal courthouse intending to commit an offense. 
    He may become a perjurer that day, but he is not a burglar. 
    And that is not what Congress had in mind, and that is not what most states have in mind. 
    California does. 
    My adversary is correct. 
    California punishes as burglary shoplifting.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --There are two answers to that, Justice O'Connor. 
    We do know what happen because petitioner, himself, conceded what he did. 
    And you find it in the Joint Appendix at 11 and 12, which is a filing that he made in the district court. 
    He told us, one, that we know from... actually we know from the police reports that were in evidence that there was a break-in into a service station. 
    The second offense, the '63 burglary was in Petitioner's own words which he said to a probation officer, 
    "I went with a friend, and he broke into his girlfriend's house to pick up his clothes. " 
    Now, that might sound innocuous, but that's a burglary. 
    That's, in fact, a more serious burglary than the service station.

    I agree that burglary is a crime under the statute. 
    You don't have to prove separately that there was a danger to another person. 
    We accept your definition, let's say. 
    It requires that it be in a building. 
    What I believe your adversary is saying is that means if you have a state which has a definition of a statute that says it is burglary if it's done at night or in a building, you would not be able to use that for purposes of this statute because it was not necessary in order to obtain that conviction, to prove that the defendant was in a building.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    It's not a sensible way because, first of all, it's not what Congress had in mind and it effectively would take out of the... would narrow the statute's reach in such a way that would make it ineffective as opposed... with respect to burglaries. 
    And that's not the way... and it's... again, there's a difference between Subsection 1 and Subsection 2. 
    In Subsection 1, Congress is speaking about elements necessary for a conviction. 
    That's not the language in Subsection 2, which is broader. 
    And that's our position. 
    And if the Court is concerned about a case-by-case inquiry, I really think that's not such... it's not such an onerous burden.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2588.935" stopTime="2599.243">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but I think the Court has adopted common law definitions at times when perhaps common law had been superseded in places by... by statute.
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="2599.243" stopTime="2640.598">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Well, in Parron and Bell and even in the Reagan case from 1895, the Court has said, listen, when common law no longer applies or obtains in society, we are not going to infer that Congress used it. 
    And that's... it couldn't be more apparent than here where everyone agrees that there are so few states that have common law. 
    Now, with the elements of the offense test, we certainly reject that approach because it would accomplish the same thing and read the statute in such a way that it's not written and also ignore... I haven't harped on the legislative record, but it is important because the legislative record shows that Congress had something particular in mind.

    And we would not, if we were presented with the California predicate offense in that... of that type, we would not include it. 
    And as far as I know, we haven't seen anything like that. 
    In a similar vein, a lot of states criminalize breaking and entering into a car as burglary. 
    Again, that wouldn't satisfy the definition that Congress had in mind. 
    That's not the type of offense that Congress wanted as a predicate offense.

speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="2741.271" stopTime="2802.402">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    We didn't cite any case and I don't know of a particular one, but I don't think this is an example of Congress repealing the definition. 
    And I say that because Congress... there's no doubt that Congress changed the definitions of the statute. 
    It reworked the entire statute when it included drug offenses and what is now violent felony. 
    But, at the same time, it inserted the word "burglary". 
    And that is a telling point, because if Congress where repealing entirely its treatment of burglary, it wouldn't have put burglary back in. 
    And it wouldn't have done so because, if in fact Petitioner is right... the words "burglary, arson, extortion" are essentially superfluous, because the burglaries that he's concerned about would fall within the catch-all phrase. 
    But Congress did just the opposite. 
    They... Congress put in the word "burglary, arson and extortion"... words... and for the Court's information, three predicate offenses that were first voiced to the House in the hearings from the Justice Department.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2802.402" stopTime="2810.810">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And what's your position on the use of the ending phrase "or otherwise involves conduct"? 
    You say that just modifies explosives?
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="2810.810" stopTime="2824.819">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    The way I have been thinking about it is the "or otherwise" modifies the... the verbs "is" a crime, "is" burglary, "involves" use of explosives, or--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2824.819" stopTime="2833.735">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, then that suggests that burglary must somehow involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, don't you think?
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="2833.735" stopTime="2890.195">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --No, I don't think so because I don't think the word "otherwise" can bear that type of weight. 
    And one way of looking at is... there are several ways. 
    The most natural reading is that Congress has decided that certain generic offenses... burglary, arson, extortion... do present the type of conduct that presents a danger. 
    And that goes back to what the court was discussing before. 
    Congress can be seen as essentially preempting the inquiry that was raised before. 
    How do we know whether if it's a building, it's potentially violent? 
    How do we know whether someone is inside? 
    Does that make it potentially violent? 
    If the Court wants to give the phrase "or otherwise" an aggressive reading, which we don't urge at all, but even if the Court wants to, I think the most that you can get out of is Congress had decided that burglaries, as we define them, as excluding the breaking of a car, the breaking of a Coke machine, the shoplifter, that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2890.195" stopTime="2906.377">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That would also shed some light on what Congress meant by burglary. 
    If we are in doubt about what the definition of burglary is, it would suggest that the definition of burglary would have to involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to other... to another.
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="2906.377" stopTime="2964.947">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --Well, I don't think so and frankly, the... the phrasing "or otherwise", while we don't even think that it should be given an aggressive reading, is because look what it does. 
    It actually takes away a negative inference. 
    And if Congress... Congress put back in the statute burglary, arson, extortion, it didn't want courts to decide whether a particular burglary is violent or not. 
    And so it... it included certain predicate property offenses, but said, look, we also want to include other types of offenses. 
    Other offenses... for example, vandalizing a train track, that would be conduct that otherwise presents a potential violence to person. 
    The Tylenol poisoning case, that type of conduct would fit within the catch-all. 
    And so Congress' using of that phrasing doesn't suggest at all that it meant to modify the word burglary, which would be an awfully cramped reading of... of that phrase. 
    And "otherwise", in any event, as used as an adverb means in different circumstances, differently, in other circumstances.

    One example would be in Section 2118(b) of Title 18, which is the offense of burglarizing a place of business that's licensed to dispense controlled substances.

    That's were this definition came from. 
    And that is what's been developed as the consensus of burglary. 
    The fact that other states criminalize broader conduct doesn't... you can't fault Congress for... for adopting a more narrow definition. 
    And... I mean, that's our position we... and that's one of the reasons why we disagree with the Eighth Circuit here. 
    It just doesn't matter what the state calls it, it's what is actually going on.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    We don't think, for example, if you're charged with armed robbery and you plead to simple larceny that we can walk into a district judge and say, look, although he is convicted of simple larceny he really used a gun. 
    That's not fair because that's not what he stands convicted of. 
    And that's how we... that's how we've been applying that... the statute. 
    If there are no further question, thank you.

   Rebuttal of Bruce D. Livingston
speaker="bruce_d_livingston" startTime="3256.229" stopTime="3308.932">
    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would just like to point out a couple of quick items in my remaining minutes. 
    First, I note... Note 8 of the government's brief, they indicate several places where there are the use of the common law burglary or other statutes different than their interpretation for the term "burglary". 
    Second, I think this is a plain language case. 
    More than anything, although the legislative history supports us, in a response to Justice Scalia's question about the comma or about "or otherwise" modifying "involves use of explosives", I think that the comma after "involves use of explosives" and before "or otherwise" precludes that interpretation and it's just as likely that it could be interrupted to modify the entire portion of the statute.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    I also would like to address Justice White's question about expanding the act. 
    I think it is important, and we made the point in our reply brief, and I think the legislative history definitely supports us in this regard, that although the change from 1984 to 1986 expanded the act... which it undeniably did; it added all of the various crimes... it used to just be robbery and burglary and they expanded it to get murder, rape, mayhem, whatever else. 
    But there was a great deal of debate about excluding property crimes and, specifically, burglary. 
    And what we have here now is a definition where I believe--

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    --Only to those burglars which would be like the first-degree burglary statute in Missouri which really have that serious potential risk of injury. 
    I also think that it's very clear that the government definition that's proposed is not an ordinary or contemporary definition. 
    It's a subset. 
    Somehow or other it will reach the various burglary crimes across this country, but it is not the burglary crime themselves. 
    They are very different. 
    And it clearly omits any consideration of the very, very narrow burglary crimes which we... it's our position... are really what Congress was intending and that's the aggravated burglaries and the violent burglaries, the higher degrees of burglary. 
    Nothing in the government's definition addresses that distinction and all of those other statutes that are out there and are also called burglary.

    Mr. Bruce D. Livingston 
    They also are not defined. 
    We have stated in our brief that extortion, particularly is problematic. 
    I think you might be able to somehow, when you're defining what's a risk of injury, maybe arson seems to be a kind of crime that has a risk of injury, and I wouldn't contest it. 
    It is not an issue here to day anyway. 
    Extortion, Justice O'Connor's example, is a very good one of the kind of extortion that doesn't present a risk of injury and I think it's very appropriate that that not be an enhancing offense. 
    It's not the same as, hey, give me some money or I'll shoot or kill your child. 
    That's the kind of extortion that was meant, not, hey, I'm going to tell some nasty stories about you if you don't give me some money. 
    That's not a risk of injury, and I would think there's a difference between those two kinds of extortion. 
    I see my time is up.
