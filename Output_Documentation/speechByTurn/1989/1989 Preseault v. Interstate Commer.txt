   Announcement of Justice Brennan

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The first of the cases is No. 88-1076, Preseault versus the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    It is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The question presented is the constitutionality of what is styled a federal rails-to-trails statute. 
    That is a statute under which unused railroad rights of way are converted into recreational trails notwithstanding whatever revisionary property interest exist under state law. 
    Petitioners contend that the statue violates both the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause and the Commerce Clause. 
    We find it unnecessary to evaluate the merits of the taking claim because we hold that even if the rails-to-trails statute gives rise to a taking, compensation is available to petitioners under the Tucker Act and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment are therefore satisfied. 
    We also hold that the statute is a valid exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. 
    The decision is unanimous. 
    Justice Oâ€™Connor has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join.
