    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Equal Access to Justice Act generally requires the United States to pay reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a non-tort civil action if the position of the United States is not substantially justified. 
    The question in this case is whether the substantial justification component of that statute applies at the fee stage of litigation, the so-called fees for fees question. 
    For three reasons we believe that it does. 
    First, the fee stage of the case is part of the overall civil action. 
    Indeed, if the fee stage of a case were not part of the civil action, then a prevailing party could not recover attorneys fees for that phase of a lawsuit at all. 
    Second, Congress limited the liability of the United States for attorneys fees to those instances where the position of the United States was not substantially justified. 
    Nothing in the text of the statute renders the United States automatically liable for attorneys fees at any stage of the lawsuit, at the merits or at the fee stage. 
    And third, the best reading of the text of the act, and the one that best serves its purposes, is that the substantial justification requirement applies at the fee stage of a lawsuit. 
    The fee stage and the merit stage are conceptually distinct, the legal issues involved are quite different, and the United States can and often does take different positions in fact and law at each stage of a lawsuit.

    Justice Kennedy 
    Well, what is there in the statute which justifies our making the distinction between the merits stage and the fee stage? 
    You have mentioned fee stage very adroitly now six times, I've noticed. 
    Aren't we going to hear that there is no basis for that dichotomy?

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, it is that point where the parties really disagree, and it is that point that I was about to address right now. 
    Let me do so. 
    And let's start with the text of the statute. 
    And when you look at the statute we think you first have to look at the forest and not just the trees. 
    The reason is the very existence of an attorneys fees statute is significant. 
    It modifies the American rule; it's a partial waiver of sovereign immunity. 
    What a fee statute does is create a new cause of action for a plaintiff and impose a new form of financial liability on the United States. 
    In fact, the version of Section 2412 of the Judicial Code that existed before the EAJA was adopted expressly exempted attorneys fees from the costs that could be awarded against the United States in a lawsuit. 
    The statute itself, therefore, creates an entirely new claim that is separate from the dispute on the merits. 
    Now that is not, we think, a novel proposition. 
    This Court's cases, beginning with its 1982 decision in White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, have recognized that the fee stage of a lawsuit involves different issues, and is--

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Well, that is one way to break the statute down. 
    It would be to decide that the merits and... excuse me, the liability and relief stages are discrete. 
    And if the United States was not substantially justified at one stage but was at the other, then a party would get attorneys fees only for that stage where the United States was not substantially justified. 
    There is an even simpler way to break down the statute if you wanted to. 
    What you could... if you look to the statute it requires a party to file a fee request within 30 days of the entry of a final non-appealable judgment. 
    You could draw the first line right there.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    The one... there is... there will be a category of cases where there is a difference, and that is this category. 
    If a lawsuit ends in a settlement... and the statute uses that term to describe when a lawsuit ends, so it contemplates that a lawsuit can end in a settlement. 
    The settlement may be a consent decree. 
    The consent decree may contemplate that there is future litigation down the road over questions such as whether the United States lived up to its obligations under the decree, whether the decree should be modified or whether the decree should be entirely vacated. 
    In that sort of circumstance you have a relief part of the action, if you will, that extends well into the future. 
    Generally we think you can collapse the two, because in the vast majority of cases what a person is going to be claiming is, for example, an entitlement to benefits that were wrongfully withheld. 
    When the United States pays over those benefits, that's the end of the case as far as what that party was trying to get. 
    Where you have a lawsuit that is going to extend into the future, for example in a prisoners lawsuit where he claims that the law library at a Federal prison was not adequate and a consent decree is entered, you are going to have then litigation extending into the future. 
    And we think in that case you would have perhaps three lines, not... not the two.

 But you also have a dispute over the amount of benefits, maybe you get credit for past months or you don't... you often get that kind of a dispute. 
 And on that issue the government's position was substantially justified. 
 Does the plaintiff get fees for that part of the litigation?

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    The legal rule would... in that case would rest and give primary emphasis to that portion of the statute which says the fee request has to be made once the final non-appealable judgment is entered. 
    That's an interpretation of the statute, and that is a legal rule. 
    It wouldn't simply leave it up to the discretion of the district court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="418.388" stopTime="436.885">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I would think Hensley would... the Hensley case would support some sort of distinction whether or not you make a formal break down between two sections of the case. 
    Doesn't Hensley say that the fee award, even to a prevailing party, has to be tied to the parts of the case in which the prevailing party actually won?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="436.885" stopTime="538.084">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, and Hensley, as we explained in our opening brief, would be authority for looking at the statute that way. 
    The prevailing party inquiry that is made under Hensley is the one that is normally made under most fee statutes. 
    This statute is unique. 
    It also adds not only a prevailing party... not just a prevailing party inquiry, but it has a substantial justification inquiry. 
    And we think the statute can logically be read so that the two should be made virtually simultaneously. 
    You can apply the two to the same stages of a lawsuit, and therefore you could decide whether someone prevailed at a particular phase, and even if they did, whether we were nonetheless taking a reasonable position at that stage, either the agency or the United States in court. 
    And specific provisions of the act we think also show that the attorneys fee stage is clearly a separate stage of the lawsuit. 
    Before a court can award attorneys fees it has to make an inquiry into a variety of different issues that arise only at that stage. 
    Those questions typically involve the inquiry whether or not a party was a prevailing party, whether that claimant is eligible for a fee award, whether the number of hours that were spent on the case were adequately documented and are otherwise reasonable and whether there is present in the case a special factor justifying an award of fees in excess of the fee cap, which, due to inflation, is now about $100 an hour. 
    Even if the only inquiry that the court makes at the fee stage is whether the position of the United States was substantially justified, that inquiry, too, is distinct from the one that is made at the merits. 
    As the Court held in the Pierce v. Underwood case, the question at the merits is whether the government was correct, while the question under EAJA at the fee stage is whether the government's position, although incorrect, was nonetheless reasonable.

    --Your Honor, my answer to that is a practical one. 
    That in the vast majority of cases a court is going to be able to decide all of those inquiries at one time. 
    It will be able to decide whether a plaintiff was a prevailing party, whether the United States was substantially justified, if not, whether the inquiry into the hours and fees should be done and whether the fees requested are reasonable, and whether the position the United States took at the fee stage was also reasonable.

    --No, or before the court of appeals. 
    We think before the court of appeals would be the more natural way to do it. 
    Because, for example in the Seventh Circuit case that rejected the automatic rule, that was a case where the decision was from the NLRB to the court of appeals. 
    Now, there was no district court in that context. 
    The request went back to the court of appeals. 
    And the court of appeals had to make this sort of inquiry. 
    Now, the court of appeals there rejected the automatic rule and found that we were substantially justified in taking the position that we did.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --What we're complaining about is this. 
    When the United States receives a fee request you have to take a position on that request. 
    And any further litigation, we think, from that point on, if we are reasonable in the positions we take, should not be paid entirely by the government for both sides. 
    Now, oftentimes if the request is reasonable the government wouldn't oppose it, and there wouldn't be any fee litigation. 
    But it is our position that if there is litigation over the amount of fees someone claims, that that is litigation at a divisible, discrete and separate portion of the lawsuit, and the substantial justification requirement--

    I am still puzzled about this bright line, because it seems to me that there are fee requests and fee requests. 
    Some are rather conclusory and some are very detailed. 
    And if you got a fee request that was very, very detailed, took many, many hours to get it together, you would say that was compensable. 
    But if they send in one that just kind of in general described what the various associates had done, and without... and you thought you had to take their depositions or do discovery to find out exactly what was covered, is that compensable or not, responding to your very reasonable inquiries about we want a little more detail here?

    --It's possible. 
    And if a court thinks that there's going to be time wasted, then it... a district court, which is certainly interested in processing its cases efficiently, will be able to do so in that type of manner. 
    If the substantial justification question is a question of law that can be examined by looking at a statute or some other cases, the district court might believe that is the way... the best way to start out. 
    Once I have made that inquiry, that may end it. 
    The court may also say but to be safe I may also want to look at some of the other objections in order to avoid having to do this again.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    They only have 30 days to do it, so it is not as if someone can prepare, you know, the same way that you can for litigation on the merits. 
    And perhaps if they spend that time at the outset that may reduce the need for litigation further down the road. 
    But if they decide to present a novel claim, and we had some in this case. 
    The award in this case of attorneys fees was $1.2 million. 
    It is one of the largest attorney fee awards that was ever handed down under EAJA. 
    And the district court gave Respondents a 15 percent enhancement above their hourly rates, which in some cases were already above the cap set by the statute, because of factors such as the emotional hardship suffered by Respondents' counsel. 
    Not by Respondents, but by Respondents' counsel. 
    Now, we thought we had a reasonable objection to an enhancement on a basis like that. 
    And it was our... and matter of fact, not only did we think we were reasonable, the court of appeals agreed with us. 
    So it is our view that the Congress did not intend to chill the government from taking those sorts of positions. 
    I mean, the reason that it adopted the statute the way it did was to serve two masters. 
    It wanted on the one hand private parties to be able to vindicate their rights in court, and on the other hand to ensure that it wouldn't chill legitimate exercise of government enforcement responsibility. 
    Well, one of the responsibilities the government has is a fiduciary duty to the agency involved, from whose budgetary appropriations EAJA awards are made--

 Mr. Larkin, you are going to do it issue by issue? 
 I mean, that sounds like a pretty reasonable objection that you described, especially since you won on it, but maybe you took some other unreasonable... while you were at it, maybe you objected unreasonably to some other of the elements of the fee award. 
 Now, would the time spend defending the unreasonable objections be compensable? 
 In other words, are you going to divide up the whole fee appeal into its various issues?

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --You could. 
    There are two ways of doing it. 
    That would be one way, which is consistent with what the Chief Justice mentioned is the prevailing party approach under Hensley. 
    I mean, if they don't prevail on an issue, they shouldn't be entitled to fees for litigating that issue at all. 
    And you could, therefore, break it up that way. 
    Another way to do it is... would rely on the sort of substantial justification in the main approach that Your Honor wrote about in the Underwood case. 
    What you would do is look to the issues where we lost overall and see whether we nonetheless overall had a reasonable position. 
    Now that... how you conduct that inquiry is not before the Court in this case, and the lower courts really haven't spent a great deal of time discussing it. 
    All you have to decide here is that we are allowed to make an argument that we were substantially justified, that we were reasonable at the fee stage. 
    How you want to break it down doesn't have to be decided here, but there are, as I said, those two approaches.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Yes. 
    It's like saying... it is the same as the inquiry now a court has to do, in a way, as to whether we were substantially justified, where we lost under the APA, and the APA standard is whether we were arbitrary and capricious. 
    But let me give you an example. 
    Suppose the court of appeals rules against us on the substantial justification issue by a two to one vote. 
    It seems to me that our position that we were reasonable is evidenced by the fact that one of the judges in the court of appeals voted for us.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to begin by taking up Justice White's point on the fees accrued in litigating the fees, because that goes to the heart of what this statute is about. 
    Congress clearly intended to make fee litigants whole, to the extent that they could under this statute, by awarding them their fees not only for the underlying merits, but for the fees in litigating the fees. 
    Not to do so would undermine the purpose of the act, because it would establish an economic deterrent that this Court noted in Sullivan v. Hudson should not exist. 
    In this case, and our case here I think amply demonstrates the problem, we need to look no further than the statute itself. 
    The statute talks about substantial justification and the position of the United States in terms of the government's underlying conduct, as well as their litigation position. 
    The government studiously avoids the 1985 amendments to this act, because those amendments make it crystal clear that the government's position is not tenable here. 
    In our case, in 1981 the government engaged in activity by incarcerating 2,000 people, and then not publishing a regulation that their own counsel advised them to do a the agency level, clearly were not substantially justified. 
    We then have spent, since 1982, seven years, almost eight years now, litigating solely the fee issue. 
    Congress could not have intended, and clearly said so in the 1985 amendment, to allow us fees for the underlying litigation, but then allow the government to--

    Well, Mr. Kurzban, wasn't our decision in Commissioner against Jean several years ago, wasn't that part of this case?

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Yes, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, that wasn't fee litigation, was it?

    No, Your Honor, it was not.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1671.922" stopTime="1676.157">

    So the merits have also been litigated during this period of time.
speaker="ira_jay_kurzban" startTime="1676.157" stopTime="1698.272">
    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    That's correct, but the government's position has not been advanced one iota since that litigation. 
    Because the reality is that the Haitians were released, and the government came to this Court, and in Your Honor's opinion you noted specifically that the government conceded in this Court, and the dissent noted that for the first time the government conceded that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1698.272" stopTime="1714.099">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Just a minute, Mr. Kurzban. 
    The reason I asked you the question was because I got the impression from what you've said that all the litigation in this case since 1981 had been over fees. 
    And I thought that was a mistaken impression.
speaker="ira_jay_kurzban" startTime="1714.099" stopTime="1788.413">
    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor. 
    But the fee litigation did begin in 1982, and we did file our first fee petition in 1982. 
    It is true that there was other litigation as well, but they... they went forward simultaneously. 
    And it is also true, and the point that I wanted to make is that that other litigation would not have been necessary if the government had made the concession that they made in this Court, which is that their regulations and statutes were neutral and nondiscriminatory. 
    The government's argument also, in many respects, tortures and certainly strains the language of this act. 
    To take Justice Kennedy's point, there is nothing in this statute that indicates that fees should be separated into different aspects of the litigation. 
    The statute talks of fees in the civil action. 
    To reach the government's position in this case, this Court would have to amend the statute not once, but twice. 
    You would have to amend it to say that fees and substantial justification are determined at different stages of the litigation, which the statute does not say, and you would have to read out, as the government does in their brief, the question of substantial justification with respect to the government's underlying action.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    Absolutely. 
    And that is why we think that the government's concerns here are purely hypothetical. 
    The government's description of absolute fee shifting, the government's description that they would have to pay untold fees, is completely unreasonable and unrealistic. 
    What we are saying is substantial justification, consistent with the statute, like prevailing party in Hensley, is a threshold determination. 
    Once that determination is made, just as in Hensley, then it's a matter of the district court's discretion as to what is a reasonable fee. 
    And on the facts in this case, for example, to the extent that the government won in the court of appeals and to the extent that we then submit other applications for fees for those, the court... the district court judge can take that into consideration and make a determination that we are not entitled for X number of dollars for pursuing one issue that the government won on, but we are entitled to others. 
    What we are saying is not that the district court doesn't have broad discretion, because I think that was the point of the statute, but that the government shouldn't be allowed to come in and allege different issues, as they are suggesting here, at different phases, the substantial justification threshold. 
    They have all the protection they need under a Hensley rationale with respect to what a reasonable fee is. 
    And the statute specifically contemplates that, because the statute says in the appropriate sections, in Section (1)(C) and in Section (2)(A), that plaintiffs are entitled to a reasonable fee. 
    In Section (1)(C), to the degree that the plaintiffs are unreasonable in prolonging the litigation, at whatever phase of that litigation they are involved in, they are entitled to no fee. 
    So that the district court is intended to be that party to make these decisions. 
    And I think it is clear--

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    On those issues, under Hensley, under a reasonableness test, yes, we would not be entitled to it. 
    And I think that is what really meets all the government's concerns here. 
    And those concerns are also consistent with the legislative history of this act. 
    And I think the clearest example of that, Your Honors, is the case with respect to litigating the fees. 
    The average case, the actual case that comes before the courts is where a fee is generated of only $4,500. 
    The government, I think, as Justice White was pointing out, the government can then litigate. 
    And we assume the government in many instances may be reasonable. 
    They may lose, but they are very good lawyers, they can fashion very reasonable arguments. 
    And in the process of doing that they can run up enormous fees, far beyond the average fee in an Equal Access to Justice Act case. 
    And that fee is $4,500; 90 percent of the fees in Equal Access to Justice Act cases are less than $3,000. 
    So if the government has an interesting issue, as they did, for example, in Sullivan v. Hudson, where the lawyer as a matter of record had to drop out of the case, because the government took that all the way to this Court, where the government has an interesting issue and they wish to pursue it all the way to the Supreme Court, the fee litigant is going to be discouraged from taking those kind of cases. 
    And the thought of Congress here is we want to encourage people to take cases. 
    We want to make sure that they don't feel that there is a tremendous risk that down the road the government will litigate against them for... for years to come, as they have in this case, and... and wind up with enormous fees that the party cannot pay.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Well, assuming the hypothetical, and obviously we don't want to concede that, but assuming what Your Honor is saying is correct, I think the answer is that no, the substantial justification threshold would not apply, because it would defeat the very purpose of the act for the very reasons that you have suggested. 
    Which is it would allow the government to litigate issues endlessly. 
    It would give them a weapon that would serve as an economic deterrent for litigation. 
    I... I'd like to address just one more point in closing, which is the Russell v. Heckler point, which the government suggests is a compromise position. 
    We would submit to the Court that, as the government concedes that that position is not well grounded in the statute itself, this statute is absolutely clear, and technical defenses and Russell v. Heckler types of defenses are just inapplicable. 
    They are in effect an attempt to amend the statute. 
    To amend the statute, number one, when it is not necessary, because Hensley and the reasonableness test address all those issues. 
    But secondly, they are clearly an amendment of the statute because they allow the government to make certain litigation arguments separate from the agency's underlying conduct. 
    And the Court, in 1985 in... I am sorry, the Congress in 1985 indisputably said that you cannot separate those; that you must look at the agency's underlying action; and that you can't let lawyers come into court, whether it is a technical defense, whether it's a Russell v. Heckler type of defense, whether it is any other kind of defense, and make the argument that because their litigation position is reasonable, that that is sufficient. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of Paul J. Larkin, Jr.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="2316.708" stopTime="2377.882">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    And I will make only two points. 
    First, the '85 amendment doesn't undermine in any way our interpretation of the statute. 
    Congress addressed a problem in '85 dealing with the front end of litigation. 
    What we are dealing with here is a problem that arises at the back end. 
    There is no logical reason to assume that Congress wanted the same answer to apply in both circumstances where there are different problems. 
    And if anything, the 1985 amendment actually helps us in a way, because it indicates that there are two positions that have to be considered: the agency's and the lawyer's position that is taken in court. 
    The second point I would like to make is just that we think the statute has to be read so that the substantial justification provision and the civil action have to be read reasonably, because the statute uses them in the same sentence. 
    If the fee stage is not part of the civil action, then they don't get fees for fees at all. 
    If the fee stage is part of the civil action, then the substantial justification provision has to apply. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions, I have nothing further to add.
