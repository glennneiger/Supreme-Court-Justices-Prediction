    We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7351, Jeffrey Alan Walton v. Arizona. 
    Mr. Ford.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="28.483" stopTime="178.460">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents three issues regarding the constitutionality of aspects of Arizona's death sentencing statute. 
    I'd like to begin by briefly addressing the last of those that is discussed in our briefs, the constitutionality of the provision of Arizona law that makes murder a capital crime if it is committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved fashion. 
    That issue is before the Court, of course, in another case, Lewis v. Jeffers, which will be argued I believe immediately after the recess the Court is about to take. 
    And it is our submission, as it is the submission of the Respondent in Lewis, that the case is directly controlled by this Court's decision in Maynard v. Cartwright, holding almost identical language in the Oklahoma statute to have failed to control sentencing discretion. 
    The... Professor Rosen, who wrote the seminal article on this... it was relied on in Maynard and also the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals en banc and the Adamson case, have also reviewed the Arizona statute, its application, in great detail, and come to the conclusion that there is no way in which it can be distinguished from the Oklahoma statute in Maynard. 
    Since Adamson, of course, the Arizona court has gone even farther. 
    This case was decided by the Arizona Supreme Court after Adamson, and that court continued to take steps to stretch the breadth of this aggravating circumstance even to greater lengths. 
    In this case, affirming a trial judge's finding of the aggravating circumstance which was unadorned by any explanation of what the trial judge's understanding of what the circumstance meant, which followed arguments by the prosecution with regard to an interpretation of the statute which the Arizona Supreme Court rejected. 
    And in this case, the Arizona court took the final step in a series of decisions by which it ultimately said that the fear of a robbery victim, a person who is not necessarily even going to be the victim of a homicide, the uncertainty of... as to the person's fate is sufficient to constitute suffering which is sufficient to constitute cruelty, which is sufficient to make out the statute and qualify a defendant in that kind of a case for a sentence of death. 
    And in this case, as we pointed out in our--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="178.460" stopTime="203.211">
    Justice Scalia 
    That... that is different from... from just in the course of a robbery suddenly shooting someone. 
    I mean, I... I suppose holding someone hostage in... as occurred in this case, debating with your accomplices whether you will kill him or not while he's lying there on the ground... I suppose that is something in addition to merely killing somebody in the course of a robbery, isn't it?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="203.211" stopTime="243.286">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --Well, I can't refrain, Justice Scalia, from pointing out that there isn't, of course, any testimony that such a debate occurred. 
    That... that debate is a product of the rhetoric of the Arizona Attorney General and the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    According to the witness, the discussion was over what the person would be tied up with. 
    But, again, to take the Court's hypothetical, there are always those facts that can be said to distinguish one homicide from another, to constitute as... cruelty because every homicide, as the Court has pointed out in Maynard, is... could be said by a reasonable person to be cruel. 
    You can always find a fact in any case that says, well, that's a cruel fact. 
    That's different than some other cases.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    It seems to me that that's exactly what the court of criminal appeals did in Maynard and in actually in some ways worse because in a court of criminal appeals in Maynard we had a jury instruction... we knew what that jury was told constituted heinous, atrocious or cruel. 
    In this situation, because we don't have... we have bench trials in Arizona, and that's an issue I want to come in a second... we don't know what definition was used. 
    The trial judge never said, I'm applying this definition. 
    And the Arizona Supreme Court has said in the past and very critically in the Rumsey case that came to this Court that it is not the sentencing body, that it is a reviewing body, and the discretion that is to be confined I think is the discretion of the sentencing body that can be controlled by rules set in advance and not just changed on a case-by-case basis as cases are analogized to facts that may have been incidental in a prior crime and then become the sine qua non of this factor. 
    I would like to spend some time talking about the first issue in this case. 
    It is a classic conflict between the expansion of judicial power at the expense of the traditional role of one of our democratic institutions, the criminal trial jury. 
    The State of Arizona here is claiming that it may transfer the most basic core functions of the trial jury to a judge... take it away from the jury where it has been for at least 300 years in English and American law, by simply changing its label. 
    By calling it an aggravating circumstance. 
    And if that can be done with the facts that are in their present statute and any fact... they've given no standard by which this Court would say what facts can be changed by that labeling devise and what cannot.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Well, the Hildwin case, Your Honor, I think takes us right to the threshold of what the framers were trying to preserve for the jury. 
    But the Hildwin decision, as I understand it, involved a unanimous recommendation by a jury under Florida law that implied that that jury had unanimously found at least one and probably many aggravating circumstances.

    --That's correct. 
    But the fact... the eligibility is established by law. 
    The due process clause says no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law. 
    In our Federal system the states, by their statutes, say what is necessary for a deprivation of life or a deprivation of liberty. 
    This Court, and under the Fourteenth Amendment in this context and others, then looks to the process by which those facts are found to see whether the due process clause was complied with.

    They don't necessarily have to specify which they found, but they must be instructed that they have to find all of those elements that make up one of those two theories. 
    And that's very much what I understand the Court in Hildwin to have said. 
    The jury in Hildwin was able to recommend death unanimously as it did because it found some aggravating circumstances.

    That's correct. 
    And the court has to identify those circumstances, as I think Justice Stevens explained in his Barclay opinion and the Spaziano opinion with regard to what Florida law is about. 
    Those findings are designed and were put in the Florida statute for judicial review. 
    They... by statute they are not exclusive factors.

    How is that distinguished for Sixth Amendment purposes?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="863.276" stopTime="908.952">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --Because an element of the offense is a discrete atomic sort of... that's why I think maybe we call them elements. 
    That's where the metaphor may have come from. 
    It is... once it is proven, you are eligible. 
    It is the factual prerequisite to the determination of punishment that may be made by a judge. 
    But the factual eligibility is concretely defined in the law of Arizona, concretely defined in the law of homicide throughout the country and in the very many other states that don't have this kind of a provision in Arizona. 
    In Florida, the... the facts are... are quite distinctly described as considerations. 
    And the question is whether there is a sufficient number. 
    And they are balancing elements and they are not something that is... is set out by the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="908.952" stopTime="916.874">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, a judge can make findings that the considerations existed, but a jury has to make findings that aggravating circumstances existed.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="916.874" stopTime="924.378">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --No. 
    The jury has to make the findings that make the person eligible by law for the imposition of the sentence. 
    Once this judge--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="924.378" stopTime="928.932">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but no. 
    Those... those findings in Florida made the person eligible for a sentence by law.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="928.932" stopTime="978.699">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --Well, as I understand, the way that the Florida statute is written, Mr. Chief Justice, is that those factors are there to be identified so that appellate courts can look and avoid arbitrariness by saying, here are the factors that are... were in this case; we're looking at comparative cases; we have reasons stated on the record. 
    Those kinds of reasons for judicial opinions, very much like the reasons of the Defendant's... the Enmund factors that the Court said that could be found by a judge in Cabana are not the kinds of core elements... and I guess my point is that, sure, the line is a thin one here, but if you... there is no line whatsoever between the Arizona statute and Justice Stevens' hypothetical in McMillan where the states say the crime is assault and it's an aggravating factor, that it was a homicide or the person died or it was premeditate or it was intent to rape--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="978.699" stopTime="989.470">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Arizona still has a series of elements in the offense that the jury has to find to make you come within a definite first step of a capital sentencing process.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="989.470" stopTime="1089.936">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --They have the traditional first-degree murder. 
    But the Arizona legislature has decided that absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt of certain discrete limited factors by evidence which is admissible under the rules of criminal procedure, another difference between that and Florida, that is a... both a necessary and sufficient condition for imposition of the death penalty... also different than Florida... and it shifts the burden of proof to show... to the defendant to show that he should not be sentenced to death. 
    Now, if that is not an element of the offense, I don't know what is, and the State of Arizona has never answered the question what is in the many arguments we've had over this. 
    There is no other line that anyone has suggested could be drawn. 
    And this line was fought over. 
    It was put in the Constitution twice because of just this kind of usurpation by the Crown in England under the Stuarts where they tried to take away from juries the power, say, in William Penn's case, to determine whether or not the... the facts were true. 
    And they tried to penalize juries for returning false verdicts. 
    The cornerstone basis of the right to jury trial was that the judge could not say that the fact was false. 
    And if the judge can say that the fact is false, why shouldn't juries be held in contempt? 
    Why shouldn't verdicts be directed, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his Carrella opinion? 
    This is the bedrock definition of the jury trial that was never in debate. 
    The debate in 17... in the 18th century was whether or not juries should decide the law, whether or not juries should sentence.

    The... there are... most statutes that I'm aware of, including Arizona's, have a jury decide whether or not the person is a habitual offender. 
    There are statutes, and there are a variety of these things, Justice Kennedy. 
    And the Court has said, as it did in McMillan, there may not be a bright line here, but the... most cases... statutes that I know of are like the one in McMillan where you're not creating eligibility for a qualitatively new kind of punishment; you are simply raising a minimum term. 
    You're doing the kind of thing a parole board might do later on because the legislature has determined that you're eligible to have your liberty deprived up to a length of time based on these other facts, and this is just an additional fact that may raise the minimum. 
    In McMillan the Court was very explicit in distinguishing that from... and especially from this where you're talking about a qualitatively different punishment, one that is described by a different word in the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And you can't get there, under state law, unless these facts are proven. 
    And if... and those, I think, are very different kinds of facts than... than most recidivism statutes.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --The... when... yes, exactly, because that's what the Court said in Spaziano. 
    When you're talking about sentencing, you're talking about... and the Court has said in Ramos... that you're talking about a different kind of issue. 
    You're talking about one that involves everything. 
    A reasoned moral response to a person, his whole life, to an event, to all aspects of it in a way that cannot necessarily be predicted. 
    That's why you don't cabin these into a... into a particular set of facts. 
    But when you talk about a crime, you're talking about specific individual facts that can't be substituted for that are limited by law. 
    And that's exactly what Arizona has done in its different characterization of what is an aggravating circumstance than Florida has. 
    Now, Florida case law has evolved partly, as Justice Stevens' recognized in Barclay, under this... under what... under the impression of what this Court required, to look more like Arizona. 
    But the statute, I think, that Patterson v. New York says, a statute is what describes the minimum. 
    And the statute is what I think the Fourteenth Amendment looks like. 
    Another way to look at this, I think, is the way the Court has in the due process cases where the state has created a liberty interest. 
    You have... we have a finite number of factors that specifically controls discretion. 
    Then a liberty interest attaches and the question... the due process attaches, and the question is what process is due. 
    And the frames of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments this Court has said when it's incorporated... has said that they understood the process due for a fact that is prerequisite to a deprivation of life or liberty to be trial by jury. 
    And they said it twice, and they said it explicitly. 
    Now, that jury may vary in... in its composition. 
    There may be various rules about whether its unanimous vote is required or not. 
    Those kinds of things have changed, and they changed before the Constitution was written. 
    They were in flux in 1791. 
    That's why this Court has allowed variation under the Fourteenth Amendment and in 1868. 
    But this never changed. 
    We have our... our citations run from 1458 up through the turn of the century and even in cases that... as recently as last summer. 
    And those citations have never changed, and that understanding of what trial by jury applies to has never changed. 
    And unless there is some law, unless there is some line that the state has never described to us that lies between these facts and... again, Justice Stevens' worst case hypothetical in the McMillan case, then I don't know what is going to be left potentially of the Sixth Amendment in the third century of the Constitution because juries are sometimes a little intractable. 
    They're inconvenient, they don't necessarily go along with what the government wants, they don't necessarily find the facts the way the... as Justice White pointed out in Duncan... that the more practiced and professional eye of a judge would like it, and people often try and make incursions on their power. 
    And that was a major source of the battle that left... the legal battle that led to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States protecting that right in criminal cases. 
    And I don't know where the line is if it doesn't encompass this kind of a statute, which in every characteristic but label is the equivalent of the elements of a crime. 
    I would like to save some rebuttal time, so unless there's other questions--

    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    Petitioner raises essentially four contentions challenging their... the constitutionality of the Arizona death penalty statute. 
    I too would like to begin in inverse order as they appear in the brief and begin with the constitutionality of the Arizona Supreme Court's definition of the aggravating circumstance of especially heinous, cruel or depraved. 
    In Maynard v. Cartwright, this Court reviewed Oklahoma's aggravating circumstance of especially heinous, atrocious and cruel and found it to be unconstitutionally vague because the Oklahoma courts had refused to define the term to inform the sentencing jury what facts it was... must find to impose death. 
    It was this lack of definition that left the sentencing body with the discretion to impose death whenever it desired, in violation of Furman. 
    Arizona has not left its corresponding terms of especially heinous, cruel or depraved aggravating circumstance so ill-defined. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court has taken the terms and divided into two separate categories. 
    The existence of facts which would support the definition in either category will find... will make it so that the aggravating circumstance is found. 
    The first prong of the test is cruelty, and it's proved when the state presents beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim consciously suffered mental anguish or physical pain prior to death. 
    The second category is heinousness or--

    In... under the state due process, the state must notice those aggravating factors it intends to pursue and specifically list the facts which would support the aggravating circumstance. 
    And that was done in this case. 
    The state gave notice that it was going to seek the aggravating circumstance of especially heinous, depraved... cruel, heinous or depraved, under both prongs of the test.

    The trial court stated that it found the circumstance... it stated it found cruel, heinous or depraved. 
    It said... did not say that it rejected either of the fact patterns proffered by the state. 
    On independent review the Arizona Supreme Court looked at the facts offered by the state and found by the trial court to exist based on its finding and said that only on one set of facts did it support the cruelty finding, that of the mental suffering prior to the shooting, which was alleged by the state in the sentencing memorandum.

    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    That was the second area I was getting... that the problem with Maynard is that the sentencing body, the juries, were not given instructions on what the definition of the law was to inform them what facts were necessary to be found. 
    Trial courts do not have that same problem. 
    If there arises a dispute in the facts, the trial court can certainly go to the law library and read past cases to see what fact patterns have fallen within or without this test. 
    A similar issue raised in the brief is that the definition given these two prongs of the Arizona test are unconstitutionally broad. 
    In order to address overbreadth, this Court must begin its analysis with Lowenfeld v. Phelps.

    That is correct. 
    But the person was not death eligible unless he had an aggravating circumstance. 
    The aggravating circumstance simply mirrored an element of the offense. 
    Our cruel, heinous and depraved circumstance, while it may apply to many that are convicted of first-degree murder, it certainly does not apply to all of them. 
    Therefore, it does serve a narrowing function.

    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    It is no different than any other aggravating circumstance. 
    I would like to now address Petitioner's contentions regarding whether or not the Constitution prohibits the state from imposing an evidentiary burden of proof on a criminal defendant to show mitigation. 
    In order to understand this argument, the Court needs to understand exactly what analytical process the state goes through to prove or to show the death penalty in Arizona. 
    The state proves the aggravation. 
    At that point in time the defendant may present anything he or she desires in mitigation. 
    The trial court is simply to consider those facts that it believes to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence and assign those facts it believes to be true mitigating weight. 
    The trial court then weighs and balances the aggravation and the mitigation and determines whether the mitigation is sufficient to warrant leniency. 
    The only burden placed on the defendant is that if he wants the trial court to consider facts and mitigation he must produce sufficient evidence for the court to believe that they are probably true. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court independently reviews the record to determine if all of the mitigating evidence was considered and then independently determines if they are... if the Arizona Supreme Court is convinced that the death penalty is the appropriate sentence.

    How... how do we get facial attacks on statutes where we're not talking about the First Amendment?
speaker="paul_joseph_mcmurdie" startTime="2303.934" stopTime="2317.859">
    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    Because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that our statute was unconstitutional on its face in that... in that case. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court has refused to go along with that decision. 
    Therefore, we are in a conflict.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Do you think that our capital punishment jurisprudence says that you simply go through all the provisions of a statute in the abstract regardless of how they may have been applied to the particular defendant in question and says, well, this is good, but this isn't?

    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    --No, I do not believe that's the case.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you're... you're defending this because the Petitioner makes it?
speaker="paul_joseph_mcmurdie" startTime="2343.844" stopTime="2496.589">
    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    I'm defending this because the Petitioner makes it and based on the Ninth Circuit's opinion there's a deadlock that cannot be resolved unless this Court resolves the issue. 
    In getting back to a related argument of Justice White's question, this Court in Franklin v. Lynaugh said that residual doubt to the ultimate penalty... or, I mean, the ultimate guilt/innocent was not constitutionally required for the trial... for the sentencing jury to consider. 
    If the trial court determines that it does not exist, the residual doubt on whether or not it was true should not be constitutionally mandated for the sentencer to consider. 
    This does not offend the common notions of decency as stated in Patterson v. New York where traditionally affirmative defenses in mitigation was placed upon the defendant to prove the existence of such evidence. 
    Rational moral response requires that the sentencing court, in equating whether or not the death penalty to be imposed, rely on evidence that it has determined probably exists and not mere speculation. 
    It ensures consistency and it ensures reliability. 
    The final issue that I wold like to address this afternoon is whether or not Arizona has a mandatory or presumptive death penalty. 
    I'm not going to take up this Court's time in going through all of the arguments proffered by the sister states of California and Pennsylvania. 
    The State of Arizona agrees with the position taken by those states in those cases that are presently pending before this Court. 
    There is a difference, however,... a slight difference... between those cases and this case in that in Pennsylvania and in California the question is what a reasonable juror would... or, jury would determine how it is to apply the instructions given. 
    In this case, the trial court may look at the law and review all of the cases to determine if there is an appropriate sentence based on the mitigation and the aggravation posed. 
    Regarding the first issue, that of judicial sentencing, it's the state's belief that this issue has been resolved in its favor in Hildwin and Spaziano. 
    Therefore, Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has specific questions about that issue, I've concluded my remarks.

    Mr. Paul Joseph McMurdie 
    --Your Honor, you can simply... in my state you can simply look at the purpose based on the legislative history of the aggravating circumstances. 
    In 1972 when Furman came down, the Arizona legislature convened a session to create in effect a new sentencing procedure. 
    They did not change the substantive law. 
    In 1974 this statute was enacted, adding aggravating factors. 
    In 1978 they revised the Code and then simply then redefined the crime. 
    But it did not change the underlying basis that these factors are what the Arizona legislature has determined is the objective standard by which the sentencers are to channel or to narrow those that would be death eligible. 
    But it has never changed or altered the elements of offense as defined by the Arizona legislature for first-degree murder. 
    This is not an attempt to circumvent the Sixth Amendment right.

   Rebuttal of Timothy K. Ford
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2767.278" stopTime="2850.144">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Justice Kennedy, you won't find the word... the phrase "elements of the offense" anywhere in the Arizona statute. 
    They don't say anything as an element or not that has to be decided by what the thing does. 
    With regard to the defendant's having actually committed the actus reus, pulling the trigger, the aggravating factors that were found here under the statute are... and, unfortunately, one of the things that happens when you get sloppy with judge sentencing is, if you'll notice, the judge's findings are not even in the words of the statute. 
    But the statute says the defendant committed the murder in a heinous, cruel or depraved fashion, especially; the defendant committed the murder for expectation of something of pecuniary value. 
    That's a paraphrase. 
    And, of course, the essence of the judge's finding that this was heinous... or at least the Arizona Supreme Court's finding... gloss on in. 
    What they say was heinous about it is that Mr. Walton pulled the trigger. 
    That's what made him eligible. 
    That is the issue. 
    Every issue, actus reus, mens reus, down the line, is converted. 
    And the answer that Arizona gives is the one that they have here. 
    We call it sentencing. 
    And when we call it sentencing, the Sixth Amendment vanishes and the right to jury trial vanishes. 
    I don't think that that is a sufficient answer. 
    I don't think that the phrase "element of the offense" or "aggravating circumstance" is a talisman. 
    This talisman is the phrase "trial by jury". 
    And that is what the Sixth Amendment framers I believe had in mind on this kind of question. 
    The--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Rather, if you just left it to the judge and didn't specify what particular criteria would determine the severity of the sentence... let's say you leave it to the judge to pick between a fine and imprisonment, which also differs in the terms "life, liberty or property"... it's the difference between property and liberty... you could leave it entirely to the judge. 
    So long as you don't specify how it will make the difference, it would be perfectly okay to have the judge make factual findings, on the basis of which he makes that judgment.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2881.715" stopTime="2882.048">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --It's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2882.048" stopTime="2894.606">
    Justice Scalia 
    But your position is that if the state says that you can only give imprisonment if you find a certain fact, then it has to come out of the sentencing judge and go to the jury. 
    Even in a noncapital case.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2894.606" stopTime="2911.049">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --That's right. 
    Spaziano I think says that those sentencing determinations can be left to the judge. 
    That was done in... in the 18th and 19th century. 
    There's no question about it. 
    And the fact that modern statutes require judges to give reasons why they did it so there can be appellate review, that doesn't change it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2911.049" stopTime="2915.203">
    Justice Scalia 
    Why does it cease to be a sentencing determination simply because you specify?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2915.203" stopTime="3121.180">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Well, when you specify... because there... the line between where we are and Justice Stevens' hypothetical and McMillan vanishes because there no longer is any answer left except we called it sentencing, therefore, it's okay. 
    Every other answer is... has fallen. 
    And this Court has let the states, I think by Hildwin and Spaziano, go as far as it possibly can preserving that core of Sixth Amendment trial by a jury. 
    But if it goes this additional step, the core is gone. 
    And there is nothing that anyone has suggested at any level... and we've argued this many times... that will be left to say, states, these things are what the framers meant in 1791 when they said there will be trial by jury in criminal cases. 
    As there was... as it was fought for in William Penn's case and John Peter Zenger's case where the judges tried to say, oh, well, the libelousness is a question of law, we'll take that away, the Colonists said no. 
    And Zenger's case was very much in the minds of the framers of the Constitution and Blackstone and the people who they were looking to understand why... it tells us why they put those words in the Constitution twice. 
    The... the cruelty question, the third question... the heinous, cruel and depraved... if the Court looks at the previous Arizona cases, they will see this evolution. 
    Those facts... no previous case had found, as this one does, that the uncertainty as to fate is enough to constitute cruelty. 
    It was a fact that in some of these previous cases people had been uncertain. 
    But what happens when you have the appellate court with no specific touchstone, it evolves and the things that were incidental in one case become important in the next case, become sufficient in the third case. 
    And if you'll look at the cases the state has relied on, you will find that. 
    Think if... where... where would we be now under the... under the Arizona's rational... had... there had never been an intentional homicide here had there been a police chase while they were on their way out into the desert and there had been a crash. 
    Mr. Powell would have died in the course of a felony even though unintentionally and he would have feared for his life. 
    It would have been cruel. 
    They have expanded it that far. 
    If you had the classic law school example of walking into the convenience store and pulling the store and pulling the gun and the person has a heart attack. 
    That fear would be painful. 
    The rhetoric of a prosecutor could say, imagine the pain, imagine the fear, imagine the agony. 
    The defendant should have known he would have done this. 
    And that rhetoric can drive the rage that people feel when these homicides occur and cause death to be imposed in a fashion that is not regular and arbitrary. 
    And we have cited many, many cases where Arizona judges, like the prosecutor in this case and like the trial judge in this case, at least by his ruling, did not understand that this was the rule. 
    If you look at the prosecutor's argument, he wasn't talking about what the Arizona Supreme Court ultimately held. 
    He had a completely different idea of what the statute meant. 
    Our... the middle issue which I did not address is not here as an abstract issue. 
    There was serious mitigating evidence in this case which was brought forth in a very haphazard fashion because we live in an imperfect world and because judge sentencing in Arizona is a very informal process. 
    But we know Mr. Walton had a terrible childhood, he had a drug abuse history, he was living in poverty at the time of this crime. 
    All that came in in a very vague undefined fashion and there is no indication it was given any weight by the trial judge. 
    We have to assume that was because of the statute. 
    Thank you.
