    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning No. 89-1775, Gary Peel v. the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois. 
    Mr. Ennis.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Petitioner's letterhead contains the truthful and verifiable statement of fact that he has been certified as a civil trial specialist by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, a highly respected organization of judges and lawyers whose certification program has been endorsed by the--

    How do we know that? 
    That it's highly respected?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="45.112" stopTime="65.942">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, there is no dispute in this record that the National Board of Trial Advocacy is a reputable and nonbogus organization. 
    It is sponsored by seven national organizations, including the National District Attorneys' Association, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. 
    On its governing board sit many judges, including judges in--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="65.942" stopTime="67.658">

    And this is all in the record, I take it?

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --This is in the record below. 
    Yes, that's correct, your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="70.077" stopTime="70.660">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Uh-huh.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="70.660" stopTime="71.912">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    There is no dispute about that fact.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="71.912" stopTime="79.250">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Does the state recognize it as a... as an organization that certifies specialists?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="79.250" stopTime="117.625">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    The state does not recognize any organizations to certify specialists. 
    In the hearing below, the state took the position that it was not going to argue one way or another about whether the National Board of Trial Advocacy provided meaningful information or not. 
    The state was willing to assume that the National Board of Trial Advocacy certification did provide meaningful information to consumers. 
    Nevertheless, the state thought that in order to prevent bogus organizations from springing up, the state needed to have a complete categorical ban, a prophylactic rule which prohibited all statements of certification.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="117.625" stopTime="124.397">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How much of your case, Mr. Ennis, depends on the stature of this particular organization?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="124.397" stopTime="142.109">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    In this particular case, Your Honor, it does not matter at all because this Court's decisions made clear, beginning with R.M. J and followed in Shapero and Zauderer, that the states cannot place an absolute ban on potentially misleading speech.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="142.109" stopTime="154.000">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So if it were the Sangamon County Trial Lawyers' Association with a membership of about six in rotating musical chairs, that would still be true, so long as the statement were not false?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="154.000" stopTime="184.020">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We do not quarrel with the ability of the state to regulate, to make sure that statements by certifying organizations do provide significant and meaningful information to consumers. 
    The state could adopt a regulatory scheme and could prohibit statements about certification by bogus organizations. 
    That is not this case. 
    Illinois has not tried to distinguish between bogus organizations and meaningful organizations. 
    Illinois has attempted to prohibit--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what if it isn't a bogus organization but some little two-bit club that the lawyer truthfully says he belongs to and they've recognized him and given him some certificate? 
    That's fine, I take it. 
    And--

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, how does an average consumer know anything at all about this organization? 
    They're not even listed in the telephone directory in some cities. 
    And how is the average person to have any feeling at all about what that organization represents?

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Well, Your Honor, as the FTC will argue as amicus, Petitioner's statement, like statements like physicians that they are board certified, does provide meaningful and relevant information to consumers. 
    Consumers, if they want, can go to the trouble to find out what being a board certified--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="263.305" stopTime="270.391">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, so it really does make a lot of difference, contrary to what you said earlier, what kind of an organization this is.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="270.391" stopTime="277.814">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Your Honor... Justice White, I think if the state had a regulatory process, it would make a lot of difference whether--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="277.814" stopTime="296.293">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you seem to say it does make a lot of difference. 
    It has to provide... this statement has to provide meaningful information. 
    And I take it from what you've said in your answers that whether it provides meaningful information or not depends on what kind of an organization it is. 
    This two-bit club? 
    No. 
    But this group, yes.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="296.293" stopTime="346.125">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Yes, Your Honor, that is correct. 
    Our position is, and I think it is the same test, the same rule this Court applied unanimously in R&amp;J and later in Shapero and Zauderer, that the state cannot have a blanket prohibition on potentially misleading speech, as a speech by a bogus organization might be, if there are regulatory mechanisms which could eliminate the deception. 
    Here there are at least four, and maybe five, simple and reasonable regulatory mechanisms that Illinois could use to eliminate any potential for deception by bogus organizations. 
    First, Illinois could itself on an ad hoc basis approve certifying organizations as meeting its standards for what provides meaningful information. 
    Second, Illinois could--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="346.125" stopTime="356.747">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say that's a simple step, Mr. Ennis. 
    But actually, that could involve a fairly substantial commitment of resources on the part of the Supreme Court of Illinois, couldn't it?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="356.747" stopTime="388.802">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Justice Rehnquist, it certainly could provide... require some commitment of resources, but less, I think, than the administrative burden this Court has already upheld in the other attorney advertising cases. 
    In Zauderer and in Shapero this Court upheld requirements and suggested that in order to regulate potentially misleading speech the state could require filings of all speech with the state and then on a case-by-case basis the state could make a decision about whether that particular speech was or was not misleading.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="388.802" stopTime="389.268">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if--
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="389.268" stopTime="389.654">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    That is a greater--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="389.654" stopTime="391.170">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --if this is commercial speech.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="391.170" stopTime="392.606">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Justice White?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="392.606" stopTime="410.318">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if this is commercial speech that these... that he's putting out? 
    Is your rule of applying a narrower... or the requirement that they use a less-restrictive means is that really... will that really get you very far if it's [inaudible].
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="410.318" stopTime="427.828">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I hope so because I'm relying principally on your opinion for the Court in Zauderer, which was a commercial speech case, which squarely ruled that states cannot prohibit potentially misleading information if reasonable regulatory measures would suffice to cure the deception. 
    Zauderer--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="427.828" stopTime="429.162">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is this commercial speech?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="429.162" stopTime="524.741">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, we argue in our briefs that this speech should be categorized as fully protected speech rather than commercial speech. 
    But because this case can and should be decided on the narrower ground that even if it is commercial speech it cannot be categorically prohibited, I will rely on the arguments in our brief to support the broader ground. 
    Let me make clear that Illinois has not argued that its prophylactic ban is a reasonable accommodation between First Amendment interests and the state's interests. 
    Instead, Illinois has argued that no accommodation is necessary because there is no First Amendment interest to be protected. 
    That argument is based solely on the conclusory assertion, without any support in the record, that all statements of certification or specialization will inevitably and necessarily mislead consumers. 
    But as the Federal Trade Commission will argue as amicus, Petitioner's statement, like the statements by physicians that they are board certified, provides relevant and meaningful information that will promote informed consumer decisions. 
    Petitioner's statement, according to the FTC, is not even potentially misleading, and even if it were, there are numerous reasonable regulatory measures that would eliminate any potential for deception. 
    And Illinois has not even bothered to consider those regulatory measures, much less prove that they would not suffice.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Ennis, what does the certification here tell the consumer? 
    Does it tell the consumer that the lawyer has had a good win/loss record in cases in court?

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, not at all. 
    And that is a quite different situation. 
    A good win/loss record, a statement about a good win/loss record, might imply success, that the attorney will be able to be successful for the client. 
    This is not that at all.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --I think, Justice O'Connor, that the average person might reasonably think that certification by the National Board of Trial Advocacy would imply something about experience in civil trials and a knowledge of basic procedures in civil trials, which is exactly what NBTA certification does. 
    In order to be certified by NBTA, as the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled, NBTA certification is based upon a rigorous and exacting set of requirements which require proof of five years of practice in civil trials, including at least 30 percent concentration in each year in civil trials; lead counsel in 15 completed trials, including five jury trials and at least 45 full trials days; lead counsel in an additional 45 litigated matters; 45 hours of continuing legal education in civil trial practice in the previous three years; confidential peer review by both judges and lawyers of the attorney's trial abilities; a substantial trial brief; and a day-long written examination which tests knowledge of evidence, ethics, substantive and procedural law and trial tactics.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But, as you've said, Mr. Ennis, that's... that's really just incidental. 
    I mean, the principle you're arguing for is that even if that weren't all true, the state's absolute ban would not be any good. 
    They... it would be up to the state to show that this was not a reputable organization, isn't that... that's your point.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.

    That is a different factual circumstance from this case because it's a statement of opinion. 
    "I am the best lawyer in the East Coast. " 
    is a statement of opinion. 
    It is not verifiable. 
    A statement by Peel that he has been certified by the National Board of Trial Advocacy is a statement of fact.

    No, I think it's certainly not verifiable, Your Honor. 
    I'm sure that some other lawyers in Sangamon County would disagree with that assessment. 
    It's a very different circumstance to say a statement of opinion,

    Well, why don't you go ahead. 
    Maybe I can follow you.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="869.931" stopTime="1026.215">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Let me... let me point out that the three ways in which Illinois claims that Petitioner's speech could be misleading are not self-evident and they are not based on any empirical evidence, any study, or any expert opinion that that speech would be misleading. 
    Illinois first suggests that a statement of certification will imply that the state itself has certified or has endorsed the certification. 
    But as the FTC will argue, it is implausible to believe that consumers will think certification by the National Board of Trial Advocacy is certification by the State of Illinois. 
    Furthermore, even if there were evidence that Petitioner's statement was potentially misleading in that way, there are many simple regulatory measures to cure that misleading statement. 
    First is a simple requirement for a disclaimer. 
    Illinois could require attorneys to say on their letterheads that certification does not mean or imply certification or approval by the state. 
    Second, there could be ad hoc approval of certifying organizations. 
    Third, there could be approval of certifying organizations pursuant to preexisting standards and criteria that Illinois would find to be meaningful. 
    Fourth, there could be case-by-case review of all such statements, as this Court found would be a reasonable regulatory burden in Zauderer and in Shapero. 
    And finally, the states themselves could engage in certification of attorneys, as 11 states have done. 
    Under NBTA requirements, if a state provides itself for certification of attorneys, NBTA will not certify an attorney until the attorney has first been certified by that state. 
    In all these ways the entirely speculative fears of Illinois could be cured through reasonable regulatory measures. 
    With respect to the burden point that you raised, Justice Rehnquist, let me simply say that in Zauderer the Court said, quote, 
    "Our recent decisions involving commercial speech have been grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial information is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpful from the misleading and the harmless from the harmful.

    So if... putting aside opinion problems, if there were... if they were on the letterhead, you know, graduated first in his class from the University of Chicago Law School, more hours on his feet in a courtroom than any other lawyer in Sangamon County and a few other things, what would... the state would have to allow that and its only remedy would be to investigate those allegations one by one?

    --But our argument is that the state could adopt reasonable regulatory mechanisms to review that kind of speech as well as this kind of speech, which is a very different kind of speech. 
    The state in Illinois has not bothered to do that. 
    And as this Court's decisions made clear, Illinois cannot impose a prophylactic ban on useful speech simply to, quote, "spare itself the trouble" of distinguishing between the harmful and the harmless. 
    I'd like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal, if I may.

   Argument of Steven J. Marzen
speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1107.084" stopTime="1159.052">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    On behalf of the Federal Trade Commission I'd like to make two submissions this morning. 
    First, that Mr. Peel's certification claim, and other claims like it, are valuable commercial speech. 
    And second, that certification claims cannot be entirely prohibited by the state on the record in this case. 
    First, information about lawyer certification is valuable commercial speech. 
    The First Amendment protects commercial speech on the theory that it performs a valuable function in allocating resources in a free-market economy. 
    Among other things, such information helps consumers pick out desirable goods and services. 
    The First Amendment theory, as applied to this case, would indicate that information about lawyer certification would help consumers pick out lawyers who are particularly competent to handle their particular problems.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1159.052" stopTime="1164.706">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Marzen, how would this particular certification on Mr. Peel's letterhead help consumers?
speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1164.706" stopTime="1184.101">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    Well, if a consumer had a problem that involved litigation, they could look for someone who is certified as a civil trial specialist by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, in comparison to another practitioner who didn't have any certification or also didn't, through looking at Martindale-Hubbell or something else... didn't have any indication that he had courtroom experience for example.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1184.101" stopTime="1189.905">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You think that would... that a lay person would understand the significance of that certification?
speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1189.905" stopTime="1316.755">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    A lay person certainly isn't going to know that NBTA certification means all the specific things that are required to get the certification. 
    He's not going to know that it requires 15 trials, five jury trials or a minimum of 45 days trial experience. 
    At the same time, the vast majority of people in this courtroom probably wouldn't know what tests a product had to go through to get an Underwriter's Laboratory certification. 
    He or she will know, however, that the certification implies that the attorney has passed some tests, some tests with bite, that are related to the subject area of the certification. 
    And that's... that's the sort of implied claim that a certification statement makes. 
    And in that case it's true. 
    I detected in the questions posed to previous counsel some limits as to what... or some questions as to what is left for the states if you recognize the ability of an attorney to say that I'm a certified civil trial specialist, or any other certification claim. 
    And in the Federal Trade Commission's view, substantial leeway is left within a wide zone of reasonableness for states to continue regulating. 
    Within the certification area, for example, if the organization had a musical chairs requirement or just had the requirement that one pay a certain fee, a state could of course prohibit that in their entirety. 
    The reason... the theory would be that those claims do not... or that the requirements of the certification organization have no relationship at all to the implied claim the consumer would read from the certification. 
    In addition, depending on what the state reasonably finds the reasonable consumer to understand the claim to be, the state could prohibit claims by certification organizations with insufficient requirements. 
    For example, in this case if the State of Illinois had found that a reasonable consumer assumes that a civil trial specialist has at least tried one case, they could forbid organizations from... or forbid people from making claims that they are certified as a civil trial specialist by an organization that didn't have those particular requirements.

speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1320.839" stopTime="1347.424">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    Well, what one has to realize is that this is sort of a dynamic process. 
    There were... there was a time in the medical profession and in... in certain products where they were just starting certification. 
    And in those cases, consumers did not... you know, the certification took more and more meaning over time. 
    For instance, the Sunkist Grower's Association... you know, who knew... who knew what Sunkist meant when it first started out? 
    It was a group of people, you know, growing oranges. 
    Over time, though, it became--

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    --That's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1357.114" stopTime="1378.345">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And... and simply because you can allow any organization to certify something... Good Housekeeping or United Labs, or whatever else for light bulbs... it doesn't mean you have to do it for the process of justice, for which counselor are... are members of the bar of the court.

speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1384.665" stopTime="1417.136">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    --No. 
    It depends on what the assumption of reasonable consumers are. 
    For example, if one... over time there may be more and more state certification and certification by more and more private entities. 
    Just as in the medical profession, you may evolve towards higher and higher standards. 
    Unless you allow the process to get started, however, you're never going to reach that higher goal. 
    There's no question but that you're correct that legal services are far more complex, and claims that you wouldn't allow in the areas of products, for example, would not be allowed in terms of legal services.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1417.136" stopTime="1426.576">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It isn't just a matter of complexity, it's a matter of it being part of the process of justice that the Illinois Supreme Court and other courts are charged with meting out.
speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1426.576" stopTime="1572.986">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    I understand that it's part of the process of justice, but in fact allowing people to... to announce and to disseminate information about certification is in the very highest traditions of the standards of the bar in maintaining and improving the quality of advocacy and all other forms of service. 
    As the study cited on page 2 of our brief in this case indicate, more than 90 percent of the people who suffered serious property damage, employment discrimination or had problems with their landlords, don't go see a lawyer. 
    Those exact same studies reveal that the principal barrier is because people don't know that there is a particular... can't find a particular lawyer who they feel is competent to deal with the problem. 
    That same... another study cited in that... our... our same FTC submission indicates that in certain copy tests with 276 individuals, that when you give them information about professional qualifications they... the intentions to go out and obtain legal services increases. 
    Justice is a very, very important goal. 
    But the information that is... that would be disseminated as a result of this case is in... would actually help promote justice. 
    It would help people who have serious legal problems vindicate public and private rights. 
    And that is a significant interest weighing in the balance on the other side. 
    The state, of course, has substantial leeway to prohibit false or misleading claims but it's not necessary to reach... to have a prophylactic ban to do so. 
    In fact, in this particular case the State of Illinois had already means to achieve all of its goals with... with far less intrusion on First Amendment costs. 
    Specifically, the claims of the State of Illinois are that someone reading Gary Peel's certification statement and any other certification statement would think that there was an implied claim of either state sponsorship or an implied claim that Gary Peel is a superior trial lawyer. 
    If those claims are accurate, which we disagree for the reasons in our brief and I can elaborate on, the State of Illinois could have had a prophylactic disclaimer saying that certification is not by the state and infers no claim of expertise. 
    That would have cured any potential confusion or deception, and it would have not trenched nearly on the First Amendment interests that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1572.986" stopTime="1595.852">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it would have pretty well killed the usefulness of the... of the letterhead, too, wouldn't it? 
    Perhaps you say that Illinois should be pleased with that result. 
    If you... I mean, are you really winning much for Mr. Peel if you say he can put this on but after it the state can require him to put it, this is not a certification by the state and it does not import any claim of expertise?
speaker="steven_j_marzen" startTime="1595.852" stopTime="1609.428">
    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    --Not as much as I'd like, Justice Rehnquist. 
    It's better than a flat ban on any certification statements and it would probably require the attorney to make the certification information useful to specify more about what the standards of the certifying organization were.

    Mr. Steven J. Marzen 
    That's... we... okay. 
    The two points I would make is that it's less intrusive. 
    We would... I entirely agree with your point, though, that on the facts of this case the state should not be allowed to require a disclaimer. 
    Disclaimers are extremely valuable when there is some potential--

    It's not a lie at all. 
    The express statement in this case is: I have been certified as a civil trial specialist by the NBTA. 
    That is absolutely true. 
    There are implied claims, however, which may or may not be intentionally made that could be confusing or deceptive. 
    When one is dealing with such implied claims, the experience of the Federal Trade Commission is that you can address an implied claim by an express statement that is... an express statement that that is not what I meant.

    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    There's three reasons why Petitioner's letterhead is misleading. 
    The first and most obvious reason it's misleading is that to the reader Petitioner's statement implies that his certification is sanctioned by the state or a governmental authority when there is no question on the record that it is not.

    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    Your Honor, we... we believe there's three reasons why it's misleading. 
    The first, that it implies sanction. 
    The second, that it impinges upon the inherent authority of the Supreme Court of Illinois to set qualifications for the practice of law in Illinois.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1892.023" stopTime="1895.141">

    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    And the third reason is that on this record Petitioner's claim is an unverifiable claim as to the quality of services he provides. 
    Petitioner in his reply brief even admits or argues that a disclaimer in this case would be highly burdensome, and it is our argument that a disclaimer that would have to be created to vitiate the three components of why Petitioner's statement is misleading would have to be so long, so detailed as to be even--

    We believe that an attorney could indicate that he was a civil trial advocate or a civil trial attorney, because that statement would not be misleading for the three reasons that we've set out. 
    That does not imply state sanction, that doesn't set a qualification for the practice of law. 
    In other words, a reader could not look at that statement and think, but for that certification the attorney could not practice in that area of the law.

    You have to look at Petitioner's letterhead. 
    Specifically, on his letterhead he has the name of his law office, his address, his phone number, and to the left in the same size print he lists his name, then he lists his certification claim.

    I was looking at the third trying to say the second. 
    And, finally, that it is an unverifiable claim of quality, especially to the general public. 
    This is not dry cleaning or, as the attorney for the FTC said, oranges. 
    There is a tremendous difference between oranges and providing legal services. 
    There's a tremendous difference between providing legal services and the medical profession. 
    We believe in this situation that these misleading statements can be prohibited for the three reasons that we have stated. 
    The history of advertising in Illinois shows that the court was highly concerned with the free flow of nonmisleading commercial information to the public. 
    Also, attorneys were given a wide range of opportunity to advertise. 
    The rules relating to advertising are set forth in our brief, and they show that the Illinois court has given attorneys in Illinois every opportunity to advertise in every medium. 
    The only real restriction is that their advertising not be misleading. 
    In this case we ask that this Court affirm the well-reasoned, thoughtful and well-analyzed decision of the Illinois court that Petitioner's letterhead, the statement on his letterhead, is misleading. 
    In this case, Your Honor, Petitioner's... and I feel that I must mention these... has also raised two other issues. 
    The first being that Petitioner's statement is not commercial speech. 
    We have two short arguments on this point. 
    The first argument is that Petitioner has waived this argument. 
    Petitioner did not raise this issue at any time below. 
    During five levels of review Petitioner never mentioned that his speech was not commercial speech.

    Did anybody say it was?
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3314.651" stopTime="3331.363">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    Well, in fact, Petitioner urged the lower levels to consider his speech as being commercial in nature by defending his statement by using precedents developed by this Court in commercial speech cases.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3331.363" stopTime="3337.533">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But did the state ever argue that the standards governing commercial speech be applied in this case?
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3337.533" stopTime="3388.116">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    In response to his arguments in response to his defense that his statements under the attorney advertising decisions of this Court were proper we did, yes, retort that these decisions do apply in this... in this situation because we believe that it's obvious that even if this Court finds that Petitioner hasn't waived this argument, there is no question that Petitioner's statement is commercial speech. 
    Petitioner's definition that statements which explicitly propose a commercial transaction are commercial speech is meritless. 
    This Court's decisions hold that statements which explicitly and implicitly propose a commercial transaction constitute commercial speech.

    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    Well, the record shows--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It didn't promote... isn't that what the... the only thing in the record is he wrote to the Disciplinary Commission.
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3397.738" stopTime="3416.683">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    The record shows that Petitioner uses this letterhead during the ordinary course of his practice of law and that he sends his letterhead out to clients, past and present, and other attorneys who he admitted refer a majority of his business to him.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3416.683" stopTime="3422.086">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see. 
    And so part of the misleading public were other lawyers who were also terribly confused by this.
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3422.086" stopTime="3443.264">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    Well, or their clients who the lawyer says: Here's this letterhead; this is the guy I think you should hire. 
    Finally, Petitioner makes two arguments that the Illinois court's prohibition of his statements violates the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Again, I will refer the Court to our brief to these arguments. 
    We feel that there is a rational basis--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3443.264" stopTime="3484.239">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Suppose that the only way the state claimed this was misleading was that it implied a... approval by the state that this was... organization was sanctioned by the state or this certification was sanctioned by the state. 
    And suppose, as I think you probably agree, that that could be negated, that inference by a... something on the letterhead to the contrary. 
    Would you think the state would be required to use that means to cure the problem rather than this blanket ban?
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3484.239" stopTime="3489.209">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    --Following your hypothetical, Your Honor, it may be possible.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3489.209" stopTime="3501.867">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it may be possible. 
    Do you think the state is required to... in this commercial speech area to use that... that less intrusive way of curing the problem?
speaker="william_f_moran_iii" startTime="3501.867" stopTime="3511.824">
    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    Still, though, what the inherently misleading terms "certified" and "specialist" to the public, and the public's unsophistication concerning delivery--

    Mr. William F. Moran, III 
    --of legal services, we believe that it would be almost impossible to create an effective disclaimer in this case. 
    In summary of our argument, the rules in question clearly advance the state's substantial interest in providing the free flow of commercial information to consumers of legal services. 
    In reading the rules, the comments to the rules, the legislative history and the opinion, it is clear that the Supreme Court of Illinois takes seriously its responsibility to regulate the practice of law in Illinois and to protect the public from misleading information. 
    The Illinois court's finding that Petitioner's statement is misleading is supported by thoughtful well-reasoned analysis. 
    The policy supporting the court's rule is sound. 
    Petitioner's statement can constitutionally be prohibited. 
    We request that this Court affirm the lower court's decision. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="3577.267" stopTime="3630.401">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    In response to questions from Justice O'Connor and Justice White, the state acknowledged that Illinois does not have a blanket rule which prohibits attorneys from saying they concentrate their practice in civil trials, even though there is no objective standard in Illinois for what concentrate means. 
    Instead, Illinois reviews those claims under a different rule, Rule 2101, which prohibits any misleading claim on a case-by-case basis. 
    That is exactly the rule we are arguing for here. 
    There is no more justification for a blanket ban on this statement than there is for a blanket ban on statements that Illinois... in Illinois that attorneys concentrate their practice. 
    To the contrary. 
    Concentrate means something. 
    In NBTA certification it means the attorney has spent at least 30 percent of his time in the previous five years in civil trials. 
    Justice Kennedy asked a question about--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3630.401" stopTime="3685.201">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Ennis, I've been thinking about your assertion that the source of confusion said to exist by the Illinois Supreme Court is that they think that certified means certified by Illinois. 
    I don't think that's what the court said. 
    I think all the court said is when you say certified by the NBTA the average person would think that that is a permission to practice, that the NBTA is somehow an official organization. 
    The Supreme Court doesn't say that they'll think that constitutes Illinois approval. 
    But when you say NBTA&gt; ["] and then under that 
    "licensed by the State of Illinois. " 
    I think the... the... the unsophisticated person reading that might well think that... that indeed the more important thing is that you're certified by NBTA, which is, for all they know, some official organization. 
    Why isn't that correct?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="3685.201" stopTime="3722.710">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --First, Your Honor, that speculation. 
    There is no evidence in this record that there is that potential for deception. 
    Even if there were such evidence, that also could be cured by a simple requirement of a disclaimer statement or by the other regulatory measures we have addressed. 
    So, as in Zauderer, because the potentially misleading statement can be cured through regulation, a prophylactic ban is impermissible. 
    Justice Kennedy raised a question about expertise. 
    In Zauderer the Court ruled that states, quote, 
    "may not prevent an attorney from making accurate statements of fact regarding-- "
