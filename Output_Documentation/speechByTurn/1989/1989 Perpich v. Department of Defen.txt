    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-542, Rudy Perpich v. Department of Defense. 
    Mr. Tunheim?
speaker="john_r_tunheim" startTime="10.772" stopTime="125.164">
    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case concerns the constitutionality of the Montgomery Amendment which removes from states the power to withhold consent to foreign training of the National Guard because of objections to location, purpose, type and schedule of that training. 
    It's codified at Title 10, Section 672(f) and was enacted in November 1986. 
    The Montgomery Amendment effectively nullifies clause 16, and before I begin, let me just reference the three most relevant constitutional provisions, because they are referenced a lot in my argument. 
    Article I, Section 8, clause 12 gives Congress the power to raise and support armies, clause 15 gives Congress the power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions, and clause 16 gives Congress the power to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, but reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. 
    Now, the Montgomery Amendment effectively nullifies clause 16 by removing states' powers to consent. 
    It permits unlimited Federal authority over training, and leaves no control or authority to the states. 
    The Montgomery Amendment is unconstitutional because it violates the plain language and meaning of clause 16. 
    It overturns long settled understandings of the relationship among the clauses of Article I, Section 8, and it upsets a carefully established framework eliminating a fundamental part of the checks and balances as established by the framers.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And it is your position, I suppose, that the part of Section 16 that it violates is that that says it is reserving to the states the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress?

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Unorganized... the unorganized militia is defined under federal law, and I think the laws of most states. 
    It's simply defined as every able-bodied person between the ages of 18 and 45. 
    It's a pool of individuals that's available for military service at some point in time, but they are not trained. 
    They are not part of an organized militia in any sense.

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Because the militia under the Constitution can be called forth into the federal service. 
    That's an essential element of the definition of "militia" in the Constitution as understood by the framers. 
    And the defense forces by federal law cannot be called forth into the federal service. 
    They can be used only within the borders of the states, and as a practical matter they... they simply don't exist. 
    They were created to... to... to help within states during World War II when National Guard members were in the federal service for the duration of the war.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But... but they don't exist, I... I suggest to you because the states haven't chosen to call them into existence. 
    What... Mr. Tunheim, what do you make of footnote 5 in the Solicitor General's plea where he says 24 states have statutes providing for a state defense force or a state guard that is separate from the National Guard, listing Minnesota law appears to recognize a state guard in addition to the National Guard, citing the statute? 
    I think these later questions have all been directed toward this kind of thing, and you keep turning around to speaking of militia. 
    What do you make of footnote 5?

    Mr. John R. Tunheim

    --The... the provisions in Minnesota law allow for creation of this home defense force, and it... it was used during World War II. 
    It's not currently used at all, even though the provisions remain on the books. 
    But again, the defense forces are carefully referred to as not militia because that... that constitutes a different definition within the Constitution. 
    It calls into play the requirements of the Constitution, and... and it really... they have carefully not identified the defense forces as organized militia because of that.

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    --Well, I think the answer to that lies in the purpose of the dual enlistment system, Justice Kennedy. 
    It was created in 1933 for... for one particular reason, and that was so that the... that National Guard units as trained units could be federalized quickly in case of an emergency or wartime situation. 
    The problem in World War I was that... that the National Guard units were disbanded. 
    The individuals were drafted as individuals, and then once they were in the federal army the federal government tried then to recreate these... these organized units. 
    That was the purpose of dual enlistment, to provide for a quick mobilization of organized units. 
    It had nothing to do with training; and also, it was expressly limited to use during a national emergency or wartime. 
    Congress, in 1933 when dual enlistment was created, in no way intended to divest from states the training authority over the National Guard, and Congress didn't understand in 1933 that it was divesting such training authority. 
    There wasn't federal training of the National Guard that went on at that time.

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Justice O'Connor, I think the term "discipline" clearly means the standards to be applied to training. 
    The framers, in fact, feared this very problem of confusing the authority of discipline and the authority of training. 
    One of the delegates proposed that... that the training reservation to the states simply be eliminated because, of course, the states would have that authority because it wasn't being expressly given to the new federal government, and the delegate was talked out of it because of the fear that discipline might someday be read and interpreted broadly enough to include training. 
    The framers were very concerned about maintaining an effective state control over the militia except during times of emergency, and the reservation of training clause really has to be viewed in that light along with the appointment of officers clause.

    Does the militia clause speak of... of emergency?

speaker="john_r_tunheim" startTime="996.963" stopTime="1099.780">
    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Not in clause 16, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    clause 15 sets forth three purposes for which the militia can be called into the federal service. 
    Those are, in essence, emergency situations, and the State's argument is also that Congress has the power under the army clause during an emergency to call the... to federalize the militia, to call the National Guard into the federal service based on this Court's decision in the Selective Draft Law cases. 
    Now let me just explain in a nutshell the State's position. 
    As I said, when... when the nation faces a national emergency, it is our view that Congress has complete power to federalize the National Guard under the army clause, or Congress can utilize the three purposes in clause 15 for calling the National Guard into the federal service. 
    In either case, state authority is completely removed; but, absent those circumstances, states retain basic control over the National Guard, particularly with respect to training which is expressly reserved to states. 
    This position harmonizes the army clause with the militia clauses instead of reading out of existence the militia clauses, which is the ultimate effect of Respondents' position. 
    The National Guard is really a quintessential state organization. 
    The state militias, which every state had and has had since the beginning, were organized into the National Guard pursuant to Congress' power to organize the militia. 
    They have remained state organizations of vast importance to the states throughout the years. 
    The National Guard is relied on very heavily--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

    Well, it did, but the language doesn't say that.
speaker="john_r_tunheim" startTime="1237.035" stopTime="1421.840">
    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    Well, I think... I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in reviewing the Selective Draft Law cases you really can't separate that case from the context in which it was written. 
    The issue in that case was whether the militia clauses somehow immunized an ordinary citizen from mandatory conscription during a world war and, of course, the answer to that was no. 
    Congress would not have any power to raise an army without conscription other than by volunteers. 
    That case did not involve the National Guard. 
    It did not involve the organized militia. 
    It did not involve the states or the states' reserved power under clause 16. 
    It did not involve training, either peacetime or wartime. 
    In fact, the Solicitor General in arguing that the Selective Draft Law was constitutional assured the court that had had no impact on peacetime training of the National Guard which was reserved to the states. 
    And that really in that case if you look at it properly, there was no conflict between the clauses because the militia clauses do not give rights to individuals. 
    They give rights to Congress and to the states in this balance of power that... that the framers created. 
    To the extent that I think Selective Draft Law cases is relevant here, they recognize that Congress has very strong powers during wartime and during emergency situations. 
    Congress understood that in 1933 when it codified this emergency power into... in... and created the dual enlistment system. 
    The court also warned in the Selective Draft Law cases against an interpretation that would effectively destroy the militia clauses. 
    I think that case has to be limited to the context in emergency, and that's completely consistent with the states' position in this case that Congress does have the army... army clause power during an emergency to federalize the National Guard. 
    Let me talk just briefly about... about the framers and what they intended here. 
    To the framers the militia were really the citizen soldiers belonging to the various states, an issue of... of extreme controversy and... and substantial debate in the summer of 1787 was how much control to take away of the militia, to take away from the states and give to the new federal government. 
    Many wanted to retain plenary state control over the militia because they greatly feared, the framers greatly feared, the effect of a large standing federal army, and they believed that state control would be a very important... a very important check on misuse of the federal... federal army. 
    They rejected Alexander Hamilton's proposal to make the militia totally subject to the federal government. 
    They were also concerned, however, with providing the federal government enough authority during an emergency situation to be able to have access to the militia, and so they reached a compromise. 
    The militia would remain a state organization, but in an emergency for limited purposes Congress would have power to call the militia into the federal service.

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    The Constitution, Justice Kennedy, gives to states the power to train, the authority over training the... the militia. 
    Congress can prescribe the discipline so that the militias, the National Guards of the various states can work together and can fire the same weapons, can read out of the same drill manuals, can drive the same tanks or bulldozers. 
    That's Congress' power to specify the discipline. 
    But the power, the... the authority over the training, which is the precise words in the Constitution, is reserved to the states. 
    The framers thought it was so imperative to reserve this power to the states that they wrote it into the Constitution. 
    A document that writes in very little express reserved powers for states because it's a document that gives limited powers to a new federal government, it was so imperative for maintaining this control, this balance of power, the checks and balances which are inherent in the Constitution that they wrote it in, and it is the language of the Constitution.

    There's not... it's difficult to find a bright line in here between discipline and training, but I think it is that the discipline is the generalized commands that are given by Congress to the states, and the particularized application of those general commands are what training is and what is reserved for the authority of the states.

   Argument of Kenneth W. Starr
speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="1633.093" stopTime="1745.099">
    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The army clause of the United States Constitution provides in broad terms that the Congress shall have power to raise and support armies, and consistent with the breadth of the text of the Constitution this Court has broadly construed this clause and the powers that are granted under this clause. 
    The Court has described the powers granted under it as plenary, as broad and sweeping and, importantly for purposes of this case, as not limited by the militia clauses. 
    Coupled with the necessary and proper clause, there is little doubt... and we have heard today... that there is no dispute that Congress had the power under the army clause to create an entity. 
    That entity is the National Guard of the United States, and it created it as a component of the armed forces of the United States. 
    When it created the National Guard of the United States in 1933, Congress was very clear. 
    It relied expressly on this Court's World War I decisions in the Selective Draft Law cases and Cox against Wood. 
    And the theory of those cases is that to the extent that Congress exercises its powers under the army clause the efficacy, the sweep of the militia clause is thereby limited.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    --This is critical, Justice Kennedy. 
    Section 311 speaks of the national guard. 
    You're quite right. 
    What I'm speaking of is the National Guard of the United States. 
    There are two separate entities. 
    That is the thrust, that is the essence of the dual enlistment concept. 
    If I leave nothing else today, I want to leave the Court with that clear distinction. 
    An individual who serves in his or her national guard unit serves in two capacities. 
    That individual is, indeed, a state militia person, but that person also since 1933 takes an oath of allegiance under the Constitution of the United States to obey the orders of the President, and the Congress has seen fit to give powers both unto itself in its exercise of army clause powers to make use of this reserve component, and it's a critical part of the reserves. 
    The National Guard of the United States, when it goes to Honduras, when it goes as it is now-- 
    As we speak, approximately 4,000 national guardspersons are in training operations in South Korea. 
    Some of those individuals who have been involved in that exercise are from Minnesota. 
    They are not there in their militia hats. 
    They do wear those hats when they return to Minnesota and the other states, but when they have been summoned under the authority of 672(b), they are summoned in their capacity as members of the reserves of the United States Armed Forces.

    --The only control is that of the appointment of officers, clause 16, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. 
    That is to say, Congress could, if it saw fit, summon forth all able-bodied persons into service of the country. 
    It could authorize the President to do that. 
    That is precisely what the President did, and that's what Congress has authorized it to do, in providing for military training for those persons who wear their twin hats, their double hats. 
    These individuals are being trained in Honduras or South Korea or Europe or elsewhere as members of the reserves of the United States Armed Forces, and this is critical. 
    This is absolutely critical, that as a practical matter, since the 1970s, U.S. strategic doctrine is such that the use of the National Guard of the United States as members of the reserve component of the Armed Forces is critical. 
    As we outline in our brief at a time of full mobilization, 18 of the Army's combat divisions, 18 of the 28, would be National Guard of the United States units. 
    A very substantial part of the United States Air Force is the United States National Guard Air Force, the National Guard of the United States.

    I don't think there's any override, because the state interest that is involved here is a very strange one. 
    What the Governor is seeking to do is not to forbid overseas training of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
    There's no objection to their being trained in South Korea and Europe. 
    What the Governor has sought to do is to play a role in the foreign policy and defense policy of the United States, to say they should not be trained in Central America, even though troops are employed in Central America and National Guard of the United States troops are employed and were employed in the Panamanian operation, they were employed in the Grenadan operation, they were employed in the Libyan air strike, and they have been employed in all major activities of the Nation's Armed Forces since the creation of the National Guard in '33.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    --That's quite right, and that's why Congress in fact exercised army clause powers in 1933. 
    It did not exercise militia clause powers. 
    If one looks at the background of what Congress did, Congress did not say, we are exercising our rights to organize the militia, clause 16. 
    We're doing that in order to prepare for the exercise of clause 15 powers. 
    Not at all. 
    They said, we're exercising our army clause powers. 
    That's what we're exercising, and these individuals are becoming members of the reserves, of the Armed Forces of the United States.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    --Our definitional difficulties are arising by virtue of different uses of the term "militia". 
    The term "militia" as used in the Constitution, as I see it, has to do with those able-bodied persons who can in fact be summoned by the state, by the Governor... and the Governor has that power. 
    This is important. 
    The Montgomery Amendment does not... does not... even if one were to say this is the militia, the Montgomery Amendment simply says, Governor, you can't object to their training as Armed Forces of the United States on these four enumerated grounds. 
    If you need them... if you need them in Minnesota, you can keep them in Minnesota.

 I think you've said they can organize, so long as they don't run afoul of the maintaining troops clause, whatever that might mean. 
 Right?

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    That is correct. 
    They can... they can organize, but that power can in fact, it seems to me, be overridden, if Congress sees fit to exercise its clause 16 power.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    I fully agree with that. 
    [Laughter] 
    And many of those questions have been discussed at length here. 
    If one reads the Court of Appeals opinion en banc, one sees, it seems to me, a very clear and correct opinion. 
    When Judge Magill, in writing for the overwhelming majority of the en banc court, comes to the conclusion, at that part where he says, Congress was exercising its army clause powers here, and that power is sufficient to establish the armed forces of the United... to include in the armed forces of the United States, these individuals, that is the end of this case. 
    Congress' power is plenary. 
    There is no question. 
    Getting back to Justice O'Connor's earlier questions. 
    There is no question that these individuals were in federal status. 
    Whatever the limits of power, there is no question that they were in federal status. 
    Indeed, they need to be in federal status in order to enjoy federal benefits, in order to enjoy federal protections under status of forces agreements.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    I think, Justice Scalia, that, although not involved in this case, I must state that that is not involved in this case. 
    This is an extremely limited regulation. 
    This is a system of cooperative federalism that works very well. 
    It worked extraordinarily well until governors sought to play a role on the stage of foreign policy, and then Congress stepped in. 
    It stepped in narrowly; it stepped in precisely. 
    But, to get to your theory, I think that is the theory of the case in selective draft law cases.

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    When these individuals... the answer is... is no. 
    But when these individuals have been summoned to serve their country, I don't think there is any doubt that Congress has the power to pass a law that has the effect of summoning all able-bodied persons to serve their country. 
    That has the effect... and that's what Chief Justice White recognized in Selected Draft Law cases, he recognized it again in Cox against Wood, that that has the inevitable effect of shrinking the compass, shrinking the operation of the militia clauses. 
    Congress does not do that. 
    It does not do that because Madison saw it at the founding. 
    That there were protections... there were political protections, that states are represented in the Congress of the United States. 
    But in terms of pure theory, pure theory, the pure theory of Selective Draft Law cases is when it... and it stands to reason, that were we truly in a time of crisis, and the nation needed the help of every able-bodied person, then we ask the Congress--

    Mr. Kenneth W. Starr 
    The National Guard, since... that is correct. 
    To be in the National Guard of the United States one must be in the National Guard, the state National Guard. 
    There may be some individuals who are members of the National Guard but who are not members of the National Guard of the United States. 
    I understand there are a few persons in that category, but you're quite right, since 1933, an individual to sign up, to enlist in the National Guard, enlists in both.

    The essence in this case is really a dispute over what dual enlistment means. 
    And I remind the Court that these two entities are the same organization. 
    These are the same people. 
    Dual enlistment merely created a reserve force which relies completely on the states, on the National Guard, that the state organize militias for its members. 
    The Respondent tries to claim, somehow, that the National Guard of the United States and the National Guard are kind of like apples and oranges; you can switch the hats. 
    They really aren't even apples and apples. 
    They are the same apple. 
    These are the same people, and you just cannot wave this magic wand and eliminate constitutional protections, constitutional limitations, which were the essence of a compromise that the framers made 200 years ago over the control over the... of the militia.

    Mr. John R. Tunheim 
    And Congress has exercised that power, has organized the militia, and has created the National Guard. 
    That is the entity that we're talking about today. 
    Now they've gone beyond that to interpret dual enlistment, which has never been interpreted to... to eliminate constitutional protections to... to now require that... that to be done under the army clause. 
    In 1933, when dual enlistment was created, its use as a federal force, the National Guard of the United States was expressly limited to emergencies, relying on the Selective Draft Law cases. 
    When that was changed to bring the National Guard into federal training for the first time in 1952, it was done only pursuant to the governors' consent. 
    State authority over training has been consistently recognized for 200 years, until the enactment of the Montgomery Amendment.
