    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 88-2109, Kansas and Missouri v. UtiliCorp United, Inc.-- 
    Mr. Greenan.
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="13.260" stopTime="86.682">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The principal question before the Court this morning is whether or not the rule that has been set forth in Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery, and in Illinois Brick v. Illinois, that gives the claim for overcharges in an antitrust case to the direct purchaser is entirely without exception. 
    In this instance we are talking about an antitrust case involving the sale of natural gas by regulated utilities from the wellheads in Wyoming to residential consumers in the states of Kansas and Missouri. 
    We have a situation where formal cost-plus pricing is the rule. 
    We have an extensive system of Federal and state regulation that requires a 100 percent pass-on of any increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas from the wellhead to the burner tip. 
    We have in place a contract in the form of a purchased-gas adjustment mechanism, which provides that that pass-on shall be complete and that it shall be immediate.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="86.682" stopTime="104.905">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Greenan, you say the 100 percent pass-on is required from the wellhead to the burner. 
    You're saying, then, I take it, the utility corp... utility commission in the state must require that a utility pass on all of the cost?
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="104.905" stopTime="116.933">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The purchased-gas adjustment mechanism is set forth at Tab 3 of the Addendum to the Joint Brief that was filed in the Tenth Circuit, and it does... it is... does mandate that it shall be passed on.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="116.933" stopTime="118.616">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And is that a Federal rule?
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="118.616" stopTime="127.581">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    That is a state rule. 
    It is also contained in the purchased-gas adjustment mechanism promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="127.581" stopTime="132.433">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, if it were just a state rule, I suppose some states might have it and some states might not.
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="132.433" stopTime="156.130">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    No. 
    In this instance the... the interstate pipeline is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
    Their purchased-gas adjustment mechanism requires a pass through. 
    In this particular instance the states of Kansas and Missouri are... the local utility distributors are regulated by their state commissions, and there are purchased-gas adjustment mechanisms on the state level that have that same requirement.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="156.130" stopTime="165.066">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So what you are speaking then is... from wellhead to burner, is true of residential consumers in Kansas and Missouri?
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="165.066" stopTime="172.228">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    I believe that it is established in the brief of the amicus, the State of Illinois, Your Honor, that those are present in 40 states.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="172.228" stopTime="173.681">

    40 states--

    40 states.

    --by virtue of the rulings of public utility commissions?
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="176.273" stopTime="218.293">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    One particular item of interest in this case is that the states are proceeding parens patriae pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 15(c), and in that instance that they are representing residential consumers who are natural persons in their non-business capacity. 
    These residential consumers, the record is clear, do not have the ability to switch to alternative fuels, at least in the short term. 
    They have in place their heating plants, their natural gas furnaces. 
    And in order for them to make a switch to an alternative type of fuel it would be necessary to change to some other type of heating and to go through--

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    Let's put them side by side with the utility. 
    What we have to understand is that in the regulated industry the utility is not really making a profit on buying and selling natural gas. 
    It is not a product that it receives, marks up and passes on. 
    Rather, it carries it through from the point of origin to the consumer. 
    As the... testimony of Mr. David Black, who was the senior vice president and general counsel for one of the utilities says, we merely perform a transportation service. 
    We take title to the gas for the few hours that it requires for us to get it from the wellhead to the burner tip, and then we charge them penny for penny, dollar for dollar, whatever the cost is to us, and that is shown forth on their bill. 
    Now, if that is the situation, the utility then does not earn a profit on the sale of natural gas. 
    A utility makes its money by a guaranteed rate of return on its invested capital. 
    It is allowed to earn so much to return that investment, and so much by way of a return on the investment.

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    --That... that situation is unaffected by the facts of this case. 
    The point that I was making was in answer to Justice O'Connor's question as to what was the incentive here. 
    And Your Honor I think just pointed it out well. 
    In the rate-making case, the rates are established based upon what level of sales is necessary in order to achieve that guaranteed rate of return. 
    And as you have observed, if the utility sells more gas than it had expected, it keeps that. 
    If it sells less gas than that it does not achieve its rate of return. 
    So what does it do? 
    It goes back to the utility commission and it files a new rate case, and it says that our historic sales are now below what we had before. 
    We need a higher percentage--

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    I don't believe that Illinois Brick says that you can be sure that the intermediate purchaser not be harmed. 
    What Illinois Brick does say is that we do not want to get involved in the questions as to output determinations and price determinations that exist in the real world, as distinguished from the economist's model. 
    We are not going to get involved in the interplay of supply and demand forces as to what affect prices. 
    But Illinois Brick itself said if it can be easily demonstrated that the overcharge... that the direct purchaser did not absorb the overcharge, then it might be that there would be an allowance of a recovery by the indirect purchaser. 
    And that was reaffirmed by the Court recently in the observations that were made in California v. ARC America.

speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="602.954" stopTime="698.384">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    He loses some of the profit. 
    He does not pay any of the overcharge. 
    And that is the point, I think, the real point of distinction. 
    We are looking at several things with Illinois Brick. 
    We want vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. 
    We also want to see, if it is possible, that the people who were injured are compensated. 
    In this particular instance there is no difficulty in demonstrating from wellhead to burner tip that that overcharge went down the line and was paid by the people at the end of the line. 
    Now, if the utility lost profits because of a decline in sales, then that is a claim which the utility has and which the utility can make. 
    This Court has never been concerned with whether there were multiple parties in antitrust litigation. 
    This Court has never said that we are going to only allow claims for overcharges, or that we are only going to allow claims for lost profits. 
    Going back to Bigelow and Storey Parchment, all of the seminal cases on damages, the Court has recognized that there can be claims for lost profits, that there can be claims for decrease in... or increase in the amount of operating costs, that there can be claims for loss of investments, and all of these are separate and distinct claims. 
    In this particular instance, Justice Scalia, the proof will not change one iota by giving the claim to the residential consumer. 
    The utility will still have to make its claims and make its proof with regard to those lost sales.

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    --Right. 
    There are forms, referred to as Form 2s, that are filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that shows how much the pipeline passed on. 
    There are filings that are made by the local utility districts of the various state regulators... regulators that show the volumes to each class of customer and the prices to each class of customer. 
    Now, one major problem that we have here in this question of vigorous enforcement is that the utilities who brought this litigation do not represent all of the consumers who purchase natural gas that was involved in this alleged illegal price fix. 
    We have a significant number of consumers, some 50,000, maybe as much as 20 percent of the gas consumers in eastern Kansas, who purchased from utilities other than the ones that chose to bring these lawsuits.

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    I would say piggybacking is not correct, Your Honor. 
    We filed three months after the first case was filed. 
    The first case was filed in April of 1985. 
    The state case was filed in July of 1985, I believe. 
    UtiliCorp, the utility that is here before the Court, filed their case in 1985, dismissed it in 1986, for what reason only they can tell us--

    Voluntary dismissal?
speaker="thomas_j_greenan" startTime="926.529" stopTime="967.355">
    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    --Voluntary dismissal. 
    And then asked and received permission to file again in October of 1987, very shortly before these motions for summary judgment were brought. 
    Now, the defendants in the litigation claim that their claims, the claims of UtiliCorp, are time barred. 
    And indeed it appears that they do have very significant statute of limitations problems. 
    So relying upon the utilities here means, first of all, that there are any number of consumers that are not represented by the utilities. 
    And secondly, if it is the utility UtiliCorp that has this claim, rather than the attorneys general as parens patriae, those claims may well be time barred.

    The government says... the government says we don't concede that a regulator would make them give up the double and triple damages. 
    I suggest to the Court then in... in an instance where they have had a pass through dollar for dollar, where they have the guaranteed rate of return so that they can come back to have their rates adjusted within a short period of time, that it is highly unlikely that any regulators are going to let them keep that, because it will be a total windfall that should have gone to the people that paid for the natural gas.

    And more than that, it is immediate in this sense, that the local utility district reports to the pipeline each month, after it has received the gas and delivered it, what its volumes have been that it delivered to each of its class of customers. 
    And it is then, and only then, that it is billed for that gas by the pipeline, after it has made delivery. 
    So it is... it acts immediately that the local utility is billed and it bills... it bills the end-user.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: 
    I must disagree with Mr. Greenan about a number of issues, first about what the issue of Federal antitrust policy is before the Court today. 
    The issue as we see it is whether this Court will continue to consolidate antitrust damage claims in an injured direct purchaser, or whether it will cloud the clear direct purchaser rule of Illinois Brick by creating a regulated utility exception. 
    There is no need, we submit, in this case to change the direct purchaser rule, which has been clear since 1968 at least, because in this case we have over 85 percent of the antitrust damages being pursued by KPL, which has over 75 percent of the damage claims, by UtiliCorp, with about 5 percent, and by the other municipal utilities which are represented, properly so, we contend--

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    Indeed it was made. 
    But one thing that hasn't been made, Justice White, is a determination, an actual factual determination that 100 percent of the overcharge was passed on to all of the customers. 
    That was assumed in the Tenth Circuit opinion. 
    The district court did not find that, and there has never been a finding on that in this case. 
    In fact, I would submit that there... that not 100 percent of the overcharges were passed on, but some lesser number. 
    There are, for example, line losses, in that when you have pipes running all over the countryside, gas leaks out. 
    And it doesn't get billed to consumers. 
    UtiliCorp pays for the natural gas when it... at the wellhead when it purchases gas.

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Well, I submit it would not be easy. 
    The purchased-gas adjustment clauses are based on estimates, and what happens is that on a particular day the supplier announces that in 30 days its price is going to go up to X amount per mcf, the word you're looking for, a thousand cubic feet. 
    And the court... the company then estimates how much its gas cost per customer, per customer class will have to go up. 
    But those are only estimates. 
    And there has to be an additional procedure that is gone through later in the year where you try to true that up. 
    And I will certainly agree that there is an effort to true it up, to make it the same. 
    But it is not something that was determinable at the time this litigation was started.

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    The plaintiffs in this case have never suggested that residential customers, and indeed industrial and commercial customers, were not damaged to some extent by defendant's action. 
    That is why I go back to my original point, the question is of antitrust policy. 
    Do you want to continue, as in Illinois Brick, concentrating the damage recovery in one party, so that that party will have the greatest incentive to sue, so that you will minimize the complexities that we have been talking about here.

    Is there anything in the record to give us an idea of the percentage of these... of the total damages that were absorbed by the utility directly? 
    When you talk about some of the gas being lost in the pipeline, and the fact that you have to heat your own facilities. 
    I am thinking de minimis, but is there some way you can give me an estimate of what percentage of the damages were absorbed by the utility itself?

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Justice Kennedy, there is nothing in the record from which that could be determined. 
    It was assumed by the trial court, and there could have been discovery on it. 
    I can give you an idea that you are correct that it would be a relatively small number, that most of the overcharges were then passed on to the customers. 
    But you get into a problem of allocation. 
    Remember, we are talking about a preliminary question here of, not quite standing, but antitrust injury. 
    And the way we got into this was at the very beginning of the case we filed a motion for summary judgment against not the states, but against the defendants on the pass-on defense. 
    Because the defendants were saying you don't have a right to recover anything in this case. 
    And so, instead of having us litigate the issue of allocation which you have raised, and try to determine well, UtiliCorp has got 2 percent of the total overcharges, whatever that number may be, the district court quite properly concluded, under the doctrine of Illinois Brick, that there should just be... an antitrust damage claim should be concentrated in the direct purchaser.

    Justice Scalia, that is a substantial number. 
    In the case of KPL it is over $15 million, according to the experts. 
    In the case of UtiliCorp it is over $4 million of lost margin damages. 
    Now, that does not include whatever additional damages the utility suffered by paying more for gas that they did not resell to consumers. 
    But it is a substantial number. 
    And though the states make much of our incentive to bring this case, in fact it was KPL, the first direct purchaser, who brought the lawsuit in 1984. 
    And it wasn't until several months later that the states of Missouri and Kansas did join in the suit.

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Treble damages and protecting our market, Justice Scalia. 
    Because, as you point out, if you are a residential home owner, for example, and you put more insulation in your attic, we are not going to be able to sell you as much gas in the future. 
    It's not just an immediate downturn because we have been able to sell you gas in the past and we'll get that back, because we have lost market for the long term. 
    And that is particularly also true for the commercial and industrial customers. 
    If a home owner goes out and installs a wood burning fireplace in his house and starts burning a lot of wood, that is demand loss to us. 
    That is a loss to our margin permanently. 
    Now, Mr. Greenan suggested that we could go back to the utility commissions and try to get some of this margin back. 
    But in fact UtiliCorp, particularly the Missouri public service division, did not have a rate case between 1983 and 1988, the major portion of the damage period. 
    And we do believe that the company suffered substantial damages, and it was certainly enough to cause us to bring this suit.

speaker="floyd_r_finch_jr" startTime="2128.375" stopTime="2223.972">
    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Yes, they would. 
    And I guess the question is what incentive is enough, and what level of complexity and what level of expense is enough. 
    Mr. Greenan pointed out that UtiliCorp dropped out of the case for a while. 
    I wasn't privy to that decision; I don't know why it was made. 
    But I suggest that part of the reason may well have been the concern that you just raised, Justice O'Connor, that when you don't know how much of it you are going to be allowed to recover, and when you know there is going to be tremendous expense right up front in the litigation, litigating about whether you can even be involved in the case, that is a tremendous disincentive that this Court frowned upon in Illinois Brick, and should continue to frown upon, we submit. 
    The question that Justice Scalia raised about who recovers for the industrial and commercial customers should be a significant one on the Court's mind, for, after all, there is some inconsistency here in the states' position. 
    They say well, when it comes to residential customers, we or the consumers themselves, can sue. 
    But when it comes to industrial and commercial customers, then the utilities can sue. 
    As Justice Posner suggested, because perhaps the utilities ate some of the overcharges, didn't pass along all the overcharges. 
    But the fact is that the industrial and commercial customers of these two parties, UtiliCorp and KPL, have not sued, probably, I would submit, in reliance upon Illinois Brick and the fact that they would be entitled under the utility regulatory scheme to get back a large part of their damages. 
    So we have a question of equity and justice here for those customers whose claims would now be barred by the statute of limitations.

    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    It does not, as I read it, Justice Rehnquist, bar a claim by individual consumers, but the states, when they file their lawsuit, are supposed to have given individual consumers notice so they could opt out. 
    In fact that has never been done in this case, even though the states filed their claims back in 1985 and 1986. 
    So we don't know, if there was such a notice given, how many consumers might well choose to opt out and pursue their own litigation.

speaker="floyd_r_finch_jr" startTime="2265.102" stopTime="2431.385">
    Mr. Floyd R. Finch, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I want to point out, if you... if the Court would like to discuss the argument that Section 4(c) allows the state attorneys general to bring this case, that it was not raised in the court below. 
    It was not presented in the certiorari petition before this Court. 
    Moreover, I would suggest the Court has already rejected that argument in footnote 14 of Illinois Brick. 
    Indeed it would be an odd statutory construction, if Section 4(c) is based on Section 4, to have a rule like in Illinois Brick, that an indirect purchaser cannot sue under Section 4, but under Section 4(c) a state may sue on behalf of that indirect purchaser. 
    And indeed, the statute doesn't make any sense that way, for if you allow a consumer to opt out under Section 4(c), but you don't give him the right to sue under Section 4, it's just internally inconsistent. 
    Apparently there was the assumption of some congressman in 1976 that Illinois Brick might have come out the other way. 
    But I think the states have recognized, by their efforts to go back to Congress and get Illinois Brick changed, that in fact Congress did not authorize in Section 4(c) parens patriae suits on behalf of indirect purchasers. 
    Surely the proof that Congress has not acted shows there is no strong sentiment in Congress for changing the direct purchaser rule that this court enunciated in Illinois Brick. 
    In this case, I contend that the purposes of the antitrust laws is... are best served by concentrating the recovery in the direct purchaser, instead of splintering the recovery among industrial customers, commercial customers, the state attorney generals or any consumers who may bring their own cases. 
    The incentive should be maximized, so the deterrent will be maximized. 
    I point out that one of the concerns in Illinois Brick was that the direct purchaser should have the best knowledge, and that is... does appear to be what happened in this case, in that the Kansas Power and Light Company, the direct purchaser, did the investigation and filed the antitrust suit, and the states, and for that matter UtiliCorp, piggybacked in on KPL's work product. 
    I point out that this is a case in which the utilities have gotten it right. 
    They have sued for treble damages to protect their market, and to some extent, I suppose, out of a sense of public service duty that a public service commission has. 
    But if this Court were to take away 50 to 95 percent of this recovery, I would ask how much of an enthusiastic plaintiff will a utility be the next time around, the next time there's an antitrust case. 
    I would submit that the ruling of the Tenth Circuit should be upheld.

   Argument of Lawrence S. Robbins
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="2435.629" stopTime="2572.421">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    With respect, I believe Mr. Greenan has misformulated the question before the Court. 
    The rule of Illinois Brick is not that the direct purchaser is the proper party to sue unless it is easy to demonstrate that there has been no absorption of the overcharge. 
    The rule in Illinois Brick is as follows, that with a cost-plus contract the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge, because its customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity, regardless of price. 
    Even if it were the case that the regulatory framework in which this case comes before the Court solved the problem of apportionment, that would only be the tip of the iceberg. 
    Illinois Brick is not simply about the apportionment of overcharges. 
    Instead, Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe stem from a longer tradition in which this Court has uniformly held that an injured direct purchaser is entitled to sue for the entire overcharge, regardless of whether and to what extent that direct purchaser passes on the overcharge to its customers. 
    It is that tradition that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick dealt with when it adverted to the possibility that there might be a cost-plus exception. 
    Now, one thing is perfectly clear. 
    If there is a cost-plus exception, it does not cover this case, because, as Petitioners freely concede, the direct purchaser in this case was injured. 
    It suffered the loss of profits as a result of having to pass on an overcharge, to whatever extent it did, to its customers. 
    And so, what is clear beyond, I think, contradiction, is that if there is to be an exception to cover this case, it will be a new exception, an exception that departs from the tradition that has always held that an injured direct purchaser, injured in any form, injured by the overcharge or injured by lost profits, and lost profits are not contravened in this case, is entitled to sue for the entire overcharge.

    Now, it seems to me, Justice White, and this returns also to the question Justice O'Connor raised before: is this a windfall. 
    Well, in one sense I suppose it is a windfall, but it was a windfall that this Court recognized and anticipated the possibility of in Illinois Brick, recognizing that it may well be the case that some indirect purchasers who suffered an injury may not be compensated. 
    But that was anticipated for a reason, anticipated because the Court concluded, as it had in Hanover Shoe, that locating and maximizing the incentive in the direct purchaser is the best policy for the antitrust laws, seeking the maximum deterrence at the most efficient price.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, it is not hard to say that, but it won't be correct. 
    And it may not be correct for two reasons. 
    First of all, you are going to have litigation about whether the regulation in fact requires the utility to pass it on. 
    These parties are in dispute about that very question. 
    The... the PJA clauses throughout the states may be different. 
    They may be hard to read. 
    And you are going to have litigation about whether it is even required. 
    You will then have litigation about whether it has been complied with. 
    What looks like a dollar-for-dollar pass-through may be nothing more than the postponement of the rate increase that would have come about anyway, a concern which this Court expressly identified in Hanover Shoe. 
    What looks like a pass-through may be an increase for other reasons. 
    But even if they had solved the apportionment problem, and they haven't... they haven't solved it with the ease that Hanover Shoe requires, you then have a variety of other problems that they haven't come close to solving, and indeed in some respects have made worse. 
    The complication of litigation. 
    It is not going to go away, it is going to come back fourfold. 
    It's going to come back because you are going to increase the number of litigants in court. 
    You are going to increase the kinds of damages they are seeking. 
    The indirect purchasers will seek the overcharge. 
    The direct purchasers will sue either for the lost profits and, as Petitioners have conceded this morning, some portion of the overcharge for unrepresented customers that the state's parens patriae can't... can't represent. 
    Lost profits are very hard to calculate, because they require you to prove the overcharge, and then calculate the effect of the overcharge on the demand curve, how inelastic or elastic is the demand, the very thing this Court wanted to get away from in Illinois Brick. 
    As a consequence of the proliferation of parties and the complication of the damage theories, you will do a couple of other things. 
    You'll reduce the incentives on direct purchasers--

    But won't those same difficulties stand in the way of the utilities' recovering lost profits?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="2834.009" stopTime="2934.742">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, in our view, Mr. Chief Justice, if the direct purchasers are in that lawsuit alone they may attempt to seek both kinds of damages. 
    But as a practical matter, because the overcharge will always be greater than, or at worst equal to, the lost profits, they will tend in the aggregate to seek only the overcharge. 
    And as a result, the more complicated inquiry for lost profits will in the main wash away. 
    There will also not be competing claims for the same total recovery, a concern that this Court articulated in ARC America. 
    You will not have two or more categories of plaintiffs suing over a common Federal pot under Section 4. 
    And that competing claim, and the proliferation of theories and parties that will inevitably ensue, and only gets worse under Petitioners' theory, is what is going to ultimately dilute the intended incentive on the direct purchasers to sue. 
    What is more, finally, I think, if you open the door the crack that they seek this morning, there will be many more exceptions brought to your doorstep. 
    If today it's 100 percent regulation, tomorrow it will be a 95 percent regulation, because in theory there is no greater reason why the 95 percent pass-through plaintiffs shouldn't be in court as well. 
    And it is precisely that concern, I suggest, that caused this Court to hesitate to even say whether there is any cost-plus exception at all. 
    In each of the Court's cases the suggestion has been that there might be such an exception. 
    And I think that hesitation makes a good deal of sense, because in a case in which it's not required to reach that result, it ought not to be reached.

    It may, with a party that has chosen to rely on 4(c), and at that time I suspect our answer will be the same as to the 4(c) question. 
    But that's not here, and I think for good reason. 
    Now, it may be that in the end Petitioners' clients bore some or most of the overcharge. 
    And it may also be that the regulatory framework alleviates to some extent some, but hardly all, of the concerns in Illinois Brick. 
    But this Court has anticipated such possibilities and has refused to carve out an exception for particular markets. 
    It has discouraged that venture at every turn.

   Rebuttal of Thomas J. Greenan

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    I do, Your Honor. 
    I think it should be clear that the fact-specific arguments that UtiliCorp has made are not before this Court. 
    This action is here based upon summary judgment motions brought by UtiliCorp which were decided before discovery was well underway. 
    The court below assumed that there was a perfect and provable 100 percent pass-on, and that is the facts that are before the Court today. 
    Justice O'Connor, I agree that you can look at the utility customer's bill and determine what amount they had been charged for what amount of gas. 
    Fortunately, in the parens patriae situation that is not necessary, because the statute clearly provides that the attorneys general may aggregate those claims to make them easily provable so that individual consumers do not have to come in and prove that. 
    That procedural device was specifically spelled out. 
    When the government says that clearly the court was relying upon a rule without deviation that the direct purchaser recover, it ignores Hanover Shoe, it ignores Illinois Brick, it ignores the discussions that this Court has had with regard to this rule since then. 
    Note 12 in Illinois Brick, referring to the pass-on defense which the Court recognized in Hanover Shoe, said that they recognize that because the preexisting cost-plus contract makes the normally complicated task of demonstrating that the overcharge had not been absorbed... excuse me, makes easy the normally complicated task of demonstrating that the overcharge had not been absorbed by the direct purchaser. 
    That is the law of Illinois Brick. 
    That is what we are talking about here. 
    This particular situation is one that the Court has always recognized, that the... would exist. 
    With regard to whether or not the 4(c) question is here, Your Honor, we have to admit that it was not argued below. 
    But I think that Justice Stevens has... has put his finger on it, that the... that the complaints were brought pursuant to 4(c). 
    Only 4(c) permits--

    Mr. Thomas J. Greenan 
    It does not say that in so many terms, no, Your Honor. 
    We have to look to the legislative history. 
    I think that the cases of this Court clearly demonstrate that the United States is in error when it says that the Court has always assumed only the direct purchaser. 
    In the very next term after Hanover Shoe, this Court examined a question in Perkins v. Standard Oil and followed a claim down through several levels in a chain of distribution to allow Perkins to have standing to proceed with that claim in that action. 
    Here, as the Court recently said in the ARC America case, if it is easy to prove the extent to which the overcharge has been passed on to the indirect purchaser, then this Court... the phrasing in that was might allow an exception. 
    We believe that this Court should recognize that this exception is within the language set forth in Illinois Brick, and that an affirmance of Illinois Brick would require--
