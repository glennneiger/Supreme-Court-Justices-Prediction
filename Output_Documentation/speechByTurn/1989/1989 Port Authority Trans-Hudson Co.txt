Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation v. Feeney

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-386, Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation v. Patrick Feeney. 
    Mr. Lesser.
speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="15.926" stopTime="211.603">
    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created in 1921 by a compact between the states to which Congress consented. 
    And the principal burden of my argument today before the Court is to demonstrate beyond any question whatsoever that the Port Authority is structured, administered and operated as a direct instrumentality of the compacting states, and is politically and legally accountable as such to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states. 
    It should therefore, I submit, be recognized for what it clearly is: an integral part of the governmental machinery of the two states, completely subject to their control and direction. 
    As a direct arm of the states, the Port Authority should be held, I believe, to share the states' constitutional protections and immunities, including their Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    Such a holding, I shall show, fulfills not only the underlying purpose of the Eleventh Amendment's conceded deference to state's sovereignty, but also that of the compact clause, by encouraging the states to solve cooperatively their regional problems, thus enhancing, I submit, the vitality of our Federal system. 
    That the Port Authority is unquestionably a direct arm of the states, fully subject to their control and direction is most easily demonstrated. 
    The compact declares that the commissioners of the Port Authority, 12 in all, constitute the Port Authority. 
    Six of these commissioners are appointed by the governor of each state, with the advice and consent of the respective state senates. 
    The commissioners are subject to removal after charges upon hearing in New York by the governor of the state, and in New Jersey by the state senate. 
    The governors significantly possess a veto power over all actions which the commissioners of the Authority take. 
    The Authority cannot take any action which is not subject to gubernatorial veto. 
    And the Authority, as an arm of the states, is completely subject to legislative control and direction. 
    The Authority has no autonomous powers of government, like a county or a municipality, which of course, counties and municipalities do not share the states' sovereign immunity from suit. 
    The Port Authority has no such powers. 
    Everything the Port Authority does is authorized by bi-state legislation. 
    And the Port Authority is duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures and to follow their directions. 
    Because of the Port Authority's closeness, intimate relationship to the compacting states, it is not surprising that before 1950 and '51, when the states waived the Port Authority's sovereign immunity, every court that had occasion to pass upon this question, the courts of New York, the courts of New Jersey and the lower Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared the sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states. 
    As a matter of fact--

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --No, I don't think so. 
    I think this question before the Court is really fact intensive or fact specific. 
    A municipal corporation has autonomous powers. 
    As this Court said years ago, it's too remote from the states. 
    The Port Authority is not too remote from the states. 
    In fact, the only reason probably the Port Authority is not a department of state government was that the necessity of interstate cooperation. 
    It was the necessity to draft a compact between the states creating this agency. 
    In fact--

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    Not... not at all. 
    It could only do what the two legislatures authorize. 
    It can't do what it wants in the abstract. 
    As a matter of fact, the only time the Port Authority was held to exceed its statutory powers was a case in the early 1950s when the Port Authority thought it had the power to construct a third tube to the Lincoln Tunnel, relying upon a statutory directive that said that the Lincoln Tunnel shall consist of tubes or tube... tube or tubes within a narrow geographical compass. 
    And the Port Authority thought that the plural meant two or more. 
    But the New Jersey Supreme Court held to the contrary. 
    And the New Jersey Supreme Court said that the Port Authority is bound... duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures. 
    And with that decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Port Authority subsequently got a specific bi-state legislation authorizing the construction of the third tube. 
    The Port Authority, Justice Scalia, could do nothing that the legislatures do not authorize. 
    Is completely subject to their control in the same way that almost any department of state government is subject to their control. 
    The states originally tried to act cooperatively when they entered into a compact in 1919, relating to the Holland Tunnel. 
    There were separate state commissions in New York and in New Jersey that were acting cooperatively. 
    And that just didn't work. 
    It didn't work efficiently. 
    And therefore, the legislatures, under the compact clause, which as Felix Frankfurter and James M. Landis wrote from the path-breaking article in the Yale Law Journal in 1925, fosters Federalism by encouraging the states to solve cooperatively problems that transcend their state boundaries but yet do not need national solutions at the Federal level.

    As a matter of fact, at the present time, the Port... the Port Authority was originally funded by the states. 
    The states appropriated money until the Port Authority became self-sufficient. 
    When the Port Authority finally became self-sufficient, now the Port Authority is a source of funds for the compacting states. 
    In fact, the Port Authority in recent years has been subject to legislative direction, has been engaged in providing the states with nonrevenue-producing projects that they... that they need. 
    The Port Authority's surplus funds are now available, pursuant to legislation and pursuant to gubernatorial veto power, really, at the request of the states and subject to the rights of bondholders.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --I do. 
    I think there's a problem in New York. 
    The Port Authority has no surplus funds as such. 
    The Port Authority funds are subject to legislative control. 
    As a matter of fact, when the states gave the Port Authority the Holland Tunnel, which was a source of... at least during the 1930s and '40s... of immense revenue to the Port Authority, they controlled the flow of Port Authority funds. 
    Because the last paragraph in the Authority's General Reserve Fund Act, which the legislatures passed in 1931, provides any surplus revenues not required for the establishment and maintenance of the aforesaid general reserve fund shall be used for such purposes as may hereafter be directed by the two said states. 
    And the states, as I mentioned before, are now the recipient of Port Authority funds, all subject to legislative direction and control.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --only in a very remote sense. 
    Municipalities can adopt laws not subject to gubernatorial veto. 
    Let me specifically state that this Court has had two cases involving compact agencies. 
    In the first, Petty against the Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, this Court... this Court assumed that the Commission, which was modeled after the Port Authority... in fact, I was struck when I looked at the legislation authorizing the Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, that legislation was almost copied word from word from the Port Authority's port compact. 
    And the question that this Court had, in Justice Douglas' opinion was, the question here is whether Tennessee and Missouri have waived their immunity under the facts of this case. 
    And in that case, the only major difference between the compact authorization of that agency and the Port Authority's was, in that agency there was a sue and be sued clause. 
    And Justice Douglas' opinion went into detail whether that sue and be sued clause constituted a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --I think not, Justice Kennedy. 
    Until 1950 and '51, the courts of both states and the lower Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared the sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states. 
    In fact, one New York court said, it is hard to see how there could be a clearer instance of an agency sharing the immunity of its creators. 
    And a New Jersey court said, since the Authority is undoubtedly a direct agency of the states, exercising an essential governmental function and is therefore an alter ego of the state, it follows that the present action is, in effect, a suit against the state itself, which will be clothed with sovereign immunity unless a waiver or consent can be found.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    No, they were not. 
    With the decision of these cases in 1950 and '51, both legislatures adopted the Port Authority suability legislation. 
    And in that legislation, section 1 of that legislation constitutes the waiver. 
    Section 1 of that legislation states that the States of New York and New Jersey consent to suits against the Port Authority. 
    That's the waiver. 
    That's the giving of jurisdiction. 
    The venue provision to which Justice Kennedy alluded a moment ago states, the foregoing consent is granted upon the condition that venue. 
    So you have to find the waiver of immunity from suit in section one.

    This Court has said that only where stated by the most express statutory language or by such overwhelming implication from the text, as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction, will it find a waiver.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    The Port Authority has never knowingly consented to be sued. 
    But when the original statute... suability statute was passed, the Port Authority has been a defendant in Federal courts. 
    This was in the era, I think, of Pardon against Alabama Dock Railroad, when this Court stated that when an agency is involved in interstate commerce, and Congress regulates that agency, the states, by engaging in such activity, impliedly waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    But Pardon was expressly overruled by this Court a few years ago in Welch. 
    And since the Welch decision, the Port Authority has always maintained that it shares the Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    The Port Authority was suable in Federal courts, unknowingly, during the era of Pardon. 
    But with Pardon's being overruled by Welsh, the Port Authority, I believe, shares the Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    And I think this obscure reference is not the type... to Federal courts... is not the type of knowing waiver that this Court has required. 
    I don't understand it. 
    The Second and Third Circuits disagreed as to its meaning. 
    And if there is... and with both decisions, the Second and Third Circuits' disagreement, I don't think either ruling of either circuit could be considered arbitrary or capricious. 
    And then the question is, where does the presumption lie? 
    If the presumption was that uncertain language results in a waiver, then there would have been a waiver.

    No, the Port Authority is suable, pursuant to the provisions of the bi-state suability statutes that were adopted in 1950 and '51. 
    The Port Authority is fully suable in state court. 
    As a matter of fact, if this Court should hold that the Port Authority possesses the Eleventh Amendment immunity, these petitioners and others have the normal workman's compensation action in state court.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    There... there in Petty it was just assumed that there was immunity, was there not? 
    The Court didn't decide it.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --Well, it was... it was assumed, yes. 
    It was assumed. 
    But Justice Frankfurter, in his opinion... his dissenting opinion in Petty stated, had there been no sue and be sued clause in the compact, this bridge commission could not have been sued in the Federal courts, despite the fact that it was operating a vessel on navigable waters in interstate commerce.

    Yes.

    The closest case to this--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1182.520" stopTime="1184.237">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, how about a majority case?
speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="1184.237" stopTime="1193.126">
    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --A majority case was the opinion in the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency case. 
    In that case, this Court set forth six factors.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But that case did not... that case ruled against the particular entity in question, didn't it?

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    Yes. 
    And I think wisely so.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1199.565" stopTime="1210.271">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, so... so the Court... there's never been a holding of the Court extending Eleventh Amendment immunity to any body other than the state itself, or a state official, is that correct?
speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="1210.271" stopTime="1256.252">
    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    That's correct. 
    But the Court has never had a case where an agency closely... so closely identified with the states as the Port Authority. 
    In the Tahoe Regional Planning case, the Ninth Circuit adopted what this Court has called an absolute rule that any agency that was so important enough to be created by acts of two state legislatures, with the consent of Congress, automatically... this is what the Ninth Circuit held... automatically possessed the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states'. 
    And I think this Court quite properly rejected that absolute rule. 
    This Court set forth six factors in which it can be determined whether an agency is so closely allied with the states as to share their Eleventh Amendment immunity.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    No, not under Frankfurter's view... not under the view of the three dissenters in Petty. 
    They said that this Court should interpret the sue and be sued clause as the state courts in Tennessee and Missouri interpreted it. 
    And they interpreted that clause to mean that the agency was not liable in tort. 
    And the majority... Justice Douglas stated that the sue and be sued clause... that when Congress adopted or consented to the compact with the sue and be sued clause, it consented it to the compact in the light of an earlier decision by this Court in the late 1930s involving the Reconstruction Finance Corporation... Keefer against the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. 
    And in that case, this Court ruled that a sue and be sued clause relating to a Federal agency constitutes a waiver of immunity. 
    And Justice Douglas said that that decision in the Keefer case, involving the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, show that Congress, when it consented to a sue and be sued clause, consented to a full waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    But I think, as far as the waiver provision is concerned, this Court has, in recent years, clearly taken a much more stringent view, saying that the general sue and be sued clause does not include a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity unless it's absolutely crystal clear. 
    But let me just go through... Your Honor, the factors listed in the Tahoe Regional Planning Association case. 
    This Court listed six factors. 
    And we think the Port Authority meets all of those six factors to be accorded Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    First, this Court said, how were the governing officials appointed? 
    Are they appointed by local governing boards? 
    In that case, the local... the majority of the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Association Board was appointed by county officials. 
    Then this Court said is there a veto at the state level? 
    There was no veto at the state level in that case. 
    There is a veto at the state level in this case. 
    Then this Court said how is the agency designated in the enabling state legislation? 
    And the Port Authority, in the enabling state legislation, is clearly designated as a joint or common agency of the two states. 
    In fact, in the compact to which Congress consented be... there was no sue and be sued clause as I already mentioned... the legislatures, in their preamble, stated that the development of necessary terminal transportation and other facilities of commerce in the region require the cordial cooperation of the states. 
    And this can be best accomplished, said the legislatures, through the cooperation of the two states by and through a joint or common agency. 
    That's... and there are many similar descriptions in the legislation of the Port Authority, as the common agency of the states. 
    Then the next factor that this Court set forth in the Tahoe Regional Planning Association case was how was the agency funded. 
    And as I previously mentioned, the Port Authority was funded by the state legislatures until it became self-sufficient. 
    And in the early days in its history, when... faced a default on its first bridge bonds. 
    And the legislatures were faced with the problem of a default by an agency like the Port Authority, they turned over to the Port Authority their Holland Tunnel, which, as I mentioned before, was constructed by separate state commissions or state departments, operating cooperatively.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Lesser, to what extent might the general funds of New York or New Jersey be held applicable to the debts of the Port Authority?
speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="1519.140" stopTime="1608.763">
    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    Technically, they're not... a judgment against the Port Authority is not payable out of the state treasuries. 
    But that doesn't mean that the states are not adversely affected by judgments against the Port Authority in the same way that they're adversely affected by judgments against either state. 
    In fact, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized that there can be multiple state treasuries in a case involving the Port Authority. 
    In this particular case, the New Jersey Supreme Court was faced with the problem of whether the Authority should have the states' rights to require the uncompensated relocation of private/public utilities in the streets and the thoroughfares of the state. 
    And the New Jersey Supreme Court said that that state rule was equally applicable to the Port Authority. 
    The Port Authority cannot be thus divorced from the citizens and taxpayers it was created to serve. 
    And the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that the general state taxpayer has a tremendous interest in the financial solvency and the operations of the Port Authority. 
    I think there can be no doubt, Mr.... this Court, that the Port Authority is a direct arm an agency of the states, and it should, therefore, share the states' sovereign immunity from suit. 
    Such a holding will, I believe, foster the principles of Federalism that both the Eleventh Amendment and the compact clause were designed to serve. 
    I'll reserve my remaining time for rebuttal. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Richard W. Miller
speaker="richard_w_miller" startTime="1615.350" stopTime="1831.758">
    Mr. Richard W. Miller 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to begin, if I may, by responding to a question that Justice Marshall posed. 
    In the legislation governing the World Trade Center, the language is quite specific that the Port Authority is supreme in its operation. 
    All details of the effectuation, including but not limited to, financing, leasing, rentals, tolls, fares, shall be within its sole discretion. 
    And its decision in connection with all matters, including the Hudson tubes, shall be controlling and conclusive. 
    The Port Authority has been described in the enabling legislation as a body corporate and politic. 
    It has been described as a private corporation in the statute that authorizes suit against the Port Authority. 
    It says, as if it were a private corporation. 
    Now the Port Authority has broad powers, which it exercises as it sees fit. 
    It does not go to either state to get second opinions. 
    It does not go to either state to ask their approval for what it wants to do. 
    It owns real estate in its own name. 
    It leases. 
    It operates real property. 
    It operates marine terminals. 
    It issues bonds in its own name. 
    It borrows money. 
    It operates its own general reserve fund. 
    And the decisions have held... opinion of the attorney general that's cited in the brief... that the bonds of the Port Authority are not obligations of either the State of New York or New Jersey. 
    It operates commuter railroads, bridges, tunnels, the World Trade Center. 
    It even has its own police department, and they're called Port Authority Police. 
    Now, the best way, I suppose, to find out what the Port Authority really is, is to see how they describe themselves. 
    The Port Authority describes itself in its comprehensive annual financial report in 1987, which they issue every year: Unlike many other authorities and governmental agencies, the Port Authority, by law, must be self-supporting. 
    It has neither the power to tax nor the right to pledge the credit of either state to support its general obligations. 
    The Port Authority pays its own way for operations on capital investment, pooling revenues earned from its facilities through rents, fees, fares, tolls and other user charges. 
    It finances new construction, major improvements and repairs by selling its bonds and other obligations. 
    Now, there is specific... there is a specific section, 7031, which says that all bonds issued by the Port Authority are deemed to be negotiable instruments. 
    And they are traded widely in brokerage houses and the stock exchange.

    --I don't think we have to look at six, Your Honor. 
    I think it's sufficient to use the language in that... in that case, which says that... as I... as... as... as I interpret it, the most important factor to look at is the impact on the state treasury of a judgment against the Authority. 
    In this particular case, there is a specific statute involving the Port Authority which obligates the states only to $100,000 as initial start-up fees and only for a very narrow category of... of expenses. 
    In other words, they weren't able to be used as... as the Port Authority see fit. 
    The statute said office expenses, administrative expenses. 
    It couldn't have been used for a judgment. 
    Other than that particular amount, $100,000 as initial start-up expenses, there was no exposure at all of the state treasury to any judgment.

    Well, Mr. Miller, a number of states, I believe, certainly those with debt limits, have been following the practice of setting up separate state agencies to fund construction projects. 
    For example, university housing. 
    And they'll structure the state board of regents as an entity to issue bonds for the housing, but not subject the state treasury, independently, to liability.

    It has its own operating budget. 
    It has its own people.

    I think you would have to do something such as they have here, where you have... the FCC, if it did, as Port Authority did, if it could own its land, it if had its own buildings it ran, whatever, I think, yes, you'd become a lot closer to answering the question that, yeah, there would no longer be an agency. 
    And assuming that they no longer got their funding, they no longer got appropriations, they... they had their own board of directors or board of commissioners that met and ran it without answering to Congress or anyone, yeah, I think then, at that point in time, you're moving away from it being an agency.

    Now, on the question of waiver, it would appear that the two sections must be read together. 
    One section, 7101 that says you can sue us in any court, in any type of matter, with a few limited exceptions, injunction being one of them. 
    The other section says we will condition that upon the condition that you sue us in the Port Authority district. 
    Or otherwise there is no jurisdiction for such a suit. 
    The last part of that section says that is shall be considered a private corporation for such lawsuits.

    Mr. Richard W. Miller 
    Well, Your Honor, I can only answer that by saying if... if it's read in conjunction with the prior statute, and they were passed at the same time, 7101 and 7106 were passed at the same time, then you would have to conclude, I believe, that when they say you can sue us in any court for any lawsuit, and the only condition we will impose is it must be within a court, be it state or Federal, within the Port Authority district. 
    I don't believe that there has to be some prior determination of... of jurisdiction before you... before you can say that judicial district means Federal courts. 
    I think, in response just to... to... to go into a little background... there was a case called Howell, which is widely cited in... in the petitioner's brief. 
    Howell was a case that came down in the District Court of New Jersey in 1940. 
    The Second Circuit refers to Howell and says that following that decision there was response by the legislatures, and these two sections, among others, were partially in response to the holding in that... in that decision, which found that there was sovereign immunity in the Port Authority. 
    The Second Circuit said, partially in response to Howell, these two sections were enacted. 
    The intent is... is fairly clear, I believe, that Port Authority says you can sue us. 
    We intend for you to sue us as long as you do it in the Port Authority district, be it a state court or a Federal court.

   Rebuttal of Joseph Lesser
speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="2934.694" stopTime="3046.415">
    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    Thank you. 
    If there's any doubt any... the mind of any Justice of this Court that the Port Authority is a direct arm and agency of the States of New York, I would really request that you look at appendix A to our reply brief. 
    Because that appendix sets forth the 150-odd statutes... separate statutes that the states have passed in reference to the Port Authority from 1921 to the present. 
    Those statutes, dealing with major considerations of state public policy to minor housekeeping chores, in my mind, demonstrates beyond question that the Port Authority is a direct agency and arm of the states that created them. 
    This list of statutes, by subject matter and title, I think leaves no doubt in anybody's mind... should leave no doubt in anybody's mind... of the status of the Port Authority. 
    It has been... the Port Authority has been questioned as a state agency. 
    It is referred to in the compact as a joint or common agency of the states. 
    The reason why the Port Authority was created and given those functions was that those problems transcend state boundary lines. 
    The states try to cooperate in the 1919 compact, to which Congress consented, by setting up independent commissions that were really departments of state government to act cooperatively. 
    It wasn't an efficient mechanism. 
    I think the compact clause, with the Eleventh Amendment, would fortify Federalism, would fortify the underlying principles of Federalism by giving the states the power to set up an entity like the Port Authority, which is undoubtedly a state agency.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    That was... yes, it was, in contradiction to a normal municipality. 
    In the same provision of the compact, it refers to ordinary municipal corporations. 
    It was something different. 
    It was unknown at the time what the Port Authority was. 
    It was a major advance, I think, in American public law on government that the states could use the compact clause creatively, to create an agency that would represent them in all affairs.

    Mr. Joseph Lesser 
    --It... it, in other portions of the compact, it refers to the Port Authority as a joint... a common agency. 
    I just haven't got the phrase right before me. 
    But it distinguishes between ordinary municipality and municipal corporate instrumentality, which is the Port Authority. 
    The Port Authority is assuredly not a municipality. 
    It has no power to tax; it has no general police power; it has no right to enact ordinances; it has no general condemnation power; it has no home law powers. 
    My opponent referred to the provision in the suability statute that the Port Authority should be liable as if it were a private corporation. 
    That provision was inserted to get around the New York Court of Appeals decision in State against Smith. 
    Unless that provision applied, specifically waiving immunity from... creating immunity... creating tort liability, the Port Authority might not have been liable in tort, even though it was otherwise suable. 
    The same language, practically, apply... is found in the New York Court of Claims Act, where the state waived its sovereign immunity for itself in the New York Court of Claims. 
    My opponent also referred to some language saying that the Port Authority, in operating its facilities, shall not... does not have to comply with rules and regulations of others. 
    That just means--
