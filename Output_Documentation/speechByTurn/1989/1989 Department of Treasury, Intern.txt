    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-2123, the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. Federal Labor Relations Authority. 
    Mr. Shapiro.
speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="13.441" stopTime="142.379">
    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question in this case is whether a Federal agency can be required to bargain over a union proposal that would subject certain agency decisions with respect to the contracting out of agency work to the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement and to third-party arbitration. 
    The agency position, that is, the position of the Internal Revenue Service in this case, has been that it cannot be required to bargain over this proposal, that indeed, bargaining over the proposal is precluded by the management rights provision of the Federal Labor Management Relations statute. 
    The union proposal in this case is related to Circular A-76, issued by the Office of Management and Budget, which is an arm of the Executive Office of the President. 
    Circular A-76 was originally issued in the early... in the 1950s and has been amended a number of times ever since. 
    It is a statement of executive policy on the important matter of Federal procurement. 
    It deals in some detail with the circumstances under which the particular work shall be done inside the agency or shall be contracted out. 
    The Circular specifically states not only that it is designed to give administrative direction to heads of agencies, but, and I quote, that it 
    "shall not establish and shall not be construed to create any substantive or procedural basis for anyone to challenge any agency action or inaction on the basis that it was not in accordance with the Circular, except as specifically provided in the Circular itself. " 
    The Circular then goes on--

    --Well, the core of our argument, Your Honor, is that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law within the meaning of the management rights provision. 
    So that if Circular A-76 did confer third-party rights that would be enforceable in court, then that threshold aspect of our argument would be crossed, and you would come to the latter part of our argument that the subject matter of the Circular is excluded from bargaining by Section 7117--

    Yes, we do, Your Honor, although we think that question need be reached only if the Court determines that it is an applicable law under 7106.

speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="265.633" stopTime="376.754">
    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    There are three relevant provisions of this statute, Your Honor. 
    There is the definition of a grievance, in Section 7103, which refers very broadly to any complaint of any violation of a law, rule or regulation. 
    There is Section 7117, which excludes from the scope of bargaining any proposal that is inconsistent with any governmentwide rule or regulation. 
    Now, it may be that the concept of a rule in those two provisions is the same. 
    We content in our brief that it is not. 
    But it may be that it is. 
    Congress has indicated in the legislative history that it regards a government policy statement as within the scope of 7117. 
    But the third provision of the act, and the one in which we place our central reliance, is the management rights provision of 7106. 
    That section does not use the words rule or regulation. 
    It speaks only of applicable laws. 
    And in our view the scope and purpose of that section is very different. 
    Now, there is, as I say, a reference in Circular A-76 to an internal appeals procedure within the agency itself that agencies are required to create. 
    But that internal appeals procedure, as spelled out in the Circular, is not to authorize an appeal outside the agency or judicial review, and it is provided that it may not be subject to negotiation, arbitration or agreement.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    No, I think it is... I think it is inherent in the agency's appropriations that certain kinds of functions may be performed either in-house or by contracting out. 
    But I don't believe the authority to contract out comes from the Circular. 
    The Circular is a statement of policy about how existing authority is to be exercised. 
    The Circular does in fact purport to preclude contracting out of certain kinds of governmental functions. 
    But the Circular, I don't believe, is the source of authority. 
    I think the government's authority to contract out predates the Circular, which goes back only to the 1950s.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    I think the authority of the agency exists even if there were no Circular. 
    The Circular is defined... designed to give the agency direction with respect to the exercise of that authority. 
    And so, when the agency follows A-76, it is making determinations with respect to contracting out. 
    The agency isn't... I'm sorry, the Circular is a direction to Federal agencies. 
    I think I was only trying to suggest that the authority to contract out predates the publication of the Circular, and I believe would exist even if there were no Circular. 
    But the Circular is designed to direct the exercise of that authority. 
    The union proposal in this case was a proposal, and I quote it at this point, that the 
    "internal appeals procedure of the Circular shall be the grievance and arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. " 
    The agency refused to bargain over that, holding that bargaining was precluded by the management rights provision. 
    The Federal Labor Relations Authority upheld the union's claim that the proposal was subject to bargaining. 
    The matter was taken to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held two to one that the agency was correct. 
    In that decision, the D.C. Circuit was coming down with a result that was diametrically opposed to the en banc decision of the Fourth Circuit, as well as to the rationale of a decision of the Ninth Circuit, and so that decision was brought here for review.

    --Well no, quite explicitly in our brief on page 38. 
    It is not the core of our argument. 
    The FLRA has an answer to that argument which we believe is not correct. 
    I don't want to make it for them, but to summarize it very briefly it is that since Circular A-76 is a rule or regulation, the authority to subject decisions under it to the grievance procedure and arbitration exists under the Federal Labor Management Relations statute. 
    7117, they say, only operates to preclude certain matters from negotiation, but not from the operation of the grievance procedure or the arbitration provision. 
    We contend that that position is incorrect.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    That's right, and indeed that is their argument. 
    Their argument here is that the union proposal is superfluous, that the authority to go to the grievance procedure and arbitration would exist even without it. 
    In fact, the FLRA's position here is that this case essentially is resolved by the definition of a grievance in Section 7103. 
    They say that because the concept of a grievance has such a broad definition, any matter relating to subcontracting, in effect, can be taken to arbitration without regard to the management rights provision. 
    Indeed, as I read their argument, they are saying that the definition of a grievance overrides the management rights provision. 
    That the management rights provision, they say, comes into play only insofar as it may exercise a constraint on the arbitrator's decision. 
    That the arbitrator may not substitute his judgment for that of a Federal agency in matters of discretion. 
    Now, on this score, that is, reading the grievance procedure in effect to override the threshold provisions of the management rights provision, there is a very fundamental disagreement between the FLRA and the Federal agency employer in this case that goes to the heart of the construction and purpose of the statute. 
    We believe the FLRA is incorrect for two essential reasons. 
    First of all, the definition of a grievance is very broad. 
    It covers not only any complaint involving the violation of a rule or regulation, but also, as the union quite happily points out, covers any complaint involving any matter relating to employment. 
    So that if the definition of a grievance overrode the management rights provision, it would be not only that any complaint of violation of Circular A-76 could be taken to arbitration, but any complaint about subcontracting, even if there were no Circular A-76, because, as we concede, a complaint about subcontracting is a complaint about a matter relating to employment. 
    We do not believe that the grievance definition can override the management rights provision in that way. 
    Indeed, the management rights provision itself makes it clear that that cannot be so. 
    The management rights provision, Section 7106, which is an essential part of this statute in terms of the very special needs of the government, states that subject to Subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter, and that includes the definition of a grievance, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency in accordance with applicable law to make determinations with respect to contracting out. 
    Now, in our view, that means that determinations with respect to contracting out, which is what we have in this case, can be subject to the act despite the management rights provision only in two circumstances. 
    One is if it falls within Subsection (b) of the management rights provision. 
    No such contention is made here by the FLRA or the union. 
    The other is--

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Subsection (2) deals with procedures, and it has never been contended that that is what's involved here. 
    Subsection (3) deals with the impact or effect of a determination but not with the determination itself. 
    The other ground on which a matter might be excluded from the coverage of the management rights provision is if the question is one of conformity with an applicable law. 
    If it is, then, Justice Scalia, we come to the argument that we have made under 7117. 
    But we contend, in accordance with every lower court judge who has discussed this issue, that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law within the meaning of the management rights provision. 
    And we contend that for several reasons, which we think are evident from the face of the document itself, from its source, from its purpose and from its application. 
    To begin with, as I indicated earlier, the document itself makes it clear that it is intended as a directive from a superior to a subordinate for the guidance of that subordinate, and that it is not designed to create any third-party rights or enforceable duties. 
    It says specifically that it shall not be construed to create any basis for anyone to challenge any agency action. 
    Now, it is not simply the evident purpose of the document that we believe leads to that conclusion, it is the nature of the document. 
    It is the fact that the document is issued as a policy directive on a matter of procurement policy by a branch of the Executive Office of the President, which is the President's principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions. 
    It is a document that necessarily contains in it a great deal of delegated discretion, that is... is essential for the effective operation of this document that agency heads bring their expert judgment to bear on these decisions. 
    And it is a document which it's clear purpose and effect is designed essentially as any order from a superior to a subordinate would be designed. 
    It is, in other words, in our view, the exercise of the very kind of managerial prerogative that Section 7106 is designed to preserve.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    No, we do... we do concede that, Your Honor, that regulations having the force of law would be applicable laws. 
    We don't believe that this is such a regulation. 
    We believe it is a policy statement which has always been viewed by the courts, which views itself, which is designed simply as an instruction from a superior to a subordinate. 
    We do not believe that Congress intended, in using the phrase applicable law, to permit the vehicle of the exercise of managerial discretion to become the instrument for eliminating managerial discretion. 
    And for that reason we ask that the judgment below be reversed.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    --Specifically, Your Honor, I am not aware that a particular statement that says that the management rights provision itself limits the scope of what is grievable or subject to arbitration. 
    Indeed, there are some ambiguous statements that are very heavily relied on by the union and the FLRA, by Representatives Udall and Ford, that might be read the other way. 
    I may address those for a minute. 
    In the first place, we don't believe that these ambiguous statements could possibly override the very clear language of the chapter on the provision that says nothing in this chapter, including the definition of a grievance. 
    In the second place, the statement by Representative Ford was made after the enactment of the statute, and this Court has recognized that post-enactment statements are not... do not throw any light on the intent or purpose of the statute. 
    And finally, we think the statements can fairly be read simply as saying that if a question of conformity with applicable law does arise, that then the grievance and arbitration provisions of the statute may come into play. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    When Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute, it required that every collective bargaining agreement have a grievance procedure ending in binding arbitration. 
    Congress also specified the kinds of disputes that can be brought under that grievance procedure. 
    A dispute over whether IRS violated OMB Circular A-76 when IRS contracts out the jobs of bargaining unit employees comes within that authorized scope that Congress specified for a negotiated grievance procedure.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Englehart, what's your answer to the Solicitor General's argument that when the Section 7106(a) defines management rights it says nothing in this chapter shall detract from it, and that the definition of grievance is in this chapter?
speaker="robert_j_englehart" startTime="1405.907" stopTime="1441.173">
    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    Yes, the Authority does not see a conflict between the command of Section 7106 and the grievance procedure. 
    7106 begins "Nothing in this chapter". 
    The next words are "shall affect the authority". 
    The Authority's position is that the management authority, protected from other aspects of the chapter, is the authority to make determinations in accordance with law, rule and regulation affecting conditions of employment. 
    That it does not give extra protection or different protection... separate protection for illegal exercise of management rights.

    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    Well, we note that IRS does not contend that laws is limited to congressional enactments, that it includes laws, rules and regulations. 
    IRS, until its reply brief, did not contend that there was any difference between the laws, rules and regulations encompassed within that phrase from the law, rule and regulation referred to in the definition of grievance. 
    Only now, in the reply brief, do we see the suggestion that the applicable laws reference would be more narrow. 
    We're not told why the Circular cannot qualify as a rule or regulation for applicable law purposes, if it can qualify for rule or regulation for the definition of grievance. 
    And in the absence of legislative history either defining applicable laws or determining how it should be construed, there seems to be no basis to compel a construction of applicable laws that is more narrow.

    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    I understand, Your Honor. 
    But the fundamental difference why the Authority does not find applicable law as a question that is controlling in the case, is because the Authority does not see a reason to have an escape clause from Section 7106, if you will. 
    There is no conflict when grievance determinations are only allowed to affect management action that violates law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment. 
    A critical point in the case is that management does not contend it has the authority to arrive at determinations that violate law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment. 
    IRS does not contend that it has this authority. 
    Therefore, determinations, and the Authority reviews these determinations for compliance with law, rule and regulation... that is part of the Authority's job... determinations which are limited to stopping that exercise of management right don't affect the Authority. 
    I would emphasize for this Court that in no other case, dealing with no other management right, has a court ever been urged to find that grievances are prohibited over the exercise of a management right, other than in the area of contracting out. 
    We have this argument in this case that... by IRS... that asks that we find that Congress put two provisions of the statute in collision.

    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    We would argue that, for purposes of whether it is a law, rule or regulation under our statute, one looks at the overall effect of the regulation. 
    That certainly is to be taken into account, but it shouldn't be controlling--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1797.467" stopTime="1801.190">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You are really just picking and choosing what you want out of the Circular, aren't you?
speaker="robert_j_englehart" startTime="1801.190" stopTime="1946.728">
    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    --Well, the grievance procedure is not an aspect that management uses in exercising its determination to contract out. 
    The grievance procedure is something under the Circular that has afforded directly affected parties to challenge compliance with what the Circular would appear to concede are mandatory and non-discretionary aspects. 
    All that the statute does is latch onto binding rules and regulations in the Federal Government, regulations, provided that they affect conditions of employment. 
    And that is a very narrowing term. 
    This grievance procedure is not about to latch onto rules and regulations and laws that have no relationship to the conditions of employment. 
    And we don't see that IRS is contesting that aspect of the case. 
    This would appear to be a law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment. 
    I would like to emphasize one important point that is being raised by IRS, latter in the case, is a suspicion about the intent behind the grievance procedure, that because it is in a definitional provision of the statute it perhaps is an inadvertent or unintended reference. 
    The legislative history of the statute shows the Congress was very well aware that it was defining the scope of the grievance procedure by use of this definitional provision. 
    The House committee report references the fact that the definition of grievance is broad, but that Section 7121(c) of the statute is a limiting term on the scope of the grievance procedure. 
    And, if you'll notice in Section 7121(c), a small portion of management rights do appear there, so that management didn't think that just by making something a management... I am sorry, so that Congress didn't think that just by making something a management right it also made it non-grievable. 
    The conference committee report also stated that unless the parties agree otherwise, and obviously IRS is perfectly well equipped to do so, to bargain at the table for a narrower scope, the intended scope of the grievance procedure was a broad one. 
    The suggestion that the grievance definition is not to be trusted, I believe underlies a basic unfamiliarity that IRS has with this statute. 
    The other cornerstone is the collective bargaining obligation. 
    In Section 7114 of the statute just says under our law have a collective bargaining agreement. 
    One has to go to three separate definitional provisions, collective bargaining agreement and then collective bargaining and then conditions of employment, before the contours of that bargaining obligation even begin to surface.

    That would be, obviously, the test. 
    In the example that you gave, I think that there would also be competing considerations, the kind of considerations that you see in Authority case law in the contracting out area, that would be... that would recognize that the scope of review that arbitrators are allowed to entertain, and the remedies that arbitrators are allowed to fashion are very limited, given the nature of the right. 
    In this case it is important to recognize that we no longer have any legitimate complaint from IRS over what the grievance procedure does in these cases.

    --To win we rely on two points. 
    The scope of the grievance procedure is commanded by the language and the specific intent of Congress, and that the Circular is a law, rule and regulation affecting conditions of employment. 
    Just those two points.

speaker="robert_j_englehart" startTime="2304.049" stopTime="2356.678">
    Mr. Robert J. Englehart 
    I don't believe we do, Your Honor, because we don't attach the significance to that phrase as defining the scope of the grievance procedure. 
    We believe the grievance procedure defines that scope. 
    Let me give you this hypothetical. 
    If applicable laws were used to define grievances that would suggest that you could never grieve the exercise of a management right that appears in (a)(1), there are a number of rights there, or that appear in (b)(1). 
    Or that you couldn't have a provision in your contract that required compliance with any kind of law for an (a)(1) right or a (b)(1) right. 
    The Authority case law is to the contrary, and we would note that Judge, now Justice, Kennedy's decision in U.S. Marshall Service, decided... cited at page 29 of our brief, suggests just the assertion of a 7106(b) right does not preclude a grievance. 
    Grievance is a specific intent and specifically defined by Congress.

    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    No, we certainly could. 
    Let me explain to you why... why we would want to make such a proposal. 
    It is common practice in the Federal sector to incorporate important regulatory provisions right into the contract. 
    That... that's just the way things are done. 
    So much of the employment relationship in the Federal sector, after all, is determined by laws, rules and regulations. 
    The contracts are largely enforced and administered by lay people. 
    It helps them to a great extent to have these very important laws, rules and regulations in the contract so that they can see what the relevant provisions are, so that they can be guided by them. 
    Furthermore, it helps employees because it puts the employer agency on notice that this is a rule... this is a regulation that you are going to have to follow. 
    And we hope that it thereby encourages compliance with these kinds of rules and regulations. 
    And furthermore, as my friend with the FLRA has already pointed out, it helps avoid future disputes about whether something is arbitrable. 
    So there are very sound practical reasons why we would make such a proposal, and indeed it is every day practice in the Federal sector. 
    Next, let me address the IRS' contention that the applicable laws language in 7106 should be read to have a narrower scope than laws, rules and regulations. 
    We have heard them concede today that the A-76 Circular is indeed a rule within the meaning of the grievance procedure, but they say that is not good enough. 
    They suggest that we have to show something more than that. 
    And we would submit that that is untenable. 
    There are many rules, many rules in the Federal sector, for example those in the Federal Personnel Manual, that have always been routinely grievable, but under the IRS' construction of the statute, they would read applicable laws to cancel out the express statutory right to file grievances over those rules. 
    To put it a somewhat different way, under the IRS' construction of the statute, and we believe it is a rather strange one, it would mean that the agency actually has a right to violate rules and regulations that do not meet its definition of applicable law. 
    And we would say that that is an untenable... an untenable view of the statute, indeed. 
    Finally, let me add that even if the government, the IRS, were somehow correct here, that we had to demonstrate that the Circular was a regulation with the force of law, that is, a substantive rule or a legislative rule, and we would emphasize that we do not believe that that is our burden here, but even if that were correct we would strongly suggest that we meet even that most stringent test. 
    And let me explain why. 
    First of all, what we have here is a Circular that was issued pursuant to statutory authority. 
    It is unquestionably binding on executive agencies. 
    They gave notice, they asked for comment, they held hearings and, perhaps most important, they incorporated the provisions of A-76 right into the code of Federal regulations within the subpart that describes the Federal acquisition regulations. 
    If that isn't a substantive rule or regulation, I suppose I am not sure what is. 
    So, for these reasons we would say that by any stretch of the imagination the A-76 Circular is indeed a law, rule or regulation within the meaning of the grievance procedure, which we would submit controls here, or it is an applicable law even under the IRS' most stringent definition.

    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    You have said that in the BATF case, Your Honor. 
    It is a well established principle of course that the administrative agency charged with interpreting the statute is entitled to deference, unless its views are clearly unreasonable. 
    And that clearly is not the case here. 
    Perhaps it would help me to spend just a moment to talk a bit about the relationship of the management rights clause and the grievance procedure, because I think that perhaps there is some uncertainty as to how these two provisions fit together.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Yes. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Just a few points. 
    First of all, if the FLRA's position in this case is correct, the union's bargaining proposal is not simply superfluous, it is far narrower than the actual matters that can be grieved and taken to arbitration, because it is not limited to matters covered by the internal appeals procedure. 
    It would embrace all matters within the Circular, and indeed any decision with respect to subcontracting. 
    Second, we have been, I think, accused of making several concessions that we have never made. 
    We do not concede that the term "applicable laws" is to be given the same meaning as the term "law, rule or regulation" elsewhere in the statute. 
    We believe that the FLRA's reading of the grievance definition is too broad, but we contend quite vigorously that, whatever the proper reading of that definition, the phrase applicable laws is considerably narrower in its purpose and scope.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    --Your Honor, if we start with the use of the phrase laws, rules or regulations in 7117, Congress indicated there that they regarded the phrase to be broad enough to include governmentwide policy directives. 
    They did not want the parties bargaining in matters inconsistent with governmentwide policy directives on any subject. 
    But when they use the phrase applicable laws in 7106, we contend that they meant only statutes and regulations having the force of law in the sense that they conferred enforceable rights and duties. 
    We do not believe that phrase embraces policy statements of the kind involved here. 
    Now, I think perhaps the critical difference between the IRS and the Authority here is with respect to the role the management rights provision plays. 
    As I understand the Authority's position, it is that all that the management rights provision does is to exercise constraint on arbitrators when they are deciding cases. 
    They should not interfere with managerial discretion. 
    We contend that the management rights provision, when it is fully applicable, must go to the threshold question of grievability, arbitrability, as well as negotiability. 
    That the management rights provision means that managerial decisions, whether they are discretionary or not, should not be turned over to a third-party decision maker. 
    And the... what happened in the Blytheville case, which is an example of the consequences of that kind of authorization, we believe strongly supports our position. 
    And indeed, Major Ketler, who discusses the Blytheville case in detail in the only study I know of this problem, agrees with us that there was in that case a significant arbitral interference which was upheld by the FLRA with the exercise of managerial authority. 
    In other words, the key to this case for us is that the management rights provision, when it is fully applicable, as it is here because none of the exceptions in the provision apply, that provision excludes not only negotiability but grievability and arbitrability.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    As a whole, Your Honor, I don't think I could answer that question.
