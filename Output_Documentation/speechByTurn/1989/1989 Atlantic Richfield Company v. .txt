    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Petitioner, Atlantic Richfield Company an integrated oil company, increased its retail gasoline sales and market share by encouraging the dealers to match the prices of independents such as respondent, USA Petroleum Company which competes directly with the dealers of petitioner at the retail. 
    When USA’s sales dropped, USA sued the petitioner, Atlantic, in the District Court charging that this was a vertical maximum price fixing scheme that constituted a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
    The District Court, however, granted summary judgment to ARCO holding that USA could not satisfy the anti-trust injury requirement for purposes of a private damages suit under Section 4 of the Clayton Act because it was unable to show what ARCO’s prices were predatory. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed holding that injuries resulting from a vertical non-predatory maximum price fixing agreement could constitute anti-trust injury. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that a vertical maximum price fixing conspiracy to be in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act must result in predatory pricing to cause a competitor anti-trust injury. 
    Justice Stevens joined by Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.
