    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before you today is may the police officers seize an object not listed on a warrant when it is in play view. 
    And I would start with when a seizure is made without inadvertence it is not made pursuant to a search. 
    Excuse me, it is not a plain-view seizure. 
    It is made, in fact, pursuant to a search. 
    So, we really don't even have a plain-view seizure here. 
    There is... and the facts in this case are, the police officers procured a search warrant. 
    When they did so, they carelessly forgot to include all the items for which they intended to seize. 
    When they entered the premises, they searched for the items irregardless of the fact that they were not listed in the warrant and, in fact, found the items that they were looking for, except for the items in fact listed on the warrant. 
    In order to find that inadvertence is not required in this situation, this Court would have to overrule Marron v. U.S. The facts there are indistinguishable from the facts here. 
    In that case, the police officers entered a business establishment with a warrant. 
    When they... this was in prohibition times. 
    One of the items listed on the warrant was liquor. 
    When they went in the closet in which they believed the liquor might be, they found ledgers and bills. 
    That court, seeing the issue which... as simple as it actually is... said that the ledger and bills were in fact not seized... not listed in the warrant and, therefore, not subject to seizure. 
    What the Attorney General of California asks this Court to do is to create a new exception to the warrant requirement. 
    The carelessness exception, the... Oh, my goodness, I forgot to get the warrant... particularly describing the items to be seized. 
    What that would do, it would nullify the particularity requirement of the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Fourth Amendment is too important to allow that to happen.

    Now, what if the officers in obtaining and seeking a search warrant lack probable cause to list some items on the search warrant and the affidavit and, therefore, they don't. 
    Now they go into the premises because they do list those for which they have probable cause. 
    They go in and they see the items.

    Not if the police officers intended to search. 
    The purpose of the warrant requirement... there would be no... police officers are required when they ask for a search warrant to particularly describe the items for which they intend to search. 
    At that point, it's up to the magistrate to make the decision. 
    If the police officers have no probable cause to search, they have no business searching for those items.

 How do you... how do you instruct these police officers when you send them out? 
 Let's... let's... you know, they... they know the thing's "a", are there, and... and they have probable cause so that's in the warrant. 
 Thing "b" they suspect may be there. 
 So, when I send them out with their warrant, what do I tell them? 
 Don't... don't look for "b" whatever you do. 
 How can you... can you erase from your mind the notion that "b" may be there? 
 I mean, this is a weird rule you're proposing for... for... the police have to act in some realistic fashion. 
 How can they possibly act that way?

    There's a difference in saying, we believe that "b" might be there, but don't look for it.

    You... Your Honor, you yourself in Hicks v. Arizona stated that the seizure and search... that one interest of the Fourth Amendment is not more important than the other. 
    In Place... U.S. v. Place, this Court stated that warrantless seizures are per se unreasonable. 
    As a matter of fact, in Coolidge itself Justice Stewart stated that even if the finding of contraband, stolen goods, or things dangerous in themselves are found without inadvertence, they may be seized.

    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    It's not a yes or no. 
    What it is is... whenever police officers, as the Attorney General concedes in his brief, the more items that the police officers intend to search for, the broader the search. 
    It's going to have to be. 
    The more police officers you bring in, the more invasion on the privacy. 
    We really don't know in this case if in fact the search was broadened because the police officers were looking for all of these other items that were not listed in the warrant. 
    You cannot say that on the facts that we have.

    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    Well, Your Honor, the initial motion made after the preliminary hearing was granted by the magistrate prior to binding Mr. Horton over for trial... the district attorney then filed the motion in the superior court to reinstate the evidence which was granted. 
    The court of appeals in California summarily dismissed the argument saying that North v. California does not follow the inadvertence requirement.

    Their findings, it seems to me, have to be looked at in the framework of... of that kind of debate in our Court.

    They entered the home in spite of the fact that it was not at... with the intention to search for these items even though they were not listed in the warrant.

    They were not conducting a legal search at that point.

    That's correct, Your Honor.

    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    --Well, that's a legal determination also. 
    It's a combination. 
    The courts have consistently held that the police have no discretion to decide what is to be taken, and abandoning the inadvertence requirement gives police officers this discretion. 
    There will be no need for them to request permission from a magistrate to search for each item for which they intend to search. 
    This will this nullify the warrant clause particularity requirement.

    --In United States v. Place, the language is that a warrantless seizure is per se unreasonable. 
    This Court cannot forget that there is also a possessory interest.

    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    However, in this case in the closing pages of the Attorney General's brief, he notes that the police officers relied on the fact that California does not follow the inadvertence requirement so they didn't think that it was necessary to bother going back and correcting the warrant before they entered the premises to conduct the search. 
    There's a problem with that. 
    There's a serious problem, and it starts with carelessness and then you have a deliberate bypass of the particularity requirements and the search and seizure law. 
    There will be no effect to the particularity requirement if this sort of conduct is permitted. 
    This case actually follows Leon. 
    In Leon the... this Court held that a good faith search and seizure, the seizures that were obtained in a good faith search, will not be suppressed. 
    There this Court stated, that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to deter magistrates. 
    In this case there is no error by a magistrate. 
    The error was simply that of the police officers. 
    Furthermore, Leon also states that police officers may not rely on facially deficient warrants and describes a facially deficient warrant as one failing to particularly describe the items to be seized. 
    That's exactly what we have here. 
    If this Court is going to follow the language of Leon, this Court cannot uphold this search. 
    Finally, the only effective available way to ensure that the warrant clause is taken seriously is to enforce it by suppressing evidence when it is thought... when the warrant clause is violated. 
    Police should know that the warrant clause is not a mere technicality which can be avoided when inconvenient or carelessly forgotten.

    Thank you, Ms. Drous.

   Argument of Martin S. Kaye
speaker="martin_s_kaye" startTime="1613.129" stopTime="1668.117">
    Mr. Martin S. Kaye 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to begin by citing to the Court the Joint Appendix at page 29 where the officer who conducted this search is asked, 
    "When you searched the residence of Mr. Horton were you looking for that jewelry, that stolen property? " 
    "Yes, I was". 
    "In the course of that search, did you come upon some weapons that you based... that you based your discussions with the victim on? " 
    The scope of the search has never been challenged in this case. 
    It was not challenged on appeal and it is not challenged in this Court. 
    It is only the inadvertence requirement that is raised here. 
    Second of all, I'd like to correct something that Justice White said.

    Mr. Martin S. Kaye 
    Sure, I'm assuming probable cause. 
    To ensure that the scope of the search will be to the greatest extent possible. 
    The purpose of the inadvertence requirement as announced in Coolidge was to enforce two distinct purposes of the warrant clause. 
    To eliminate altogether searches without probable cause and to limit the scope of searches deemed necessary to the smallest extent possible. 
    Neither of those purposes was violated in this case. 
    The police obtained a valid warrant for three rings, particularly described rings. 
    They confined the scope of their search to the area and time authorized by the warrant. 
    They had a lawful basis to be where they could see the other property. 
    There was no general search in this case. 
    In fact, I would point out to the Court that the facts show that there were a number of other firearms that were found in the premises that were not seized because they did not fit the description in the affidavit. 
    I think it's useful to examine Coolidge in its historical context. 
    At the time of Coolidge the Court was deeply divided over two issues, the broad scope of searches incident to arrest and the allowance of searches... of arrests in the home without a warrant. 
    Hence, the basis for... hence, the basis for the citation to Trupiano in Coolidge. 
    Neither of those concerns are present anymore. 
    In Chimel v. California the scope of searches was limited to a small extent to the reaching area of the defendant, and in Payton v. New York, the Court required a warrant for an arrest in a home. 
    Therefore, there is no danger of the police planning to arrest someone, waiting until he goes into his home, and then permitting them to make a very broad search without any warrant whatsoever. 
    In our view, the probable cause requirement protects Petitioner's interest in the possession of these items. 
    Unlike an unlawful search, the rupture of privacy cannot be repaired. 
    But property can be restored to the victim. 
    If the police are required to return for a warrant, Petitioner's interest in possession would still be interfered with to the same degree. 
    Stationing an officer to guard the property from loss or destruction while the warrant is sought means that Petitioner would still be deprived of possession or use of that item. 
    And, in fact, if stationing an officer there is required in order to guard, then the privacy intrusion would be extended. 
    It seems an odd way to protect the Petitioner's rights to extend the intrusion on his privacy. 
    In Texas v. Brown, the Court indicated some concern with a pretext search. 
    If that is the case, the Court ought to meet it squarely rather than through use of the inadvertence requirement. 
    The Coolidge requirement does not apply to contraband, stolen property or items dangerous in themselves. 
    Therefore, many pretext searches are not even included in the requirement. 
    Second of all, if inadvertence is to mean the lack of probable cause, then an officer who obtains a warrant to search for evidence of crime "a" purely as a pretext to look for evidence of crime "b", would not be deterred because if there was no probable cause for the evidence of crime "b", the seizure would be inadvertent.

    --No, I'm not conceding it. 
    To the contrary. 
    In Scott v. United States, the Court indicated that the officers underlying intent and motivation is irrelevant to the ascertainment of whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation. 
    That is to be measured by the objective conduct and if... the conduct in that case would be objectively reasonable because they would have had a search warrant in the first place. 
    The inadvertence requirement sweeps too broadly. 
    It would include searches as the present case in which there is no hint of pretext. 
    Here the police revealed all the information they had to the magistrate.

speaker="martin_s_kaye" startTime="2127.915" stopTime="2200.076">
    Mr. Martin S. Kaye 
    Precisely. 
    It's... the Court would get into the thicket. 
    As it put... put it in Leon, the Court is not inclined to get into an expedition into the minds of police officers. 
    The Court viewed it as a grave and fruitless misallocation of resources. 
    And the Court... if there was more than one motivation, then the Court would be having to determine which one was the dominant motivation. 
    The courts are simply not equipped to make such determinations. 
    The inadvertence rule punishes the police for oversight or miscalculation of probable cause. 
    The error in this case is benign. 
    It's not deliberate, it's not pretextual. 
    The Court has said that the police do not have to guess at their peril the precise moment when probable cause exists. 
    The inadvertence rule places the police in just such peril. 
    In this case, the police were properly on the premises and they had probable cause for their seizure. 
    We would submit that under those circumstances there simply is no basis to suppress the evidence.

    The rings were never found.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Kaye. 
    Ms. Drous, do you have rebuttal? 
    You have four minutes remaining. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Juliana Drous
speaker="juliana_drous" startTime="2240.647" stopTime="2396.480">
    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    Thank you. 
    First of all, Mr. Kaye starts reading from the record at page 29. 
    However, immediately before that, on page 27, the question, 
    "When you went to that residence, what were you looking for? " 
    Answer, 
    "I was looking for items that were from Mr. Wallaker during the robbery itself. " 
    "I was looking for items that would connect the person at the home to associate with the robbery, things used in the robbery to obtain the property, weapons, so forth, clothing. " 
    Clearly, we are not talking about here about going into police intentions. 
    We are going into what the police actually did, the conduct of the police. 
    In this case it is very easy to ascertain in that the police themselves testified as to what they did, that when they went in, they searched for these other items. 
    Second of all, regarding the suggestion that the remedy here of allowing the police to secure the premises while the... while they would go and get the proper corrected warrant, that would not be a remedy in this case. 
    Segura... when you look at the facts in Segura in which this Court allowed the securing of private premises in order to obtain a warrant, that is... also, they don't say... I don't believe the words were ever used, but in fact, it's good faith. 
    And that case the... it was at a late hour, a magistrate was not available to obtain a warrant. 
    The implication is that the police were worried about losing the evidence and that fairly somewhat quick action had to be taken so they went and secured the premises and then got a warrant. 
    That is good faith. 
    Again, when you come to this case, there is no good faith. 
    What there is is police negligence, police carelessness, and police officers should not be allowed to an... extend an intrusion which was the result of their own mistake, their own carelessness, their own deliberate disregard of the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. 
    Secondly, although we do not have the facts in this case, it is correct that the inadvertence requirement covers two situations. 
    One where there is a warrant and items are seized that are not listed in the warrant and, second, where there is an arrest. 
    The difference between Payton... Payton would not cover the situation because in Payton you have an arrest warrant allowing the entry into the home. 
    What Coolidge talks about... I'm sorry, there's no... what Payton says is that you cannot enter a home without an arrest warrant. 
    The situation that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2396.480" stopTime="2399.022">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Yeah, and you can't search within the home with an arrest warrant.
speaker="juliana_drous" startTime="2399.022" stopTime="2399.192">
    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    --That--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2399.192" stopTime="2401.575">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You can find the defendant and that's it, isn't it?
speaker="juliana_drous" startTime="2401.575" stopTime="2484.509">
    Ms. Juliana Drous 
    --Absolutely. 
    That's... that's Payton. 
    However, there is nothing in Payton to protect individuals from police officers obtaining an arrest warrant in order... allowing them to go into the home to arrest the individual and waiting for an opportune time when they have a feeling that evidence might be there. 
    And that's where inadvertence is still necessary. 
    In that situation, in order to protect Fourth Amendment rights. 
    In this case, we do not have a simple oversight or miscalculation of probable cause by the police. 
    What we have is out and out forgetfulness, carelessness in not listing... that... that is the only explanation. 
    In fact, that's the explanation given in the court as to why the items were not listed on the warrant, were not... why the affidavit did not request that the court include those items in the warrant. 
    And what you do have here... in fact, you do have a general search if a general search is defined as going in and searching for everything that the police want to look for, and that is not allowed by the Fourth Amendment. 
    The inadvertence requirement is necessary to protect Fourth Amendment rights. 
    I would submit it.
