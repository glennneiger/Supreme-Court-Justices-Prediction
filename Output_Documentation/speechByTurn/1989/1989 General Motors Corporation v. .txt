    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves central issues concerning the adoption and the enforcement of state air control regulations under the Clean Air Act. 
    The question presented is, in a case where a state has revised its regulations, whether EPA may bring a suit to enforce the original unrevised regulations and to collect penalties without first complying with its statutory duty to act to approve or disapprove the revision. 
    We request that the decision below be reversed because it allows EPA to veto state regulatory choices through an enforcement mechanism without following the procedures and requirements of the statute. 
    We submit that this procedure EPA is following creates a regulatory limbo which frustrates the efforts of states and companies to respond to changing conditions. 
    Now, I want to clarify at the outset that our point is not simply that EPA took too long in acting on the revision in question here. 
    Our point is a more fundamental one than that. 
    We submit that Congress established a very careful sequence in the statute, first, for the state promulgation of state implementation plans and revisions to those plans, secondly, for limited and timely EPA review of those plans and, only after that, for enforcement. 
    We submit that by skipping that second step, the limited and timely review, EPA has put the cart before the horse, if you will. 
    Now, in this case, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts gave General Motors an extension of time, from 1985 to 1987, 1987 being the attainment deadline in the Clean Air Act that's relevant here and, indeed, it was the deadline for all of Massachusetts, as granted by EPA. 
    The purpose of the extension was to allow General Motors to replace an older painting facility that it had in Framingham, Massachusetts and instead to build a new more modern facility with substantially lower emissions. 
    EPA had previously approved similar extensions of time through state plan revisions for other companies in 1984 and 1985, and the Agency did so pursuant to a policy that it had announced in 1981. 
    In this particular case, EPA waited while General Motors built its plant. 
    It completed the new facility at great expense in July of 1987, and then when the new facility was built and the old facility was shut down, EPA filed a lawsuit in August of 1987 to collect penalties for the period of time during which the company had operated the old paint shop. 
    It did so without taking any action... any final action on a revision. 
    Now, we submit that General Motors should have been entitled to comply with the Commonwealth's revision and should have not been penalized for doing so until EPA took action on the revision.

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    Your Honor, it seems to us that the government's argument with respect to that section proves a little bit too much, and it's somewhat a mechanical and artificial reading of the statute. 
    And the reason we say that is because it does not deal with EPA's corresponding duty under the statute to comply with its obligations to review a plan in a timely way. 
    We submit that the Congress--

    --The language of the statute, I think, Your Honor, we have to be careful not to try to parse it a little bit too fine but to look to the overall intent of it. 
    In our reply brief we pointed out one example where EPA does not interpret the language to refer only to the requirements of the plan. 
    And in particular the first sentence of Section (a)(2) states that the administrator may approve or disapprove a plan or a portion of a plan. 
    There is no reference to a portion of a plan in Section (3)(a).

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    I really don't. 
    I think it's a very strained reading for the government to say that every provision of (a)(2) is incorporated in (a)(3) with the exception of the four-month rule. 
    And if you go word by word almost to see what provisions the government believes are incorporated and which are not, they believe that everything is incorporated except the four-month rule. 
    I don't think that there's any indication in the statute that Congress intended to carve out that one provision. 
    And we think that all of the lower courts and all of the amici that have filed briefs with this Court are correct in assuming that Congress intended that. 
    And we think that the proof of the pudding is Section 110(g) of the Act, which we've pointed out in our brief requires EPA to comply with the plan revisions... to act on certain plan revisions, quote, (a)(3).

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    What that leads to is this, Your Honor, and this is the point I was trying to make a moment ago. 
    Under the Court's decision in the Train v. NRDC case, EPA must approve a revision if it satisfies the basic requirements of the statute. 
    And what EPA has done here is that they've invented a new option. 
    What they do is they exercise a pocket veto by ignoring a revision while bringing a suit to enforce the old plan. 
    This, in effect, disapproves the revision without any of the restrictions on EPA authority that are in the statute. 
    And indeed, it provides incentives for EPA to delay further in order to advance its enforcement action. 
    Now, by proceeding in this way, it seems to us, that EPA is leaving the states and industry in a regulatory limbo. 
    It undercuts state efforts to develop and enforce revised plans for improved control strategies. 
    It removes any incentives that industry would have to accept and implement revisions that would make progress. 
    And we submit that these consequences are totally inconsistent with the goals of the Act, and they are inconsistent with the basic obligation that EPA has in the statute where it says the administrator shall approve any revision. 
    And even if it's not four months, even if it's a reasonable time, he's obligated to approve that revision if it meets the basic requirements of the Act because the states have the primarily role in establishing a mission limitations. 
    And by exercising this pocket veto what the Agency is doing is writing the states out of the statute and saying we're going to ignore what you do and we're going to bring enforcement action to enforce our choices and not yours.

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    That was the remedy that the court of appeals suggested... or, at least one of the two remedies that the court of appeals suggested, Your Honor. 
    And we respectfully suggest that that's not very meaningful. 
    Let's think about what would be involved in doing that. 
    Under the government's approach, the district court would be required to consider whether the revised plan was, quote, 
    "clearly approvable or clearly not approvable. " 
    and it would be doing so well before the Agency itself had acted. 
    For example, in the Cyanamid case which we rely on heavily in our briefs, that was a 1982 plan revision. 
    The court of appeals handed down its decision in 1987 after a full round of administrative proceedings concerning the amount of the penalty. 
    To this day there's been no final decision by EPA on that SIP revision. 
    It seems to us that this approach of requiring a district court judge to make a decision as to whether a plan was clearly approvable or not really turns notions of primary jurisdiction on their head. 
    The Agency should be making that determination first. 
    And that's the basic problem that we've got.

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    No, Your Honor, we go a step further than that. 
    Our position is that EPA has a fundamental duty under the statute to first act on the revision, up or down, before it brings an enforcement action. 
    And we're not going to ask the district courts to look at whether there was a reasonable time on the four-month rule. 
    We think that the four-month rule is very important because it underscores the urgency of EPA to act, but there can be no question to us that the statute imposes a mandatory duty on EPA to act on those plans and that they should be prohibited from bringing an enforcement action.

    Your Honor, there is not a particular provision in the sense of language saying that EPA may not bring an enforcement action. 
    However, we suggest that... several things. 
    That the mandatory in the language in the statute saying that they are obligated to approve, the language in the statute saying in several places... in the preamble to the case and to the statute in the declaration of findings and purpose... that the prevention and control of pollution at its source is the primarily responsibility of the state and local governments, and in Section 7407(a) which says that each state shall have the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its entire geographic area. 
    The states don't have that authority if EPA is allowed to just ignore state plans, pick and choose among revisions and original plans, and if it prefers the original plan rather than the revision for any reason or no reason at all, without following the statutory procedures, to just go ahead and enforce the original plan. 
    We submit that that is so contrary to the fundamental workings of the statute that this Court should devise a remedy to deal with that situation.

    --The Clean Air Act... the way it's structured, Your Honor, requires that before a state submits a plan to EPA that it be adopted as a matter of state law and they be able to show EPA at the time that it's submitted that it's been promulgated and enforced. 
    And the states go through substantial procedures of their own to establish these revisions. 
    They're required by statute to have public hearings. 
    And in this case Massachusetts did have hearings. 
    The public was invited; the American Lung Association appeared and did not object to the revision. 
    EPA had advance notice of this. 
    These revisions aren't a surprise. 
    EPA had been talking to the Commonwealth about this; they appeared at the hearings. 
    They had some technical comments, but they did not object. 
    Massachusetts believed that it satisfied all of its concerns, and after considering all of the concerns of interested parties and the public, the state decided that it was in the best interest of the citizens of the state to go ahead with this revision, to allow General Motors to build a more modern, lower emission facility and extend the deadline to the statutory deadline that EPA had already approved.

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    We would urge the Court to not read Section 110(g) as an exclusive remedy, basically, which is our second provision. 
    There are a number of provisions in the statute, 110(g), 110(f), that provide for special relief. 
    In fact, the Train case, which we rely very heavily on, involved just that kind of an issue. 
    There was a provision for certain kinds of variances in the statute that the State of Georgia wanted to provide. 
    But the State of Georgia wanted to do it by a SIP revision rather than using 110(f). 
    And they said that that was the exclusive provision in the statute. 
    If you could do it by a SIP revision, why have a SIP revision? 
    And this Court held no, that the SIP revisions are the basic mechanism under the Act for states to make these kinds of choices. 
    And the fact that Congress may have provided some particular remedies doesn't make them exclusive. 
    So we would say that the fact that Section 110(g) of the statute is there doesn't at all conflict with the remedy that we're urging. 
    In fact, in some way we think that since Congress never thought about this problem, it supports it.

    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    I think that the... my impression is that when we're talking about the original 70 Clean Air Act, that the states were trying to get the plans into EPA in a hurry, that EPA tried to act in four months. 
    I don't believe they acted in four months in every case. 
    And eventually EPA ended up approving and disapproving the various plans.

    --and the plan says A plus C and it's intended that there is some separate element, yes, certainly the Agency can enforce under that circumstance. 
    But basically where there's... to the extent that there's a revision, what we're saying is that the states can enforce the revision and EPA should be barred from enforcement. 
    And that bar serves as a salutary purpose. 
    It serves to encourage the Agency to act promptly so that there can be a consensus between the Federal and state governments as to what should be enforced. 
    If I may, I'd like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Lawrence G. Wallace
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1779.990" stopTime="1905.006">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to preface my remarks by pointing out that the time limitations that were specified in the Act in 1970 in order to get the states to make prompt submissions and EPA to move on them within four months were designed to get into place protections of the public health which were not yet in place under the previous versions of the Clean Air Act. 
    And enforcement authority was included in the 1970 Act so that these protections of the public health of the breathing public would be in place and enforceable. 
    The enforcement authority was given both to the EPA and to citizen suits, and citizen suits could also be brought by the states under the definition of who is a person in the Act who can bring a citizens' suit. 
    But the primary enforcement authority was in the EPA. 
    In order to bring a citizens' suit, the EPA first must be notified and the citizen suit can proceed only if the EPA has not brought a suit and is not diligently prosecuting it. 
    So that Petitioner's submission at oral argument would turn around the explicit priorities of the enforcement provisions as well as undermine the basic purpose of what after all was entitled the Clean Air Act, which was to get protections for the breathing public in place.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --I think the court of appeals reached the correct answer, which is, yes, with two qualifications. 
    One is that in determining what penalties, if any, are appropriate, all of these questions of the equities of the particular case will be taken into account in the penalty proceeding. 
    And the other is that mandamus actions do lie to get the EPA to act. 
    But I must point out that in this case the EPA has disapproved this proposed revision, so that it is not exactly Petitioner's situation that is posed in the hypothetical. 
    And as a matter of fact, a case is pending now in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in which Petitioner is challenging the disapproval. 
    We recount that in our brief. 
    So I'd like now to point out that if we analyze Petitioner's claim and the American Cyanamid rule adopted by the Fifth Circuit in relation to the statute that is before the Court, the extraordinary lack of legal footing for this claim is revealed. 
    And our analysis proceeds in five short steps, which I can summarize very briefly. 
    The first is that it is undisputed and cannot be disputed under this Court's decision in Train that Petitioner's legal obligation under the statute is to comply with the requirements of a SIP that is in place. 
    That's what the Court held in Train. 
    And here the SIP was adopted... the state implementation plan was adopted by Massachusetts and approved by EPA to address Massachusetts' very serious ozone problem. 
    Two, the Act explicitly confers authority on the government to bring an enforcement suit against a source of emissions for failure to comply with the requirements of the SIP.

    We've pointed that out in footnote 32 of our brief on page 29 and explained the enforcement policy that EPA has been following.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --EPA even testified in the state proceedings that it had doubts about it. 
    And there was considerable communication between the state and Federal authorities, as there should be. 
    This is an Act that contemplates cooperation between the state and Federal authorities. 
    Of course, EPA could not state a concluded view in the state proceedings, but it did certainly indicate its doubts. 
    And it urged the state authorities to pursue the course they did, which was to try to negotiated a so-called delayed compliance order, which would have required General Motors before making this major technological change to take some steps to improve the emissions situation as it was existing. 
    It would have set up a schedule of improvements. 
    But those negotiations failed.

    --Even if we thought it appropriate to prosecute everybody, it would be hard to devote the resources to that endeavor. 
    And the scheme Congress adopted is one which does not remove prosecutorial discretion and still confers the responsibility to pass on these proposed revisions. 
    And we think of it the other way around. 
    If somebody is making satisfactory progress, that's not the place to devote our limited enforcement resources, even though the progress may not be ideal and there might actually be legal liability.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, in this little analysis I thought I would mention these three more points. 
    Number three, the Petitioner is asking the courts to erect a bar to the exercise of the government's explicit enforcement authority even though no such bar appears in the text of the statute itself or is adverted to in any way in the legislative history of the Act. 
    Nothing is pointed to that shows that it was at all contemplated by Congress in enacting it. 
    And at least the American Cyanamid court... and Petitioner hasn't totally renounced it... that court based this judicially created enforcement bar on EPA's failure to complete regulatory action on a proposed SIP revision within a four-month period supposedly required by the statute even though that alleged four-month requirement also does not appear in the text of the statute and is not adverted to in any way in the legislative history of the statute. 
    And my fifth point in this brief analysis is that Petitioner seeks to justify its proposed judicial building of inference on inference here to supersede the statutory text on the ground that otherwise the Act's overall policy of state and Federal cooperation will be distorted to the prejudice of the states. 
    And yet Massachusetts, the state whose interests are involved here, joined by 12 other states, has filed a brief in this Court stating, for very cogent reasons... and I commend this brief to the Court's attention... that their interests are better served by the government's ability to enforce the Act according to its terms. 
    And it--

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --the entire authority that the Act places in the court of appeals in reviewing EPA's action in disapproving a proposed SIP. 
    It equates the role of the reviewing court reviewing administrative action under this Court's decision in Harrison against PPG Industries, with the proper role of the district court in one of these enforcement proceedings. 
    So, I would have to commend the Massachusetts brief as the better reasoned of the two briefs, with all respect. 
    Now, in developing a couple of these points briefly, there is a sixth point that I hope to make, and that is that even if it would ever be appropriate for courts to erect an enforcement bar in the circumstances I have outlined, it would not be appropriate here, in this Act it would be a misfit that would be out of phase with other provisions and policies of the Act. 
    Now-- 
    --Well, on that point, it is true that Section 110(g) creates just such an enforcement bar in a particular situation. 
    So it's not a totally wild suggestion. 
    It... it is... it is the fact that an enforcement bar in limited circumstances has been provided by Congress in the Act which, under this Court's jurisprudence, cuts more in our favor than against our point because it shows that Congress, when it thought it was appropriate, knew how to draft an enforcement bar, did draft an enforcement bar--

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --We suggest that the way that provision evolved may be an explanation of why there was a reference to a required four-month period. 
    The provision was dealing entirely with this temporary emergency suspension authority that it... it deals with and that was the focus of congressional attention. 
    And the conclusion that we have come to is that it contemplates that in those situations EPA should act within four months. 
    But it does not in terms impose a four-month requirement nor is there a requirement elsewhere imposed in the Act, nor was it adopted at the time the 1970 provisions that Petitioner is relying on were adopted.

    --it says, which the administrator has not approved or disapproved under this section within the required four-month period. 
    So it seems to us plain on the face of it that the governor's suspension authority arises if the administrator has not approved or disapproved within four months. 
    And it just doesn't precede that. 
    And that is why the court of appeals was correct in saying that this provision in 1977 indicated that Congress thought no enforcement bar would otherwise be available and Congress had to provide a limited enforcement bar for this situation of the temporary emergency suspensions. 
    And even there where they thought an enforcement bar would be warranted, they limited it to a four-month suspension.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    So the court of appeals felt that in interpreting the Act as not otherwise allowing the courts to impose an enforcement bar, it was reconciling the '77 amendments with the '70 Act. 
    In fact, the court of appeals really understated it because otherwise the '77 amendment would be that the temporary emergency suspensions would have only a four-month enforcement bar and other proposed revisions would have an indefinite enforcement bar.

    --We think... yes. 
    The answer is yes and we think that it evolved because there was a requirement at one time in the House version of that bill in 1977. 
    And there may not have been an adjustment in the statutory language. 
    But that has to be surmise on anyone's part. 
    The background of the... of the consideration of that amendment would suggest why it may be worded that way, Mr. Justice.

 You're clearly not even trying to meet the four-month requirement. 
 I mean, if it's a provision of law, you should be breaking your back to meet it. 
 But you come in here and say, well, you know, maybe it's four months, maybe it isn't four months, what do we care.

    --There are other obligations under the Act, substantive obligations in the way we're to handle these proposed revisions, which have to be reconciled with whatever time limit the courts might think is the statutory guide to regulatory action. 
    I... I... I will say that this question is getting explicit consideration in the current amendments, which are still in an early stage. 
    But the Senate committee, the Senate Environment Committee, has reported out a bill which is now on the floor of the Senate. 
    That bill is S. 1630, and for the first time it explicitly does have a time limitation for EPA's consideration of proposed revisions, and it's 12 months--

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, I... I'm-- 
    [Laughter] 
    --just pointing out that Congress is dealing with... with the question explicitly now, and it perhaps corroborates our point that our interpretation of the present Act is not so implausible that the courts would be justified in reading into it two provisions that are not there, one a four-month requirement and the other an enforcement bar. 
    Since neither the legislative history nor the text of the Act would support the erection of those requirements by the courts, the only possible justification would be that the Act would be so implausible without them that the courts have to feel themselves under a duty to impose them.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Not... not the first time. 
    Congress has many responsibilities, just as the EPA does and others in the government do. 
    Now, I want to point out in the very limited time that I have a very important point made in the Massachusetts brief, if I may, which is footnote 13 on page 23 of that brief, which is the most cogent point that has been made in response to the attempt to distinguish this Court's decision in Brock against Pierce County on the ground that here the enforcement authority would be barred only temporarily and can be regained after EPA takes action on the proposed revision. 
    And Massachusetts and the sister states point out very properly that the Act applies to a large variety of problems, including some that endanger human health, such as the carbon-monoxide problem, where hourly measurements have been required, that temporary suspensions would be... of enforcement authority would be an extreme misfit in this Act dealing with very serious problems of public health.

    --Well, still and all, we're talking about interpreting an act that applies to a variety of emissions, some of which are much more serious in their short-term effects than others, and mistakes are made in these submissions, and mistakes that can have serious consequences. 
    The citizens' suit provision is another one that--

    I think you've answered the question, Mr. Wallace. 
    Mr. Garrett, do you have rebuttal? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Theodore L. Garrett
speaker="theodore_l_garrett" startTime="3611.510" stopTime="3701.753">
    Mr. Theodore L. Garrett 
    Just a few brief points, Your Honor. 
    In response to the last point concerning emergencies, it should be understood that our position is that EPA does have authority under a separate provision of the statute to deal with those, and we would not claim a bar to deal with those kinds of emergencies. 
    Our request for a bar only deals with state implementation plans. 
    With respect to the commingling point and Mr. Wallace's comments about the government policy with respect to the negotiations of a DCO, the negotiations were simply that the government wanted GM to pay penalties as a price for getting the SIP revision. 
    They weren't asking GM to make any other improvements or do anything else. 
    They had just changed their policies on whether or not SIP revisions could be allowed for these purposes as a revision or whether a DCO with penalties was the appropriate remedy. 
    And I would urge the Court to look at the Hannish memo... it's a May 1986 memorandum by an EPA official that we've lodged with the Court. 
    It demonstrates the moving target problem in our brief. 
    Mr. Wallace said that the Cyanamid remedy, or the temporary bar on enforcement is an extreme remedy. 
    Well, we would submit to the Court that the mandamus remedy, or the First Circuit's remedies, are much more intrusive and extreme than the remedy that we propose.

    Thank you, Mr. Garrett.
