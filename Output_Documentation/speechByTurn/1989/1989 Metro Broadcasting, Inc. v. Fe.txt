Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 89-700, Astroline Communications Company v. Shurberg Broadcasting. 
    Mr. Wollenberg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="j_roger_wollenberg" startTime="21.996" stopTime="378.980">
    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to start... in light of the discussion in the previous case, before turning to the specifics of the Astroline case, I would like to start with a little more discussion of the nature of the Communications Act. 
    The Communications Act is unique in our governmental system. 
    It was essentially a structure invented by Herbert Hoover a long time ago, and it attempts to handle a dilemma of major proportions, which is the dilemma of the necessity of a licensing scheme for broadcast frequencies to avoid a total interference and total chaos, a licensing scheme which, since it goes over the whole country, must be federally applied, and the fact that the resulting broadcast activities have enormous First Amendment implications because the broadcasting industry is very, very significant agency for informing the American people. 
    And this has resulted in compromises, if you like, in treatment over the years that is different from other areas. 
    It is different from industries not so effective. 
    It is different from the newspaper industry, which doesn't have a licensing problem. 
    So way back in NBC v. United States, this Court said that the FCC is not a mere traffic cop. 
    It's concerned with the nature of the traffic, as well as its distribution. 
    This Court in Red Lion... excuse me... this Court in Red Lion upheld a very significant action by the Commission in requiring what was called the Fairness Doctrine, which meant in substance that if one side of a controversial issue was discussed, that it would be necessary to provide discussion of other viewpoints. 
    In other words, a diversity of viewpoints was imposed by the Commission and upheld by this Court in Red Lion. 
    Of course, that can be called content control. 
    It is not saying what position should be taken. 
    It is not a very precise or detailed form of content control, but it's a form of content control. 
    It was mentioned earlier today, the Listeners Guild case, and with deference, I think it was not accurately described. 
    The suggestion was that in the Listeners Guild case that this Court said that it is wonderful... not wonderful, it is appropriate for the Commission to leave entirely to the marketplace what goes out over the air. 
    A closer examination of the Listeners Guild case will reveal that the subject of it was entertainment programming and that the Court, in upholding the Commission's decision to leave entertainment to the marketplace, was not dealing with the nonentertainment aspects of it. 
    Now, it's perfectly true that the Commission over the years and to some degree the Court over the years have gone up and down on the question of the degree of intrusiveness which is appropriate and permissible on the part of the Commission in order to carry out what one of the arguments this morning referred to as the trustee notion of broadcasting. 
    It was suggested from the bench that what we are all in for is to make the maximum money and therefore the only test that will be applied by a broadcaster, regardless of origins, is to make the most money. 
    I would hope that there are other factors which enter into it, but be that as it may, I suggest that with the licensing necessity, and with the Communications Act and its structure having been upheld over the years, that the determination of that question is a question for Congress. 
    I think there has been unfortunately, today, because Congress isn't here except through an extremely impressive and comprehensive brief by the United States Senate... not a senator, but by the United States Senate... on the subject. 
    Because the Congress isn't here and the representative of the FCC is here, there is a tendency of the Court to treat this as an FCC matter. 
    It really, as the brief for the Senate shows and as Mr. Armstrong's argument made clear, it is not an FCC matter. 
    The FCC received large numbers of signals over the years that it should pay more attention to the composition of ownership of broadcast stations, and when the FCC adopted the policies that have been discussed this morning and then at a later time a differently composed Commission looked as though it was going to change those policies, Congress stepped in and very explicitly told it not to.

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    --Yes, and when we say equal protection component, we have to say component, because this Court, quite properly, read the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Fifth Amendment, just as it has read the Amendments to the Bill of Rights into the Civil War Amendments, and just yesterday there was a jury trial... I'm sorry, an election spending requirement of a state that was subjected to analysis under the First Amendment. 
    So I think it is one Constitution, now, and I think any notion that somehow or other the Congress has greater power in its own areas because of the Fourteenth Amendment, or needs to rely on the Fourteenth Amendment, I think is not well taken. 
    I think that the Congress is functioning here... there has been a good deal of discussion this morning on the question of remedial, and I think some of the terminology gets confusing, or imprecise, as to what kind of remedial we mean. 
    No one is contending--

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    --No, I think not, Your Honor. 
    I think the FCC stands here defending the requirement that Congress has imposed. 
    And contrary to the suggestion that Congress just late some night did something in an Appropriations Act saying don't change your policies, contrary to that suggestion, in Congressional Reports and testimony and so forth before Congress, the focus has been very definitely on diversity and on remedial in the sense that, not that the FCC has discriminated, not that broadcasters have discriminated, but that as a result of society-wide discrimination, which we all know about and which this Court has mentioned in a variety of contexts, that at the beginning at least there was an extraordinarily small percentage of broadcast ownership by minorities.

    I do. 
    The Senate report on the '82 Act said, 
    "A third important factor in diversifying the media of mass communications is promoting ownership by racial and ethnic minorities, groups which... that traditionally have been extremely underrepresented in the ownership of telecommunication facilities and media properties. " 
    "The policy of encouraging diversity of information sources is best served by not only awarding preferences based on the number of properties already owned, but also by assuring that minority and ethnic groups that have been unable to acquire any significant degree of media ownership are provided an increased opportunity to do so. " 
    "It is hoped that this approach to enhancing the diversity through such structural means will, in turn, broaden the nature and type of information and programming disseminated to the public. "

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    I think that's absolutely correct. 
    I think that that is true in jury cases, too, if, Your Honor please. 
    In other words, when the Sixth Amendment impartial trial is concerned, while the Court may differ as to whether it applies to the panel or the venire, the approach is that to have an impartial jury, some degree of representation is... is significant. 
    And that's a judgment which is not empirically demonstrable... demonstrable. 
    It is not something that can be proved. 
    It's thought to be a part of the concept. 
    And I think that the notion of having minorities in employment... it was mentioned earlier today that this Court, without disagreement on this point by any member of the Court in NAACP v.

    --The distress sale policy was not specifically mandated by Congress... not authorized, mandated by Congress until three successive budget acts, the '87 act, the '88 act and the '89 act, where it was made very clear that Congress, which I, with deference, I think was fully informed... maybe not everyone who voted for it was fully informed, but the relevant people were fully informed. 
    Congress made the judgment that we do not want those policies changed.

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    Not just to reconsider it or to change it. 
    I mean, it is absolutely explicit. 
    You can decide that Congress didn't make the kind of evidentiary findings which has been indicated from the bench Congress doesn't have to make, or you can say that it was wrong because it's not going to have anything to do with programming. 
    Or you can say that you can't prove that it did have to do with programming. 
    And there obviously is force to all of that, but, as the plurality opinion said in CBS v. DNC, which was another case that strongly indicated the importance of Congress and the Commission in carrying out the First Amendment aspects... interests of the act--

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    --Well, the FCC... when you say since that time, the FCC has unquestionably, with different members, been on both sides of the... of the case. 
    I think that this Court made very clear that there's a big difference between subordinate agencies and the Congress of the United States that supposedly represents us all, even if it sits at home making its decisions. 
    And the FCC, arguably, may be more like the school board in Wygant, or the city counsel in Richmond, or the Board of Regents of the University of California in Bakke, but we're dealing here with Congress. 
    And to say that the only thing that binds us... binds you... is the appropriations act, it's the only thing that directly relates to this... this case... but in terms of whether it was a considered decision and whether it should have the weight and deference that a considered decision that is reflective of the culmination of policy discussions over many years, it seems to me would be--

    Justice Scalia 
    Mr. Wollenberg, could I... let me tell you the thing that... that most troubles me about this case. 
    And maybe you can tell me how we can distinguish it from other situations. 
    If we accept in this case the legitimacy of making a prediction about a person's action on the basis of his or her blood, what other fields of public policy may we use that kind of a presumption in? 
    I know of no other area where we've allowed it to be done. 
    To say on... not as a remedial matter, but on the basis of predicting behavior, if a person is of a certain blood, he will put on a certain programming. 
    I don't know of any other field where we've done that. 
    Now, how can... if we adopt such a principle, and say that is legitimate for Congress or the FCC or anybody to do that, what other fields might... might we do that in?

    And I think that race in this situation is justified... remedial in the very broad sense that the groups that Congress has identified, and maybe it should have included Portuguese, but the groups that Congress has identified have really and truly not had an equal break in our society, and therefore, they may be somewhat isolated--

    When the fairness doctrine... when the other Commission activities were upheld, it was on the notion that they're going to make a try at assuring that broadcasting is representative. 
    When this Court in Bakke refused to uphold the injunction against considering race on the medical school class in Davis, it didn't like the quotas and the fixed numbers, it... it made a kind of a race-conscious statement. 
    The truth is, that while the Constitution may be colorblind, that race is with us. 
    And we read every morning in the newspapers about enormous new tensions related to race. 
    And it seems to me, to the Congress of the United States, on a considered basis, to say that it... it... it may help in our licensing field, and to avoid program intrusion, to open up this field to ownership of people who have been fairly conspicuously subjected to society-wide discrimination, it seems to me that that's what--

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In December of 1983 my client, Alan Shurberg, who is the respondent here, applied for a TV station in Hartford, Connecticut. 
    He's a lifelong resident of Hartford, and in 1984 the FCC refused even to consider his application because Mr. Shurberg is white. 
    At the same time, though, the FCC granted Petitioner Astroline's mutually exclusive application because one Richard Ramirez, a Boston resident who had been recruited to serve as Astroline's supposedly controlling general partner was said to be Hispanic-American. 
    That was the sole difference between the two applications and the sole distinguishing factor.

    Conceivably... actually, no, I don't believe that would be the case, Chief Justice Rehnquist. 
    We filed a petition to deny, obviously, raising a number of questions including the constitutionality of the distress sale. 
    And we had no other information... we had no information on which to challenge his... his racial or ethnic status. 
    We were certainly not willing to concede his racial or ethnic status without examination. 
    We had no discovery rights, we had no cross-examination rights. 
    We had only what we could dig up out and about.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    That's correct. 
    And also I should point out, Justice Kennedy, that this is a 1987 or 1986-87 document. 
    The more recent document on file with the FCC shows the total capital contributions by the so-called limited partner is in the range of $24 million, and Mr. Ramirez's remains at $210. 
    Now, that's... that's among the documents which we lodge with the Court as supplemental materials with our brief. 
    In acting as it did in 1984, the FCC stated that on balance the minority distress sale policy and the agency's general interest in increasing minority ownership in broadcast stations outweighed the statutorily mandated interest inherent in considering competing applications such as Mr. Shurberg's. 
    In so doing the FCC affirmed what the minority distress sale basically says on its face, and that is that white people need not apply when the minority distress sale policy is involved. 
    The FCC's action and the policy underlying it are the guts of our case at this point, and our argument is a simple one. 
    The Constitution prohibits racial discrimination by the government. 
    The distress sale policy is a governmental policy which discriminated against Mr. Shurberg on the basis of his race, pretty much under discussion.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Well, Justice O'Connor, I have to say I've sat through four separate arguments, four separate presentations this morning to the court, and I think the one lesson that I've learned is that there is no basis for saying exactly what the FCC was doing. 
    The FCC itself, as I believe you've noted in the last presentation, had specifically disclaimed here this morning that its minority ownership policies are remedial in nature, and we would tend to agree with that, although some of the briefs in this case have indicated that they believe there is some remedial component. 
    In any event, even if it were remedial and even if it could be said that there is some effort to correct remediation, it is not at all narrowly tailored to that purpose. 
    In other words, there's no showing... again, going back to what was shown in the application... all that was said is Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American. 
    It doesn't say Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American who has suffered discrimination, who has been the victim of any kind of disadvantage at all. 
    And the FCC policy specifically doesn't get into that. 
    In other words, it is not... even if it were remedial in nature... and we do not agree that it is... it is not at all narrowly tailored to correct remediation or, I'm sorry, to correct conceivable discrimination which has occurred. 
    Before I get into the substance of my argument I think it may be appropriate to... to discuss very briefly the standard of review because there has been a lot of discussion this morning, but not much directed to precisely what issues are before the Court. 
    As I understand the standard of review with respect to race-based governmental classifications, it is incumbent upon the proponent of that classification, whether it's an agency, local government or even the federal government to come forward and explain what in compelling governmental interest the classification is directed to, and then to... to demonstrate that, in fact, the classification is narrowly tailored with a good degree of precision to achieve that compelling governmental interest. 
    That... that, at least, is my understanding of the strict scrutiny standard. 
    Now, in this case, as I just mentioned to Justice O'Connor, there appears to be some confusion as to exactly what compelling governmental interest is supposedly being advanced. 
    And I think we can take as a given at least based on the Commission's presentation this morning that it is not remedial... a remedial purpose to... to correct past discrimination although I'm certainly happy to discuss that if anyone has questions. 
    Rather, what appears to be the Commission's position now is that it is... the distress sale policy in particularly in the minority ownership policies as a whole are directed to the advancement of program diversity, and that is the compelling governmental interest. 
    And the citation is to the First Amendment and the diversity of voices and a multiplicity of voices and so forth. 
    I want to say right off the top that Shurberg is not averse. 
    We do not dispute the value or the desirability, especially in a democratic society of diversity of voices. 
    A multiplicity of voices is clearly the way that our society has chosen to govern itself, and we support that. 
    Our problem is that race-based classifications are completely and utterly inappropriate and unnecessary for the advancement of that interest. 
    There is absolutely no rational connection at all between the asserted goal and the policy. 
    So from that point of view we would challenge the notion of... of... of program diversity as... as a valid compelling governmental interest.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Yes, there is. 
    [Laughter] 
    One problem or a threshold problem with the notion of program diversity, even assuming that there were some... some basis for it, is a valid, compelling governmental interest for strict scrutiny purposes is that this court has never approved race-based classifications just because they might achieve some good or desirable goal. 
    Such an approach would enable Congress to enact a wide variety of racial classifications. 
    As Justice Scalia suggested in questioning Petitioner's counsel, it is conceivable under the same rationale, program diversity rationale if it's accepted here, that ten years from now the Commission could state that... issue a policy statement saying that there are too few white upper-middle class classical music stations in the major urban areas and that, therefore, we're going to set aside a certain number of those for... in order to promote diversity in that respect because we see a lack there. 
    And again, if the policies are affirmed today, then presumably that policy would be affirmed as well. 
    By the same token, it is conceivable that this could extend outward to other important institutions beyond the broadcasting range. 
    For example, federal judgeships. 
    If it is desirable to have a multiplicity of... of people or representative voices in some... in some respect along those lines, then very conceivably it... that... that rationale could be extended to include--

    No. 
    This policy inquires only as to racial or ethnic status, and that's the end of the discussion. 
    And that brings me to the second objectionable aspect of... of... of program diversity as a compelling governmental interest. 
    It is based on a racist assumption. 
    It assumes that each racial or ethnic group has its own minority viewpoint and that that minority viewpoint will ultimately be reflected in Mr. Shurberg. 
    That is nothing less than a racist attitude which ignores individual traits and abilities and instead substitutes invidious stereotypes rather than consideration of the individual.

    Even if it were... supposing it weren't a presumption.

    Sure. 
    The need for programming as perceived by the actual audience itself is... is... is certainly a consideration which might be taken into account. 
    But again, the need for programming, for any particular programming, may not be racially driven. 
    Even though you interview 75 percent of the people in Washington, D.C. and in that survey obtain a... a skewed heavily toward blacks, even if they all happen to say, yes, we like X kind of music, that doesn't necessarily mean that all blacks... that that is racially driven. 
    That may be class driven, geographically driven, economically driven. 
    There are any number of other factors which enter into it other than race, and that's all we're saying, that race is irrelevant, and race should be irrelevant. 
    The range of viewpoints that... that are available in any particular race or ethnic group is, in our view, at least, similar if not identical to the equivalent range in other groups.

speaker="harry_f_cole" startTime="2867.616" stopTime="3011.761">
    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    That's correct. 
    The bottom line as far as the compelling interest is concerned, in our view, is it can be reduced to two questions. 
    Why is Alan Shurberg any less capable of increasing program diversity just because he is white, and why is Astroline any more capable of doing so just because it is... its supposedly controlling principal has a Spanish-sounding last name? 
    And I think that... that presents that point as clearly as I can. 
    I would like to proceed to the second aspect of the strict scrutiny standard, which is the narrow tailoring, that even if it is accepted for the sake of argument, that the program diversity is a valid, compelling governmental interest sufficient to support race-based classifications, it still has to be... the program still has to be narrowly tailored to meet that. 
    The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored in any sense, meaningful or otherwise. 
    The only requirement that needs to be... that is imposed on a minority distress sale applicant is that it is assert that it is minority controlled. 
    There is nothing about any program commitments. 
    The applicant does not have to show in his application what he expects to do or what he may do or what he'd like to do, and, in fact, as we've indicated in the... in our brief, the... what Astroline ultimately came up with in the way of programing in our view shows not a tremendous sensitivity to minorities. 
    Secondly, there is no limit on the number of other stations that might be owned by the distress sale applicant. 
    In other words, if I'm a distress sale applicant and I own 35 other stations, AM, FM and TV stations, I'm still qualified for an absolutely dispositive preference under the distress sale policy as against somebody who's white but doesn't own any stations. 
    This makes no sense as far as program diversity is concerned. 
    Second, there's... or third, there's no need for a showing of the need for the programming. 
    In other words, for example, assume a community with three radio stations, all of which are playing rock and roll music of a similar genre, and a distress sale applicant comes in and says I want to come in. 
    He's not required to show that he's going to anything other than rock and roll music of that genre. 
    There's no... there's nothing at the... at the door when he walks into the Commission to indicate to the Commission that program diversity will be increased in the least.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    --I would hope so, Your Honor, for that amount of money. 
    There's no indication required that the distressed sale applicant demonstrate an ability or familiarity with the local... an ability to serve the local community or familiarity with the local community. 
    This is a... a similar component is imposed in the comparative preferences area so that a white person who is a local resident of the area is deemed by the FCC to have the equivalent enhancement value as a minority who is not from the area. 
    There is no... that doesn't enter into the matrix in the distress sale policy. 
    If I might, there are alternative measures. 
    If the FCC really wants to get to minority... or, diverse programming, there is one very simple expedient which it could use. 
    It could say only... it could reduce to one the maximum number of stations that any individual or entity could own. 
    Just reduce it to one and say, that is all there is. 
    One per person, come and get them. 
    If the theory of program diversity is that the maximum number of owners leads to the maximum amount of diversity, that would be the way to do it. 
    It could be done on a race-neutral basis, and it could be done tomorrow. 
    The FCC has not done that. 
    To the contrary, over the last five years it has increased the number of stations that can be owned by any particular entity, almost doubling them from seven to 12, and in some situations as many as 14 can be owned. 
    That being the case, it would appear that the FCC is not as concerned about diversity as it would have the general public believe. 
    I would like to address very briefly the 3.5 percent figure, because I think it's an important one if the question of remediation arises at any point. 
    Ms. Polivy during the Metro argument referenced the fact that only 3.5 percent of the broadcast stations in the country are owned by minorities, and this is asserted in some of the briefs as a basis for concluding there is an underrepresentation. 
    I don't want the Court to go away thinking that that is in fact a valid assessment of the situation. 
    In fact, the congressional research study report indicates, I believe... and it's cited by the FCC in its own brief... that minority participation in the broadcast industry may be somewhere between 13 and 15 percent. 
    The 2 to 3.5 percent figure which is so frequently cited by the various supporters of the policy relates only to those situations in which the minority person or people exercise what the FCC defines as control of the license, control being defined as 50 percent or more ownership. 
    So that if a minority individual happened to own 49.9 percent of a chain of stations that amounted to 25, 35 stations, that ownership would not be reflected at all.

   Rebuttal of Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg
speaker="j_roger_wollenberg" startTime="3246.296" stopTime="3410.854">
    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    If the Court please: 
    I think it's important to realize that in the circumstances of this case, contrary to the suggestions of counsel, that Mr. Shurberg was not burdened because he was white. 
    He was not treated differently from a hypothetical black who at the same time that Mr. Shurberg came in had come in in the same fashion. 
    They both would have been turned down, because under the Commission's procedures, the time when the window opens for coming in against a renewal had passed. 
    So that when, after the 1977 renewal of Faith Center, which was the old licensee, after the time for that had passed, it was too late for someone else to come in, and if Mr. Shurberg had come in then, which he didn't, and someone else had come in then who was black, they both would have been turned down. 
    The Court below, while it found the Commission's distress sale unconstitutional... policy unconstitutional... I prefer to call it the congressional policy now, and in that regard I hope the Court will take the time to read the conference report on the '82 Act which is even more explicit than the Senate report that I was reading from. 
    Congress knew what it was doing, it knew it was remediation for society-wide discrimination and because it thought it would help with programming. 
    Counsel referred to some things not in the record about individuals. 
    I guess it's permissible for me to mention that in the last few days there was a story in the Washington newspapers about a conservative radio station where the personality made an invidious remark referring to an anchor person on one of the networks as "Connie Chink". 
    It's barely possible that if an Oriental had owned that station, that that at least would either not have been done, or might not have been repeated, and it's even possible if a Hispanic owned the station. 
    It's also possible if a white owned the station. 
    But sensitivity is something that I think, just as with juries, I think that Congress is entitled to some interest in sensitivity.

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    It made no necessary difference in the outcome as far as Shurberg was concerned, because if there had been no distress sale the Faith Center renewal hearing on qualifications would have gone through. 
    If Faith Center won, it would be renewed. 
    If Faith Center lost, then at that point Shurberg and everybody else in the world could come and apply. 
    So that would have made a difference, but it wouldn't necessarily mean that Shurberg would have gotten the station. 
    He never offered to buy it.

    Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg 
    Oh, no. 
    We didn't have to, because the court below... I'm glad you make that point, because this Court has admonished recently that you like to stick to what the petition is granted on. 
    The court below found that what the Commission had done was entirely appropriate under the Communications Act and its procedures and there was no violation of the act. 
    It held only that the distress sale policy was unconstitutional, and that's all that we're here on. 
    So we're not asking this Court to reverse the Court below on the question of whether Mr. Shurberg would have been allowed under the Communications Act to do something different. 
    What we're here asking is that this Court determine the distress sale policy is (1) nonrigid, nonquota, on very small... about four times a year, when a station is in trouble, the Commission may or may not permit a distress sale. 
    On one of the other Faith Center things it didn't. 
    It passes on each case, on its own facts, and if the distress sale applicant is qualified, if the licensee's putative sins aren't deemed to be too heinous and the distress sale applicant is fully qualified, the Commission may approve it. 
    It may not, it may go ahead and order a comparative hearing when, as and if the station comes up for regular renewal.
