McKoy v. North Carolina

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 88-5909, Dock McKoy, Jr. v. North Carolina. 
    Mr. Hunter.
speaker="malcolm_ray_hunter_jr" startTime="10.588" stopTime="107.861">
    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is before the Court on certiorari for the Supreme Court of North Carolina to review the Supreme Court of North Carolina's decision affirming Dock McKoy's death sentence. 
    This case is about the penalty phase instructions in that trial, and whether those instructions violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
    At the penalty phase trial in that case, the court instructed the jury that it must be unanimous to find a mitigating circumstance, and that if the jury was not unanimous on a particular circumstance it should answer that issue no. 
    Further, the court offered no instruction to the jury at the penalty phase urging them to try to agree if there were any disagreements, initial disagreements, about a mitigating circumstance. 
    Thus, the question that divided this Court in Mills is not present here. 
    The state concedes, and the North Carolina Supreme Court held, that the instructions in this case would require 12 jurors to find mitigation, but only one to reject it. 
    North Carolina, after Mills, is the only jurisdiction in the United States where this method of finding and excluding mitigation is still allowed. 
    In Mills this Court applied a well established rule.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="119.140" stopTime="133.882">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Hunter, is it your position that the Constitution requires the state to prove lack of mitigating circumstances?
speaker="malcolm_ray_hunter_jr" startTime="133.882" stopTime="151.464">
    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    No, it is not. 
    It is simply our position that it is unconstitutional to allow one juror to preclude the rest of the jurors from considering mitigating circumstances at... at the penalty, at the final sentencing stage.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="151.464" stopTime="160.681">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you do feel that the state may say to the defendant, you bear the burden as to the existence of mitigating circumstances?
speaker="malcolm_ray_hunter_jr" startTime="160.681" stopTime="175.363">
    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    I, frankly, I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor. 
    I know this Court is considering that question. 
    We're... there is a burden of proof in North Carolina on the defendant. 
    It is a preponderance of the evidence which we have not contested in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="175.363" stopTime="187.240">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So you don't... you don't disagree with, at least in your position here, that North Carolina may place the burden of proof on the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence to show mitigating circumstance?
speaker="malcolm_ray_hunter_jr" startTime="187.240" stopTime="203.405">
    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    We... we are not disagreeing in this case, no sir. 
    There... there is... was a burden in this case, and that is not the subject of our complaint. 
    Our complaint is that... is that that question can be resolved by one juror for the other 12, as it was in Mills.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="203.405" stopTime="220.909">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but it... it does seem to me, perhaps I am wrong, that there is a certain inconsistency if you say that the state may place the burden on the defendant to prove it, but... but then you say the question should be addressed to each juror.
speaker="malcolm_ray_hunter_jr" startTime="220.909" stopTime="283.140">
    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    No, I think it may be addressed to the entire jury, Your Honor, but then the entire jury has to find that fact truly unanimously. 
    The... the system that we have here is... as I understood the dissent in Mills, for example, the... the dissenters in Mills understood Mills to have a scheme where the jury had to be unanimous to find or to reject mitigation. 
    In other words, they had to agree about whether a mitigating fact either existed... it was either true or it was not true. 
    They had to agree. 
    And on that basis the dissenters felt that that was a constitutional instruction in the constitutional scheme. 
    In the North Carolina scheme, on the other hand, and as I think the... the Court in the Mills decision held the Maryland scheme, they interpret it to mean that 12 jurors were required to find that a mitigating circumstance was present, but only one juror could upset that mitigating circumstance... that is, to unfind it or to reject that mitigating circumstance.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --And again, our, Your Honor, our problem, the unconstitutionality in North Carolina, does not have to do with requiring the jury to be unanimous to find mitigation. 
    It is allowing them to reject that mitigation by only one juror. 
    And I think the examples that were given in Mills v. Maryland really illustrate the problem that also exists in North Carolina. 
    In Mills v. Maryland the two hypotheticals that were suggested there was that 11 jurors could believe that there was mitigation in the case, be convinced of it by a preponderance of the evidence, Your Honor, and yet one juror could say I am not convinced by a preponderance of the evidence.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    Your Honor, as... that is correct, Your Honor. 
    As to the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances which may be considered, and also as to the statutory mitigating circumstance of age that was submitted in this case, the jury did have to find two things. 
    So that, in this case, different from Mills, there are really two layers of possible arbitrary action by the jury. 
    All 12 jurors could agree that a fact is proven... they... so that the defendant has... has made his burden of proof on the question of fact, and 11 of them could find that it is extremely mitigating. 
    And in fact, so mitigating that they would impose a life sentence if they could consider that evidence. 
    But one juror can find, in the jury room, in secret, that that circumstance, to his mind, is not mitigating. 
    And on that basis, the evidence... the jury has to decide the case without considering that evidence. 
    And that can be so even though that 12th juror might believe there is some other mitigating circumstance in the case upon which basis that juror would vote for life. 
    But because that is not unanimous, all 12, if they were allowed to consider the mitigation each of the 12 believes, would vote for life. 
    But because of the unanimity requirement none of them would be able to consider that mitigation.

    --The difference is, Your Honor, is that in this case when jurors disagree, the 11 have to look at the case from that point on through the eyes of... of the one. 
    That... that's the difference. 
    If they could disagree and then bring that down to the final sentencing stage and say well, we disagree as to the basis, but we'll talk about it, and here is what we think the appropriate sentence is in the case, after being directed through the aggravating and mitigating circumstance. 
    That is the scheme that the vast majority of states, I believe, have.

    --Only if those 11 decide to join that one and say yes, it's second degree murder. 
    Only if they do that. 
    Now, if you have a system that requires the jury to be unanimous as to all the points, then there's going to be give and take, and one may convince the other 11. 
    But I submit to you that that is a much different case than the case where one can take a position, he has no duty or no interest in trying to convince the other 11 that his position is correct. 
    He can just black ball, he can just literally prevent them from considering that mitigation at the sentencing stage without any convincing. 
    If we had a true unanimity system in North Carolina then I think it would be like the system that the dissenters approved in Mills.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --That's exactly right, Your Honor. 
    But because North Carolina... and I don't believe the system for deciding aggravation is a reliable one either. 
    Because we have a system that in some cases would allow one juror to black ball aggravation in some cases, and therefore that defendant might get a life sentence who doesn't deserve it. 
    I don't think the cure for that is to allow black ball of mitigation in another case, in Dock McKoy's case, and... and allow a defendant to get a death sentence in a case where it is not appropriate. 
    You know, the... the requirement that the jury be unanimous as to aggravation and the requirement that the jury be unanimous as to mitigation was a decision that is not in our statute; it was a decision that was made by the North Carolina Supreme Court. 
    It is essentially judicial gloss on our statute; it is not required by the statute. 
    They... they simply made the decision in Kirkley, back in 1983, that that would be the appropriate way to go. 
    The problem with it, though, as shown in Mills, decided by this Court, is that it allows preclusion of mitigation. 
    It could allow the imposition of the death penalty despite the existence of factors which would call for a lesser penalty. 
    That was exactly the problem that was seen in Mills, decided last term--

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --Under that system there would be a hung jury, and I should add that in North Carolina where the jury can't agree the... the legislature has decided that that defendant should get a life sentence. 
    Maryland also used to have this same statutory scheme. 
    They thought better of it and changed it so that now in Maryland if there is a hung jury they go back and have another sentencing hearing. 
    If the state is concerned about reliability and concerned to the extent that they think that unanimity is required for a finding of mitigating circumstances, then there's a... there's a certain cost to that, I think, in efficiency. 
    There are going to be more hung juries if you have true unanimity. 
    But our point is simply if it is very important, for instance for this jury to decide whether Dock McKoy had a mental disturbance at the time that this crime occurred... well, it's important, the jury's decision that that is true is important, but the jury's decision that that is not true is equally important. 
    Because what they are deciding is not merely that a burden has not been met. 
    They are deciding Dock McKoy's life without consideration of any mental disturbance in the case. 
    So I think there should be equal concern for reliability in the decision that that mitigating circumstance is not present. 
    It... it seems to me all together arbitrary to allow one juror to dictate to the other 11 that... that fact, that question of fact, and that all 12 should either have to agree. 
    Or there is another suggestion that would be more efficient, and that is to allow... continue to direct the jurors to the mitigating circumstances, even let the jurors vote on the mitigating circumstances, but those jurors who do not command a unanimous verdict on a mitigating circumstance can simply consider that in steps 3 and 4. 
    In other words, just simply allow those jurors to consider the mitigation that those jurors would find, those 11 jurors would find, allow them to consider it at the final sentencing stage. 
    That, it seems to me, you lose nothing in reliability, and in fact I think that is a more reliable determination. 
    I think that determination about... about the defendant, where 11 of the 12 jurors agree on the fact, is much more reliable than a determination where only one of 12 agree.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --That is... that is really the second layer of arbitrariness that exists in the North Carolina system that did not exist in... in the Maryland system, as least as I read footnote 8 in... in the Mills decision, where all the jury was deciding in the Maryland case is... was whether the fact was proven or not. 
    And if they couldn't agree, then it was... the fact was out of the case. 
    But in this case a juror can do exactly what the judge did in Skipper, for example. 
    He can decide that some piece of evidence, some non statutory mitigating circumstance, is not relevant in his mind. 
    But instead of being done out in open court where every, where it will be recorded by a trained judge and where we can review it and decide that in fact that judge made an error, all we have is a... is a jury sheet that says the answer is no. 
    We don't know if it was on the basis of the facts or on the basis of the law. 
    And so it seems to me that, if anything, these jury sentencing states, like Maryland and like North Carolina, we should be more careful with the scheme so as not to allow this sort of preclusion, because it's essentially unreviewable. 
    If we have a scheme that allows it, there is no way to prove it after the fact.

    Do you think the Constitution requires that it be a set of questions and answers, rather than a judge's charge to the jury outlining the steps they should go through, and then just a verdict of death or life?

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --No, the Constitution does not require it. 
    I think, in fact, North Carolina's system is a lot more elaborate than it needs to be, but elaborate... being elaborate and being formal is not the same as being fair and being... being more careful about the defendant's rights. 
    And I think the way the North Carolina system can work is an example of that fact. 
    In fact, the statute itself does not even require any formal findings of mitigation. 
    Again that was decided by our North Carolina Supreme Court. 
    You could simply find an aggravating circumstance, narrow the case, ask the jury to consider the mitigation, and then go on and make your ultimate decisions. 
    The problem with the North Carolina--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    If you had a system without any findings, where the judge just charged on all the points and the jury came back with a simple verdict of either death or life, you... wouldn't have the basis for review that you're talking about.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --That is right, Your Honor. 
    That... and that would be one reason to perhaps have another scheme. 
    But I think a scheme that allowed the... either required the jury to be unanimous all the way or a scheme that said where you are not unanimous, those jurors can bring it down, it seems to me the North Carolina Supreme Court in reviewing the case would be interested to know, for example, that they were 11 to one in favor of one mitigator that they didn't consider. 
    And that they were nine to three in favor of another mitigator that they didn't consider. 
    That would just be additional information. 
    So, if the concern is for better recordkeeping, then... then... then that could certainly be accomplished by--

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    --The way that Maryland changed its sentencing scheme, even before Mills was decided, to allow... if it is just one juror, let that one juror bring it down and consider it in the ultimate sentencing phase. 
    And then there would be no exclusion. 
    In other words, you don't have to require unanimity both ways, that is not the only way the Constitution can be satisfied. 
    Another way the Constitution could be satisfied would be to allow the jurors to vote on mitigation, and then those that don't have a unanimous verdict, those jurors can still consider that mitigation at the ultimate sentencing phase. 
    In other words, it doesn't... and as I... as I said to the Chief Justice, I don't believe that you even have to have formal findings of mitigation at all to have a constitutional sentencing scheme, but what you can't have, what Mills held last term you can't have, is a scheme that allows the preclusion of mitigation by as few as one juror for all the rest. 
    That, it seems to me, is... and as the Court said, was the height of arbitrariness. 
    You know, if... if we look back at the Lockett cases, if... if we're making a decision as to who is better to make a decision about whether a circumstance is mitigating, for example, we won't let a judge do it for the... for the jury. 
    The... the... the... a single hold-out juror, it seems to me, is the worst possible person, if you are thinking of all the decision makers. 
    We won't let the legislature do it. 
    A single hold-out juror, it seems, is the worst possible decision maker to be in the position to make that decision.

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue here, as in several other cases now before this Court, deals with the state's right to have a sentencer rationally assess evidence, or plead for life sentence instead of death. 
    McKoy versus North Carolina specifically involves whether a state may hold the defendant to a burden of proving his mitigation with a reasonable certainty to the entire sentencing body, the jury. 
    In North Carolina, just as aggravating factors must be found by all jurors or they are considered not to exist, North Carolina has made the policy determination to have symmetry, so that likewise the mitigation must be found by all jurors, or it likewise does not exist.

    Justice O'Connor, I do not read the Mills case as holding that this type of system is per se bad. 
    I understood Mills to be concerned with the issue of ambiguous jury instructions in a very different system, a system where the no vote by one juror on mitigation could force a death penalty without any kind of further consideration of the appropriateness of the death penalty by the rest of the jury. 
    This is not present in North Carolina. 
    One juror in North Carolina can, at best, say that mitigation... that... that... that juror does not find that mitigation exists by a preponderance of the evidence. 
    One juror in North Carolina cannot mandate a death sentence.

    There is yet one more step, where the jury must determine unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating factor found by the jury... or factors found by the jury to exist, is sufficiently substantial to warrant imposition of the death penalty in this case. 
    So the jury still has that vehicle through which to give their reasoned, moral response, and determine whether or not, given the substantiality of the aggravating factor, death is in fact appropriate in this case.

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    Yes, in Maryland the failure to find mitigation mechanistically forces a sentence of death. 
    The jury cannot even vote about whether they consider the aggravating sufficiently substantial. 
    In Maryland the statute ends with the weighing process and does not go on to that fourth step. 
    North Carolina is unique, or almost unique, among the states in having this type of step. 
    Therefore, we feel that this kind of burden of proof does not raise any of the dangers of arbitrariness which possibly could have resulted from a Maryland burden of proof of this type. 
    So, for that reason alone we find it, a difference. 
    Further, North Carolina, as a matter of state policy unlike Maryland, has determined, as a matter of our state law, that evidence ceases to be used in the balancing process once it is found insufficiently reliable to support a mitigating factor. 
    And, as Justice Blackmun noted in footnote 7, the Maryland court had taken the opposite tack on that, so we say that this is another state law rule which does distinguish these cases.

    May I question you a moment about the distinction, because, supposing you have a case in which if you just look at the aggravating side you feel quite confident the jury would say this is a sufficiently serious crime that it justifies the death penalty. 
    But if the jury were to consider the fact that the defendant was 16 years old and had military service, say... or maybe he couldn't do that if he was just 16... but say two or three factors like that, and... and if they were in the balance there would be great doubt about whether there would, the aggravating would outweigh the mitigating. 
    In such a case, as I understand it, if one juror agrees that the facts exists but the... thinks they have no mitigating significance, that juror can require the others not to consider them, and therefore requires the death penalty be imposed.

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    --If it please the Court, I believe this is not a Lockett problem. 
    Lockett, Eddings, Hitchcock, Skipper, Penry, all deal with exclusion of types of evidence or limitation on the ability to give the proved mitigation full effect. 
    That is not what we have here. 
    We are simply dealing with a vehicle by which this mitigation is proved. 
    We do not in any way in North Carolina limit what the jury can hear, what can be put in beyond the... the wildest realm of just the ordinary evidentiary requirements. 
    The only thing that North Carolina does, and we believe properly does, is we require the defendant to prove his mitigating factors to the satisfaction of the whole jury so that we can have an understanding and a belief that the evidence in mitigation, like the aggravation in aggravation, is reliably proven. 
    And we believe this is different from Lockett. 
    Lockett dealt with a jury not being allowed to hear certain types of evidence or give any consideration to types of evidence.

    Then we go to... then we go to issue 4 of the instructions, and on page 14 of the Joint Appendix, or page 14 and 15 of the Joint Appendix, the jury is told to 
    "unanimously find beyond reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance found by you is or are sufficiently substantial to call for imposition of the death penalty. " 
    And again, they are to look at this in light of the case. 
    They are to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, and they're told an aggravating... circumstance, may exist in a particular case and still not be sufficiently substantial to call for the death penalty. 
    Therefore, it is not enough for the state to prove from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances.

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    --Then... then the jury still must determine in that fourth issue whether the aggravating factors found are sufficiently substantial to warrant imposition of the death penalty, and they are specifically told the mere fact of finding an aggravating factor does not mandate death. 
    They still have to find that death is deserved in this case. 
    And they look at it in light of the case, and not in light of... you know, in any kind of abstract form. 
    They don't just say heinous, atrocious or cruel; that sounds bad to me, therefore death. 
    They are to look at it under the facts of that case and in light of the case. 
    The... as... as I said, the burden of proof that we place upon the defendants to prove their mitigation is not onerous. 
    And it's an easy one, it is one traditionally placed on defendants to prove matters, particularly within their own knowledge. 
    It is suggested that there is a hold-out juror; this has been the hypotheticals. 
    There clearly was no hold-out juror here, since two matters in mitigation were found unanimously. 
    So, the issue of the hold-out juror precluding all mitigation and forcing a death sentence simply does not exist in this case. 
    Further, the... I think what this Court needs to look at is the risk of arbitrary action. 
    And in looking at that, your other cases would suggest that the danger of the hold-out juror is more illusory than real. 
    This Court, in Johnson v. Louisiana and several other cases, have looked to the fact that jurors take the responsibility seriously and deliberate together. 
    There is... so there is no real issue of one not listening to the 12, or we certainly can't assume that on a... on an empty record such as this. 
    Further, through the... through the use of voir dire, cause and preemptories, full instructions on the burdens and how to find the individual factors in mitigation, reminders to the jury to deliberate together, something which was done in this case,--

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    --Well, when I say theoretically, Your Honor, I think that the dynamics of the jury system suggest that that is simply not the way jurors behave, and I believe that this Court has written a series of opinions that say that the jurors are presumed to follow their oaths, and are presumed to act in a responsible manner, Johnson v. Louisiana, and the Oregon case that I can't pronounce the first name of. 
    The... but again, you have so many issues along the way to winnow out those irresponsible jurors. 
    You have the use of wide-ranging voir dire, which was done in this case. 
    All jurors agreed that they could understand and give attention to ideas of... of mental problems. 
    If... you get full instructions on how they are to behave. 
    And indeed, this case, I think, Your Honor, exemplifies the remoteness of the concern you brought out, because here two factors were found. 
    So they were clearly no hold-out jurors. 
    The state has a significant stake in having the type of line-drawing that we have in this case, and one of the things that is important to our system are... and promotes its rationality, is we have a searching proportionality review, and the listing of this mitigating evidence helps us with this proportionality review. 
    Our court looks not only to the aggravating factors found in determining whether this is a proportionate sentence, but they also look to all of the issues found in mitigation. 
    Indeed, this is probably why they started urging us to keep these findings, so that they could look to the cases where life was found, as well as the cases where death was returned, to ensure that this case fell within that core of cases, more appropriately life or more appropriately death. 
    The issue of unanimity is important because burdens on the defendant, as well as on the state, tend to force the jury at both places to follow channeling, follow reliable standards. 
    So that... so that those people who get life, and those people who get death, get that in accordance with rules, as opposed to a free-floating whimsy. 
    The failure to allow the state to allow burdens of proof will... in mitigation as well as aggravation, will really open one end of the sentencing equation to complete open-endedness, complete... complete arbitrary... it... what could be complete arbitrariness. 
    The Eighth Amendment has never said that its goal was the minimum number of death sentences possible, but rather, to the extent we can, the issues that we're trying to deal with by these sentences... by these... these evidentiary rules, are to ensure that one person doesn't get the death penalty on the same basis that another person would, trying to bring rationality into the system. 
    The jury, after hearing an individual's evidence, by having this... this standard, and if we are going to have aggravation found by this standard, the need for symmetry is such that we do need this type of rule, the jury, after hearing an individual's evidence, will have a standard to follow in assessing the evidence's believability. 
    And so while each jury of necessity will hear the different evidence that each defendant presents, the... the uniqueness of his circumstances which he brings forth in... in suggestion of a sentence less than death. 
    Nevertheless, we have in North Carolina, a... a belief and an appreciation that jury to jury, county to county, defendant to defendant, the same standards are being used. 
    This reliability, this rationality in the process, the systemwide rationality is a very important thing to the North Carolina jury system.

    Ms. Joan Herre Byers 
    --That is right. 
    And we... we basically, when we have people weighing and things like that, we want them using the same list, both in aggravation and mitigation. 
    There is no real principled way... the unanimity requirement forces people to gauge the weight and worthiness of this evidence as they go through the deliberative process. 
    We are concerned that telling every juror that they can find what they want will cause us simply to have laundry lists of mitigation, and where it will simply not have so much a jury verdict, and that is after all the sentencer, as a consensus, a... a listing of what everyone thought they believed to be mitigating. 
    The... the jury is the cross-section of the community. 
    They are the community's voice. 
    We believe that what the entire cross section of the community does not believe as mitigating should not be found to be mitigating, because they are, after all, the expression of the community's voice. 
    This Court has said that there is really no one right way to reach a sentencing decision. 
    Spaziano and Pulley, and many other cases, have emphasized that everyone has a different way of doing things. 
    North Carolina's system meets all of the Eighth Amendment concerns. 
    We narrow the class of death-eligible defendants, we allow all mitigating factors to be fully considered, as they are necessarily considered when the... the decision is made whether in fact mitigating factors are found. 
    There is weighing, and even beyond weighing, we go further and require the jury to still determine, even if the aggravating outweigh the mitigating, that it is really sufficiently substantial to warrant imposition in this death... in that particular case. 
    This is more than the Constitution requires. 
    We believe that our system provides a rational basis, a systemwide reliability, and part and parcel of that is our mitigating--

    My... Your Honor, if 11 believe that he was intoxicated and that's important, and only one believes that he is not intoxicated, I think that it is a less reliable and more arbitrary to decide the case as if the defendant were not intoxicated.

 There is another layer of decision.

    Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr. 
    That is true. 
    There is another layer, but it is only a reconsideration of the aggravating circumstances that were found, plus if any mitigating circumstances were found, consideration of those. 
    This Court has never held that because we are very solicitous about the consideration of aggravation, for instance in Sumner and Roberts are two cases that... that occur to me, we have never held that because, no matter how narrowly we... we... we treat aggravation, that that excuses the exclusion of mitigating evidence. 
    That's, I think, the Lockett doctrine which was violated in Mills, Your Honor, and again in this case. 
    Thank you very much, Your Honor.
