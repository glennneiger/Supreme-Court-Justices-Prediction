    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 88-926, North Dakota versus the United States. 
    General Speath, you may proceed.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    Thank you. 
    Chief Justice Rehnquist, members of the Court, and may it please the Court: 
    It is a special privilege for me to be here because it is only two ways shy of the State of North Dakota's hundredth birthday. 
    The question presented in this case is whether the state, in an effort to prevent bootlegging of liquor from military enclaves, may impose a requirement on the suppliers of that liquor to the bases that requires them to put a label on each bottle destined for the military enclave indicating it is to be consumed only on the base.

    Well, if I can confine myself to answer your question, first of all, solely to the record. 
    In North Dakota the state treasury became aware of liquor being shipped off base and used by people off the premises and being distributed to other individuals who are not authorized to have it. 
    In the State of Hawaii one enterprising person managed to get enough liquor off the base to actually supply a complete liquor store within Hawaii. 
    In the State of Washington, enough liquor was shipped to one particular military enclave where, if it were to be consumed on base, each individual would have had to consume five bottles per day, every day of the year. 
    And anyone who has ever been around--

    No, it does not. 
    There is, however, of course, a chronological link because once the labeling requirement went into effect, several suppliers indicated that they would prefer to supply through the regular distribution system. 
    Others said that they would go ahead and supply it anyway, and others said we are going to supply it, but it is going to cost you more.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    That would be certainly more problematical then, because that would be an effort to directly regulate within the military enclave, and prior cases of this Court have not allowed states that kind of discretion. 
    Although this is a special case in the sense that the Twenty-first Amendment interacts in this particular situation. 
    So although the Court hasn't tread on that ground before, it would be a, certainly a more difficult case for me were I to argue that. 
    I brought some labels with me so that the Court could see what they are. 
    These are 16 labels. 
    They are crack-and-peel kind of labels, like bumper stickers. 
    Peel them off and then you affix them to the bottle like that. 
    They cost about three cents or five cents, in that range, to produce. 
    The state generates no revenue from them--

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    Well, that wouldn't help us with respect to identifying liquor that is sold on the base versus liquor that might be brought in from Minnesota. 
    In other words, it is possible, in a border state like North Dakota, that liquor could wind up in the state that was purchased in Minnesota. 
    And while the position you... offer just has some merit, it wouldn't enable us to distinguish liquor brought in from Minnesota or Montana or South Dakota from liquor that was brought off the bases, where tax was not collected. 
    So, I don't think approaching it the reverse way would help us.

    The difficulty we have, though, is one of the two military enclaves we are talking about here is located in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and I am not... I don't know your familiarity with North Dakota geography, but that sits squarely on the border with Minnesota. 
    And we would have liquor in North Dakota from Minnesota, and we'd have lots of it, because of sales or whatever features that may cause people to purchase across the... the border. 
    So there still is a bootlegging problem that is dealt with by using these labels.

    Only the federal tax stamp exists on both North Dakota and Minnesota liquor. 
    And so we do have an identification problem. 
    In any event, if you look at it simply from the standpoint of practicalities, this is probably the least intrusive thing the State of North Dakota could have done to deal with what it perceived to be a major problem.

    General Spaeth, one of the affidavits submitted on behalf of the government indicated that one out-of-state wholesaler said he was going to have to raise his price something like $20 a case if this requirement went into effect. 
    Are there more costs connected with it, the putting on the label, than we might guess, or is this just a rather extravagant estimate, in your view?
speaker="nicholas_spaeth" startTime="503.910" stopTime="515.764">
    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    I think it is a rather extravagant estimate. 
    I mean, the labels themselves only cost a couple of pennies each. 
    And unless their labor costs are enormous, it is hard to believe it would cost that much money to affix these labels.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Let me ask you one more question. 
    The posture of the case is that the district court granted summary judgment for the state; the Eighth Circuit reversed and granted summary judgment for the United States.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    That is right, although both sides stipulated to most of the essential facts in this case. 
    So it... it's really not a case where there is a real quibble over the factual record. 
    It is rather the inferences to be drawn from the factual record.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    --Unless the states got together and agreed on a sample labeling procedure, that is correct. 
    The state doesn't attempt, of course, to regulate sales on the base in any other way. 
    None of this liquor is taxed. 
    The bases operate at different hours than liquor stores within the state, and sell to any classes, individuals, it wants to on the base, and at different ages. 
    You can buy liquor on the Air Force bases in North Dakota when you are 18. 
    You have to wait until you are 21 within the state. 
    The state believed it had the authority to impose this labeling requirement because of its inherent police powers, and also because of its core powers within the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    Indeed we thought in doing this we were doing exactly what this Court suggested that we do in United States v. Mississippi Tax Commission, when the Court alluded to the fact that the states were free, of course, to regulate the shipments of liquor en route to bases in order to prevent diversion. 
    But notwithstanding what we thought to be a fairly innocuous regulation, and our belief that it was firmly rooted in prior cases of this Court, the federal government chose to challenge it. 
    And as the Court has already noted, the Eighth Circuit overturned the regulations on a two to one vote. 
    The court of appeals found the regulation invalid, I believe, because it mischaracterized it. 
    It saw the regulation as a direct effort to regulate sales of liquor on the base, and that is clearly not the case. 
    The regulation only applies to the suppliers. 
    It is really like a host of other state regulations that indirectly affect federal procurement: safety regulations, minimum wage regulations, environmental regulations, even the highway speed limit.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    I don't think that the state could require the federal enclaves to buy it through the distribution system, but I do think the state, if it wanted to, could tax those suppliers before they sell the liquor to the base. 
    Indeed, the court in the United States v. Mississippi said the states could do that, and in the case I just cited to you, United States v. the State of Washington, the Court said you could do that. 
    You could tax contractors or suppliers to the federal government, as long as you don't do it in a discriminatory way.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    --Well, they are in state, though, for the purpose of doing business, in the sense that they are selling to locations within the state. 
    I mean, that, just as Sears and Roebuck is in the state in the sense that it sells within the state. 
    And I don't think it is any different than situations this Court has endorsed in other cases. 
    The court of appeals also thought in this case that there might be federal preemption. 
    It relied on a statute that requires the federal government to purchase liquor from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered, and a regulation that basically parroted the statute. 
    It is difficult for me to see how that could be preemption. 
    First of all, there is no express statement in either the statute or regulation that any state rules or regulations are preempted. 
    Certainly this is not an area where Congress has occupied the field, indeed the Twenty-first Amendment would arguably prevent that. 
    And third, there is no frustration of the federal purchasing objection here.

    Well, one gets the impression, General Spaeth, from reading about what Congress did, that the intent was to require the bases to purchase locally when they are talking about beer and wine, but to allow liquor to come in from out of state as well as locally, and be competitive, when you are talking about hard liquor.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    Yes, Justice Blackmun. 
    I don't think it applies. 
    In Paul we are dealing with a situation where California had a minimum price law with respect to milk. 
    And, obviously, any time you set a minimum that tends to be where the price falls, if you understand the marketing in milk. 
    And that totally frustrated the federal objective of buying from the most competitive source available, because every quart of milk sold in California was priced at exactly the same price. 
    That's not the situation here. 
    We are not attempting to fix the price of liquor that is sold on the base. 
    All we are doing is imposing a requirement that according to the federal government raises its cost of buying.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    That is right, bootlegging of liquor within the state. 
    We think what we did here was probably the least intrusive thing we could have done, and the case is important in North Dakota, and in other states as you might guess from the volume of amicus support for the state. 
    We also felt we did what the Court invited us to do in prior cases dealing with this area. 
    And, if the state can't do this, I am not sure what we can do to prevent bootlegging. 
    And it is for that reason I urge this Court to reverse the court of appeals before, below, and reinstate the regulation--

   Argument of Michael R. Lazerwitz
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1145.666" stopTime="1226.632">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The military's procurement of alcoholic beverages has generated its share of controversy ever since the Congress, in 1802, included one gill, which is four ounces, of rum, whiskey or brandy in a soldier's daily ration. 
    Before this Court today the issue is whether the federal government, consistent with federal law, may remain free to purchase its alcoholic beverages for resale in military base clubs and package stores from the most convenient and inexpensive sources, regardless of whether those sources are located in a base's home state. 
    In our view the states regulations are constitutionally invalid for three principal reasons. 
    First, Congress has made clear in Section 2488 of Title 10 that the military must remain free to buy its alcoholic beverages at the lowest available price, regardless of where the suppliers and/or distillers are located. 
    Here the record shows that North Dakota's regulatory efforts conflict with this federal scheme, actually thwart it, and thus violate the Supremacy Clause. 
    The regulations would in effect require the military to obtain its liquor for its North Dakota facilities from less competitive in-state sources, and on this record, at an increased annual cost of more than $200,000.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1226.632" stopTime="1231.084">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, now... but that is basically an issue of fact, don't you think, Mr. Lazerwitz?
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1231.084" stopTime="1250.311">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    That is clearly an issue of fact, and in this case there was an uncontroverted affidavit from Kim Keltz, that would be found at the Joint Appendix 25 to 28, and she... her affidavit stated that these regulations would in effect require the government to pay more money. 
    And the reason isn't that hard to find. 
    She testified that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1250.311" stopTime="1253.763">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That these regulations would require the government to pay more money?
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1253.763" stopTime="1256.339">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --Yes. 
    And the reason isn't... isn't that difficult.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1256.339" stopTime="1289.327">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But more money than what? 
    But... I don't see how that is dispositive of a basic factual question. 
    If... supposing out-of-state suppliers required to put on this sticker if, what Mr.... General Spaeth, says is true, they cost three cents, they will have to pass that along to the purchasers. 
    But I don't see, so long as the other state shippers are willing to keep shipping to these bases and simply add on the cost of this, I don't see how the government plan for, you know, competitive purchasing, is defeated.
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1289.327" stopTime="1300.150">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Well, Ms. Keltz's affidavit, she testified or explained that five of our prime source suppliers said, in light of these regulations, we are no longer going to sell directly to you.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1300.150" stopTime="1303.039">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Okay, but do we know how many source suppliers you had?
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1303.039" stopTime="1305.241">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    No, we don't. 
    The record doesn't say that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1305.241" stopTime="1310.677">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So that proves five wouldn't do it. 
    If there were 20 suppliers, maybe five not doing it would make no difference.
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1310.677" stopTime="1323.220">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the Court, in the liquor business, with both liquor that is manufactured, distilled, in this country and out of the country, there are exclusive distributors. 
    You can only buy, for example--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1323.220" stopTime="1324.999">

    --The only record support, or the record that bears on this aspect, is in the Kim Keltz affidavit, and that is not contradicted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1334.293" stopTime="1347.724">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And you... but, you're defending a summary judgment on the basis of a statement that five out-of-state suppliers said they would no longer supply. 
    The record doesn't say how many potential out-of-state suppliers there were.
speaker="michael_r_lazerwitz" startTime="1347.724" stopTime="1362.812">
    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    The affidavit further states... no, it doesn't, that is clear. 
    But the affidavit further states that because of these prime source suppliers would no longer sell us liquor, we would have to buy those supplies from the in-state sources, the distributors.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Well, there is a second aspect to this case that's equally important in terms of its constitutional invalidity. 
    And that is, look at the regulations themselves. 
    The state tells you it cannot regulate the military's procurement practices, but that is precisely what it is regulations seek to accomplish. 
    And under the Supremacy Clause, the state is not at liberty to take that step. 
    And the final problem with these regulations is that since the state is otherwise engaging in regulation over the military's procurement practices, the Twenty-first Amendment in those circumstances, doesn't save the state's regulations from constitutional invalidity. 
    At the outset, Justice Scalia mentioned before, well, what can a state do if there is this problem. 
    Seven states in this country actually use the most efficient method, which is a tax stamp system. 
    The state could require all licensed wholesalers in the state to affix tax stamps, which would actually be seals on the bottle, on every bottle of liquor that they sell. 
    The state could then readily determine whether any retailer, or any other person for that matter, were selling untaxed liquor. 
    And in that respect, the states that do that... Minnesota in fact doesn't do that if that is at all relevant, but in that respect there would be no burden on the federal government whatsoever, and how the federal government went about buying its liquor wouldn't affect the efficiency of that system.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --That is true. 
    And there is another aspect to this case. 
    In terms of the diversion of liquor, and the government again, because of the limited record, will assume that there is a problem. 
    And the problem is, as Mr. Spaeth said, bootlegging, the sale... the resale of untaxed liquor. 
    Assuming that's a problem, liquor on military bases, whether it is bought from out-of-state sources or whether bought from licensed wholesalers in the state, will always be cheaper from liquor off the base in North Dakota. 
    And that is not only because of the source, but because liquor sold to the servicemen on the base is not subject to a retail tax. 
    Therefore, under the state's own terms, there is always going to be the potential... potential for diversion, of bootlegging, from the liquor on the base. 
    But what happens here, the state doesn't impose any labeling requirement for liquor sold from the local wholesalers.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Actually, no. 
    In this case we couldn't, because the state regulation, as explained to the distillers, requires them to put the label on before it comes into the state. 
    And that is what scared off the distillers and the suppliers. 
    If in fact the regulation were any liquor... I mean, the problem with the state, the state's difficulty is, if they want us to put the label on once it gets into the state, they can't tell us to do that. 
    And it also won't accomplish what in fact is going on here, which is to change the way the military buys its liquor. 
    And that's... that is our second point. 
    It is not simply the problem with the increased cost. 
    What the state is doing here is the Paul case, is the Leslie Miller case, is the Public Utilities Commission case. 
    It doesn't matter that the regulation by its terms doesn't apply directly to us. 
    In fact, this regulation is even worse than the regulations at issue in those cases because those cases, in Leslie Miller, Paul, and the Public Utilities Commission cases, those were general regulations that applied to anyone, any firm. 
    And there, those firms got caught up in the net because they did business with the government. 
    This regulation, on its face, tells us who it is seeking to regulate. 
    It is seeking to regulate the transaction between the federal government and its suppliers. 
    It is limited just to the people that do business with us. 
    So, a fortiori it is even more suspect in terms of those cases.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    They could not. 
    That is the Mississippi case, the Mississippi cases. 
    And so I disagree with Mr. Spaeth when he suggests that he... they could readily do this another way. 
    If they... if the state wants to increase local tax revenue they cannot do that at the expense of the government's procurement of liquor. 
    That is precisely what this Court held in the two Mississippi tax cases. 
    What... my point at the beginning with the problem, we... this case is not about the United States trying to disable North Dakota or any other state from policing a legitimate problem. 
    But there are ways to do it that have nothing to do with interfering with what states can't do, and that is regulate military procurement. 
    In terms of the dollars, the practical effects are we wouldn't bring lawsuits if the dollars didn't matter. 
    But here the legislative record, and I mentioned before Title... Section 2488, Congress considered all these... this precise matter. 
    Congress has told the military, look, we want you to buy beer and wine for the bases only from in-state. 
    But when it comes to liquor, we want you to buy it from wherever you can get it at the cheapest to save money. 
    And we need the money because Congress doesn't fund what the profits of these sales go for. 
    And it is things like child care centers, libraries, photo labs, bowling alleys, the things on the military bases that are for the servicemen's benefit. 
    And so this is important in that respect. 
    This money is important. 
    Going back to the suggestion that is made in the brief, and it was mentioned here, that perhaps the military can just absorb the cost; we could just raise our prices if it costs us more to buy liquor. 
    In fact, there is a Department of Defense regulation in deference to states and local... and other local liquor sale... entities, we will not sell liquor below 10 percent of the shelf price in any local market. 
    So, the military works with an effective 10 percent profit margin. 
    Obviously we can't sell above the local price, one, because it makes no economic sense and, two, the entity that runs these shops now, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, by regulation, its mission is to provide cheaper goods to servicemen.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    Oh, I don't want to downplay the competitive advantages of military procurement, but I just don't want to leave the Court with the impression that we had a simple option of just raising prices. 
    The fact of the matter is, the military got very smart. 
    It used to buy liquor, a lot of liquor, in-state from the distributors and paid the additional mark up that is the result of the local tax. 
    Well, the military became smarter, and said look, if we can buy this in bulk quantities we are going to save a lot of money, and that is what the military does. 
    And it saves a lot of money. 
    And regulations like this, that effectively take out certain source suppliers of a market, affects us.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    --Well, the example in Hawaii was, I believe it is Hawaii, it is so silly, but the money, the liquor was stolen from the military. 
    I mean, there are instances where people, the truckers, stop off at a highway before getting to the base and sell the liquor. 
    Now that is, we don't like that either. 
    That is something we call in the FBI about. 
    There is no doubt that there is always going to be the chance of someone buying liquor on the base for $9, and it sells in the local store for $11, becoming an enterprising serviceman and sell it to his buddy for $10. 
    That is, that is always going happen. 
    And what we do, and this is what the court of appeals suggested, and I think there is a lot of sense to it, he said instead of litigating these things, and instead of thinking up ways to try to travel through the cases and spend all these years litigating, why don't we just cooperate. 
    And there are ways to cooperate without litigating something like this. 
    And the fact that the military, by its regulations, says look, we will cooperate with state authorities. 
    We don't want bootlegging; it is not in our interest. 
    We... and there are also other things the military can do. 
    If, in fact, someone is known to be a bootlegger... that's sort of an odd word, but his privileges can be lifted. 
    He can certainly be punished by the military if he is a serviceman if he is breaking--

    The only law cited in this case, and it is actually by the amicus briefs, is that provision of the administrative code saying that all liquor imported into the state must be imported through a licensed wholesaler. 
    Now, the state tells us that it is illegal for a serviceman to have untaxed liquor off base.

    The state doesn't require any labeling for those... we do buy, just for the Court's information, in North Dakota we do buy some liquor from in-state sources. 
    We don't buy all of it from our warehouse, it is not all shipped to our warehouse.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    It certainly... anyone who knows the liquor business would know that you would. 
    And I'll... I can explain to the Court... I mean, this is the reason, and Justice Kennedy alluded to it before. 
    The labels, of course, are so innocuous looking and they are so cheap, but it's breaking down the packaging. 
    A lot of liquor comes directly from overseas. 
    It is packaged overseas. 
    If the... if the distiller, it's actually the importer, has to break down the liquor once it comes here... he doesn't care about the labels. 
    It's the labor of doing this, instead of the way he normally does his business is just ship it to whichever state or ever local distributor he is going to. 
    And so I don't think it takes any leap of faith to understand why five of our prime source distributors said we are not going to do business with you any more. 
    And one said well, we'll still do business but we are going to raise our prices. 
    And another curious aspect of the case is we will... the distributors and why they don't file their amicus brief, or why they are not here, we are going to still buy their liquor. 
    We are still going to be buying Johnnie Walker Black from Somerset Importers; we're just not going to be buying it directly from the shop. 
    We're going to be buying it from Somerset Importers outlets in North Dakota. 
    So Somerset Importers says fine with us. 
    And that is the problem, because under federal law the price differential from a distiller to a local importer is uniform.

    Mr. Michael R. Lazerwitz 
    At times I did, but I don't think... the government can stand on its own briefs and its own arguments. 
    Just one final point because the state does rely principally on the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    Again, we have no quarrels with the idea that the state can take all sorts of measures to police trafficking of liquor within their borders. 
    But that is not this case because, even as Mr. Spaeth suggested, what they really concerned is what happens on the base. 
    And that is not something the Twenty-first Amendment gives them the authority to do. 
    Off the base, that's a different matter. 
    But on the base and the federal procurement is something that they can't do, and those are the Mississippi cases. 
    So, no further questions. 
    Thank you.

    I think the Court understands the case, but I thought I would follow up on a couple of points that came up and perhaps the Court is also in doubt about the answer.

    Mr. Nicholas Spaeth 
    The last point I wanted to address, and then if there are any questions I will answer them, is the dispute we are having with the government about whether we could tax or not. 
    And I know the Court doesn't like to listen to quotes, but if you look at your case United States v. Mississippi State Tax Commission, 421 U.S. at 613-614, the Court does say that nothing in the language of the Twenty-first Amendment leads to the extraordinary conclusion that the amendment abolished federal immunity with respect to sales, but it does, certainly does not say anything... excuse me, I am misreading it. 
    There is the ability to tax, and I think, you know, that is clear based on a whole line of cases that this Court has declared. 
    Are there any more questions?
