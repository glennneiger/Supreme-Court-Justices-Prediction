Alabama v. White

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 89-789, Alabama v. Vanessa Rose White. 
    Mr. Marston.

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    At issue in this case is the stopping of a vehicle on a public highway in the middle of the afternoon. 
    Having stopped the respondent's automobile, the officers requested and received permission to search it. 
    And that was given. 
    The consensual search produced controlled substances upon... on the basis of which the respondent was taken into custody. 
    The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama ruled that this was an investigatory stop and that it was illegal, contrary to the Fourth Amendment, because it was allegedly not based on reasonable suspicion. 
    Now, this case is basically a scaled-down version of Illinois v. Gates. 
    The cases are virtually identical except for the scope of the matter, Gates involved a cross-country trip, there and back.

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    Justice Scalia, I... first of all, I would disagree with you. 
    I think the facts in Gates were that... that Mr. Gates... of course, first of all you have the anonymous tip that predicted this. 
    Mr. Gates flew down to Florida. 
    He met an unidentified woman, who turned out to be Mrs. Gates, and they drove back to Illinois. 
    And that's what the officer saw. 
    And that, you know... yes, it's unusual, but there is nothing criminal about it. 
    It could have been the wife was sick. 
    I mean, you know, it's not... there was nothing there that if you take away the anonymous tip that isn't... is even... is indicative of criminal activity at all. 
    And that's true here. 
    If you take away the anonymous tip, you have perfectly normal activity. 
    I mean, that can't be disputed. 
    But I think the facts in Gates come up the same thing. 
    Take away the anonymous tip and you have, perhaps unusual activity, but not anything criminal, not anything suspicious. 
    If... if in Gates you took away the anonymous letter and you... you cite those facts, I don't think any police officer would be justified in taking any action on what they saw. 
    We would point out, of course, both cases involve anonymous tips. 
    Both related to specific persons; both predicted the presence of drugs in an automobile. 
    Now, and Gates--

    But I would suggest that what... what the Court should look for is whether or not enough was identified, enough was verified to say this tipster knew this woman and... or this person... and knew enough in this case to say what her itinerary was that afternoon. 
    Now, the reason for that is... there are many reasons for it, but one is that that... if we had a false tip, that would limit the number of suspects when they go out to investigate who turned a false tip. 
    So... so I would say that... that if enough details are verified to say this tipster knew this person and knew enough about a situation so that we know, yes, this is the person they're talking about.

    Does it make any difference in your view if it's a potentially dangerous crime? 
    For instance, an anonymous tip that somebody in an airport or airplane is carrying a bomb that's going to be detonated. 
    How much is required there? 
    And is more required for a drug stop?

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    Justice O'Connor, I would suggest, as we have in brief, that basically the requirements should be the same except that in the case of a bomb or something you've got exigency. 
    And that justifies excusing the... the verification which is, of course, is wide of this case. 
    But the point is everyone agrees that if these officers had gotten a bomb tip and said, you know, Vanessa... there's a bomb in Vanessa Rose White's car, such and such... everything else... if they had gone right out there and searched the car, that would have been fine. 
    And that... and it would have been, because the exigency would excuse the verification. 
    But normally that would be required. 
    Again, everybody seems to agree on that.

    --Justice White, I don't think anybody would know. 
    That's what the court of criminal appeals said. 
    That this is generally known to the public. 
    But I don't think the public is privy to an ordinary citizen's everyday moving from a house to a hotel. 
    That would have to be someone who knows this person and... and... and there... you know, what that tells us is they know something about this person. 
    And if they have taken the trouble and called the police and said this person is carrying controlled substances, they're running a risk, of course. 
    Anyone... I mean, these people are anonymous, but that's no guarantee the police can't identify them. 
    And they're running a risk of facing criminal charges and civil charges... I mean, ostracized by society and all this.

    No, sir, it's not. 
    This Court... this Court has recognized exigency as justifying excusing a search warrant. 
    Officers go out and under certain circumstances... I mean, you know, they're supposed to always get a search warrant. 
    Certain circumstances the need for a search warrant is excused. 
    Here, you'd have the same thing. 
    Normally, the reasonable thing to do is to check out the tip, see if... if the... there's any basis for believing the tipster, find out if... if this tipster knows something about this person and so on. 
    But you don't have to do that... where doing that might endanger human life and limb. 
    And I don't... no, sir, I don't think that's consistent at all. 
    I would say... and this is consistent... that in both cases the probative value of the tip is the same. 
    The difference is that reasonably you should take greater and more rapid action with regard to something that poses an imminent danger to human life and limb. 
    And it's not unreasonable to require that they verify a tip that involved drugs which do not create a present, now, immediate danger.

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    I know of one case where that was done, and... and it really is not completely logical except that it is traditional and it does look to the legislature as the determiner of the seriousness of the crime. 
    That's a distinction many courts and commentators make between serious crimes and not serious crimes. 
    If you're going to make that distinction, it would make more sense to say that a serious crime is one so defined by the legislature by making it a felony than, you know, just sit up and take a guess and say drugs are not serious and murder is serious and so on.

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    --Well, you get... the problem with it is in the case of an investigative stop, it's got to be specific, and that's what you're going to have problems with there. 
    Now, if it's at a time of day when there's no one else around and there's two people there, yes, sir. 
    That might well be enough to create a reasonable suspicion. 
    If it's at noon and you've got all kinds of people walking around, you're going to get into a lack of specificity. 
    You're not limiting it to one person. 
    You're creating a danger that all... the same danger with a general search warrant or something. 
    The danger that, you know, you're going out and bringing in the whole world. 
    And... and that would be the problem with that type of a situation. 
    But it would have to be investigated. 
    You'd have to look at the situation. 
    I would point out, of course, that in Gates neither... nor here... no one knew who the tipster was or why they should be believed or why they came forward with their information. 
    And... and this case is exactly like Gates in that respect. 
    This case differs from Gates other than in scope only in that in some instances this case is a little more specific. 
    In Gates the... the tipster said that the Gates would be going to Florida, which is a big state. 
    Here, they were going to Doby's Motel. 
    In this case, the tipster said cocaine and here... in Gates, he said drugs.

    Mr. Joseph G. L. Marston, III 
    --Well, it justifies a stop because it creates... it is articulable, objective reasons that this specific person is engaged in criminal activity. 
    Now, as far as your... your basic question... what were they planning to do... this Court in Terry ruled that when an officer has these reasonable articulable suspicions and so on that the officer may stop the person in question. 
    Now, of course, common sense tells us it would be a most remarkable situation where the person made a full confession. 
    Usually what happens in the investigatory stop situation is... and this is really I think the beauty of Terry... is that if it's an innocent person, they do just that. 
    They tell the officer who they are. 
    What are you doing here? 
    Well, I'm looking for my cat or whatever. 
    If it's a if it's a person with something to hide, that commonly they'll do something else. 
    Very commonly they will flee or they will abandon the contraband and that sort of thing. 
    In this case, Ms. White just stopped the car and did what the officers asked. 
    So about all they were left with was to say, may we search your car? 
    And she said yes.

   Argument of David B. Byrne, Jr.
speaker="david_b_byrne_jr" startTime="1582.363" stopTime="1695.370">
    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court: 
    The core issue in this case is to what degree may a police officer rely upon an anonymous tip informing reasonable, articulable suspicion necessary to justify a Terry stop. 
    We respectfully suggest that in the... facts in this case did not rise to that level of articulable suspicion. 
    And the reason is that the reasonable suspicion requires more than minimal corroboration of innocent details. 
    There were at least four spots in this factual scenario where the police officers probably could have gotten that reasonable suspicion but did not for various reasons. 
    A reference to our brief at page 33 and 34, I set forth or seek to set forth 12 deficiencies in this... in these facts that fail to meet the reasonable articulable suspicion required for a Terry-type stop. 
    And in this case we began with the premise that the officers knew nothing about their informant. 
    During the suppression hearing Officer Davis candidly admitted that he had no facts to determine the credibility, the believability, the veracity of his informant. 
    And secondly, he had no facts upon which he, as an officer, could rely upon in determining whether there was a factual basis for his knowledge.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    Because I would have... I would have a suspicion, an articulable suspicion. 
    Well, I think at that point, Your Honor, that you would probably be there because you were both curious as to why the tomatoes were missing and also wanting to find if the culprit might show up that night, but you didn't have the factual basis. 
    In this case, I think the key element that's missing, Judge... Justice... is the fact that we do not have any description as a threshold matter of Vanessa White. 
    If they had given a detailed description or, second, if the officers knew who Vanessa White was... but in this case any lady could have entered that brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken right tail light and that's what they had.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but they... they had someone emerging from 235-C Lynwood Terrace Apartments, and they had it at a certain time of day, which certainly suggests that the informant knew something about the movements of the person.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    --Chief Justice Rehnquist, if you look at the joint appendix at page 16, I think that there is not a suggestion that the person later identified as Vanessa White came from that particular apartment, but rather she would be... the fact the informant gave would be that she would be leaving the area. 
    Now, I think that is substantially different from leaving a particular apartment. 
    In this case, had the informant... or had the officer gotten there and had simply said, let me call the gas company or let me call and see if, during this hour of passage of time, if Vanessa White actually rented 235-C, or if they had determined that in this case the brown Plymouth station wagon was registered to Vanessa White--

    the Alabama Court of Appeals says that Corporal Davis received a phone call from an anonymous person stating that Vanessa White would be leaving 235-C Lynwood Terrace Apartments at a particular time in a brown Plymouth station wagon.

    Well, I think... I think what he's saying there... that exchange that you quoted... I think all he meant to say is that the caller didn't say that 230... whatever the number is... 30... 235-C... was her residence. 
    The question is the caller... so, in effect the information was that she would be leaving her residence at a given time. 
    The caller didn't say she would be leaving her residence. 
    He just said she would be leaving this area. 
    I... I think what was left out is whether that was her residence or not.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    --I think that would be still pretty minimal corroboration, Your Honor, because in this case, absent a specific description, we don't know who was getting into that vehicle. 
    We do not know that it was Vanessa White. 
    We simply know that it was a lady that entered the vehicle. 
    A detailed description... and as Justice White suggested... if we had the kind of description initially given in Draper... now, Draper's facts of course were... were probable cause facts... but I think it's significant also that that was a known informant... in fact, a paid... a paid special employee. 
    But in that case, they described the gentleman who would be leaving the train, Draper, coming back to Denver from Chicago, as being a black male, five, eight, 160, wearing brown pants, black shoes, carrying a tan briefcase. 
    Now, the visual observation then of the officer who saw a person fitting that exact description, coupled with the further detail that that person, Draper, would be moving at a rapid pace, brisk walk. 
    And, indeed, the person fitting that description, with that walk, did get off the train from Chicago in the... the Denver terminal. 
    And under those circumstances... and I will grant to the Justice that that was a probable cause for arrest and search. 
    Because they found, in fact, the contraband on Draper that day. 
    But in this case I think we have to go back to Justice White's opinion in Jernigan v. Louisiana where he dissented from a denial of cert., and as he focuses the critical issue there he asked us and draws our attention to the specificity of the information provided, the independent corroboration by the police. 
    In here the corroboration is extraordinarily minimal. 
    And third, the danger to the public, which gets back to the... to the observation of two of the Justices of the Court. 
    Now, in Gates Justice White was reluctant. 
    And granted, Gates was a case that wanted to foster the warrant process. 
    But at least in that case Gates... Justice White in Gates was reluctant to prove any standard which did not require a showing of the facts from which an inference might be drawn, first, that the informant was credible or believable and, secondly, was that information obtained in a reliable fashion.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    Yes, sir, no question about it. 
    But I differ from my brother in saying that the facts in Gates in my judgment were extraordinarily different. 
    And this is not a mini-Gates factual scenario. 
    The facts in Gates involved the verification by a police officer of eight separate facts dealing from unique travel arrangements, where Sue Gates would drive, Lance Gates would fly. 
    The destination: West Palm Beach, Florida. 
    In fact, within 24 hours of the time predicted, passage is booked. 
    He does... he, Lance Gates, flies to that location. 
    He goes directly to a Holiday Inn where Sue Gates is registered there. 
    The two of them immediately leave, driving by a highway, an arterial highway that is frequently used in going back to Bloomingdale, Illinois and to the Chicago area. 
    The length of time in Florida-- 
    Now, as one of the Justices... and I may be wrong in this, but I believe Justice White said this... this wasn't innocent activity. 
    This was suspicious as the dickens.

    --I'm sorry, sir. 
    But at any rate, I would suggest that this also doesn't reach the stop situation that the Chief Justice's opinion in Sokolow addressed late in 1989 because there, DE agents... DEA agents, excuse me... observed and verified with their own eyes and senses six objective characteristics of a drug courier. 
    And that was the $2,100 in cash from a roll of 20s; they travelled under an assumed name; the destination at Miami was a source city for drugs; they stayed in Miami 48 hours and it takes 20 hours to simply fly there and get on the plane and fly back; apparent nervousness; and he checked none of the luggage. 
    I also would like to digress and go back to Gates because I left out something. 
    When my brother suggests there was totally innocent activity in Gates, let me suggest that suspicion also should have been generated by reason of the fact that Lance Gates was using switched plates on the vehicle that went back to Bloomingdale. 
    It was a plate, albeit registered to him, but it was a plate for a different kind of car... I believe a Hornet automobile, as opposed to the Mercury that he was driving. 
    In total, though, and in sum, I would suggest that... that we've got far more verification, reasonable suspicion, articulable suspicion in Sokolow than are present in these facts.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    I think reasonably articulable suspicion is a standard that is reasonably fixed, but I think reasonable men, dependent upon what the crime is, must react differently. 
    And if we've got the danger to the public as being the third criteria that Justice White suggests, when you get the area of bomb in a possible motel, then whether or not you make a particular criminal case 
    "in a neat, tight package. " 
    or you preserve life, we must, as a society, preserve life.

    Yes, sir. 
    I think... I think that the question there is, of course, they're... they're afraid that if they're... they are disclosed, they may be burned. 
    And I think that's the common parlance. 
    I think... I think, however, that what you're doing is we're trying to balance the right... the right of the citizen as opposed, in this case, to the informant. 
    Let me suggest that both, as an Assistant United States Attorney and as... and as a defense counsel, I've seen numerous requests for disclosure of informants. 
    And it has been my experience, respectfully, that courts and judges do not grant that. 
    And I, at least in my experience, limited though it may be, I have never seen a judge disclose a confidential informant. 
    But that is a very clear danger. 
    And it is any time when police rely upon informant activity.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    I think that is... I think that is clearly... clearly true. 
    But I think that this Court has in Adams v. Williams case at least expressed some concern about anonymity without accountability, because the Chief Justice in answering those questions points out in the four factors that he gives at least twice the fact that the informant was known, had provided information in the past and, most critically, would have been subject to criminal prosecution. 
    I do beg to differ from my co-counsel in that in this case, this informant would not have been subject to criminal prosecution because the officer said he did not know who that person was, and they had not heard from that individual subsequently. 
    And that the informant was not "known" to the Montgomery Police Department. 
    The linchpin of this case is whether or not the Court will approve a stop and a detention of a citizen based upon an information provided by an anonymous tipster who is not held to a standard of accountability and where the corroboration of the details is minimal. 
    In this case, as pointed out by Justice O'Connor, had they allowed the vehicle to get and even turn into the motel, if the officer had approached and said, my name is Patrolman David Byrne, may I see your license, please, ma'am, and that license turned out to be Vanessa White and she had made the turn into the Doby Motel at a minimum, I believe, given all of the facts under these circumstances, you would have had reasonably articulable suspicion. 
    I do not believe that we got to that level.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    Yes, sir, and given... given the opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, they reached and attacked this question only as a stop case, not as an arrest situation. 
    Once we leave the determination of reasonable suspicion to a police officer guided by a concept as amorphous as the totality of the circumstances, we have a very difficult situation because the officer whose responsibility it is to ferret out crime and enforce the law is... is in an very difficult circumstance. 
    And the totality of the circumstance's test, where it's being determined by mutual and detached magistrate, is a far greater guarantor of Fourth Amendment protections than giving the anonymous... excuse me... the totality of the circumstances test to the police officer to determine for himself if his tipster--

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    If I gave... made that suggestion, I was in error, because I'm not. 
    Gates simply dealt with a warrant situation where the totality of the circumstances supplanted or replaced in part Aquilar and Spinelli's two-pronged test. 
    I would suggest that reading the opinions of the Gates' court, however, we did not completely abdicate or banish those considerations as factors among the totality of the circumstances.

    Mr. David B. Byrne, Jr. 
    --Excuse me, but in this case, in Terry, the officer, who was a trained officer for many years of experience, observed suspicious activity independent of whatever she did. 
    And I think that makes a difference, sir, because there it looked as if they were casing the joint for some period of time before they approached Terry and his friends, asked for their names, and they mumbled something, reached for the pocket and the officer put his hand in there. 
    And at that point, of course, this Court upheld Terry. 
    But Terry was defined in the narrowest possible terms by the Chief Justice. 
    Is it always unreasonable? 
    And I would respectfully suggest that we have not moved beyond that narrow framework of Terry by reason of the... the time that has passed. 
    Thank you.
