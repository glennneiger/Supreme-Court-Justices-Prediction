Pennsylvania v. Muniz

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 89-213, Pennsylvania v. Muniz.

    Mr. J. Michael Eakin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In this case we have a drunk driving suspect, Inocencio Muniz, who was legitimately in custody, and that is not at issue. 
    What is at issue is what the police did with Mr. Muniz once they lawfully had him in custody. 
    What they did is what they do with the large majority of drunk driving cases, which now number of 1,000 a year in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. 
    They took him to one of the central booking stations that have been set up and there turned him over to several processing agents, employees of the county whose job it is to do nothing but process drunk driving suspects. 
    What they did was a multi-step function, all of it on videotape. 
    They bring the individual into the room, ask him some routine booking questions, his name, his address, his Social Security number and such. 
    They then follow that with several sobriety tests. 
    They first at this point ask him to try to calculate the date of his sixth birthday. 
    They ask him to walk a line, nine steps. 
    They ask him to balance himself on one leg while counting to 30, and they conduct the horizontal gaze nystagmus test which measures the effect of alcohol on the function of the eye.

    The individual is advised that under Pennsylvania law there is an implied consent. 
    You have the breath test here. 
    If you refuse to take it, you will lose your license for an additional year's time, regardless of the conviction or lack of conviction on the underlying drunk driving case. 
    In this case, Mr. Muniz made several statements while that was being explained to him, as is required by Pennsylvania law. 
    He refused the test eventually. 
    At that point he was taken again to another table. 
    He was given his warnings under the Miranda decision, and then for the first time was asked specific questions aimed at his drinking, where he was drinking, what he had to drink, where he was coming from. 
    The test in this case or the issue that is to be resolved, we submit, is the distinction between those latter questions, which are clearly aimed at gaining testimonial evidence from the accused, and everything that went before, which was gained or aimed at gaining physical evidence, demonstrable evidence.

    Mr. J. Michael Eakin 
    That's correct. 
    It is... the question is not aimed at getting the truthful... what is... how old were you in such and such a year. 
    It's aimed to show that the mind is affected, not the contents of the mind but the brain being affected by alcohol. 
    The brain does a lot of things. 
    It controls your feet when you walk the line. 
    It controls your tongue when you go to talk. 
    That's why slurred speech is one of the classic indicia that... that defense counsel say, well, he didn't have slurred speech when... when the policeman doesn't hear it. 
    It's that classic. 
    But it's because the brain is affected by alcohol, not the tongue itself.

 You... you did have in this case the fact he refused to take the... the one test. 
 You can use the eye movements, and you can use the staggering down the line. 
 Do you really need the rest of the evidence? 
 It seems to me... it almost sounds cumulative to me here that what we're fighting about.

    It may be, Your Honor, but the goal of the testing is to establish a routine that gives the best possible evidence to the finder of fact, and the three standard tests developed by the Highway Safety Council are ones that have statistically been shown to correlate to a very high degree to persons over the legal limit.

    The function affected is the brain. 
    We're not asking him to disclose any information about it. 
    The fact that he is more likely to say something incriminating or not should not inhibit the police in gathering physical evidence, which I suggest this is, just as much as walking the line is.

    Mr. J. Michael Eakin 
    Well, it is different in that sense, I agree, but I would suggest that the mere fact that the test is an oral one rather than a physical one, strictly physical, is not the basis for the Court's distinction between testimonial and demonstrative evidence... it never has been, I'd suggest never should be. 
    The fact that no fact is disclosed here is significant. 
    The purpose for this information is not to show the date of his sixth birthday. 
    The Superior Court in this case felt that the routine questions were certainly all right. 
    We had the right to ask the individual to submit to a routine sobriety test of a physical nature. 
    They said, however, at some point during the latter, Mr. Muniz' responses became communicative in nature and therefore Miranda came in the side door and should have been given to him at the outset. 
    I think the record is clear that these were spontaneous remarks made in response to his instructions. 
    They were honest, they were on videotape, they were not coercive, and the fact that he merely said something in response that is incriminating in itself does not mean that--

    Nor is it reasonably likely to get that. 
    The mere fact that intoxicated people might be more inclined to spill the beans on themselves than a sober person doesn't give them a greater or a different rule.

    Mr. J. Michael Eakin 
    --I think the damage is shown by the Thompson case in Pennsylvania, one of the superior court's line of cases, where they did, in response to the decision in this case, give Miranda warnings at the outset. 
    The accused then became, in the words of the court, obscene and belligerent when he refused to cooperate with these physical tests, because they had just told him he had the right to remain silent and have a lawyer present. 
    And he didn't want to do that without his lawyer present. 
    He became obscene and belligerent and the court ended up suppressing the entire tape.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    A distinction must be drawn in this case because of the crime involved. 
    Driving under the influence is a unique offense in the sense that the state of the mind of the defendant is actually an element of the offense. 
    The Commonwealth must prove for a conviction driving under the influence of alcohol to a degree that makes the person incapable of safe driving. 
    "Under the influence of alcohol" is defined by the Pennsylvania courts as to include any mental or physical condition as a result of drinking that either makes the person unfit to drive or substantially impairs judgment, clearness of intellect or normal faculties essential for safe driving. 
    And Pennsylvania courts have defined "substantial impairment" to be diminution or enfeeblement in ability to exercise judgment, to deliberate or to react prudently to changed circumstances.

    Well, in some circumstances the name and address may not be testimonial. 
    It may be considered... I would submit it would be testimonial because it discloses the contents of the mind. 
    Sometimes it would not be interrogation because it would be found to be incident to normal arrest and custody. 
    However, in the drunk driving situation where practically anything can disclose the contents of the mind and can be expected to produce an incriminating response that... that then even asking the name and address without being... without giving the Miranda warnings would be considered interrogation.

    I think... I think that under some circumstances that could also be testimonial; if, for example, it discloses the man's inability to follow instructions. 
    And one of the key parts of the... of the coordination tests, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration instructions, is one of the key scoring points is can this man follow directions. 
    So that if his walking the straight line, if he can't do that because he can't follow the directions or he can't remember the test, that, yes, that can be testimonial, also.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    Well, not exactly, and it's... it's hard to come up with a precise phrase because the other cases don't deal exactly with this issue. 
    The only issue that I can see close is the insanity situation. 
    Most other cases, how... whether or not I can reason doesn't really come into whether or not the crime can be proven.

speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="1970.254" stopTime="1992.869">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    In those cases, the person who is giving the sample is not trying to communicate anything to the person he's giving the sample to, nor are the... are the law enforcement authorities attempting to get communication. 
    They simply want the physical aspect, the normal sound of the voice, the normal way the handwriting is written so that there's no communication.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    It takes some brain activity. 
    I think in past decisions of this Court, the Court has found it to be so minimal as to be not considered because it's no conscious thought, and there's no... although there's brain activity, there's no intention to communicate.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    That's right, and I do not think that, under my understanding of this Court's past decisions, that that would not be permissible because that discloses rather than you giving me a sentence, 
    "the quick brown fox jumps over the log. " 
    to write, and I write what you tell me to write. 
    If you pick what you write and you decide how to spell it and what you pick, then that does disclose the mental thought process.

    So the handwriting sample cases depend upon whether or not the defendant is told what to write, which is all right, or said write anything you want, which is not all right?

    Except that if he forgets how to write the sentence, he can look on the paper and see it to write it. 
    In fact, there's a case, United States v. Campbell, which is the court of appeals... it's not this circuit... which where the individual had to spell the exemplar, where the exemplar was dictated to them but they had to pick the spelling, that that was found to be testimonial because the person conveyed the contents of his thought process, this is how I spell... how I spell the word. 
    And so similarly, if you are asked to recite the ABCs, again that's not this case, but if you're asked to recite the ABCs and you have to pick what comes after D and how many letters are there, that that discloses exactly what the Fifth Amendment was intended to protect.

 Why is that different from Justice White's example asking him to walk? 
 That tells you how the nervous system functions. 
 It doesn't reveal any of the material that's stored in the warehouse. 
 I think contents of the mind means something's stored there, not how it works.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="2602.912" stopTime="2623.908">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    Because identification is not... the... the physical identification... as Justice Scalia said, the Fifth Amendment... the Fifth Amendment protects the person from being a witness against themselves. 
    Identification doesn't make... doesn't normally make that person a witness against himself.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2623.908" stopTime="2634.783">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but that's because the cases have said identification in this sense is not testimonial. 
    Not that it's not an element of the... not that it's not helpful in getting the person convicted.
speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="2634.783" stopTime="2650.959">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    But... but if you identify me, that doesn't help you to convict me. 
    It helps you to convict me in the sense that you may know who the suspect is. 
    But the police... the law enforcement authorities still must take and develop their evidence on their own and make their case, as opposed to having me participate in making their case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2650.959" stopTime="2669.937">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but if... if we know that a person with a certain kind of handwriting forged this check, and it turns out that you have... required by the grand jury to give a handwriting example, or have that kind of handwriting, that is very obviously a link in the prosecution's case against you.

    It--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2670.206" stopTime="2675.991">

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    --It... it is a link in the case, but... but it's not the case. 
    It... it, again, may provide the identity of the individual. 
    It would have to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2682.097" stopTime="2688.501">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You... you say the difference in it is whether it's just a link in the case as opposed to the case?
speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="2688.501" stopTime="2809.197">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    --Well... and a person's identity is always a link in the case, because even if you have really strong proof, if you don't have the... who the... if you can't prove who it was, you don't have a case. 
    But you don't have... but identity doesn't help prove the elements of the crime. 
    For... for example, this Court, in, I believe, California v. Byers, said that an individual had to stop... had to stop after he had an accident and stay there. 
    And he was... by staying there, he was divulging his identity. 
    But that this... it didn't help the Commonwealth prove their case, because they still had to prove that he had committed some criminal violation. 
    There were other parts to the opinion. 
    I... I agree, but that's my understanding of the difference between identity and... and actually helping convict yourself. 
    The... there can be no question that calculating the sixth birthday or the other things that Mr. Muniz was asked to do, again, show either his ability to recall or reason or his inability to do that, and his clearness of intellect, judgment and mental state. 
    The fact that... that he didn't direct... in other words, that the Commonwealth didn't want to use his... the date of his sixth birthday for the actual proof of when the date of his sixth birthday is, is of no moment, as this Court decided in Estelle v. Smith. 
    The impressions, inferences, from what was said can be... can be just as protected and just as testimonial as... as the direct words. 
    The... it cannot be argued in this case that any of Mr. Muniz' responses were voluntary. 
    The Superior Court found, as a matter of fact, both that the utterances were clearly compelled, and that none of them were voluntary. 
    And furthermore, where a defendant is in custody and he hasn't been given his Miranda warnings, there is a presumption of compulsion.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    --That... that's right, Your Honor. 
    And perhaps I misspoke. 
    There was a finding that his... his comments were not... were prompted. 
    In other words, they were either in response to direct questions or conduct on the part of the booking officer, not so much that they were compelled in that sense. 
    But this Court has in the past held that where a defendant is questioned in custody and without Miranda warnings, that he... that there is that presumption of compulsion. 
    This can... again, these... the... the occurrences in this case can't be argued to be tantamount to merely attendant... normally attendant to arrest and custody, because it goes far beyond what normally happens, and what this Court has found to be attendant to arrest and custody. 
    This is a situation far beyond fingerprinting or photographing or a blood or a breath test. 
    This was an investigative process. 
    The... the booking center process itself is designed to gather evidence. 
    You have a situation where not only is the defendant separated from the public, he's separated from the rest of the police department. 
    Only drunk driving suspects are taken to these booking centers. 
    The defendant is not asked, would you like to take some coordination tests? 
    He has said, now... now, we're going to give you some tests. 
    Would you come over here? 
    There are lines painted on the floor. 
    It is well lit. 
    The videotape and breath machines are in place. 
    He is given these physical sobriety tests as part of the investigation. 
    He's... the petitioner, in their brief, said that, as far as the implied consent law, that that was somehow to be fair to the defendant, to make sure that he understood. 
    But Pennsylvania law currently is that for a valid test or a valid refusal to be admitted into evidence, they don't need to show that the defendant understood what he was told about the implied consent law. 
    Or that his choice in either taking the test or not taking the test was knowing and voluntary. 
    They merely have to show that they told... that it was a legitimate arrest. 
    They asked him to take the test. 
    And that they told him what the consequences would be if he refused.

    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    That... that's correct. 
    Because he was not arrested until he was placed in the police car and... and actually placed under arrest. 
    A case that can be analogized to this case was... was the court of appeals case of United States v. Hinckley. 
    It involved the assassination of... or attempted assassination of President Reagan. 
    Now the FBI took Mr. Hinckley in for about 20 or 25 minutes, asked him questions concerning where his parents lived, his address, did he have girlfriends, where did he work, how far had he gone in school, those sorts of things. 
    It was nothing even as overt as this case, because it didn't have directly to do with the elements of the offense that he was charged with. 
    But the court found that since the agents were aware that there was a likelihood that there would be an insanity defense, the responses were inadmissible, because it was reasonably likely to... or the... the FBI was aware that there questions were reasonably likely to lead to an incriminating response. 
    And that's the... exactly the situation in this case, or it's pretty close. 
    Because you have the officer at roadside who has testified that he observes odor of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, poor coordination, trouble producing license and registration. 
    In fact, he told him to stay at the side of the road until he sobered up. 
    According to the officer, practically every contact at the side of the road produced some sort of an incriminating response. 
    And from that point on, law enforcement certainly should have known that... that whatever they asked Mr. Muniz was likely to illicit an incriminating response. 
    And then, more of the same at the booking center. 
    He... he can't even give them his address. 
    He has to look at his wallet. 
    He gets his age wrong. 
    This is all before the sixth birthday question. 
    Is it reasonably likely to expect that a... that a drunk driving suspect on being asked to perform these field sobriety tests, when he can't do them, will provide some sort of an explanation which will end up being incriminating? 
    If the procedure in this case is not construed by this Court to be interrogation, I would argue that the privilege against self-incrimination would be substantially eroded. 
    You can't expect a defendant who is upset by the arrest itself, without counsel, he does not know of his right not to have the conversation, to make a choice based on the consequences of these seemingly innocent questions and instructions. 
    Because the questions, on their face, to the defendant, are... are statistical, and may be... may seem to him to be to ensure he understood, without being told that he has a right to remain silent, or that whatever he says might be used against him, he has no way to know that he doesn't have to answer and that his responses may be used later at trial to convict him.

    At one point on the video he even said... he was told, well, we'll read you your Miranda warnings later, and he said something to the effect of, 
    "I know you people are pretty fair about it. " 
    I mean, he was relying on them to be fair with him in their investigation. 
    He had no idea that what they were doing was gathering evidence, from what he said, to convict him.

    is an illustration that he thought that something else was going on, other than getting evidence.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, it could just as well have meant he thought the police would not distort the results, they would be even-handed, not that they weren't doing anything to build a case against him.
speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="3241.658" stopTime="3289.306">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    I suppose that's another fair inference. 
    This... if the Court were to sustain the Pennsylvania Superior Court it would not appreciably affect the way these booking procedures are done. 
    The defendant can still be asked his name and his address and any other biographical information that they need, but if they don't read him his rights, they just can't use that part in evidence, and I would argue that as far as whether or not it would make any difference if you did read the man his rights at the beginning, that in fact it would not. 
    It's been my practice in Cumberland County since the time of this decision that now, in fact, they do read him his rights as soon as the man comes to the police station and again, just from my practice, it doesn't make any... hasn't made any difference on whether the people say something or not.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3289.306" stopTime="3299.328">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is Cumberland County just to the west of Dauphin County? 
    You say you practice in Cumberland County, but your office I see is in Harrisburg.
speaker="richard_f_maffett_jr" startTime="3299.328" stopTime="3389.755">
    Mr. Richard F. Maffett, Jr. 
    They're very close. 
    They're within... across the river is Cumberland County from Dauphin. 
    Lastly, the advantage of Miranda has always been its clarity... it's bright line. 
    The police, the prosecutors, the lower courts, know what must be done for questioning and under what circumstances statements are admissible. 
    If you make an exception to the facts for this case, it's going to lead to a lot of litigation. 
    The end result would be an elaborate set of rules and exceptions and distinctions, and nobody... not the police, not the prosecutors, not the courts... are going to know with any certainty as to any particular situation whether or not the interrogation is permissible. 
    If you allow the kind of conduct or questioning or the process that occurred here, you put a premium on the police devising these indirect interrogation methods, these tricky things of the sixth birthday question and other similar indirect questions. 
    Because the... what happened at the booking center is actually... if... it actually incriminated and was just as deadly to Mr. Muniz as if he'd have been asked, "are you drunk", if for all intents and purposes his responses said, "I am drunk". 
    And I would argue that because the utterances disclosed the contents of his mind, his reasoning ability, that they were testimonial and protected by the Fifth Amendment, and since he was subject to interrogation without Miranda warnings, that the audio portion of the videotape was correctly ruled inadmissible. 
    If there are no other questions, I'll sit down.

    Mr. J. Michael Eakin 
    Thank you. 
    May it please the Court: 
    I would suggest that what the Court's being asked to do by Mr. Maffett is to extend Miranda to cover situations of custodial sobriety testing that it's not designed for, and that instead of the contrary, trying to devise a set of rights that an intoxicated suspect will understand that tells him he has a right to remain silent except you've got to do these tests, would be completely unworkable. 
    Because the tests are designed to get physical, demonstrative evidence and that's all they're designed to get, I suggest that the present law covers that and covers it quite clearly, and Miranda warnings should not be extended to apply to this situation. 
    Unless the Court has other questions, I'll forego the rest of my time.
