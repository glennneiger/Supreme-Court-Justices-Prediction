    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear first this morning in Number 89-255, United States against Energy Resources Co.-- 
    Mr. Horowitz.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves two different bankruptcy court disputes that were consolidated on appeal in the First Circuit. 
    They present a single issue: whether the bankruptcy courts erred in ordering the IRS to apply the periodic payments of priority taxes that are required under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan, applying those payments first to satisfy the debtor corporation's trust fund tax liability. 
    That is, the withholding tax liability for which the corporation's responsible officers are separately and personally liable. 
    This order prevents the IRS from applying any of these periodic payments to the corporation's other, nontrust fund tax liabilities, for which there is no other source of collection, until the trust fund liability is completely satisfied. 
    In the absence of this court order, the IRS would apply the periodic payments in the reverse manner, in accordance with its usual practice. 
    As the court of appeals frankly acknowledged--

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --It's not a question of being big hearted, I don't think, Justice Scalia. 
    In a normal commercial setting, when a debtor makes a payment to a creditor and attaches a condition to it, the creditor normally is forced to accept that condition, because if he doesn't do that the debtor can pull back the payment and say look, if you're not going to accept that condition, then I am not going to pay you. 
    Now, the IRS is not quite in the same position, because it has administrative remedies. 
    It can assess the tax and go out and levy on it. 
    But the IRS prefers not to do that. 
    It prefers to get voluntary payments. 
    It saves a lot of costs of collection and what not. 
    So the IRS has a matter of policy of encouraging taxpayers to pay voluntarily, rather than requiring the IRS to go to court or to seize onerous designations of voluntary payments.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Well, in this case these are involuntary payments. 
    Justice Scalia asked me about voluntary payments, I think. 
    I am just answering that. 
    That is true, the taxpayer can then withdraw the payment, and the IRS would then have to go to court to get it. 
    So the situation is similar. 
    The IRS has a little more power. 
    It doesn't have to go to court, excuse me. 
    It can also take administrative action and prefers not to do that. 
    So, as a practical common sense way of administering the tax laws in the same practical common sense way that private debtors and creditors deal with it, the IRS accepts these designations. 
    It seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do, whether it is required to do so by law, by something that is implicit in the Code, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. 
    But it has never really been an issue.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Our position here is that the bankruptcy court had nothing to do with how the IRS was going to allocate payments. 
    There is a payment... the IRS is owed a certain amount of taxes. 
    Under the Bankruptcy Code these taxes are of equal priority. 
    No reason for the bankruptcy court to distinguish between the nontrust fund and the trust fund taxes.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, that's true. 
    Just to finish the point, it's a very sterile inquiry as to whether this is the IRS' policy or not. 
    I mean, we think clearly it is, but if it isn't, if the court somehow takes the view that the IRS is misapplying its own policy and doesn't know what it means by the distinction that it has drawn, then I imagine the IRS will probably clarify that. 
    And I think the real issue here is whether there is some law, either the common law, and we think there is nothing that has been suggested as any common law bar to it, or whether there is something in the bankruptcy court's power that prevents the IRS from applying these payments which it receives, becomes its money on its books, in a way that will preserve its security and its ability to collect.

    The bankruptcy court is required under Section 1129... Section 1129 sets forth a lot of requirements for confirmation of a plan, and the bankruptcy court can only confirm a plan if it meets those requirements. 
    Whether or not the IRS objects, it would object on a ground that one of those provisions of 1129 was not satisfied. 
    So, the bankruptcy court can overrule the IRS' objections if it concludes that the plan satisfies the legal requirements.

    Well, what happened in the Energy Resources case was that the... one of the requirements of Section 1129 is that all of the priority taxes, which includes both components here, have to be paid in full over, within a six-year period.

    And the IRS wrote back and said well, we're not going to do that unless you get a court order.

    Well, that I think is the difference between what everyone agrees is a voluntary payment and what we have here, because under Section 1129 there is no plan, unless the IRS... these payments are made to the IRS. 
    The debtor has no discretion not to make the payments if the IRS says we are not going to designate them the way you want, then it's just too bad for the debtor. 
    He has no choice.

    The IRS, as long as the requirements for payment of taxes that are specified in the statute are satisfied, if the plan complies with that, then the IRS can't object.

    But what's happened here is that the trust funds have completely been dissipated by the officers. 
    There is no way of identifying any trust funds in the estate. 
    And so at this point all you have are tax liabilities. 
    There is no longer any fund to which the IRS can make a claim of its own money. 
    There are just tax liabilities. 
    And Congress has given the same priority to both of these kinds of tax liabilities.

    As the court of appeals said at page 3(a) of its opinion, the only thing that turns on this dispute is who bears the risk that the reorganization will not be fully successful. 
    That is, that all the payments contemplated in the plan will not be made. 
    Is it the IRS and the taxpaying public, or is it the responsible officers of the corporation? 
    The designation provision that the court imposed here works to the advantage of these officers at the expense of the government.

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="817.628" stopTime="843.095">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    The bankruptcy court ordered the IRS to apply the payments that it receives first to all of the trust fund liability of the corporation. 
    And only after the trust fund liability has been completely satisfied, which in turn completely eliminates the separate liability of the officers, because the IRS only collects those liabilities once, only then can the IRS go and apply any of the payments to the nontrust fund liabilities.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="843.095" stopTime="846.214">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But these payments are being made out of the bankruptcy estate, right?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="846.214" stopTime="846.714">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="846.714" stopTime="850.266">

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="850.266" stopTime="872.448">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, the... what the bankruptcy court does is it confirms the plan of reorganization. 
    And then the debtor continues to operate the company within the parameters of the plan. 
    The plan requires that certain payments be made on a schedule to the IRS. 
    So each time a payment is made I don't think the debtor has to go to the court for approval. 
    It has already been set up by the plan, and in fact required by the plan.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No, there are various revenue procedures about how the IRS allocates this money first. 
    Now, the only purpose of the designation is to give an advantage to the responsible officers of the corporation. 
    The idea is so that the partial payments that have been made, if the plan ends up failing and all the payments are not made, will be used so as to minimize those officers' personal liability under Section 6672. 
    It makes no difference to the debtor, and no direct difference to the other creditors, how these payments are designated. 
    The other party that cares about it is the IRS, because what the designation does is it thwarts the government's goal of ensuring collection... of maximizing the collection of all of its taxes.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I don't know. 
    If it's before the confirmation of the plan, then he is not subject to a court order requiring him to make that payment. 
    He is also, I am not sure he would be paying the taxes at that point until a plan had been confirmed, because the other creditors would be negotiating about it. 
    So I am not sure how that would come up. 
    I think the IRS... if it was... if they weren't already in Chapter 11, I think the IRS' view would be that it would, the IRS would have the power to allocate those payments. 
    And if you want to do that as a voluntary payment at that stage, then the IRS would probably say well just wait until the plan is confirmed. 
    But once they... when the debtor goes into Chapter 11 there is an automatic stay that goes into effect invoking the protection of the bankruptcy court holding off all the creditors, holding them at bay with the powers of the court. 
    But at the same time they have to give up certain rights. 
    And one of the rights they are giving up is... they are required to abide by a plan that requires full payment of all these priority taxes. 
    There is no discretion left to the debtor at that point as far as paying the taxes.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I don't think there is a policy, when you have two tax liabilities, that one has to be paid ahead of the other, because dollars are dollars to the IRS. 
    What there is a policy is that officers of the corporation are not supposed to borrow without permission the government's money in order to run the corporation. 
    In order to enforce that policy there is a special provision of the Code, Section 6672, that is supposed to act as a very strong deterrent to having officers do that. 
    And it imposes a personal liability on them.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    If the officers turn over, if they turn over the trust fund to the government they are not on the hook in the first place. 
    But what has happened here is that the officers have ignored their statutory duty. 
    They have taken the money, spent it on the corporate liabilities, there is nothing left, the whole thing has been thrown into bankruptcy. 
    And now the government, having had all this money stolen from it basically, at least wants to be able to allocate the payments so as to protect the public fisc in a way to maximize the government's ability to collect taxes.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I disagree with the premise of your question, Justice O'Connor. 
    The government is never going to be forced... the government's designation is never going to force the debtor into liquidation. 
    It has nothing to do with the debtor. 
    It is no difference to the debtor how the IRS applies these payments. 
    It is no difference to the other creditors. 
    The only thing that the court of appeals seized on here was the notion that the responsible officers would try to negotiate their personal liability away by threatening to do various things to the debtor, maybe to force it into liquidation, if the IRS doesn't... if they are not able to get what is basically a personal accommodation from the IRS in discharging their liability. 
    Now that is not the IRS' fault. 
    That is the responsible officers fault. 
    And I would say a few things about that. 
    One, we really think it is very inappropriate for the bankruptcy court to kind of become an accomplice in this scheme where the responsible officers take the government's money and then threaten the vitality of the reorganization in order to get out from under their liability. 
    Secondly, the idea of Chapter 11 is that there, is to give the corporation a chance to keep going as a going concern. 
    And there is no indication at all anywhere in the Code and the legislative history that Congress thought it was necessary to bribe the officers, to somehow entice the officers into cooperating with this endeavor. 
    They are the officers of the corporation; they are trying to keep their corporation going.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I don't know if the debtor has an action against the officers or not, but the problem with the IRS going after the officers directly is that the officers can string out the litigation for quite a while by posting a bond, litigating it, et cetera, et cetera. 
    It will take a while for the government to collect from the officers. 
    During this time in which they are trying to collect from the officers, the payments out of the organization plan will be being applied to the corporation's liability under provision of the plan and reducing the officers separate liability. 
    So it is not necessarily a useful remedy for the IRS to go after the officers. 
    Second of all, it is completely counterproductive to what the court of appeals thought it was doing, if the IRS is going to run out... is going to be induced by this to run out and go after the officers immediately, that is not going to help the reorganization at all--

 What do you do with Section 1123(b)(5), which says that the plan may include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, there is also... well, we think it is at least somewhat inconsistent with the general idea in Chapter 11, which is specifically embodied, I think, in Section 1123(a)(4), which is that the court is not to distinguish among claims that have the same priorities. 
    So we do think there are some inconsistencies with this title and with, of course, the main provision that requires the IRS to be paid all its priority taxes.

   Argument of Guy B. Moss
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="1607.728" stopTime="1740.013">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Where we seem to disagree is whether the payments made under a confirmed plan are voluntary, and the consequences if they are not. 
    I think if there is one word that is going to become the key to the decision here it will be control. 
    It is not a perfect word, but it is a good word for this case. 
    We suggest that the tax payments under a plan are voluntary because the debtor taxpayer controls the use of the funds. 
    And we say if that is not the conclusion that this Court chooses to reach, then control must be in the bankruptcy court, and as a result the court has the power to designate the allocation of the taxes paid. 
    Let me start with a test that occupied the bulk of Mr. Horowitz's time, and suggest an example that we can discuss. 
    A simple $100,000 tax debt existing on the eve of bankruptcy. 
    Of that, $60,000 constitute so-called trust fund taxes and $40,000 anything else: income, excise, matching FICA, what have you. 
    Now, take the day before the bankruptcy filing. 
    The taxpayer is in hopeless financial trouble, is insolvent. 
    The IRS may have sent out notices, demands, revenue agents, is all over the company. 
    The risk upon default is levy, seizure. 
    And the corporation, a day or two before the bankruptcy sends a check, let's make it a certified teller's check, to the IRS and pays the $60,000 in trust fund taxes, thereby helping the responsible officers. 
    No issue here. 
    IRS says that is fine. 
    And whether or not anyone is blameworthy, whether or not the IRS position is impaired and it is stuck with the nontrust fund taxes, that is fine. 
    It reflects the common law. 
    We don't have a case. 
    Now let's take the case--

speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="1752.873" stopTime="1921.882">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Depending... and not decided yet. 
    I don't think that is relevant to this issue. 
    It may or may not be a preference and usually will not be, because the test for a preference requires that the party receiving it do better than it would upon bankruptcy. 
    And because the taxes are priority, it is relatively rare that the IRS receiving a prepayment sum would be in that position. 
    Usually there are enough free funds to go beyond the priorities, and that is why the usual preference issue concerns payments to unsecured creditors. 
    Now, let's take the situation we have. 
    After the plan is confirmed, and we are in that situation right now with these two cases. 
    The taxpayer is now rehabilitated. 
    The plan has been confirmed by a bankruptcy court. 
    The plan has been found feasible. 
    The flexibility that Congress gave to the debtor to stretch out tax payments over six years from date of assessment has been utilized by the debtor. 
    It won't happen in every case, but it did here. 
    The IRS is owed an undisputed sum. 
    The IRS has not sent out any notices or demands, because it is now passively awaiting the payment of the taxes under the plan. 
    The same risk of default exists as was the case before. 
    And the corporation sends out the same check, although it is not likely it will be certified this time, to the Service and pays the installment that is due under the plan. 
    Now, I suggest there is little if any difference in that scenario from the pre-bankruptcy, except that it is better. 
    And yet under... it is better in the sense that the debtor is more in control of its situation. 
    It has made its peace with its creditors. 
    The plan has been confirmed, et cetera, et cetera. 
    But this time when the IRS gets that check in the mail somebody says wait a minute, it's involuntary. 
    Send it back because our policy, our interpretation of the common law says we don't accept them when a letter accompanies the check, as it did, allocating the payment to the trust fund section of the taxes. 
    So the irony is that at a time the taxpayer has wider latitude than it did before, the government has a harsher position, and this fight ensues.

    I think the irony lies simply in examining the government's response along the continuum of the common law situation, at least as we view it. 
    When things are at their harshest and most out of control there is no issue between the parties, and when things are calmest and most in control and a reorganization has been structured, that probably maximizes the likelihood that the entire creditor body will do better than it did before, we wind up in this controversy.

speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2025.550" stopTime="2316.941">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    I think the best response I can offer to that is the standard phrase it's a country of laws and not men. 
    The Internal Revenue Service is but one creditor. 
    It has an important function for the country, which is to raise revenue. 
    But it doesn't act in a vacuum. 
    And the many, many provisions of Chapter 11 that affect the rights of creditors as they have them pre-bankruptcy suggest that, for the purpose of fostering reorganization, what a particular creditor would like to do in a context of nonbankruptcy it cannot do in a context of bankruptcy, and Congress says that it should not do. 
    I view this case as really an extension of that. 
    Look at the various sections that go to that observation. 
    Preferences. 
    Perfectly lawful payments that are made pre-bankruptcy have to be disgorged for equitable reasons. 
    Rejection of executory contracts, which this Court dealt with in Bildisco. 
    Perfectly lawful contracts that are terminated and made into pre-bankruptcy damage claims. 
    Limitations on the damage claims from contract rejection. 
    Section 502 artificially set limitations that would not exist under state or federal law that applies. 
    Tax claims themselves are not all priorities, even though revenue collection is certainly a policy that we all feel is extremely important. 
    Some taxes are nonpriority, and those nonpriority taxes would be treated the same as all the general unsecured creditors. 
    And in a straight bankruptcy if the assets were not sufficient, those unsecured tax claims, or, I should say those nonpriority tax claims, would not even be paid. 
    Penalties are subordinated under Section 726, IRS penalties. 
    In your Whiting Pools case, under Section 543, seized property might have to be disgorged to assist the reorganization effort. 
    And the very provision that gave rise to this dispute, tax claims may be paid over six years, under Section 1129(a)(9). 
    Now Congress, I think, put that in to facilitate cash flow problems that would face a reorganizing debtor. 
    But when it did so, the IRS was put at the mercy that, at some point as those six years evolved, the debtor might not survive and might not be able to make the payments. 
    In between these two periods that I mentioned, the pre-bankruptcy day before when the check is paid, and the post-bankruptcy day after when the check is paid, let's look at what the government suggests is so important here. 
    Indeed, I think that one might even question how relevant any of it is, because in light of our emphasis upon control, what we think is fairly significant is that on the day that those post-confirmations are being... payments are being made, the debtor has received the benefit of Section 1141, the assets have revested in the debtor, all creditors abound by the plan, and with full control over and custody of the funds, the taxpayer makes the payments. 
    But it is true that the cases have focussed upon, to some measure, what takes place during the course of the Chapter 11. 
    So, notwithstanding my suggestion that it may or may not be terribly relevant, let's look at the arguments. 
    The debtor says... I am sorry, the government says the debtor lacks options. 
    But as, I think, Justice Scalia pointed out, the debtor always lacks options to pay involuntary taxes. 
    That is, taxes are involuntary in that the law says they arise under certain circumstances. 
    But yet the debtor is afforded more options in a Chapter 11 than it had before, because it is given the six-year provision and it is given the hiatus period to work out of its troubles. 
    The government says the tax is a priority.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2316.941" stopTime="2328.664">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But the debtor is somewhat different. 
    There is... if you consider the plan a court order, the debtor is under a court order to pay taxes every so often, is it not?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2328.664" stopTime="2443.790">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    It is not. 
    The government made that argument in its brief, and it made it to suggest that there is some type of judicial activity taking place here that is of the nature of involuntariness, like the court approving a seizure or a levy or something of that. 
    I suggest that when we look at the applicable statute, which I think is Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, the one that sets the standards for when a plan may be confirmed. 
    What that statute says is that the court shall confirm a plan that meets the following requirements. 
    Now there are, I think, 11 requirements. 
    Some are relatively unimportant and some are very important. 
    The two that probably are germane to this case are 1129(a)(9), that says the plan shall provide for full payment of priority taxes, but may do so over the course of six years with interest, and the Section, I think, 1129(a)(11), that says the plan shall be feasible, or the exact language is not likely to... the corporation is not likely to run into the immediate need of bankruptcy relief again. 
    There is no court order in the sense that the court says thou shalt do X, Y or Z. 
    The court says that the standards of 1129 have been met and the plan may be confirmed. 
    And then you go to Section 1141 that says that when a plan has been confirmed, all creditors are bound by it.

    Let's break it down a minute, Mr. Moss. 
    Take, for example, the plans that were confirmed in this case. 
    What specifically did they say with respect to the payment of taxes to the IRS?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2459.299" stopTime="2471.091">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Both plans provided that the priority tax payments would be paid over a period of time with interest. 
    One plan--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Did they say anything about--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Okay, but I'm not mentioning the government's objection right now. 
    Now, is there any penalty or sanction that attaches to the debtor in this case if it fails to make its tax payments, other than simply having an overdue debt?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2498.008" stopTime="2511.518">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    --The penalty that attaches is the penalty that existed before the Chapter 11. 
    The debtor... Section 1141, and this is backing into your question with a statutory observation--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2511.518" stopTime="2515.053">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You've been backing in quite a bit. 
    Let me ask you a more specific question, if I may.
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2515.053" stopTime="2517.172">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    --Okay. 
    The penalty... I am prepared to answer it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2517.172" stopTime="2526.028">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Could the IRS apply to the bankruptcy court for an order requiring the debtor to pay according to the plan?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2526.028" stopTime="2534.549">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    That depends on whether or not the bankruptcy court still has retained jurisdiction over the case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2534.549" stopTime="2536.232">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what is the typical situation?

    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    The answer--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What is the typical situation?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2539.167" stopTime="2542.053">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    --The typical situation, I am not sure there is one.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2542.053" stopTime="2543.488">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what was the situation in these cases?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2543.488" stopTime="2576.709">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    The area of retained jurisdiction is an area that counsel will often focus upon carefully. 
    Sometimes a creditors committee will negotiate. 
    The creditors committee is not a committee that worries about the Service, but it will sometimes negotiate for retained jurisdiction to watch over the plan, and sometimes will not. 
    So in some cases the bankruptcy court loses jurisdiction over the case before these tax payments are completed, and in other cases, depending upon whether the provision is in the plan, the court will keep it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2576.709" stopTime="2591.302">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Now, in those cases where the court has retained jurisdiction, could the IRS go to the court and say there is a payment due here that was not made, you tell the debtor to make it?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2591.302" stopTime="2594.338">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    I believe that that is possible for it to do.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2594.338" stopTime="2600.741">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That would be at least a different situation than the pre-bankruptcy.
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2600.741" stopTime="2609.763">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Well, it may and may not, because I think more typically what the Service would do is invoke its levy and seizure procedures.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2609.763" stopTime="2616.117">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but supposing the Service chooses to do it this way. 
    That would be different from pre-bankruptcy, would it not?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2616.117" stopTime="2625.273">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    But in pre-bankruptcy I see no reason that a, the Internal Revenue Service could not go to a court of competent jurisdiction and ask for the same type of order.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2625.273" stopTime="2630.444">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    To order a taxpayer to pay? 
    What sort of a suit would that be?
speaker="guy_b_moss" startTime="2630.444" stopTime="2755.323">
    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Because money is owed. 
    It would be a collection suit. 
    The IRS is unlikely to do it because its powers are vast, and I think we all know that. 
    So that rather than go to the court like a typical plaintiff, it has the ability more than any other creditor in this country to take unitary action and seize assets after, I believe, assessments are made. 
    It could do that pre-bankruptcy, it could do that post-confirmation. 
    The only time it can't do it is when the debtor is under court control, and that is during the Chapter 11 period, prior to confirmation of the plan. 
    The government also cites that because a claim was filed there is some significance that transfers this from a controlled payment to an uncontrolled payment. 
    As Mr. Horowitz argued common sense, I might also. 
    Firstly, in a Chapter 11, under Section 1111(a), a proof of claim need not even be filed if there is no dispute over the debt. 
    A debtor is obligated to file schedules. 
    They are done under oath, and they state what the indebtedness is to each creditor it has. 
    If the Service looked at those schedules and agreed, its failure to file a proof of claim would not cause it any harm. 
    The claim is deemed proved, allowed, and must be dealt with under the plan. 
    All the proof of claim is is one piece of paper that has a signature and an amount of money on it. 
    It may be important when it is due, but the fact of the matter is it isn't much. 
    And in the--

    In the case of Newport, this was a plan funded by a third party. 
    An entity not before the court ended up with 85 percent of the stock. 
    And there were a variety of tradeoffs that were entered into at the time that the plan was structured. 
    The responsible officers had a wide variety of claims, unsecured and secured, and as part of this array of tradeoffs, they were put into a separate class. 
    They waived the secured claim. 
    They reduced, I believe, the unsecured claim.

    Chapter 11 is an endless process of negotiation, and there are reasons, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, one, why these tradeoffs are requested. 
    One which she noted was that you need an inducement, and it makes sense to have that inducement to the people controlling the corporation not to tank the company. 
    So that in a Chapter 7 the priority taxes will be paid off the top first. 
    And interestingly enough, they run a risk by not doing so and by moving forward with a reorganization plan.

    No, it's... the government took the position that it is immaterial to creditors, and your question, which I would like to answer with that observation, says is it immaterial to the debtor. 
    You have an almost endless variety of things that can occur in a Chapter 11. 
    It doesn't follow. 
    For example, the responsible officers quite often will own the company at the commencement of the case. 
    Not always, because sometimes they are not the equity holders and sometimes they are fired. 
    And certainly, as equity holders, they often will strive to own the company at the end of the case. 
    Now, in doing so, that means that in those types of cases when it is reorganized they are still running it, and they own it. 
    And it would certainly be an odd kettle of fish to find that, after doing that and possibly making financial contributions to the plan, the Service is then pursuing them on the trust fund taxes and possibly levying upon their stock, which is their basis for owning the company.

    I am not asking that they be taken off the hook. 
    The Section 6672 liability remains. 
    Both parties have cited, I think, the same cases in the brief. 
    Ours, if I recall, was Huckabee Auto saying that 6672 is an independent source of collection for the government, and that it is inappropriate, indeed impermissible, for the bankruptcy court to enjoin the Internal Revenue Service from pursuing those responsible officers. 
    The government could have pursued them pre-bankruptcy, during bankruptcy and after bankruptcy, as part of the policy, the federal policy toward tax collection. 
    What's taking place here, I suggest, is a balancing of interests.

    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    Well, it's... I'm sorry, it's a question of my being careful how I interpret your question. 
    At any given moment, to the extent the trust fund taxes are due, they are not taken off the hook. 
    But what is at issue in this case is whether they benefit from a payment that is allocated to the trust fund portion. 
    So, in my hypothetical, if the $60,000 of trust fund taxes out of $100,000 were to be paid over five years, say, then they would benefit as those payments ensue. 
    But they would also be subject to IRS attack also as those payments ensue, because it would probably take two to three years for those trust fund taxes to be paid in full.

 What would happen if the IRS sued them immediately and got all the money from them? 
 What would happen with the money that was supposed to be paid to the government under the plan? 
 Wouldn't that money go to them?

    Mr. Guy B. Moss 
    What... no, I... that has been an interesting debate in a number of law firms. 
    My view of what probably should happen is that from the corporate standpoint the taxes should be viewed as still due. 
    The government should receive those tax payments, which then gives them in effect a double payment. 
    They are not looking for a double payment, but that is the result. 
    And then, upon the existence of a double payment, the responsible officer can sue for a refund, thereby keeping the government paid in full and ultimately leaving the responsible officer in the position of a kind of surety, with the debtor primarily paying and the responsible officer secondarily liable.

    --No, not usually. 
    The guarantor is secondarily liable, and the debtor is forced to meet its primary responsibility. 
    In fact, while it is not the case here, for reasons that are set forth in the Code, in an unsecured, nontax situation, the guarantor, if he paid, would be subrogated to the position of the creditor, and the indebtedness would not go away.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would like to make a couple points. 
    First of all, we completely disagree with the notion that the debtor is not under a court order to make these payments under the plan. 
    If he doesn't pay, then the government can move to dismiss the plan for not... the Chapter 11 proceeding for non-compliance. 
    That is under Section 1112(b)(8) of the Code. 
    And if for some reason the court no longer has retained jurisdiction over the case, the case can be reopened in the event of noncompliance under Section 350 of the Code.
