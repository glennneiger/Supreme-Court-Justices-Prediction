    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    These are two cases which come to the Court in writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    They require us to decide the applicable rate of post-judgment interest and the date from which that interest should be calculated under the federal post-judgment interest statute. 
    In an opinion filed today, we hold that the plain language of the statute requires the rate of post-judgment interest be fixed as of the date of the entry of the judgment. 
    We also hold that post-judgment interest should not be calculated from the date of a damages judgment which was set aside as not supported by the evidence. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals has affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion; Justice White has filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun have joined.
