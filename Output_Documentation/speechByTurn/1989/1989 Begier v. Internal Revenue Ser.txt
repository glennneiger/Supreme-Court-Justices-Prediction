    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now on No. 89-393, Harry P. Begier v. Internal Revenue Service. 
    Mr. Winterhalter.

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Good afternoon. 
    The third case before the Court today involves whether a debtor's pre-bankruptcy payment alone from its general operating account for trust fund tax obligations excludes that property from a bankruptcy estate subject to avoidance as preferential transfers under Section 547. 
    For the reasons which I shall present to this Court, I would respectfully present that such transfers are, in fact, avoidable. 
    The Petitioner in this case is the court-appointed Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee in the matter of American International Airways. 
    The debtor was a commercial airline carrier that provided scheduled passenger and air cargo service throughout the eastern and central United States. 
    As a carrier, the debtor had many employees and was required to pay wages to those employees and was further required to withhold taxes from those employees' wages, was required to withhold individual income taxes, the employer's... the employee's share of Federal Insurance Corporation taxes, and was further required to retain certain excise taxes which it collected from the passengers' tickets. 
    By the first quarter of 1984, the debtor had become... had experienced financial difficulties in the payments of its... of its debt... of its debts. 
    Similar to many companies in this type of situation, the debtor failed to file and pay its tax returns on a timely basis. 
    The debtor funded only net payroll. 
    The IRS imposed extraordinary remedies for the enforcement of the collect... for the enforcement of these taxes. 
    It issued a notice changing the debtor's tax filing requirements from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis. 
    It also required the debtor to make deposits into a certain designated depository. 
    The debtor followed these guidelines and on April 30th transferred two checks to the government, one out of the specially designated account and the second check in the amount of $734,797 from the debtor's general operating account. 
    The debtor and the IRS agreed to specific application of these funds. 
    Two further payments were made out of the general operating account just prior to the bankruptcy. 
    One for $200,000, which was applied to 941 withholding taxes and the second in the amount of $11,636 which was applied to Federal unemployment taxes and also to Form 11 taxes for the year 1982.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    All the payments you've described, Mr. Winterhalter, were within the preferential period?
speaker="paul_j_winterhalter" startTime="171.462" stopTime="233.952">
    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    The debtor's financial difficulties continued, whereby on July 19th, 1984, the debtor filed its petition under Chapter 11. 
    Problems persisted and a trustee was appointed two months later. 
    During the administration of the bankruptcy proceeding, the trustee instituted this instant action, seeking to avoid the three transfers made out of the debtor's general operating account. 
    Following a trial, the bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee was entitled to avoid $700,410. 
    The District Court affirmed. 
    On subsequent appeal to the Third Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the bankruptcy court and district court findings. 
    The Third Circuit, relying principally on the dissenting opinion of the D.C. Circuit in Drabkin v. The District of Columbia, found the ability of the debtor to make the pre-petition payment of withholding taxes regardless of the source of those funds impressed those funds with trust characteristics, removing the property from the debtor's estate.

    What particular funds was the court of appeals talking about?
speaker="paul_j_winterhalter" startTime="238.587" stopTime="249.812">
    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    Your Honor, I'm not certain I understand your question. 
    The funds... the funds which the court of appeals was discussing were the funds that the debtor used to pay the Internal Revenue Service.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Simply money drawn on its general operating account?
speaker="paul_j_winterhalter" startTime="252.414" stopTime="277.481">
    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    That is correct. 
    They were written on a regular check that the... that the debtor would pay any other creditor. 
    It is respectfully presented that the holding of the Third Circuit is incorrect and should be reversed. 
    The circuit's reasoning is wrong on four specific points. 
    First, the court relies on the wrong legislative history to support its contention that Congress intended to preclude the avoidability of tax withholding payments.

    Mr. Winterhalter, let's go back to that second clause of 7501 that Justice O'Connor referred to. 
    The amount of tax so collected or withheld shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the United States. 
    Now, certainly Congress can legislate in a way that says a... a particular fund shall be treated in a particular way even though under the classic law of trusts there might not be any res, can't it?

    They have provided other statutes which expressly empower the government to enforce its collection efforts.

 Mr.... Mr. Winterhalter, it... it seems to me... I don't... I don't understand why you say... why you say that there has to be a res in order for a trust to be created. 
 But if the statute, as the Chief Justice pointed out... if it says it shall be created, the Federal Government can make it happen. 
 I should think that... that the problem here is not whether it's created, but how you identify it, that when the government says in this statute that it will be a special fund in trust, you don't know what the res is.

    We have funds being used which were in the account, but no connection being made between the $200 in your hypothetical and the $700,000 in this hypothetical which would connect the monies collected with the trust being created.

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    I'm... I'm not saying to create the segregation itself or to create the designation it has to be placed in a separate account. 
    Again, many businesses operate under a three bank account system. 
    They have their general operating account which they collect their revenues. 
    They then have their payroll account and they have their tax account. 
    They would collect revenues from the normal operation of their business, place them in their... place them... place those monies into their general operating account. 
    Use the general operating account to pay their normal expenses, which would include their payroll and their wages. 
    And once they provide gross wages into the payroll account, they then, in turn, would transmit the requisite funds to satisfy the withholding tax obligations. 
    Upon doing that, I think the 7501 would come into effect.

 That is, if I tell my nephew I am putting in trust $500 for you and in fact I don't, but several weeks later I set aside the $500 and I say this is the... this is the trust corpus for my nephew, that's effective. 
 So, you can do it later.

    Well, if you're looking for something that meets all the requirements of Bogurt on trusts, I agree that it can't.

    It cannot attach immediately, but I thought you conceded before that... that the res does not have to be in existence at the time.

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    At that time they transfer title. 
    They don't establish the trust. 
    What you are enabling by such a ruling would be for the... for the principals of the corporation to in effect... to in effect avoid 6672, 100 percent penalty liability. 
    You are, in effect, carving out an exception that does not exist in the statute... while it may have existed in the proposed Senate statute, it does not exist in the statute as enacted to allow a debtor corporation to avoid 100 percent penalty payments, to allow the Internal Revenue Service to be preferred over other creditors. 
    This Court stated in United States v. Whiting Pools that the government should be treated no differently. 
    That... it stated in United States v. Slodov that there must be a connection... there must be some nexus when discussing this trust. 
    If the Court finds in favor of the government of today, it would be reversing the principles established by this Court in those two cases. 
    It would be obviating the need for the government to impose any tracing whatsoever. 
    It would just say that the trust arises by operation of law without anything further. 
    The legislative history... the statute itself does not describe either way whether the government can or cannot avoid transfers of property. 
    Several courts have attempted to interpret whether Congress intended when enacting the Bankruptcy Code to permit the government to do just this, whether a bankruptcy trustee can avoid a transfers of the government to a governmental authority if the property was properly withheld. 
    Each of the courts have looked to the statute and said it's not clear and referred to the legislative history. 
    The legislative history was... as this Court has recognized, was a long time in making. 
    The statute involved 10 years of congressional debate.

    This is the Bankruptcy Code you're referring to?

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    That is correct. 
    And this... that is correct. 
    The... when... when the statute was enacted, the House originally proposed House Resolution 8200. 
    The House resolution was approved by the House Judiciary Committee, voted out of committee and a report was filed. 
    The language in the report is the language referred by the Third Circuit in their opinion. 
    The House bill was sent to the House floor, subject to several amendments and passed. 
    It was then sent to the Senate. 
    The Senate at the time was considering their own legislation, Senate Bill 2266. 
    Senate Bill 2266 would have specifically authorized... would have specifically carved out an exception that the government desires today, that preference payments to the government are not avoidable. 
    The Senate Bill was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
    What they did, though, is they took... they tabled the bill, Senate 2266, put their language into House Resolution 8200 and sent it back to the House. 
    Because of the lateness of the term, the two parties... the... the managers, the House leader and the Senate leaders, got together and, in lieu of formal committee, came up with this new statute, came up with a... with a hybrid which imputed parts of the Senate bill and parts of the House bill. 
    This hybrid bill is reflected in the conference committee report, which is also attached to the legislative history. 
    That... that language specifically references the fact that the provision in the Senate bill which allowed the government to have the ability to avoid taxes was specifically excluded. 
    Senator DeConcini's statements stated that Section 547... 547(b)(2) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the House bill and rejects the alternative contained in the Senate amendment relating to the avoidance of preferential transfers, that is, the payment of a tax claim owing to a government unit. 
    What in effect this says is that the... what the Senate proposed and what the government is proposing today was expressly not adopted.

    In Section... but what Congress did do in enacting the Bankruptcy Code in its final text, it provided under Section 106, which is sovereign immunity section, clear language that the government would be subject to the avoidance of preferential transfers. 
    In this case, if the Court adopts the position as espoused by the government, you would in effect be overruling what Congress had expressed in the legislative history.

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    Yes. 
    That is correct. 
    There... there is a difference in those taxes, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    The problem, however, is that there was no express exclusion in the statute for the non-avoidability of even trust fund taxes. 
    And certainly Congress was cognizant of that fact by its... by its protection of those... by the protection of those taxes in both Section 507, which is the priority section, and Section 523, which is the discharge section. 
    What Congress said there is that we want to protect both taxes which were collected and which should have been collected.

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to begin where Mr. Winterhalter left off. 
    In fact, Congress did pass the House version of Section 547, the Preference Bill, H.R. 8200. 
    It rejected the Senate version which would have made all tax payments non-avoidable. 
    It did that to reach corporate income taxes, unemployment taxes. 
    It's plain that taxes held in trust and turned over to the government cannot be a preference. 
    Every court has recognized that. 
    The joint floor statements recognize that. 
    So, the question in this case is whether a trust was created and maybe whether a trust was dissipated. 
    The petitioner has argued that no trust was ever created. 
    He has not contended that one was created and somehow spent and... and rendered unavailable. 
    His argument has been that there was withheld taxes placed in a segregated account. 
    In the first place, it's... it's plain that taxes were withheld. 
    At trial IRS Forms 940 which detail the amounts of withholding were placed into evidence. 
    And it's roughly about $350,000 withheld each month of... of the relevant months in questions. 
    On the question of whether taxes--

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    If... if they have a parallel system, sure. 
    I mean, if... if a trust is created under law, under private instrument, whatever it is, payments of trust funds cannot be preferences because they're not properties of the debtor. 
    That's right. 
    Let me go back to the question you asked about... okay, a trust has been created, but how do we know that the payments are payments of trust fund taxes. 
    Well, we know in this case because of the black letter law that a trustee may designate any funds, its personal funds, its corporate funds, whatever it wants to, as trust funds taxes or... as the trust property. 
    If they wrongfully dissipated the trust, they can restore it with any funds they want. 
    So when they write a check that clears, as in this case, that's sufficient to identify the... the trust. 
    And I think that's what Congress contemplated in the House report which this Court has viewed as authoritative of Congress' intent in 1978. 
    When it said, in the House report... and this is at page 26 of our brief... that the payment of withholding taxes will not be a preference if they have been properly been held for payment, as they will have been if the debtor is able to make the payments. 
    So, we think that Congress thinks that if the debtor is able to make the payments, if the tax withholder can make the payments, the checks clear, that no further connection is required. 
    Now, there may be cases if... where trust fund taxes are not paid over, they file for bankruptcy, when the IRS wants to identify the funds. 
    In that type of case, we would be entitled to use reasonable assumptions. 
    One of the assumptions is that any... any amounts remaining in commingled accounts are the taxes. 
    But here we have more than that. 
    We know that there were amounts remaining.

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Well, that's... that's not what Congress was doing in '34. 
    Until 1934, this liability was just a tax debt and had to be treated as such. 
    And Congress wanted to... to say no, once the withholding has occurred, it's our money. 
    There can be no higher secured interest. 
    You know, if it's... it's secured, creditors can't take the money. 
    It's our money. 
    You can use trust concepts to segregate and collect. 
    I think that's clear.

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Yeah, in '34... it dealt with the excise taxes only and said that... that money was held in trust. 
    It was added... I think it was '39 or '40. 
    Whenever withholding began is when it was... 7501 was amended to apply to withholdings in addition to excise taxes. 
    I think the last sentence of 7501(a) just means that the that the IRS can use the notice and assessment and levy and lien provisions with respect to trust fund obligations if it wants to. 
    And we have to in many cases. 
    So, just to summarize our position, we think a trust is created when there is a withholding, when... when net wages are paid. 
    No segregation is required. 
    We can require it under Section 7512 of the Code if there has been a poor performance by the employer. 
    But we don't have to require a segregated account.

    6672 is the 100 percent penalty provision for every responsible officer, and I think there would be a 100 percent liability there.

    --Right. 
    No, it could apply in this... in this type of case as well. 
    If... if... the IRS policy is to use the 100 percent civil penalty before it would use the criminal penalty. 
    But there are criminal penalties for the failure to turn over the amounts of withholdings to the IRS.

   Rebuttal of Paul J. Winterhalter

    Mr. Paul J. Winterhalter 
    I do, Your Honor. 
    The government suggested that the record before the bankruptcy court reflected that in fact deposits or tax payments were made and referred to Form 940 returns. 
    Form 940 returns would reflect Federal unemployment tax obligations. 
    That is not at issue in this case. 
    What is at issue in this case is 941 taxes which would be reflected on the 941 returns. 
    Government Exhibits Number 11 and Number 12, which were attached to the supplemental brief filed with the Third Circuit, clearly indicated that while the tax liability of the debtor corporation was identified, there were no tax deposits made during this time period. 
    In addition, the record, the joint appendix, which has attached to it a copy of the record, clearly indicates when the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Alan Zlatkin, the Revenue Officer, was being questioned at the trial, he clearly indicated--
