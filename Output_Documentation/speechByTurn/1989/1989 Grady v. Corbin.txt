    We'll hear argument next in No. 89-474, William V. Grady v. Thomas J. Corbin. 
    Mrs. Steller, you may proceed.

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This matter is here on a writ of certiorari issued to the New York State Court of Appeals. 
    And the issue raised is whether, within the constraints of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, a motorist, who causes the death of another person as a result of an automobile collision, may be subject to a prosecution for homicide and/or assault, even though, at the scene of the collision and prior to the death of the motorist he or she... prior to the death of the other person that motorist is charged with driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right, and then subsequent to the death, enters pleas of guilty to those vehicle and traffic violations, and is sentenced. 
    In this case, on October 3rd, 1987 there was an automobile... there were... collision... an automobile driven by the Respondent, Thomas Corbin, was being operated in a westbound direction on Route 55 in the town of LaGrange. 
    It first collided with an eastbound vehicle and struck the rearview mirror... or struck the sideview mirror of that car. 
    It proceeded into the eastbound lane and struck a second vehicle in which Brenda Dirago was the operator and her husband, Daniel Dirago, was the passenger. 
    Respondent Corbin and both Mr. and Mrs. Dirago were taken to the hospital, where at approximately 8:00, Respondent Corbin was arrested for driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right. 
    He was issued traffic tickets for those offenses. 
    He then consented to having blood withdrawn, and blood was withdrawn for the purpose of chemical analysis at approximately 8:25 p.m.-- 
    The defendant was not arraigned that night. 
    He was hospitalized. 
    The tickets which were issued to him, directed to... him to appear in the Town of LaGrange Court, a justice court, on October 29th, a Thursday night. 
    However, the Court did not sit on Thursday nights, it sits on Tuesday night. 
    So the Court sent a letter to the Respondent Corbin directing him to appear on an advanced return date, that date being October 27th. 
    No notice was given to the district attorney of the advanced return date. 
    On the night that the defendant appeared, it was not a night scheduled for the district attorney to be in that courtroom. 
    The defendant appeared with counsel, and entered pleas of guilty to both... both the misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated and the violation of failure to keep right.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What is the jurisdiction of the justice court to which you refer, Mrs. Steller, so far as what kind of crimes can it hear pleas to?
speaker="bridget_r_steller" startTime="188.387" stopTime="203.683">
    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    Chief Justice Rehnquist, it would generally hear misdemeanors and violations. 
    It would have preliminary jurisdiction over felonies, but its jurisdiction would be limited to holding a preliminary hearing, and setting bail on a non-Class A case, which would be a--

    Binding over, in effect?
speaker="bridget_r_steller" startTime="204.833" stopTime="243.491">
    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    I might also add that an assistant district attorney was called to the scene of the accident on the night of October 3rd. 
    He was not there to assess what charges should be brought. 
    There was one purpose for him being called, and that was to prepare a search warrant if one was necessary to obtain blood. 
    When he arrived at the scene, the defendant had already been arrested and charged. 
    He learned that the defendant had consented to having blood withdrawn, and he left. 
    He had no further participation in the investigation that evening. 
    And he did not help draw any charges.

    Well, what about Harris against Oklahoma? 
    Does that have a bearing on this, do you think?
speaker="bridget_r_steller" startTime="493.722" stopTime="564.151">
    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because in Harris there is a footnote that in the state's brief, the state conceded that both felony murder and the underlying robbery were the same. 
    And also, in this Court's opinion in Vitale, this Court recognized... or this Court commented about the... it's cited or it's quoted at page 18 of the petitioner's main brief, 
    "For the purposes of the double jeopardy clause, we do not consider the crime generally described as felony murder as a separate offense distinct from its various elements. " 
    "Rather, we treat a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense and the robbery as a species of lesser included offense. " 
    Here, I don't think you can ever say that driving while intoxicated is a lesser included offense of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or assault because the homicide charges involve a death, the assault charge involves physical injury. 
    Driving while intoxicated involves operation of a motor vehicle that is not is not necessarily involved in a manslaughter or an assault prosecution.

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    No, Your Honor, because I don't believe that we are... this Court has held that we would be collaterally estopped, or that res judicata would apply in this particular case. 
    And I think that in this type of case we are governed by this Court's rulings in Blockburger and Vitale. 
    Also, I think that this Court has recognized that there is a strong public interest in law enforcement and that the people should be given a full and fair opportunity to present their case. 
    And I think that's something that arises with collateral estoppel and res judicata. 
    That doesn't happen here. 
    And I think the legislature of the State of New York has a right when they are enacting a statutory scheme to consider this Court's rulings, such as Blockburger, such as Gavieres, and decide that it is permissible to have vehicle and traffic offenses prosecuted separately because they are not generally lesser included offenses of assault and homicide.

    --I think, Your Honor, this Court's decisions which are cited in our briefs, refer to Blackstone's Commentaries. 
    And I think that traditionally in England you would not be prosecuted for two offenses in the same indictment. 
    And I think you'd seen that in this Court in Thigpen v. Roberts because in Mississippi there was a DWI prosecution and a homicide prosecution. 
    And I believe, during the argument... oral argument it was discussed that traditionally in Mississippi you were not allowed to join offenses.

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    I think that this Court has held previously that it is not... that it is perfectly permissible to use some of the same evidence. 
    I think that that issue was addressed by the court in Vitale, where the Court indicated that it was permissible. 
    In fact, part of Vitale's problem may have been the way it arose in this Court. 
    Vitale came before the Court on a petition for certiorari. 
    This Court granted the writ and remanded to the Supreme Court of Illinois for further proceedings to determine whether it was based on a Federal question... whether their decision was based on a Federal question. 
    The Supreme Court of Illinois then indicated that it was... their decision was based on a federal issue.

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    Your Honor, I believe the majority opinion in dicta says a substantial double jeopardy claim. 
    But substantial should not be equated with dispositive. 
    Because if it was dispositive, then there would have been no need for a majority opinion. 
    And in the briefs in Vitale which were filed with this Court, the state indicated what its evidence was going to be. 
    Also, although the Supreme Court of Illinois had indicated in its opinion that the failing to slow... which was the motor vehicle violation... was a lesser included offense of manslaughter... which is the charge that Respondent Vitale was charged with following his vehicle and traffic trial, during oral argument, Respondent... in this Court... Respondent Vitale's counsel conceded that it was not the lesser included offense. 
    But I think the issue there... and I think we addressed it in our... our brief, if I may refer to it... at page 17, the term "the" in your opinion, immediately preceding the reckless act, implies that you might have been concerned based on the Supreme Court of Illinois's opinion that the prior conviction for failing to slow would always be an element of involuntary manslaughter. 
    Here that's not the case. 
    We are... we clearly have separate offenses with separate elements.

    No, I understand. 
    In this case, as I understand it, we have four different offenses. 
    DWI... I can't remember them... reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and third-degree reckless assault... each of which has an element that none of the others do. 
    So under Blockburger... if I understand... let me be sure I have your position. 
    If the state elected to, it could take them one at a time, prove him guilty of DWI, then try the second case for reckless assault, prove him guilty of that, and prove him guilty of the third one for reckless manslaughter and then go ahead with the fourth trial.

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    Well, Justice Scalia, I think there is an issue here, and that is what was the issue before the jury. 
    And I think you've already decided that. 
    In a case where a person was charged with committing six robberies and there was trial on four of them, and the defense being that only... that the defendant had not participated. 
    I think this Court said that the people could not proceed with that... with that additional robbery prosecution because the jury had necessarily found that the defendant was not the robber. 
    However, that's not the issue here. 
    The issue here, in a... in a potential for four trials, would be, did the defendant... number one, was he intoxicated, number two, did he fail to keep right.

    But assuming... even if you assume that he was not intoxicated, I think that the prosecution could still go forward on the homicide theories because there are other elements here. 
    There is an element of driving his vehicle into the opposite lane of traffic, and there's a substantial overlap of vehicles. 
    And I think it would be up to the jury to consider the other elements of whether the defendant acted recklessly or did he act with criminal negligence, and then, was the death the result of his reckless conduct or his criminal negligence. 
    Similarly with the assault count. 
    It would be did he cause physical injury and was his conduct reckless? 
    This is not a case where--

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I would suggest to you that in the... you have indicated that society has an interest in law enforcement, and in enacting 1800(d) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the New York State legislature had a right to consider how the vehicle and traffic laws were to be enforced and how they would affect society. 
    Now, vehicle and traffic laws can give rise to a variety of minor offenses. 
    Not all of them require intervention of a prosecutor. 
    In fact, the vast majority of New York cases would not require the intervention of a prosecutor. 
    In most cases, the district attorney would not even receive notice of a vehicle and traffic offense. 
    But if the prosecution for a homicide was barred by a prosecution for a vehicle and traffic offense, society would be at a loss because of that, and the defendant would basically be getting a windfall. 
    And I don't believe that that was ever the intention of the double jeopardy clause. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Richard T. Farrell
speaker="richard_t_farrell" startTime="1566.955" stopTime="1689.602">
    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a case of bad draftsmanship. 
    The Fifth Amendment was poorly drafted. 
    It doesn't tell us what the term offense means. 
    As a matter of fact, it even spells it differently than the modern spelling. 
    We find ourselves in this case, once again, after lessons of Blockburger and Vitale; the nonlesson, if you will, of Thigpen v. Roberts; the recessed lesson of Fugate v. New Mexico, addressing before this Court, the question of what the term "same offense" means. 
    If Blockburger is the sole test, I'll sit down. 
    Because I'm through. 
    I lose. 
    Corbin goes to trial. 
    Because the Court of Appeals of the State of New York acknowledged that if the Blockburger test, analytical approach... call it what you will... is the way that one determines what the Fifth Amendment proscribes, then as to the... I keep on losing track of the numbers of these things... three of the counts of the indictment survive a Blockburger-based analysis. 
    In this case if Blockburger is the law, if Blockburger is all that the Fifth Amendment requires, then this case goes back to New York State Court of Appeals on remand and the court of appeals will do that voodoo that they do so well on remand from this court and decide the question on state constitutional law grounds, and they may come to the same result, they may not. 
    The good Lord only knows. 
    I sure don't. 
    But insofar as the historical exegesis that one of Your Honors asked for, there are two things. 
    Deeply rooted in the double jeopardy clause is the ancient... it must be an ancient maxim because it's in Latin 
    "Nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa. " 
    And if it's in Latin, then it's got to be old.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1689.602" stopTime="1696.006">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, it may be Latin and old, but how do we know it's deeply rooted in the double jeopardy clause?
speaker="richard_t_farrell" startTime="1696.006" stopTime="1827.743">
    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    Well, Your Honor, I'm going to have to take the word of the historical exegesis done on several occasions by this Court and by some of the law review writers that track the idea of a proscription against double jeopardy, as we call it now, back to at least Demosthenes' times, about the three centuries before the common era. 
    And flowing from that and taking the well-known classical rootings of many of our Founding Fathers that they... we can assume that they were familiar with these deep historic roots, one could probably, even if you wanted to push it further, run the whole idea back into Scripture. 
    When Daniel was released from the lions' den, the lions were not given a second chance at Daniel. 
    Thomas Corbin went into the lions' den, and now the lions say we want to get another chance at him. 
    These lions of the District Attorney's office in Dutchess County, taking an... a fatal accident that occurred on October 3rd of 1987... one of these lions, on October 14th, 1987 sent off to the defendant, Thomas Corbin, the document that appears on page 5 of the joint appendix, a document that was issued out the Office of the District Attorney in Dutchess County, signed on behalf of Mr. Grady, the Dutchess County District Attorney, by one of his assistant DAs, a Mark Glick, 
    "please take notice that pursuant to Section 3030 of the Criminal Procedure Law that people indicate their readiness for trial in the above-captioned case. " 
    The above-captioned case, on October 14, 1987 was the People against Thomas Corbin for driving while intoxicated as a so-called common law count under the VTL, and the People against Thomas Corbin for failing to keep right under another provision of the VTL. 
    These are the two tickets he was issued.

speaker="richard_t_farrell" startTime="1848.240" stopTime="2317.677">
    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Thank you for your correction. 
    Your Honor, the district attorney's office was aware, through the agent that was on the scene of the accident, that this accident had caused a death. 
    It knew through its agent on the scene at the time... at the time... that there had been a fatality. 
    Their office proceeded in one direction, and that was to prepare the case for presentation to a grand jury. 
    But incident to that... incident to that... they indicated quite early on, within two weeks after the fatality, that they were prepared to prosecute on the tickets. 
    Defense counsel appeared before the LaGrange Town Court on a date set by the court, set by the court, and entered a plea of guilty to driving while intoxicated. 
    The town justice, not wanting to enter or make any sentence on that date, adjourned the case to a night when the district attorney's office was scheduled to have one of its representatives present. 
    One of its representatives, Assistant District Attorney Sauter, showed up on the night set by the court for sentencing, unarmed with any information about case except what she could find in the court file, and in the court file all that was there were these two tickets. 
    Justice Caplicki imposed sentence, a $350 fine, suspension of license, driving school. 
    And six weeks later... six weeks later... the district attorney's office, or more precisely, the grand jury in Dutchess County, returned the indictment that gave rise to the initiation of the proceedings in this case, where the counts in the indictment were challenged both on state law grounds and under the double jeopardy clause of the state and Federal constitutions. 
    The county court judge rejected the motion on the ground that somehow the defendant was guilty of procuring his own conviction, repelled division the second departments, Appellate Supreme Court of the State of New York, and proceeding in the nature of prohibition, dismissed, without any comment, and the case went to the New York State Court of Appeals. 
    And then the New York State Court of Appeals, writing for a four-judge majority, Mr. Justice Titone held that although certain... the first... the manslaughter vehicular homicide or the vehicular assault charges in the indictment survived, a Blockburger-based analysis taking hold of the language in this Court's opinion in the Vitale case, the majority's observation that if the same evidence were to be used to support the prosecution on the homicide charges, there would be a substantial constitutional question. 
    And seizing upon also, the language in the... excuse me... dissenting opinion, that to quibble with the characterization of the substantiality of the constitutional question, would rather simply be dispositive of the constitutional question held that Blockburger notwithstanding the prosecution in this case is barred under the double jeopardy clause as read by the court of appeals through its perception of the view of this Court as barring further prosecution. 
    And it is on that holding that we come to this Court. 
    It seems that of the protections of the Fifth Amendment this particular aspect... as I have mentioned... perhaps over-enthusiastically, and I apologize for that... this problem... this specific problem emerges in Vitale and has progressed through Thigpen where the Fifth Circuit in the Thigpen case in the decision below mounted the sort of analysis that we suggest ought be followed, that was followed by the New York State Court of Appeals, that was followed even more recently in a case we cite somewhat frequently in the brief, Connecticut decision of State v. Lonergan, to first parse the statutes themselves as written, the two statutes that are said to create the double jeopardy problem. 
    If the two statutes do not survive a Blockburger-based analysis there, the double jeopardy inquiry ends, and the double jeopardy clause precludes prosecution... a second prosecution. 
    The prosecutor, and I suspect, any prosecutor... certainly if I were a prosecutor... would look to have the inquiry end right there. 
    And if that's where the inquiry ends, then that's where the inquiry ends. 
    But it seems, from Vitale, and maybe perhaps by precursor language in the Brown case a few years before Vitale, that Blockburger is not the answer. 
    Blockburger is an answer, an answer. 
    The answer as to what the simple language, the simple, but as events since the adoption of the amendment indicates, complex problems presented by the double jeopardy clause lies in looking beyond the definitions, looking to the underlying idea, as this Court has said back in 1957 in the oft-quoted language of Green v. the United States, looking to the deeply ingrained idea that the state with all its power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual. 
    Even earlier... I take that back... at approximately the same time that that statement was made by this Court in its opinion in Green v. the United States and a case decided a few years earlier, Brock v. North Carolina, writing at a time before the incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment of the Fifth Amendment into the jurisprudence of the states, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his concurring opinion said that in a due process analysis... in a due process analysis... fairness indicates that a prosecutor who has been incompetent or casual or even ineffective shouldn't be given an opportunity to see if he or she cannot do better a second time. 
    It is the second time aspect that raises the question of whether there isn't even a third level beyond which the prosecution must pass before the prosecution is allowed the proceed to try the defendant again on a second charge where the factual matrix that gives rise to the second charge is sensibly indistinguishable from the first prosecution.

    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    --Mr. Justice Scalia, doing better does not necessarily mean trying to win again. 
    But doing better can also, and as it does mean very often the civil context of res judicata cases, trying to get a better result, to enhance the outcome of the first case. 
    Trying to do better in the kind of callous calculus of the criminal law, a... oh, good heavens... a conviction for a, let's say, second-degree crime could be considered not doing as well from the prosecutor's point of view as getting a conviction for the higher, the first degree, of that. 
    And I think the language bears the fair construction that an attempt to do better is not only to try to convict the defendant who has once been acquitted, but to perhaps try to do better by convicting a defendant who's been once acquitted on a charge that arises out of the same operable set of facts, by convicting him over yet a higher degree of crime.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Farrell, what if the death here had occurred several months after the... after the accident so that at the time your client was prosecuted for the misdemeanor charges in the justice court there had been no death?

    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    It's... it's quite clear, Your Honor, in the cases both of the state and in this Court, that if the prosecutor does not have available all of the information needed to mount the particular prosecution under attack, then the double jeopardy clause allows a prosecution as... as I understand your hypothetical, the so-called later-death cases.

    Now, how... how... how does that fit in under your version of the... the same-evidence test?
speaker="richard_t_farrell" startTime="2456.918" stopTime="2533.853">
    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    The same-evidence test, as we would envision it being applied in this case, would be to take a look at the situation as the prosecutor knows it at the time that first guilt-imposing proceeding is ready to go to adjudication. 
    And if we were to take that in this case, and look at what the prosecution knew... knew... when the defendant went before the court, the prosecution knew that it had evidence of intoxication. 
    It knew that it had evidence of death. 
    It knew that it had at least a pretty good reason to consider presenting this case to the grand jury. 
    Because we are told by the prosecutor, Your... Mr. Chief Justice... that while these matters were percolating through the justice's court, the district attorney's office wasn't completely asleep in this case. 
    They had retained an accident reconstructionist. 
    They were having analyses done on the blood. 
    They had impounded the cars that were involved in the accident.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Under your theory, I take it, if the state were to have come several months later on evidence of intoxication which it didn't have at first, then there would be an exception for that too just like there would be for a later death?

    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    That one, Your Honor, I think I would have to say they had the information at the time. 
    They had it. 
    They had it, or they had it or they had it readily available. 
    In the after-occurring death cases, the prosecution may have... and certainly no prosecutor's going to be sitting around saying, gee, I hope this victim dies so I can prosecute this guy for manslaughter. 
    That's... that's horrible. 
    But if this is what eventuates, if the prosecution moves ahead and moves ahead speedily and moves ahead intelligently and gets the conviction for what is... move it up from driving while intoxicated, let's move it up to a high-level felony assault... and then the victim dies, it's quite clear under the law of practically every state that I can confess to even some nodding acquaintance with... it's quite clear within the context of the cases decided by this Court that in the situation where the death of the victim whose injuries were the subject of an original criminal prosecution, the death occurs after... after conviction of the assault-level charges, there's no problem. 
    There's no double jeopardy consequences, if for no other reason, there is no possibility of ever being put in jeopardy for that particular crime at the time of the original proceedings. 
    That crime had one regrettable element that could not have been... could not have been asserted in the original proceeding. 
    In this unhappy case, all the information that was needed was there or readily obtainable and sitting there ticking away in the criminal procedure law of the State of New York is CPL 170.20. 
    CPL 170.20 gives the district attorney's office, so positioned as the District Attorney's Office in Dutchess County found itself with this case, the absolute right to go into a court like the LaGrange Town Court, move for an adjournment on the ground that there is an intention to submit the case for indictment. 
    And the statute quite clearly says that the judge, Justice Caplicki, in this case, must grant... must grant--

    Well, let me ask you another question. 
    Supposing you're in a jurisdiction where the state was not obligated to or didn't in fact submit a bill of particulars. 
    How would you handle your same evidence test on a double jeopardy argument if... if the state indicts on the... on the greater offense?

    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    --If we were to replicate this case in Illinois... in Illinois, where apparently this is not necessary because that is how Illinois v. Vitale got here... if we were to replicate this case, like your hypothetical case, Mr. Chief Justice, who are in Illinois, I would suggest that the approach taken in Vitale might have to be re-examined and to look at... and look for... look for... for this Court to look for in the proceedings in the lower courts the motion to dismiss, let us say, the second indictment, any hearings that are held on that second indictment... to look for the defense... the defense... to establish beyond at least any reasonable question... not beyond a reasonable doubt... but to establish clearly that the prosecution can move ahead only on the same evidence.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2776.911" stopTime="2783.398">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2795.872" stopTime="2805.930">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, they... they could certainly give you testimony as to what happened, but I would think there would be no guarantee that the state would necessarily use all the testimony of the investigating officers.
speaker="richard_t_farrell" startTime="2805.930" stopTime="2946.254">
    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    But in a very simple, straightforward... on terms of the factual context... situation like the one presenting us in this case... I think the simple... I think that the defendant could probably meet my rather favorable standard in the course of the defense by demonstrating the reasonableness... the reasonableness... of the assertion that there is no rational conclusion to be reached except that the same evidence that the same evidence that has already convicted me will be part, parcel, if not all of the essential meat and potatoes of the prosecution's case against me on this second go-round. 
    I'm quite mystified that the Illinois Criminal Procedure Law is equivalent... doesn't permit the kind of liberal disclosure in advance of trial that is permitted under, as I understand, in the Federal rules of criminal procedure. 
    It certainly is required or permitted under Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law in New York. 
    There might be a little preliminary digging that might have to be done by the defendant to make out the same evidence argument, but I don't think it is that terribly difficult a problem for... it would not be a terribly difficult burden to impose upon defendants to bear the... if not the onus probandi, at least the burden of persuasion that the same evidence will be used in the second prosecution. 
    And then... and then... and then we have set the stage for the preliminary attack on the second trial which this Court has since Abne has indicated that it is the only successful or satisfactory way of resolving the problem confronting a defendant under the double jeopardy clause. 
    And that is it's all very well and good to say that it was a double jeopardy clause, but if you want to establish the double jeopardy argument the defendant has to undergo the travail, run the gauntlet, if you will, to borrow off the language of this Court, of the second trial to make out his or her double jeopardy argument, the double jeopardy clause becomes a rather unhelpful piece of the Bill of Rights as to--

    It's been rejected several times.

    Mr. Richard T. Farrell 
    No, sir, and it has been pointed out that the Court's declination to adopt that test has been characterized in one of this Court's writings as a steadfast refusal to adopt it. 
    But I would like to take the time that's available to me in the argument to suggest that perhaps the steadfastness of that refusal might warrant some reexamination in this case adding a couple of... a couple of additional observations to what has probably been said better, and said, perhaps, more often, and perhaps more articulately than I can say it. 
    But there is, underlying this whole double jeopardy problem a consideration of the fairness to the defendant, who is facing the somewhat awesome power of the court. 
    And it would seem if one were to take general approach of a state statute like CPL Article 40 which says if you've got the material, put it all in one indictment and prosecute. 
    Like the suggestions made in the model penal code that are cited in our brief in opposition to the petition of certiorari, like the cites in the American Bar Association... I think Project for Minimum Standards of Criminal Justice... that where there is, as we also say in the brief in the civil case, the reasonable expectation... the reasonable expectation that... by the bench and by the bar that these claims would all be asserted in a single vehicle, then that reasonable expectation is part of the reasonableness that is inherent in the term fairness. 
    And the fairness that is inherent in the system is translated in this context into a... an adoption of principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, borrowed quite clearly and liberally from the civil side into this specific problem presented by cases like this.

   Rebuttal of Bridget R. Steller
speaker="bridget_r_steller" startTime="3179.890" stopTime="3257.325">
    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Mr. Farrell has discussed the issue with fairness to the defendant. 
    In this case the defendant was on noticed by virtue of Section 1800(d) that he could be prosecuted for the assault and homicide in spite of his guilty pleas to the vehicle and traffic offenses. 
    And this is a scheme which must be viewed as also fair to society. 
    In fact, here, prior to sentencing, the defendant knew that the prosecution intended to present this case to a grand jury. 
    This is the defense counsel, who may well have been the only person in the room who knew about it, but he knew about it. 
    The judge and the prosecutor who was present did not. 
    Mr. Farrell has also indicated that this case should be governed by New York State Criminal Procedure Law Section 170.20 which provides that the district attorney may stop any justice court proceeding. 
    That is a general provision of the criminal procedure law of New York. 
    The vehicle and traffic provision is a much more specific one. 
    The criminal procedure law presumes that the district attorney will know about a case. 
    The vehicle law recognizes that vehicle and traffic is slightly differently, and that because--

    Ms. Bridget R. Steller 
    I think that this Court in deciding this case has to craft a rule which will be fairly simple and can be applied in all 50 states. 
    And I think that there are many cases, not just in New York, but also in... I... I think Connecticut is specific to this... that it's possible in a vehicle and traffic charge for the district attorney to have no notice and to have somebody plead guilty by mail. 
    Similarly, I believe, New Jersey can do this. 
    But here, if you look at it, the district attorney had no notice that this case was on the calendar in LaGrange on October 27th. 
    That is the day the plea was entered. 
    And without notice of the date of the appearance that the defendant was supposed to be in court, there would have been no requirement that the district attorney present--

    --Your Honor, on the morning of October 4th... this is referred to in the district attorney's answer in the county court to the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. 
    There was a blizzard. 
    There's a state of emergency here. 
    And I don't think you can presume that anybody in Dutchess County read the newspaper, just as I don't think that anyone on this Court can presume that somebody in Charleston read the newspaper the morning after Hugo struck.
