    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first in No. 89-530, the Portland Golf Club v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 
    Mr. Henzke.
speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="13.824" stopTime="195.577">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    The issue in this case involves the deductibility of the unrelated non-member business expenses of an exempt social club. 
    Specifically, whether the government is correct that there is a per se rule requiring an exempt social club to intend to report a tax profit on its tax return in order to deduct a loss on such business. 
    Here, Petitioner is a tax-exempt social club. 
    It is a golf club. 
    It has operated one of the finest golf courses in Oregon for the past 75 years. 
    In addition to its golf course, it operates a food and beverage business for members and also for non-members whose private parties are sponsored by members. 
    Virtually all the private party business is categorized as an unrelated business by Section 512(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    In the years at issue, this food and beverage unrelated business produced tax losses when... when computed according to a method stipulated by the government to be reasonable. 
    These losses were used to offset other unrelated business income... unrelated business income from another activity, the investment income. 
    The government disallowed the deduction which produced the losses on the basis that the food and beverage unrelated activity was not entered into with an intent to earn a profit. 
    We contend that no profit motive is required because the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms in Section 512(a)(3) do not require a profit motive. 
    The resolution of this case, in our view, depends completely on the terms of Section 512(a)(3). 
    Accordingly, I would like to take a few minutes to analyze the operation of this statute. 
    Section 512(a)(3) of the Code divides the activities of a social club into two parts, and for our convenience today I would like to call these parts categories or baskets. 
    Section 512(a)(3) creates two categories for the activities of an exemption... social club called the Exempt Category and the Unrelated Business Category. 
    Section 512(a)(3) then defines which club activities are to go into each category. 
    Section 512(a)(3)(b) narrowly defines the exempt category to consist of those activities which are member-paid social or recreational goods or services. 
    Goods or services that the members pay for; that's the exempt category. 
    On the other hand, Section 512(a)(3)(a) provides that all the remaining activities--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Oh, I've got the wrong case.
speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="221.995" stopTime="340.222">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    As I was saying, Section 512(a)(3)(a) defines all the remaining activities, all the activities except the exempt category, as fitting into the unrelated business category. 
    The tax treatment of the income and deductions of an activity is determined by which category Section 512(a)(3) assigns that particular category. 
    The income of an exempt category is exempt, and the deductions... and the expenses are not deductible. 
    The income of the unrelated business activity is taxable and the deduction... and the expenses are deductible if those expenses are of the type allowed to a business by Chapter 1 of the Code. 
    Now, the government maintains that after Section 512(a)(3) assigned Petitioner's unrelated food and beverage business to the unrelated business category it must then meet a profit motive test under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    However, the profit motive test is generally a precondition to the existence of a business. 
    The existence of a business is a requirement for Section 162 to apply. 
    In this respect, the profit motive test is similar with respect to Section 162 as the rules of Section 512(a)(3) are with respect to that statute, where the rules of Section 512(a)(3) establish the preconditions for determining whether an activity is an unrelated business. 
    Once the Section 512(a)(3) precondition for an unrelated business are met, it would be contradictory to attempt to apply the profit motive precondition for a Section 162 business. 
    The government's interpretation--

speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="357.183" stopTime="440.003">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    --Well, profit motive is simply irrelevant for a... to determine whether an activity goes on the unrelated business side... category under Section 512(a)(3) because Section 512(a)(3) does not contain any profit motive requirement and it sets forth specifically what the requirements are for being an unrelated business under Section 512(a)(3). 
    And since there is no profit motive requirement in Section 512(a)(3) of the Code, then profit motive is really basically irrelevant. 
    Now, you could have a situation where if the club was, for example, providing food and beverages to non-members who were, for example, maybe their friends and they were providing them, say, at half cost, that in actuality what they're doing is they're really having the members pay part of the cost for these nominally non-member functions. 
    So it may be then what would nominally be an unrelated business under Section 512(a)(3)... in other words, you would say, first of all, if you looked at it, well, this looks like a non-member function. 
    It's really a member function. 
    But once you determine that it is a... an unrelated business activity, then it does not need a profit motive.

    But the profit motive test is a precondition to determine if a Section 162 business exists. 
    Now, once you have a Section 162 business, then there are other requirements of Section 162 which you... which you must apply. 
    For example, the necessary test or the ordinary test. 
    For example, if you have a business, it doesn't mean every single deduction is going to be deductible. 
    A particular expense may be a non-ordinary expenses, that is, a capital item. 
    So it would not be deductible.

    For example, if you have a capital expenditure, it... then it's non-deductible because it does not meet the ordinary test of Section 162. 
    Or you may have, for example, a lavish expense which then does not meet the necessary test of Section 162.

    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    And... and the government, I think, would contend that the deductions that make up that loss... because it is a loss... become non-deductible because it's not for profit. 
    And our contention is, no, they... they're business because Section 512(a)(3) says these are business activities. 
    And you can't... after you make that determination under Section 512(a)(3) you then can't go to Section 162 and say, well, let's see what preconditions are necessary to see what a business... whether a business exists under Section 162. 
    In our view, the government is confusing the precondition for Section 162, namely, the profit motive, with the requirements of Section 162, which are the ordinary, the necessary, the paid or incurred and other requirements in the statute.

    Yes, we would have to pay taxes because that is an absolute rule of Section 512(a)(3), that you have to... it's taxable income; you have to pay tax on it. 
    Maybe an illustration would help clear up this difference between the preconditions of Section 162 and the requirements of Section 162. 
    The preconditions aren't incorporated into Section 512(a)(3); the requirements are. 
    In our view, under the... what the government is doing, it's applying the profit motive test to the items of expense that are in the unrelated business activity on an item-by-item basis. 
    For example, under the government's test, they would take the appetizer, the food that goes into the appetizer at a non-member banquet, unrelated function and they would say, we are going to apply the profit motive test to the cost of the food, the expense for the food in that appetizer. 
    Well, obviously, that can't be done. 
    I mean, you can't have a profit motive with respect to an item of expense.

    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    --Well, there is... there is a great deal of control. 
    We would apply the ordinary test. 
    In other words, it can't be a capital item. 
    Even if it's in... the item, the expense, is in the unrelated business activity. 
    It's been classified. 
    It's been put in the unrelated business basket. 
    But still, it has to... it will not be deductible if it doesn't pass the ordinary test, the necessary test, the paid or incurred test, the incurred... paid or incurred in a taxable year test, the substantiation test... all the other requirements of a Section 162 trade or business. 
    But we do make one exception. 
    We say, but we don't have to meet the preconditions for a business under Section 162 because the preconditions for an unrelated business under Section 512(a)(3) is in Section 512(a)(3) and you can't apply two different preconditions for a business.

    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    --It's stipulated in this case that this was a reasonable allocation. 
    But the allocation method that was used is the gross-to-gross method, the gross-to-gross allocation method. 
    And that is the normal allocation method made by... under Section 512(a)(3) and actually by most exempt organizations under Section 512(a)(1) also. 
    That... that allocation method has been approved by the claims court in the Disabled American Veterans case. 
    I think a comparison of Section 512(a)(1) and Section 512(a)(3) confirms our interpretation of the statute.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1048.645" stopTime="1076.314">
    Justice Scalia 
    May I ask you, what... what do you say about the government's main argument that... that the theory you urge would frustrate the whole purpose of the provision, which is not to let people who are spending money on their own entertainment in... in effect to get tax deductions for it by allowing their investment income that is used for that activity to be tax-free.
speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="1076.314" stopTime="1233.799">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    In... in our view, Your Honor, the statute does not tax gross investment income. 
    I mean, I think it's undisputed in this case that the tax... that the Section 512(a)(3) taxes gross investment income less expenses and gross unrelated business food and beverage income less the related expenses. 
    Now, the entertainment... talking about... taking entertainment costs and deducting them from the investment income, in actuality the entertainment-type expenses are covered by the categorization, the division process, in Section 512(a)(3), because you see, the member expenses are actually a type of quasi-personal expense. 
    And that is why Congress placed them in this exempt category. 
    Now, if you look at the legislative history of Section 512(a)(3) of the Code, you'll see that Congress did not want those expenses to be offset against the investment income so they... they provided specific rules to make sure that those losses on the member business were not offset against the investment income. 
    That was the thrust of Section 512(a)(3). 
    And of course, there is no dispute in this case that none of the member expenses... the member losses in our case... are being offset against the investment income. 
    Now, why didn't Congress go further and say that, well, you may have some... some expenses that we didn't catch in this division category that are being offset against the investment income and might be said to be somewhat member related? 
    Why didn't they go further? 
    Well, I think the... the practical reason is that in 1969 tax-exempt social clubs were only allowed to have 5 percent of their total gross receipt represented by all active non-member income, including non-member food and beverage income. 
    So that it really was not a... a major problem in Section... in 1969, the thought that maybe there would be some losses on the non-member side and they would be offset against the... the investment income. 
    So Congress certainly... there was nothing in the legislative history that indicates that they thought that losses on unrelated business... food and beverage business... should not offset the investment income.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1233.799" stopTime="1265.487">
    Justice Scalia 
    How does this gross-to-gross allocation method work? 
    Would you explain it to me? 
    Suppose... suppose I have a club that... it... it originally serves only members, and are there are 100... there are 100 members. 
    And then... then it decides it will serve non-members as well, and it serves one non-member. 
    Now, what is the effect, under your system, of serving that one non-member? 
    What would go along to be deducted from what would otherwise be the profit from the sales to the non-member?
speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="1265.487" stopTime="1276.961">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    All right. 
    Assume, then, that the... for simplicity, that you had one dollar of non-member income and $99 of member income in that situation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1276.961" stopTime="1277.478">
    Justice Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="leonard_j_henzke_jr" startTime="1277.478" stopTime="1306.064">
    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    All right. 
    And the fixed expenses of the club were... that... that would be your gross receipts. 
    The fixed expenses of the club were $1,000. 
    So, under that, then 99 percent of the fixed expenses would go... would be allocated to the non-member business and 1 percent of the expenses would be allocated to the member business. 
    Now, you have to realize it will never be more than 15 percent because there's a 15 percent limit now under the current Code.

    --Well, they're under... some of them may be... the gross-to-gross method may be accurate. 
    Some it may overstate; some it may understate. 
    It just depends. 
    The more non-member business you have, the greater will be your fixed expense deductions.

    Yes. 
    If he's sponsored by a member. 
    I'd just... I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about our alternative argument that Petitioner had a profit motive. 
    The unanimous tax court in the North Ridge Country Club opinion applied here, assumed that Section 512(a)(3) required a profit motive, and the court found that both clubs had a profit motive based on all the facts and circumstances. 
    I don't have time to go through all those facts and circumstances, but I think that significant here is that the gross receipt here exceeded the variable cost by $50,000 in the two years in issue, and that they... under the actual use method, which took into account the fixed expenses, we had a profit here of $45,000 in two years. 
    So we submit that the government is wrong in saying that taxable income is a per se requirement for having a profit motive. 
    With this kind of real economic profit, we submit that we had a profit motive even if you determine under Section 512(a)(3) that a profit motive is required. 
    And we think that the tax court rationale for making that determination on a facts and circumstances basis is consistent with this Court's decision in the... in the Groetzinger case.

   Argument of Clifford M. Sloan
speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="1563.298" stopTime="1733.725">
    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In 1969 Congress enacted a provision addressing the tax treatment of the income of social clubs and in that provision Congress treated social clubs differently from other tax-exempt organizations. 
    With respect to other tax-exempt organizations, Congress imposed a tax only on the income from an unrelated trade or business. 
    With respect to social clubs, Congress imposed a tax on all income except for what was called the exempt function income which was primarily the payments from members for the purposes of the club. 
    Congress was explicit in the legislative history about the reason for this different treatment. 
    With respect to other tax-exempt organizations, the concern was a concern about unfair competition. 
    It was a concern that if a tax-exempt organization engaged in a trade or business in competition with a taxable entity, the tax-exempt organization would have an unfair competitive advantage. 
    With respect to social clubs, Congress explicitly stated in the legislative history that there was that concern, but there was another concern as well. 
    And the additional concern had to do with the entire reason for the exemption for social clubs in the first place. 
    The reason for the exemption for social clubs was so as not to penalize individuals for coming together and pooling their resources for their pleasure and recreation activities. 
    But Congress specifically noted, to the extent that outside income was not taxed, it represented a tax subsidy. 
    And in the words of Congress, such a subsidy would be a distortion of the purpose of the exemption. 
    Well, in the legislative history Congress specifically identified investment income as the kind of income that it sought to tax of social clubs, and it specifically identified the failure to tax investment income as the kind of tax subsidy that it sought to prevent. 
    For the tax years in question, Petitioner received more than $33,000 in income from its investments. 
    Yet, Petitioner claims that it is entitled to pay no taxes on that investment income because Petitioner claims that what Congress actually did in 1969 was create a special favorable tax rule for social clubs in which, unlike other taxpayers, social clubs can deduct losses from an activity and apply those losses to another activity and offset the income and eliminate any tax on it without any showing that the activity generating the losses was engaged in for profit. 
    Alternatively, Petitioner suggests that it should be able to claim that certain expenses are directly connected to the production of income for the purpose of claiming deductions and at the same time deny that they are related to the production of income at all for the purpose of evaluating the profit motive.

    Whatever I make on the sandwiches I sell to non-members is... is gravy. 
    That's a profit motive if you look at it one way.

    You have to consider the... all the club facilities that go behind selling this one sandwich and you say that's no profit motive. 
    Well, you know, in a real sense it is a profit motive. 
    For that purpose, you want to segment the two... the... the... or you want to merge the two. 
    But then for the other purpose of whether you can take the deduction, you say, oh, no, that these two things are entirely separate.

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --No, we're not saying that they're... that they're entirely separate in terms of the profit motive. 
    We allow them to offset their... the expenses up to the level of the last penny that they get from the sale of the food and drinks to non-members. 
    They don't have to pay any tax at all on that. 
    But that is not from segmenting the activity. 
    That is from a basic principle that's been long-established that a taxpayer can offset the expenses of a not-for-profit activity. 
    So, that's perfectly consistent with our view. 
    Our view is in both instances and the justification in both instances is because the activity is not for profit. 
    Now, we do agree... we completely agree... that you have to take into account both the direct costs and the indirect costs for the purposes of evaluating the profit motive.

    That doesn't go to whether somehow some special additional rule is created that allows you to offset the investment income altogether.

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    We have accepted this method of allocation, Your Honor, and in the record... not only for these tax years in... not only for the specific tax years in question, but for 1975 to 1984 there is regularly nothing but losses which are shown by Petitioner for this activity and for this allocation method. 
    So there's no question... there's never been any suggestion here that Petitioner intends to have receipts which exceed the combination of the indirect costs. 
    Petitioner's intent here is clear. 
    It's to have cash coming in in excess of the direct costs, but not to be in excess of the direct costs and the indirect costs as they... as they have been allocated here. 
    Now... so when you look at this repeated pattern and there's no suggestion that they have any intention of having a profit under this standard, it's clear that they're engaging in it for not-for-profit purposes. 
    Now, the question arises, and perhaps this is what Justice Scalia's question was going to to some extent, why then would they do it? 
    Why would an entity continue to have losses? 
    Somehow that seems counterintuitive. 
    And the answer to that question relates to the unique role of social clubs in terms of their dual uses. 
    That they have... their primary activity is a not-for-profit activity, and then they have this incidental other activity to generate some cash in excess of the direct costs, which will help defray the costs of the--

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --Well, it is... it is not like any business because any business has a profit motive. 
    Any business certainly has a... has an incentive to maximize its off-use facilities and so on. 
    But no business in the situation where it has a not-for-profit purpose the way that the social club does or tax-exempt organizations as its primary purposes. 
    And so it arises in that context. 
    Really what it's analogous to is not to the situation of other businesses, which have a profit motive for all of their activities, but to situations... the dual-use cases in which a taxpayer has property for a particular not-for-profit purpose, usually recreation, and the property is something like a yacht or a vacation house or a horse or a horse farm and on particular days of the year the taxpayer seeks to rent out that property and generate some additional cash to help defray the costs of the not-for-profit purpose. 
    And the courts have said in that circumstance it's clear that in order to look at profit motive it... it is not sufficient to look solely at the cash coming in in excess of the direct costs, but the whole picture has to be considered, including proper allocation of the indirect costs. 
    That's what distinguishes the... the social clubs, this dual-use character.

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --Well, because of the phrase "deductions allowed by this chapter", Justice White. 
    The statute doesn't... does not suggest some kind of mechanical mathematical formula in which you just add together the income and then subtract the deductions. 
    It's a specific requirement. 
    For deductions there are two requirements. 
    They have to be directly connected to the production of the income. 
    But they also have to be deductions allowed by this chapter. 
    And so the very... the structure and the text of the statute points to other provisions in Chapter 1 for determining whether a deduction is allowed. 
    And in this case, Petitioner claims that its deductions are allowed under Section 162 of the Code. 
    And so one would look to Section 162. 
    In Section 162, it is clear, requires a profit motive for a trade or business.

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --There's no necessity to have a trade or business to be taxed. 
    Then if one wants to claim a deduction, one has to show that the... that the deduction is authorized by a provision of Chapter 1 of the Code. 
    Now, the provision the petitioner is invoking is Section 162. 
    To invoke that provision, one must be a trade or business. 
    Now, the fact that Section 162 generally requires a profit motive is clear. 
    This Court has reiterated that point recently in the Groetzinger and the American Bar Endowment cases, numerous courts of appeals decisions have held it. 
    And the fact that that was the general rule of Section 162 should be sufficient to address Petitioner's, claim because Petitioner and other social clubs should be fully applicable to that requirement because that is the applicable provision under Chapter 1 of the Code that they are invoking for the deduction. 
    The petitioner makes this plain meaning argument that because it... something... it comes within the scope of the tax it is automatically a trade or business. 
    And, as we've discussed, the tax and the structure of the provision do not support that because they point elsewhere for the rules of deduction. 
    They point to the other provisions--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2516.602" stopTime="2522.656">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, they do... Section 512(a)(1) does refer to unrelated business taxable income.
speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="2522.656" stopTime="2523.056">
    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --That's--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2523.056" stopTime="2526.691">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And so what we're saying in that section, we're dealing with a business.
speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="2526.691" stopTime="2547.838">
    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    --Well, it... it uses the term... Chief Justice Rehnquist, it uses the term "unrelated business taxable income". 
    Congress uses that term in two very different ways. 
    In Section 512(a)(1) it is using it for almost all tax-exempt organizations, and it refers only to income from an unrelated trade or business. 
    And that term had been in the statute since the 1950s.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2547.838" stopTime="2550.689">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, it uses the same thing in 512(a)(3)(A).
speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="2550.689" stopTime="2691.932">
    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    That's right. 
    And in 512(a)(3)(A) in 1969 Congress says, this term that we've been using in 512(a)(1) to refer only to an unrelated... income from an unrelated trade or business, which is basically the tax that we're imposing on non-exempt income, it's going to mean something entirely different for social clubs. 
    It's going to... it's going to have a much broader scope and it's going to refer to gross income of all kinds, not only to a trade or business. 
    And... and Congress specifically included in that provision that deductions must be allowed under Chapter 1. 
    And so it points to the other provisions of Chapter 1. 
    Now, Petitioner claims to be making a plain meaning argument based on the fact that the term "unrelated business taxable income" is used and even though it had been used in an entirely business context. 
    But Petitioner pulls back from the reach of its plain meaning argument. 
    In Petitioner's words, the statute shouldn't be read too literally, even though it is making a plain meaning argument. 
    And Petitioner suggests this economic gain test where if non-members pay a nominal fee for a function in which members participate and the fees from the non-members do not exceed the direct costs of providing that activity, then that situation is not entitled to the trade or business situation... to the trade or business treatment. 
    Now, under Petitioner's plain meaning argument that clearly should be the result because the fees from the non-members are taxable income. 
    They're gross income, they're not from members, so they're unrelated business taxable income. 
    And, therefore, under Petitioner's view, they should be automatically a trade or business and entitled to very large Section 162 losses. 
    But Petitioner pulls back from the reach of that because that exactly would be clearly contrary to Congress' intent. 
    The problem with Petitioner's suggestion of this economic gain test is that it is anchored nowhere either in the specific provision relating to social clubs or in the other provisions of Chapter 1 to which the social club provision specifically points. 
    And there is no need to create a new test out of whole cloth in order to address that kind of situation because there is a readily available test that fully addresses that situation, and that test is the profit motive which other taxpayers have to meet under Section 162.

    That's right. 
    It's an offset of expenses that the Commissioner permits. 
    Now, it's conceivable that one could argue that the Commissioner is... is being too generous in that respect. 
    It is, as the Five Lakes Club suggests, a long-standing principle and judicially recognized, as is stated in their case. 
    But again, that goes to the point about whether a tax should have been imposed on the sale of food and drinks to non-members, whether that offset should have been disallowed altogether. 
    And it suggests that perhaps the Commissioner, if anything, was being too generous in that respect. 
    But that does not allow and that is no justification for creating a special rule that allows the offset of the investment income.

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    That's correct, Justice O'Connor. 
    But there is absolutely no suggestion that the Commissioner intends to take that position or has taken that position. 
    And it's precisely because of a concern about taxing gross income as opposed to net income in the circumstance. 
    So it's important to realize that Petitioner's arguments, either its primary argument that it should be excused from the generally applicable profit motive requirement, or its argument that it should be able to claim that certain expenses are directly connected for the purpose of claiming a deduction and then say that they're not related at all for the purpose of evaluating their profit motive, would go... would clearly be contrary to Congress' legislative purpose and go a long way toward nullifying the tax on investment income that Congress thought it was imposing in 1969. 
    It is relatively easy and common for social clubs to structure their sales to non-members in exactly the way the petitioner has here and to eliminate any tax on their investment income. 
    Now, if the text of the statute required this result, it might be an example of an unintended tax loophole by Congress. 
    But far from compelling that result, the text of the statute points in exactly the opposite direction and in the direction entirely consistent with the purpose that Congress explicitly stated in passing the provision in 1969.

 If the old fashioned definition of unrelated business taxable income had not been... if that term had not been specially defined... redefined for clubs, is it correct that the interest income would not have been taxable because the interest income in itself would not have been an unrelated business income?

    Mr. Clifford M. Sloan 
    That's correct. 
    That... that is correct. 
    That was exactly what Congress was trying to do in 1969. 
    It's explicit under the statute that investment income that is not included in the taxable income of a tax-exempt organization and is included for a social club. 
    That... that's explicit under the statute and in the legislative history.

    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    May it please the Court: 
    I'd like to first address the question of whether the... the government is correct in stating that since the burden of proof is on us, then the burden is on us to somehow come up with some specific provision in the regulations or something which allows us to take this deduction. 
    I think that the government's contention confuses what is a factual burden... a burden of factual... burden of proof is on us. 
    But we contend that the plain ordinary meaning of Section 512(a)(3) allows us to take these deductions because it says that all... everything that's not exempt function income and deduction is to be put in this other basket, the unrelated basket. 
    And once you get the unrelated basket, all the items of income and... income and deduction are to be aggregated. 
    And--

    Mr. Leonard J. Henzke, Jr. 
    Well, in this... in this particular case it was done routinely until Revenue Ruling 81-69 was... was promulgated. 
    And certainly the Sixth Circuit and the tax... tax court both stated that the proposed regulation, which was outstanding then, allowed this kind of offset. 
    And the... as we've said in our brief, the government's own manual for instruction of... of revenue agents continually cited proposed... those proposed regulations as being the proper way to interpret the Code from 1969 through 1981.

    Your Honor in... in Section 512(a)(1) the... the situation is sort of reversed.
