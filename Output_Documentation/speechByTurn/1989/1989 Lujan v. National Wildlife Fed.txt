    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    That court held that Respondent had standing to challenge hundreds of Bureau of Land Management land orders entered over the course of several years affecting 180 million acres of public lands in 17 states. 
    The court concluded that a single affidavit of one of Respondent's members, Peggy Kay Peterson, was sufficient to confer that standing. 
    In her affidavit Ms. Peterson claimed that she used Federal lands in the vicinity of the South Pass/Green Mountain area of Wyoming, and she claimed that she was injured by a BLM decision to open that area to the staking of mining claims. 
    The district court found that the area in question covered some 2 million acres, of which only 6,000 acres had ever been closed to mining, and of those 6,000 the BLM decision only opened 4,500 to the staking of mining claims. 
    The court noted that Peterson's affidavit said nothing about using the 4,500 affected acres and, therefore, concluded that she had shown no injury and that Respondent, therefore, had no standing.

    That claim was in the Greenwalt declaration, one of the other of the three original affidavits that were submitted by Respondent. 
    The claim there was that the organization had standing in its own right, without regard to any injury to its particular members.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And the district court, we believe, correctly concluded that that declaration, the Greenwalt declaration, was completely conclusory and devoid of specific facts.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    With respect, Your Honor, no, it did not reach the Greenwalt declaration. 
    It didn't pass on that, choosing to rest its decision entirely on the Peterson affidavit. 
    The district court, however, did address the Greenwalt declaration and found it, as I've indicated, conclusory and devoid of fact. 
    It is, as I've mentioned, the Sierra Club case all over again. 
    In fact, it's... it's helpful to compare the allegation of standing in the Sierra Club case with that in the Greenwalt declaration. 
    They're really quite similar. 
    Each of them says our organization has experience and expertise in conservation. 
    We're vitally interested in this issue. 
    In the Sierra Club case the affidavit said we responsibly serve and represent our members. 
    In the Greenwalt declaration, Ms. Greenwalt claimed that the organization needed information and public participation in order to represent their members. 
    But this court in the Morton case said that that sort of interest was insufficient to confer standing because it was in no way distinct from the interest any citizen could claim coming in the courthouse and saying I'm interested in this subject. 
    Turning back to the Peterson affidavit, what Ms. Peterson claimed was that she used land in the vicinity of this 2 million acre parcel, the South Pass/Green Mountain area of Wyoming. 
    The District... the D.C. Circuit on appeal presumed that she meant to say something else. 
    It presumed that she meant to say she used the 4,500 affected acres. 
    The reasoning was that she claimed that she was injured, claimed that she had standing, and she would only be injured and only have standing if she used the 4,500 acres and, therefore, she must have meant to say that she used those 4,500 acres. 
    This is exactly backwards. 
    Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. 
    The presumption is that they are without jurisdiction, and the plaintiff must affirmatively prove that he has standing to invoke the power of the court. 
    The court of appeals presumed Peterson meant to say she used the 4,500 acres because otherwise she wouldn't have standing. 
    But what Peterson said is that she was in the vicinity of this 2 million acre area, not even within the 2 million acres, just in the vicinity. 
    Even assuming we can place Peterson somewhere within the 2 million acres, the court of appeals had no basis for drastically narrowing the focus of her allegations on the 0.225 percent of that area that was the only area affected by the challenged decision.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Roberts, does the term South Pass/Green Mountains area have some connotation in the BLM's undertaking or was that just an area designated by Ms. Peterson?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="284.099" stopTime="290.153">
    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No. 
    It's an area that's familiar to people in central western Wyoming. 
    That's what the area is.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="290.153" stopTime="298.943">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, I know that, but is it anything more than just a geographical designation selected by the... by Ms. Peterson?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="298.943" stopTime="476.158">
    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, it is. 
    It is the term that the... the Bureau used in the land use planning process. 
    I refer the court to page 132 of the Joint Appendix, the affidavit of Jack Kelly, who's the administrator of the area, in which he refers to the South Pass/Green Mountain area as consisting of these... these 2 million acres. 
    By any token, it is a vast expanse. 
    South Pass is some 55 miles from Green Mountain. 
    So, even taking the allegation as narrowly as possible on its face, what she's referring to is essentially the equivalent of being in the vicinity of the Baltimore-Washington area. 
    And it's important to remember that there's never been any mystery about where these 4,500 acres are. 
    This isn't a case where she alleged a vast area because she didn't know where the government was affecting the lands. 
    Two years before her affidavit was filed the Bureau published in the Federal Register a very exact designation of the parcels comprising the 4,500 acres. 
    Respondent knew this. 
    It cited the Federal Register notice in its complaint. 
    Therefore, if we're going to indulge in presumptions, the more reasonable presumption would be that if Peterson or any other of Respondent's members could have alleged that they used those particular 4,500 acres, they would have. 
    But neither Peterson nor anyone else did. 
    Now, the court of appeals compounded its error many times over when it ruled that the Peterson affidavit conferred standing on Respondent to challenge not only the South Pass/Green Mountain order, but hundreds of other BLM orders affecting another 178 million acres of public lands throughout the West... this, despite the fact that the Peterson affidavit said nothing beyond the confines of South Pass and Green Mountain. 
    Respondent's argument on this score is that it's complaining about a program, that BLM has a program to review land classifications and land withdrawals. 
    In a certain sense this is true. 
    Such review is a very big part of what the Bureau of Land Management does. 
    But saying they have a program to review land use classifications is like saying that NASA has a program to explore space or the Department of Justice has a program to prosecute criminals. 
    Of course they do. 
    That's what the agency does. 
    But it's beside the point so far as standing is concerned. 
    The Respondent relies for its standing on section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    That provision gives a right to judicial review to a person who is aggrieved by final agency action. 
    The Respondent cannot be aggrieved by the sort of program it complains about. 
    It may not like the way the BLM is going about its business. 
    It may even think that the BLM is violating the law in the way it goes about its business. 
    But until that program or policy culminates in a final agency action, Respondent is not aggrieved. 
    The final agency actions in this case are the land orders.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Your Honor, the failure to prepare an environmental impact statement is not final agency action. 
    The way that that can be challenged is when the final agency action... in this case a land order... is taken, you can then go into court and say I'm affected by what the agency did, its final action. 
    And the wrong is that they took that action without preparing an environmental impact statement. 
    They weren't fully informed as they would be if they had done that. 
    But it still must wait for the final agency action, and the fact that there is a... a program or policy, which is really just saying this is the way the agency goes about its work, is not enough to confer standing. 
    You need the concrete agency action.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Absolutely, and that's... that's not an unusual result. 
    It's no different than the situation that applies, for example, when in a particular case one district court declares an act of Congress unconstitutional. 
    That doesn't mean that the act cannot be enforced against other people in other districts, and obviously the government tries as quickly as possible to get the case to this Court which has nationwide jurisdiction to decide the issue, but the act is not unconstitutional across the board.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, the court of appeals can say it, but it doesn't apply to all cases. 
    It only applies to the cases of which the court of appeals has jurisdiction; and, to the extent the court of appeals writes a persuasive opinion, the reasoning of that court will presumably sway other courts when they are confronted with the particular plaintiff suffering particular injury from a particular order. 
    Now, these principles are particularly important in this case because these land orders are not all of one cloth. 
    They're very different. 
    To cite just one example, 31 of the challenged land orders govern some 5 million acres of land in Montana. 
    There were classifications that protected that land against entry under the Homestead Act. 
    You couldn't go in there and set up... your... your homestead. 
    In 1976, however, Congress in the Federal Land Policy Management Act repealed the Homestead Act, so these 31 classifications were essentially moot. 
    They protected against a threat that no longer existed. 
    They couldn't... and terminating those classifications, as the BLM did, couldn't possibly aggrieve anyone. 
    It was a paper transaction. 
    And yet, the respondent was given standing to challenge those 31 orders based on the Peterson affidavit, which of course had nothing to do with Montana at all. 
    Respondents' theory on this point seems to be that they can bring within to one lawsuit all the agency actions that they think are vulnerable to the same legal theory on which they hope to prevail in the action before the court, but that has never been recognized as sufficient to confer standing--

    The court of appeals gave the Federation standing for the hundreds of other land orders affecting all 178 million additional acres.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    But the fact of the matter is, understanding doctrine, the plaintiff has to show that he has been injured by each agency action as to which he seeks relief. 
    The Federation seeks relief, for example, for those 31 land orders I discussed in Montana, but they've not even attempted to show that they've been injured by those, and as I've indicated, I don't think anyone could be injured by those land orders. 
    As the Court noted in Allen against Wright, the standing focuses on whether the particular plaintiff can raise the particular claims asserted. 
    The particular claim that's asserted in this case covers the hundreds of land orders throughout the West, and yet this particular Plaintiff has shown, we think, standing as to none but, at most, standing as to the particular injury claimed in the affidavits. 
    Now the court of appeals' decision in this regard giving the Federation nationwide standing based on one injury to a particular plaintiff under one land order raises the most serious separation of powers concerns because it aggregates in the district court all of the Bureau of Land Management orders since 1981, even though before that district court is one plaintiff complaining of one order. 
    Those types of separation of powers concerns are precisely what the standing doctrine is designed to avoid. 
    Turning briefly to the question of the supplemental affidavits, I'd first point out as I mentioned in response to Justice Stevens that those would certainly not end the case even if they were... should have been admitted because they go, again, only to particular plaintiffs' particular land orders. 
    If the Court disagrees with us on those and if, in fact, the supplemental affidavits establish standing, it would only be to the limited parcels, the limited orders mentioned in those affidavits. 
    Now, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit these affidavits more than one month after the deadline set in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) and in violation of the court order. 
    Respondent chose as a deliberate trial tactic over the course of several years to rest on its initial three affidavits and to resist at every turn any further development of the factual record on standing. 
    The district court was on the scene and aware of all the circumstances and properly exercised its discretion in refusing to reopen the factual record after the summary judgment hearing.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, it had our motion on summary judgment specifically directed to standing. 
    Now, it may have been overconfident as to its standing, but our motion certainly put it on notice that we, at least, didn't think the issue was dead. 
    And in addition, the first court of appeals opinion addressed the issue of standing in the context of a motion to dismiss. 
    As this Court noted in the SCRAP decision, the standards on a motion to dismiss and summary judgment, this case, are very different, so they shouldn't have been lulled into overconfidence on the basis of the prior panel decision. 
    Furthermore, the district court had not seen these affidavits when it wrote its preliminary injunction decision. 
    This was the district court's first opportunity to rule on standing with the affidavits before it.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --We... if... I'm not quite certain, Your Honor. 
    I believe that we objected to the submission of them in our reply. 
    They were attached to a legal memorandum that the respondent submitted. 
    My recollection is that we objected to them, but I'm not certain of that. 
    I noted that the district court in ruling that the affidavits were untimely and in violation of its order cited the Federal parties' reply brief, and I believe that's where we did object to the supplemental affidavits. 
    When we moved for summary judgment on standing, that was the opportunity for the respondent, if it wanted to submit additional facts, to do so. 
    That's the standard practice. 
    The party moves for summary judgment, submits its affidavits. 
    The opposing party under Rule 56 is entitled to submit opposing affidavits prior to the date of the hearing. 
    Respondent deliberately chose not to do that. 
    It chose to rest on its original three affidavits, and in its opposition papers it claimed that those affidavits were "far more than is necessary" to establish its standing. 
    It was only at the hearing when it became evident that Respondent's standing was in serious doubt that the respondent changed its tune, and something on the order of a month later submitted these supplemental factual affidavits, as the district court found, in violation of Rule 56(c) and in violation of the court's order which requested additional memoranda. 
    Now, the respondent has cited no case, and we are aware of none, in which a court of appeals has held that a district court abused its discretion in excluding affidavits that it found to be untimely and in violation of the court order. 
    And for the reasons I've mentioned this would be a very curious case to be the first one. 
    Respondent had several years to further develop its standing allegations. 
    For reasons of its own it chose not to, and it can't be given... I wouldn't call it a second chance... a third or a fourth chance, after the hearing was over. 
    If this was an abuse of discretion by the trial court, it's hard to imagine when a trial court has discretion to call an end to the development of the factual record.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.

    But your objection is... is one that could be made in almost any standing case... certainly could have been made in the Sierra Club against Morton case. 
    I don't think there was any serious doubt in that case that members of the Sierra Club actually used Mineral King, but they chose not to make that allegation. 
    The fact that another lawsuit could be brought at another time by another party on different allegations is no excuse to circumvent the standing requirements, which focus on the particular case before the Court.

    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This Court has to reach and resolve two issues before it ever gets to the Peterson affidavit. 
    The first one, of course, is the five supplemental memoranda, and on that issue we have very respectfully suggested to the Court that it might want to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, because what's going on--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You're aware of the rule of Oklahoma City against Tuttle, as codified in our new rules, that any point that is not... does not go to our jurisdiction that should counsel against the grant of certiorari must be raised in the memorandum in opposition?
speaker="e_barrett_prettyman_jr" startTime="1578.662" stopTime="1595.291">
    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    I'm indeed familiar with that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would suggest to you, however, that this kind of suggestion is the same as jurisdiction. 
    That is, that you can raise it at any time yourself. 
    We're not making a motion or anything. 
    We're just suggesting to the Court in using its discretion that it might want to get rid of this case--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Presumably the best time for the Court to have made that decision would have been at the stage were certiorari was being granted. 
    That's the reason for the rule and for the statement in Oklahoma City against Tulsa... Tuttle, that if a case doesn't belong here, we would like to find out about it before we grant certiorari and not during the oral argument.

    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    Well, the point was made about the five supplemental memoranda, and I'm merely suggesting to you that when you... when you hear the situation that you're in at the moment, I think that it would be a case that it's not worth this Court's time to hear, because what you're doing is, you're passing in effect on the discretion of the court of appeals to rule that the district court abused its discretion in a matter of local practice.

    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    --Absolutely. 
    They accompanied the memoranda that was filed a month after the hearing. 
    The hearing was July 22nd, 1988. 
    Up until this time, two courts for three years had told us that we had standing. 
    So we come to this hearing, and even at the beginning of the hearing the court tells the government lawyer that he's probably on the wrong side of this case. 
    We're feeling very comfortable. 
    In the middle of the hearing, the government lawyer gets up and begins reading these facts about RMPs... resource management plans... and about how they've completed all of these plans. 
    We'd alleged in our complaint that they'd only completed nine. 
    Their own affidavit had said they had completed 25, and all of a sudden here he's talking about they've completed 50.

 I mean, there is some argument about the extent to which the government had proceeded, but it seems to me that may go to the scope of relief or something of that sort. 
 I don't see why that determines whether the plaintiffs had standing.

    If we find there's no standing under the Peterson affidavit and that the court of appeals was wrong on the abuse of discretion point, presumably it would be open to the court of appeals on remand to consider whether there is informational standing or whatever you call it.

    I mean, that's an additional qualification.
speaker="e_barrett_prettyman_jr" startTime="2219.745" stopTime="2326.832">
    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    I was going to address that in just a moment. 
    Could I just clear up this one thing? 
    You will see a figure of 1.2 million in the Kelly affidavit, but, believe me, that includes the Crook's Mountain area, and it's like a lot of the government's figures in this case. 
    You can get different results. 
    The best we can figure from the government's own... own evidence is 150,000 acres. 
    Now, all right, let me say what I think happened here, because we're not just looking at the Peterson affidavit. 
    You're looking at the record as a whole. 
    The government's evidence is most important here. 
    Mrs. Peterson swore that she recreated in the vicinity of South Pass and Green Mountain, where the lands have been open to mining and... and this mining threatens the aesthetics and the wildlife, which in turn harms her. 
    Now that's essentially what she said. 
    Then the government comes along and shows that, indeed, 4,455 acres were open to mining in the South Pass and Green Mountain areas, and that has resulted in 406 mining claims being filed and some operations being started, and the government also shows that the mining was not only... not only can but will... has hurt the wildlife and aesthetics in these very same areas. 
    I mean, I can read to you here where the government both in '82 and in '85 and '86 said specifically, for example, in South Pass, these activities... they're talking about dredging and underground tunnels for mining... have an adverse impact on crucial moose habitat, deer habitat, some elk habitat and a variety of small game species. 
    Improvements at campgrounds, as well as land in the immediate vicinity could either be damaged or destroyed. 
    This is not the government talking about--

    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    --No. 
    What I'm saying is that... that when she says that she is using two areas that the government concedes were open to mining and the government concedes were harmed... have been harmed by the mining and that's precisely what she says that she's being harmed by the aesthetics and wildlife that that's enough. 
    Now, obviously, if she just says I'm in the vicinity of Arizona or I'm in the vicinity of the West Coast or I'm in the vicinity of the United States, it's not enough. 
    But you know, it... to parse this down so that she has to set forth each tract like you do in the Federal Register... you can't do that with people who are swearing to this. 
    They don't know... they don't know what these tracts are. 
    What she's saying is that I go up there in this area, and there's the mining, and it's harming me, and the government comes in and says well, yeah, we're mining there, and we'll tell you exactly where it is, and it is doing some harm, but you don't have any standing.

    Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. 
    Well, what about Japan Whaling, Your Honor, that Justice White wrote, where you'll recall that the... the... the... they said just because the conservation group's members enjoyed watching whaling and studying whaling that that was enough to give them standing to challenge the Secretary of Commerce's refusal to condemn Japan for whaling. 
    I mean, that... I mean, there are all kinds of cases from this Court where... what about... what about the Brock case, for example? 
    International Union v. Brock. 
    There... you remember those were the benefits given to union members to... to... to help them against import competition. 
    And the Secretary of Labor there issues a policy handbook, and the union comes in... not all members of the union were affected, and not all those affected were members of the union, but the union comes in and says we represent these people. 
    You didn't require that you go back and show for each union member what wage and what pay and how many hours he worked and so forth. 
    You said that so long as some union members were affected, even though the state agencies were making the decision in that case, that there was standing. 
    In Watt v. Energy Foundation, the... you remember the case where the Secretary of the Interior was... was using different bidding systems, which affected everybody differently. 
    All the parties were affected differently. 
    And you said that there was standing for California to challenge the issue of the regulations and tell him he had to follow the act even though everybody was affected differently. 
    I just don't understand in the context of these other cases why this case is any different. 
    The... Mr. Roberts says... in effect I think what he's saying is that a... that somebody would have to come in and show... all of our members would have to come in and show for each tract, for each little area throughout the United States that they were harmed. 
    That's not... that isn't what you all have said.

    You've got to look at the record as a whole. 
    And I think... the court of appeals never had to do that because it said the Peterson affidavit is all right. 
    But if you're going to look at this Peterson affidavit, you have to look at the... at the... under Rule 56 you have to look at the record as a whole. 
    And the record as a whole, when you throw in the government's evidence, will show you not only that any minor lapses that she left out are filled in, but also that what she claims is going on is going on.

    I must tell you in all candor, I don't know how it was argued in the court of appeals. 
    Well, in... in terms of this so-called presumption, I mean I am happy to try to uphold the court of appeals on a presumption. 
    All I'm saying is I don't think they had to do it. 
    But if... so far as they did do it, I mean if you look at Gladstone Realtors, for example... and that, incidentally, was not a motion to dismiss, that was a summary judgment case... and the Court said that the complaints were conclusory in that case, but we're going to construe them favorably to the Village of Elwood in that case, just as I think you should do here, because after all the other side is the moving party, not us.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I don't know where the number comes from. 
    The district court read South Pass/Green Mountain area to be 2 million acres, and the court of appeals also looked at it that way. 
    That was one of the things they got right. 
    The affidavits establish that we're talking about a 2 million acre area. 
    And it's interesting, the 150,000 doesn't work. 
    It doesn't work because if you're talking just about Green Mountain and South Pass, that's not where all the 4,455 are. 
    Some of them are elsewhere in the area.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Absolutely. 
    Absolutely, and there's no doubt about it. 
    The Federal Register will give you those exact coordinates. 
    My brother referred you to joint appendix page 119, to classification W 6228. 
    Classification W 6228 covers more than 2 million acres. 
    It's the South Pass/Green Mountain area. 
    With respect to the supplemental affidavits, the government lawyer at the hearing responded to correct reliance on some stale data in noting how far they'd gotten in the RMP process. 
    The court told us to mark it as an exhibit. 
    We did so. 
    It had nothing whatever to do with standing. 
    You can read the supplemental affidavits from the beginning to end. 
    You'll see no mention of the RMP exhibit that the court added to the record to make sure it was not relying on stale data. 
    The was some discussion earlier about sending it back to the court of appeals to look through the record to see if Peterson had standing. 
    That's not a court's job. 
    That's the plaintiff's job. 
    They have the obligation to affirmatively establish their standing. 
    They failed to do so in this case. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
