    Justice Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the National Labor Relations Board acted within its discretion in refusing to admit a presumption that Board’s replacements refuse and are opposed to the striking union. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Scalia had filed a separate dissenting opinion in which Justice O’Connor and Justice Kennedy have joined.
