    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In this case, the federal diversity statute provides that in a direct action against a liability insurer, the insurer shall be deemed a citizen of the same state as the insured for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. 
    Today, we hold that this proviso does not apply to a Texas Workers' Compensation action brought in Federal Court by another state insurer. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
