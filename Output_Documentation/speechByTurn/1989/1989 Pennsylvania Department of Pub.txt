    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 89-156, Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. Edward J. Davenport. 
    Mr. Cohen.

    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court in this case is whether Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 intended that a criminal convicted of welfare fraud and sentenced to pay restitution as a condition of probation in a state court can walk out of the state courthouse and into the federal courthouse to have the judge's criminal restitution order wiped out in a bankruptcy process. 
    The facts of the case are not in dispute. 
    The defendants in September of 1986 entered guilty pleas. 
    They were sentenced to pay restitution in the amount of $4,145 at the rate of $208 per defendant per month payable to the county probation department. 
    A period of months passed. 
    They failed to pay and they then proceeded in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. 
    The probation department of the county filed a previolation notice and subsequently held a hearing and then the bankruptcy court instituted an adversary proceeding at the instance of the Respondents and an order was entered discharging the state court restitution sentence as a debt. 
    That decision was reversed by the judge in the Eastern District based upon this Court's reasoning in Kelly v. Robinson. 
    But the Third Circuit in a two-to-one decision reversed and the order of discharge stood, cert was granted by this Court to address the question of whether a restitution order is a debt that is dischargeable in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. 
    It is Petitioners' position that Congress did not intend to void a lawful state court criminal sentence in any way through the bankruptcy process or in particular here through a Chapter 13 proceeding. 
    To have done so would have trampled on the principles of federalism in comity that this Court in 1971 in Younger v. Harris discussed so thoroughly where the Court recognized the fundamental policy in our system of government against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions. 
    Further, the language of the Bankruptcy Code does not clearly spell out that criminal court orders of this nature are to be voided through discharge in a Chapter 13 proceeding. 
    Additionally, there was a string of pre-Code cases going back as far as the case of In re Moore in Kentucky Bankruptcy Court in 1901 where courts refused to discharge criminal restitution sentences. 
    That is very important under the test that the Supreme Court set forth in the Midlantic case and the Court said that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially-created concept, it makes that intent specific.

    The criminal court orders were not... they were dischargeable, but under the definition of debt. 
    I'm sorry, they were not dischargeable. 
    But under the definition of debt, which was a much narrower definition at that time, they did not fall under that definition.

    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    Yes, Your Honor, and In re Moore is one of them. 
    But it's... it's a whole string of cases cited in our brief that stands for that proposition. 
    In the Ron Pair Enterprises case, this Court also said that we must look very carefully to its clear expression of congressional intent when there is a clear conflict with state and federal laws of great importance. 
    Here the conflict is between the Bankruptcy Code and the criminal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
    In Kelly v. Robinson, this Court said you must look to... one must look to the whole law. 
    And if we do that, we find no solid specific evidence of any congressional intent to change that pre-Code law to allow for discharge of criminal sentences.

    You can't send somebody to jail if they cannot afford to pay it. 
    But a sanction of going to jail does not give the victim in this case, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, any right to collect the money. 
    This is not a civil judgment order, in other words. 
    It is a criminal sentence.

    Yes, Your Honor, but a criminal restitution sentence... and this is specifically in Pennsylvania, but I don't think that we're asking this Court to just hold for Pennsylvania obviously... but specifically in the Pennsylvania statute, a restitution order for welfare fraud can continue even beyond the term of possible sentence for the underlying crime, which in this case was seven years. 
    So that the probation order and the restitution order can continue far beyond the three-year period of consideration for the issue of what is available for the creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.

    If this Court had a civil judgment order in front of it. 
    But what this Court has is a criminal sentence from another court, a court that is enforcing the criminal laws of the state, a court that is making a judgment of what is the purpose of the sentencing process. 
    And it is our position, which we advance of course in the briefs, that the purpose of a restitution sentence is the same as any other sentence. 
    It is for purposes of rehabilitation of the defendant. 
    It is for deterrence, retribution, punishment, but it is not to collect the debt that is owed.

    The restitution order came before any proceeding in bankruptcy. 
    The restitution order was a valid order. 
    If he were to challenge that order, that should be challenged through the state court process.

    Restitution for something that the bankruptcy court has said that he doesn't owe but that the criminal court judge can still say is a violation of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the judgment made by the state legislature. 
    And that's why in this discussion I think we are pointing out the whole problem of did Congress of the United States intend to limit the authority of a state court judge or to wipe out the sentence of a state court judge where the judge is enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth, laws that the state legislature are suppose to be able to enact to protect the citizens and laws, in fact in this instance, that this Court in Bowen v. Roy indicated were important laws... the ability of the state to police welfare fraud.

    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I... I would say in response directly to your question that the fine, penalty or forfeiture that the Congress is speaking of there is a civil fine, penalty or forfeiture, not a criminal fine, penalty or forfeiture. 
    There is no discussion... and that's why we are standing here talking about congressional intent... there is no discussion of criminal fines, penalty, or forfeiture. 
    In fact, the Congress said that the bankruptcy laws are not to be a have for criminal offenders. 
    The bankruptcy laws are intended to protect honest debtors attempting, when they are financially overextended, to have a fresh start and not to protect criminal offenders.

    No. 
    In Kelly v. Robinson this Court... Justice Powell, in fact, writing for the majority quoted Justice Powell writing for the descent in TVA v. Hill, the Snaildarter case, and he said... this was in the majority opinion... that if Congress had intended to discharge state criminal sentences, we can be certain that there would have been hearings, testimony, and debate concerning consequences so likely to arouse public outrage. 
    In other congressional acts, such as the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Congress very clearly intended to highlight restitution as a criminal sanction. 
    In the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, Congress showed its intent again that restitution be a sanction in the savings and loan scandals. 
    In the automatic stay provision which is where the... during the course of the debate on the automatic stay, where the Congress indicated that the bankruptcy laws... and they didn't just the automatic stay provision, they said the bankruptcy laws are not intended to be a haven for criminal offenders. 
    And that section... it would be contradictory to then allow an offender to escape a sentence if in fact there is an exception to a stay to allow criminal proceedings to commence or to continue. 
    In the preferential transfer provisions, which weighed transfers for the benefit of a creditor on account of a debt owed within 90 days... in that situation, under the ruling of the Third Circuit, the criminal restitution order is a debt and the Department of Public Welfare here is a creditor, the Department would have to pay back the money. 
    They would have to refund the restitution payments made under the state court judge's order.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but it's not all debts that are preferences. 
    I mean if a payment is made on a debt within 90 days, the reason it's a preference is because there's nothing exchanged for the time. 
    It's a pre-existing debt. 
    Isn't that the reason?
speaker="walter_w_cohen" startTime="1296.946" stopTime="1358.887">
    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    That's correct and it's money that otherwise should be available to all of the creditors in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding. 
    I'm sorry, I thought Justice Scalia was not focused on the preferential transfer provision, but on the underlying issue before the Court. 
    The whole question of the role of the federal government vis-a-vis role of the state government, the issues raised by this Court in Younger v. Harris lead to an infringement on the sovereignty of the states if the federal court can determine that a criminal court judge cannot take into consideration all of the factors, all of the sanction alternatives that are left available to the court in a criminal sentence and decide what is the most appropriate sentence to rehabilitate, to protect the people and to punish the offender.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    As a matter of fact, Mr. Cohen, in Pennsylvania is restitution often imposed as the only criminal sanction or is it usually accompanied by a fine or a... or a criminal sentence?

    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    In this case, for example, Your Honor, it was a condition of probation imposed along with court costs so that court costs were separate from the restitution order which was a condition of the probation sentence of one year. 
    But it can be imposed in a variety of different ways. 
    It was, as I mentioned, 5,000 times it was imposed as a sentence or as a condition of probation, but in many of those instance it was a--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1407.533" stopTime="1420.710">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Do you think if... if the Third Circuit view prevails, the Pennsylvania criminal court would have difficulty revoking probation for failure to pay the restitution?
speaker="walter_w_cohen" startTime="1420.710" stopTime="1440.541">
    Mr. Walter W. Cohen 
    --It would have difficulty. 
    I think that they could still do that, but the problem would be they could only do that once there was a determination at the time that the court was proceeding to the probation hearing that the person had the ability to pay.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1440.541" stopTime="1454.264">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, why... why would ability to pay be critical in deciding whether or not because the... it's dischargeable in bankruptcy, you could nonetheless revoke probation for failure to pay it?

    Mr. Walter W. Cohen

    Well, supposing there was a determination that the defendant did have the ability to pay, but nonetheless the Third Circuit's view is upheld here and we say this is a debt dischargeable in bankruptcy.

    And the whole restitution process, the whole victim's rights movement that has grown so strongly in the '80s as a part of the criminal justice system, will take a large step backwards.

    Mr. David A. Searles

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Searles, if the Third Circuit view is upheld here, do you think that a Pennsylvania criminal court could revoke this particular Respondents' probation for failure to make the restitution payment?
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="1634.082" stopTime="1678.945">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    Your Honor, I think it depends whether the restitution order is an independent component of the criminal sentence or whether it's a condition of probation. 
    In this case it was originally a condition of probation, but the probation has expired. 
    All that remains is the order to pay restitution. 
    And if the criminal court were to try to compel payment of the restitution after discharge, I think that would be inappropriate under Section 524, under the statutory injunction against collecting discharged debts. 
    If there were still a condition of probation and the restitution had been discharged, then I think the answer would depend on state law, which is could the state court judge modify or revoke probation when the original conditions of probation have proved impossible or infeasible.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1678.945" stopTime="1688.051">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you wouldn't see the federal Bankruptcy Code as a bar to revocation of probation in the latter situation.
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="1688.051" stopTime="1708.847">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    It would be a bar insofar as in an attempt to collect money that had been discharged... a debt that had been discharged. 
    But I think the answer would be up to the state courts to determine on a case-to-case basis which is, depending on state law, having to do with an original condition of probation having become infeasible.

    Mr. David A. Searles 
    That's... court... the Congress' statutory injunction against collection of a discharged debt. 
    But I think what the defendant in that case would do would be to go to state court, present his thorough law defense. 
    As the Third Circuit has held in the Davis case, we can presume that state courts are going to uphold federal law defenses and let the state court decide that based on state law.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but are... you know, the last clause is almost meaningless so far as I can tell. 
    If federal law prevents the revocation of probation after the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, why say let state courts decide according to state law? 
    It's being controlled by federal law, isn't it?

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, does the state court have any option if the federal defense is a good one? 
    You don't just say, well, let them decide it for themselves.

    During the bankruptcy when there was motion to revoke probation, the Davenports voluntarily went back to state court. 
    We did not try to restrain the state court from proceeding, and the Davenports appeared and they testified about their inability to pay, and the state court judge found that there was inability to pay, denied the motion to revoke probation, and the probationary period expired. 
    There was... there was no interference with the state court system here.

    Mr. David A. Searles 
    I think it has to do with the purposes of Chapter 13, which is, instead of liquidating your property and distributing the non-exempt assets to your creditors, which is what you do in 7, a 13 is a means to keep property and pay your creditors to the extent that you are able to. 
    So it's a broader discharge in a Chapter 13 because the result in most cases is going to be that all the debtor's disposable income is going to committed to the plan and paid to the creditors. 
    And to the extent that the creditors don't get 100 percent, well, Congress has made a decision that debts are not going to hang over the debtors head ad infinitum and at that point they receive a discharge. 
    So what Congress has done is provide for a broader discharge in some Chapter 13 cases, the ones that are completed under 1328(a), and provide for a discharge of all debts listed with two exceptions. 
    One of them being long-term debts and the other being alimony and support. 
    But all the 5... the other 523(a) exceptions in Chapter 7 were not... were specifically not incorporated into 1328(a).

    Mr. David A. Searles 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2023.936" stopTime="2032.676">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What are... what are the advantages for a debtor of taking Chapter 7 over Chapter 13?
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2032.676" stopTime="2049.721">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    A debtor who perhaps didn't have... couldn't meet the eligibility requirements of Chapter 13, who didn't have regular income, or who had more debts than he can have under Chapter 13, might be forced to liquidate rather than to reorganize.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2049.721" stopTime="2057.659">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But I take it the requirement for regular income is not terribly demanding under Chapter 13, if Social Security alone is enough.
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2057.659" stopTime="2066.931">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    It has to be regular. 
    But it also has to be enough to pay the claims that are filed in accordance with the priority scheme set up by the... by the court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2066.931" stopTime="2071.301">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But it would be enough... I take it it was deemed enough in this case to pay 10 percent?
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2071.301" stopTime="2125.119">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    It was deemed enough... I'm not sure what the percentage was, but yes, it was deemed enough. 
    The trustee reviewed the plan, recommended confirmation of the court, and the court confirmed. 
    No creditor came into court to object and both the Petitioners in this case had prior notice of the bankruptcy well before the confirmation deadline for objecting. 
    They didn't file proofs of claim and they did not object. 
    Our main contention is that it... restitution is a right to payment under the Code because there is a state court order requiring the Davenports to pay the money and the state order is pursuant to a state court statute mandating repayment in these kinds of cases. 
    The state court judge had no flexibility in imposing a sentence. 
    He had to order restitution in these kinds of cases and the restitution is enforceable through contempt proceedings or in some states, by civil actions. 
    And under any common sense reading of the term, the relationship between the parties here is one that created a right to payment on behalf of the petitioners.

speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2137.695" stopTime="2249.969">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    That's correct. 
    Besides the definition of claim in Section 101, there are two other sections of the Code which treat restitution as a debt. 
    One is 523(a)(7), which refers to debts that are fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which represents Congress' codification of the pre-Code judicial exception to dischargeability of criminal and civil penalties. 
    Congress has now upheld that those exception... Congress has... excuse me... written the law in a way that preserves those exception to discharge in Chapter 7, Chapter 12, some Chapter 11 and some Chapter 13 cases. 
    So the fact that they acted expressly to protect those debts in some cases but not others indicates that they did consider them debts. 
    And, as I said, that they incorporated those exceptions in 13 for some kinds of debts but not others, including fine, penalty and forfeiture, that also indicates that it was a debt. 
    Another section of the code, which is 726, provides for distribution of the property of the estate in payment of fines, penalties, and forfeitures. 
    The same phrase from 523(a)(7). 
    And also fines, penalties, and forfeitures was the title heading of a chapter in the crimes code at the time the Bankruptcy Code was enacted, which is another indication that Congress meant to include criminal penalties as well. 
    By providing for distribution on fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which wasn't the case under the Act... because these kinds of claims were not allowable, were not entitled to share in the distribution of the estate... Congress has shown it's intention that these are debts that should be paid. 
    And there's very good reason for including them in distribution, because if they weren't included, the entire estate could be liquidated and distributed without any payment to the restitution victim. 
    And this, we submit, would not make any sense because in some cases that distribution might represent the victim's best chance of recovering any money.

    But... as between the pre-Code situation and the post-Code situation, the state and the restitution victim I take it would prefer the pre-Code situation were... it was not... it was not includible or allowable, but is also dischargeable. 
    You just didn't touch it. 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2270.198" stopTime="2273.150">
    Mr. David A. Searles

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Yeah, you may well be right as to that's what Congress has said. 
    But certainly it's not any advantage to the potential recipient of restitution to have had that done.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Yes. 
    And that may well be Congress' decision. 
    My only point is it should not be painted as a benefit to the recipient of restitution as opposed to the pre-Code situation.
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2323.500" stopTime="2365.327">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    Well, I think it represents Congress' intent that all creditors share equally. 
    Just because you have a restitution order shouldn't give you preferential treatment over other possible victims of crimes or serious torts who have not obtained restitution orders. 
    If fines and penalties were not included in distribution, this would set up a conflict between the federal courts and the state courts over the administration of the debtor's assets. 
    And by giving bankruptcy court sole jurisdiction over the debtor's estate in Section 1334(d) of Title 28 Congress has expressed its intention that it's the federal... for the bankruptcy court, a single forum, that administers the debtor's affairs.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2365.327" stopTime="2374.100">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Was there a great deal of conflict during the 80 years of the previous regime, from 1898 to 1978?
speaker="david_a_searles" startTime="2374.100" stopTime="2489.325">
    Mr. David A. Searles 
    I'm not aware of any cases discusses that, but it appears to me that there could have been conflict because the debtor's estate was being distributed without the holder of the penalty or forfeiture claim getting any money-- 
    Finally, if you look outside the bankruptcy law, at the Federal Crimes Code, there is a section in there that shows that Congress obviously intended criminal fines to be debts, which is Section 3613(f) of Title 18 which was amended in 1984 to make federal criminal fines nondischargeable in any bankruptcy. 
    There would be no point in Congress writing that exception unless they thought fines were debts in the first place. 
    And when Congress did take this step to accept federal criminal fines, it did not do so for state criminal fines. 
    The Petitioners throughout the case have raised policy concerns which they believe support the notion that restitution should not be considered a debt. 
    What they fail to focus on is that their concerns are already met and already addressed in Chapter 13. 
    Chapter 13 is basically a new system for consumer debt and it's singular in its approach. 
    Unlike old Chapter 13, or Chapter 11, a debtor can now reorganize his affairs as long as he meets certain guidelines set forth in the Code. 
    He no longer needs affirmative voting approval from his creditors. 
    What Congress has done in Chapter 13 has been to balance the rights of the debtor and the creditors, and to establish guidelines that are designed to ensure that the creditors get fair and equal treatment. 
    They suggest that Chapter 13 can be used as a vehicle for criminals to escape the consequences of their act. 
    And this is simply not the case. 
    Many criminal defendants would not be eligible for Chapter 13. 
    There is a ceiling on the amount of debt you can have to be eligible. 
    And defendants who have been assessed large penalties for convictions for insider trading or toxic torts, or defrauding savings and loans, they will not be eligible to use Chapter 13.

    It's $100,000 of unsecured debt. 
    Anyone penalized above that would not be eligible for Chapter 13. 
    In addition, a debtor must have regular income and the bankruptcy filing must be in good faith. 
    And bankruptcy courts have not hesitated to dismiss bankruptcies or deny confirmations of plans where they felt the circumstances warranted it. 
    Beyond the restrictions on debtors, Congress has given a number of rights to creditors to assure that they can demand and assure that a debtor cannot use a 13 to avoid debts which he can't afford to pay. 
    The creditors can come into court, scrutinize the debtor's income and expenses, demand that all disposable income is being paid into the plan. 
    They can demand to receive at least as much as they would receive in Chapter 7 liquidation, and they can object to confirmation if they feel that the plan isn't paying them what they are entitled to. 
    In other words Chapter 13 has already provided Petitioners here with all--

    Mr. David A. Searles 
    Assuming the plan is a confirmable plan. 
    If there are problems with the plan, they are entitled to object and bring that to the attention to of the court. 
    The Petitioners in this case did not... chose not to exercise any of these rights that Congress has given them. 
    But if their argument is accepted and restitution is declared to be something other than a debt, the result is going to frustrate fundamental bankruptcy policy because it's going to result in preferential treatment for some creditors over others. 
    Including, as I said before, perhaps other victims of crimes or serious torts who had not obtained restitution orders and who, in some people's eyes, may have more sympathetic claims. 
    It would also result in a conflict between the state court system and the federal court or the administration of the debtor's property where Congress has already expressed its intention that that property be administered through a single forum, which is the bankruptcy court.

    Mr. David A. Searles 
    Now they can. 
    That's correct. 
    And also throughout the case what Petitioners have argued is that how Chapter 13 unduly interferes with state court proceedings. 
    But as I was explaining before, the... that... the fallacy of that argument is proved by the facts of this case. 
    While the bankruptcy was pending, the state was free to file a motion to revoke probation, which they did. 
    There was not effort to restrain the state court from proceeding. 
    The Davenports voluntarily appeared there and testified on the issue, which was whether they had the ability to pay, whether they had violated probation. 
    The state court judge, completely unimpeded by the federal court, denied the motion to revoke probation, decided that the Davenports had done what they were suppose to have done under the law. 
    Probation expired. 
    The state judge's power to rule is completely unaffected by the bankruptcy and in most cases, if the Third Circuit's ruling is... is affirmed, that is not going... the result is not going to affect the powers of state court judges. 
    And the reason that there is no undue interference in state court proceedings is that the underlying goal of the 13 and the restitution is substantially similar, which is that the debtor pay the restitution order to the best of his ability. 
    That is what the Davenports intended to do through their bankruptcy and the state court judge found nothing to the contrary. 
    In conclusion, what I want to emphasize is that treating restitution as a debt is consistent with the plain language of the code and with federal bankruptcy policy that a debtor deal with all his legal obligations in one form and that the creditors receive equal treatment. 
    Congress has designed Chapter 13 in such a way that the legitimate rights of creditors are protected and they have the tools necessary to protect their interests if they choose to utilize them. 
    Although Petitioners expressed fear of interference in state court proceedings, that fear is just not justified. 
    To the extent that there is any tension between the two court systems, that arises from the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution as implemented by the Code. 
    If there is a difference balance to be struck, it's up to the Legislature to decide that and not to the Judiciary. 
    We request that the decision below be affirmed. 
    Thank you.

    No, the claim was listed in the plan, but the state... and I think that that indicates the state prosecutors have a order of a court and we believe it would be unseemly for the prosecutor to have to go in to enforce a criminal court judge's sentence in bankruptcy court.
