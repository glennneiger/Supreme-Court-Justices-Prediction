    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    These cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Five individual petitioners, each received substantial severance payments from the Boeing Company, which is also a petitioner in one case, before leaving their jobs at Boeing to take jobs at the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. 
    The government brought an action seeking to recover the amount of the payments against the employee and Boeing alleging violations of criminal statute 18 U.S.C. Section 209(a) which forbids a private party to pay and a government employee to receive any supplemental compensation for the employee’s government service. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that Section 209(a) does not apply to a severance payment made before a payee becomes a government employee. 
    A literal reading of the statute’s text, as well as application of the rule of lenity support our conclusion that a recipient’s status as a government employee is an element of a Section 209(a) violation. 
    The judgment is accordingly reversed. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice O’Connor and Justice Kennedy have joined.
