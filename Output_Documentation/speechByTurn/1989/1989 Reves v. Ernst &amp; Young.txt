    Justice Marshall 
    In this case, we hold that certain promissory notes payable on demand and securities within the meaning of this Securities Act of 1934. 
    The Act’s exclusion for certain short-term notes does not apply in this type of case. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; the Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice White, Justice O’Connor, and Justice Scalia have joined.
