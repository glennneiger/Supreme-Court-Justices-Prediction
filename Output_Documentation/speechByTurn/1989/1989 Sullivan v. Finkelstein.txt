    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case raises an important question of the appealability of the district court decisions. 
    It is a question of importance not only in the administration of the Social Security Act, but over a wide range of administrative, rule making and adjudicatory activity. 
    Although this Court has never addressed this question in an administrative setting before, the question has been considered in that setting for some four decades by every court of appeals, and the vast majority of the court of appeals' decisions support appealability in the context that it is presented in this case. 
    In addition, in very analogous situations this Court has addressed the question of appealability in the exercise of its own jurisdiction. 
    And in those contexts, appealability has been upheld explicitly in the review of state court decisions under Section 1257 and implicitly in the review of court of appeals' decisions under the Hobbs Administrative Review Act, Section 2350, as in the famous Vermont Yankee decision.

    Does that section require a final judgment?
speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="100.882" stopTime="109.102">
    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Yes, it does, Your Honor, with the exception of decisions granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, the... the regular section providing for appeal... certiorari to this Court from the Federal courts of appeals does not require a final--
speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="116.791" stopTime="284.051">
    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The respondent argues in answer to our argument that the court under the Hobbs Administrative Review Act not only has jurisdiction to review final judgments under 2350 but also has general jurisdiction under 1254. 
    We believe that's clearly not so from the structure and language of 2350. 
    2350 indeed specifically adds to this Court's jurisdiction the ability to review a certified question under 1254. 
    We do not believe that 2350 contemplates a general authority to this Court to review a judgment of a court of appeals before or after judgment. 
    What it does is it puts this Court in a relationship to the court of appeals, which is the entry court of the Federal system in a situation that is very analogous to the ordinary relationship between a court of appeals and a district court. 
    Indeed, for this Court to grant certiorari before judgment we believe would be an exercise of original jurisdiction in violation of Article 3. 
    This particular case that arises before this Court involves a claim for survivor's disability benefits by the respondent. 
    When that claim was finally denied at the administrative level, the respondent sought judiciary review in a Federal district court. 
    The Federal district court held that the Secretary has made an error of law in relying solely on the listing of the impairments in the Secretary's regulations. 
    The district court then decided that since there had been no individualized determination of Respondent's residual functional capacity to do gainful work, the matter had to go back to the administrative agency for further proceedings. 
    At that point, the Secretary sought review in the court of appeals, and the court of appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
    After rehearing en banc had been denied by the court of appeals over three dissents, the case was brought here for a review. 
    The sole question before this Court on certiorari is the appealability of the district court's decision. 
    We submit, in accordance with those courts... on the majority of those courts that have reviewed on the problem below, that this decision is appealable, and we believe its appealability may be upheld on either of two alternative grounds.

    --At the agency, I think in this case, as agencies I think do in all cases, they regard themselves, and I think quite properly, as governed by the terms of the remand. 
    So that the agency never has contemplated the possibility.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    That... that has been our position consistently. 
    And, indeed, that is not a position that the Third Circuit questioned at all. 
    The Third Circuit was following a line a little bit like that of Justice Stevens, although not quite. 
    I think the Third Circuit said that what might happen is that the claimant would lose on remand because she would be found to have residual functional capacity. 
    She might then go to court and win and at that point the Secretary could appeal. 
    But I think the Third Circuit assumed, as we have argued, that if the case goes back on remand and findings are made in her favor with respect to her residual functional capacity, then the Secretary is not in a position to return to court for judicial review.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    With respect to Sullivan against Hudson, Your Honor, which is relied thereon very heavily by the respondent, we believe that case has to be understood as a case which is quite clearly directed to the problem of finality under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 
    Indeed, in Sullivan and Hudson the Court specifically said that its holding with respect to the definition of a civil action and with respect to the definition of finality was addressed to EAJA. 
    And, indeed, EAJA contains its own definition of final judgment. 
    EAJA says a final judgment is a judgment that is not subject to appeal. 
    The concept of finality under EAJA is intimately tied to the concept of who is a prevailing party. 
    And this Court that has held that for EAJA purposes a claimant is not a prevailing party until her claim has been fully resolved. 
    So, for that purpose the Court held that the court... the district court does retain jurisdiction, that the judgment is not truly final until the case has come to an end after remand.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    --The remand? 
    Well, the fourth sentence says with or without remand. 
    The fourth sentence refers to the possibility of a remand. 
    But, Your Honor, it really is not critical to our position, because, in the first place, we are not seeking to appeal the remand order as such. 
    And, in the second place, in response to Justice O'Connor's question even a sixth sentence remand, in our view, is not appealable by the Secretary if the remand results in a judgment for the claimant, because the seventh sentence of 405(g) specifically limits review to the review that could be given to an original determination. 
    And as I indicated earlier, the Secretary has no authority to appeal an original determination in favor of a claimant. 
    So, even if this... even if this case involves a sixth sentence remand, we don't believe that affects the ultimate outcome on the issue of finality. 
    And, as we explained in our reply brief and in our original brief, we don't think it's a sixth sentence remand in any event because it is not a remand either at the instance of the Secretary or because there is new material evidence.

    I think the same proceedings would follow. 
    Indeed, we suggested in our opening brief that what is now frequently done in the form of remand was historically done in an action for mandamus or injunction. 
    And the fact that the... that the disposition now takes the form of a remand does not, in our view, affect the finality of the judgment. 
    Historically, it seems to be remand finds its origins in the kinds of actions you're describing, actions for mandamus or actions for injunctive relief, that clearly come to an end.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And our position is that this case... our position we believe is buttressed by 405(g). 
    But it's also buttressed by the history of judicial review of administrative actions even before the APA. 
    And it's buttressed by the APA itself. 
    We would be here, I think, making exactly the same argument if this were an action under the APA and if 405(g) were not there. 
    We think 405(g) supports our position, but we don't believe it's essential to that position. 
    I would like, if I may, to address some other aspects of what I have described as our narrower argument for appealability. 
    That is, the argument that is based on the practical considerations of finality that were first articulated by this Court in Cohen against Beneficial Loan and since in a series of cases, including Coopers and Lybrand. 
    As I indicated at the outset, we agree with the vast majority of the courts of appeal--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1306.502" stopTime="1318.492">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is this... is this argument, Mr. Shapiro, also the one that is... is analogous to our handling of appeals from state courts in the treatment of finality there, or is this an alternate to that argument?
speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="1318.492" stopTime="1533.483">
    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    --I believe that it, in truth, it's quite analogous. 
    That is, to take a case, for example, like ASARCO, which was decided last term, or like Mercantile Bank against Lagdo, which was decided some years ago, these cases involved review of state court decisions in which a state court had finally adjudicated some Federal question. 
    And then the state supreme court had remanded it to the lower courts for further proceedings. 
    It was possible, of course, that when the case came back to the state supreme court, it might reconsider the Federal question it had passed on before. 
    But the state supreme court, as far as it was concerned, had disposed of that Federal question. 
    And so this Court in these cases... Lagdo and these other cases... held that for purposes of the final judgment requirement of 1257 the underlying purposes of finality had been met. 
    Our argument here is comparable to that and, indeed, it seems to us that the Cohen doctrine is a recognition of the applicability of that line of reasoning in the context of court of appeals review of district court decisions. 
    The particular requirements of the Cohen doctrine we believe are all met here. 
    Indeed, we don't think there can be much argument about some of them. 
    For example, we think it's clear that the district court was not in its own mind making a tentative decision about the error of law that the Secretary had committed. 
    The decision was, in the judge's mind, a conclusive one. 
    With respect to the second Cohen criterion, Respondent vigorously contests our argument that it does apply... the criterion that the decision in whose review is sought be separable from the merits. 
    We think it is undoubtedly true, indeed, as it was true, I think, in some other context like Mitchell and Forsythe... we think it is undoubtedly true that the error of law that we believe the district court made is an error that goes to the merits of the respondent's claim for benefits. 
    But the rationale of that separability requirement we believe is fully met here. 
    As we understand the Court's discussion of that requirement, it is designed to prevent courts of appeals from interfering unduly with the ongoing process of trying the case. 
    The trial court judge has a special role to fulfill, and premature consideration would interfere with that role. 
    Moreover, the Court recognizes, I think, that where the question is not separable from the merits, that what happens in the later stages may affect the view of the question for which review is now sought. 
    We believe that neither of those factors exists here. 
    In this case, the case is no longer in the trial court at all; there is no problem of interfering with the trial court's ongoing discretion; and, as I tried to indicate an answer to Justice Stevens earlier, I think the administrative agency properly views itself as bound by what the district court did. 
    So that nothing that happens on remand can affect the nature of the question on which review is sought.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Again, Your Honor, I believe that depends on which branch of our argument is accepted. 
    If you accept our narrower approach that this is appealable under the Cohen doctrine, then I think under this Court's decisions, for example, Corey and the United States, the government would have the option of reserving the point for later appeal, if a fortuitous series of events made that possible. 
    If the Court accepts our broader argument that this is final in the truest sense... the sense that I think I was suggesting in response to Justice Scalia... then I believe that the time for appeal would have expired and the only question would be whether there is issue preclusion in a later action. 
    And I suspect that there very well might be.

   Argument of Kenneth V. Handal
speaker="kenneth_v_handal" startTime="1633.213" stopTime="1732.662">
    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Your Honor, I want to make one thing clear here. 
    The Secretary's original theory in this case was stated in his petition and in his opening brief. 
    He asked the Court to hold that a remand order under Section 405(g) was appealable as a final decision. 
    In his reply brief and... and now the Secretary has... has stated basically a new theory that he should be able to appeal a legal issue that accompanies a remand order in an Social Security case while the case is still within the jurisdiction of the district court. 
    Not only is that idea of appealing a legal issue pretty much unprecedented in... in the Court's finality jurisprudence, but, as we point out in our brief, the Secretary has no need for this overall and... and no need for it in the context of this particular case. 
    And most importantly, Mr. Shapiro says that Section 405(g) is not necessary to his case. 
    The problem with that is that what is being proposed to be done here under Section 405(g) is totally contrary to the statutory scheme that... that is laid out there. 
    And... and this Court last term in Sullivan v. Hudson dealt quite extensively with the statutory scheme under Section 405(g). 
    And I'll get to that. 
    The... the Secretary's new theory about appealing a legal issue here, Mr. Shapiro said that... that it is--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1732.662" stopTime="1735.547">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is that the Cohen v. Beneficial Loan theory?
speaker="kenneth_v_handal" startTime="1735.547" stopTime="1817.416">
    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    --Well, not so much, Your Honor. 
    As the theory is set out in the reply brief and I believe that what Mr. Shapiro is suggesting here is simply that he can peel off the legal issue from this remand order and separate this situation out... the remand order... into two separate proceedings and thereby appeal the legal issue while the remand proceedings go back to the... to the agency. 
    He says that very clearly at page 19 of his reply brief. 
    Mr. Shapiro added that... that the vast majority of the court of appeals' decisions support the government's theory here. 
    There were... the courts of appeals were probably evenly split over the old theory that he should be able to appeal the remand order. 
    There is not a court of appeals' decision cited by the Secretary, and none that we can find, that supports the Secretary's new theory about peeling off this legal issue and... and appealing just the legal issue. 
    And we think clearly it's contrary to this Court's decisions, and we particularly note Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion in the Liberty Mutual case in 1976 which--

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Yes, Your Honor, and there's been no judgment entered so far in this case. 
    All the district court did was enter an order of remand, and that's something that happens quite often under this statute. 
    50 percent of all cases disposed of by district courts under this statute are remands. 
    And... and last year there were 5,000 remands alone. 
    It happens all the time.

 Take a case, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, one of the landmark cases in administrative law which involved a rule making that was challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act, under the residual review provision of the APA. 
 That is, it was a suit brought for declaratory and injunctive relief. 
 The district court held that the FDA's rule went beyond its authority. 
 It was appealed to the Third Circuit and it was appealed all the way up here.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    --Your Honor, first of all, I'd note that in Califano v. Sanders, this Court held that there is very limited review under... under... under the APA for Social Security cases. 
    The statute we're dealing here is a very different animal, as this Court pointed out in Hudson. 
    It's a very, quote, unusual statute and we're not looking to the APA here. 
    Secondly, as provided in the statute in this case, Mrs. Finkelstein went to the district court seeking review of her denial of benefits, and that is specifically provided for under this statute. 
    She didn't seek declaratory relief. 
    She didn't seek injunctive relief. 
    She didn't try to invalidate any regulations. 
    And a reading of the district court's opinion and the court of appeals' opinion here clearly indicates that they didn't think any regulations were invalidated. 
    And then I go on to my further point that under SSA's policy this case has no further reach than Mrs. Finkelstein's benefits. 
    It's not going to be applied by SSA anywhere else. 
    This... this is a very peculiar statute and... and... it's... it's one that allows the district court to retain jurisdiction of the case.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    --Your Honor, the Court said that for one thing in the Hudson case that is was, quote, an unusual statute... in that it took the district courts out of their ordinary role as, quote, administrative overseers and made them ground level participants in the administrative process. 
    These cases go back and forth between the district court and the agency all the time. 
    The... the statute is... is unusual in that in, for example, in the fourth sentence it... it gave the court the power to modify the agency decision. 
    The district court here, if it had wanted to, could simply have set Mrs. Finkelstein's benefits and... and then remanded the case for payment or for certification.

    Your Honor, we... we set forth in our brief a discussion of the state of the law actually in 1939 when this statute was passed. 
    And the... the cases cited there indicated that when courts reviewed administrative actions they were pretty much limited to affirming or reversing the action, not to get really involved in the rate making or the setting of rates or whatever.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Your Honor, we have that same situation here. 
    That the... automatically under this statute the case is sent back to the agency and the court retains jurisdiction. 
    The Secretary has agreed in this case that the sixth sentence does say it's appropriate for him to go back to the district court after the proceedings on remand. 
    In Hudson he conceded that he... that the district court retained jurisdiction and that he was required to do that, and so this Court held.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The... clearly what we're most concerned with here is the second part of the sixth sentence which describes the remand mechanism and, as the Court said in Hudson, that mechanism applies to all remands, and it applied to the remand in that case. 
    The first part of the sixth sentence clearly where it says, 
    "and it may at anytime order additional evidence to be taken. " 
    that clearly applies to... to all remands. 
    And as Justice Stevens said, it certainly can be read as applying to this remand in this case, according to the district court's opinion.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Perhaps, Your Honor. 
    But the way this statute has been interpreted, the second clause of that sentence refers to at any time ordering additional evidence to be taken. 
    In fact, Justice Blackmun, 20 years ago, in an opinion, Bohms v. Gardner on the Eighth Circuit, described all the different ways in which a district court might remand under that second clause. 
    I'm not sure that that's so important. 
    I think that the... the important thing here, though, is... is the... the mechanism that comes after the semicolon in this sentence that indicates that the parties shall... that the district court shall retain jurisdiction.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Although the courts don't ordinarily reverse. 
    They simply remand the case, and that's what happened here. 
    In response to something that Justice White asked which is... is about how... how the Secretary could get appeal of the substantive issue in this case, I wanted to mention that the Secretary does have a number of ways in this case to get this issue considered. 
    What could happen is that after the proceedings on remand, the claimant may not be satisfied with... with what happened at the remand proceedings and the claimant can return to the district court. 
    The district court could then enter a final judgment, and the Secretary may be able to... it can then appeal all of the issues, including the issues from the remand order. 
    That's precisely what happened in the Second Circuit in October in Kier v. Sullivan when the Secretary had this specific issue that he's concerned about here decided after a final decision.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    Your Honor, this whole idea of whether there is a remand under sentence six or sentence four is... is a phony issue. 
    It was an issue that the Secretary came up with when he was saying that he wanted to appeal from the remand order. 
    He... he interpreted the statute as though there were remands under sentence six and remands under sentence four. 
    There aren't.

    Well, let me just change the facts very slightly and see what your answer is. 
    Supposing the district judge... and I... it's a little ambiguous to me... had not said take additional evidence. 
    The district judge simply had said, make a factual finding on this particular issue that I regard as critical as a matter of law on the basis of the evidence already in the record, and that was done. 
    Would the Secretary then have power to review? 
    Could that... the sixth... sixth clearly would not apply then. 
    Six only applies when you take more evidence.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

    And in... what the Solicitor General is suggesting is that the fourth sentence applies to legal error remands and the sixth sentence applies to fact remands.

    Mr. Kenneth V. Handal 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, in... in... also in the Hudson case, it was an improper application of the vocational guidelines. 
    That's why the case was remanded in that case, and the court indicated that the remand mechanism applied to that case. 
    Just two other points, Your Honor. 
    On the collateral order doctrine, it's interesting that the Secretary refers to Cohen rather than this Court's decision in 1978 in Coopers and Lybrand and the decisions since that which have seriously narrowed the application of that doctrine. 
    We don't think that at least two of the requirements there are met. 
    And... and the... we think that this is not an important issue in the context of important issues as this Court has determined that. 
    This issue is not completely separate from the merits. 
    It's just a purely legal issue apart from Mrs. Finkelstein's benefits. 
    And also for the reasons we've pointed out, this district court order is not effectively unreviewable later on. 
    The Secretary can appeal it. 
    The Claimant can appeal it. 
    And the Secretary in the last six months has gotten consideration and decision of the First Circuit and the Second Circuit on the substantive issue he purported to appeal here. 
    And he's gotten consideration in the Fourth and the Tenth Circuits.

    --that language is at page 2255 and the court said... quote... 
    "as in this case, there will often be no final judgment in a claimant's civil action for judicial review until the administrative proceedings on remand are complete. " 
    The court cites a Fourth Circuit decision in 1983 and then quotes from it that the procedures set forth in 42 U.S.C., Section 405(g), contemplates additional action both by the Secretary and a district court before a civil action is concluded following a remand. 
    The Secretary concedes that a remand order from a district court to the agency is not a final determination of the civil action and that the district court retains jurisdiction to review any determination rendered on remand. 
    And that's in the words of the sixth sentence.

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The respondent, we submit, is grossly overreading the Hudson decision and in doing so is making an argument that would allow the EAJA tail to wag a very large dog, is doing so in a way which we submit is flatly inconsistent with the language in Section 405(g) and is not in the interest of claimants at all. 
    The Secretary's position is that if a decision is rendered for the claimant on remand, it is necessary to file the necessary... the papers in court in order that a determination of fees may be made under EAJA. 
    The Secretary believes that there is no right on his part to obtain judicial review of a decision--

    Mr. David L. Shapiro 
    Not only that, but I think the position he's taking is not in the interest of claimants because he is suggesting a much broader ability of the Secretary to obtain review of a decision in favor of the claimant than the Secretary believes he has under the Act. 
    Moreover, I think it clearly is in the interest of claimants to allow an appeal at this stage because if the court of appeals agrees with the district court and upholds the district court's decision that will establish the law of the circuit. 
    And the Secretary's acquiescence policy will then be that either the Secretary will seek further review in this Court or will acquiesce in the Third Circuit's decision and all future decisions will be governed by that holding. 
    Thank you.
