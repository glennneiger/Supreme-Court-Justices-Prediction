    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 88-1897, the Michigan Department of State Police v. Rick Sitz. 
    Mr. Casey.
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="10.522" stopTime="89.605">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In a series of cases involving Fourth Amendment challenges to various traffic-checking procedures, the Court has applied a balancing test which weighs the public interest against the right of individuals to be free from arbitrary interference. 
    In these cases, the Court recognized that different procedures involve different balances and different constitutional safeguards. 
    For example, probable cause is required for a search of a vehicle either by a roving patrol or at a fixed checkpoint. 
    A seizure of an automobile by a roving patrol is permissible if it is based on reasonable suspicion, and in Martinez-Fuerte the Court held that seizure of an automobile at a fixed checkpoint is permissible without individualized suspicion if there are neutral and objective guidelines which limit the discretion of officers in the field and limit the nature of the intrusion. 
    The case today presents no new legal issues. 
    The only question is whether Michigan's temporary sobriety checkpoints are like the roving patrols in Delaware v. Prouse or, as we argue, are more like the fixed checkpoints in Martinez-Fuerte in which no individualized suspicion is required.

speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="123.245" stopTime="156.265">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    --The case was brought under the Michigan declaratory judgment action by the plaintiffs in their capacity as licensed drivers in the State of Michigan who allege that if sobriety checkpoints were operated there was a very great likelihood that they would be subject to the checkpoints. 
    We agree. 
    If the checkpoints were operated, these individual plaintiffs would be subjected to them. 
    We think there is a sufficient case or controversy to confer standing in both the state courts and in this Court, even without waiting for a particular operation of the checkpoint.

    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    So far we are, yes, Your Honor. 
    [Laughter] 
    There is no dispute as to the operation of the Michigan checkpoints. 
    They were intended to promote the public health and safety by reducing the appalling number of deaths and injuries and the staggering economic costs caused by alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
    The committee which drafted the Michigan guidelines observed that in 1984 in Michigan alone there were 800 deaths, more than 28,000 injuries and more than $350 million in economic costs caused by alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
    The sobriety checkpoints are intended to increase the public's awareness of the nature and severity of the problem of drunk driving. 
    They are intended to apprehend people who are driving drunk at the time and to deter others from driving drunk in the future. 
    The sobriety checkpoints use neutral, objective criteria which were carefully designed to minimize the discretion of the officers in the field and to minimize the extent of the intrusion. 
    All oncoming traffic in the selected location is alerted by way of an extensive series of signs, flares, lights, traffic cones, officers with reflective vests. 
    Traffic is funneled into one lane of traffic. 
    The drivers are stopped for between 20 and 30 seconds while a police officer approaches the driver, identifies himself or herself, explains the nature of the checkpoint and hands the driver an informational brochure and a public opinion survey card which the driver is requested to return. 
    If there are no visible signs of intoxication, the driver is then free to go on his or her way. 
    If the officer observes articulable signs of intoxication, he may direct the driver over to a safe area for further investigation.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="333.529" stopTime="342.901">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, when you're stopped by a police officer, aren't you normally very nervous if you're perfectly sober?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="342.901" stopTime="370.785">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    Not necessarily. 
    Some people might be nervous. 
    Others might feel reassured by the fact that this is going on. 
    In the Maryland study which our committee relied on and examined very closely, public opinion survey cards were returned by the drivers who went through the Maryland survey, and I believe the figure was 87 percent of the cards which were returned indicated that they were not opposed to the checkpoints, and 90 percent of them felt that there was some deterrent effect.

    Not necessarily. 
    Some drivers may feel that. 
    We don't think that that's the determining factor in whether these are constitutional, however. 
    There's a legitimate and very serious societal problem here, and to some extent these are an intrusion on the motoring public, to be sure, but we submit that they were very carefully designed to be a very minimal intrusion. 
    And when you weigh that in the balance of the serious nature of the problem, we submit they are reasonable.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="401.654" stopTime="409.658">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does Michigan use any kind of checkpoints for vehicle safety check requirements?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="409.658" stopTime="424.818">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    That type of checkpoint is authorized by the same statute which authorizes sobriety checkpoints, and my understanding is that such checkpoints have been operated on occasion in the past but there is no standard procedure. 
    They're not operated very frequently.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="424.818" stopTime="445.414">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What if there were a situation in a particular area, for example, in the City of Detroit, with high crime and a great many shootings. 
    Do you suppose that Michigan could set up a pedestrian checkpoint and frisk people for weapons?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="445.414" stopTime="486.474">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    I doubt if they could frisk them. 
    You'd get into the case of Terry v. Ohio on when a police officer can pat down a person on the street. 
    What we're saying here is that the checkpoints are located at times and in places where there is a demonstrated history of alcohol-related crashes. 
    All accident statistics are fed into a computer, and the checkpoints are placed in locations where there has been a history of accidents or high arrest rate. 
    In that instance, the same type of balancing test would apply. 
    You would have to look to the nature of the severity of the problem, the amount of the intrusion, and does the police procedure reasonably... have reasonable effectiveness in addressing the problem.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="486.474" stopTime="495.164">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Are the same standards applicable to a vehicle safety inspection stop and a sobriety checkpoint, same balance?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="495.164" stopTime="496.449">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    I believe they are.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="496.449" stopTime="498.349">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Same legal standards, same rules?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="498.349" stopTime="626.231">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    Correct. 
    The purpose is a little different, but the Court has recognized in Delaware v. Prouse, for example, that the state... pardon me... the state has a very significant interest in assuring that drivers are properly licensed and have proof of insurance and registration and that vehicles have the required safety equipment. 
    The nature of the problem here is even more serious than that. 
    We're talking about hundreds of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries every year. 
    In Brown v. Texas, the Court applied a balancing test and discussed several of the traffic-checking cases. 
    In all the parties below in state courts, we use the Brown v. Texas articulation as the standard. 
    There, the court identified three factors which go into weighing whether a particular procedure is reasonable or not: the gravity of the public concern, the extent to which the seizure advances the public interest and the severity of the interference with individual liberty. 
    We believe that the record in our case is sufficient to demonstrate that the checkpoints are reasonable under all three of these factors. 
    The gravity of the public concern is undisputed by plaintiffs here. 
    It's widely recognized. 
    The key point where the state courts went wrong, we submit, is in its conclusion that the checkpoints were not effective enough. 
    The court in Michigan said that we did not prove a sufficiently high arrest rate, we did not prove long-term deterrent effects from the operation of the checkpoints and we did not prove that they were the most effective method the police could use. 
    We submit that the state courts severely distorted the appropriate balancing test when they held us to that kind of impossible burden. 
    We think that in this context where you have a very serious public problem and minimal intrusion, all that the... all that needs to be shown is reasonable effectiveness. 
    Is there sufficient basis for the state officials reasonably to conclude that sobriety checkpoints would be reasonably effective in addressing the drunk driving problem.

speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="635.253" stopTime="647.276">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    That's correct. 
    In several cases the court has articulated standards in dealing with the effectiveness of various procedures. 
    In Delaware v. Prouse--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="647.276" stopTime="655.548">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Casey, when you say... when you say this is a seizure, you mean it's a... it's... it's like an arrest or it's like a Terry stop?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="655.548" stopTime="683.651">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    --It is less intrusive than a traditional arrest. 
    The cars are required to stop for a period of 20 to 30 seconds at the checkpoint. 
    All cars coming through in a certain direction are required to stop. 
    In Michigan our checkpoint guidelines are set up so that cars can turn off before they enter the check lane, and on the one checkpoint which was operated, I believe the record shows that six cars either made U-turns or turned off before they entered the checkpoint.

speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="684.717" stopTime="693.840">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    The checkpoint guidelines were developed with every effort to minimize the intrusion, and that I suspect was one element of the effort.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    So, you want to let the drunks get away?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="694.840" stopTime="711.818">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    It would be easy to design a more effective checkpoint than we have, but to do that would probably require a greater intrusion. 
    The balance that the Michigan officials chose was to give as much weight as possible to minimizing the amount of intrusion.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="711.818" stopTime="716.372">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Would the U-turn provide probable... articulate suspicion for a stop?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="716.372" stopTime="769.757">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    Not by itself. 
    If the U-turn was done in a fashion that violated traffic laws or if there was some erratic driving or some other articulable suspicion, then the guidelines say that that would be enough to pursue the driver. 
    But just the mere fact of a lawful U-turn would not be enough. 
    Under the Martinez-Fuerte case the court said that all cars coming through the checkpoint could be seized and the officers running the checkpoint could direct some cars to another area for further investigation without any reasonable suspicion. 
    Our checkpoint is even more protective of individual rights than that. 
    The officers do not ask any questions. 
    Drivers are not required to show identification. 
    There is really no communication from the driver required at all unless there are some visible signs of intoxication, at which point the car would be directed to a safe area.

    You can't--
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="779.129" stopTime="817.135">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    There are many ways a trained police officer could take notice of articulable facts involving intoxication: uncoordinated physical movements, eye motion. 
    Perhaps he's got some beer in the car with him. 
    There are many ways. 
    Our checkpoints require an officer, before they have further suspicion, to have articulable signs of intoxication. 
    I believe the Constitution perhaps does not require even that high a standard. 
    In Martinez-Fuerte the court said that some cars could be directed for further inquiry without reasonable suspicion.

    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    It could be one of the factors. 
    In several cases... in the Ortiz case, for example, this court discussed the idea that a trained police officer can observe behavior which might appear innocent to an untrained person and from that behavior the trained officer can make inferences and deductions which would form a basis for reasonable suspicion. 
    That's why it's so hard to say that any one factor would or would not be the deciding factor. 
    There are command officers on the scene who are involved in the decision whether to send a driver off for further investigation. 
    It's not up to the individual officer in the field, and it is structured by the guidelines themselves.

    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    There are several police cars to be stationed before and after the checkpoint, so a car could turn and follow a car that made a lawful U-turn, yes.

    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    We join in Mr. Casey's analysis of the legal principles that govern this case, but if the Court please, I will focus first on those features of the problem of drunk driving in this country that have made it so resistant to traditional law enforcement techniques and on some of the reasons why sobriety checkpoints have been widely recognized as the important elements of effective drunk driving programs. 
    Mr. Casey indicated there has been no dispute in this case that the problem of drinking and driving is a very serious one. 
    It is important, nevertheless, to pause for purposes of the Court's balancing test and to appreciate just how grave that interest is. 
    If one were to prepare a list of the most important and serious threats to public health and safety in this country, drunk driving would have to be at or near the top of the list. 
    In 1988, 47,000 people were killed in traffic crashes in this country. 
    Of the roughly 62,000 drivers involved, 25 percent were intoxicated legally at the time of the accident.

    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    You Honor, a frisk is a much more intrusive form of interference with 4th Amendment interests than a traffic stop. 
    A traffic stop is a well-accepted form of intrusion. 
    In the Martinez-Fuerte case the Court noted that it was a well-established practice. 
    Its utility had been accepted as an incident of travel on the roads, and it is a very, very minimal interference with Fourth Amendment interests.

    The government cannot insist that you have a license to walk along the sidewalk, can it?

    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    No, Your Honor, I wouldn't think so.

    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    That's true, driving is a very highly regulated activity in this country, in keeping with the risk that it presents to others on the road.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So it's not inconceivable that you might have a traffic stop not just for intoxication, but for drug use. 
    Does this to seek to find out the drug use as well, this program, or is it just alcohol?

speaker="stephen_l_nightingale" startTime="1276.195" stopTime="1324.258">
    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    I would think not, Justice Scalia, in this sense: in a number of the Court's cases you have had to assess, necessarily, the deterrent effect of various programs. 
    In the Mackey v. Montran case, which involved whether drivers could have their licenses suspended for refusals to take breathalyzer or blood alcohol test, the Court indicated that they had a significant deterrent effect. 
    In the Burger case, there was discussion about the deterrent value that would be lost if warrants were required for the sorts of searches that were involved there. 
    And it is a common element of the Court's decisions in this area, both to consider the deterrent effect of programs and all other--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1324.258" stopTime="1339.350">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but have we done it in cases when the trial court has reviewed evidence on the issue and their record has been developed? 
    Have we said, well, that's just a starting point, we'll go off on our own and figure out what evidence we can find on our own? 
    I know we've done it in cases of a facial attack and no evidence at all on the trial record, but--
speaker="stephen_l_nightingale" startTime="1339.350" stopTime="1355.193">
    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    --Well, I think it's important to focus on the sort of trial record that was developed here. 
    This is not a record that gauges the effect of this particular program in action. 
    This is a record that focuses on the potential of the program.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1355.193" stopTime="1365.466">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Whatever the record was is what the state put in in order to justify the program. 
    They had an ample opportunity to put everything in they wanted, didn't they? 
    Maybe you could have tried the case better, but you didn't try this case.
speaker="stephen_l_nightingale" startTime="1365.466" stopTime="1407.162">
    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    That's true, Your Honor... not necessarily true that I could have tried it better, but it's certainly true the state had an opportunity to put in the evidence. 
    The issue really is... I think the approach the Court must take in this area results from the generality of the Court's holdings. 
    I mean, were the Court to take this situation... were the Court to say that this presents only an issue of fact, the effect of the Court's decision would be limited to these two parties as of this time, and the Court has never viewed its role in the Fourth Amendment area as limited. 
    So--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1407.162" stopTime="1411.797">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    We never viewed our role as just deciding the case or controversy that's brought to us for decision, I suppose.
speaker="stephen_l_nightingale" startTime="1411.797" stopTime="1426.306">
    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale 
    --Well, that's certainly true, but I think in this case the question is whether there is a reasonable basis for a conclusion on the part of the state authorities that this is a potentially effective means of reducing drinking and driving.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1426.306" stopTime="1453.539">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is that all it takes, a reasonable basis in order to make the weighing of whether this is a reasonable intrusion of privacy or not? 
    Suppose I disagree with the state. 
    Suppose I think... it seems to me, if you took these 17 law enforcement officers, however many were used in this stop, and just set them out on the roads to look for people weaving, you would do a lot more good than having sit at this traffic stop for a number of hours and... what did they pick up, 2 percent of the people that went through?

    Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale

    Thank you, Mr. Nightingale. 
    Mr. Granzotto, we'll hear from you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Mark Granzotto
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1611.753" stopTime="1694.489">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    There are two reasons why the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed. 
    The first is based on this Court's decision last term in Von Raab, and also in the Court's decision in Skinner. 
    In that case... in those two cases, this Court indicated the situations under which the Court would refer to the balancing test in determining whether a particular Fourth Amendment intrusion was in fact unconstitutional. 
    In Von Raab and Skinner, this Court indicated that where the particular type of intrusion serves law enforcement needs... or, excuse me... serves governmental needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement, then the Court would refer to a balancing test. 
    This case presents, for the first time, I believe, in this Court, a situation in which a suspicionless, warrantless seizure is being conducted solely for one purpose. 
    And that is to enforce the criminal laws. 
    Under the decisions of this Court's last term, in Skinner and Von Raab, this Court need not even refer to the balancing test, in light of the fact that there is no dispute that the reason this particular seizure takes place is to in fact enforce the criminal law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1694.489" stopTime="1696.306">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How about Martinez-Fuerte?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1696.306" stopTime="1714.200">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    Martinez-Fuerte... Justice Powell, in his decision in that case, in a footnote, indicated that many of the seizures which take place in a... at the border search or at the border stops, resulted in something which did not go to a formal charge. 
    But, in fact--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1714.200" stopTime="1716.736">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it was... it was enforcing the criminal law, nonetheless?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1716.736" stopTime="1757.044">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    --That's correct. 
    That's correct. 
    Martinez-Fuerte was of course a criminal case. 
    But to go back to Almeida-Sanchez, three years before Martinez-Fuerte, Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion in that case, indicated that only 3 percent of all cars that were stopped... or, excuse me... of all persons who were stopped for violations of... of the border... illegal aliens, only 3 percent of those people were in fact prosecuted. 
    Therefore, we have a situation which is just like New York v. Burger in that, indeed, it's... there's an overwhelming noncriminal purpose to the stops which took place in Martinez-Fuerte.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1757.044" stopTime="1767.352">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, to... to say that they're... end up not being prosecuted doesn't mean they weren't being used to enforce the criminal law. 
    That was the only law on the books there was that was being enforced, wasn't it?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1767.352" stopTime="1771.304">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    But... but it wasn't being enforced through means of a prosecution was the point.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why does that make any difference?

speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1789.397" stopTime="1810.395">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    Yes. 
    They did, in fact. 
    Because in the Von Raab case, for example, there was no... there was... there was no chance of there ever being a criminal prosecution in light of the fact that these... the testing which took place in Von Raab couldn't be used unless by the agreement of the person whose test was being taken in a criminal proceeding.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1810.395" stopTime="1823.286">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but, I thought the point you were making was that Martinez-Fuerte was really not a criminal case, because so few people were prosecuted under it?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1823.286" stopTime="1847.603">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    No, that's not what I'm saying. 
    This Court has decided in New York v. Burger that a... a particular type of scheme can have both... both an administrative nature and a criminal nature. 
    Martinez-Fuerte fit squarely within the dichotomy which was drawn in this Court in New York v. Burger, because, as Justice Powell indicated, only 3 percent of these cases actually result in prosecution.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1847.603" stopTime="1858.042">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but that doesn't mean it's an admitted... an administrative scheme. 
    It's not as if there was some administrative procedure that was being enforced in Martinez-Fuerte. 
    It was just different levels of the criminal process.
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1858.042" stopTime="1898.952">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    Well, I would... in... in response to your original question, Mr. Chief Justice, I would also indicate to the Court that this Court has indicated since Martinez-Fuerte that there is... there is a... a nexus to the border... the border which allowed the Court to make the decision in Martinez-Fuerte as it did. 
    And that's the case of Montoya de Hernandez. 
    Because, in that case, the Court indicated that the decision in Martinez-Fuerte was, in fact, connected to this... this country's vested right to protect its borders. 
    And in that sense, the whole concept of a probable cause or reasonable suspicion requirement was automatically out of the Martinez-Fuerte case to begin with.

    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    To some extent, those cases may fell... fall within the balancing test, even under this Court's decision in Von Raab and Skinner, because they may involve, in particular states certainly, noncriminal prosecutions, or at least a situation in which there is both an administrative aspect--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1932.006" stopTime="1939.176">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well... well, okay, I'll make up one. 
    It's criminal. 
    If... if... if they catch your truck with too much weight on it, you're going to be cited criminally, or with unsafe brakes.
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="1939.176" stopTime="1955.704">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    --Well, there's another construct to the Fourth Amendment which may come into play in the situation of a truck and a weigh station, and that is the heavily regulated industry concept which has been developed by the Court and applied in a number of cases. 
    That may well take it outside--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1955.704" stopTime="1962.792">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Heavily regulated industry... I don't know.

    Mr. Mark Granzotto

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me circular.

    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    --No. 
    The heavily regulated industry construct, which this Court has adopted, is based on one... one thing. 
    And that is, a piece of legislation or a number of pieces of legislation. 
    The weigh stations have nothing to do with whether it is in fact a heavily regulated industry.

    These particular stops in Michigan have, in fact, been decriminalized recently, as Colonel Hough testified in his testimony at the trial in this case.

    And the Maryland program had been in existence for approximately four years. 
    In addition, there was a considerable amount of experience outside the United States prior to the Maryland program, which analyzed these... the effectiveness of these sobriety roadblocks. 
    And that's the... that is the type of evidence which was presented in this case through Dr. Ross. 
    Now Dr. Ross, who has analyzed extensively the studies that have been conducted worldwide on the... on the subject of sobriety roadblocks, testified in this case.

    Mr. Granzotto, would it have made a difference if these weren't stops along the way, but if these were... suppose they set up at the... at the entrance to... to Michigan highways? 
    Checkpoints at which they would check your car headlights before you were allowed on it, the brakes and... and the sobriety of the driver? 
    Or suppose they do it at a toll booth on a state... on a state toll road? 
    When you come up to the toll booth they check your... the safety of the car and the safety of the driver, is that okay?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="2178.028" stopTime="2197.107">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    Well, my position is that, with respect to a... an investigation and attempting to find criminal wrongdoing, that there is something fundamentally different about that, and a stop for... a for vehicle code violation or... or a toll booth.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2197.107" stopTime="2216.799">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it's hard to separate the one from the other. 
    I mean, it's the same at the truck stops. 
    They're doing two things. 
    If you are there in violation of the law, you'll be penalized. 
    But they want to get you off the road, also. 
    Isn't that the purpose of these stops? 
    I mean you say it has a purely criminal purpose. 
    Well, it isn't just to... to put you in jail for a violation; it's to get you off the road because you're drunk. 
    Isn't that a separate--
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="2216.799" stopTime="2219.085">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    But the purpose is achieved through the enforcement of the criminal law.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2219.085" stopTime="2233.575">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, likewise, in the case I just spoke about, when they're checking you to get on the road. 
    You... you mean it would be okay if they check your brakes and found the brakes were no good and said, you can't get on the road, go in peace, and you go home?

    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    No.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2234.260" stopTime="2236.610">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But if they arrest you for bad brakes, then it becomes bad?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="2236.610" stopTime="2324.584">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    No. 
    The first that you are describing is something that would... certainly, in Michigan, in light of the decriminalization... be subject to the balancing test. 
    The point... the only point I would raise in light of Von Raab and Skinner is that, if... if the purpose of the intrusion is to purely serve the criminal law, then that... that intrusion is unconstitutional without even a resort to the balancing test. 
    Let me go to the balancing test, which has been talked about at length. 
    There... there are three factors which were analyzed in this case. 
    The gravity of the public harm is the first. 
    And on that we have no dispute. 
    We did not bring this case to minimize the dangers associated with drunk driving in this country. 
    What we attempted to prove and did, in fact, prove to the satisfaction of the trial court in this case was that sobriety roadblocks are just not an effective means of addressing that serious societal problem. 
    We presented in this case the testimony of Dr. Ross. 
    Dr. Ross is a preeminent expert in the area of deterring the drunk driver. 
    What Dr. Ross testified to on one point was totally uncontradicted at trial. 
    And that was that as a means of actually arresting drunk drivers, sobriety roadblocks are worthless. 
    Sobriety roadblocks do not achieve significant numbers of arrests.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2324.584" stopTime="2330.055">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How did he define significant and how did he define worthless?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="2330.055" stopTime="2357.455">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    It's not exactly defined, but what Dr. Ross I believe was talking about when we was talking about worthless is that you are taking, you are removing a number of officers from a practice which does have positive effect, and that is roving patrols. 
    You are taking officers away from that, that goal, and applying them in a particular area to conduct these sobriety roadblocks.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2357.455" stopTime="2378.619">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, so the... the... if the state feels differently, if the state after evaluating its enforcement proceedings feels that the roving patrols don't do the job and that this checkpoint should at least be given a try, they're not entitled to do that if some expert takes the stand and says it... it... I think differently.

    We... we have a situation where the state comes into court acknowledging, although not before this Court, I might add, since they've altered their position dramatically before this Court, but they came into court saying that these... this program is not designed to perfect arrests because it really won't be that effective in perfecting arrests. 
    But we want this... we want this program because it's going to deter.

    In Michigan I would suggest to you, Justice White, that this program was done despite the hesitancy of the Michigan legislature. 
    It was done at the request of the Governor of the state of Michigan. 
    And in my estimation, it was done precisely because this... this type of law enforcement mechanism is visible.

    And in that sense, Mr. Justice White, we may have a situation where there is the... the end result of the court's decision in this case may be far more important to the law enforcement people in this country than any decision... any indication, let me say, that these sobriety roadblocks actually work in this country.

speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="2955.216" stopTime="3137.199">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    No. 
    It is not only... let me say it is not only that it is the less effective way, let me say, than... than roving patrols. 
    That's not the only point. 
    The fact is that these types of seizures will result in a limited number of arrests, first of all. 
    They're not going to accomplish what they want to accomplish. 
    It's not... it just not going to serve the purpose in comparison, I will grant you, in comparison to what the police could be doing in other settings. 
    But as this court found in Delaware v. Prouse there is a sort of marginal utility, if you will, to the... a police technique which has to be analyzed by this Court. 
    In Delaware versus Prouse, for example, the court found that these types of stops which were at issue in that case weren't going to result in a marginal increase in the... in the problem, the crime problem which the police were attempting to combat in that situation. 
    The same is true in this case. 
    The third prong which I would like to address of the Court's balancing test concerns the scope of the intrusion, and on this point I think there's a couple of misconceptions regarding the position which the State has taken in this case. 
    The State attempts to justify this program on the basis that this is a minimal intrusion for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. 
    In... in fact, there are a number of other factors related to the intrusion which impact on... on the analysis which this Court must apply in the balancing test. 
    First of all, there is the... the point which has been made before with respect to the number of innocent drivers passing through these checkpoints. 
    At... at its best, these checkpoints allow 99 percent of the cars to go through because these people are innocent of any wrongdoing. 
    In addition, there is another disquieting, I believe, aspect to these sobriety roadblocks which has come out in the evidence in this case, and that is there is a significant number of what I would call false positives which have been developed. 
    In other words, the program works that people will go through a... go through these sobriety roadblocks, be stopped temporarily... that is, the stop which the... which the State represents as being very short in duration. 
    In actuality, a number of people will be diverted to another area where they will be further investigated, including a number of tests. 
    What the evidence from other sobriety roadblocks has indicated is that you have twice as great a possibility of being diverted to these... for this further investigation and not being drunk than you have of being drunk when you're diverted to these--

    So... so of those diverted, one-third are found to be drunk and two-thirds are released?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="3144.020" stopTime="3214.883">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    --That's correct, after further investigation, obviously, and more... obviously more extensive investigation that's been... that takes place. 
    There are... as well, there is a point made by the... the State in this case with respect to the discretion which is allotted the people who conduct these patrols. 
    The State argues that that discretion limits the scope of the intrusion which is involved in the case. 
    We had testimony in this case from Inspector Fladseth of the State Police who indicated that when a person approaches this sobriety roadblock, that person can be diverted for further investigation for any reason or for no reason at all; therefore, the answer that was supplied before with respect to failing to open the window, if somebody could be diverted for further investigation for failing to open the window, the answer to that question is yes, they can be, because Inspector Fladseth candidly acknowledged during the course of his testimony that the officer who is... who is confronting the person driving up in the car can divert that person for further investigation, more extensive investigation, for any reason, or for no reason.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If... if only 1 percent of drunk driving is... are arrested in this manner and one-third of those diverted are found to be drunk, only 3 percent then are diverted; is that about right?
speaker="mark_granzotto" startTime="3226.589" stopTime="3322.118">
    Mr. Mark Granzotto 
    That's correct. 
    I... I am also concerned and... about the scope of the intrusion which can take place in these sobriety roadblocks, because if this Court does in fact approve sobriety roadblocks, the stop itself, there are a number of necessary results which would obtain on the basis of prior decisions of this Court, on the basis of Pennsylvania v. Mimms and on the basis of Brown v. Texas. 
    There are a number of actions, conduct which the police can take in this situation, undeniably, if this Court does in fact approve sobriety roadblocks; that is, the stop itself. 
    We brought this case not in attempt... not in an attempt to demonstrate that drunk driving is not a serious societal problem in this country. 
    What we attempted to show in this case, what in fact the trial court did adopt in this case, was that sobriety roadblocks are not an effective means of combatting that serious societal problem. 
    Under the balancing test, therefore, what we have, I believe, is a serious problem. 
    We have a... an intrusion which may be minimal in some respects, but it is an intrusion which does not accomplish anything. 
    And on that basis we would ask that under... under the Court's balancing test as it's been adopted that these sobriety roadblocks be found unconstitutional. 
    Thank you.

    I have nothing further to add, Your Honor.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Casey, excuse me. 
    I do have a question. 
    Do you agree with the statement that was just made that these parties at the roadblock could be pulled over for further investigation for any reason or for no reason? 
    Was that the way this was done?
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="3347.234" stopTime="3349.720">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    No, I don't agree with that. 
    The testimony that he's referring to--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3349.720" stopTime="3368.383">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because that... that bears upon the scope of intrusion. 
    I had thought up to now that all we're talking about the degree of intrusion is being stopped. 
    If what... if that statement is true, the degree of intrusion without articulable suspicion could be as much as getting out of your car and having to walk a line and do all the other tests that they perform.
speaker="thomas_l_casey" startTime="3368.383" stopTime="3407.524">
    Mr. Thomas L. Casey 
    --That statement is not accurate. 
    One... in one sentence in a deposition, one of the deputies on a cross-examination said that there could be reliance on any number of factors or perhaps no factor. 
    That's not what the law says. 
    That's not what this Court's cases say. 
    That's not what our guidelines say. 
    That's not the law in Michigan. 
    If a driver is pulled over for further investigation for no reason whatsoever, they would be able to challenge that on an individual as-applied basis. 
    Under the guidelines and the way the Michigan program is set up, drivers cannot be diverted for further questioning unless there are visible, articulable signs of intoxication.
