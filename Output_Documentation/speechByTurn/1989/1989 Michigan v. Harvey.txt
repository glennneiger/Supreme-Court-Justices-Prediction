Michigan v. Harvey

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-512, Michigan v. Tyris Lemont Harvey. 
    Mr. Baughman.
speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="10.298" stopTime="120.513">
    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court today is whether an accused may be cross-examined with the statement taken subsequent to the assertion of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel as that right has been construed in Michigan v. Jackson. 
    I wish to present for the Court's consideration this morning two principal points. 
    The first is that exclusion of evidence for impeachment purposes is an inappropriate remedy for violation of a prophylactic rule, and that Jackson is such a rule. 
    But, secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, that exclusion of evidence for impeachment purposes is also inappropriate for violation of the Sixth Amendment as it relates to custodial interrogation. 
    The facts, very briefly put, in this case are these. 
    The victim in this case testified that respondent raped and beat her, causing three fractures to her left eye socket. 
    Respondent, on the other hand, testified that the episode was essentially an agreement to exchange sex for cocaine gone wrong, and that the blows that he struck were in self-defense. 
    The prosecutor questioned respondent about a statement that he had made after arraignment and assertion of the right to counsel. 
    That statement came to be taken when respondent told the police officer that he wished to make another statement. 
    But he then also said that he didn't know whether or not he should talk to his attorney. 
    The officer stated that that would not be necessary, as his attorney would be supplied a copy of any statement that he might make. 
    The assistant prosecutor stated that it was because of this colloquy between respondent and the attorney that she did not believe that the statement was admissible in the case in chief. 
    However, she did argue that it was admissible for impeachment purposes, arguing that it was not involuntary.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    Well, the Sixth Amendment to me does not suggest on its face any necessary role for counsel at interrogation prior to the attachment of the right. 
    In the first portion of my brief I attempted to argue or to make the point that there is at least some theoretical question as to the underpinning of the entire doctrine of counsel even having a role at this stage. 
    I'm not planning to argue that point today, but all I wish to suggest there is that there is an argument to be made that perhaps this court has taken the doctrine of the right to counsel at impeachment as far as it ought to go so that it should not extend it to impeachment use. 
    What I am suggesting here with the first portion of my argument as to the prophylactic rule is simply that Jackson is a prophylactic rule in terms of guarding the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that there hasn't been a finding in this case by any court that the respondent didn't otherwise validly waive his right to counsel. 
    The issue was never litigated in this case.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And the Michigan Court of Appeals relied on Jackson for its holding?
speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="435.503" stopTime="498.913">
    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    Yes, it did. 
    On appeal what the Michigan Court of Appeals stated was that the... and I quote... that the statement was made in violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, see, e.g., Michigan v. Jackson. 
    A statement so acquired may not be used for any purpose, including impeachment. 
    And that was the extent of the court of appeals analysis in this case. 
    That court made no independent inquiry as to whether there had been an otherwise valid waiver of the right to counsel, and there was no need for it to do so because in Jackson this Court had held that any waiver of the right to counsel occurring after its assertion and occurring at police-initiated interrogation is simply invalid. 
    There is no need for further inquiry. 
    That case, Michigan v. Jackson, was premised on Edwards v. Arizona and imported directly the Edwards rule that when an accused asserts his Miranda counsel right to cut off questioning, any waiver occurring subsequently at police-initiated interrogation is simply invalid without any further inquiry into the manner in which that waiver might have occurred.

    I'm sure the police were undoubtedly aware of that. 
    I can't say this individual officer was that he said he wanted to talk to. 
    But that's... when he said, 
    "But I don't know if I should talk to my lawyer. "

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    Well, no. 
    I think if the Michigan Supreme Court or Court of Appeals had said this case is reversed because we find as a matter of state law that a violation of the cannons precludes use of the evidence for any purpose, then I think the case would have been decided on a state law basis and we wouldn't have a federal ground to go on. 
    This Court has recognized that the in the Edwards context that the court there was not dealing with a constitutional rule. 
    In Solem v. Sterns this Court said, in declining to afford Edwards' retroactive effect that the court in Edwards had created a protective umbrella serving to enhance the constitutional guarantee and referred to the rule in Edwards as a prophylactic rule. 
    The court stated that Edwards established a bright-line rule to safeguard preexisting rights, not a new substantive requirement. 
    So, is it possible to violate a protective rule to, as it were, pierce the protective umbrella, without violating the underlying constitutional principle that the protective rule or umbrella was designed to protect? 
    And I think this Court has answered that question in the affirmative on more than one occasion. 
    For example, in Miranda this Court has held time and again that the Miranda warnings themselves are not constitutional rights but are prophylactic rules designed to protect the underlying constitutional right, that of a compelled self-incrimination.

    I think your Honor is correct, and I see your point. 
    I'm tending to confuse the Sixth and the Fifth Amendments. 
    I think that if error occurred in the constitutional sense, whether it be a prophylactic rule or the underlying right, it would have to occur at questioning. 
    The admission of the evidence is the question of whether or not any remedy springs or not. 
    If it's not admitted, no remedy springs. 
    If it is, then there is a litigable point.

 That (a) it's a constitutional violation to engage in this kind of questioning when the man is represented by counsel, and (b) it's a constitutional violation to introduce it at trial. 
 You seemed to think the second was the case just very naturally.

    --Michigan v. Jackson states that if the individual has asserted his right to counsel, the police simply may not initiate any questioning with him unless he goes forward first, which is the precise rule of Edwards transposed from the Fifth Amendment into the Sixth Amendment. 
    The rule of Edwards is that if the individual exercises his Miranda counsel right, he can't be interrogated again unless he initiates. 
    It's the same rule from the Fifth into the Sixth. 
    And this Court has said in the Edwards context that that's a prophylactic rule designed to protect voluntaryness.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    --Well, let me try to make it clear. 
    The violation that occurred in this case occurred at the time of the questioning is what I'm now conceding to Justice O'Connor. 
    But I'm not conceding that that was a violation of the Sixth Amendment because that question has really never been litigated. 
    All that was decided was that Jackson was violated. 
    And what I'm arguing to this Court today in the first portion of my argument is that Jackson establishes a prophylactic rule to protect waivers of counsel so that if an individual has asserted his right to counsel, you just can't question him at all. 
    But I think that it is certainly conceivable and possible that if the police do initiate interrogation after the assertion of the right to counsel and we examined all the surrounding facts, that one could say as a matter of actual fact that a voluntary and intelligent and knowing waiver of the right to counsel has occurred. 
    If that can occur, if it is possible to actually voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel, when the police initiate the interrogation, then the rule prohibiting that must be a prophylactic rule designed to protect, insure and enhance that guarantee, just as in the Edwards context it seeks to protect.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    --Again, if he validly and intelligently and knowingly waived his right to counsel, I don't think the Sixth Amendment would be violated and it would turn on the facts of each case. 
    Initiating the contact at all would violate Jackson, but it's possible that after that initiation he may meet a Johnson v. Zerbst standard, or any other standard, for waiver. 
    In this case, that was never litigated because below the respondent or defense counsel at trial, who was not Mr. Morgan, did not object to the use of this statement for impeachment purposes and, therefore, there was never any record developed as to what happened in terms of any warning, how the defendant came to speak. 
    That was never fully explored because all that mattered was... to the Michigan Court of Appeals... was that Jackson was violated because they treated this as a police-initiated interrogation.

    And they ruled that notwithstanding the failure to object to its use in the trial court, they would reach it and reverse the conviction.
speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="1056.723" stopTime="1088.666">
    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    That's correct. 
    The Michigan Court of Appeals did three things. 
    They forgave the failure to object; they found a Jackson violation and said that a Jackson violative statement cannot be used for impeachment; and they held that this was not harmless error. 
    Now, I think as to one in three, as to forgiving the failure to object and a finding of a lack of harmless error, that the court erred egregiously. 
    But they held what they held. 
    And because they held in the way they held, we are here on the second issue with a rather scant record because the issue was never developed in the trial court due to the failure to object.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    Oh, no. 
    None whatsoever. 
    As I've said, the first part of my argument was simply that this Court should not find that exclusion of evidence for impeachment purposes is required when a prophylactic rule has been violated, and I tried to urge that Jackson is such a rule. 
    But, more fundamentally, if this Court were to determine that what happened here was a violation of the Sixth Amendment as well, we would also urge that this Court not call that exclusion of the evidence for impeachment is required. 
    This Court has considered the question of impeachment use of evidence when it has been obtained in violation of a constitutional principle rather than a prophylactic rule with regard to two amendments, the Fourth and the Fifth. 
    And this Court has reached different conclusions with regard to the remedy, depending on which amendment is involved, and we submit for good reason. 
    With the Fifth Amendment this Court has held that statements which are compelled are admissible for no purpose whatsoever. 
    Even those cases allowing impeachment use of evidence obtained in violation of one of the Miranda prophylactic rules recognized if those statements are also compelled and therefore taken in violation of the Fifth Amendment and not simply the prophylactic rule, that no use may be made of those statements.

    Not that there couldn't be a waver, but was there a waiver.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    That's correct. 
    I think that's true. 
    This Court could have said in Massiah or Brewer, or other cases, that the police approach rendered anything that was voluntary or was impermissible, and you would not have gotten into the splits in the court in those cases as to whether or not the waiver had occurred. 
    They would have been very easy cases to decide, I believe. 
    In Portash this Court held that the Fifth Amendment violation is admissible for no purpose whatsoever and that that principle did not turn on whether or not the statement might be reliable because there the compulsion was a judicial order rather than physical force. 
    But in reversing the lower court, this court said that the linchpin of the Fifth Amendment is not reliability, it's coercion. 
    So, any coerce statements by a governmental agent simply cannot be used for any purpose whatsoever because, as Justice Stewart put it, in that case the court was dealing with the constitutional privilege in its most pristine form. 
    That's what the Fifth Amendment is for. 
    It's to exclude an evidence from evidence a class of testimonial evidence, compelled statements. 
    That's why it exists. 
    But with the Fourth Amendment, as contrasted to the Fifth, this Court has reached a different result. 
    This Court has held that when that right is violated, rather than a prophylactic rule designed to protect it... and I'm unaware of any, frankly... that use of evidence for impeachment purposes illegally seized under the Fourth Amendment is permissible. 
    Beginning 35 years ago in Walder, this Court has consistently held to that proposition, recognizing that arriving at the truth is the fundamental goal of our system of justice and that full cross-examination is, as Wigmore has said, the greatest legal engine ever invented.

    and then said,

    that that should not be treated as initiated by the defendant. 
    That his remark turned it into an initiated interrogation by the police because of his rather ambiguous remark about counsel. 
    The trial prosecutor conceded that's why she wouldn't use it in her case in chief. 
    And I'm not disputing here that this should not be treated as the police... that it should be treated as police-initiated interrogation.

    --This Court faces the very same question in Haas. 
    In Haas what happened was the individual was given his Miranda right to counsel and asked for a lawyer. 
    And the police kept questioning and a statement was taken. 
    This Court said expressly, 
    "one might concede that when proper Miranda warnings have been given and the officer then continues his interrogation after the suspect asks for an attorney. " 
    which I submit is analogous to what your Honor is suggesting, 
    "the officer may be said to have little to lose and perhaps something to gain by way of uncovering possibly impeachment material. " 
    "This speculative possibility, however, is even greater where the warnings are defective and the defect is not known to the officer. " 
    "In any event, the balance was struck in Harris and we are not disposed to change it now. " 
    I would submit that the instant situation is really almost perfectly analogous to what happened in Haas.

    Mr. Timothy A. Baughman 
    That's true, but as to the deterrent effect on the police on exclusion of impeachment evidence, I believe the situations are analogous. 
    The police don't want to get evidence illegally. 
    They're not out there trying to violate all constitutional principles. 
    And there is a concern that they might get a statement that would be otherwise admissible and now they can't use it. 
    They might evidence which... a statement which they derive evidence from and they get into the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis. 
    The police aren't trying to violate the Constitution. 
    There is a good deterrence rationale on excluding it in the case in chief, and I think this Court's remarks in Haas that it's speculative as to whether there is an increased effect if you exclude it for impeachment use is valid here. 
    Haas was decided 15 years ago and I've seen nothing in the literature and nothing has been suggested in response to--

    --I think the deterrent principle as to whether or not there's any deterrence gained or it's significant enough to warrant the detraction from the truth-finding process that happens when you exclude the evidence for impeachment purposes is simply the same in this situation as it is in Haas. 
    Again, I see nothing to suggest that since Haas police routinely continued to interrogate people after they assert the Miranda right to counsel. 
    And it's been 15 years. 
    I suspect if one were to say that Haas had opened the floodgates to illegal police behavior, that we might have heard about it by now. 
    And I think that translates to the situation also where we would see the same sort of situation.

    There is no question the right had attached; respondent was formally charged. 
    There is no question that he asserted that right; he requested an attorney. 
    That attorney then stood as the medium, as this Court has indicated in Jackson, between the state and the respondent for all contacts. 
    There is no question, then, notwithstanding that medium, not withstanding that assertion of the right to counsel, the state interfered with that right. 
    The state interfered concededly, deliberately--

    I'm sorry, Justice. 
    At the time of the interference. 
    But I don't think that ends the analysis. 
    I think the next step is to look to see is there prejudice. 
    Or, in other words, did the state gain some advantage. 
    Did the state use it, and not just use it in the sense of, as the Solicitor General argued in the amicus brief, that, well, they only used it in essence to generate impeachment and that's not so bad. 
    Well, there are many uses. 
    The example of put respondent in the witness chair and ask him a few questions and size him up is a use which is to the state's advantage.

    --No, not on the record because the state also concedes... they concede the Sixth Amendment violation. 
    They concede a Miranda defective admonition. 
    And by virtue of that, then, I think implicitly there cannot be a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right. 
    But it is... a violation may occur at the time of interference by the state. 
    But it is then... the next step is prejudice. 
    Was there some use... did the state gain an advantage? 
    You could have a violation, no question... a Sixth Amendment violation but no prejudice to defendant, no use. 
    Weatherford v. Percy, albeit in a civil context, is an example. 
    Undercover officer acting under cover posing as a... as a defendant, intruding in the attorney-client relationship and intruding in the defense camp. 
    But, of course, the court said that certainly there was a violation. 
    But there was no prejudice because the officer never, never shared anything he learned with the prosecutor. 
    Consequently there was no prejudice, there was no use. 
    But there are many ways in which the state can engage in a Sixth Amendment violation here and gain an advantage or prejudice--

    Because the analogy to the Fourth Amendment is simply inappropriate. 
    The Fourth Amendment is a right that all citizens have. 
    It is not a procedural right, such as the Sixth Amendment. 
    It does not extend to the integrity of the trial process. 
    It does not encompass the essential components of the right to counsel, notions of trustworthiness, notions of reliability. 
    In the Fourth Amendment the harm is complete at the time that it's done. 
    It simply is an inappropriate analogy to a core violation of the Sixth Amendment.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    There should be no balancing at all, and that is our position. 
    That this is in the larger context... it's as much an adversarial proceeding in private as the trial may be. 
    It may be as critical or more critical than the trial. 
    The need for the presence of counsel is just as critical. 
    The state argues that, well, the rule of counsel in essence... it's... it's limited to the trial courtroom, it really doesn't come into play. 
    But, to borrow a phrase from a well-known Congressional investigation, the lawyer is not a potted plant. 
    The lawyer plays a role at that kind of interrogation. 
    The lawyer's role is to ensure that the questions are fairly stated. 
    More importantly, the lawyer's role is to ensure that the client comprehends the questions.

    Assuming Michigan v. Jackson is prophylactic, it's respondent's position that here there was not only a violation of the prophylactic rules conceded by the state but also a substantive violation of the Sixth Amendment itself. 
    And because there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment, we don't get into that balancing.

    That's correct.

    Mr. Morgan, you gave you a litany about what the lawyer's role is. 
    The lawyer's role is to do this and the lawyer's role is to do that. 
    I guess what this case involves is whether... at least the issue of whether it's a core Sixth Amendment violation... involves the issue of whether the lawyer's role is to assist the defendant in deciding whether he wants a lawyer. 
    And I don't think it necessary follows that just because the lawyer's role is to defend against all sorts of other things, it is also the lawyer's role to... necessarily the lawyer's role to assist the defendant in deciding whether he wants to waive his right to a lawyer. 
    One can certainly say that that's an entirely different question from other aspects of a lawyer's role.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    Well, that is the troubling contradiction that I fumbled badly previously. 
    And the contradiction is, I believe, the defendant who asserts the right implicitly, explicitly evidences his knowing decision that he is incapable to deal with the state. 
    After making that decision, which no one can contest as knowing and intelligent, it's troubling then to have the same defendant, if you will, who has already recognized that he is incapable of dealing with the state, go to the state, deal with the state, or, in this instance, subject himself to the guiding hand of police officers.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    I... I think the lawyer plays a role and ultimately the police don't decide waiver. 
    The court decides waiver. 
    And that's our position here... is, after assertion of the right to counsel there must be an exacting standard if we're going to get into the question of waiver... comparable. 
    In Faretta the court not only ascertained from the defendant that he knew what he was doing, that he wanted to do that. 
    The court not only ascertained and informed the defendant that there were detriments. 
    The court in Faretta actually... the trial judge actually went beyond that and said this is a real bad idea. 
    That's the kind of waiver that respondent submits... that's the kind of exacting waiver that respondent submits is the only permissible waiver of right to counsel after the defendant has asserted the right. 
    What the state seeks, frankly, is a license to interrogate the defendant here... it was six days before trial. 
    There is no restriction in the state's position. 
    So, if it's unsuccessful six days before trial, let them go five days, four days, three days, two days. 
    Let them go to the defendant during the trial itself. 
    There is absolutely no downside for the police.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    --In engaging in the offending interrogation, I would not attribute the motive of preventing perjury to the state, frankly. 
    The state is obviously engaging in something that, number one, generates impeachment material, number two, constitutes a form of discovery that they were not otherwise entitled to, number three, may actually undermine the integrity of the process and inhibit the truth-seeking. 
    For example, if in this context the police had taken Respondent Harvey's statement six days before trial, in violation of his right to counsel, and shared it with the complainant and the complainant then used it consciously or unconsciously to... to prepare herself for testimony, to perhaps consciously or unconsciously to shape her testimony, to steel herself for cross-examination, then this offending interrogation has actually undermined respondent's right of confrontation.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    Well, in this record it does not appear to be perjury. 
    It barely appears to be inconsistent. 
    But respondent's position in essence is that just as we do not permit a compelled involuntary statement, as in Portash, to be used for impeachment, we should not permit, in the name of truth-seeking, a statement taken in clear violation of the right to counsel. 
    That we do not simply engage in that kind of balancing, truth-seeking versus deterrence.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Part of the reason for the Fifth Amendment rule in cases like Portash has been a feeling on the part of the court, hasn't it, that compelled testimony has an element of unreliability to it?

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    I... I don't know if it was ever suggested, frankly, in Portash, who was compelled by virtue of an order to testify before a grand jury under oath.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    They are obviously distinguishable.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But hasn't... in the coerced confession cases part of the reasoning there has been that the coerced confession is deemed presumptively unreliable?

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3194.096" stopTime="3202.551">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And certainly that wouldn't be true in this case. 
    The circumstances attending the defendant's statement here would not lead to any presumption of unreliability.
speaker="robert_m_morgan" startTime="3202.551" stopTime="3256.057">
    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    I don't know if it would lead to a presumption of unreliability, but the record in this case implicates or raises a concern for unreliability. 
    For example, the three areas of impeachment. 
    One of the areas was, you didn't tell the police the name of this person whose name in essence is now uttered in your testimony. 
    "Yes, I did tell them. " 
    respondent testifies. 
    "Yes, I told them". 
    Not an answer that is patently perjurious. 
    Not an answer that is even contradicted in any fashion because the prosecutor never completes the impeachment process. 
    The prosecutor, instead, in this truth-seeking venture... adventure, as the state uses the term... insinuates, well, if it's not in there, that's the police that must have left it out.

speaker="robert_m_morgan" startTime="3264.823" stopTime="3337.044">
    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    But my point is, the presence of counsel at that interrogation might have ensured that when respondent told the officer the name, it got into the statement. 
    And that involves, I think, the area of reliability, certainly. 
    There really is no downside for the state... or, in this instance, the police... and the state concedes, certainly, that the police in this instance are acting as agents of the prosecutor. 
    There is no downside whatsoever to keep... to keep coming back at the defendant. 
    And, of course, those defendants that are already in the custody of the state... the state that confines them, that fees them, and so forth... are probably the most vulnerable. 
    And under the rule that the state seeks here, they seek a license to engage in that process not only repeatedly, not only as often as they like, but during the very trial process itself.

    Mr. Robert M. Morgan 
    --The confession, or statement, in your hypothet certainly may be no different than the involuntary compelled testimony of Portash. 
    But in order to preserve the right itself, we do not engage in that kind of balancing. 
    In order to prevent a violation of the Sixth Amendment itself, we don't engage in that kind of balancing. 
    The truth-seeking function versus deterrence. 
    In essence... in sum... it is respondent's position that there is no question in this case that his right to counsel was violated, that analogies or comparisons to the judicially crafted Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, or the judicially crafted prophylactic rules of Miranda, and the other outer layer of Edwards simply are inappropriate where there is a core violation of the amendment itself.

    Just a quick factual point. 
    We do not concede in this case that after the colloquy between the attorney and the police officer improper Miranda warnings were given. 
    What we concede is... because we conceded there... that that cannot be viewed as defendant-initiated interrogation. 
    What happened after in terms of any waiver or warnings just hasn't been litigated in this case, and I think that's the only question I think that's before this court factually.
