speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="49.450">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the other case, Teamsters and Helpers Local No. 391, we hold that an employee who seeks relief in the form of backpay for a union’s alleged breach of its duty of fair representation is entitled under the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial. 
    We therefore, affirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit. 
    Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part in 1, 2, 3B, and 4, and concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in all but part 3A and concurring in the judgment; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices O’Connor and Scalia have joined.
