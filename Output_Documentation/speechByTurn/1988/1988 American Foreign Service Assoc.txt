American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 87-2127, American Foreign Service Association versus Garfinkel. 
    In this case, the District Court invalidated Section 630 of an Act of Congress dealing with disclosure agreements by Executive Branch employees as an impermissible interference with the President’s authority to regulate the disclosure of national security information. 
    In a subsequent ruling, it held that the Executives’ use of the term "classifiable" was impermissibly vague and ordered the executive to discontinue use of this term. 
    In light of this development, a portion of appellant’s lawsuit is moot. 
    Other questions, however, may remain, and in their current posture of best resolved in the first instance by the District Court. 
    We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
