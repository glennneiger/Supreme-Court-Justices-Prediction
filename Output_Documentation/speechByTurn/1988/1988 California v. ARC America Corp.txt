    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on appeal from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    We reverse the judgment of that court. 
    The opinion and sum filed with the Clerk explains why. 
    The opinion is unanimous except the Justices Stevens and Oâ€™Connor who took no part in the case.
