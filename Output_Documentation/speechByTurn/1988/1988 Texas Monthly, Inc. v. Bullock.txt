    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now this case is here from the Court of Appeals of Texas. 
    The question we have to decide is whether a Texas exemption of a religious periodical from Texas sales taxes promotes religion in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. 
    From October 1984 until October 1987, a Texas "statute exempted from sales and use taxes periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith consisting holy writings promulgating the teachings of the faith and books consisting of holy writings sacred to a religious faith." 
    In 1985, the appellant, a publisher of a general interest magazine that was not entitled to the exemption page sales taxes under protest and sued to recover those payments in State Court. 
    Ruling that the statutes exclusive exemption for religious periodicals promoted religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. 
    The State Court struck down the tax as applied to non-religious periodicals and ordered the state to refund the tax paid by appellant plus interest. 
    The State Court of Appeals reversed holding that the exemption satisfied the tripartite test of our decision in Lemon v. Curtsman and therefore did not violate the Establishment Clause. 
    Our judgment reverses the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals and holds that the exemption does violate the Establishment Clause. 
    Our reversal is supported by three opinions, one by me joined by Justices Marshall and Stevens, another by Justice White, and the third by Justice Blackmun which is joined by Justice O'Connor. 
    Justice Scalia, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, has filed a dissenting opinion.
