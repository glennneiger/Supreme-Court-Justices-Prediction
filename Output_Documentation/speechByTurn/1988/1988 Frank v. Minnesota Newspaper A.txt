    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Frank versus Minnesota Newspaper Association. 
    The Minnesota Newspaper Association sued in Federal Court in Minnesota to prevent the Postmaster General from enforcing a federal statute which prohibited the mailing of any publication containing advertisements for lotteries or list of lottery prizes. 
    The District Court granted partial relief and both parties appealed to this court. 
    After we had noted jurisdiction over the appeals, Congress passed further legislation affecting the case. 
    The parties agreed between themselves to dismiss the Newspaper Associationâ€™s appeal. 
    And now, the Newspaper Association states its willingness to forego all relief that it sought by filing this suit. 
    In a Per Curiam opinion filed with the Clerk, we conclude that this stipulation renders the case moot. 
    We therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for the District Court to dismiss the portions of the complaint remaining at issue on this appeal. 
    Justices White and Marshall dissent and Justice Stevens has filed a separate dissent.
