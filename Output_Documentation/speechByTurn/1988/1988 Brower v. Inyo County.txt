    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit. 
    William James Caldwell, who is Brower was killed when a stolen car that he had been driving at high speeds at an effort to elude the police, crashed into a police roadblock. 
    His heirs, the petitioners here brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the roadblock amounted to excessive force and that respondents had therefore made an unreasonable seizure of Brower. 
    The allegations were that the roadblock had intentionally been set up just around the bend in the road at night with a police cruiser stationed with its high-beam headlights shinning in the eyes of the on-coming car, so that the crash would be inevitable. 
    The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a Fourth Amendment claim on the ground that the roadblock was reasonable under the circumstances. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed but on a different theory concluding simply that no seizure had taken place. 
    Because the police roadblock terminated Brower's movement through means intentionally applied, we conclude that a Fourth Amendment seizure did take place. 
    We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for consideration of whether the District Court erred in concluding that the roadblock was not unreasonable. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun joined.
