    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act does not preclude Iowa or any other states from including Outer Continental Shelf derived income in the unitary tax rate of an otherwise constitutionally permissible apportionment formula. 
    The Supreme Court of Iowa is hereby affirmed.
