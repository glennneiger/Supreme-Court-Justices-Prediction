Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Graham
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="32.209">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    No. 88-266, Oklahoma Tax Commission versus Jan Graham. 
    In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that an action originally brought by the Oklahoma Tax Commission against members of an Indian tribe to recover state sales taxes could properly removed be from State to Federal Court. 
    In an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we reverse the Court of Appeals concluding that under our well-pleaded complaint doctrine, as a spouse in a number of our cases, its holding was an error.
