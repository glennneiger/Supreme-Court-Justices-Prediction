    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1383, United States v. Irwin Halper. 
    Mr. Dreeben, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="22.886" stopTime="51.165">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case concerns the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the civil False Claims Act, Title 31 U.S.C. 3729. 
    The district court invoked the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar a recovery by the government of penalties under the False Claims Act from Appellee who had previously been criminally convicted of making the same false claims.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="51.165" stopTime="52.557">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And fined?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="52.557" stopTime="172.384">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Yes, Your Honor, he had been fined. 
    Appellee knowingly made 65 separate false claims under the Medicare program, each of which overcharged the government by $9. 
    The False Claims Act provides a $2,000 mandatory penalty at the time that this action was brought for each such false claim. 
    The government accordingly sought a penalty of $130,000 in this case. 
    The district court focused on the fact that Appellee's overpayment by the government was $585 from his 65 false claims. 
    It compared the penalty to the loss and determined that in the factual setting of this case, the sanction amounted to a criminal penalty that could not be imposed in view of Appellee's previous criminal conviction and punishment. 
    It therefore held the False Claims Act unconstitutional as applied to Appellee in this case. 
    We believe that the district court's analysis and conclusions are incorrect. 
    The False Claims Act has been on the books for 125 years. 
    It has been upheld before by this Court against a double jeopardy challenge very similar to the one accepted by the court below. 
    A statute very similar to the False Claims Act was upheld after that case in a similar double jeopardy challenge. 
    In the False Claims Act, Congress has provided a reasonable lump sum recovery for every false claim made on the government. 
    It is designed to cover reasonably anticipated losses in the average case. 
    It is also designed to compensate the government for the costs of investigation and prosecution, which can be extremely heavy in ferreting out, detecting and bringing wrongdoers to justice. 
    Finally, it serves the purpose of deterring wrongdoers from committing false claims such as the kind that Appellee committed. 
    It is not a criminal statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="172.384" stopTime="180.879">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Isn't there some sort of a volume discount, though? 
    I mean, if there are 65 claims investigated, it wouldn't cost as much as to investigate just one.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="180.879" stopTime="214.261">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    It... it may be true that in some cases the costs of investigation do not rise as rapidly as the number of false claims, but Congress can anticipate that over the large majority of cases, when someone has cheated the government a large multiple of times, the costs of investigation do go up. 
    This case, although the facts surrounding the investigation are not in the record, does illustrate that there are very heavy costs involved in prosecuting Medicare fraud. 
    There was a substantial degree of investigation that was required, and Appellee's criminal trial consumed four days.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I'm just curious, counsel. 
    Is this amount collectible against this man?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    The government has taken discovery from Mr. Halper in the civil action and has determined that he has substantial assets that were transferred out of his name into his wife's name and into his son's name. 
    And it's the opinion of the United States Attorney's Office that's responsible for this case that there is a good chance of collecting part or all of the judgment in this case should this Court reverse and allow the case to go forward.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="241.960" stopTime="251.054">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, the district court set the amount at $16,000. 
    Wasn't... isn't that a finding of fact that that's the reasonable amount of the government's cost?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="251.054" stopTime="277.822">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It is not a finding of fact. 
    This case was decided on summary judgment. 
    The government moved for collection of the full amount of the penalties to which it is entitled under the False Claims Act by virtue of the false claims. 
    It never submitted any evidence of its costs of investigation. 
    The district court essentially speculated about what it believed those costs of investigation would be, without any evidence whatsoever. 
    One of the objections that we have to this--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="277.822" stopTime="281.134">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It... it... it came to that conclusion by eight times $2,000?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    It simply said--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Was there any rationale given for the eight count... for the figure eight?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Not... not to my knowledge. 
    There is no rationale whatsoever except for the fact that the district court simply believed that that amount would be adequate in this case to cover the government's expenses.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="296.855" stopTime="306.052">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Dreeben, do you think that the amount of the so-called civil penalty has to bear some relationship to the cost to the government?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="306.052" stopTime="334.649">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    I think that in the average case it does have to bear some cost, but this Court made quite clear in Rex Trailer Co. v. United States that the task for deciding what a reasonable recovery would be per fraud is one for Congress so long as it remains within a reasonable realm of... of magnitude. 
    And clearly, $2,000, as an estimate of what the government would have to devote in terms of resources to prosecute fraud, is reasonable.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="334.649" stopTime="343.216">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I guess the statute has now been amended to a range of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="343.216" stopTime="384.091">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    It was amended in 1986, when Congress took a look at the False Claims Act, concluded that the $2,000 figure which had originally been set in 1863 had now been so eroded by inflation that it really was not fulfilling the purposes it was intended to fulfill. 
    And Congress accordingly did raise the figure that can be permitted for each false claim, and it allowed a certain amount of discretion to district courts to decide between $5,000 and $10,000 how much should be awarded. 
    But Congress did take a look at the false claims amount and realized that $2,000 in 1863 dollars would now be about $18,000.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --I think, Your Honor, to the extent that Congress displayed its awareness of this Court's decision in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess and that the Congress is presumed to be aware of other decisions of this Court that have held that reasonable lump sum penalties do help compensate the government for the heavy costs of investigation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="440.307" stopTime="462.114">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I'm sure Congress was aware that we... we might strike it down if it went too far, but what I'm trying to say is... is do we really take this as a congressional estimation of how much it costs to investigate and prosecute? 
    Was there any attempt whatever to estimate that? 
    Or rather, was it an attempt to pick a figure that we would leave alone?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="462.114" stopTime="495.155">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Well, I think that both elements are there. 
    There was not a scientific study that I'm aware of of how much it costs the government on average to investigate fraud. 
    But Congress was made aware that it is expensive to investigate fraud, and it did provide a figure that it felt would ensure that the government is fully compensated. 
    It also provided the $2,000 figure originally and the $5,000 to $10,000 range that's currently in existence to provide some deterrence so that there is an economic disincentive for continued false claims of this nature.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Specifically about the... the need for a particular dollar figure for costs, I'm not sure that it was. 
    But the legislative history does display a desire to ensure that the government is fully compensated, and there are repeated references to the fact that it's very difficult to ferret out and detect fraud. 
    To the extent that... that Congress is aware of... of these problems, it's entitled to pick a reasonable figure to address them.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    While I've got you interrupted, if there hadn't been a criminal proceeding here, I suppose... if there weren't a criminal proceeding in this case, I suppose the theory of the district court would mean that the case would have to be tried as a crime... as a criminal case.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="559.070" stopTime="573.017">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Yes, Your Honor, I think that it would. 
    But the district court essentially construed the sanction in this case to be so heavy as to amount to a criminal punishment, and the logic of its decision would require the case to be tried beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="573.017" stopTime="586.087">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So... so... so, some... you would have to... in a case like this, you would have to decide in advance what might... how much of a fine might be determined to be criminal?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    The government is not aware of how we would live with a ruling like this because we would never know in advance whether a case would be civil or criminal under the district court's test. 
    The district court did not even articulate why the ratio in this case was excessive and what ratios would satisfy it.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="605.038" stopTime="612.755">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I suppose you could say that the government knows that it's always a civil proceeding, but that if the fine is shown to be excessive, it's just scaled down.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    If the statute were written to permit that result, that would be a reasonable way to handle it, but the statute was not written that way. 
    The 1986 amendments make crystal clear that Congress anticipated mandatory, automatic forfeitures for each fraud that was committed on the government and it intended that the government be able to collect the penalty for each fraud that--

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Yes, Your Honor, it would if in fact it were a criminal sanction. 
    We think where the district court went wrong is in analyzing the False Claims Act to impose a criminal sanction at all. 
    The... the theory of the action is to compensate the government for false claims and for economic damages that occur from such false claims, and it is not intended to stigmatize the defendant as a violator of criminal laws and, therefore, is not within the scope of... of the coverage of the Double Jeopardy Clause in the first place. 
    This--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="682.098" stopTime="696.510">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So long as that's the theory, it's all right. 
    I mean, so all Congress has to say is at the beginning of a statute that imposes a $10,000 forfeiture or 100... or $1 million forfeiture, the theory of this statute is not criminal. 
    It is simply a civil penalty.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="696.510" stopTime="698.941">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But not the last. 
    Don't we have--

    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="700.781" stopTime="707.446">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --to look it to see if it bears any reasonable relationship to the... to the monetary cost to the government in the case?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="707.446" stopTime="786.307">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Well, I... I think that... that the second step of the inquiry that this Court has suggested does require some oversight of whether the penalty is so excessive as to transform it into a criminal one. 
    But the question of... of what dollar figure is necessary to compensate the government in the broad run of cases is one that is... that's clearly belongs to Congress. 
    And the deference that is owed to it is reflected in this Court's frequent admonition that it would take the clearest proof to overcome Congress' intent to create a civil sanction and to deem it transformed into a criminal one. 
    In fact, this Court has never found that a monetary penalty set by Congress in the fashion of the False Claims Act was so excessive as to be transformed into a criminal penalty. 
    The only settings in which this Court has overturned Congress' intent to create a civil judgment is when Congress has prescribed something like imprisonment or loss of nationality, which are the kinds of sanctions that are really not consistent with civil law at all. 
    But a fixed monetary penalty is a historically civil kind of remedy. 
    It is related to an action in debt, and this Court [inaudible] traced the history of actions in debt in Tull against United States and expressly viewed them as being a civil type of recovery.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="786.307" stopTime="791.151">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're saying we... we can never look into the... the monetary amount? 
    Is that your position?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="791.151" stopTime="798.074">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    No, no. 
    The Court has to look into it to some extent. 
    But it has to look into it with a very deferential approach to it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="798.074" stopTime="808.132">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    To determine what? 
    To determine whether it is reasonable to think that Congress was trying to come up with an amount that overall would compensate the government?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="808.132" stopTime="816.948">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    To determine two things: first, whether the amount that Congress came up with does bear a reasonable relationship to its purpose of compensating the government.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="816.948" stopTime="817.699">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You mean in the average case?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="817.699" stopTime="877.610">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    In the average case, that's correct. 
    Not in every specific case because Congress is legislating for the broad categories. 
    And the second factor is whether it's reasonably related to Congress' deterrent purpose without so moving into the realm of over-deterrence as to be essentially a criminal sanction. 
    There would come a point, I'm... I'm quite sure, where a... a fine would be so heavy that this Court could not say that it truly is civil in character, but I don't think that the False Claims Act comes close to that. 
    Fixed monetary sums of $1,000 were common in the early part of this century, and the Court had no difficulty in Hepner against United States and in United States v. Reagan in saying that those kinds of penalties were civil. 
    The False Claims Act was passed in 1863. 
    When Congress amended the False Claims Act in 1986, it did not even bring the $2,000 figure up to where inflation had eroded it. 
    It only increased it a small fraction of that amount.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="877.610" stopTime="933.845">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    My problem is that it... it is so obvious that it does not cost the government as much to prosecute 65 repetitive violations than it does to prosecute 65 separate violations. 
    That is such an obvious principle that any legislative body that had in mind providing for whatever you call the average case an amount that would not be taking from that defendant any more than would be necessary to compensate the government... any legislative body would take account of the fact of... of that economy of scale and... and would not say $2,000 per offense, but would say $2,000 per offense, with a maximum of blank dollars per prosecution or something like that. 
    Otherwise, I really... it doesn't seem to me the government is even trying to make the... to make the... it isn't the punishment fit the crime. 
    What would you call it? 
    The... the penalty fit the civil violation.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="933.845" stopTime="994.735">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Well, Your Honor, it does serve both the purpose of deterring repeated small frauds and of compensating the government. 
    And we've never denied that it has both of those functions. 
    Without some sort of a fixed monetary penalty that attached to each successive small fraud, there would be very little incentive for contractors not to try to commit small frauds in the hope of evading detection. 
    The Medicare program, for example, gets literally millions of claims made on it each year. 
    The government is not capable nor are its fiscal intermediaries capable of reviewing all of those claims. 
    So, it prescribes a figure that both allows it to get compensated when it does catch somebody and also provides an economic disincentive for continuing it. 
    If... if there were not a fixed penalty, the government would be virtually incapable of prosecuting and collecting damages for this kind of case because the... the burden on the government of showing how much did it cost for this FBI agent to conduct this interview--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    xxx. 
    Is there any... where did the district court find out, if it did, how much the government's expense was in investigating? 
    It said even adding that amount to the government's expense of investigating and prosecuting the statute, the total amount is excessive. 
    How did it know what it cost the government?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="1012.656" stopTime="1053.312">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Your Honor, I have no idea how the district court knows because it didn't set out any reasoning and it had no evidence. 
    I think the best explanation of it is that it speculated. 
    It substituted its judgment for Congress' judgment about what an appropriate penalty would be. 
    In other settings, Congress has provided formulas for recovery of damages and to ensure adequate deterrence of wrongdoing. 
    The best example of that is perhaps the treble damages remedy that's allowed for Sherman Act violations. 
    It has never been held by this Court that Congress cannot allow an action for treble damages to follow an action for criminal violations under the Sherman Act.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well... well, but in this statute I take it's your position that if the average that Congress somehow sets meets some rational standard, that the statute can never be criminally applied to any person no matter how excessive it is in his individual case.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you said earlier that the statute could be unreasonable.

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1088.487" stopTime="1095.541">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="1095.541" stopTime="1127.561">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --That's correct. 
    And as to this statute, that's right because the only reason why a penalty would be large is if someone had committed a very large number of false claims on the government. 
    That is the explanation for the penalty in this case. 
    Appellee committed 65 knowing false claims of which he was criminally convicted. 
    And the penalty for that corresponds only to that large number of false claims. 
    The statute isn't transformed into a criminal type of penalty simply because there are a large number of false claims involved.

    And there are going to be cases where the costs of prosecution do rise proportional to the amount of false claims. 
    So, for Congress to be limited in a way that requires it to reduce the government's compensation with the number of false claims may, in effect, deprive the government of full compensation in given cases. 
    So, the lump sum penalty does function, in the broad category of cases, to ensure that the government is recompensed for the costs of investigating these false claims and that it has a mechanism to ensure deterrence of the false claims. 
    We think that the consideration in the 1986 amendments of the penalty reflects a very recent congressional judgment that indeed the kinds of penalties involved in this case are civil and do not pose the double jeopardy problems that have been alluded to by the district court. 
    Congress specifically provided for a form of collateral estoppel between criminal convictions and the civil judgments which recognizes that it intended that one action follow the other. 
    It also recognized that in cases of Medicare fraud, there may be a very large number of false claims. 
    So, the congressional determination in this case was, indeed, that the statute be applied very much in the fashion that it was applied by the district court in this case. 
    If the district court's theory were adopted, the government would have virtually no way to ensure that it would be fully compensated when, as in this case, there are a great number of false claims. 
    I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

    Very well, Mr. Dreeben. 
    Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you now. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John G. Roberts, Jr.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1243.618" stopTime="1337.990">
    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    After punishing Mr. Halper with two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for his $585 in false claims, the government brought a second proceeding against him seeking a $130,000 penalty for those same false claims. 
    The district court correctly concluded that this would be punishing Halper twice for the same offense, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the judgment below should be affirmed. 
    Now, the government does not dispute that the second proceeding was based on precisely the same false claims for which Halper had been previously convicted and punished. 
    Indeed, the government relied exclusively on Halper's prior criminal conviction to establish his liability in the second action. 
    What the government says is that the $130,000 penalty should not be regarded as a second punishment because it served a remedial purpose, that of compensating the government for its losses. 
    But the facts belie that contention. 
    A $130,000 recovery cannot be dismissed simply as compensation for $585 in damages. 
    Nor is the answer any different if the government's costs of investigation and prosecution are factored into the equation. 
    The district court, which was intimately familiar with the details of Halper's fraud, the record in the case and all the judicial proceedings concluded that $16,000 would fully compensate the government for all its costs.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.

    That... that just seems like... a... a... an unusually complex burden to place on the government.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Well, I think it would really only come into play when you have a disproportion between penalty and actual damages as stark as it is in this case. 
    The government relies on the Hess case. 
    There the penalty recovery equaled the... the government's loss. 
    Here it was 220 times the government's loss. 
    In this sort of case, I think the district court does have to look and say if this is remedial, show me how this compensates you for loss and how it--

    Do you think the government can win its case just by producing average costs of investigation and prosecution of civil fraud?

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --No, I don't, Your Honor. 
    The government argues today that we shouldn't concern ourselves with what the facts are in any particular case, but just, as they've said, if it works out well enough as a general matter. 
    I don't think that's how the Double Jeopardy Clause works. 
    The issue is the rights of this particular defendant in this particular case, and it doesn't strike me as an adequate answer to say that the statutory formula works out well enough as a general matter in the average case. 
    And it shouldn't come as a surprise that there might be this disproportion between recovery and... and actual loss because the formula for calculating that recovery bears absolutely no relation to the government's loss. 
    It's based on the number of counts in the complaint, not actual damages or costs of investigation.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, supposing in this case, Mr. Roberts, the district court had found through whatever method he used that the costs were $16,000 and the statute required the imposition of a penalty of, say, $40,000. 
    Let's say there were 20 counts instead of 65. 
    Is that good or bad under your theory? 
    Can that be maintained as a civil prosecution?

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, it cannot.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, there's no play at the joints.

    There is play at the joints, and... and the district court recognized that in arriving at that $16,000 figure, it did have to take into account the difficulty of calculating the costs and... and... and the damages.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, I think there's a point at which the rational in Hess, in other words, compensating the government for its losses... there has to be a point at which... certainly he doesn't have to pay his share of the overhead on the... on the national debt. 
    These... the notion of the costs of investigation and prosecution is not a novel one. 
    In... in private litigation, indeed, in litigation involving the government, there are many cases where they are, for example, claiming attorney's fees. 
    It's fairly routine. 
    You submit an affidavit from the prosecutor detailing the costs involved.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --No, and not all the time of the one, just... just the time spent in this particular case because the issue concerns the rights of this particular defendant in this case. 
    And I don't think the principle that you can average out the Double Jeopardy Clause is one that this Court has accepted in the past. 
    Now, under the government's theory, the penalty in this case is remedial and compensatory, regardless of what the facts show. 
    I've pointed out the facts in this case, which I think are stark enough. 
    But the government says it could have prosecuted Halper under the amended act, in which case his minimum penalty would have been $325,000 and it could have gone up to $650,000. 
    A defendant who filed 200 false claims of $1 each for total damages to the government of $200 would face a minimum mandatory penalty of $1 million. 
    And still the government would say that that's remedial and compensatory. 
    And there's no reason to stop there. 
    If this Court accepts the government's theory, Congress can up the ante and raise the maximum penalty from $10,000 to $20,000 or $100,000 or $1 million. 
    There is nowhere to draw the line under the government's theory.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Supposing this were a criminal prosecution and exactly the same facts were shown, but the statute, after a criminal conviction, provided for a fine of $1 million.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    The only issue would be whether it violated the Eighth Amendment, the excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishment provision.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    And the Court specifically noted that the government, while it had not shown the amount of its damages, it didn't doubt that the government had been injured, and it was simply saying liquidated damages of $10,000 is close enough in this case. 
    The notion of permitting the recovery as liquidated damages is the same notion as in Hess.

    They're justifying this $130,000 penalty as remedial, as compensatory, and then they're saying they don't care if in any particular case it is so.

    I think at the end of the proceeding after liability has been established and the statutory penalty is set, if there is a disproportion, in this case, the $130,000 versus $585, then the district court says this doesn't look like compensation. 
    This looks like punishment. 
    Show me that it's actually compensation.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I don't think he's saying it should have been tried as a criminal case. 
    What he's saying is that this is a civil case and it can be brought, but only so long as you don't impose punishment a second time. 
    If you seek a recovery beyond the damages and costs, that's punishment and since the defendant has already been punished, he can't be punished a second time. 
    Now, the government has a fall-back position to this remedial and compensatory rationale, one that's flatly inconsistent with it. 
    It says that the penalty can be upheld because it will deter future false claims by Halper and others. 
    But it will deter by punishing. 
    As this Court noted in Bell v. Wolfish, deterrence is 
    "not a legitimate non-punitive governmental objective. " 
    It's a punitive objective. 
    The catch is, of course, that Halper has already been punished and can't be punished again. 
    The government relies on the distinction between criminal and civil proceedings. 
    It says that it can punish you twice in successive proceedings so long as in one of those proceedings the punishment is imposed in a civil forum. 
    Initially, I think there's something very counter-intuitive about that argument. 
    The government agrees that it can't punish you twice in two successive criminal prosecutions, in each of which the defendant would enjoy all the protections of criminal due process, the right to make the government prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to call and confront witnesses. 
    Under the government's theory it can punish you twice in successive proceedings but only so long as you don't have those protections in one of the proceedings.

    There may be a difference to the extent that the formula of triple damages is related to the government's loss and perhaps in that sort of a case, Congress could say triple damages will cover the costs of investigation and prosecution. 
    But this formula is completely unrelated to the government's loss. 
    It's... it's $2,000 per count regardless of how small the damage or how great. 
    One count fraud of $1 million gets you a $2,000 penalty, and Halper's $585 in false claims, of course, netted him a hundred--

    If you look back at the government's brief in the Hess case, for example, they had no doubt that... there that the penalty was, in essence, criminal. 
    The only thing they were concerned about was whether a private party could bring this suit and there somehow prevent the government from bringing a criminal prosecution.

    --I think so, and I... and I don't think, for example, it would apply in a case in which a private individual brings the antitrust action after a government prosecution under the Sherman Act. 
    And the current statute has very elaborate protective mechanisms in which the government can prevent a private qui tam action from interfering with any proceeding it may... it may wish to bring. 
    The... the government--

    That would have the quixotic effect of if the government brought the civil penalty action and... and sought the statutory amount of the penalty, you would urge a double jeopardy application.

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Well, that's right. 
    I know the... the Court has the... the Browning-Ferris case coming up in which it will decide whether the excessive fines provision applies to private actions. 
    But I don't think that's... that's implicated here.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2565.232" stopTime="2574.599">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The fine can be a fine even though not assessed in a... it possibly can be a fine for that purpose even though not assessed in a criminal proceeding.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2574.599" stopTime="2797.976">
    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's the... the argument I think in the... in the Browning-Ferris case, yes, which depending on how it comes out, would make... could lead to a curious result here. 
    If the... the Eighth Amendment doesn't apply at all to civil proceedings, then there's not even that limit on the extent of the civil punishment the government can impose. 
    And if it does apply in the civil proceeding, then the government presumably would say that this isn't punishment until it becomes excessive punishment, which would be an odd result. 
    There is no natural cutoff. 
    My brother today mentioned that there will come a point at which the recovery may be so excessive, but there's no logical way to draw that point other than the... the line that was drawn in Hess and in Rex Trailer when the amount exceeds the remedial purpose. 
    When it's no longer compensatory, then it is a second punishment. 
    And the fact that it's imposed in a civil forum makes no difference for the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 
    It makes no difference to the defendant whether this $130,000 penalty, the second punishment, is called criminal or civil because he has already been criminally convicted of the underlying offense. 
    The government refers to the greater stigma, the moral condemnation, that attaches to a criminal punishment. 
    But that argument simply doesn't work in this case. 
    The issue is not whether Halper is going to be stigmatized or morally condemned. 
    We know the answer to that. 
    He is for precisely these same false claims. 
    The issue is how many different times the government can punish him as a result of that moral condemnation, and the answer in the Double Jeopardy Clause is once. 
    The government's focus on the distinction between criminal and civil is... is misdirected. 
    Under the Double Jeopardy Clause, as this Court has frequently noted, there are three distinct protections: protects against a second prosecution after an acquittal, protects against a second prosecution after a conviction, and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. 
    Now, when the first two of those protections are at issue, you need to know if it's a prosecution. 
    Is this an inherently criminal proceeding? 
    But when the third protection is at issue, you simply need to know if it's a multiple punishment, if he's being punished a second time. 
    Finally, the government argues for reversal with a parade of... of horribles, all these routine civil sanctions after a conviction that will supposedly go out the door if the judgment is affirmed. 
    For example, it cites in its reply brief debarment from further government contracting, loss of a professional license, disbarment. 
    The decision below will not at all threaten those routine sanctions. 
    In each case, those sanctions can be justified with reference to a remedial objective: in the case of debarment, maintaining the integrity of the government contracting programs; in the case of disbarment, maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the bar. 
    Here there is no remedial justification for the $130,000 penalty. 
    It is punishment pure and simple. 
    Finally, the decision below will not upset the government's efforts to stamp out false claims. 
    It can bring a criminal action and get what are now very high fines, up to $250,000 per count, and then later bring a civil proceeding in which the defendant is collaterally estopped to collect all its damages, all its costs. 
    Or it can bring the civil proceeding separately. 
    I don't think anything in the holding below means that the government cannot collect this penalty in a civil proceeding. 
    It just means if he has already been punished, this is punishment and can't be brought--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2797.976" stopTime="2806.581">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It would also mean that the civil proceeding wouldn't be a civil proceeding, wouldn't it, that you have to have a reasonable doubt standard and all the safeguards that apply in a criminal trial?

    Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --No, Your Honor, I don't think it means that.

    But there's nothing in the logic of his decision that says you can't bring this alone. 
    The key to his conclusion was this was multiple punishment. 
    This was a second punishment. 
    I think it's a very different question whether it could be punished... whether you could be punished in a civil forum alone without the prior criminal conviction and punishment.

    The government says that it could have sought the civil penalty in the same proceeding with the criminal prosecution and then says why can't we seek them separately. 
    I think that conclusion misses the entire point of the Double Jeopardy Clause which is that there are things you cannot do twice that you can do once. 
    Whether the government could have sought this civil penalty together with the criminal fine and the sentence of imprisonment is entirely unrelated to the question of whether they can break it up and bring this additional punishment, punishment which follows automatically from the criminal conviction and the criminal prosecution in a separate proceeding. 
    The district court's decision that the Double Jeopardy Clause would be violated by the excessive punishment was correct and the judgment should be affirmed.

    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN--
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="2983.267" stopTime="3040.282">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Amicus focuses his argument solely on the proposition that if the second proceeding involves punishment, then it is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. 
    And he defines punishment to mean anything in addition to what the government can actually show are its out-of-pocket, actual losses. 
    This Court in the Hess case considered the identical argument to that and held that to the extent that a second action does impose some punishment, that is not enough to declare it a criminal sanction. 
    And the Double Jeopardy Clause's concern is with a second criminal sanction, not with a second proceeding that may to some extent impose punishment. 
    The Sherman Act treble damages remedy in punitive damages cannot be adequately differentiated merely because the government is not a party because amicus has argued that the prospective must be from the defendant, and the defendant experiences either second proceeding as punishment.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That's true, but the punishment in this case, if there is some, would be awarded by the court pursuant to a statute passed by Congress, and there's no reason why the Double Jeopardy Clause would not be concerned with it. 
    The Hess case itself involved a qui tam plaintiff, and the Court considered and evaluated the Double Jeopardy Clause even though the arguments were presented in the brief that the Double Jeopardy Clause might not have a role to play in that setting.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    No, Your Honor, we don't believe that it does violate the Double Jeopardy Clause for any civil action to follow a criminal one even if there is a recovery above and beyond actual damages because that is not the line that the Double Jeopardy Clause draws. 
    It protects against a second criminal proceeding because the Constitution draws a line between criminal and civil proceedings and determines that criminal proceedings have more severe consequences, but it does not bar a second civil sanction that can be imposed after the earlier criminal conviction.

    Isn't there another factor in the... in the qui tam action and in the treble damage antitrust actions that the extra recovery is partially justified as an incentive for the third private party to bring the action? 
    So, it's not strictly compensatory, but yet it... it pays for getting something done by getting the third party activated in the matter.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Yes, it does, Your Honor, but in... in the case where a criminal conviction has already happened and the private plaintiff brings the treble damages action, he's entitled to rely on the facts established in the criminal trial. 
    And the wrongdoer has already been exposed, so the costs of investigation would be far less in that kind of a--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, that's true. 
    But there's still the incentive. 
    If you're going to get treble damages instead of single damages, there's much more... greater motivation to bring the action.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="3158.339" stopTime="3172.831">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --That's true, Your Honor, but the same incentives exist in this case because if the government did not have the opportunity to recover penalties, it would be virtually incapable of prosecuting small frauds like this because the costs of prosecuting them would far outweigh the costs of investigating.

    There is a $250,000 per count penalty that could be--

speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="3182.076" stopTime="3189.461">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --That's correct, but under the Sentencing Commission guidelines, the fine would be assessed by looking in part at the actual damage to the government.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well--
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="3190.212" stopTime="3206.251">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    So, it's a very different formula that has been prescribed. 
    But the fact that there is such a broad difference between what can be recovered in a criminal proceeding and what the civil proceeding allows in terms of a penalty helps underscore that the civil proceeding does have a different purpose and a different effect.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Not to my knowledge, Your Honor. 
    There... there are other statutes where Congress has provided different kinds of formulas to attack this kind of wrongdoing. 
    There's more than one way to skin a cat in this setting, and Congress has provided for a mandatory, fixed-sum penalty in this act; in other acts, has provided for more discretion. 
    There is currently discretion between $5,000 and $10,000 under the False Claims Act. 
    But Congress is trying to do what it can to come up with adequate methods both to compensate and to deter.

    That... that discretion will presumably be... be limited by the... by the Commission, the Sentencing Commission, won't it?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Under the False Claims Act on the civil side, the Sentencing Commission would not have jurisdiction over it, only on the criminal side. 
    Amicus argues that the costs of investigation in this case were relatively small because the fraud was relatively simple. 
    The record in the civil case was not developed on the question of what sort of Investigation occurred. 
    But the record in the criminal case shows that an extensive investigation was necessary to bring this episode of wrongdoing to light. 
    It's not a simple matter of looking on the face of the claim form and determining whether or not there was a fraud. 
    To begin with, Medicare does not... and its fiscal intermediaries don't even review each form. 
    They rely on an honor system. 
    But more fundamentally, there was a need to determine whether in fact the services were performed that Mr. Halper claimed he had performed and attempting to determine the magnitude of the problem because the government is not--

    But the government is forced to devote an enormous amount of resources to trying to figure out in the first place is this a fraud. 
    Is it a fraud that's worth prosecuting? 
    It doesn't prosecute cases that involve one or two accidental misstatements on a Medicare form.

    They simply don't work that way. 
    The focus of the criminal episode is really to punish the defendant. 
    The focus of this kind of proceeding is to ensure that the government is compensated for the problem and to have a deterrent mechanism in place to prevent successive types of frauds like this.

    It is the government's position, though, that even if the government had lost the criminal prosecution, it could then have brought this action with a burden of proof not beyond a reasonable doubt, but just more likely than not, and imposed the... the level of fines that are at issue here.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That's correct. 
    It could go either way on that point. 
    We believe that the result that the district court reached in this case would require each court to speculate in each case about what the government's true damages were before it could decide whether the False Claims Act were civil or criminal in a given setting or, alternatively, it would force the government to attempt to quantify exactly how much it had spent in attorney time, how much it had spent in investigatory time, which is simply not a process that can reasonably be done. 
    It's precisely the reason why liquidated damages are provided in contracts. 
    This is not a direct... it's not directly identical to liquidated damages because Congress is legislating for a broad category of cases.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3438.675" stopTime="3446.449">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, it's not unusual to provide in a statute that the plaintiff recovers single, treble damages, plus attorney's fees, plus costs of suit.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That's correct, but costs are usually a very small component of the actual development of a case and bringing it to trial.
