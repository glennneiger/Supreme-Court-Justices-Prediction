    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Wyoming Supreme Court which the state contends erroneously quantified the Federal Reserved water right for the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
    The specific question before the Court is whether the practically irrigable acreage standard, or PIA standard, for the quantification of the employed federal right was properly applied below where there were state water rights congressionally mandated and acquired for the reservation and where there was no need shown for an additional water right as a reserved right. 
    The general question--

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    And the more general question that is before the Court, and the one that has drawn so much attention from the amici is the applicability, the universal applicability of the PIA quantification... standard to all reservations other than those in Arizona I. 
    After briefly describing the facts of our case, I would like to explain why the Wyoming court should be reversed. 
    If you have before you the cert petition itself, and the last page of that petition is a fold-out map showing the reservation. 
    And following along with that, let me make my explanation clear. 
    The reservation itself is located in northwestern Wyoming. 
    It's about 45 miles southeast of Yellowstone National Park and Little Small River in Yellowstone National Park. 
    The boundaries that you see on that map are about 60 miles from east to west and about 50 miles from north to south. 
    The reservation itself was set aside by treaty with the Shoshone in 1868. 
    There were approximately 2,400 Indians that are part of a band of Shoshone that were living to the west of the present reservation site. 
    Ten years later, in 1878, the Arapaho were forcibly placed on the reservation, to which the Shoshone strenuously objected and for which they received compensation in the 1930s for the loss of one-half of their reservation. 
    During the remainder of the 19th Century, there was every little development on the Indian Reservation, while around the Indian Reservation substantial non-Indian development took place. 
    So that by 1900, when only roughly 1,700 Indians remained on the reservation despite the fact that both tribes were now permanently located there, the Indians were desperate to get started in farming in earnest. 
    And Congress and the federal officials and the Indians themselves were very anxious about the availability of water to carry on that farming simply because of all the non-Indian irrigation development around the Reservation appeared to have called for more water than would allow the Indians to continue. 
    So--

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The concern that I mentioned of the Indians, federal officials, and Congress, led to the 1905 Act, which was a ratification of the 1904 agreement with the Indians. 
    And it was pursuant to the Water Proviso of that Act that these water rights were obtained. 
    The Water Proviso in Article III of the 1905 Act says that water rights shall be detained under state law.

    First was to open the reservation to non-Indian settlement in the portion that's marked as ceded on your map. 
    Everything north of the Wind, east of the xxx. 
    The second thing was to allow that land to be sold to non-Indians under the public land laws.

    Yes, sir, they are. 
    The second purpose was to take the proceeds that were enjoyed from the sale or the eventual lease of those lands and use them for the benefit of the... of the Indians. 
    And one of those benefits was to acquire water rights under state law, as I explained in response to Justice O'Connor's questions. 
    In fact, the congressional intent in this respect was so strong that when the Indian Rights Association was concerned about state rights being required for these Indian... for the Indian water rights, it was proposed in both committees of... excuse me... the committees of each House of Congress that a limited reserved right be established for the reservation. 
    And it was rejected. 
    It was not included in the 1905 Act. 
    And, again, in 1914, a permanent reserved right was proposed for the reservation and it too was rejected by Congress. 
    It was stricken on the floor of both Houses on a point of order as being a legislative matter attached to an appropriations bill. 
    So, Congress knew what it was doing. 
    It wasn't merely a way to spend a little extra pocket money. 
    It was a way to effectuate congressional intent. 
    After... after those water rights were obtained Congress did in fact... or, excuse me... the Federal Government did in fact construct substantial irrigation projects on the reservation.

    --That's right. 
    And by the beginning of 1910 and continuing through 1963 the government began to relinquish water rights which were obtained in excess of those which had actually been used, And by 1963, approximately 50,000 acres had been relinquished, leaving 87,000 acres under state rights.

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    Apparently they didn't need them, Your Honor, and the suggestion is made that the state cancelled these rights simply because the United States didn't come in and renew them. 
    The fact of the matter is that in 1944 a major portion of these water rights were voluntarily relinquished by the indian Service themselves. 
    The only evidence in the record is that there were water rights for far more land than was actually irrigated and was needed to be irrigated. 
    But in... finishing that question, the Court ought to contrast this Reservation with the Fort Hall Reservation where the same players were involved, the same negotiator and the same congressional committees. 
    And in 1900... excuse me... in 1904 for the Fort Hall Reservation, which is our sister reservation, Congress--

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    --Yes, sir, it is in Idaho. 
    Congress expressly created a reserved right. 
    This was a year before the Water Proviso on the 1905 Act. 
    So, the state would submit that there is no question that Congress intended that... and expressly intended, that state water rights serve the needs of this particular reservation. 
    The award below was, as Justice O'Connor points out, for approximately... for the irrigation of approximately 100,000 acres, of which 70 percent were, previously covered by state water rights, of which, of the 100,000, 55 percent were in the ceded portion. 
    And, is the Court will recall from the briefs, the ceded portion was restored back to the reservation in the 1940s for the purposes of grazing. 
    Water rights were quantified on that ceded portion, the restored ceded portion, not for grazing purposes, but under the practicably irrigable acreage standard.

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    That was the... the conclusion of the master, and it was the decision at the first district court judge that heard the case. 
    Post-trial motions were heard by a second Second District Court judge. 
    The first district court judge and the master directed their attention to the future projects. 
    There were about 50... of the total awards, half the land had been historically irrigated, the other half had been part of future projects that would be irrigated in the future according to the United States and Tripes evidence. 
    And it was the future projects that the court below, the master and the district court judge were most concerned about. 
    And they suggested that... first, the master... that the future projects not be allowed to go into operation right away. 
    And the master observed that would be no harm to the Indians because everyone knows they wouldn't be built anyway... they not be allowed to go into operation right away but be required to go in 10 percent per decade. 
    That was his thought. 
    The... the district court judge approached it a little bit differently. 
    He said that instead of the 10 percent phasing approach to putting these futures into effect, let's have storage, and if there is a future project that requires "x" acre feet, let's have storage in that amount. 
    The second district court judge that heard it, rejected the storage approach. 
    He rejected the concept of storage because it was part and parcel of estoppel. 
    What the first district court Judge had said was that the United States under these circumstances is estopped to claim a reserved right which would, in his words, put... or, render the state water rights virtually worth less. 
    Those were his words. 
    So, he said if there is estoppel, to remedy that estoppel we'll have the storage. 
    Now, the second district court Judge said, sorry, no affirmative misconduct by the United States. 
    When they acquired these state water rights, there wasn't anything wrong with that, so there wasn't any affirmative misconduct. 
    Estoppel doesn't apply. 
    So by the time we got out of the district court through our post-trial motions, there were no... no conditions imposed on the water right, on the reserved water right, which would serve to protect the owners of state water rights. 
    Now, that was completely gone and when we suggested that the sensitivity doctrine or the whole decision of this Court in New Mexico would require some inquiries as part of the quantification process into the factors described in New Mexico, the thought was by the Wyoming courts that those went to questions of purposes and they didn't go to the question of quantification. 
    The... what we suggested to the wyoming court was that the New Mexico decision and the decisions which immediately preceded that and followed it established four criteria for the... for the quantification of watery or of an implied reserved right. 
    First, that there be an inquiry into the specific purpose of the reservation, and our complaint with that was, of course, all of the restored lands were for grazing purposes, restored for grazing purposes. 
    They were not restored for irrigation purposes. 
    And yet, the PIA doctrine was used to quantify water rights for those restored lands. 
    In fact, the largest of the future projects... it takes... it's about about a hundred and... excuse me... about 40,000 acres of future project is located on restored land which was restored in 1944 for grazing purposes. 
    Yet, the water right that was quantified for it was for irrigation. 
    And that requires a remarkable clairvoyance on the part of Congress if part of this effort is to inquire into congressional intent that in 1944 water... land would be restored for grazing purposes and yet it receives an 1968 priority date for irrigation purposes. 
    The second thing that the New Mexico court... or, this Court in its decision in New Mexico, said was that there should be an inquiry into need for the water because this Court said that there had been a careful examination every time this reserved right doctrine had been applied to insure that the water was needed to keep the primary purpose of the reservation... or, the specific purpose of the reservation from being defeated. 
    There was no evidence of need in the court below, in the record below. 
    The thought of the United States... at trial... was all they needed to do was show PIA. 
    PIA, since Arizona 1 had become the standard--

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    I'm sorry. 
    And, as a practical matter, there wasn't any provided by the tribes in the United States. 
    The state, at the end of the case in chief, filed is Rule 41 motion... or, made its Rule 41 motion on the question of need. 
    And that matter... the question of need was no longer addressed by the court until we got to appeal. 
    Finally, there is... or, another factor this Court indicated in New Mexico should be considered is deference to state law. 
    It said that the Court had always been careful with the reserved right doctrine because of the implied nature of the reserved water right and Congress history of deference to state law. 
    And it also observed that when Congress had expressly addressed the question of whether state law should apply, that it had invariably deferred to state law.

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    --Where you're really trying to determine intent... as of 1868, as of the date of the treaty. 
    But just as Congress can enter into these various settlement acts to settle Indian water right disputes, it can adopt the 1905 Act. 
    And if any... in theory, anything that happened after 1905 is irrelevant. 
    But this case is here on the question of what is the proper quantification standard, not whether the water right continues to exist. 
    Now, had you accepted certiorari on the first question, we would have been arguing that you can stop in 1905 and not worry. 
    But you accepted certiorari on the second question, which is the measure of the reserve right, and that's... that's why we're here.

   Argument of Jeffrey P. Minear
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1326.789" stopTime="1399.403">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The sole question presented in this case is whether the Wyoming Supreme Court erred in following this Court's decision in Arizona I in measuring the tribe's reserved water right based on the PIA standard. 
    We submit that the Wyoming Supreme Court's decision was correct for three reasons. 
    First, this case is indistinguishable from Arizona I. 
    Second, this Court's decision in Arizona I is sensible and correct and should not be discarded or replaced. 
    And, third, the retention of Arizona I's PIA standard is essential to insure an orderly, efficient, and certain resolution of this and other ongoing Indian water rights disputes. 
    I would like to begin by emphasizing the question here is not a matter of first impression. 
    This Court addressed how to measure Indian water rights 25 years ago in Arizona I. 
    It applied the PIA standard, relying on Special Master Rifkin's careful analysis of the matter. 
    Arizona I's logic is both straight forward and compelling. 
    Since the United States set the reservation lands asl de to enable the Indians to become productive farmers, the natural measure of their reserved water right is the amount of water necessary to make their agricultural land productive. 
    The Court's reliance on irrigable acreage was not novel.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Again, this... this is all outside the record, first of all. 
    This was brought up by Wyoming in addition of their factual statement described as subsequent events outside the record. 
    So, I don't know now much you'll find in terms of accuracy, in terms of what actually happened here. 
    But I believe it's the tribes' view that this was a comprehensive settlement of certain other matters, as well as certain water rights disputes. 
    But I'd like to return to what... the question you originally raised, Justice Scalia, which is the measure of the water and the water right when the reservation land was set aside. 
    I think it's quite logical that when these parties determined a set amount of acreage to be set aside for a reservation and also determined that a certain amount of that land would be available for farming... in this case, it's less than five percent of the total reservation acreage... that the reserved water right would be sufficient to meet those farming needs.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    They would exceed Bureau of Reclamation standards. 
    The... the economic analysis that we impose on Indian projects is in fact stricter than the Bureau of Reclamation's analysis. 
    And, in facts that has been one of the concerns of the tribe, that we in fact impose more rigorous economic requirements on the tribes than the Bureau of Reclamation imposes on non-Indian farmers. 
    As far as these projects being constructed, these projects can be constructed. 
    I think there's a good likelihood that they would be constructed because they in fact would bring in income to the tribe. 
    These are not simply fantasy projects. 
    These are real projects that have been analyzed based on sound engineering, scientific and economic factors. 
    And we... one need only examine the Special Master's report to see how carefully these matters were in fact considered.

    Essentially what they would do is they would increase the water supply to land that is practicably irrigable. 
    That is irrigable in that sense. 
    That this is... there is good farm land cut there that could be in fact put to use and could grow profitable crops that could be sold on the market.

    --Well, the projects might nave been smaller, but there would nave been much greater water usage. 
    And I think there are three good reasons for using the current technology, in any event. 
    Our first is a matter of precedent. 
    This is what was done in Arizona I. 
    And, in fact, this Special Master notes... I think that's at page 535(a) of the Special Master Report. 
    Second, simply as a matter of the feasibility of proof. 
    We can in fact get experts who can testify on the economics and the engineering aspects of present irrigation systems. 
    And those matters can be proven. 
    This is a matter that is, to use Wyoming's terminology, capable of proof. 
    Trying to prove 1868 irrigation technology would be fairly speculative and I think would probably make the... would decrease the accuracy of the actual water determination here.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --or, the tribes, in fact, are growing alfalfa and small grains. 
    The economic analysis was based on those particular crops. 
    Those are the same crops that are grown by non-Indians. 
    On that subject, since we're talking... since Wyoming did raise the question of the restoration of lands for grazing purposes, I think that's incorrect, and I would simply refer you again to the Special Master's Report in the petition appendix. 
    The petition appendix indicates in the restoration orders... there is no mention that these lands were restored for grazing purposes. 
    They are simply restored to the tribe to be used for whatever purposes might be appropriate. 
    And so it's perfectly acceptable to quantify the water right on that based on the fact that they can be irrigable land.

    It established the PIA standard.

    And what we actually did here is we simply did not renew them. 
    These permits nave not been cancelled. 
    And, in fact, there is a phase three proceeding in this... in this case that will in fact go through the permits one by one and determine which permits should be retained and which should be formally cancelled by the state.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    The third reason is I think that this is consistent with what Congress probably intended back in 1868. 
    When Congress looked at this... or, I should say, the treaty partners since this is a treaty in this case, and it should be interpreted with respect to the Indians in that regard. 
    But I think the treaty parties recognized that the Indians would have ample water to irrigate their lands. 
    In fact, it's reasonable for the tribes to believe they would have had all the water in this water shed since the lane was being set aside for them. 
    But, in any event, they probably were not thinking about a specific number of acre feet of water that would be applicable, And I think the best inference of what they would have intended is that when... if there came a time and need for quantifying that standard, or quantifying the amount of water that is necessary, it would be done on the best available information. 
    And that's what we've done here in 1980. 
    I think that Wyoming all but concedes that this case is indistinguishable from Arizona I and, therefore, at least in its brief, it's forced to argue that Arizona I itself must be discarded or replaced. 
    Now, we disagree with this. 
    This Court does not lightly discard its precedence.

    And I think it's very reasonable to assume that the size of the Reservation and the amount of arable land that was set aside for them represented the best judgment of the treaty partners of what their future needs might be. 
    I don't know how else you would measure the future needs except by the amount of land that the parties determined was necessary to meet those future needs.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    I think it does in the sense that they do need... that the measure of necessity is the amount of water that's needed to irrigate the practicability irrigable land. 
    And, In fact, that's what. 
    Wyoming had argued. 
    If you look at their objections to the Special Masters Report, pages 24 through 27, their objection to the PIA standard was... In fact, they did not object. 
    They said that that was the... in essence argued that that was a part of the minimal needs test. 
    The PIA standard should be applied in this case.

    I don't believe so, except tot the fact of the matter... not in this case... that we're being held... the tribes are being held to a stricter efficiency standard than anyone else in both their historic lands and their future lands. 
    And, again, this simply verifies that the amount of water that was quantified here is really quite reasonable.

    And with respect to the notion of shortages the Chief Justice raised, I'd simply point out that the Wyoming Supreme Court noted here that there would be... there was no indication of any gallon-for-gallon reduction in this case. 
    And for that reason, it eliminated the storage requirement that was... that had been imposed by the lower courts in any event.

   Argument of Susan M. Williams
speaker="susan_m_williams" startTime="2489.866" stopTime="2622.084">
    Ms. Susan M. Williams 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    If the time permits me today, I would like to emphasize just two points. 
    First, the natural understanding of the treaty at issue in this case is that the United States and the Shoshones reserve sufficient water to irrigate all of the reservations. 
    That is, their permanent homes, farmable land for both the present and for the future generations. 
    This vested property right cannot now be easily discarded or replaced without clear and unambiguous congressional abrogation. 
    Second, water quantification standards other than the PIA standard either legally or infirm because they take the future out of the Winters Doctrine, as is the case with the proposed historically irrigated acreage standard, or they do not achieve the fixed present determination of Indian water rights long mandated by this Court. 
    Moreover, any standard other than PIA simply is not fair or just in light of the historic and the present conditions on the Wind River Reservation. 
    Before the treaty and the Reservation's creation, the Shoshones hunted and fished in what are now three western states. 
    After the treaty, the Shoshone agreed to live in a very much diminished land area although this still is the third largest reservation in the country. 
    They would subsist primarily on agriculture. 
    No evidence exists anywhere in this case that the great Chief Washike in 1868 failed uncharacteristically to consider the needs of all of his people, both the future generations as well as the present generations when he reserved lands in the best water area of Wyoming. 
    The only way to have considered both the present and the future generation's needs for water was to reserve at least the water necessary to farm the reservation's farmable land. 
    In 1908 this Court in winters recognized that when reservations were set aside, water was set aside for all time. 
    In 1963 this Court in Arizona against California I--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2622.084" stopTime="2632.492">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Ms. Williams, the Winters Doctrine was just an intent that this Court attributed to Congress, wasn't it? 
    Congress didn't say in so many words, in the reservations we're setting aside the water.
speaker="susan_m_williams" startTime="2632.492" stopTime="2677.337">

    --That's correct. 
    It is this Court's reading of the implied intent of Congress, and indeed the implied intent of the Indians, as the tribes submit, is that they would set aside land and sufficient water to farm all of that much diminished reservation after having prior to that time having economic opportunities to hunt and fish in a vast public... vast domain out west. 
    In 1963 this Court in Arizona against California concluded that the only feasible and fair way to achieve that fixed present determination of Indian agricultural water for present and for future Indian needs since population increases are difficult to predict, is the PIA.

    Ms. Susan M. Williams 
    We are not clear, but it was something much smaller than that size there. 
    But, again, in 1868 the chief of the Shoshones had in mind to protect and to reserve water not only for the then xx. 
    Water Proviso that authorized the expenditure from the remainder of $85,000 after a per capita payment was to be made to the Indians is such clear and unambiguous congressional intent to divest the property right, the water right, that was set aside in 1868. 
    This just makes no sense at all for several reasons. 
    First of all, the $85,000 was the tribe's money. 
    That was money set aside from the receipts of the land sales in the open area of the reservation. 
    The vast portion of that was to be spent on a per capita distribution to the tribal members at that time. 
    Only the remainder, said the United States, could be used to purchase state water permits for the reservation at a time prior to this Court's decision in 1908 when there was uncertainty as precisely the scope of the federal reserve water right, and, indeed, the quantification of it. 
    Any standard against this backdrop of an 1868 right, a 1905 Act statue by Congress that does not clearly divest that right, as required by this Court, that would serve as a substitute for the PIA standard, as Wyoming submits, must be premised on the need for future water. 
    That is legally unsound. 
    It is blind to present facts, and it grossly distorts history. 
    The need, the equities, as this Court pointed out in Cappaert unanimously in 1976, are not to be balanced in determining the scope of federal Indian Reserve water. 
    Though not legally relevant, Wyoming suggests that the tribes nave had ample opportunity to demonstrate the amount of water needed for this reservation, ignoring utterly that over the last 80 years the Federal Government has funded irrigation projects at Wind River and throughout the west primarily for the benefit of non-Indians. 
    A bias described in 1973 by the National Water Commission as one of the sorrier chapters in the history of the United States government's treatment of Indian Tribes. 
    This federal bias is starkly in evidence at Wind River. 
    Over $70 million has been spent on Irrigation projects that benefit primarily the non-Indians. 
    Only $4.4 million, in contrast, has been expended by the United States government, for the Indian irrigation projects. 
    In these circumstances, the state simply cannot in good faith argue that the tribes have had ample opportunity to demonstrate their need for water. 
    The Indians' need for water in this case now should come as no surprise to the state. 
    In 1905 the United States, as a pre-Winters precaution, obtained permits for about 125,000 acres of land for Indian irrigation. 
    Indeed, before trial, the state argued 102,000 acres on this Reservation were PIA. 
    The simple fact is these tribes, under any standard, need the water awarded to them by the Wyoming Supreme Court, which, as we have shown in our briefs, is a modest award considering the amount of acres per tribal member now and over time that can be irrigated with this award. 
    Agribusiness represents the only certain hope for this tribe's sustained economic future on this reservation. 
    This reservation is large, but it is remote, and it has considerable available land. 
    Its only other natural resource is oil and gas. 
    It is depleting very rapidly. 
    With 70 percent of the tribal members unemployed, expanded agriculture and related businesses, even if only as subsistence, can make a real difference. 
    The tribe... the Shoshone Tribe recently executed a contract to sell all of the barley it can produce. 
    In addition, many tribal members are cattle producers, but due to the lack, of grasses to feed their cattle through the winter, they currently sell those calves at less than half the weight the cattle Industry's experience shows is where the major profit lies. 
    Only through expanded agriculture now on the presently idle and the future lands to produce a winter feedstock... the natural grasses on the reservation are not on the winter pastures... will the cattle industry on the reservation be able to thrive. 
    In short, by any definition, the tribes in this case need their future water. 
    For the first time in their history, the Shoshone and the Arapaho Tribes are poised to build a sustained and productive reservation agricultural economy. 
    This is what their ancestors envisioned in 1868 and what the tribes must do in 1989 to alleviate staggering unemployment and poverty-related social ills on this reservation. 
    Not only will the tribal people benefit from this, but so will the regional economy as dollars flow off the reservation for machinery, retail, and for other purposes.

    Ms. Susan M. Williams 
    The reserved right that was set aside in 1868 was to be primarily for agricultural purposes. 
    But what the Indians intended impliedly in 1868 was to have water sufficient to live on that reservation for all time. 
    We would argue that the Shoshones and the Arapahos should not be subject to any restrictions as to transfer of uses because no other water rights holder in this country is so similarly restricted. 
    If the need for water in the short-term is for uses other than agriculture, we would submit that the tribes should not be restricted from doing so.

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    I do, Your Honor. 
    The suggestion was made by counsel for the tribes that they are poised for a period of economic development, and reference was made to a number of examples of why that position is now enjoyed. 
    I'd point out to the Court that none of that material is in the record. 
    There was no evidence below of any poised tribe, or anything like that.

    --I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
    I tried to make it clear that that was outside the record. 
    There have been... there has been some suggestion that the... there is no acre-for-acre... or, excuse me, gallon-for-gallon reduction in Wyoming for state water rights as a result of the reserved right. 
    And that is what the wyoming Supreme Court did say. 
    But the triers of fact, the Master in the district court, did not say the same thing. 
    At page 232(a) of the Petitioner's Appendix you will find the district court's observation that 
    "holders of state awarded water rights will find their formerly valuable water rights worthless. "

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    Yes, sir. 
    It's also been suggested that the 55 percent of the PIA that was restored to the reservation had no relation to grazing purpose. 
    No purpose at all was described. 
    I would refer the Court to page 741(a) of the Petitioner's Appendix in which is located the restoration order for the largest of the future project. 
    And it says, whereas the tripes... quote... 
    "require additional grazing land to support their expanded livestock industry. " 
    --close quote... there will be a restoration.

 Mr. White, suppose these were all state water rights that had been involved here and they weren't being used completely and the water that wasn't being used flows on down the stream. 
 Suppose they wanted to use the water for something else, would the Junior appropriators down below have a valid objection?

    Mr. Michael Douglas White 
    --I'm sorry, Your honor. 
    As have been argued. 
    The state water right user, if he wished to change his water right to a different use or a different place of use or a different time of use, would have to demonstrate that that change would not injure anyone else. 
    Not only that it wouldn't injure anyone else, but that there had been continued use over a long period of time, over a long what's called historic use, before that change could be made. 
    Each of the western states has a mechanism established for changing existing state water rights. 
    None of them allow a change without an inquiry into historic use and injury.
