    We'll hear argument next in No. 88-357, Norm Maleng v. Mark Edwin Cook. 
    General Eikenberry, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I'm appearing here this morning in opposition to a petition by prison inmate Mark Edwin Cook for issuance of the great writ of habeas corpus. 
    The question presented here, in our view, is this: does a Federal Court have subject matter jurisdiction over a habeas corpus challenge to a 1958 robbery conviction, the sentence for which had expired before the petition was filed but which may have an effect on the length of time to be served in the future on another sentence for an unrelated crime. 
    Now in addition to this issue, which may be viewed as somewhat technical, we think there's an additional and necessarily related question, and that is what are the standards and the scope of review to be applied in a challenge to the length of that future sentence.

    But the beginning point, of course, was in 1958, where Mr. Cook was convicted of three counts of robbery and sentenced to three terms of not more than 20 years. 
    That sentence has now expired, which we think is a critical feature of the case before the Court. 
    The second conviction was in 1965, when Mr. Cook was convicted of three counts of robbery and sentenced to three 50-year terms, and, incidentally, a detainer has been placed on that conviction. 
    The third conviction occurred in 1976 in federal court, when Mr. Cook was convicted of robbery and conspiracy with 25 and 5-year terms, and that is the case on which he is now in custody at Lompoc, California. 
    And then the fourth and final conviction that brings us to court today is a conviction in state court in 1976, with the sentencing occurring in 1978, in which he was found guilty of two counts of assault in the first degree and sentenced to two life terms and then another court of aiding a prisoner to escape, with a 10-year term.

    Your Honor, there was no grid or anything at that point which we would say that the court looked in determining what length of time there would be. 
    Rather, it was simply a matter of the '58 conviction having been in the background, the sentencing court in '78 being aware of it, and the impact that may or may not have had on that maximum term of two life terms we can only guess.

    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    We do not know, Your Honor, but the point of the question I think is extremely important because we are seeing the prospect here that we must imagine that that court also was aware that a '58 conviction had occurred and would have had it in mind, taken it into account as the court settled on the 25-year term. 
    So they may or may not, but we would have to bet probably was an effect on that sentence imposed in '76 by the federal court. 
    And so the interesting question then would be, does that create the custody that Mr. Cook is asking for in the '58 conviction, and we assert that it does not.

    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Exactly. 
    And then the question is what kind of challenge may be brought to that previous conviction that was used and considered in imposing the death penalty. 
    And what we're submitting to the Court is that the review given to that earlier conviction is different in scope than what would be given to the immediate trial and the immediate conviction, because the review would simply look to see whether or not the previous convictions were invalid on their face or whether they had previously been determined by another court to have been invalid. 
    And we're thinking here, for example, of the Tucker case, in which the trial court had learned of three felony convictions of the defendant before him, and then when it came time for sentencing the court specifically considered those three convictions, and only after the sentencing learned that two of them were invalid on their face when the record came before the court. 
    And that matter was then before this Court and it was sent back for resentencing. 
    So there was a case of the general rule being that a sentencing court or a reviewing court will allow a sentencing judge to consider a wide range and a very loose sense and flexible standard as to the convictions that may be considered. 
    But--

    We're submitting, Your Honor, that Mr. Cook in no way is, in the words of section 2254, in no way is he a person in custody pursuant to the judgment ordered by our state court in 1958.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="672.795" stopTime="702.831">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, now what if the '78 conviction were a habitual offender. 
    The Washington statute says if the sentencing judge finds in the sentencing procedure that you have two additional felonies, then you can be committed for 20 years where under the '78 charge you could only be committed for 5 years. 
    The sentencing judge does find that there was an additional felony committed in '58 and so he sentences him as a habitual offender. 
    Is that reviewable if he's in custody under the '78?
speaker="kenneth_o_eikenberry" startTime="702.831" stopTime="721.710">
    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Yes, because there is a critical difference in the kind of proceeding the Court's just described. 
    That is a habitual criminal proceeding. 
    The defendant is being found guilty of a new status. 
    It's a different crime, if you will, and so that's all part of the newest conviction and sentence, and it is reviewable.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="721.710" stopTime="738.905">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Okay. 
    Well, then what was the situation with respect to what the '78 sentencing judge did with respect to the '58 conviction? 
    Did he say in so many words that I'm taking this into account, I'm giving you a heavier sentence?
speaker="kenneth_o_eikenberry" startTime="738.905" stopTime="771.243">
    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    No, Your Honor, he did not say that, and we cannot, I don't think we can know at this point exactly what role, if any role, it had in determining that Mr. Cook should be sentenced to two life terms. 
    Now I should mention and anticipate the argument that you'll hear in a moment because in addition to the sentence to two life terms Mr. Cook, when he comes back to the State of Washington, will go before a parole board, if you will, and his minimum term will be set. 
    And we've had more events in the meantime.

    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Let me, if I may, Your Honor, go to the sentencing standards that this Court has established in three cases because I think that might bring us to the question that's been raised here. 
    We agree that in reviewing a sentence which places a person in custody the court should consider prior convictions which were a factor in making that determination. 
    The cases and common sense tell us that proper... those are proper subjects for a sentencing court to consider. 
    I indicated that the Tucker case before sets out the general rule, which is that in the absence of circumstances such as Jones or Hensley or Tucker then a trial judge, and I'm quoting from Tucker, 
    "A trial judge generally has wide discretion in determining what sentence to impose. " 
    "Before making that determination, a judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry, broad in scope, largely unlimited as to the kind of information it may consider or the source from which it may come. " 
    And three Justices of this Court, in a dissenting opinion in Schaal versus Martin not long ago, relied on that language and phrased it a little differently. 
    "The Constitutional limitations upon the kinds of factors that may be relied on in making such decisions are significantly looser than those decisionmaking processes that abridge the liberty of presumptively innocent persons. "

speaker="kenneth_o_eikenberry" startTime="1092.383" stopTime="1124.171">
    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Well, what I'm attempting... the reason for reading that quotation was simply to indicate the general rule and indicate that there is... that a sentencing court has a looser set of restrictions, If you will, on what factors may be considered in arriving at a sentence, but, conversely, when this Court is reviewing that process we must recognize that that court had a wide discretion and therefore the only thing we would look at at the '58 conviction, with an expired sentence, is is it valid on its face.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1124.171" stopTime="1151.988">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    General Eikenberry, the Court of Appeals said, on page A3 of the appendix, its opinion that the respondent's conviction was lengthened by two and one-half years because of his prior convictions. 
    Now is that consistent with what you said earlier, that we just can't say what happened in 1978?
speaker="kenneth_o_eikenberry" startTime="1151.988" stopTime="1180.007">
    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    A couple of important things, Your Honor. 
    First, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the law. 
    It is referring there to a statute that is no longer authority and simply didn't apply the law that was in effect. 
    But it doesn't make much difference to us in arguing the case to the Court. 
    We can acknowledge, will acknowledge that there may... the betting is that there will be an effect from that 1958 conviction.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1180.007" stopTime="1192.915">

   Argument of John B. Midgley
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="1558.132" stopTime="1585.068">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Mark Edwin Cook's habeas petition is not a request to have this Court rule that he is in custody on the 1958 conviction. 
    Mr. Cook is in custody; we know that because he is in prison. 
    He is in prison based on both the federal and state convictions that Mr. Eikenberry has discussed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1585.068" stopTime="1592.488">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is that strictly accurate, to say that he is presently in prison by virtue of the state sentence as well as the federal sentence?
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="1592.488" stopTime="1622.341">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I believe it is correct under a combination of both Peyton versus Rowe and Braden versus the Thirtieth Judicial District cases. 
    Under Peyton, Peyton I think uses the word "aggregate" of the sentence, that he is in custody on the aggregate, so he is certainly in prison on the aggregate of them. 
    And I believe that Braden deals with the question of where the petition may be brought on the state conviction.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1622.341" stopTime="1636.665">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    He may be in custody under our cases pursuant to the Washington, but I think you said he was in prison presently pursuant to the Washington conviction. 
    I thought that just wasn't factually correct.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="1636.665" stopTime="1640.469">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    Well, he is in... that's right. 
    He's in prison--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1640.469" stopTime="1641.319">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    For the federal sentence.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="1641.319" stopTime="1723.540">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    --On the aggregate. 
    He's now in the federal sentence, that's correct, and will serve the Washington sentence consecutively. 
    I didn't mean to suggest that he was in a Washington prison at this point because he's not. 
    But the jurisdictional question of where he may bring the habeas petition I believe that if you look at both Peyton versus Rowe and Braden he is allowed to attack the future sentence, obviously, under Peyton, and under Braden I think that he could have brought it in California, I believe, under Braden. 
    But I think that Braden implies that you can also bring it in the judicial district where it was obtained. 
    If not, then I would suggest that the only relief in this case would be to vacate the petition and simply state that it be refiled in California. 
    We don't believe that is necessary under the Braden case, but that would be the situation. 
    Now, Mr. Cook is simply claiming that the 1958 conviction lengthens the amount of time he will have to spend in prison on his 1978 state sentence, and this, as this Court said in Preiser versus Rodriguez, where you're talking about the duration of the actual physical confinement that you will have to spend in prison, is within the core of federal habeas corpus.

    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    Justice Scalia, there are a number of answers to your question. 
    First of all, your question presumes that Mr. Cook knew that there was something to challenge. 
    Now the only record we have in this case is that in 1977, when they tried to impose the habitual criminal proceedings on him, the state brought out these documents which they conceded did not show that there had been a competency hearing. 
    That was the only point we know in this record that Mr. Cook himself may have had some idea that there was a problem.

    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    --Well, the convictions were not invalid on their face in Tucker at the time sentence was imposed. 
    The California... in my recollection, the California... Tucker is a 2255. 
    He filed the 2255 long after sentence and said a court has invalidated the prior convictions; now I don't think they're valid. 
    And the federal court, the Ninth Circuit, said then they can't be considered. 
    And this Court said the question of his third prior conviction is still open. 
    And Washington law requires that the underlying convictions be constitutional. 
    It does not require, under the Ammons and the Bush cases that we've cited in the briefs... and this is a key point... does not require that the state affirmatively prove the constitutional validity in the sentencing proceeding. 
    But it does presume their constitutionality because--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2146.646" stopTime="2152.264">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, we didn't certiorarily take this case to pass on some peculiarity of Washington law.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2152.264" stopTime="2176.765">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    --I understand that. 
    But the important point is that Washington does presume the constitutionality of the convictions to support its sentence. 
    And it directs people to go to their collateral remedies and if then they are declared invalid for this use, which is all Mr. Cook is claiming... he is not claiming he is in prison on the 1958.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2176.765" stopTime="2202.113">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So supposing that we get to the parole board situation after your client has served his federal sentence and suppose the parole statute simply says that the parole board may take into consideration, among a number of other factors, previous convictions. 
    Would you say that that would be enough to allow him to challenge the '58 conviction?
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2202.113" stopTime="2204.982">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    I would... first of all, that isn't the case that's before us.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2204.982" stopTime="2209.386">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But we need to probe a little bit to find out what you're getting and what we're getting at.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2209.386" stopTime="2234.685">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    I think that Tucker says that any consideration... that Tucker implies, if you will, that any consideration of invalid priors is... would give grounds for collateral relief. 
    But that is not necessary... it is not necessary to go that far to decide this case, because in this case mandatory state statutes require that a certain amount of time be added.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2234.685" stopTime="2244.457">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So that if the claim as to the '58 conviction were that his Miranda rights were violated, that could be litigated in this case now.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2244.457" stopTime="2291.355">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    I think that that is... the state has brought this up on a custody question and I think that is a substantive constitutional question which is not before the Court because whether a particular kind of claim can be brought is not a custody issue; it is a question of substantive constitutional law about whether, for example, an uncounseled conviction... I think Tucker and Burgett talk specifically about uncounseled convictions, and I think that the state essentially is asking this Court to decide in advance a whole array of substantive constitutional questions about which kinds of convictions. 
    Are they saying that you can't attack a prior where there wasn't a trial, that that couldn't violate due process in any circumstance?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2291.355" stopTime="2297.675">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Well, do you say that you can attack a prior under these circumstances when there was simply a violation of the Miranda rule?
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2297.675" stopTime="2320.688">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    I think that, to address the issue that's before the Court in this case, I think there would be custody to make that claim, and it would then be a substantive constitutional question whether a Miranda violation, using a conviction which was allegedly invalid under a Miranda violation, is itself a constitutional violation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2320.688" stopTime="2324.492">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Yes.

    What does have the impact of constraining the board is the mandatory state statute which says if he has the 1958 conviction you must give him more time in prison.

    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    And about what the quality of that evidence is. 
    And that's part of what this Court has said and all the circuits in playing out the implications of this Court's decision, this is not something I'm proposing. 
    This is something the circuits have been doing for many years, and this is not something we're proposing as a great expansion of habeas corpus jurisdiction because it's been being done. 
    But the question is the reliability, the constitutional reliability of that information, and this court has said that those prior convictions which are unconstitutional are not, at least as to counsel... and, we would suggest, as to the kind of defect we have in this case where the defendant claims he was incompetent at the time of the trial... is a fundamental defect which casts doubt on the reliability of the conviction. 
    And that's unreliable information. 
    That goes all the way back to Townsend versus Burke. 
    You can't sentence on the basis of a due process violation. 
    You sentence on the basis of material, untrue information. 
    And this Court, as recently as Johnson versus Mississippi, talked again about not having that sort of unreliable information in sentencing. 
    And that's what these cases are based on, and that's the basis of the constitutional violation that we're claiming. 
    And the state again is going back and trying to get this Court to determine those substantive questions, and that is not, we submit, the question before this Court. 
    He is in custody. 
    He's claiming that his custody was lengthened by an unconstitutional prior conviction, and habeas corpus--

    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    They have, and we've cited cases in our brief and both of the amicus briefs have cited circuit cases from as far back, I believe, as the '60s, following, but at least from the early '70s following this Court's lead in Burgett and Tucker, and looking at priors which do make these kinds of enhancements.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2971.490" stopTime="2974.175">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Of course, both Burgett and Tucker were uncounselled.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2974.175" stopTime="2975.794">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    Yes, that's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2975.794" stopTime="2977.644">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    This Court has never gone beyond that.
speaker="john_b_midgley" startTime="2977.644" stopTime="3052.392">
    Mr. John B. Midgley 
    This Court has not gone beyond that. 
    This Court did say in Burgett that prior unconstitutional convictions should not be used to enhance sentence, but they were dealing with, the Court was certainly dealing with uncounseled convictions. 
    And the circuits have all applied it, certainly, to that, to that issue. 
    But that's correct. 
    Burgett and Tucker did not go beyond the issue of counsel. 
    Finally, I'd like to add that there is a counsel issue in this case, and that is simply that of course if a person's incompetent he doesn't have the ability to assist counsel. 
    Obviously there are also issues of presence, and we're saying essentially that this is such a fundamental defect that there's no question that he should be able to raise this in his federal habeas petition. 
    So for all the reasons that we've stated, we ask that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed because Mr. Cook is in custody, because he challenges the length, the duration of his imprisonment as unconstitutional, and that is what section 2254 and 2241 require. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Midgley. 
    Mr. Eikenberry, General Eikenberry, do you have rebuttal? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Kenneth O. Eikenberry
speaker="kenneth_o_eikenberry" startTime="3058.614" stopTime="3147.437">
    Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry 
    Yes. 
    May it please the Court: 
    Two points. 
    The first point is that the 1958 conviction is valid. 
    It has been found to be valid in Washington courts, and I suppose if we had to predict we might well make it on the competency issue even today, if it were heard out. 
    That is, the defense lawyer for Mr. Cook made the motion to the court to have doctors appointed. 
    The defense lawyer presented the order to have Mr. Cook transported to the hospital. 
    The record shows the doctors were paid and then Mr. Cook went to trial with that same lawyer. 
    So if there's a question for Mr. Cook to raise that were legitimate it would perhaps be as to competence of his counsel-- 
    But we think that's all really beside the point because the conviction has been found valid on its face. 
    The point that we'd like to make is this is being brought 27 years after the conviction, seven years after the expiration of the sentence. 
    We think this process would... does undercut finality and the credibility of the system. 
    We would encourage the Court to send the matter back with the clear expression that any challenge that may be brought is through the 1978 sentence rather than as directly against the '58 conviction. 
    That concludes my presentation.
