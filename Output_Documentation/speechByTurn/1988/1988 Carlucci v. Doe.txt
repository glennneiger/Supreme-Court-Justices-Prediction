    We'll hear argument next in No. 87-751, Frank C. Carlucci v. John Doe. 
    Mr. Kellogg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="0.000" stopTime="200.462">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Every employee of the National Security Agency has to have a high level security clearance. 
    That is a statutory requirement for employment at NSA. 
    The question at issue in this case is not what happens to an employee who loses his clearance, for it is clear that he has to be removed. 
    Nor is the question whether the clearance decision itself is subject to judicial review. 
    The application of this Court's decisions in Egan and Webster v. Doe will remain open on remand. 
    The question at issue today is simply what procedures are to be followed by the agency in removing an employee who loses his clearance. 
    After briefly stating the background of this case, I will argue that there are three different ways to remove the employee, and the agency is charged with choosing the appropriate procedure in light of the individual circumstances. 
    First, the employee can be removed for cause for failure to maintain a required clearance after following all the ordinary procedures afforded to Federal employees dismissed for cause, including MSPB review if the employee is a preference eligible veteran. 
    Second, the employee can be suspended and then removed under the summary procedures of 5 U.S.C. 7532 following notice in a hearing if the Secretary of Defense determines that the suspension and the removal are in the interests of national security. 
    Finally, the employee can be removed without any procedures whatsoever under 50 U.S.C. 833 if the Secretary of Defense determines that that action is in the interest of the United States and that none of the other procedures can be invoked consistently with national security. 
    Well, Respondent was employed at the National Security Agency from 1968 until 1984. 
    In 1982 he disclosed to NSA security officials that while on vacation in foreign countries, he had engaged in homosexual relations with foreign nationals. 
    He subsequently received a notice of proposed removal on the grounds that his continued access to classified information was no longer clearly consistent with the national security. 
    Pursuant to NSA regulations governing for-cause removals, he was advised that he had a right to respond, to obtain counsel. 
    He was kept on paid status pending the outcome of his case, but was denied access to classified information. 
    Respondent requested and received a psychiatric evaluation in an effort to demonstrate that he did not pose a security risk. 
    A board of appraisal was convened to consider his case. 
    Based on the psychiatric report and Respondent's own statements, the board concluded that Respondent had shown poor judgment, that he was emotionally unstable and that he was living beyond his means. 
    Accordingly, the board concluded that he was a poor security risk and recommended that his clearance be revoked.

    What authority was the Secretary... or the agency acting under at this stage?

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    They were acting under dual authority. 
    The board of appraisal is provided for by statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="213.289" stopTime="221.395">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but when the... when the agency first took action against him and started this procedure, what did it purport to act under?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="221.395" stopTime="237.070">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    It was acting under its statutory authority to hire employees without regard to the Civil Service laws. 
    That authority puts NSA employees in the excepted service for purposes of the Civil Service Reform Act. 
    Now--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="237.070" stopTime="243.824">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the agency had issued regulations?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="249.045" stopTime="257.984">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --Yes. 
    The agency has issued regulations instituting that authority and, in fact, circumscribing its otherwise uncircumscribed authority--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="257.984" stopTime="260.270">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that is what they were acting under? 
    Their own regulations?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="260.270" stopTime="279.231">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --That's correct. 
    NSA has provided by regulation that NSA employees can only be removed for cause, and it has provided procedural protections to be used for for-cause removals including notice and opportunity to respond and be represented by counsel. 
    It is those procedures that were invoked in this case.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Kellogg, would you tell me what is the NSA regulation that required that the removal be for cause?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="286.837" stopTime="289.622">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Chapter 370--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="289.622" stopTime="290.589">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's 370.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="290.589" stopTime="299.811">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --of the NSA regulations says that removals are to be for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="299.811" stopTime="303.013">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And is that... is 370 in the appendix of the cert petition?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="303.013" stopTime="304.215">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="304.215" stopTime="319.475">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Kellogg, doesn't Chapter 371 of the regulations say that it applies to actions to limit access to classified information and to suspend or terminate personnel for reasons of national security?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="319.475" stopTime="320.591">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct, Justice O'Connor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="320.591" stopTime="336.334">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It looked to me reading through it, frankly, like this was a 371 proceeding or should have been. 
    Maybe they proceeded under 370, but were they violating their own regulations in doing that?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="336.334" stopTime="357.850">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    No, they were not, Justice O'Connor. 
    Chapter 371 implements procedures for clearing access of employees to classified information. 
    And it's correct that the clearance portion of what happened to Respondent took place pursuant to Chapter 371. 
    But once the clearance is revoked, the question is how is the employee to be removed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="357.850" stopTime="360.116">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then it becomes cause.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="360.116" stopTime="388.452">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    And then it becomes cause because possession of a clearance is a statutory requirement of employment at NSA. 
    Chapter 371 provides an alternative mechanism for removing the employee. 
    It implements 5 U.S.C. 7532, which permits the employee to be summarily suspended without pay and then subsequently removed if the director or if the head of the agency determines that it's in the interest of national security.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="388.452" stopTime="393.856">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I was a little troubled because reading the regulations, it did seem to me that they just didn't follow their own regulations.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="393.856" stopTime="421.637">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Well, I think that's not correct. 
    They were, in fact, very careful to state precisely which portion of the regulations they were following. 
    There are different paths here and which path you take depends upon the language you use in notifying the employee. 
    If they had said we propose to suspend and remove you in the interest of national security pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7532, then they would have had to follow 371.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="421.637" stopTime="428.391">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, you say this is not a national security case as defined in the preamble to the regulations.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="428.391" stopTime="519.634">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct. 
    It's certainly true that national security is implicated. 
    The reason he lost his clearance is that it was no longer clearly consistent with the national security for him to have a clearance. 
    But the reason he was removed was for cause for failure to satisfy his statutory condition of his employment. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals held that the authority of the Director of NSA to remove employees for cause is circumscribed by 5 U.S.C. 7532 which the court says expressly controls terminations in the interest of national security. 
    And we think the Court of Appeals reversed the proper relation between 7532 and ordinary for-cause procedures. 
    Seventy-five thirty-two by its own terms is an optional, not a mandatory, procedure. 
    It states that the Secretary may suspend and remove an employee pursuant to its procedures, but it does purport to lay down a mandatory procedure for every case. 
    It also says that 7532 can be used notwithstanding other statutes, but nothing precludes actions taken pursuant to other statutes. 
    And this reference to other statutes only makes sense... is referring to provisions like the CSRA that provide protections in ordinary for-cause removals that are not available under the summary procedures of 7532.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="519.634" stopTime="523.836">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Kellogg, may I ask you another question? 
    Seventy-five thirty-two says you may suspend without pay.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="523.836" stopTime="524.686">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="524.686" stopTime="527.804">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does it... is every 7532 suspension one without pay?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="527.804" stopTime="530.858">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Well, I don't think it would have to be.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="530.858" stopTime="531.591">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Because this one was not.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="531.591" stopTime="552.186">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    The statute seems to contemplate that. 
    For example, in part B, it says you remove... you can only suspended an employee. 
    And that would seem to indicate that the suspension is what starts the whole process going. 
    But if the agency were to choose to suspend him with pay or merely to suspend access to classified information, I don't think anybody would object.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="552.186" stopTime="563.410">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    They might not object, but they wouldn't be following the statute if they did that. 
    It seems to me that this is something... and doesn't the agency head himself have to do the... invoke this procedure?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="563.410" stopTime="568.345">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct. 
    The head of the agency has to make the decision himself.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="568.345" stopTime="571.581">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, okay.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="571.581" stopTime="592.930">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    The point is that Section 7532 is not an employee protection statute. 
    It sets minimum standards to be used in suspending and removing employees. 
    Whether the agency could go beyond those in using 7532 is an open question, but not particularly germane to the question at issue.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="592.930" stopTime="596.881">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Under 7532, isn't the ultimate decision the Secretary rather than the agency?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="596.881" stopTime="604.301">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Yes. 
    The head of the agency has to make the ultimate decision. 
    Now, subsequent to the Court of Appeals' decision in this case--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="604.301" stopTime="609.270">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the Secretary doesn't get into the act under the for-cause--

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --No, that's correct. 
    The Secretary does not. 
    Subsequent to the Court of Appeals' decision in this case, the Director of NSA was designated by executive order as the head of an agency for purposes of 7532. 
    So, in any subsequent cases, the Director himself would be making the decision, not the Secretary of Defense.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="631.202" stopTime="635.737">

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="636.270" stopTime="641.224">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, he did that because under the Court of Appeals' holding, that's all he could do--

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct.

    Yes.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="648.330" stopTime="656.618">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    And so, it would have to go back and he would have to do it again under 7532 or under 833. 
    That's an option as well.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="656.618" stopTime="663.256">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But 833 has got that condition on its use that none of the other procedures would be adequate.

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct. 
    It states... it's sort of the most extreme, the most restrictive provision.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="668.993" stopTime="673.629">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But what has happened here already would seem to indicate you never could satisfy that condition.

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Not that you could never satisfy it.

    Yes.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="677.481" stopTime="680.718">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    There could certainly be cases in which 833 would be appropriate. 
    For example--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="680.718" stopTime="684.337">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I agree with that, but in this case, I don't see how you could ever use 833.

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --Oh, I don't think 833 would be appropriate in this case. 
    I don't really think 7532 would be appropriate either unless--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="691.407" stopTime="694.709">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, 833 is really an emergency dismissal provision.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="694.709" stopTime="696.561">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --That's correct, as is--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="696.561" stopTime="699.013">

    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --No, we do not have an emergency. 
    Section 7532 is an emergency provision as well. 
    The legislative history of 7532 focused on the Lloyd-La Follette Act and the Veteran's Preference Act and the procedures provided to Federal employees dismissed for cause under that statute. 
    It said this procedure is necessary in certain extreme and emergency circumstances to cut through--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="724.212" stopTime="726.163">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    --That's correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="726.663" stopTime="732.067">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And your position is that it also is only an emergency provision that's not applicable here.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="732.067" stopTime="753.981">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Well, I'm not saying that it couldn't have been used here. 
    Certainly NSA's mission is so sensitive that any employee for whom it is not clearly consistent with the national security for him to have a clearance, it is probably also in the interest of national security to remove that employee. 
    But I think the three provisions--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="753.981" stopTime="763.503">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What were you suggesting when you answered Justice White earlier? 
    That there might have to be a remand for reconsideration under 7532?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="763.503" stopTime="770.157">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --If the Court of Appeals were upheld.

    You have to go back and do it again under 7532.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="770.157" stopTime="784.833">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But really there's a different standard under 7532 than there is under the National Security Agency. 
    In order to invoke that emergency... not the super emergency, 833, but the regular emergency... it has to be necessary in the interest of national security.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="784.833" stopTime="785.517">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Kellogg, you know you're going to be arguing in another case that it's not consistent with national security to give access to classified information to someone as to whom it is not clearly consistent that he can have that information. 
    I mean, the two really boil down to the same.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="822.338" stopTime="836.181">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --Well, no, I don't think they do. 
    For example, in a number of agencies, you don't even have to have a clearance necessarily to work in that agency. 
    Every employee at NSA has to have a security clearance.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="836.181" stopTime="852.608">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but where you have a security clearance, I'm sure you would say that unless someone clearly can be trusted with access to the classified information, it's not... it's necessary in the interest of national security not to let him have that classified information.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="852.608" stopTime="939.748">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    Well, I think that might well follow, Justice Scalia. 
    The three statutory procedures for removing employees in these circumstances form sort of a pyramid where the for-cause procedures are the base and cover the broadest ground. 
    Then comes Section 7532, and finally the smallest compass and the most extreme case, Section 833. 
    The lines of demarcation between those procedures are not clear-cut, and much is left to the discretion of the agency to choose which one is appropriate in an individual case, but as a general principle, the for-cause procedures are to be used unless there's some reason why they shouldn't be used such as, for example, the employee can't be told the precise reasons why he's being removed. 
    Perhaps it would reveal a source of information that must remain secret. 
    In those circumstances, Section 7532 would be appropriate because it provides for a statement of reasons only to the extent that national security permits; whereas, under the for-cause procedures you have to give him a complete statement of reasons. 
    The premise of the Court of Appeals' decision and of Respondent's argument appears to be that he would have received more procedures under 7532 than he received under the for-cause procedures.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="939.748" stopTime="941.465">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    xxx Secretary's decision.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="941.465" stopTime="998.121">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct. 
    The Secretary of Defense, under the prior procedures would have been involved if 7532 had been invoked, but he would also have been suspended without pay for 16 months. 
    He would have received notice only to the extent consistent with the national security. 
    He would have had no right to counsel. 
    He would have had a single hearing of unspecified scope. 
    And if a decision were made to remove him, he would have been ineligible for any other position in the Department of Defense and for any other job elsewhere in government without OPM specifically saying that he's eligible. 
    Now, that contrasts sharply with what he actually received, which was 16 months of pay, notice and opportunity to respond, counsel, several layers of intra-agency review, including a personal meeting with the Director of NSA and a recommendation that the agency try to find his employment elsewhere where a clearance was not required.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="998.121" stopTime="1000.287">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    When did his pay stop?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="1000.287" stopTime="1137.195">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    His pay stopped on the date of his removal when the final decision was made by the Director of NSA. 
    The only person who would be better off if Section 7532 became the standard means for removing people who lose their security clearance is Respondent because he got all the other procedures. 
    Everybody else would be worse off. 
    There are any number of reasons why the agency might determine that someone's access to classified information is no longer clearly consistent with the national security. 
    It could depend on a number of mundane factors such as financial problems, alcohol abuse, mental health concerns, carelessness in the handling of classified material, or simply that a family member has close ties with a hostile country. 
    Now, in all of those circumstances, the employee may lose his clearance and his job at NSA because NSA cannot tolerate any unnecessary risk. 
    Its mission is too sensitive. 
    But we're still dealing in those cases with a fairly run-of-the-mine clearance determination, not an emergency such that the procedures of 7532 have to be invoked. 
    There will, unfortunately, be more dangerous cases from time to time in which an employee has to be excluded from access to classified information and removed immediately and in which perhaps he can't be given a full statement of the reasons. 
    In those cases, Section 7532 or even Section 833 would be appropriate. 
    But it's important to note that it's in the agency's own interest to provide its employees with as much protection as possible to avoid any arbitrary or unnecessary removals and to give the employee himself a sense that he's being treated fairly because a disgruntled ex-employee with classified information poses a grave security risk. 
    The ultimate irony of the Court of Appeals' decision is that it seems to mandate a more severe procedure than the agency itself would want to use. 
    Unless there are any further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Kellogg. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Gill. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John G. Gill, Jr.
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1140.311" stopTime="1272.462">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We respectfully submit that the decision by the District of Columbia Circuit be affirmed because of the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, a pertinent executive order, the pertinent Department of Defense directive, NSA's own regulations, and the clear mandate of this Court's trilogy of security cases in the 1950's, Cole v. Young, Vitarelli v. Seaton, and Service v. Dulles, which we submit mandate calling a security case a security case. 
    First of all, I need to emphasize that the mandatory procedures that are at issue in this case are keyed to removal or termination. 
    Much is made in the government's papers about suspension, and that, indeed, is discretionary when you're dealing with security risks, tactical decisions as to whether to suspend now or perhaps watch a person and see what's happening are proper. 
    But... and I think this is the answer to Justice Stevens' question about was he suspended without pay and is that a mandatory procedure to trigger these rights. 
    The suspension is discretionary, but once you get to removal, these procedures are mandatory. 
    And the mere fact that the government paid him for some more months should not, we submit, obviate his congressionally mandated head-of-agency review rights. 
    And as is conceded, this was a termination case from the very beginning. 
    And in the words of 7532(3), an employee is entitled to the following procedures before removal. 
    And as the D.C. Circuit held, we were entitled, we complain, about not receiving a hearing at the agency authority duly constituted for this purpose, a review of the case by the head of the agency or his designee, and a written statement of the decision by the agency head.

    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We contend that when you terminate in the interest of national security, which I'll get to the record and why this case is such a case, these rights are mandated. 
    We disagree with the mere option argument of the government. 
    When you have a security case, as this is, a termination in the interest of national security, these rights are mandated by Congress.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1350.795" stopTime="1354.447">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand that's your position. 
    All I'm saying is the plain language of the statute doesn't say that. 
    That's all.
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1354.447" stopTime="1428.895">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    Well, we point out in the... most of our record references are to the Court of Appeals' appendix, which we understand has been filed with the Clerk and circulated to the Justices. 
    The initial notice at Court of Appeals 82 started out: 
    "This is a notice to remove you from your critical, sensitive position. " 
    Our point is that it was a removal on national security grounds from the very beginning. 
    The government's entire for-cause argument depends on Chapter 370, which is their inherent authority for-cause procedures. 
    And, of course, the simplest answer to this, as Justice O'Connor has already pointed out, is it... they didn't use the 370 standards. 
    Three seventy point three, which is found at Court of Appeals' Appendix 67, Subsection 3-2 reads: 
    "This section does not apply to a suspension or removal taken in the interest of national security. " 
    The government's position is anomalous in the light of Chapter 371.1. 
    That's at Court of Appeals' Appendix 228. 
    "This chapter prescribes policies and procedures governing actions to limit access to-- "
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1428.895" stopTime="1433.283">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Excuse me. 
    You wouldn't have the references to the... to the petition rather than the Court of Appeals--
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1433.283" stopTime="1530.761">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    --This is not in the petition. 
    I think this may be found in our brief in opposition to certiorari. 
    We set out 371... and I think that's at 12(b). 
    No, I'm sorry. 
    That's at 10(b) of our opposition to certiorari. 
    And the very first, 1.1 says: 
    "This chapter prescribes policies and procedures governing actions to limit access to classified information, suspend or terminate civilian personnel of NSA for reasons of national security. " 
    Now, this is very important language because the government's argument seems to intertwine cause with the taking away of a security clearance, the taking away of access to classified information. 
    This preamble to 371 says 371 applies when you either terminate or circumscribe someone's access to classified information. 
    So, by NSA's own regulation, this is the procedure that's to be used, and this procedure later on mandates the 7532 procedures: appeal to the agency head, hearing by a duly constituted board, and a decision by the Secretary of Defense. 
    So, by its own regulation, 370 which they rely on is not applicable. 
    Three seventy-one, whether you consider it a mere taking away of a security clearance... they have to use 371 before they get to cause.

    "Reviewed and readjudicated" in the words of the executive order.

    Three seventy sets up the familiar standard for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. 
    And that's in Section 3-4. 
    That was never utilized. 
    We never heard that term until we got to this Court.

    For-cause as it would promote the efficiency of the service. 
    There was a talismanic incantation of 370 a few times at the administrative level, but it was always whether his continued access to SCI's, classified information--

    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr.

    --Talismanic incantation for the good of the service instead of a talismanic incantation of 370.
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1658.641" stopTime="1684.956">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    No. 
    I asked this Court to follow the mandate of Cole v. Young, Vitarelli v. Seaton. 
    Is it really a security case? 
    What test was used? 
    The test was the 371 test. 
    Is his access clearly consistent with the interest of national security, which we respectfully submit, is the test in 7532. 
    Never did they use the 370 test even though they said that term, that number. 
    They never said for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1684.956" stopTime="1719.744">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But 371 covers not only policies and procedures to terminate civilian personnel for reasons of national security, it also prescribes policies and procedures governing access... governing actions to limit access to classified information. 
    And what the government says it was using 371 for, as I understand it, is to say that this person is not entitled to classified information. 
    Since he is not entitled to classified information, it is in the good of the service that he not hold his job. 
    Why isn't that an adequate explanation of the use of 371?
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1719.744" stopTime="1734.770">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    Because, Your Honor, I heard that for the first time in this Court. 
    And I'm very familiar with the record. 
    You will not find in the record any mention of 371. 
    That was never utilized. 
    I mean, the standard was utilized, but they never acknowledged they were utilizing it. 
    If you use 371--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1734.770" stopTime="1744.144">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So, for that, they did the wrong talisman. 
    That one they did use the standard and didn't use the number. 
    The other one you were complaining about, they did use the number, but didn't use the standard.
speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="1744.144" stopTime="2044.086">
    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    --Well, Your Honor, yes, they used the 371 standard. 
    My point is that when you use 371, you get your 7532 procedures. 
    That's in that regulation, and it mandates review at the Secretary of Defense level, which is why we're here. 
    So, the fact that they used the 371 standard is very important. 
    That gives us these rights that we think Congress gave us. 
    If I could refer to the initial letter. 
    It had the standard of... it's not your... your continued employment is not clearly consistent with the national security. 
    They then convened a board of appraisal. 
    Under the 1964 legislation, a purely security procedure, which deals with or impanels people who are... have expertise in the area of security and advises on national security matters. 
    And that body found that his access to classified information was clearly... clearly not consistent with national security. 
    Most significant is the Director of NSA's own decision. 
    It's at 192 of the Court of Appeals' record, and I quote paragraph C. 
    "Doe's record on the job evidences proper security awareness, but his lifestyle away from work is not similarly acceptable. " 
    We feel that under the for-cause standard promoting the efficiency of the service, this is almost a finding that it does not impair the efficiency of the service because his on-the-job performance is acceptable. 
    He then goes on. 
    "I find much attractive about Doe and his work record and performance. " 
    "I also find him significantly flawed in his off-duty behavior and a potential security risk. " 
    This was a security case. 
    This was not a for-cause case. 
    And when you... when it is a case in the interest of national security, the government has to contend with Executive Order 10450. 
    President Eisenhower, 1953. 
    We have cited in our papers and the government in its reply brief has quoted Section 6. 
    Now, this is at 250 of the Court of Appeals' appendix. 
    Section 6 deals with the discretionary nature of suspensions. 
    And Executive Order 10450 is by its terms more broad than 7532. 
    Section 5, which is unrebutted in the reply brief, is mandatory in nature and mandates the 7532 procedures for any and all terminations in the interest of national security. 
    "Whenever there is developed information indicating the retention of employment may not be clearly consistent with the interest of national security, such information shall be forwarded to the head of the employing department or agency who shall review or cause to be reviewed and, where necessary, readjudicate in accordance with the Act of August 26, 1950. " 
    That is 5 U.S.C. 7532, which the Court of Appeals held we were entitled to. 
    Why does the NSA regulations and the executive order seem to indicate that 7532 rights were mandated? 
    We feel that back in the early 1950's, when the executive order came into being, when this legislation was passed, there was great concern... the Korean War, the cold war... about security risks. 
    There was also a great concern about witch hunts in government employment. 
    People wrongfully, frivolously being ferreted out as national security risks without basis. 
    We've set out at length the legislative history at pages 23 to 34 of our brief, both of the 1950 Act and the 1964 Act. 
    We have done that in footnote fashion. 
    On the whole, it clearly shows that the District of Columbia Circuit was right in this case. 
    There was a legislative compromise. 
    A part, a significant portion of Congress, wanted civil service review for the protection of employees. 
    Another part of Congress wanted additional power, not emergency power. 
    This is not an emergency act, although I can see it does away with outside the agency review, but greater power to the Secretary to terminate in the interests of national security. 
    A compromise was reached. 
    The politically responsible, often Cabinet-level officer, accountable to the President, accountable to Congress who could be called down to legislative hearings to say, what's happening in your agency, why are there so many employees being terminated, why do you have security leaks there. 
    a high level that would show an impartial tribunal, not the people who were trying to get rid of the employee anyway, but someone removed but, again, consistent with the values preserved in this Court's decision in Egan where there will not be outside the agency substantive review for a security clearance.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2044.086" stopTime="2058.512">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you think Congress intended as a regular matter, whenever there's a security problem, including a clearance problem like this for security information, that the head of the agency is going to be spending his time case by case determining these matters? 
    I think that--

    I think that at best is a mandate of Congress or an intent of Congress to say we want to make it clear. 
    There is no review of the extraordinary emergency power in 833. 
    No other statutes will get in the way of it. 
    I don't think you can read what the government read in that there exists an option. 
    In fact, the D.C. Court of Appeals took just... I mean, the D.C. Circuit took just the converse. 
    They said the mere mention of 7532 shows that they had to remove that to demonstrate that 833... that 7532 was not mandated.

    And if you look at the legislative history of that Act, the 1964 Act, you see Congressmen saying as long as this new legislation doesn't get in the way of the ordinary appeal rights. 
    And we've set that out by way of footnote in our brief. 
    To analyze the competing contentions in this case, the government argues that you have a general power to terminate which is inherent from the power to hire. 
    And they can use it if they rely on it. 
    We argue that Congress has given a specific focus to national security cases of termination in the interests of national security, and in those cases there shall be these procedural reviews.

    Mr. John G. Gill, Jr. 
    Well, I was assured. 
    It was the Solicitor General's idea, and I was assured it was distributed. 
    I'm sorry. 
    But in most brief... both briefs, most of the references are to that. 
    But that is the delegation of authority under the '59 Act from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of NSA.

    And this is the delegation of authority in this regard from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of NSA pursuant to this Act. 
    And clearly, if we use principles of the English grammar, when something set off by commas, he withheld to himself the power to terminate the services of an employee in the interests of national security for positions at NSA. 
    And this defeats totally the government's argument on inherent authority because of In re Hennen and all of those cases say the power is inherent unless circumscribed by regulatory... we think it's also a recognition of the congressional mandate. 
    The principle we espouse here is not a startling one, we respectfully submit. 
    And that is when there's a specific focus on legislation that overcomes and overrules general inherent powers, then you have to follow those procedures.

    "such other agency of the Government of the United States as the President designates in the best interest of national security. "

   Rebuttal of Michael K. Kellogg
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="2924.480" stopTime="2981.466">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    In the Court's decision in Cole v. Young, the Court compared 7532... situations in which use of that statute was appropriate with ordinary removal procedures. 
    And the Court stated quite clearly: 
    "In the absence of an immediate threat of harm to the national security, the normal dismissal procedures seem fully adequate and the justification for summary powers disappears. " 
    Now, the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, which have wide responsibility for Federal personnel matters, also stated in the Egan case that the existence of Section 7532 does not affect the availability of for-cause removal procedures whenever the cause might implicate national security. 
    In lieu--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2981.466" stopTime="3003.565">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Part of Mr. Gill's argument, Mr. Kellogg, is that even if you could have proceeded under one of these other provisions, you didn't. 
    And I must say he does seem to make a point that you were proceeding under 371 which is not the for-cause removal procedure. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3003.565" stopTime="3063.937">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    --I think actually the agency was very careful in choosing the procedures that it followed here. 
    The notice of proposed removal to Respondent stated: your... 
    "it appears that your continued access to classified information is no longer consistent with the national security. " 
    "Therefore, you no longer meet a requirement of employment at NSA. " 
    "Therefore, you will be removed under Chapter 370. " 
    Now, it's true that the notice didn't say under the for-cause standard of Chapter 370, but Chapter 370 only allows removals for a cause. 
    The agency was quite careful to follow the 370 procedures. 
    Now, there are separate procedures under 371 for implementing Section 7532, but the agency did not follow the 7532 procedures for removals and dismissals in the interests of national security.

    But it's also true that Section 371 in its introductory sentence says: 
    "It purports to prescribe policies and procedures governing actions to limit access to classified information. " 
    That seems to support your opponent's view that that section governs the procedure for taking away a security clearance.

    It would only support the proponent's... the opponent's view if it followed that once you revoke a clearance, you have to continue and can only use Section 7532. 
    Now, it's true that Chapter 371 implements the statutory authorization for using boards of appraisals to assess whether a person should have access to classified information. 
    And a board of appraisal was used in this case and determined that Respondent's access was no longer clearly consistent with the national security. 
    Therefore, his clearance was revoked.

    So, are you saying that insofar as they went through the revocation of access procedure, they did follow 371? 
    They didn't violate it. 
    But then when they removed him, they were following 370?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3125.058" stopTime="3143.416">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct. 
    And there's nothing in the regulations that precludes that. 
    In fact, it would be quite extraordinary if NSA in its own regulations were to bind its hands and give itself only the option of using the emergency procedure whenever a clearance is revoked.

    You maintain that you carefully tailored it for 371, but you never mention 371.

    Well, did you carefully not mention 371?
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3159.212" stopTime="3167.901">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    I don't recall if 371 is specifically mentioned. 
    A board of appraisal was convened.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He said it wasn't mentioned.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3169.817" stopTime="3207.090">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's true. 
    Respondent said that. 
    I'm frankly not sure if anywhere in the record there is or is not a mention of Chapter 371. 
    A board of appraisal was convened, and a board of appraisal is permitted under the procedures of Chapter 371, but the removal took place under Chapter 370. 
    And the fact that a procedure exists under 371 for removing an employee summarily, when it's necessary in the interest of national security, does not affect whether loss of a clearance is cause for removal.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3207.090" stopTime="3245.898">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but unfortunately this combination of 370 and 371 is contradicted by the very first section of 371 which reads: 
    "Scope. " 
    "This chapter prescribes policies and procedures governing actions to limit access to classified information, suspend and/or terminate civilian personnel of the NSA, Central Security Service, for reasons of national security. " 
    "Such actions for reasons other than national. " 
    --other than national... 
    "security are processed in accordance with Chapter 370. " 
    And yet, you purport to be going under 371 and 370. 
    I mean--
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3245.898" stopTime="3247.817">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3247.817" stopTime="3255.804">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --this thing says it's a dichotomy. 
    If it's for national security, it's under 371; if it's other than national security, it's under 370.
speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="3255.804" stopTime="3357.686">
    Mr. Michael K. Kellogg 
    No. 
    If it's implementing Chapter 75... or Section 7532, then you have to follow the procedures in Chapter 371. 
    Counsel is quite correct that the delegation of authority to the Director of NSA specifically withheld the power to suspend and terminate employees in the interest of national security pursuant to 7532. 
    As a consequence, NSA had to develop separate procedures for suspensions and removals in the interest of national security. 
    But a removal for cause is something quite different, and nothing in Chapter 371 says that loss of a clearance cannot be cause for removal. 
    But also a note to follow up on Justice White's point. 
    The District Court was faced with the question of whether NSA followed its procedures in this case. 
    It found that it did, that the removal comported with NSA regulations. 
    The Court of Appeals, in light of its statutory holding, did not reach that question. 
    If the Court is troubled by the regulatory question but wishes to reverse on the statutory question, the Court could remand to the Court of Appeals for... to address the question of whether NSA followed its own regulations. 
    But the NSA regulations have been in place since the inception of NSA, and removals time and again take place for cause after revocation of a clearance. 
    The agency's own interpretation of its regulations is surely entitled to some deference. 
    Unless there are any further questions--
