    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument next in Number 87-1387, Wards Cove Packing Company v. Frank Atonio. 
    Mr. Fryer, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    This Court has granted certiorari to review three important questions. 
    I would like to discuss the questions in the order presented in the petition. 
    The first question really goes to the heart of this case. 
    And that is, whether comparative statistics, which show only a racial imbalance in the work force are to be preferred as a matter of law, over the trial court findings of fact as to the relevant labor market. 
    There is a stark contrast between these two measurements. 
    Petitioner's labor market analysis is widely used in civil rights litigation and it has been backed by every level of the federal judiciary, including this Court. 
    It is explicitly adopted by the very EEOC guidelines which are relied upon by the Respondents in their brief. 
    Indeed, it is ironic that in order to prevail in this case, the Respondents, and the amicus supporting them, are urging this Court, to urge as a matter of law that one of the most formidable tools that we have to measure employment discrimination, namely the labor market analysis, is to be discarded.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="148.998" stopTime="161.457">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say, Mr. Fryer, that your labor market analysis is approved by the EEOC. 
    Can you give us a couple of sentence description as to what your labor market analysis is?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="161.457" stopTime="184.892">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    The labor market analysis was based upon the one percent sample from the Census. 
    It was drawn from the large geographic areas, where the employees were drawn from... from the western United States, in the areas that supplied people for this industry... Alaska, Oregon, Washington, and California.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="184.892" stopTime="200.862">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Fryer, I gather the district court relied on your expert's suggestion of just using Census data for a very wide area of the Pacific Northwest--
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="200.862" stopTime="201.503">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    That is correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="201.503" stopTime="203.015">

    --as the relevant labor market?

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    That is correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="203.793" stopTime="225.819">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, the Ninth Circuit rejected that and relied upon the pool of workers... the cannery workers themselves... and a more restricted pool and said that was determinative, is that correct?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="225.819" stopTime="226.510">

    That is correct.

    The internal labor force, including the cannery workers.

    Including the cannery workers.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="239.807" stopTime="248.794">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, if we were to reject the Ninth Circuit's view of the appropriate pool, we then go back to what the district court found?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="248.794" stopTime="249.665">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="249.665" stopTime="281.695">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And even your expert said that the figure should not include college professors and construction workers and other groups which are not reasonably available for the jobs at issue. 
    And yet, the district court accepted that Census data, even though your own expert said some of these groups shouldn't be included. 
    So what do we do with that? 
    What if we think the district court erred, too?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="281.695" stopTime="286.159">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Well, first that is a finding of fact. 
    It has never been challenged. 
    It is clearly erroneous.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="286.159" stopTime="288.920">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So, we just accept it?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="288.920" stopTime="336.700">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    I think the Court should just accept it. 
    And a person could, If they wished, get Into the nuances, the evidentiary nuances as to why or why not some of this labor market analysis might or might not apply In a given situation. 
    But you see, with the broad numbers, and the various methods that Dr. Roes took into consideration... It really doesn't make any difference and those are credibility arguments. 
    The attacks on the statistics are credibility arguments. 
    The Respondents did not challenge those findings under the clearly erroneous standard. 
    They challenged those findings as a matter of law. 
    And--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="336.700" stopTime="343.666">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And, and the Ninth Circuit said, as a matter of law, the relevant pool is all the workers?

    The labor market.
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="375.287" stopTime="383.431">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Yes. 
    The discrete finding of fact is finding of fact number 123, of the trial court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="383.431" stopTime="395.389">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What would you do... would you take the cannery and non-cannery workers together to compare with the labor force... market statistics, or would you do them separately?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="395.389" stopTime="519.211">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Well, you do them separately but you do them separately for a distinctive reason and that is the cannery workers are a part of this labor force, tills labor supply for the entire industry. 
    And I think that is one of the ways the Ninth Circuit seemed to get off track here. 
    You have to look at the labor supply as a whole. 
    Now, there is a very small slice of that labor supply that is represented by Local 37 of the ILWU. 
    That is the union that has the contract for jurisdiction over particular jobs. 
    Now, now the way this industry operates... you have to understand the way the industry operates to understand the statistics. 
    I think the error of the Ninth Circuit was a misunderstanding of the industry which the trial court apparently understood very well. 
    Now, the way that people are hired in this industry, first you have to start with the basics. 
    The canneries are located in remote areas of Alaska, that is a given fact. 
    The seasons are short. 
    They are very intense. 
    There is no time during the season to train skilled people. 
    Once that cannery is in operation and the fish are coming in, the fish have got to be canned. 
    That season is over in from three weeks to two months. 
    As soon as the canning stops, the cannery workers go home, the rest of the workers put the cannery away and then everybody is terminated and they return to their homes. 
    Now, over the winter months, the employer faced with this industrial situation has determined that since he doesn't have time during the season to train people for the skilled jobs, he has got to look to a labor market for those jobs. 
    And it is a given fact that he has to deal with that that labor market is 10 percent non-white and 90 percent white. 
    That is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="519.211" stopTime="529.779">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That is if you say the relevant market is the whole Pacific Northwest and you rely on Census data. 
    This is a disparate impact cases right?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="529.779" stopTime="530.400">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --That is correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="530.400" stopTime="571.286">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, in such a case, do you think that the use of a particular hiring channel or market can be a facially neutral practice that is subject to disparate impact analysis? 
    Suppose there is an employer who has the factory, in let's say the Harlem section of New York, and that employer chooses to do all of his hiring out in Westchester County, and the result is largely a white work force. 
    Now, is that a practice subject to disparate impact analysis?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="571.286" stopTime="574.847">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Well, it certainly could be subject to disparate treatment analysis.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="574.847" stopTime="576.809">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That is not my question.
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="576.809" stopTime="577.330">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Yes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="577.330" stopTime="594.682">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And if sot what does the Court do? 
    Is the Court's first task to draw an ideal market out of which the employer must draw the work force as a means of testing it; is that the first step?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="594.682" stopTime="629.533">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --Well, perhaps, perhaps I could answer it this way... for disparate impact we have got to have some... disparate impact analysis is statistical. 
    It has got to be statistical on some basis. 
    So, we have to look to some objective measure to judge the employer's practice. 
    And then the question is what is that measure? 
    Our case is not a situation where we look to a discrete area dominated by whites. 
    That is not the situation. 
    We look to broad areas in the western United States.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="629.533" stopTime="639.769">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what does the plaintiff have to go and how does the Court get into it on a disparate impact analysis; that is what we have. 
    What does the plaintiff have to show for the market?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="639.769" stopTime="647.325">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    The plaintiff has to develop some measure of the employment practices, obviously.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="647.325" stopTime="652.158">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This Plaintiff says, we want to look just at the in-house work force.
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="652.158" stopTime="671.943">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    At the internal work force, yes. 
    And our position is that that is not really relevant. 
    That the internal work force is only a small measure of this overall labor market. 
    You seer it takes months to fill the at-issue jobs.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, but this is now a disparate impact case, and I, I gather from the briefs that the respondents say somehow that if you are right that there was no discriminatory treatment, that the assignment according to neutral principles, nevertheless has a discriminatory impact. 
    It treats them worse, because they are minorities.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --Well, I, I think that the argument is yes, yes, that there is impact. 
    But it is brought up in the context of how those practices may affect the hiring and that is the way that the court of appeals--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="889.173" stopTime="894.727">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you think that is all... that there is nothing left, in and of itself, on these other claims?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="894.727" stopTime="900.571">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --That is the way that the court of appeals appeared to address it in its last opinion. 
    It said that--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="900.571" stopTime="909.108">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did the Respondents ever press those claims as status claims, employee status claims, independent of hiring?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="909.108" stopTime="999.737">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --They did press them as status claims and the district court analyzed those claims under the disparate impact model as well as the treatment model and it found business necessity for the housing; it also found that the messing claims were a matter of individual taste. 
    The key on messing is the evidence that an employee could out into another mess hall if he so chose. 
    So the district court disposed of them that way and the way the court of appeals appears to have dealt with it on the third opinion is to direct the party's attention to those allegations as they may have affected hiring. 
    The court of appeals talks about how the minorities may have been deprived of the web of information but there was no evidence on that. 
    The specific finding of fact of the trial court expressly states that there was no deterrence to minorities, interns of applying for any job. 
    And, of course, that is one of the critical findings of fact of the trial court that really goes to all of these allegations. 
    The trial court made findings that there was no deterrence; that each employee was free, at any time, to apply for any job he wished; that the employees were evaluated on the basis of job-related criteria.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    We do. 
    Our position is that if you accepted the trial court's findings, and they are really not challenged, once those findings are accepted, it simply does not make any difference if you change legal theories to go to an impact analysis.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1145.282" stopTime="1157.168">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, your theory, as I understand it, is that the district court accepted as the relevant labor market this wide geographic area and the Census data showing 10 percent minority population.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1157.749" stopTime="1163.572">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in the jobs at issue, the employer hires 24 percent minority workers, in that right?

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    That is right.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So you say, gee, we are way over the numbers and the population so that you lose, as a prima facie case on disparate impact. 
    Is that-- 
    --Yes, but then they say that there are three job categories so that it works the other way even your own figures, as I remember.
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="1177.784" stopTime="1220.581">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Well, they do. 
    But, you see, all of those three job categories show is a standard deviation of more than two and less than three which is about what you would expect if you pick out about 60 job classifications. 
    You see, you figure that one in 20 times, purely by chance, you are going to have the two standard deviations. 
    Now, secondly, two standard deviations is not equal to discrimination. 
    All it infers, all it supports for an inference, is that something did not happen by chance. 
    And you see there was other evidence that the district court could consider that these things old not happen by chance.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1220.581" stopTime="1241.625">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    See, the thing that troubles me frankly, is that you are asking us to make an even more detailed, factual view of the district court's findings and the evidence, than any judge on the court of appeals was willing to make, even though they heard the case en banc. 
    No judge on the Court of Appeals bought your theory, and there were a lot of them heard the case.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Sure. 
    We are willing to take on the inertia. 
    I think the... I think the court of appeals, the last time around, was so focused on the legal theory of the subjective employment analysis being tested under the disparate impact model, that they really didn't address the facts that well.

    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, suppose I think that your description of the appropriate labor market is unrealistic because it takes... it assumes that you are dealing with people who are employable for a whole year, but it is a very distinctive kind of a character your employer is looking for... he is looking for somebody who will... needs work during the spring and is willing to take a job to go to Alaska just during the spring and not during the rest of the year. 
    Now, suppose I think for that reason that your labor market was not the correct one? 
    But I also think that your opponent's labor market was not the correct one... do you win because it is their burden to establish a labor market?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="1432.298" stopTime="1434.590">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    Yes. 
    And further,--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I thought you were going to say that.
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="1435.481" stopTime="1505.007">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    --And further, of course, if you thought that was the better source, I would respond by saying, that is a finding of fact; and we, we really should leave that kind of decision to the trial court. 
    This trial judge spent a lot of time analyzing this labor market and the various experts, and that is a fact-finding function. 
    Going to the next question... well, I would like to pause and say one thing about housing and messing, because I do think that, again, there is a lack of clarity on this. 
    The employees in the at issue jobs, more than 20 percent of whom were minorities, were housed together and fed together and they worked together, side by side. 
    Now, if it were not for this large number of minorities dispatched by Local 37, a fact over which the employers had no control--

   Argument of Abraham A. Arditi
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1557.781" stopTime="1605.583">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves patterns of segregation by race, in jobs, housing and messing at three Alaska salmon canneries, two of which are in remote locations. 
    The work is of a migrant, seasonal nature, and that means, as a practical matter, that the employer provides housing and messing facilities. 
    The segregation, as a result of that fact, completely pervades the lives of employees at the cannery. 
    What you have is, in effect, a company town, where virtually every aspect of the employee's life is dominated, and controlled and set by the employer.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1605.583" stopTime="1607.464">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What is the number of employees?
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1607.464" stopTime="1673.555">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    The total number of employees? 
    There are probably 200 at the cannery in a given year. 
    It varies depending on the fish run and it also depends on the canneries. 
    One cannery, in Ketchikan, hires a lot of employees on an as-needed basis for a day or two at a time. 
    The others don't have that option. 
    The largest department at the cannery is the cannery worker department and that is 37 percent non-white to 70 percent non-white, depending on which cannery we are talking about. 
    Despite this very heavy concentration of non-whites in this, the lowest-paying department, there are five-to-seven... again, depending on which cannery we are talking about... departments that are at least 90 percent white and many of those jobs and many of those departments have been 100 percent white for the entire case period concerning... that this litigation concerns.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1673.555" stopTime="1679.720">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your opponent says that that is because the cannery is seasonal, hired on the spot, and that the others aren't.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1679.720" stopTime="1735.536">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    They all hired for seasonal work. 
    I think that Mr. Fryer was saying, and incorrectly I might add, that the concentration of non-whites in the cannery worker jobs is due to dispatch practices of Local 37. 
    There are, for union purposes, two types of cannery workers... non-resident cannery workers who reside in the lower 48; and resident cannery workers who reside in Alaska during the rest of the year. 
    First of all, Local 37 represents only the non-cannery... non-resident cannery workers. 
    Even the hiring for the resident cannery workers, where there is no Local 37 involvement, is very heavily non-white. 
    In fact, of the five canneries that this case initially covered, the most heavily non-white cannery was Ekuk, which hires only resident cannery workers.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1735.536" stopTime="1740.430">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, the residents of Ekuk, how are they broken up by minority status?
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1740.430" stopTime="1742.741">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    How are they broken up?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1742.741" stopTime="1743.252">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1743.252" stopTime="1750.288">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    The primary minority group at Ekuk is Alaskan native. 
    And the cannery workers are almost all Alaskan native.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1750.288" stopTime="1765.117">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that seems reasonable to me. 
    I don't understand why that is a criticism of the fact that... you say you can't attribute the high minority in the cannery workers to the fact that the union sends mainly Filipinos, I gather.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1765.117" stopTime="1765.596">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1765.596" stopTime="1774.882">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because a lot of the people are hired locally, but then you tell me that the people available to be hired locally are also minority people, not Filipinos, but Alaskan natives.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1774.882" stopTime="1777.833">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    That is correct. 
    We are saying--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1777.833" stopTime="1779.726">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But why is that good for you? 
    I think that is bad for you.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1779.726" stopTime="1780.245">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    --Why is that good?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1780.245" stopTime="1786.459">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean it seems to me that this employer is doing what a reasonable employer would do... he hires who is available to be hired.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1786.459" stopTime="1805.904">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    The difference, Your Honor, is that this employer hires, in cannery worker jobs, virtually all non-whites and has other departments that pay more, substantially more, sometimes three or four times more than cannery worker jobs, that are almost all white. 
    The problem is that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1805.904" stopTime="1810.485">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Are there such skilled people available in Ekuk or these other towns? 
    Are there carpenters and so forth?
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1810.485" stopTime="1844.860">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    --There are, absolutely. 
    The recruitment of Alaska cannery workers, the Alaska natives, comes primarily in coastal villages. 
    And the cannery workers... I am sorry, the residents of those coastal villages grow up around the water. 
    They have an enormous amount of fishing and boating experience that would imminently qualify them for even the most difficult fishing jobs at the cannery and tender jobs. 
    And the tender is the vessel that brings the fish in from the fishing boat to the cannery docks. 
    So there is really no question about the availability of skilled personnel.

    The labor force is a combination of those hired and those available to be hired, and the work force is those hired.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1874.358" stopTime="1882.513">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, and the district court accepted as the relevant labor market, the whole Pacific Northwest, using Census data figures?
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="1882.513" stopTime="1925.461">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Right, and we contend that that finding was induced by three errors of law, and, as a result, is clearly erroneous. 
    We also contend that one need not make a labor force or a labor market finding because the wording of this statute here, prohibits job segregation on its face. 
    And Section 703(a)(2) just simply says that it will be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to classify, limit, or segregate employees in a way that denies them opportunities on the basis of race.

    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    --Perhaps I misspoke, when I said that it can confine its examination, I meant to the work force... namely those hired, rather than those around the cannery. 
    And it is permissible to do that simply because that is what the wording of the statute.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1991.015" stopTime="2012.960">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't see that Mr. Arditi. 
    It seems to me that you are reading out the last part of the statute. 
    You are saying that if you simply segregate in a way which would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities, that that's... that that's enough. 
    It seems to me, you have to limit, segregate, or classify because of such individual's race, color, or religion, sex or national origin?
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="2012.960" stopTime="2038.697">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Yes, I would like to explain what I understand that phrase to mean. 
    The phrase, because of such individual's race, sex or national origin appears both in Section 703(a)(1) and Section 703(a)(2). 
    All that phrase does is introduce the prohibited bases for discrimination. 
    In other words, Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, but not age, and not handicap.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2038.697" stopTime="2039.248">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="2039.248" stopTime="2049.222">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    If it meant something more, then we would have a situation where the phrase, because of which might suggest intentional discrimination, means something, in fact, different in those two sections.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2049.222" stopTime="2077.112">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but still in all, to establish that the classification has been because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, you have to get to labor market. 
    Because the mere fact that these people turned out to be segregated in jobs in this fashion doesn't mean anything. 
    It doesn't prove that they are segregated there because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, unless you can show by a statistical showing, compared to the labor market that this would be very unlikely to happen otherwise.
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="2077.112" stopTime="2144.595">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Perhaps I could emphasize the fact that this is a very unique industry. 
    We are fortunate in this case to have statistics that go all the way back to 1906 on the racial composition of people in the industry. 
    From 1906, all the way through 1978, the composition of those employed in the industry was far more heavily non-white than the racial composition of individuals in the labor market. 
    When we start with a labor market analysis and look at the racial composition of people in areas from which the employer hires, we do so, at least as Teamsters explains to us, because over time we expect the work force, absent discrimination to reflect the racial composition of the labor market. 
    We don't have a situation like this here because we know that historically that has never been true. 
    And, in fact, it is true in a number of migrant, seasonal industries that those employed in the industry are far more heavily non-white than those in the areas from which people or workers are drawn.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2144.595" stopTime="2156.604">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Couldn't have anything to do with better transportation now, than was the case in 1905? 
    Or the fact that there are many more whites in Alaska now than there were in 1905? 
    I find--
speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="2156.604" stopTime="2190.204">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    I think that it has very little to do with that. 
    Then, as now, people were transported from the lower 48. 
    If transportation were an issue, then you would have expected some change in the hiring patterns and there really hasn't been a change in the hiring patterns, at least as far as the number or percent of non-whites in the industry as a whole. 
    So, it is an unusual situation. 
    It is not a situation that crops up in the kind of cases that the courts are accustomed to dealing with... namely those that involve full-year employment at a fixed location.

speaker="abraham_a_arditi" startTime="2203.324" stopTime="2231.741">
    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    Well, no doubt that they found that they did. 
    A high percentage of non-whites in the industry has persisted from the time before unions were formed, through today, when we now have unions. 
    The fact is that those minorities are in the industry and it is simply not fair, nor does it comport with Title VII, to say that they can, on this long-term basis, be confined to the low-paying, menial jobs.

    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    No, and if I said that they did, then I misspoke. 
    I would like, if I can, to try to explain the mechanics, to some degree, of how the separate hiring channels work. 
    Non-whites are recruited from largely non-white sources, such as Alaskan native villages, and through foremen of Asian descent, and at Local 37, which is a union with a large Filipino membership. 
    It is undisputed that those who hire for the low-paying, menial jobs, that these primarily non-white sources have no authority to discuss, in any way, shape or form, the possibility of employment in another upper-level job with potential candidates. 
    We have talked a little bit about the fact that there are Alaskan natives recruited from coastal villages who, at least would appear to have significant skills, for the tender and the fishing jobs, that they are excluded. 
    At the same time, we have whites, often who are related to people in management, who are as young as 14 years old, 15 years old, 16 years old and so on, who are employed in the upper-level jobs, the better-paying jobs. 
    Mr. Fryer discussed at length the effect of Local 37 on hiring... the effect of Local 37 on the labor market and on hiring here. 
    We would ask simply that the Court read the provisions of the Local 37 agreement, because the Local 37 agreement vests management with full authority to hire. 
    There are three preferences and the preferences are the only provisions in the labor contract that address hiring. 
    The third preference, which is the last preference, goes to those individuals who are acceptable to management. 
    The other two preferences simply perpetuate the past management choices, by saying that individuals who worked at the same cannery are entitled to first preference on a rehired basis; individuals who worked for the same company at another cannery are entitled to second preference on a rehire basis.

    And it is not, you know, I have no racial bias at all, I just want a family kind of a place, and that would be a violation of law, then?

    Mr. Abraham A. Arditi 
    If the practice has a disparate impact and it cannot be justified by business necessity, then it is a violation of the law, yes. 
    Going further to the issue of Local 37 involvement in the hiring process, again, I would ask the Court to note the fact that the collective bargaining agreement does not provide for a hiring hall. 
    This is not the situation that we often see in the construction industry. 
    It is a situation in which the collective bargaining agreement reserves to management full hiring discretion and authority and management, even if it gets a referral, has every right on earth to simply reject that referral. 
    I would like to address Mr. Fryer's comment that the district court found that there was no deterrence. 
    In fact, the district court made contradictory findings on that. 
    When the district court discussed individual instances of discrimination, made express findings that particular individuals did not seek upper-level jobs because of the segregation in jobs, messing and housing. 
    Also on the question of whether there were, in fact, 24 percent non-whites in the at issue jobs, I don't believe that a reading of even the employer statistics bears that out. 
    What the employer did was include some jobs that are not at-issue, such as, laborer jobs, and I would refer the Court to our Appendices A and B, in which we set out both our own statistics on a department-by-department basis and the employer's statistics on a department-by-department basis. 
    And they show a high degree of racial segregation. 
    Because of the wide geographical area from which people are hired, and because of what appears to be a prevalence of favoritism, particularly in the nepotism area, it is often unrealistic to expect a non-white from one remote area, such as Wapata, Washington, or Bristol Bay, Alaska, to make contact with the tender captain, whose recommendation is the most influential, or the machinist foreman, who, as a practical matter, may make the hiring decisions. 
    Given the far-flung labor market area, from which the employer hires, the effect of the separate hiring channels is really aggravated to an extreme. 
    By the time that the cannery workers arrive at the cannery, the upper-level jobs are already filled. 
    The employer articulated in its brief, and at trial, a policy of discouraging transfers from the heavily non-white cannery worker jobs to the upper-level jobs during the season. 
    So cannery workers are locked in. 
    And the employer also, at a time when the cannery workers have the easiest access to the employer... namely while they are at the cannery... might listen to a request for a better job, but will not consider that an application. 
    Seeing that I am close to the end of my time here, there are a number of practices... there are seven in all... that we challenged. 
    They have produced a work force that is racially stratified, and a work force which has jobs which even the employer expressly labels by race. 
    The employer, in its company records, and in conversation among management officials, refer to Filipino jobs, or Filipino cannery worker jobs, to the native-crew, to the Filipino bunkhouse, to the white mess house and all of those are amply documented in the record. 
    The phrase that the Court of Appeals used in discussing this practice was that it was pervasive. 
    This is a case of the sort that we would have expected to see more reasonably in the late '60s or the early '70s, at the dawn of Title VII. 
    It is, in fact, a case that was filed in the early '70s, in 1974. 
    The record, we believe, makes a very strong showing of the disparate impact of each of these separate practices. 
    Despite this, the employers never really offered evidence that would constitute, in any way, a business necessity, although there is one finding on business necessity that the district court made and that the court of appeals affirmed. 
    Generally, the employer's evidence was not geared toward making the type of showing that this Court has recognized as justifying a disparate impact.

    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    To respond to Justice White's question, we don't go quite as far as the government on point two, Your Honor. 
    And I think that is a somewhat extended discussion and perhaps you can refer to the brief.

speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="3318.977" stopTime="3341.873">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    All right, our position is that it depends on the strengths of the plaintiff's evidence, in a nutshell. 
    And that is the standard we have been applying for civil litigation for probably 200 years... that you weigh the strength of the employer's intermediate burden, depending upon the strength of what the plaintiff has come forward with.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3341.873" stopTime="3347.478">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And anyway, you think that the Court of Appeals was wrong?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="3347.478" stopTime="3355.432">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    We certainly do. 
    Well, first of all, they ignored our evidence and they ignored our attacks on the Plaintiff's evidence.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3355.432" stopTime="3358.654">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But they said that you had to prove what, a business necessity?
speaker="douglas_m_fryer" startTime="3358.654" stopTime="3530.895">
    Mr. Douglas M. Fryer 
    They said that we had to prove business necessity based solely on the Plaintiff's comparative statistics. 
    A couple of things I would like to run over, the respondent's, Mr. Arditi, argued for his labor market theory based upon the history in the industry. 
    That was specifically rejected... rejected by the trial court in findings of fact. 
    Cannery workers are never locked into any of these jobs; they are free to apply at the end of the season and they have seven months to do so. 
    And the district court found that they were treated equally and everyone was free to apply. 
    Contrary to Mr. Arditi's statement, the trial court expressly found that he could find no deterrence on this record, although some of those that testified, testified that they felt they were deterred. 
    In summary, I would urge you to consider that this employer, who has hired more than the available percentage of minorities in the at-issue jobs, should not be penalized simply because he has employed even more in another job classification. 
    Further, when you get to the standard of proof here, and what we must examine the employer's practices by, I would urge the Court to look at the practices the employer actually did use, not the practices the Respondents, or the court of appeals, contend he should have used. 
    That is simply speculation. 
    Look at this employer as to how he did, in fact, employ minorities in this industry. 
    Finally, on the multiple practice challenge, which I really didn't address. 
    In a nutshell, our position on that is, if the employees, if the plaintiffs challenge an employer's practices, under the impact analysis by challenging the bottom line of the total effect, of all of the employer's practices; or if they challenge several practices, their burden is still to prove causation. 
    It is implicit here that the plaintiffs could not prove causation; that is why they have got difficulty. 
    That is why they go to the employer and say, okay, Mr. Employer, you explain it. 
    But that is not how we try civil cases. 
    The plaintiff has simply got to prove his case; it is his theory, it is case. 
    Under the discovery standards, the information may be possessed by the employer, but it is equally available to both sides. 
    In conclusion, I would urge that this Court vacate the decision of the court of appeals and remand for entry of judgment in accordance with the trial court's decision. 
    Thank you.
