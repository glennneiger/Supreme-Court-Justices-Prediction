    Mr. Phil Caldwell Neal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The narrow issue presented by this case is whether a court of appeals may permit amendment of the complaint to drop a nondiverse defendant and thereby perfect diversity jurisdiction so that the court may go on to decide the merits of the appeal. 
    The court below held that it had no such power. 
    The courts of appeals for the Second, Third, Fifth, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits have held to the contrary and, in fact, no court since 1942, which was the Seventh Circuit again, has held that it did not have such power. 
    It is a narrow issue, but perhaps the broader significance of it is that it raises a question whether the powers of the courts of appeals, so far as possible, should be conducted in a way... should be construed in a way that permits the just, speedy and inexpensive termination of controversies as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure admonish. 
    The case arises from a suit brought by the Plaintiff, Petitioner here, the Newman-Green Company, to enforce certain individual guarantee agreements of individuals in Venezuela which guaranteed royalty payments due from a Venezuelan corporation under a license agreement with the Plaintiff corporation. 
    The Plaintiff... the complaint alleged that the five individual Defendants, that four of them were residents and citizens of Venezuela, and that the fifth-named Defendant, one Bettison, was a citizen of the United States, resident in Caracas, Venezuela, and the complaint alleged jurisdiction based on Section 1332 of Title 28. 
    The... no objection to the jurisdiction of the court, of the district court, was made by the Defendants at any time, although they did, oddly enough, move to quash service of process. 
    That was overruled. 
    The case was litigated in the district court for about four-and-a-half years, and you can get some idea of the extensiveness of the... of the litigation and how controverted it was by scanning the docket entries which are reproduced in the... in the joint appendix. 
    At length after four-and-a-half years, during which time the district court had rendered several opinions, the district court rendered summary judgment which disposed of all of the claims against the five individual Defendants. 
    The Venezuelan Corporation itself had intervened in the meantime and had certain counterclaims pending. 
    The district court gave judgment in part for the Plaintiff, and that judgment was eventually satisfied. 
    No appeal was taken from it, but in important aspects gave judgment, summary judgment for the Defendants and entered a Rule 54(b) certification, upon which appeal was taken to the Seventh Circuit. 
    When counsel for the Appellant rose to make his argument, a judge of the Seventh Circuit said, 
    "Do we have jurisdiction of the case? " 
    And it was then and only at that time that anyone realized that in fact, under Section 1332, there was no diversity jurisdiction.

    Mr. Phil Caldwell Neal 
    Judge Easterbrook wrote the dissent, yes. 
    Judge Easterbrook raised the issue and then suggested to counsel that the problem could be solved if the Plaintiffs cared to file a motion to dismiss Bettison, the nondiverse Defendant. 
    The argument continued. 
    The case was taken under submission. 
    The Plaintiff did indeed file such a motion. 
    The Defendants, the Appellees, filed a motion to dismiss the case rather than to dismiss the Defendant, and when the opinion came out, Judge Easterbrook dealt first with the jurisdictional point and then said we grant the motion to dismiss the nondiverse Defendant and proceeded to decide the merits. 
    A motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc was filed. 
    Seventh Circuit granted rehearing en banc, and the result of the en banc hearing was that the majority of the court, in an opinion by Judge Posner, held that Judge Easterbrook's opinion was erroneous, vacated the... vacated the decision of the panel, and held that the court of appeals had no power to amend, to permit the dismissal of a nondiverse Defendant, that that could be done only in the district court and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings to consider whether such a motion should be granted. 
    And indeed, it perhaps bears noting, that the opinion of Judge Posner suggested that the district court might choose to exercise its discretion by saying six years is long enough, and out you go, rather than merely addressing whether they... whether the other side had been somehow prejudiced by the inclusion of Bettison as a Defendant during that period.

    And... and indeed, according to a fairly substantial body of authority, it could have been a remand that directed the district court to permit a dismissal of the nondiverse Defendant on the ground that any contrary action would be an abuse of the district court's discretion. 
    The result of the court of appeals' decision, of course, is that the case would, at a minimum, have to go back to the district, where at best, perhaps, the District Judge would do what Judge Easterbrook had said ought to be done, permit the dismissal of the nondiverse Defendant, and then reconsider and perhaps enter again the same judgment on the same grounds that the district court had done before, and then a new appeal would be started and a year later--

    The other issue, which we think is the only real issue, and I will come back to that one, was whether there is any authority for the court of appeals to permit amendment of the... of the complaint, and there is a specific statute, Section 1653 of Title 28, which says defective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended in either the trial or the appellate court. 
    And... and the majority of the court below held that that didn't reach this case. 
    Judge Easterbrook disagreed on that. 
    What we... and Judge Posner's opinion said there isn't any other source of authority. 
    Courts of appeals don't permit amendments. 
    I suppose what... what we have contributed, if anything, to the solution of this problem is that if you go back to Section 32 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, it expressly confers authority on the courts of appeals, as well as the district courts, to permit... to permit amendment, and... and that... that statute has been relied on more than once by this court to permit--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Amendments of the sort that you would have had to make, Mr. Neal? 
    Judge Posner took the position when, I guess, the defective allegations of jurisdiction were... where the allegations didn't conform to fact and... does the Section 32 authorizer broader amendments than that?

    Mr. Phil Caldwell Neal 
    --It's... it's very general and... it's very general in... in its language, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It's... it's... it's not directed expressly to amendments to preserve or correct jurisdictional defect. 
    It's... it's... it's a general provision permitting the appellate courts to... to permit amendments, and Justice Story way back in... in 1812 wrote an opinion that circuit reported in... in 1 Gallison's Report called Anonymous decision, in which he said there's nothing at common law to prevent courts of appeal as well as trial courts from permitting amendments of the... of the pleadings.

 Mr. Neal, 777... and that was sort of your argument that... that the old Section 32 survives until it's finally picked up somehow in Rule 15, but by the time it gets picked up in Rule 15 with the 48 revision, it... it no longer is the broad jurisdictional provision that you... that you referred to.

    --Well, I think there were changes. 
    I think there were changes in language, Your Honor, and I will not be... I will not be categorical about it. 
    But, as I say, Section 954 was relied on as late as... as 1925 as permitting this kind of amendment there having to do with federal question jurisdiction rather than diversity jurisdiction, and 954, I think, became 777 in the codification of 1926 immediately thereafter. 
    And I'm... and I'm not aware of anything that suggests that there was a purpose at that point to... to... to narrow the... the power. 
    In any event, I do not... it seems to me that the significance of this background is simply that there was recognized from the very beginning a power... power to permit amending the complaint, even on appeal, in order to avoid unnecessary further proceedings at the district court level. 
    This court relied on... on that in... in a number of decisions along the way; Kennedy against the Bank of Georgia in 1850. 
    And even without reliance on that statute, I believe that Justice Marshall... Chief Justice Marshall's decision in Carneal v. Banks back in 1825 is an express... an explicit authorization. 
    It doesn't talk about... about trial or appellate courts. 
    It's pretty clear if that opinion is read carefully, which I don't think anybody else involved in this case has really done, that that opinion is exactly what Judge Easterbrook did in the... in the court below. 
    I think I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Frank K. Heap
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1010.715" stopTime="1013.807">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Neal. 
    Mr. Heap.
speaker="frank_k_heap" startTime="1013.807" stopTime="1110.142">
    Mr. Frank K. Heap 
    Mr. Chief Judge, and may it please the Court: 
    There is a serious of inescapable facts in this case, and those facts very simply are that at the time this complaint was filed, there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction. 
    At the time the case was tried in the district court, there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction. 
    At the time the panel heard the case, there was no subject matter jurisdiction. 
    At the time the full en banc court heard the case, there was no federal jurisdiction, and there is no federal jurisdiction as I stand here today. 
    Mr. Bettison is an offending party. 
    The question is what does one do about it. 
    There was great discussion by both the dissenting opinion and the en banc opinion on the applications of Rules 15 and Rules 21. 
    There was no discussion of Rule 1. 
    Rule 1 very clearly says, 
    "These rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts. " 
    --does not govern the procedures in the circuit court. 
    Whether the circuit court wishes to adopt those rules, it may, but it hasn't in the Seventh. 
    More importantly, all of the opinions have ignored Rule 12(h)(3), and that rule very clearly say whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Heap, supposing that it had come to the court of appeals' attention that this fifth Defendant was, in fact, diverse, so that you're not talking about an... an amendment to change facts or... or a dismissal of a defendant who couldn't be sustained with complete diversity, but just an... an erroneous factual allegation. 
    Could the court of appeals have done nothing about that?
speaker="frank_k_heap" startTime="1136.248" stopTime="1170.462">
    Mr. Frank K. Heap 
    I believe that Rules 15... 1653 very clearly covers that situation, and that may be done in either the trial court or the appellate court if it is a defective matter of pleading; i.e., in your particular case, Chief Judge... Justice, the case where you had mispleaded, where you had diversity. 
    The problem with 1653, however, is that you cannot drop people in order to create that jurisdiction. 
    There's a long list and long series of cases on that very subject.

    I think the time and the reason this case has importance, I believe, today is that this court ought to give direction to the circuit courts as to what you do when you clearly have no federal subject matter jurisdiction.

    Mr. Frank K. Heap 
    There are cases that have applied, and particularly on the West Coast, have applied Rule 15 to allow this relation back. 
    There are an equal number of cases in the circuit that the test of federal jurisdiction is determined at the time the case is filed and subsequent events don't change that fact. 
    It's a very difficult situation. 
    It has never reached this Court before. 
    The Court has come very close in a couple of cases to address this question, but it's... my research has revealed this is the first time the issue has been directly before this Court.

   Rebuttal of Phil Caldwell Neal

    Mr. Phil Caldwell Neal 
    I think I would only... only like to comment on what seems to me to be a misconception, not only in Mr. Heap's argument, but also in Judge Posner's opinion. 
    And that is that what is involved in this case involves somehow changing the facts as they existed when the complaint was filed. 
    We have... we do not... we do not question the general position that jurisdiction in a federal court is determined by the facts as of the date the case was filed. 
    No facts are being changed here. 
    It's not as though you were trying to show that Mr. Bettison had become a citizen of a state, even though he was not at the time the action was filed. 
    All that's being changed here is a... is a pleading. 
    It is dropping an allegation which defeats federal jurisdiction, and Section 1653, on its face, is designed to permit the changing of pleadings, not the changing of facts. 
    This is not the changing of facts. 
    I think the other thing that I would... and, of course, to... to call that into question is to call into question the massive body of precedent that goes all the way back to 1825 and has been continuous. 
    We've set forth on... on I think two or three pages of our reply brief the cases, and they're only part of the cases. 
    And even though Judge Posner in his opinion toward the end of it, seemed to express some discomfort with that thought, the cases are there, and I submit that you really can't reconcile those cases with what's really the fundamental premise of Judge Posner's opinion.

    And it's really what makes me think that the kind of admonitory purpose of Judge Posner's opinion, which seems to me to be a kind of dunce cap theory of jurisprudence. 
    Go back to the district court, and that's wearing the dunce cap, and everybody will see and be wiser from there on. 
    If they were not successful in imparting this wisdom when it was part of their function to do so, I'm a little skeptical that this opinion will have all that... all that effect. 
    And I suppose the only thing I... I should throw in here in view of the string of University of Chicago people you've mentioned who were associated with this is... the only explanation I was able to get why my younger and brighter colleagues who were participants in this error was one of them said yes, he took federal jurisdiction at the University of Chicago, but it was taught that year by a visiting professor from Harvard, and they didn't deal with diversity jurisdiction.
