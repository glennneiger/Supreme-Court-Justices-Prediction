    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    To understand the double jeopardy issue and to understand the federalism issue before the Court today, it is necessary to, uh, to discuss briefly the facts that have led, the 15 years of facts that have lead up to this, to the present appeal. 
    In November of 1972, the respondent, in an attempted robbery and in in the City of St. Louis, killed a fellow named Mentoe Vernell. 
    The next spring, in May of '73, the respondent was found guilty in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis. 
    The Judge sentenced the respondent to 15 years imprisonment for the attempted robbery conviction and to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder conviction, those sentences to run consecutively and in that order. 
    In other words, 15 years, and once the 15 years is complete, then service of the life sentence begins. 
    In 1975, the conviction was affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals. 
    Two years later, in 1977, the respondent initiated a post-conviction action in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis. 
    A post-conviction action in State Court in the State of Missouri is called a 2726 motion, and we'll probably refer to it as that today. 
    In the year 1980 and in 1981, the Missouri Supreme Court issued two opinions in cases called State v. Olds and State v. Morgan. 
    In those cases, the Missouri Supreme Court determined that the Missouri legislature did not intend that there be multiple punishments, did not intend that the, that, that, that defendants be punished twice for felony murder and underlying felony. 
    Shortly after those opinions, on March 27, 1981, the 2726 motion, the PCR motion, was amended to include a double jeopardy claim on the basis of State v. Morgan and State v. Olds. 
    Later that year, three months later in June 16, 1981, then Governor Christopher Bond issued a commutation to the respondent for the attempted robbery conviction and sentence. 
    One year later, June of 1982, the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis granted respondent's motion for 2726 Relief. 
    The attempted robbery conviction and sentence were vacated.

    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    Okay. 
    Olds and Morgan are collateral proceedings. 
    They involve completely different defendants, and it was not until after Morgan and Olds were decided by the Missouri Supreme Court that the 2726 motion was amended to, to include a double jeopardy claim. 
    Before Morgan and Olds, there was no, there was no indication in the Missouri jurisprudence that there was a, there potentially could be a double jeopardy problem here. 
    In fact, in State versus Overstreet, the Missouri Supreme Court indicated that there was no double jeopardy problem.

    I guess you didn't understand my question.

speaker="stephen_d_hawke" startTime="229.524" stopTime="489.787">
    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    Okay. 
    When the 2726 motion was initially filed in 1977, it was denied. 
    The denial went up on appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals and was remanded back to the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis because there was an incomplete record for the, for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consider the 2726 appeal. 
    The Governor's commutation is completely separate. 
    It is completely different. 
    There is no, I do not believe that there's any relationship between the Governor's commutation and the double jeopardy claim. 
    During the late 70s and early 80s, uh, there was a program with the Missouri Department of Corrections where governors commutations were issued where a prisoner serves seven-twelfths of his time in a peaceable manner. 
    And there is discussion of that old governor's commutation program in cases called Love v. Black and Parrish v. Wyrick, which I believe are cited in brief, uh, on, in the main brief. 
    But the, but to answer your question directly, there is, I do not believe that there is any relationship between the commutation and the litigation in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis. 
    The 2726 relief was granted by the St. Louis City Circuit Court. 
    The attempted robbery conviction and sentence were vacated and held for nought. 
    The respondent appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals arguing that the attempted, that the first-degree murder conviction need to be vacated as well. 
    The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of relief and held the procedures used by the rule 27.26 circuit court did not prejudice the respondent. 
    With those facts in mind, it is now necessary to examine what exactly happened in the courts below, the federal court below, after the petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed. 
    And in the appeal to the, uh, to the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. 
    As the Court knows, in a panel opinion there were three different opinions issued by the panel, uh, the effect of which were to, uh, rule that a double jeopardy violation existed but to remand the case to the state court to determine if, if the double jeopardy violation could be cured. 
    The 8th Circuit sitting en banc reheard the case and ruled on a five to four decision that the respondent's double jeopardy rights were violated. 
    With this background and procedure in mind, It's now necessary to examine exactly the, what the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled and to examine whether or not the respondent's double jeopardy rights have been violated. 
    The Court of Appeals ruling held for nought the litigation that occurred in the, in, in the state court. 
    Held for nought the litigation that vacated the multiple punishment. 
    For the respondent to be entitled to federal habeas corpus relief, he must demonstrate that he is 
    "in custody in violation of the Constitutional laws or treaties of the United States. " 
    That is the language of the habeas corpus statute. 
    Now, the respondent attempts to invoke the double jeopardy clause. 
    The double jeopardy clause of the, of the Constitution, as this Court noted in North Carolina v. Pearce, protects against reconviction after an acquittal, mind that's not the situation here. 
    It protects against, uh, uh, a reconviction after, after a conviction. 
    It prohibits reprosecution after a conviction. 
    That's not the situation here. 
    North Carolina v. Pearce also describes that the double jeopardy clause precludes multiple punishment. 
    This Court in its, has described what it means by multiple punishment in a series of cases from back in the early 80s in DiFrancesco, in Whalen and in Missouri v. Hunter. 
    This Court has described the multiple punishment aspect of the double jeopardy clause as prohibiting punishment that is in excess of what the legislature intended. 
    In this situation, the legislature--

    The state court, the 2726 court examined the amended motion for 2726 relief and vacated the attempted robbery conviction and sentence, with that time being credited towards completion of, of, of the murder sentence. 
    When you look at the habeas statute, the habeas statute says, whether or not the petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitutional laws or treaties of the United States.

    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    --It's a situation where Missouri remedies exist where defendants can vacate, uh, convictions that have already been served. 
    In Missouri procedure we have a procedure called writ of error coram nobis that is exclusively available for petitioners who have already completed service of their sentence. 
    So it's not unheard of at all. 
    Now, and in fact, I believe this Court heard last in, last month a case called Mullain where the Court is considering expanding the scope of federal, uh, of 2254A to include petitioners who have already completed service of their sentences. 
    So, you know, the, the fact that the, that the, uh, vacation occurred after the commutation I don't believe is particularly significant and should not be particularly significant. 
    We shouldn't say that on Janu..., on June 15 of '81 the defendant was, could, could get 2726 relief and that on June 17, the day after the commutation, that he couldn't. 
    That doesn't make real good sense. 
    That's drawing a line based really on a technicality, uh, because the defendant was entitled to relief from the state court and that's what he got. 
    Now, the, the, the technical nature of this situation, the technical reliance upon the, the technical aspect of relying upon Bradley and upon Lange, best is really described well by the dissent from the en banc opinion of the 8th Circuit. 
    In, when you follow those cases blindly, you're destroying the intent of the Missouri legislature for this crime of attempted robbery with a murder along with it. 
    The, the Missouri legislature intends that there be life imprisonment. 
    You are also destroying the intent of the sentencing judge. 
    The sentencing judge was showing society's outrage at the heinous nature of the respondent's crimes when he sentenced the respondent to 15 years and life imprisonment, the maximum terms, and then ordered them to run consecutively. 
    Now, if the, if the sentencing judge had not, had done the opposite, if he had set the life term first, we would not be before this Court. 
    There would not be any problem. 
    If the sentencing judge had been nice to the defendant, if he had ordered that the terms run concurrently, again, we would not be before this Court. 
    The, as the opinion below notes, that's due to just the whim of the 15 year term running first is because, is because it was the first count in the charging document. 
    Just happen chance. 
    Happen, happen, happenstance that it occurred that way. 
    So, really when you are looking at this case, the, the situation is really not like Lange and Bradley as long as you interpret Lange and Bradley as only being consistent with this Court's jurisprudence in multiple punishment areas. 
    This defendant today has one conviction. 
    This defendant has one sentence. 
    This defendant has only served time since 1973 for the completion of that felony murder sentence. 
    There is no multiple punishment. 
    There is no multi-- 
    If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Springfield Baldwin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    I think that if the Court sees fit to reverse the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, the law of double Jeopardy is going to be about as confused as I think the argument I just heard was. 
    The facts in this thing are simple. 
    In fact, I'm amazed that there has been all this commotion over this case. 
    I think since the Fifth Amendment was adopted, when a man was convicted of what is legally one crime, served one legal, lawful sentence for it, he was entitled to go free.

    --I beg your pardon, sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1368.363" stopTime="1390.698">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I said, there's a certain ludicrousness about what happened here, because the man was convicted of attempted robbery. 
    He was convicted of murder. 
    He ends up serving a sentence for attempted robbery, seven or eight years, and the 8th Circuit says he's free under the double jeopardy clause. 
    Now, that wouldn't make any sense to an awful lot of people if you just explained it to them.
speaker="springfield_baldwin" startTime="1390.698" stopTime="1533.546">
    Mr. Springfield Baldwin 
    Well, I would say this. 
    I think one thing that has been completely overlooked in this case so far is the effect of a governor's commutation of a sentence. 
    When the Governor commuted the man's sentence, then the legal position in Missouri and in, I think, the universal law, accord..., at least according to American jurisprudence, is that the man's legal position is the same as if he had been originally sentenced to that length of time. 
    Now this Court, in Whalen v. the United States, held that, uh, where there is a felony murder the underlying felony is a lesser-included defense, and unless the legislative body had decided there should be multiple punishment, there should not be one. 
    It was one crime. 
    And this man committed one crime. 
    They call it first-degree murder. 
    But it is the codification of the old felony murder. 
    He received the robbery sentence. 
    He apparently was a very good boy in prison and so forth. 
    We are not informed as to why the Governor commuted his sentence, but I know from the motions I had to file to get that writ of habeas corpus that he had completed his high school equivalency, had completed, uh, two years of college with grades of A and B. 
    Uh, and he is now living with his sister, the school teacher, and is now employed. 
    Uh, my opponent said there would be no problem if he had only been sentenced to life imprisonment first and not the 15 year sec... not the 15 years first. 
    That, I submit, is not true. 
    Because no matter which he had been sentenced to first, when the Governor commutes one of them, he has served one complete, legitimate sentence. 
    Uh, the concept of Lange, Lange definitely held.

    Mr. Springfield Baldwin 
    I do not know. 
    Uh, Lange was a case where a man had been stealing mail bags and, uh, the district court sentenced him contrary to the statute to two sentences. 
    The statute provided he could be fined or imprisoned. 
    And the judge assessed both against him. 
    The lawyer ran in and paid the fine. 
    And the Supreme Court said, the judgment is satisfied. 
    It was a legitimate alternative penalty of the law and he satisfied, and it's over. 
    He's to be discharged. 
    A double jeopardy clause, of course, applies to the states as held in Benton v. Maryland by this Court. 
    And now, that, that, uh, the respondent Larry Thomas has served one legitimate sentence for his felony murder, he is entitled to be discharged. 
    And I think that's pretty open and shut. 
    Now, if you want to abandon that, you are really going to foul up the law of double jeopardy. 
    And I don't think anybody is going to know what it means in the future. 
    Uh, my opponent said that the time that he had served on his 15 year sentence was credited. 
    Now the Missouri Court of Appeals did say that it had been credited. 
    But when I read the lower courts, the Missouri Circuit Court's judgment on a 2726, I did not see where it mentioned that it was crediting that time.

    --Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    We have the Lange decision of 115 years ago, and then, uh, the next thing we have is, uh, I think, uh, United States versus Benz, which was to the same effect. 
    And that was in 1930. 
    Then we have In re Bradley, which was in 1943. 
    Bradley, of course, was convicted of a contempt of court for threatening a witness in the corridor of the courthouse, fined and sentenced to jail. 
    His lawyer paid the fine, and uh, the court said he had satisfied the judgment. 
    Here, this defendant was charged with robbery, first-degree, and he was charged, I mean, with attempted robbery, and he was charged with felony murder. 
    He was convicted. 
    Judgment was entered on two counts, and he could have been sentenced to either one. 
    And he was sentenced to both. 
    I see no difference in principle between the fact that there were alternative penalties. 
    When he served one, he had satisfied the judgment. 
    And, uh, this kind of law has been the law of this nation, I think, since the beginning. 
    Furthermore, I would really like to emphasize, too, the effect of the Governor's commutation. 
    I'd like to make the analogy. 
    Suppose that there was a federal prisoner. 
    And under the law that passed, Congress passed, some district court judge had sentenced him to forty years, and two days later the President of the United States, under his power to pardon or reprieve, did one or the other so that the man went free, would the court then say, oh, the trial judge intended he serve 40 years. 
    Congress intended that he serve 40 years. 
    We'll just set that first 40 year sentence aside and we'll then reinstate it. 
    That way we get around the President's pardon or reprieve. 
    And so it's only fair that he serve 40 years. 
    I don't think you would do that.

    No, I don't, because it has been the precedent as set in Ex Parte Lange that the sentences in that case, the sentences in, in, uh, in re Bradley, the sentences in United States v. Benz, were voidable, not void. 
    So, since they were voidable, I do not see any reason that the Governor or Missouri could not commute one of them and when he does so, he has served a complete sentence for his crime.

    Mr. Springfield Baldwin 
    --Then you're getting in, I believe, to a different class of cases. 
    There is a class of cases where the defendant has not finished the sentence. 
    He's received two sentences. 
    He should have only received one. 
    And neither has been completed. 
    This Court and other federal courts, I don't know, I think this Court, but I know other federal courts have held the trial judge may then make a choice between the two. 
    Uh, vacate one and give him the other. 
    That's the way I understand it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2088.994" stopTime="2097.101">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    How much of that is double jeopardy, law, uh, Mr. Baldwin, and how much is just ordinary state criminal law or sentencing law?
speaker="springfield_baldwin" startTime="2097.101" stopTime="2488.568">
    Mr. Springfield Baldwin 
    I believe in those cases that Justice Scalla, I believe, inferentially referred to, that that is double jeopardy law, because I believe the, the defendants in those cases have maintained that the double jeopardy clause was being violated by the court not doing what they wanted. 
    Whereas, the courts have said, in that situation it's what the trial judge wants. 
    So I think double jeopardy has been an issue in those. 
    And, uh, I believe during argument in the court, in the 8th Circuit, I pointed out that the, uh, the Attorney, Assistant Attorney General had, uh, not cited a single case in point on these facts. 
    And, uh, I don't think he has yet. 
    It's a princi... it's a legal principal that's endured, I would believe, for centuries. 
    And, I don't know why it should be changed. 
    If it is true, and I believe it is, that the founding fathers put the first ten amendments in the Constitution to restrain the power of courts and I respectfully submit you should be restrained and affirm the judgment of the 8th Circuit. 
    I think there's another reason. 
    If the Governor of Missouri wanted to commute this man's sentence, he gave him a present, so to speak. 
    He may not have realized he was giving him a present, but he gave him one. 
    And now you are asked to reach back in time and make the position of the prisoner more onerous. 
    Now my opponent says, I say that's a ex post facto type judgment, which is forbidden by the due process clause according to your case of Boule v. City of Columbia. 
    My opponent says that point was not raised originally and cannot now be raised because it's a matter of procedural default. 
    I say that since the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was for the prisoner, that I can cite that as a reason to support that judgment. 
    I don't think you have to cross-appeal. 
    I don't think you have to do anything. 
    Uh, I mean, just to be absurd, if, uh, it was proposed that you engage in 104 constitutional violations, uh, and I argued, uh, oh, that's all right because it wasn't raised in the court below, that's pretty silly. 
    Uh, and here it is proposed that you enter an ex post facto judgment which you have said violates due process. 
    And, uh, I might point out, of course, that the various United States Courts of Appeals have followed these cases of Ex parte Lange, In re Bradley, United States versus Benz, and we have their cases that are right in line. 
    And you are just going to upset the whole thing if you reverse the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    Uh, besides, you are going to really be holding the Missouri Governor's power to commute sentences for nought, because that's going to be taken away from him. 
    He no longer has that. 
    He no longer can say, I served that sentence. 
    No doubt taking that away from him makes his situation more onerous. 
    Uh, you pointed out in Weaver versus Graham that when Florida enacted a statute that took away good time, it was an ex post fact statute as far as those prisoners who had earned good time under that, and made their condition more onerous. 
    And you held it was unconstitutional. 
    You, uh, had somewhat the same, uh, situation, well, not really, but you had an ex post facto judgment in that Boule versus the City of Columbia. 
    There two blacks went into a drugstore, sat at a counter where they, or sat in a booth, where they might be served food. 
    In those days in South Carolina, places were not serving blacks. 
    And they didn't actually refer, uh, refuse to serve them. 
    What they actually did was they asked them to leave. 
    The statute said that, uh, if you enter upon a landowner's property without his consent where you have received notice that you shall not enter, then that's some kind of a crime. 
    And the South Carolina court interpreted this statute to add this additional business which wasn't in it, that if you are asked to leave, you violated that statute. 
    And they, you're, this Court said that's not so. 
    That's an ex post facto judgment. 
    And that's that you're doing when you take this commuted sentence away and say it's of no effect. 
    The simple thing is that once in a while, under the Constitution, things happen that courts don't like. 
    And I think that there is where you have to decide you'll be restrained. 
    So, I would ask that you affirm the judgment.

speaker="stephen_d_hawke" startTime="2494.091" stopTime="2567.861">
    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court: 
    One of the last comments that were made by the respondent was, sometimes the federal Constitution requires courts to do things that the courts don't like. 
    If that's the situation, then perhaps there is a fundamental flaw in what the court is thinking. 
    The example here is with multiple punishments. 
    The multiple punishment concept of the double jeopardy clause only prohibits multiple punishment that it, or not, or only prohibits punishment that is not authorized by the legislature. 
    The, the, the application of Bradley to this situation is what creates the problem. 
    It's what created the result of the, of the five judges from the Eighth Circuit. 
    When you look at Bradley, and when you look at it and, and think that the rule announced in Bradley, that completion of service of alternative sentences precludes the power of the court to punish further, that language, the holding in Bradley, which is dicta from Lange, had no support before Bradley, and has not been followed by this Court since Bradley.

    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    The, the Court discussed this in DiFrancesco, and in the situation here, you either have, you have a defendant's subjective expectation at the time of sentencing that he's going to serve 15 years followed by a life sentence. 
    That was his subjective expectation when the sentencing judge announced his intent in sentencing, or announced his sentence. 
    Do you want to look at some objective in expectation of the defendant? 
    The defendant's objective expectation at the time of sentencing was that he would either serve 15 years for the attempted robbery conviction or that he would serve a life term for the murder connected with the attempted robbery. 
    Now, if you look at that objective expectation that the defendant may have, that's what's been fulfilled here. 
    The defendant is under one conviction for one sentence, life imprisonment. 
    So, any expecta... ex, uh, expectancy interest by the defendant is not, is not really at issue in this particular case, be it either at a subjective level or at--

    Mr. Stephen D. Hawke 
    And in response to that, I do not believe that the Court should, should examine the, uh, the case under the double jeopardy clause in a technical manner. 
    The Court should look at the purposes behind the double jeopardy clause, uh, in this case be it examining the, uh, making sure the punishment is not exceeding the, uh, the legislature's intent, and perhaps some expectancy interest. 
    I don't think you have to get into any type of expectancy interest in this case, because other under either a subjective or objective, uh, interest in the defendant, would not, is not implicated here. 
    The process of sentencing is not a, is, it it is a serious subject. 
    It's a, it's an important subject, one of the more important things, perhaps most important thing, that a trial judge, be it at the state court level or at the federal court level, has to do. 
    And as this Court noted in Bozza, that sentencing should not be transferred into, into a game. 
    It should not be a situation where, uh, where a technical rule violates the legislative intent or the senator's intent. 
    The situation you have in this case, if you affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is that you have transformed the sentencing process into a game. 
    In particular, a game where the judge didn't have the rules, the sentencing judge didn't have the rules of the game until eight years later. 
    It's like playing Monopoly without having the rules that Milton Bradley gives you. 
    It's just not, it's just not the way that it should be. 
    For the reasons stated, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit be reversed.
