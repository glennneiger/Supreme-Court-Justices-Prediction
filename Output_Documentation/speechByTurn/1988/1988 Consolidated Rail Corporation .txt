    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-1, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Association. 
    Mr. Morikawa.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="11.805" stopTime="160.401">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    At issue today is the right of Conrail's Medical Department to continue its longstanding practice of establishing and maintaining the standards by which its employees will be deemed medically fit for duty. 
    The standards have always included Conrail's right to require that its employees submit to physical examinations, the purpose of which is to determine these employees' fitness for duty. 
    These examinations have routinely been required throughout Conrail's history as part of its regular business. 
    The focal point of this litigation then is the addition by Conrail of a drug test to these routine physical fitness examinations. 
    It is our contention this morning that the addition of that drug test was at least arguably related to the general fitness for duty standards which Conrail had the right to maintain, as it had over the years. 
    And, as a result, the challenge by the unions to the addition of this drug test to the physical examinations represented a claim which should have been resolved in the statutory adjustment process of arbitration provided under the Railway Labor Act. 
    We will demonstrate that the lower court exceeded the limited judicial role which the courts play in the process of determining the proper forum in which these disputes are to be resolved because in this case, we contend, that the lower court proceeded to decide the merits of the underlying dispute and in that process exceeded that role which the courts have clearly carved out in determining whether minor disputes exist in this... under the Act. 
    Now, I'd like to take a moment to examine Conrail's longstanding medical fitness for duty practices that have existed since 1976, the year when Conrail was first created, because we believe that these facts amply demonstrate the particular reasons why Conrail contended in the first place that the addition of the drug test was clearly related to its fitness for duty determinations. 
    First of all, since 1976, at the time Conrail first came into existence, the railroad had a Medical Department which determined standards for employee fitness. 
    Throughout the history of Conrail the Medical Department has had the discretionary right to always determine fitness-for-duty standards, part of that being the inclusion of these kinds of physical examinations. 
    Not--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is this... is this pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Mr. Morikawa?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="164.020" stopTime="183.684">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --No, your Honor, it was not. 
    It was pursuant to the general policies that were implemented at the time that Conrail was created. 
    But it was never bargained over with the unions. 
    In fact, the whole issue of medical fitness-for-duty standards has been a subject which traditionally in the railroad industry has not been a subject over which the railroads and the unions have bargained.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="183.684" stopTime="199.409">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Morikawa, I gather that before 1987 the medical screening did not include testing for drug use except on the basis of particularized suspicion. 
    Is that right?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="199.409" stopTime="211.853">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The lower court in this case characterized the kind of drug testing that had been done as being done on particularized suspicion. 
    And, frankly, your Honor, we're not quite clear what that term really means in the context of a physical examination.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="211.853" stopTime="215.221">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But we accept that as the case, do we not?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="215.221" stopTime="238.753">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    As a matter of fact, we believe that if you look into the practices of the parties that did exist, it included not just testing at the discretion of a physician, as in that situation, but it also included drug testing that had been done by Conrail on a broader base in 1984 when for a period of six months it implemented drug testing across the board and part of these routine physical examinations.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="238.753" stopTime="259.850">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you see any limits on the tests that Conrail could require for medical testing? 
    Could it test... initiate testing for AIDS or pregnancy, for example, in the urine specimens without characterizing it as a major dispute?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="259.850" stopTime="264.902">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    We contend that Conrail had the right to determine fitness for duty, as it had been its practice.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="264.902" stopTime="265.452">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Uh-huh.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="265.452" stopTime="309.547">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The question of whether or not AIDS relates to fitness for duty is certainly problematic. 
    Or pregnancy, as to whether that relates to fitness for duty. 
    The question, however, is that the Medical Department has seen fit to develop various standards over the years which in its judgment it felt appropriate to the question of employee fitness. 
    As a consequence of that, the Medical Department, we contend, has had the right and must continue to have the right, based on these practices, to be able to respond to emerging threats to employee fitness for duty. 
    And in this particular situation, whether or not pregnancy or AIDS would represent a fitness for duty threat we don't know at this point, but we believe that the Medical Department should have that right to make determinations. 
    Now, I'd like to continue on--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="309.547" stopTime="314.068">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, their system didn't work very well with respect to the Maryland disaster, did it?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="314.068" stopTime="371.421">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --It certainly did not, your Honor. 
    One of the problems that occurred at the Chase, Maryland accident on January 4, 1987 was the discovery consequently by the National Transportation Safety Board that the Conrail engineer and breakman involved in that collision had been using marijuana just prior to the accident. 
    And I think this highlights one of the critical problems that we've had to face with respect to the drug issue. 
    I think it was quite well known at the time that when Ricky Gates, the engineer of that Conrail engine, left the Baltimore Yard he was seen by a trainmaster who testified later that Ricky Gates seemed normal, did not seem to have any apparent problem or difficulty. 
    And yet 15 minutes later the consequential crash occurred in the Northeast Corridor. 
    This highlighted in our minds the major problem that we had with respect to the question of drugs. 
    The difficulty of detecting drugs and yet its profound impact on employee fitness and on performance of our employees.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="371.421" stopTime="394.703">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Now, you have a new test out, I'll put it that way. 
    To what extent does the desired test differ in any way as far as the individual is concerned from what it was before the test for drug was instituted? 
    The blood is drawn... is it any different with respect to the individual?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="394.703" stopTime="398.924">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The test that's involved in this case, your Honor, is a urine sample, not a blood test.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="398.924" stopTime="399.257">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="399.257" stopTime="407.746">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    But the urine sample was required to be taken as part of the routine physical examinations back to 1976. 
    So, this test has always been part of the physical.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="407.746" stopTime="412.064">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But the patient does nothing any different now than he did before the test was refined?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="412.064" stopTime="422.020">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That is precisely correct, your Honor. 
    The only thing we did in this case was to add another test to the existing urine sample to test for the existence of drugs under the circumstances.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="422.020" stopTime="434.430">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And I suppose this is to be anticipated as medicine develops and we find out more about urine and its possibilities.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="434.430" stopTime="486.128">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    To give you one example, the issue of cocaine has always been a profound problem in the industry and in the public at large. 
    Only eight or nine years ago magazines were touting the fact that cocaine was a major new drug which had come on the scene and that people could use it and they could use it to their pleasure without worrying about the problems of addiction related to cocaine. 
    Seven or eight years later now, we now determine through the medical industry that cocaine... it may be the most addictive drug in the market today and may represent the greatest threat to employee fitness. 
    So, you see that the whole concept of medicine and the way it addresses certain kinds of problems constantly evolves in changes. 
    And in our situation we felt that it was necessary to be able to have the Medical Department be in a position to be able to respond to these kinds of changes in employee fitness questions.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="486.128" stopTime="497.253">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Morikawa, is the consequences of being unfit for duty for medical reasons... are they determined by the collective bargaining agreement or are they set by the railroad?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="497.253" stopTime="504.757">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The consequences of being determined unfit for duty are determined by the past practices between the parties in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="504.757" stopTime="508.894">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And what were the consequences before this change?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="508.894" stopTime="518.667">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    An employee who was disqualified based on a medical condition was disqualified from duty and was not paid until that same employee was requalified to go back to duty.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="518.667" stopTime="523.571">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And have those... are those same consequences attached to failure of this test a couple of times?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="523.571" stopTime="550.805">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Yes, your Honor. 
    That same situation occurs here. 
    An employee tests positive for drugs, is immediately disqualified, and is not paid, similar to all other conditions. 
    The slight difference in this situation, however, is that we have developed a response to deal with the question of drugs. 
    One of those responses is we have devised a network for providing drug counseling and assistance to employees, recognizing the drug-dependency problem that can exist--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="550.805" stopTime="554.190">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And what happens if the employee fails two or three times?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="554.190" stopTime="604.190">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --The employee goes into the program. 
    There are two components to the program, as we have it. 
    One is the counseling program. 
    The employees work with drug counselors, and not a single employee has ever been disciplined in that program at all. 
    The other aspect of the program is a 45-day aspect. 
    And that simply says this. 
    If you are not dependent upon drugs, what the Medical Department says is: If you have drugs in your system, we don't want you coming back to duty. 
    So, the 45-day period was addressed by the Medical Department recognizing the fact that drugs potentially could stay in a person's system for up to 45 days. 
    The employee in this situation who tests positive can test as many times as he or she wants to do in the 45-day period. 
    If they test negative, they go back to work. 
    If they test positive, nothing happens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="604.190" stopTime="606.974">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Will they ever get to the point where they are discharged?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="606.974" stopTime="626.888">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The end of the 45-day period could occur conceivably in which an employee refuses to test negative for the existence of drugs. 
    And under those circumstances the employee has in our view taken choice. 
    That is, he said that he is not going to provide a urine sample that is clean of drugs in order to go back to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="626.888" stopTime="630.007">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, see, he's willing to provide the sample, but it doesn't turn out to be clean.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="630.007" stopTime="632.209">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --Another aspect of the program is this--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="632.209" stopTime="635.427">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I'm trying to find... is there a point where he'll be discharged?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="635.427" stopTime="644.017">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --There is a point in this process in which an employee who is unable... who does not provide a clean urine sample can be dismissed. 
    But we contend that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="644.017" stopTime="648.551">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Now, was that true before under your old practice that you say this is just continuation of?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="648.551" stopTime="661.126">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --Employees have for years been required by the Medical Department to comply with its rules and regulations and instructions. 
    And employees have in the past, for example, been disciplined or dismissed for falling to show up for a physical examination.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="661.126" stopTime="672.217">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I understand. 
    But, say, somebody got pneumonia and he came... he thought he was well and he took a test, and no, you're not healthy enough to go back in to work. 
    And then he comes back 45 days later and fails again. 
    Would he be fired?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="672.217" stopTime="724.635">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That employee would-probably be treated by the Medical Department given the fact that that was a physical condition that was affecting that employee. 
    I think the comparison, your Honor, if I can make that, is this. 
    Employees who have an affliction... that is, are drug-dependent... are the real core of employees to be compared to the employees who are suffering from physical problems and maladies. 
    As to those employees, our program provides assistance, counseling, and treatment. 
    As to employees who say they are not drug-dependent, our contention is that these employees are being told by the Medical Department simply to stop using drugs. 
    That's a voluntary act on the part of the employee. 
    He or she has a choice, to get the drugs out of their system or not go to work under the circumstances. 
    So, the volitional and non-volitional side of drugs is the way that this has been reflected in the program.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="724.635" stopTime="741.513">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I'm not so much concerned about whether it's volition or not as whether it's a continuation of the past practice or if there is a significant change. 
    And I think arguably it would be a significant change if the failure of this test could result in discharge while the failure of the prior test would just result in waiting another week or two to go back to work.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="741.513" stopTime="750.785">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Well, certainly, our contention in this case is that the purpose of this program... and, in fact, the practical effect of this program, has not been disciplinary at all. 
    Unfortunately, what the court did in this case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="750.785" stopTime="753.821">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But aren't you trying to get people addicted to drugs off... off the line?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="753.821" stopTime="791.779">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --We certainly are trying to prevent employees from using drugs in the industry because we believe it affects fitness. 
    But the problem we see here is that in determining the existence of the minor dispute in this case by determining the practical impact, the court in this case went beyond its limited role. 
    It determined that because the impact... potentially... of the use of drugs was different than it conceived the prior impact of other physical conditions, that this would change the question of whether or not Conrail's position was even arguable. 
    I think that's the important focal point of this case. 
    What we are contending in this case is--

    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The court in Elgin read into the Act two distinct kinds of matters or disputes that can arise. 
    The first being major disputes which are disputes over new conditions in the future, new agreements. 
    And those are provisions which would be governed by Section 6. 
    The other aspect of these kinds of disputes are minor disputes. 
    The larger number of disputes that occur day to day between carriers and unions.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1036.033" stopTime="1040.735">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What was the basis for this distinction? 
    What statutory language was the basis for this distinction?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1040.735" stopTime="1051.277">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Section 3 of the Act, 153 of the Act, which provides for the Statutory Adjustment Boards to determine disputes that arise daily between carriers and unions.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1051.277" stopTime="1052.743">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And that's the operative language?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1052.743" stopTime="1053.729">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That's correct, your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1053.729" stopTime="1056.012">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Where... where is that found in your joint Appendix?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1056.012" stopTime="1091.768">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    It's found at page 138 and 139. 
    If you proceed through Section 3 of the Act, to page 141, we see the various provisions of the Act pertaining to the authority of the various Adjustment Boards to resolve disputes between employees and certain unions and the carriers. 
    And what Elgin read into that was the understanding that these kinds of disputes, minor disputes, would be resolved through the provisions of the Act in Section 3 by one of these designated statutory Adjustment Boards.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1091.768" stopTime="1101.707">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No particular phrase or clause? 
    Just... just from the whole... I mean, it goes on for a number of pages... and one reads all of that and gets a notion of minor dispute?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1101.707" stopTime="1164.947">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That's essentially correct, your Honor. 
    The court looked into the provisions of the existence of the Adjustment Boards and read into that the fact that these kinds of disputes would be resolved by these Adjustment Boards, and that's precisely why they were created. 
    Now, the issue involved in this case, in terms of the lower court's decision, pertain to the court's conclusion that this was not a minor dispute, but in fact a major dispute. 
    And we believe what drove the court's decision was drug testing standing alone. 
    In the court's opinion, the lower court concluded, that because drug testing was so controversial, was so full of practical dilemmas and problems, it looked back... it caused it to look back into the past practices of the party, and instead of looking at the overall right which Conrail had to determine fitness for duty, it focused only on one narrow portion of the past practice involving when Conrail had tested based on what it described as particularized suspicion. 
    By doing that, we contend--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1164.947" stopTime="1169.099">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say "what it described", you mean the court or Conrail? 
    Which is the antecedent?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1169.099" stopTime="1223.167">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --The court described that as particularized suspicion. 
    As I mentioned earlier, there is no concept of particularized suspicion in the medical community or in our Medical Department. 
    Physicians do not test on particularized suspicion. 
    They examine employees and they determine solely whether or not that employee may have a detectable condition. 
    Now, in this situation what the court did then was to do essentially what we often ask the arbitrator to do in the process of adjustment. 
    We ask the arbitrator to determine whether or not this new policy was in fact justified by the old, whether or not drug testing is important or not, whether or not there is some impact, for example, on employees. 
    Because the point that needs to be emphasized here is... in this situation the Court's role is only to determine the forum for deciding the dispute, not whether somebody gets a resolution of the dispute.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1223.167" stopTime="1229.071">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And I take it that this Adjustment Board itself can determine that it's a major dispute after it hears the evidence?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1229.071" stopTime="1241.295">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The Adjustment Board could determine precisely that. 
    It could say... it could contend in its findings, for example, that the drug testing program, as involved in this case, was not in fact justified by the prior practice.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1241.295" stopTime="1244.931">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is there explicit statutory authorization for that authority?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1244.931" stopTime="1271.564">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    There is no specific statutory authorization to determine a major dispute per se. 
    What the Adjustment Boards do is they simply determine the dispute in question between the carrier and the union. 
    And in doing that, they determine whether or not that practice was in fact justified. 
    The issue of major and minor, again, is a court-ordered decision. 
    That is, a court determination which has been developed in a series of circuit courts.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1271.564" stopTime="1284.755">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I thought that at some point the Adjustment Board could say, 
    "We've concluded that this is a major dispute and, therefore, that it is not within our purview to resolve. " 
    Am I incorrect?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1284.755" stopTime="1306.301">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    The characterization of what the Adjustment Board finds I think is incorrect in this respect... the Adjustment Board solely determines whether or not the current practice was justified by the prior practice in the course of deciding the grievance. 
    But it doesn't make a specific finding that a major dispute exists or a minor dispute exists in the process.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1306.301" stopTime="1309.170">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yeah, but it does decide whether it's within its jurisdiction.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1309.170" stopTime="1310.105">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    It certainly does do that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1310.105" stopTime="1318.659">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that's really... and if it thinks it's a minor dispute, it will decide it. 
    If it isn't a minor dispute, it won't.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1318.659" stopTime="1350.514">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Well, it would decide in either event. 
    For example, in other cases involving special boards of adjustment where they have considered the use of certain kinds of detection devices, the courts have seen fit to address the question of whether use of detection devices in aid of a rule was in fact justified by the prior practice. 
    But in concluding that they weren't, in some case, in a senses, your Honor, they are deciding that this was not justified and, therefore, it was not a minor dispute. 
    But, by the same token--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1350.514" stopTime="1352.282">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And not arbitrable.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1352.282" stopTime="1367.126">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --And in a sense not arbitrable. 
    But the Adjustment Board still was making a determination based upon a review of the past practice and the charge sought by the carrier. 
    And I think that is a critical component of the error of the court below in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1367.126" stopTime="1396.061">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But Mr. Morikawa, can I go back to Justice Scalia's concern about the statute? 
    Your argument seems to proceed as though this is all a judge-made doctrine. 
    But isn't it true that paragraph 7 says in so many words that the carrier cannot make a change in the rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees as a class except by following the bargaining procedure. 
    That is the definition of a major dispute, is making a change prohibited by that section unless you follow a certain procedure, isn't it?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1396.061" stopTime="1397.578">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That is essentially correct.

    That--
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1398.211" stopTime="1400.113">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    That's the operative provision that talks to that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1400.113" stopTime="1407.450">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --And so you have to convince us that this is not a change in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees as a class.

speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1407.450" stopTime="1417.991">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    Essentially correct. 
    That was part of the complaint below, that the action of adding the drug test was a change in the agreements between the parties with respect to--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    As a class and affecting the entire population, as opposed to a minor dispute with a particular employee who claims that he did or did not... or, there was or was not a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.

    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1428.696" stopTime="1432.232">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And why isn't this precisely that kind of change?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1432.232" stopTime="1473.375">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    It's not that kind of change, your Honor, because, as the courts have long recognized... a number of circuit court decisions which have considered it... if you are doing something which is consistent with your past-practice, that is at least arguably related to your past practice, then you have not made a change which violates Section 2 Seventh by definition. 
    And, by the same token, if it is a minor dispute, the courts... the cases recognize that the carrier has the right to continue to take that action whether or not it is subsequently bargained over between the parties. 
    This gets into the issue of the status quo that is supposed to exist at the time that bargaining occurs, for example. 
    This Court in Shore Line--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1473.375" stopTime="1517.688">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Morikawa, I know you haven't wanted to talk about this. 
    But if you're going to talk about it, I would think you would want to emphasize the phrase "as embodied in agreements". 
    It's not just changes in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of employees as a class. 
    But it's changes of pay... in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions as embodied in agreements. 
    And I suppose your argument is that unless the agreement specifically provides for something which the employer wants to change then it's a minor dispute. 
    If he wants to change the actual specific provision of the agreement, then you need a new agreement and that goes to the major bargaining provisions of the Act. 
    Isn't that the language that's crucial for you? 
    As embodied in agreements?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1517.688" stopTime="1535.902">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --As embodied in agreements certainly is the concept that we're discussing here. 
    As embodied in agreements... the language of embodied in agreements as interpreted by this Court has also been intended to include prior practices and customs broadly conceived between the parties that have been in existence at the time. 
    So, as a consequence--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1535.902" stopTime="1537.752">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And even if not spelled out?

    --Even if not--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1538.468" stopTime="1547.023">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Like with the bargaining agreement itself, nevertheless we regard it as part of it if it's part of the relationship in the past between the parties?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1547.023" stopTime="1600.575">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --Yes, your Honor. 
    The whole point is that not all agreements are specifically written down in form. 
    But, in fact, many of the agreements exist by practice and custom between the parties based upon the past practice. 
    And that's precisely the kind of agreements that we're talking about here. 
    The past practice being the right of Conrail to set these medical fitness for duty standards. 
    The question then was whether the addition of the drug test changed that agreement, or was it arguably, at least, related to that agreement in a way that it would allow an arbitrator to ultimately determine who was right and wrong. 
    And we find that in this case, your Honor, the Court proceeded to take that additional step to determine who was right and who was wrong and the consequences of that action. 
    And I think in doing that it usurped the function that arbitration plays in this process. 
    I'd like to close at this point and reserve my remaining time.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If I may just ask you one more question. 
    The Government's brief at page 9 says that if the Adjustment Board concludes that a dispute is a major one, it will issue an order to that effect and will remit the parties to negotiation and mediation under the statute. 
    Do you agree with that?

    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    We disagree with that, your Honor.

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1627.744" stopTime="1636.298">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you disagree that an adjustment Board can ever say this is a major dispute, we have no jurisdiction, we remit you to mediation? 
    That's wrong as a matter of law?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1636.298" stopTime="1647.306">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    --The Adjustment Boards do not make determinations, your Honor, with respect to the violations of the Act per se.

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1647.306" stopTime="1658.446">

    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    No. 
    The Adjustment Board, your Honor, in that situation would resolve the dispute in the context of the claims that exist between those parties.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1665.683" stopTime="1668.135">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, how can it do that if it's a major dispute?
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1668.135" stopTime="1673.373">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    It would not determine a major dispute because a major dispute would be something that would be subject to bargaining.

    By order of the Board.
speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="1701.189" stopTime="1755.324">
    Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa 
    It would not necessarily mean they would have to bargain. 
    It's really a question of choice on the part of the union or the carrier in this case. 
    If something is a major dispute, it doesn't necessarily mean that the parties must go out and then begin bargaining. 
    Bargaining begins by the initiation of a process in Section 6, which is a service of a notice initiating the process of bargaining. 
    In addition to that, the question of the particulars of a bargain that they may want to talk about may be the subject of a different version, completely different, from what the Adjustment Board may have characterized the dispute below. 
    So that in that sense the Adjustment Board's decision is not dispositive with respect to what is to be bargained in the future. 
    It's simply a determination of whether or not the parties dispute in this case was justified by the practice or was a new practice that was not contemplated by the original.

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    This case, although it arises in a sense out of a drug testing problem, is not really a drug testing case. 
    That's just the facts in it. 
    The real issue in this case is the jurisdiction of the federal courts to enforce the specific commands of the Railway Labor Act. 
    Now, going to those specific commands and what are involved here, we submit the first and most crucial command that's involved is Section 2 First of the Act, that the carriers exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements and to settle all disputes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1798.520" stopTime="1800.503">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    2 First, your Honor, is at page 131 of the Joint Appendix. 
    The crucial phrase in that is to exert every reasonable effort. 
    The second issue, or the second statutory provision that's involved, is Section 2 Seventh of the Acts which was added in the 1934 Act. 
    2 First was a part of the original 1926 Act, and it has remained unchanged since that Act was enacted. 
    2 Seventh was added in 1934 and it was added, according to its legislative history, to emphasize the intent of Two First and 6 that no change shall be made in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions as embodied in an agreements, except in the manner prescribed in the agreement or in the manner prescribed in Section 6. 
    That was, according to the legislative history... which you can go back to the Bankruptcy Act of '33 and the Emergency Transportation Act of '33, where this provision came from... the intent of that provision was to stop practices that had been going on where the carriers had been by bulletin suddenly changing the actual working conditions of the employees, claiming that they weren't in violation of the agreement, but just making the change.

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    On page 142... (1)... you go back into the indentation again. 
    It's right at the very bottom. 
    And in the middle of that paragraph what it basically... well, up in the early part... what it says is that disputes between an employee or group of employees and the carrier growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions are to be handled on the property up to the usual manner. 
    And then, if still unresolved, may be referred by either party to an Adjustment Board. 
    Now, a crucial factor of this particular section is that this is very unique, for this reason. 
    In the Railway Labor Act both the employer and the employees can refer a dispute over the interpretation or application of an agreement to the dispute resolution grievance procedure, the Adjustment Board process, the arbitration found... that you have under the NLRA. 
    And the NLRA, it's normally... sometimes limited to just the employees. 
    But in the Railway Labor Act, from the very beginning... and this was a provision that started in 1926 and actually predates that, as we explained it in our brief... it goes back to the railroad's control by the Federal Government in 1918. 
    Both parties to the dispute, if they are unsatisfied with the results on the property can have an outside force take a look at it and determine what the real meaning of the contract is.

    And that's... you take a look at 2 Seventh and it brings it out in this sense. 
    If 2 Seventh means that if you have a dispute over whether or not there is a change in what's going on, and whether that change is authorized, the dispute is basically this. 
    I say I'm authorized by the agreement to do it so, therefore, I'm not changing it. 
    You say I'm not authorized by the agreement so, therefore, it's a change.

    The carrier claimed that the bargaining notice was prohibited by the moratorium clause, which said that no notice on that subject would be served for this period of time. 
    And then they argued that since the question of whether our interpretation of the moratorium clause is correct, there is no obligation to bargain over the notice. 
    This Court rejected that by saying only one word need be said about that. 
    It's... It's impossible to talk about a proposal to change an agreement as not being what was covered by Section 6.

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    Yes, your Honor. 
    The change in this case was... there are two sets of rules that apply. 
    The medical fitness standards which the courts below found are in fact an implied agreement. 
    So we're... this is an agreement case. 
    Secondly, as Rule G, one the manner in which Rule G has been enforced, the implied agreement that the record shows exist is that Rule G is enforced solely by sensory observations of the supervisors and by particularized cause. 
    That goes into the question of the doctor and the doctor's taking of the test. 
    The difference between the two... and this is where the change comes in... is this. 
    Under medical fitness when someone is disqualified for medical fitness purposes, they are held out of service until the medical fitness problem dissipates or is cured or is somehow corrected. 
    Under Rule G, if you are found guilty of violating Rule G which simply prohibits the use of drugs or hallucinogens, alcohol or hallucinogens, while on duty or while subject to call, you are subject to discipline, which includes being fired. 
    Medical fitness never had discipline involved in it. 
    Under this standard, we now have 45 days to test negative or you're discharged.

    So, an Adjustment Board can make the determination that there is or is not a change. 
    What is done in the court is not in any way affecting the Adjustment Board's jurisdiction. 
    Now--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You support the use of the word arguable then, don't you?

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --I do for a limited type of test, your Honor. 
    Essentially what the union submits is that you have to look at 2 Seventh for the standard on the court's jurisdiction. 
    The courts clearly have the jurisdiction to enforce 2 First. 
    They clearly have the jurisdiction to enforce 2 Seventh. 
    Now, 2 Seventh said no change shall be made if there is a dispute over whether or not change is used in the statute. 
    And the legislative history makes it clear that whether or not a carrier claims a right under a contract to make the change is not the issue as to whether there is a change. 
    The change that--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That is not what 2 Seventh says. 
    It does not say all changes. 
    It says all changes in working conditions as embodied in agreements.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --for that? 
    Why not? 
    Because the agreement didn't say anything about that particular subject and, therefore, it's a change in the working conditions but not a change in working conditions as embodied in the agreement. 
    So, what's always at issue under 2 Seventh is whether it's a change in what had been agreed to.

    So you have to get to the issue of whether it's arguable that this was agreed to or not. 
    Not just whether it's arguable that this is a change.

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, it's not whether there's a change in what was agreed to. 
    It's whether there is a change that is affecting what is... what was agreed to. 
    That's what the legislative history makes clear.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2844.198" stopTime="2849.833">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I'm reading the statute. 
    It says working conditions as embodied in agreements.
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="2849.833" stopTime="2867.244">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    Yes, your Honor. 
    That was added in 1934 at the request of the railroads because they indicated that working conditions... the conditions of employment are specifically established by agreement. 
    Now, the point--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2867.244" stopTime="2882.490">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In which case is, is this a change in something that's been agreed to. 
    And if it arguably is a change in something that's agreed to, it's major... minor if it is clear that nothing that's been agreed to is being changed here, you don't have to go through a major renegotiation of the contract.
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="2882.490" stopTime="2969.779">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, there are two aspects that are being confused into one. 
    There is the question of notice. 
    What triggers the obligation of notice. 
    And the second question is what is the status quo obligation... that is in place... comes into place once the notice obligation is triggered. 
    What the legislative history shows is that language means... and this was added basically at the request of labor... that if the carrier is making a change that affects rates of pay, rules, or working conditions that are embodied in an agreement. 
    The clearest example are the line sales... even though it might not be prohibited by an agreement, a violation of the agreement, if what they are doing changes the working conditions. 
    And the prime example of that is the use of the legislative history of 1924 where Mr. Richberg explained the intent of this language. 
    And that was that where they... the contracts at that time had the expiration clauses that provided that they died at the end of a year unless 30 days prior to that time notice of change had been given. 
    And the purpose of the statute that they were proposing back in 1924, which was enacted as 2 First and 2 Sixth, was that even though the contract language said this is... you can change, you might make all your changes, they couldn't do it if what was being done would affect the rates of pay, rules and working conditions while that bargaining process was going on.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2969.779" stopTime="2975.166">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why isn't my locker room example covered by your theory? 
    Why don't you have to go through a major renegotiation for that?
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="2975.166" stopTime="2985.139">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    Because, your Honor, whether or not you report 15 minutes or a half hour later is not affecting the working conditions that are embodied in the agreement. 
    But where you change the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2985.139" stopTime="2986.890">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It affects working conditions, doesn't it?
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="2986.890" stopTime="2995.179">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --But not as embodied in an agreement. 
    And for that reason it is not one that requires notice. 
    But, assume that you get--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2995.179" stopTime="2996.429">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's... that's my point.
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="2996.429" stopTime="2996.846">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2996.846" stopTime="3001.483">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    When you put the stress in, as embodied in an agreement, it seems to me that's the other side's case.
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="3001.483" stopTime="3115.423">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    It is not, your Honor, for this reason. 
    If you interpret something as being... if there's a question as to whether there is a change in the literal use of that word that the Congress used, then you do have a question... we have to interpret the agreement first to determine if there's a change. 
    But where you clearly have a change and the carrier comes back and says, 
    "But it is authorized by the agreement. " 
    And that's the point we're getting to here. 
    They recognize that there is a new policy that was implemented. 
    It's clear that it's different than what they did before. 
    But they are coming in and saying, 
    "We have the right under our agreement with you to make this change. " 
    So, the difference between this case and the other case, the arguable standard which is the reverse of the NLRA's clear and patent breach of contract standard, or breach... is basically this. 
    Where you have a dispute as to whether the contract is being changed by what they're doing, the Adjustment Board has the ability in enforcing the contract to give complete relief to both sides. 
    But where the dispute is whether the change is authorized by the agreement... not whether the agreement is being interpreted properly... if the dispute is whether the change is authorized by the agreement, the only thing the Adjustment Board can say is that no, it's not, or yes, it is. 
    If the Adjustment Board says it is not, then what you have has been a change in working conditions that's not in the manner prescribed by Section 6, not in the manner prescribed in the agreement. 
    And that is a major dispute. 
    But, in the meantime, by the standards that the courts have been applying recently, adopting the arguable standard to this defense, defensive use of an agreement, is that the status quo obligation has been changed. 
    And the point that I'm trying to get to in all of this--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3115.423" stopTime="3119.060">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You... You don't support the reasoning of the Third Circuit then, although it ruled in your favor?
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="3119.060" stopTime="3219.943">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --We do, your Honor, in the sense... to this degree. 
    In this case it's not even arguable that there was in fact an authorization to make this change. 
    But the reason why we're presenting this standard, this view of Section 2 First and Sixth is that the courts have combined the status quo concept with the minor dispute concept and they've twisted things around. 
    The lower courts have twisted around. 
    And when you look at a dispute as being all major or all minor and never the twain shall meet, what you come up with is you adulterate the Act. 
    The Act was intended, from the very initial enactment in 1926, to put a status quo obligation on all disputes. 
    No change shall be made until the Act's processes have been completed is what the intent of the Act was. 
    In the initial 1926 Act minor disputes were also considered by the Congress. 
    The only difference was that minor disputes initially went to an Adjustment Board that could be set up by voluntary agreement. 
    And if that Adjustment Board was able to resolve it, well, that ended the problem. 
    But if the Adjustment Board didn't resolve it, it went immediately back... if any party requested... to the mediation process. 
    And from the mediation process to the Emergency Board process. 
    And during that entire processing no party shall make any change in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.

    Would it be consistent with what you've just said all the way through for the railroad to say after you filed your lawsuit, well, we didn't think there was any change here, we think we were just making a... pursuing a past practice that is implicitly authorized by the collective bargaining agreement? 
    But a dispute new seems to have arisen and therefore, pursuant to subparagraph (i), we will file some kind of a proceeding before the Adjustment Board and say, please tell us whether we are right or wrong about our reading of the agreement.

    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    That is correct, except for one problem. 
    We are now to this Court, for the first time, addressing the interplay between major and minor disputes. 
    And the point that we have to emphasize to this Court is that if the lower courts... and I don't just mean the Third Circuit, but all of the courts... standard is applied--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3319.106" stopTime="3321.141">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --There have been about five of them, have there not?
speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="3321.141" stopTime="3400.343">
    Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr. 
    --Well, your Honor, it's basically all of the... except possibly the Tenth Circuit... have adopted the arguable standard. 
    And we have no objection to the arguable standard where the Adjustment Board can give complete relief, it can resolve the entire dispute. 
    But where the Adjustment Board is one step in the resolution of the dispute, where if the Adjustment Board concludes that there is no contract authorization for what is going on... not that it violates the agreement, it changed the working conditions because you're taking away the man's seniority, but it doesn't violate it... then what you have is the Adjustment Board can say to the employees, 
    "Sorry, folks, we can't give you any relief because you haven't gotten the contract which prohibits what they're doing. " 
    The only thing that prohibits what they're doing is the statute, and the statute's status quo period. 
    So, what that means, when the Adjustment Board rules a couple of years down the pike, is that in the meantime all of this was being done in violation of the statute. 
    Now, Pitney, when this Court addressed the concept of minor dispute and the Court's jurisdiction, the Court said that where there is a clear violation of the statute the court should not withhold its hand. 
    But where there is a question as to whether there is a violation of the statute the court in the exercise of its equity discretion should withhold its hand and let the Adjustment Board resolve the case.
