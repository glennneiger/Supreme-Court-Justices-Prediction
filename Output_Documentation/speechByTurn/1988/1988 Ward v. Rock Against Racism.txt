    We'll hear argument next in No. 88-226, Benjamin R. Ward v. Rock Against Racism.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The opinion of the Second Circuit of the Court of Appeals is flawed in two respects. 
    It ignored the history leading up to the sound amplification guideline, along with the district court findings, most of which were based on uncontradicted evidence; and it applied the least restrictive alternative to suggest a hypothetical solution which had not been urged by either side up to the point of the circuit court of appeals' decision. 
    The bandshell, which is the subject of the sound amplification guideline, is located in the heart of Central Park. 
    It's surrounded by two major roads, Central park West and Fifth Avenue. 
    In both areas, it's heavily residential. 
    In addition, to the southwest of the bandshell within 150 yards, is the Sheep Meadow which was designated by the mayor as a quiet... a place for repose. 
    Individuals who go there cannot use radios. 
    They can only sit, read, et cetera.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    Between 1979 and 1986, Rock Against Racism conducted concerts in the bandshell. 
    During this period, there was a great deal of arguments between the city and the... and the RAR concerning the loudness. 
    The following occurred during the... during this period. 
    In 1983 the police attempted to lower the sound at the mixing board, and as a consequence, the sponsor got up and told the audience that the police were trying to lower the sound and it caused a confrontation. 
    There was some tension, and eventually the sound was lowered, and then it went back up. 
    This was the pattern each year. 
    There would be the interaction between the park officials and the promoter resulting in this tension each time.

    No. 
    There were two other... there were two other... It was one of the reasons. 
    The bleeding out of sound into the Sheep Meadow areas and in the residence was one of the grounds. 
    The two other reasons were that they wanted to unify the system of permits. 
    The bandshell is the most frequently used place in Central Park. 
    And as a result, it was a very diffuse process where the applications had to be made to many different entitles, and they wanted to centralize it in one person. 
    The second thing is that many of the groups who come to the bandshell are unfamiliar with outdoor concerts. 
    As a consequence they come with machines that are under-powered and many people don't even nave the machines, and want to know what the source would be to rent such machines. 
    So, the second purpose was to assure every group that participated in the bandshell that they would have the high-quality mechanics that would allow then to sponsor their broadcast.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    Precisely, Your Honor, indeed, if I can answer that in some depth. 
    That goes to the heart of the issue. 
    The testimony at trial was precisely that. 
    The city-hired sound consultant, Gary Floyd, has asked that both on direct and cross-examination. 
    What he pointed out is that when you reflect the mix, you do it based on your technical knowledge and the knowledge that you obtain by talking to the performers, that this happens all the time. 
    And that by doing sound checks in advance, sending out technical information to each of the performers and, in addition, by talking to them on the phone in advance of the concert and allowing the performer, if he desires, to set someone down next to you to give you the technical advice, you can reflect exactly what the mix is supposed to be. 
    Indeed, that's precisely what the district court found. 
    And when Alan Thompson, who was the technician for RA, testified, he pointed out precisely that's the method he used. 
    Two things I would like to elaborate on in response to your question. 
    First, one year they didn't even use Alan Thompson. 
    They rented out the equipment. 
    So, they used precisely the same type of program that we used. 
    The person came on, and he reflected the mix through the same process I just described. 
    In addition, Alan Thompson rented his equipment, and so... just as we rent our equipment. 
    So, it was very similar. 
    And finally--

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    --That is correct. 
    The sound technician is merely a mechanic, and he can reflect, as the testimony shows, within five minutes precisely what the performer wants. 
    When Alan Thompson, RAR's technician, was asked how he achieves the mix, he said exactly what Gary Floyd said. 
    He speaks to the performer, he does a sound check at the beginning of the concert, and finally he allows the performers to have a technician at his side in order to reflect the concert. 
    So, that's precisely right.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    Not only does the testimony confirm that, but the district court on two occasions reviewed that testimony. 
    The first time it specifically noted that the technician defers to the sponsor as to the mix. 
    And then RAR made a motion to clarify the order to determine who was to control the mixing board. 
    In response to that motion, the district court judge issued a second opinion in which he said as far as the regulation is concerned, the city is required... he read into the regulation a requirement that they defer to the sponsor on the mix. 
    And then he pointedly noted that there had been no evidence to indicate that the city could not reflect the mix properly. 
    And in addition, there had been evidence to indicate that the city could reflect. 
    And that was the overwhelming testimony.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    Yes, because when the sound consultant was given the job of considering alternatives, they considered, one, just having the city technician, but having the sponsor's equipment. 
    But then the mix would have suffered because a technician is only as good as familiarity with his equipment. 
    If he is not familiar with the equipment, he can't do the job. 
    So, that was rejected. 
    The other thing they thought about was negotiating a decibel level. 
    But they had tried that in 1984, indeed at the suggestion of RAR, and RAR, on the eve of a concert, did not agree to it and said that no decibel level would be appropriate. 
    Indeed, consistent with that, in the testimony by Alan Thompson, RAR's chief witness, when he was asked at what level it would be appropriate for the city to interfere with the concert, he said only when the audience's ears bleed, which gives you an idea of their reaction to any attempt on the part of the city to protect the unwilling listeners in the Sheep Meadow.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    That's correct. 
    Although I... what the record does show is that the technician, when he works both, he works them... it's done immediately. 
    So, these... these knobs are constantly being put up and down. 
    But you are quite correct. 
    There's nothing directly on point in that. 
    I do want to point out that in 1986, 50 to 60 concerts were held under this sound amplification guideline. 
    In terms of whether the city could protect the mix of the sponsor, every group was satisfied, some of whom used the New York Sound group that was designated as sponsor for outdoor concerts. 
    So, not only do we have a history and we have an expert that had been retained, but we have an in-fact use of this system, and every group reflected the mix... said that the mix had been reflected properly.

 You don't have any fancy... you just have old-fashioned musical instruments and in a living room or a smaller area. 
 And you have a regulation in this neighborhood you can't... you can't have excessive sound more than X number of decibels. 
 And you say it's too much trouble to enforce it by arresting people and putting them in jail. 
 So, you say, well, we'll insist on having cur own drummer in this band or our own trumpet player.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    That's right. 
    And if I may give an example, Justice Stevens. 
    If this individual was using an auditorium that had a built-in loudspeaker system, I suppose one could argue that depending on the nature of the loudspeaker system, it's affecting the quality of his performance. 
    But at some point you have to draw the line. 
    And with the mix and the loudspeaker system, the evidence shows that we can precisely reflect what the performer wants, whereas your example is a little more extreme, And, indeed, that's exactly what the district court found.

    Yes, I believe that's a method that may have been appropriate under your Court's test. 
    This Court has dealt with the appropriate standard with reviewing time, place and manner. 
    Time, place and manner presumes that there's going to be some limitation on free speech, but it recognizes that where there's a significant governmental interest, that the government has a right to make this limitation.

    Because as a practical matter, whenever you have a... a group that doesn't recognize sound limits, and you have a large audience there, and you have the city there, some things happen in the heat of battle that don't follow a normal, orderly plan. 
    Indeed, the Second Circuit recognized that when they themselves had trouble with their own suggestions because they recognized it dealt with... it depended upon negotiation and agreement, ability to get along. 
    Sc, they said as a last resort, pull the plug. 
    Well, pulling the plug penalizes the listeners who have come to the concert. 
    It's the most confrontational. 
    Yet, the circuit thought it was the least restrictive. 
    And, indeed, the district court in discussing that aspect found it to be the most restrictive because it stops the concert. 
    It is not our position that there aren't alternatives. 
    But each alternative is fraught with difficulty. 
    Any attempt to negotiate, which we had tried between 1983 and 1987 failed, and--

    --The record is... is a little unclear. 
    What the record shows, though, is that the mixer operates all of these in tandem. 
    And, indeed, Joseph Killian pointed out to support your conclusion, that many times concert promoters who are unfamiliar with outdoor concerts will use loudness to overcome the mixing problem so that they will make it loud as if that was the solution to properly reflecting the instruments. 
    Basically what the testimony is is that it's all on one board, and one person moves all the handles in a synchronized fashion. 
    So, whether it is possible to have two people sit side by side is unclear from the record. 
    What is not possible is to have a volume control separate and discrete from the mixing board. 
    That presents more problems than it resolves.

    --Absolutely, and the district court so found, and the circuit court upheld that particular portion. 
    Basically this was a solution after much consideration by the special projects director and the sound consultant expert. 
    And the reason for that is all the other methods that were selected with the exception of pulling the plug depended on the cooperation of each group. 
    And, frankly, with respect to this particular group, the cooperation had been less than the optimum during the preceding history. 
    So, what the city wanted to do... and they had two goals... was to have a program that would reflect the sponsor's views and at the same time assure uniform high quality.

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    What happens is Mr. Killian, who's a special events director... he attends every concert. 
    And he will go around the periphery of the bandshell and see whether or not the sound is bleeding into those areas. 
    He then will take the sponsor back there and tell the sponsor that it's too loud. 
    And they then will concur. 
    During 1986 there wasn't one problem for 50 to 60 events. 
    The only problem was the one with RAR where they had a dispensation because they had injunctive relief that allowed them to use their own concert mix. 
    With respect to the applicable case law, Heffron, Albertini and Clark, the test as we see to extrapolate from those cases is not whether or not the particular solution is the best, but whether or not it is effective. 
    Or does it serve the governmental interest in a substantial way? 
    In this case the record shows that what we did was effective. 
    Every group was satisfied that used it. 
    It shows that we controlled sound. 
    There were no more complaints from the residential areas or the Sheep Meadow. 
    And we preserved the interests of the unwilling listeners and we also preserved the sponsor's artistic integrity. 
    That is precisely what time, place and manner is supposed to do. 
    And for all those reasons, we ask that the sound amplification guideline be upheld. 
    I have not used all my time. 
    If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, reserve some of it for reply if necessary.

speaker="william_m_kunstler" startTime="1462.279" stopTime="1537.094">
    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    I want to start with agreeing in some respects with Justice Kennedy with reference to whether the... a conductor of a symphony orchestra is like the man who does the... the mix. 
    And I think they are very comparable. 
    The man that does the mix, as all the testimony indicates... I think on direct Mr. Thompson said he's part of the band. 
    There is no leader, of course. 
    He's part of the band. 
    And then the city's expert, Gary Floyd, stated that 
    "you have left the decisions and esthetic choices up to that individual. " 
    the technician at the console. 
    And I was thinking we put in our brief several... several analogies which I don't think are particularly apt such as mixing paints and so on, but I think there's a better analogy which would fit in with Justice Kennedy's question. 
    The analogy would be if they had symphony orchestras, as they do, play in Central Park, and Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic always played loud and therefore the city said, in order to control the noise, we're going to put Georg Solti in there because he's approved by everybody. 
    Everybody likes him.

    Well, I think that the testimony then is belied by the finding or the finding belied by the testimony because the court of appeals found that it was uncontroverted in the record, that the mixer is part of the band. 
    He's the esthetic leader of the band. 
    And I think if you will look on page 370 of the... of Fed. 2nd, you will find that the... that the unanimous court said it is uncontroverted in the record. 
    These claims are not controverted in the record, that the mixer is part of the band. 
    He is the esthetic leader. 
    And you have the city's own technician... own expert, Mr. Floyd... and I quote him here. 
    "You have left the decisions and esthetic choices up to that individual. " 
    the technician at the console. 
    It is on Joint Appendix 180. 
    So, we have a situation where everyone agreed that the mixer is not just a mere technician who turns some knobs automatically. 
    He is the leader of the band. 
    He's part of the band. 
    And to say that you're going to put the city leader of the Band in there, I think is very much like saying you're going to put Georg Sciti in because he plays andante and doice as against Zubin Mehta who plays loud because you're doing the esthetic mixing with reference to a city employee whom you must use.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    Well, I quoted to you what was said both by Alan Thompson and by Gary Floyd and what the court of appeals said about that. 
    I think the record does bear it out. 
    Now, with reference to the alternatives here, I... I was somewhat astonished to hear you say that it... you don't use alternatives in cases like this. 
    And I think Justice Stevens mentioned some. 
    There are five alternatives that our friends, the National Park Service and I thought their brief was more for us than for the appellant in this case... the... or the Petitioner. 
    The National Park Service says in its regulation... this is the Solicitor General's brief in... page 21... 
    "in implementing its regulation, the Park Service relies on a number of alternatives. " 
    ironically it's... they add, this doesn't include what the New York City Department of Parks does. 
    And there are five alternatives here that are possible short of putting in your own mixer. 
    One is a limiter. 
    It was testified to during the trial. 
    There's an automatic limiter you can put on the sound, like a governor on an engine. 
    Second, a separate sound control is perfectly feasible, separate and off the console, and the record indicates that. 
    Thirdly, ordinances, which they say they don't enforce. 
    But there are ordinances. 
    New York City has an anti-noise ordinance, and there are nuisance ordinances, breach of the peace ordinances and so on. 
    Fourthly, they can pull the plug. 
    That's one that the National Park Service uses. 
    And fifthly, they can negotiate--

    Yes, I do in... because I think they have a right to regulate sound. 
    Now, I have a problem with that because I know how much sound is part of the sound of a rock band, and I have a certain problem with it. 
    But for the sake of this argument, they have a right I think to control sound, and I would agree with that. 
    We're not raising the question that they don't have a right to control sound.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    No, they never had it, not these groups. 
    They never had it because they... there was a dispensation for them. 
    They got the... the injunction, and then they got the ruling of the court of appeals, Sc, there is nothing in record about that. 
    I might add that the one way that I think is most feasible is negotiating the decibel level. 
    And there's a misstatement in the reply brief of the Petitioner. 
    On page 8, they say the evidence also showed that RAR repeatedly violated agreed-upon sound levels in the face of repeated requests by police to reduce the sound. 
    That is untrue. 
    And if you look at the Joint Appendix references there, you will find nothing in there about agreed-upon sound levels at all. 
    They never proposed that. 
    In fact, as the court of appeals found... and I'm quoting from page 371... the city rejected the alternative of negotiating a decibel level for each event with the sponsor. 
    They rejected what would be the least intrusive and the least restrictive way, which would be negotiating a decibel level, which is exactly what the National Park Service does. 
    That's one of their recommended alternatives. 
    And, Justice Scalia, I think that is the most feasible way. 
    You don't intrude. 
    You don't force them to use a conductor they don't want or a sound mixer they don't want. 
    And you negotiate a decibel level. 
    It was never done in this case.

    Well, there are... just what the Park Service says it does. 
    Number one, the Park Service says... and they spell it out very clearly... that when the volume gets over the level, they send over a representative or a ranger, park ranger, who says you're over it. 
    Stop it. 
    And if they don't stop it, then you have the alternatives of criminal actions. 
    You have the alternatives of pulling the plug, which I would say... agree with you should be the last in any concert.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    Justice Scalia, a policeman cannot judge decibel level without an instrument. 
    There was never an instrument used here at all. 
    There is a way to measure decibel level. 
    The Park Service uses it. 
    The police department is not equipped to do that, and they didn't do it.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    But, Justice Scalia, I think what you're saying is unrealistic. 
    What happens in a dorm or in a residential house, when a party gets too loud and the policeman says it's too loud, is different as to whether rock music or music is bleeding into another area. 
    And they have tests to show I think... it's not in the record, but I'll tell you what I found, that 110 decibels is the proper decibel limit not to go into the Sheep Meadow. 
    And I think when you've got to... when you've got a thing like this, you can't use the analogy of a private party.

    I don't think it's a comparable situation, You're really not talking so much on... although I agree thoroughly with Justice Marshall's definition and analysis of sleep in conjunction with the plight of the homeless in Lafayette Park, but here you're dealing with something else. 
    You're dealing with an expression, an oral expression protected by the First Amendment. 
    And I think you can make an argument, as you did, that sleep is not such an oral expression. 
    But I think here you're dealing with an oral expression. 
    I don't really think this is a time, place and manner case at all. 
    I think this is a case, can you control artistic expression by using a state employee.

 So, you would make basically the same argument if this was just you didn't have the mix to make it more of an artistic thing, but you just say the part of the artistic presentation is the sound volume, and we do not agree that you can have a state employee sitting with his thumb on the... on the button.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    And, Justice Stevens, sound is an integral part of the artistic expression of rock groups. 
    There's no question about it. 
    And so, I didn't want to give the impression... I guess I did... that I agree that constitutionally you can just control noise. 
    All I am saying essentially that you can create situations where you have ordinances against... I think in the Kovacs case it said loud and raucous noise in sound trucks. 
    And I think this Court has held a number of times that that can be controlled, not by a man at the console, but by ordinances and criminal actions.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    No, that wasn't my point, that they would insist upon it. 
    They would set the decibel limit, and then the band, in order to control itself and keep under... from coming under the criminal statutes, could use the limiter or the governor on the band. 
    I wasn't suggesting the state could do it at all. 
    And I'm not even suggesting, Justice White, it's the best thing for artistic music. 
    I think the best thing is to negotiate decibel lengths... or limits the way the parks department does... National Park Service... and then enforce the law. 
    They've never enforced the law here. 
    They've never even negotiated the limits even though they say in their brief that they do.

    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    No, I don't remember any testimony about decibel level being feasible for rock music or unfeasible or nonfeasible for rock music. 
    But I notice in the Park Service regulations and in the Solicitor General's brief that they have rock concerts at national parks, many of them, and that they establish a decibel level. 
    They monitor it through a... an expert or a ranger or what have you, and they have all those alternatives. 
    They use the word "ironically" about what could happen here, and I think it is ironic that they're attempting really to become part of the band, to have a state official as part of the band.

    Justice Scalia, I don't think it's hard to post someone at the Sheep Meadow who has ears and can hear if it's bleeding in. 
    In fact, you will find in the record here, in the preliminary record, there was a man named Mr. Schulman who was their expert during the preliminary injunction hearings who said he stood at Central Park West and here's his testimony. 
    He said he had a man standing there. 
    He could hardly hear it. 
    That's on page 449 of the first... the Joint Appendix, Volume II of the Joint Appendix. 
    They can monitor that easily enough. 
    That's just as much as a policeman standing outside your dorm who here's it bleed into other parts of the college. 
    I assume this was in college, but I won't press you on it.

    But the point is it's easy to have someone stand at the Sheep Meadow. 
    That has been designated since this all began as a quiet zone by Mayor Koch. 
    To have someone stand there. 
    If it's getting into the Sheep Meadow, then you don't even have to care about decibels. 
    It's going too far. 
    But you can negotiate. 
    They can negotiate decibel limits. 
    And I agree; different instruments are different.

    --on a particular day. 
    So, just negotiating a decibel limit is not by itself enough, because you can... I think Justice Stevens correctly says that wind has a big factor. 
    The humidity has a factor. 
    Everything plays a factor as Alan Thompson testified. 
    But then you have someone stand at the Sheep Meadow at the outskirts or on Central Park West or Central... or Fifth Avenue. 
    If it gets over there, it's beyond... it doesn't matter what the decibel limit is, it's beyond what it should be.

speaker="william_m_kunstler" startTime="2885.225" stopTime="3075.765">
    Mr. William M. Kunstler 
    I guess that would be it. 
    I've heard the Philharmonic, but the Philharmonic works in a much bigger auditorium where sound is dissipated, like Carnegie Hall. 
    A rock band usually plays in the Bitter End or in a small room where you have close confinement, and they do love it loud. 
    No question about it. 
    My daughter... well, I won't go into that. 
    [Laughter] 
    In any event, I think they... what they've done here... I think... I don't think this is just time, place and manner. 
    I think this is a pure First Amendment freedom of expression case. 
    They want to put Georg Solti in for Zubin Mehta, essentially, even though this is a different type band and say everybody loves Georg Solti. 
    He's a city employee. 
    We all love him. 
    Many have heard him, and therefore he's the man that's going to do it. 
    And, Zubin Mehta, you stay out of the park because that's really what they're saying. 
    The sound mix man... despite what Justice Kennedy tells me is not in the record, the sound mix man in the record is classified as part of the band as the esthetic creator. 
    And in fact, you'll find in their own brief they talk about the city, and the Petitioner's brief talks about the fact that there is a... an esthetic balance that the mixer does. 
    In the Solicitor General's brief, there's one very interesting statement, which occurs on page 15. 
    The Solicitor General says, 
    "Here it could be said that the city's sound amplification guideline prohibits outright those aspects of artistic expression which are inherent in the selection and direct control of the bandshell's sound system. " 
    "There's the Solicitor General's brief that they say are in... prohibit outright those aspects of artistic expression. " 
    And that's what we have here. 
    It's a sul generis case where the state is trying to essentially mix the sound of the band, a state employee using state-hired equipment. 
    And the fact that that man may satisfy others, that New York Sound may satisfy others... others like it, does not mount to a hill of beans here. 
    It's not what satisfies others; it's what satisfies the RAR and the bands which it employs. 
    In fact, on page 16 of the Petitioner's brief, they recognize the "esthetic balancing" of New York Sound, and that New York Sound showed "remarkable sensitivity to that problem". 
    Well, that problem is what you have in this case, the problem of whether the state is going to mix the sound, under the First Amendment, of rock bands and that that satisfies the First Amendment. 
    I don't think it does, and I don't think any of your cases really have met this problem as to superimposing a state official to manipulate and to run esthetic balancing of rock bands.

    I know that's cited by the adversary here. 
    I think you've got a... a pure First Amendment situation here. 
    The judge in his findings did not dispute the fact it was an esthetic mix, and that the... someone sitting next to the sound technician cannot do the trick. 
    Alan Thompson testified that you cannot do the trick. 
    You have to do it yourself. 
    And they allow five minutes a band here. 
    If you notice, they have 45 minutes for, I think, eight or nine bands. 
    And you just can't even get the drift in five minutes of these rock bands, which are very sensitive. 
    This is all electronic music, and the mix is crucial to it. 
    It's more crucial to it than with the Philharmonic which doesn't use... thank God... electronic equipment, but uses the... I think someone said... Justice Stevens... the old-fashioned instruments.

   Rebuttal of Leonard J. Koerner

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    One of the problems with this case is that the Respondent has just carried his burden of going forward which he didn't do at the trial court. 
    A lot of statements he made do not... are not reflected in the record. 
    First, with respect to a decibel level, he indicated we never tried to negotiate a level. 
    That is inaccurate. 
    At page 343 and 384, it says quite clearly that in 1984 we suggested a decibel level, which was precipitated by their inquiry as to whether or not we should have one. 
    And when we agreed to try it as a test, they didn't show up to try to revise it, and then took the position that any decibel level would violate their constitutional rights. 
    So, we tried that alternative, and it was because of their stubbornness, not ours, that it wasn't given a fair test. 
    Second, with respect to the mix itself, Gary Floyd, our sound consultant, did not say that the mix is part of the band. 
    At 180 to 181, what he specifically said was a good mixer can reflect the band's artistic inclinations within five minutes. 
    Second, Alan Thompson, the Plaintiff's own witness... I would like to just read this. 
    It will only take a second, but it summarizes our case because he did not disagree. 
    In asking to describe how he mixes at the board, he said specific--

    Mr. Leonard J. Koerner 
    --At the bottom of page 100 to the top of 101 of the Joint Appendix. 
    "Yes, I am at the board, and basically during the performance I am part of the band, because I am balancing all of their instruments together to sound right to their taste. " 
    "How do you know what their taste is? " 
    "They have their manager and their own sound mixer present at my elbow. " 
    "Or they tell me what they want previously. " 
    And he goes on. 
    That's precisely what we do. 
    And that is why the district court confirmed that we could reflect the mix. 
    With respect to the sound itself as to why we didn't set a decibel level, that was one of the options considered by our consultant. 
    But the reason he didn't set a general decibel level is because it varies based on foliage, temperature and crowds. 
    And, therefore, a decibel level for each... for each event would not be appropriate and it may not even be appropriate for the very event you set ore because the crowds keep forming. 
    As the crowds get larger, the decibel level would have to be changed. 
    And, therefore, there would be no objective standard they could count on. 
    Finally, with respect to the separate volume control, which has now come up as a suggestion because it was mentioned by the Second Circuit, that was never mentioned up to the point of the decision of the Second Circuit. 
    No one ever suggested a separate volume control. 
    And, in fact, such a control would cause more problems than it would solve because a control such as that would have to be hooked into each mixer that was brought to the many concerts held at the bandshell. 
    As a consequence, those mixers would have to be compatible. 
    To the extent that the mixers are not compatible, we would not be able to offer the event. 
    Second, if you did have a separate volume control, far and away from the mixer, basically what you could have is competing controls. 
    Each time we lowered the sound, an individual at the mixing board would be able to manipulate his portion through the amplifiers and nullify the competing controls. 
    Finally, in addition, by having a separate volume control, it would cause a signal loss in the mixer and could upset the balance of the mix. 
    So, frankly, that particular solution would actually affect the esthetics, and it would... should be the least desirable. 
    And that is why the city chose the method it did and why it was accepted by every person that used it for... in the year 1986. 
    Thank you.
