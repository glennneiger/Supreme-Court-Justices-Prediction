speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="55.753">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The other case, Goldberg versus Sweet, No. 87-1101, is appealed from the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    This case, we hold that the Illinois Telecommunications Excise Tax does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause and challenge tax on interstate telecommunications is falsely apportioned. 
    It does not discriminate against interstate commerce. 
    It is fairly related to services and benefits produced by the State of Illinois. 
    The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is, thereby, affirmed. 
    Justice Stevens and Justice O?Connor have each filed separate concurring opinions, and Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
