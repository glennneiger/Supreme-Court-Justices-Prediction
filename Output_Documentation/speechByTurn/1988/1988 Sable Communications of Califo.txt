Sable Communications of California v. Federal Communications Commission

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-515, Sable Communications of California v. FCC; and 88-525, Federal Communications Commission v. Sable. 
    Mr. Taranto?

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    These cases in involve facial challenges to the constitutionality of Congress' 1988 legislation aimed at commercial telephone pornography. 
    Section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as it was amended in 1988, prohibits any person from making any obscene or indecent interstate telephone communication for commercial purposes. 
    Sable challenged both the obscenity and indecency prohibitions on their face. 
    The district court, on a motion for preliminary injunction, held the obscenity prohibition valid and the indecency prohibition invalid. 
    Our position is that both challenges should have been rejected. 
    As to obscenity, which is not protected by the First Amendment, the short answer to Sable's objections, concerning how the statute is to be applied, is that they are insufficient to support a facial challenge, because the statute plainly is capable of constitutional application. 
    As to indecency, the statute is justified by a distinctive combination of factors similar to those relied on in the broadcasting context in Pacifica: the accessibility of the telephone medium to children, the compelling governmental interest in preventing children, especially younger children, from hearing patently offensive sexual speech, especially in the privacy of the home, the reasonable congressional judgment that no lesser measure would reliably prevent children's access, and the availability of alternative sources of such speech for adults who wish to obtain it.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --although this kind of pornographic material, I think, probably hadn't... certainly does not meet the last of those criteria. 
    But the prurient appeal definition that this Court elaborated in Brockett against Spokane, we think, narrows the range of even sexually explicit material that is covered by obscenity. 
    So it is entirely possible that there is a fair volume of indecent material that would not rise to the level of obscenity because the prurient appeal definition of Brock... of Brock might not be met. 
    But the short answer to your question about the factual record is that we simply don't know of the millions and the tens of millions of calls made each year, what percentage of those would be obscene, what percentage would be indecent, and what percentage would be neither obscene nor indecent.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Well, even without legislative history, it seems to me the fairest assumption, when Congress used the term indecency, is to look to what this Court had... had said, and this Court's case on indecency in Pacifica. 
    And there, both the Commission in that case and in numerous subsequent administrative proceedings, has adhered to a standard definition of patently offensive sexual speech. 
    I would like to explain the background of section 223 (b), because that background is important to understanding both the aims of the statute and why the statute is no broader than necessary to achieve those aims. 
    The telephone pornography industry was born in 1983. 
    As a result of newly available technology, providers of pre-recorded, sexually-explicit messages, like Sable, could disseminate those messages on special, 976 lines to thousands of callers simultaneously, and to hundreds of thousands of callers a day. 
    The providers of this so-called dial-a-porn use the telephone companies to do their billing. 
    The telephone company collects a special charge per minute or per call and pays the provider a share. 
    The market for sexual telephone messages grew rapidly. 
    In 1984, 180 million calls were made to dial-a-porn in New York alone. 
    By 1988 the industry was estimated to gross more than $2 billion a year.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="407.085" stopTime="417.790">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Taranto, under law, are the telephone companies required to accept these people as customers, or is it a voluntary contractual arrangement?
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="417.790" stopTime="628.681">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    It is my understanding that each of the telephone companies is, as part of its non-discrimination obligation, required to accept... accept these. 
    But I can't say with certainty whether that's so in each state. 
    I know of no state which... in which a telephone company has refused to accept these, and has been upheld in doing so. 
    From the beginning of this new industry it was clear that children had ready access to dial-a-porn, and that the messages contained a wide range of graphic descriptions of sexual acts, many of those acts involving minors. 
    In 1983 Congress enacted the first version of section 223(b) to attack the problem. 
    The statute banned obscene and indecent commercial telephone communications to minors. 
    It directed the FCC to devise regulations that would try to separate adults from minors in the calling audience. 
    And it provided that compliance with such regulations would be a defense under the statute. 
    The FCC then undertook a four-year effort to promulgate regulations that would accommodate Congress' competing goals, to try to prevent access by minors while not unduly restricting adults' access to dial-a-porn. 
    The Commission first proposed a defense based either on use of a credit card to pay for the call, which was not feasible for pre-recorded telephone messages, or on restriction of the messages to evening and... and night-time hours. 
    In the challenge brought by Sable's affiliate, Carlin, the Second Circuit invalidated the time-of-day restriction as essentially ineffective, noting how little time it took for a minor to make a call, and the availability of dial-a-porn by long-distance calls to other time zones. 
    On remand the Commission added a second defense based on the dial-a-porn providers requiring callers to punch in an access code to hear the message. 
    Based on comments from Carlin and others, Carlin, in fact, stated children intent on acquiring a code will certainly be able to do so. 
    The Commission recognized the problem that minors might obtain access codes. 
    And the Commission, therefore, required that access codes be made available only through the mail and cancelled upon notification of improper use. 
    In the same proceeding, the Commission also rejected various kinds of blocking as technologically infeasible, unduly expensive, over-inclusive in their impact on non-sexual 976 telephone messages, and ineffective in preventing minors' access. 
    After another court challenge by Sable's affiliate and another remand from that challenge, the Commission promulgated a third set of regulations, adding a third defense based on the providers scrambling of its messages. 
    Once scrambled, the message could be de-scrambled by a simple $15 to $20, pocketwatch-size device held up to or attached to the earpiece on the phone. 
    Again, based on comments submitted in the administrative proceeding and reiterated by Sable in its challenge in the Second Circuit, the Commission recognized that minors might be able to obtain de-scramblers, as it previously recognized with respect to access codes. 
    In the end, though, the Commission came to rest on the three defenses, requiring credit card payment, access codes or scrambling, as the best, available implementation--

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    I believe that... that the Commission was stating a conclusion about the effectiveness of reaching an inherently compromised goal, a goal that said, keep children out, but make sure adults can... can continue to gain access to the material. 
    And I think all of its rulings in the first, second and third reports, in order, need to be read with that goal in mind. 
    The Commission was not looking for the single, most effective method of keeping children... but preventing unsupervised access by children. 
    It always had in mind the competing congressional goal of ensuring that adults could... could continue to have access. 
    So it may well be that the Commission did, at various points, state, at least with respect to credit cards, although there it was talking only about live calls, that that would be an effective way of preventing children's access.

    As long as one had the first part of the congressional command in place, it was never the Commission's focus to looks for effective technological alternatives, only to get at the second goal. 
    Because Congress... it understood Congress to say, don't do anything unduly to restrict adults' access.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Well, it would certainly be harder case if... if the facts presented were a choice between a ban that made sure no minors got access, and a handful. 
    I think we would then... we then... we would then have questions like those that arise... that arose in time, place and manner cases, like Community for Creative Non-Violence, where the question was, just how far can the Park Service go in... in, you know, in keeping a park... preserving a park for specified uses. 
    This record, I think, quite amply justifies the conclusion that we don't have a choice between a near-perfect and a perfect measure.

    --Well, in... in the 1983 statute, Congress old use the term minor, and I assume used in... in the normal sense of 18 or under. 
    In the current statute there is no reference to minors. 
    The question is, we're talking about minors because of the congressional concern. 
    That concern surely is of diminished force as... as we are talking about 17... 17-year-olds.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --Well, not... not as easily. 
    But I think that... that children of age 1O or 11, as indeed the anecdotal evidence submitted to Congress and the Commission show, have shown a very strong interest in calling up these dial-a-porn services and getting a three or four-digit access code, or getting a credit card number, or picking up a small de-scrambler that just needs to be held up to the earpiece of a telephone, is, we think, not a... a very difficult measure for... for children. 
    And, indeed, Sable and its affiliates have, throughout the administrative proceedings, urged the proposition that these measures are, in fact, ineffective, that children would be able to... to circumvent... easily circumvent all of these measures. 
    So we think that... that it was well within Congress' usual range of fact-finding discretion to determine that the loopholes left by various technological alternatives were very substantial loopholes, and that we weren't just talking about a handful of minors, monthly or annually, who would be able to gain access, but a very significant number.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Yes. 
    There are some extremely lurid consequences of... of this... of this telephone pornography. 
    Let me just say one word about the obscenity challenge. 
    We think it is a sufficient answer that this is a facial challenge, and that Sable's objection to the obscenity portion is not that obscenity is protected, but that speech that is not obscene in Los Angeles might be disseminated in some other community where it is obscene. 
    It is a sufficient answer, I think, to that challenge, just to note that the... the statute is clearly capable of constitutional application... or prosecution in Los Angeles, even under Sable's view of... of the statute, and that no other party is differently situated. 
    And so under Taxpayers For Vincent and other cases, there is no third party overbreadth claim here. 
    Any challenge that Sable has regarding its... the obscenity portion should and must be raised only, in an as-applied challenge. 
    I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Argument of Laurence H. Tribe
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="1611.550" stopTime="1722.923">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Let me begin with the question that you, Mr. Chief Justice, asked Mr. Taranto, and with Justice Scalla's follow-up concern, because, until now, this case has been litigated in terms of the interest of children. 
    But I do understand the question, mightn't Congress have had... or mightn't this Court in hindsight attribute to Congress, another legitimate purpose, protecting common carriers from the distasteful obligation of carrying messages that, in some cases, as Justice Scalia suggests, are just short of obscene, although in other cases, as with many of the portions of the Carlin tape, are probably far short of obscene. 
    That interest is an important one, I think, to examine, even if Congress didn't have it in mind, though I wouldn't concede that it would be appropriate to hold the law on that basis. 
    The fact is that most courts have not treated telephone companies in this context as common carriers. 
    Pacific Bell has debated whether it will carry these messages; for the time being, it does. 
    Mountain State said no. 
    And the Ninth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Sneed, in Carlin Communication against Mountain State, said that when you have these messages that can reach lots of people at once, the phone company doesn't have to be treated as a common carrier. 
    It declined to construe state law as requiring that pornographic messages, even lawful ones, be carried. 
    Southern Bell similarly refused, and the Fifth Circuit said that it didn't have to carry them. 
    And both Circuits said there was no state action. 
    So the premise that Mr. Taranto has, that perhaps Congress might be upheld on another ground, I think just can't be sustained. 
    So we do have to focus on children--

    Indeed, Judge Sneed did take the position that when they refuse under threat of prosecution, then the First Amendment comes into play.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Not absolutely and authoritatively settled, Justice Kennedy, but I think implausible to sustain this law on that ground, first, because it's likely they wouldn't be so required. 
    Second, because that wasn't one of Congress' reasons. 
    Third, because even if there is some such requirement, that requirement is purely a product of state law. 
    And for this Court to uphold a law that outright bans and criminalizes concededly protected speech in order to hypothetically protect some possible potential common carriers from a state law obligation, seems something of a stretch.

 And... and If... If that statute is... is not constitutional, then we are right back to this question, because the next question could be, would a statute be permissible allowing the option to the company to refuse indecent calls.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="1908.912" stopTime="2052.315">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    In any event, that would surely be a less restrictive alternative for Congress. 
    But if Congress were to say that a company may refuse to carry certain kinds of messages, and in that way were to try to relieve them of the burden, the adverse impact on protected speech by message providers would be considerably less. 
    Because it would depend on a later adjudication of whether that law was valid. 
    With respect to children, I think the important and quite universally recognized point, and we certainly have to concede it, is that when a category of speech is protected for adults but might harm children, there are not may ways that government can absolutely rule out any possible child access. 
    There are three broad approaches government can take. 
    It can try to channel or zone the speech into times and places where parents can supervise exposure. 
    This Court authorized, for example, banning the sale of adult magazines, even not quite obscene ones, to minors in Ginsberg, in Pacifica. 
    Although it certainly didn't authorize outright criminalization, it said that one could take a radio station's careless daytime broadcast of dirty words into account in the licensing context. 
    One could rely, as this Court said, one had to, in Bolger, on parents to intercept potentially indecent condom ads at the mailbox. 
    That's one approach. 
    Now, a second approach is to screen. 
    That is, one can require that the speech, which is unsuitable for children, be coded or scrambled, or otherwise made accessible only to people who have some special information or device. 
    And then one can make it illegal for minors to obtain that device. 
    You could require lockboxes on cable t.v., and, of course, there is the FCC's 1987 approach. 
    Now, these two approaches aren't perfect. 
    Children are not chained to their parents. 
    Parents may be busy or distracted. 
    Kids can go next door. 
    All locks and codes can be broken by someone enterprising enough. 
    And so it's tempting sometimes to take the next steps and to ban the speech outright by criminal law so that not even willing adults can get it, which is the approach of this... of this statute.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I think the search for that kind of limiting principle is important. 
    Because, I think, as your question recognizes, otherwise the government could use a flat ban to reduce the messages reachable by phone to those that are fit for children. 
    The same rationale, namely, some kid will get through, could be used to eliminate the sale of indecent, but not obscene, books, magazines, films, videos, HBOs, and the like. 
    Indeed, much of what is here described as just short of obscene is not distinguishable from a lot of what's in R-rated movies, and lots of racy novels. 
    So it is important to ask whether there is something distinctive about dialing a phone that would justify this content-based law, which is certainly not narrowly tailored. 
    I mean, after all, most of what it outlaws is an adult deliberately dialing a call, not being harassed by anyone. 
    And so, let me... let me turn to that.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    The decision in Carlin III raised one question about that, that I think I ought, in candor, to focus on. 
    And that is, the Second Circut in Carlin III suggested that it is legitimate unless and until even less restrictive alternatives become available. 
    And they were talking primarily about a beep tone approach, under which the default position would be that the message could get through unless the parent installed, for $5 or so, and that is now feasible I understand, a beep tone device in the phone so that it wouldn't get through. 
    But it seems to me that the combination don't want to be... I don't think one should get distracted with the technological wizardry of all this. 
    The fundamental proposition is that there is nothing distinctive about phones. 
    If anything, it cuts the other way. 
    It's much easier to police the phone, either in your own house or in a neighbor's house, than it is to police a kid looking in somebody else's closet for old copies of Playboy or old centerfold, or turning on the HBO. 
    At least some parent is going to have a monthly bill from Sable or Carlin... actually, from the phone company, indicating use of a service by Sable or Carlin.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Yes. 
    Certainly, as a less restrictive alternative than a flat ban. 
    It agrees that they are legitimate unless and until a less restrictive alternative, still, becomes available. 
    But certainly, their availability makes this flat ban illegitimate. 
    Let me return to Justice Scalla's question about the terrible... the rape of that 12-year-old. 
    Some of the stuff, which is either obscene or not obscene, in any medium, night be associated with terrible, terrible tragedy. 
    That isn't, I think, denied. 
    The question really is can one, as a result, in dealing with non-obscene material which the government admits is protected for adults, wipe it out from the whole medium on the theory that it's somehow distinctive. 
    The fact is, if you can do it to the telephone, you can do it to pictures of nudity or violence that are not suitable for minors, that might give them terrible ideas, but that are protected for adults. 
    They can be every bit as tempting and corrupting for children, both in print and on film. 
    There are other suggestions the government makes for somehow trying to limit the precedent that think it realizes could be terribly dangerous. 
    They suggest repeatedly in their brief that what's distinctive about the phone in your home, to which you referred, Justice Scalla, is that it is somehow immune to control for age at the point of sale. 
    That is, unlike the neighborhood magazine store or the neighborhood movie theater, where there is somebody in the window and where, unless you're pretty close to 18, you can't very well pass for 18, though you can sneak in, the government says that there's no live vendor at the telephone, and therefore no check at the point of sale. 
    And therefore, it's distinctive. 
    And we could, therefore, justify a sort of limited ruling saying that on the telephone you can reduce adults to what is suitable for minors. 
    I think that that's quite a canard. 
    I mean, the fact is that the FCC's safeguards, the combination of requiring a credit card or an access code, or scrambling the message, would interpose live vendors. 
    When you go to get the credit card or the access code or the de-scrambler. 
    The picture of the world that is painted by the government in its brief is that these children are so enterprising they can steal their parents' credit cards, they can sneak into someplace and buy this de-scrambling device, but somehow, despite that, they're not going to manage to see the same thing on adult... in adult magazines or somewhere else. 
    The fact is you have to buy an adult magazine even to get the telephone number of one of these companies. 
    So the idea that the absence of a live vendor is decisive, I think, is fallacious. 
    It's especially fallacious since the government's own argument shows that the harm comes not from the purchase, but from the peek. 
    The harm is exposure. 
    It doesn't matters who bought it, if the child goes across the street and looks at the centerfold at the age of five or six, or reads some dirty jokes, that can be disruptive of development in exactly the same way. 
    The issue, therefore, has nothing to do with the vendor, it has to do with the parent. 
    And are we going to have government, basically, displace parents, because parents are not... are not perfect?

    --But does it matter whether it comes into your ear through the telephone or through the air in front of you when you put it on a record player or a tape recording? 
    Are we now going to say, as it would follow from that question, I think, that if a record or a tape contains suggestive or salacious language, or is somehow erotic, though not obscene, it certainly would be disruptive for a five-year-old or a 10-year-old to hear, that we can't sell It? 
    Because if you sell it down the street, some 15-year-old may buy it, and the five-year-old may borrow it. 
    It seems to me that that is an illimitable position, profoundly dangerous to the First Amendment.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --It might well be all right if large numbers of children could, in any event, get a hold of it I was about to give the example of skywriting. 
    There are some things that, just by the nature of it, when they're up there, everybody can equally see them. 
    And you can't filter out some people. 
    But it is simply fallacious to suggest, as the government does, that we're dealing here with anything remotely of that sort. 
    That is, all of the evidence about the hundreds of calls that came in, came from a period when there were no FCC safeguards in place. 
    The primary quotation they rely on in their brief is from Brent Ward, U.S. Attorney In Utah. 
    And he said that there were hundreds of calls from parents of minors who complained to Carlin's New York City telephone service. 
    But those calls occurred without any safeguards at all. 
    And if you ask what Brent Ward, their primary witness on this subject, testified before Congress, he said this, and we quote him at page 9 of our brief, "The access code requirement", I'm quoting, 
    "The access code requirement and the screening option would dramatically reduce the number of calls from minors, almost eliminating them. " 
    "It would be a very effective way to do it. " 
    That's his language. 
    Now, the government says, but that's only because they have a compromised goal. 
    The compromise, as Justice O'Connor suggests, is with the Constitution, with the First Amendment. 
    They say, if you really have an unalloyed goal, then you can say that there is no less restrictive alternative. 
    But the alloy that they would remove is the alloy of the First Amendment. 
    That is, quite clearly, if you give any weight at all to the importance of not preventing adults from a medium ultimately indistinguishable from others, from having access to material that is protected as to them, then this is an overly broad law.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --They had no... they were frustrated, Justice White, because there was this long colloquy between the relevant administrative agency, the FCC, and the Second Circuit, lasting for about five years, going back and forth. 
    And it was in early April of 1988 that the Second Circuit finally came down in Carlin III and said, you've... you've done it you've solved it. 
    Within days... within days Congress voted this flat ban. 
    The hearings were held months before Carlin III came down. 
    So Congress probably thought, if you ask me to speculate, that the Second Circuit was forever going to frustrate the FCC and that it was just going to cut through all of the red tape, and since it didn't value this stuff much anyway, and since it thought, perhaps, that it knew what it was outlawing, although, with I'm not sure exactly what it was outlawing, because these terms are not self-defining--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, the... they, I believe, agreed with Brent Ward, that it would almost eliminate calls from minors. 
    And these are calls, I do want to get back to the suggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is just a teensy-weensy bit short of completely unprotected. 
    I don't think there's anything in the record that... that shows that. 
    After all, the... the government says, in page 5 of its brief, that this criminalizes calls even when the... when the message is only suggestive, not sexually explicit, even when there's no prurient appeal at all. 
    And in oral argument, they say that represents, they think, a fair volume. 
    Even when... and they... to answer Justice Stevens, they go to the Pacifica case to say, well, what does indecent mean? 
    Of course, Pacifica dealt with, the Carlin, "seven dirty words" monologue. 
    That wasn't erotic in the slightest. 
    It was, perhaps, in terrible taste. 
    It was more funny than erotic. 
    It might have been gross. 
    But, it had nothing to do with heavy breathing. 
    It had nothing to do with anything porno... pornographic in the usual sense. 
    The government concedes that this ban applies even if there maybe serious value. 
    Indeed, as one of the amicus briefs suggest, one of the commissioners of the FCC wondered why Ulysses, sort of, ever made it, because he doubted that it had serious value. 
    This law is about as broad as one can imagine.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I believe it replaced the prior law with the 1988 statute. 
    But I'm sure that the prior law, which was a little bit like the law of New York in Ginsberg, it outlawed targeting minors, and it created a safe harbor If the FCC's regulations were complied with. 
    I have no doubt that they would re-enact that in a minute.

    I mean, the fact is, Justice Scalia, I, at first, didn't take this as seriously as perhaps I... I should, but last year, the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine reported that stifling graphic sexual materials may now take a toll in human lives in the current period. 
    The government addresses that. 
    And they said, well, we don't know if it's true. 
    If it's protected by the First amendment, the default position, when in doubt should be, don't suppress.

    Right. 
    [Laughter] 
    Of course, the Miller case, the separate, entirely separable obscenity provision draws on Miller, which involved a mass mailing thrust on unwilling people. 
    And some members of the Court would really, I think, be understandably reluctant to uphold an obscenity law where the interests of unconsenting adults are children are otherwise taken care of. 
    But the key point about the obscenity provision is that even if you would otherwise regard the government's power of criminalization as broad enough to encompass obscene transmission to a consenting adult the government has conceded that this law, because of the discretion of the phone companies they can Invite... invite eavesdroppers from Salt Lake City on calls meant only to Los Angeles. 
    This law puts pressure on the companies to leave on the cutting room floor protected material... protected in the community where it is targeted, in order to avoid prosecution. 
    And their whole answer is, hey, you don't need to challenge it now; wait till you're prosecuted. 
    The law Is capable of valid application. 
    That's a completely non-responsive argument.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Ah, would that it were quite as true as the government suggests at page 22 of its reply brief. 
    What is correct Is that proposed tariffs are in place with the California PUC. 
    It's completely up to Pacific Bell whether to live with them. 
    And their current proposal says, we might do it, but we will not allow you to collect any revenue for these local calls. 
    Well, that's not exactly a settlement. 
    That is, they might allow carrying local calls, purely local, which they would exclude from eavesdropping from across the country, but not transmit any of the revenue generated thereby to Sable.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --but I suppose you could say of records that people sell, they could also use live singers. 
    But this is a separate, distinctive channel of communication. 
    And the government's position, that they can shrink it to what is fit for children, knows no limiting principle whatever. 
    And whatever one might think of the great or small value of this stuff, it seems to me that the First Amendment is in the balance and that it ought to prevail.

   Rebuttal of Richard G. Taranto
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="3422.356" stopTime="3520.622">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Just a couple of brief points that I think focus on the heart of... of our dispute. 
    First of all, it cannot be consistent with what this Court held in Ginsberg and reiterated in Pacifica, that the point of sale is simply irrelevant to the inquiry. 
    If congressional and state legislative-concern ended with the proposition that minors can through a variety of means, pick up copies of Playboy Magazine in their friends' houses, or what have you then the whole proposition and ruling of Ginsberg would be defeated. 
    The point of... the significance of the point of sale is that it represents, in most cases, a very reliable opportunity to make sure that minors are screened from the audience. 
    What is distinctive about the telephone mediums as was distinctive about the broadcasting mediums is that that is simply not possible. 
    One... one additional point, and that is, we think it is, at the very least, Important in focusing, then, on whether Congress did adopt the less restrictive alternative, in addition to giving deference to Congress' and the Commission's judgement about precisely what kind of access children would have, to ensure that... that we don't... that the Court does not strike down a ban on the strength o a less restrictive alternative that the Second Circuit found unconstitutional in Carlin III, and that Sable, itself, would continue to challenge as unconstitutional.
