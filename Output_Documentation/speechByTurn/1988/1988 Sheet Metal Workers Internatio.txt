    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    In an Opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that the removal of an elected Union official in retaliation for statements he made at a Union meeting in opposition to a deuced increase sought by a Union trustee violated the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosed Act 1959. 
    The Court of Appeals? judgment is, thereby, affirmed. 
    Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
