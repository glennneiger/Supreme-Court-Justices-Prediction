National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Tarkanian

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 87-1061, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Jerry Tarkanian. 
    Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="13.464" stopTime="102.959">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association's enforcement of its own standards, among its own members, is state action for Fourteenth Amendment and Section 1983 purposes. 
    In the early 1970's, the NCAA began an investigation of certain alleged practices at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, some of which involved its basketball program. 
    As is the case with all NCAA investigations, the primary responsibility for the investigation rests with the University, and both the University and the Association conducted their own investigations. 
    The Association's counsel ultimately affirmed some 38 of its Infractions Committee's findings of violations, 10 of which involved the Respondent, who had become the head coach after the time that the Association first received complaints about UNLV. 
    As part of the prescribed remedy, UNLV was directed to show cause why three persons should not be suspended from coaching and any involvement with intercollegiate athletic activities. 
    Those three persons were the former head coach, the Respondent, and an assistant coach. 
    As for the former coach, the suspension was to be permanent, and as to the other two, the suspension was to be for two years.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="102.959" stopTime="105.333">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The suspension from what, Mr. Lee?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="105.333" stopTime="114.189">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    From coaching, and from all involvement in booster activities and other intercollegiate activities. 
    It would not have affected his University appointment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="114.189" stopTime="122.139">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So the NCAA said in effect to UNLV, 
    "You must suspend so-and-so for a certain period of time? "
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="122.139" stopTime="202.512">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Not quite. 
    What it said was... it was an order to show cause why they should not do so. 
    And that is an important point, actually, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Pursuant to that order to show cause, the President of the University assigned a Vice President as hearing officer, who held a hearing and then as a result of that hearing identified for the President three options that were available to the University, and according to the Hearing Officer's recommendation, those three options were the following: 
    The first was that the university could impose the recommended discipline, which would involve the two-year suspension. 
    A second was to refuse to do so, and according to the Hearing Officer, this ran the risk that the NCAA might impose other sanctions, some of which might be more severe. 
    And the third was to withdraw from NCAA membership. 
    Faced with those choices, the University opted to impose the suspension, which has never been carried out, because of an injunction which was ultimately affirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court, whose state action holding is now before this Court for review. 
    The Respondent does not contend... nor could he... that the NCAA itself is a governmental entity. 
    Rather, his argument--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="202.512" stopTime="206.791">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Lee, did the injunction run against he NCAA, as well as against UNLV?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="206.791" stopTime="207.681">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --It ran against UNLV.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="207.681" stopTime="211.227">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then how did NCAA get in the case?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="211.227" stopTime="224.255">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Initially, they were not. 
    The case went up to the Nevada Supreme Court a first time, and the Nevada Supreme Court held that the NCAA was an indispensable party... so it was back, the NCAA was joined, and then it went up a second time.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="224.255" stopTime="229.501">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And the Nevada Court made that at the instance of the Association?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="229.501" stopTime="230.906">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Appearing as amicus, that is--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="230.906" stopTime="233.015">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Who said that they were an indispensable part.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="233.015" stopTime="241.434">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --That is correct, that is correct. 
    But we were not joined, initially. 
    We contended that we should be, and ultimately the Nevada Supreme Court agreed with us on that issue, the first time.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="241.434" stopTime="256.694">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But why did you contend that NCAA was indispensable, Mr. Lee?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="256.694" stopTime="272.578">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, because the judgment that would ultimately come out of the court would necessarily have an important effect... after all, it was our determination that that was the appropriate remedy for the violation of our rules.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="272.578" stopTime="288.869">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it's a little strange to be arguing in a way that NCAA was a necessary party to the action, and yet should not be considered in any way as State actor. 
    Is there any tension there?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="288.869" stopTime="325.777">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No, no, I think not, because of what this Court said in 1982 about what are the standards for determining state action, and they are not the same standards as for determining whether a party is indispensable. 
    And those two... there are two requirements, that this Court announced in Lugar v. Edmonson Oil. 
    The first is that you look to the substantive rule that is being enforced in the particular case and inquire into whether that rule has its source in some State authority. 
    The second is whether there is sufficient interlinking, intermeshing, between them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="325.777" stopTime="338.223">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think that Lugar was intended to be the definitive statement of how we determine state action in all cases, even those of perhaps delegation or joint participation?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="338.223" stopTime="343.331">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, of course, Justice O'Connor, you know much about... much more about what the Court had intended.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="343.331" stopTime="356.514">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you're arguing that that is now the definitive rule. 
    I'm not sure that I can read Lugar that way, and I'm not sure whether those tests should be applied in all situations of delegation.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="356.514" stopTime="400.261">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    In our argument, is that they should. 
    Maybe not or its face... it appears to say all cases, and it announced two requirements, and it said that the difference between the two requirements are demonstrated... is demonstrated by two of the Court's landmark cases. 
    Moose Lodge, which demonstrates the rule of decision, or the rule of conduct, requirement, and Flagg Brothers, which demonstrates the State actor requirement. 
    And both of those, of course, reach far beyond the context in Lugar, and far beyond the context in this case, and therefore in our view it is a general rule. 
    But you don't have to go that far... excuse me.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="400.261" stopTime="421.769">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what if NCAA said, for example, we want drug testing of all participating athletes on a regular basis, and you either do that, or you run the risk of the school being dropped out of the NCAA. 
    Now, is there any... do we have exactly the same kind of an issue that we have here?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="421.769" stopTime="483.930">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Not quite. 
    If, as I suggested, the first line of defense, Lugar applies across the board for all cases, then it would be the same. 
    But I... in any event, those two tests, and particularly the first one, ought to apply in a case such as this, and here is why. 
    Even if it is not the principled, of the two-part, across the board test in all cases that we take, at the very least, when the sole issue in the case is whether a particular rule of conduct has been violated, as it has in this case... the NCAA's standards for eligibility and recruitment... then, at the very least when that's the sole, ultimate issue in the case, then one of the relative inquiries, on a case-by-case approach... one of the most important inquiries... ought to be whether the rule of conduct in that particular case had a governmental source or a non-governmental source.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="483.930" stopTime="499.565">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, Mr. Lee, how did the rule become applicable to Mr. Tarkanian? 
    Sure, it's an NCAA rule, but it also becomes a school rule--
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="499.565" stopTime="501.782">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="501.782" stopTime="507.734">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --because they joined. 
    They're a member. 
    They say, 
    "we agree to abide by the NCAA rules. "
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="507.734" stopTime="507.937">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --That's correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="507.937" stopTime="518.230">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So this is now the rule for the institution. 
    Otherwise, how did Tarkanian... how did he get in trouble with the University? 
    He violated one of their rules.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="518.230" stopTime="537.439">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Yes. 
    The NCAA is composed in part of public universities and in part of State universities. 
    But it cannot be the rule, I submit, simply because you have some State universities and some private universities, that it thereby becomes, that it thereby becomes--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="537.439" stopTime="548.779">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, then, you don't... do you find something erroneous in what I said, that it became a University rule when the University joined and said "We agree"?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="548.779" stopTime="554.496">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --It really was not a University rule. 
    It remained--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="554.496" stopTime="561.055">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, if it wasn't, how did they have the nerve to suspend Mr. Tarkanian?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="561.055" stopTime="576.487">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --They have the nerve to suspend Mr. Tarkanian because they decided on the basis of their exercise of their own judgment that of the three options available to them, that was the one that was preferable to them. 
    It was not the NCAA that suspended Tarkanian.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="576.487" stopTime="578.862">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It certainly wasn't. 
    It was the University.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="578.862" stopTime="579.486">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="579.486" stopTime="580.580">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    For violating its rule.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="580.580" stopTime="604.101">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No, for violating... the University suspended Tarkanian not for violating its rule, but rather because it determined that, of the three options that were available to it, as a result of the order to show cause, the one that was most in the University's interest was the option to impose the recommended, the recommended suspension.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="604.101" stopTime="618.345">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even if they did... even if the University suspended him for violating a University rule, that might make the University a State actor, but I don't know why that makes NCAA a State actor. 
    What relief does the Nevada court grant against the NCAA?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="618.345" stopTime="623.045">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    The relief was against the University and not against the NCAA.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="623.045" stopTime="632.106">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what business has the NCAA got here? 
    Well, there's an injunction against the NCAA for taking any action against the University.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="632.106" stopTime="632.651">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="632.651" stopTime="634.993">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then, there was relief granted.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="634.993" stopTime="637.493">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, excuse me, in that sense there was. 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="637.493" stopTime="641.851">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The NCAA is prohibited from taking any action against UNLV.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="649.847" stopTime="670.433">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Lee, I'm a little confused about what was the basis for the firing here. 
    It seems to me if the man has an employment contract with the University, the University can't say we're firing you for breaking somebody else's rules. 
    He must have violated some rule that was imposed by virtue of his employment with the University?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="670.433" stopTime="679.351">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --The rules that he violated were the NCAA's rules of eligibility and recruitment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="679.351" stopTime="684.928">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, how did they become applicable to him? 
    I assume they became applicable to him through his employment contract with the University.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="684.928" stopTime="704.686">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    They became applicable to him only because the NCAA prescribed 
    "We have determined that these violations have occurred. " 
    And the University was ordered to show cause why as a result of those violations he should not be suspended. 
    But it was the University--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="704.686" stopTime="710.918">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But he must have had an obligation to someone not to commit those violations. 
    To whom did he have that obligation?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="710.918" stopTime="790.416">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --Yes, he had an obligation to his University, in the sense that the University was jointly responsible with the NCAA for seeing to it that they did agree that they would enforce those rules. 
    But my point is this: that if you take seriously what this Court said in Lugar, about looking to the source of the substantive rules, this is the classic case in which, in which that requirement applies. 
    If you look to all of the factors that might enter into whether there is or is not state action, the only issue in this case, at the end of the day, the only substantive issue, is whether the rules, some rules have been violated. 
    Those rules are the eligibility rules that have been set by the University, that have been set by the NCAA, and which have become the University's rules only in the sense that the University is one of those members. 
    But the University did not have to dismiss him. 
    There were other options that were available to them... and particularly, particularly in a case where the only issue, the only substantive issue, is the issue whether or not particular rules have been violated, then the source of those rules ought to be relevant to the state action issue.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Excuse me?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="792.431" stopTime="794.508">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The University decided to suspend him.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="794.508" stopTime="796.008">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct, but that was--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="796.008" stopTime="801.241">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And they decided, well, this is one or our rules, that we're going to insist he abide by.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="801.241" stopTime="882.676">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --This case in that respect, Justice White, really follows a fortiori from this Court's holding in Blum v. Yaretsky. 
    In that instance, what you had was a decision to transfer patients from a lesser-care facility... excuse me, from a higher-care facility to a lesser-care facility. 
    And the decision was made... the rule of conduct, or the rule of decision in that particular instance, if you will, was made by private individuals. 
    But once those private individuals, the doctors, made that decision, it had an effect on important Governmental interests. 
    The Governmental decision as to how to treat these individuals, the Medicaid program is a Governmental program, but the relevant decisions were in effect made by the private entities... including the amount of money that would be spent by Government. 
    Nevertheless, what this Court said was that all the Government had done was to respond to those private decisions, and that is exactly what we have in this instance. 
    You have the NCAA having set its rules, and its members then responding to the termination of those rules violations, and that we submit, under Blum v. Yaretsky and under Lugar, is not state action.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="882.676" stopTime="924.722">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You have a State arbitrator who says that there are three choices, but that the only viable choice is to allow the University's delegation to the NCAA of the power to act as ultimate arbiter of these matters. 
    And the President of the University adopts that determination. 
    These are State officials who announce that the NCAA must be the ultimate arbitrator. 
    Do we not give some deference to that conclusion by the State officials as a matter of State law?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="924.722" stopTime="959.726">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    As a matter of State law, of course you give deference to them, Justice Kennedy. 
    But the issue here is whether the state action rules, which are of course constitutional determinations, and interpretations of Section 1983 by this Court... and what the State did in that instance was simply to determine, yes, we became members of the NCAA. 
    When we become members of the NCAA, we determine that we will abide by their rules. 
    But they also identified that they had other options.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="959.726" stopTime="966.051">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Were their conclusions correct? 
    Was the arbitrator correct in what he identified as alternative two?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="966.051" stopTime="978.516">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Yes, I think he was... yes, he was. 
    Alternative two was that they could have said no, and they could have... then other sanctions would have had to be--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="978.516" stopTime="984.045">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    He was correct that the University's only real option was to recognize NCAA as the ultimate arbiter?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="984.045" stopTime="1040.085">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --Well, I don't know that he identified that as the only real option. 
    It was his recommended option. 
    But the... I think this point should be made very clear: UNLV did not have to fire Tarkanian. 
    That was their decision, their option, and they made it from a choice of those three. 
    Moreover, this first requirement that the Court established in Lugar, in any event, is absent in this case, and regardless of how far it extends, it should be applicable in a case, in a case such as this. 
    I think that key to decision is to draw a careful decision... excuse me, draw a careful distinction between what the NCAA did on the one hand, and what UNLV did on the other hand.

    Well, we believe that is basically what happened in Moose Lodge, and that this Court would have the authority to do that.

    And at that point, there will still be three options available to the University of Nevada, except that the third one will have changed. 
    And the third one will be to go back to the Nevada State Supreme Court, to go back to the Nevada court, and attempt to persuade them that the injunction should be dissolved because it was based on a premise which the United States Supreme Court has now declared to be faulty.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, I would hope that $200,000 does. 
    And I would think that the fee certainly does. 
    But in addition, more importantly--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1254.795" stopTime="1261.746">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But on the fee point, Mr. Lee, isn't it true that the only justification for the fees was the 1983 action, which in turn depends on the state action?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1261.746" stopTime="1262.340">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --Yes, and that's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1262.340" stopTime="1264.386">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And that's why no matter what we do, we have to decide that.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1264.386" stopTime="1424.117">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --And that, of course, is more important, is even more important than the fees itself, because you do have, you do have an outstanding determination by a State supreme court that this area of individual freedom, which is guaranteed by the limitation of the state action doctrine, as the Court said in Lugar, has been withdrawn from the NCAA, and its ability to conduct its investigations in the way that it sees as in its best interests has been severely curtailed. 
    Let me just say that there are, in addition to the legal reasons that neither one of the Lugar tests, neither the rule of conduct issue nor the joint participation issue has been satisfied in this case. 
    There are good reasons why the state action rules should not apply to the NCAA's enforcement of its own rules among its own members. 
    This Court said four years ago that the NCAA plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports, and there can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role. 
    This is the classic case that illustrates both that critical role and why it needs ample latitude in order to carry it out. 
    The procedures that it follows place principal responsibility, or divide the responsibility for enforcement, as between the two. 
    It is not a strictly adversarial kind of procedure. 
    What the NCAA has concluded over the years is that it can best be done by a combination of cooperation and adversarialness. 
    And the accomplishment... that ample latitude that this Court observed that the Association needs to carry out its critical role... will be aided by leaving this area of associational freedom continually available to the NCAA so that it can make its own judgments as to how best to carry it out. 
    The key to decision, I submit, to this case, is to distinguish rather carefully between what the NCAA does on the one hand and what the University did on the other. 
    What the NCAA did was to set its own standards for conduct. 
    Because they were the NCAA's standards and not the University's standards, the first of the Lugar requirements has not been satisfied.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1424.117" stopTime="1429.818">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But didn't the University make those standards its own by contract?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1429.818" stopTime="1524.764">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, I think not, and I think that to say that, to characterize it in that way, Justice O'Connor, really does violate the spirit of what I think to be not only Lugar, but also this Court's more recent pronouncement in the area, which is West v. Atkins, in which those two requirements were repeated. 
    As the Lugar opinion says, they really aren't the same. 
    They are two separate requirements. 
    And especially in a case where the only substantive issue at the end of the day is whether rules have been violated, you ought to ask, 
    "where do those rules come from? " 
    Those are not UNLV's rules, they are the NCAA's rules. 
    They are UNLV's rules only in the sense that UNLV is a member of the Association. 
    But the Association itself is a private entity, and they are, the Association is, the source of the rules. 
    What the University did was, what the NCAA did not do, was to make the decision, was to suspend Tarkanian. 
    All the the NCAA did in this respect was to determine that its standards of conduct had been violated, that its conditions of membership had been violated, and then it was the University that exercised its choice among three options available to it. 
    For two independent reasons, therefore, we submit that the judgment of the Nevada court should be reversed. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Samuel S. Lionel
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1528.029" stopTime="1590.893">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'm looking at page three of our brief here, and I'm reading from the NCAA enforcement program. 
    Among other things, it says, 
    "The enforcement procedures are an essential part of the intercollegiate athletic program of each member institution. " 
    Thus, when the University became a member of the Association, its enforcement procedures became a part of its athletic program. 
    Not only that, by becoming a member, the University agreed to abide by the Constitution, the bylaws, the rules, the interpretations of those rules, and the policies of the NCAA.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1590.893" stopTime="1601.311">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    There is a question that there was state action in the case in the sense that the University is a state actor, and it did the suspending. 
    But why is the NCAA a state actor? 
    That's the question.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1601.311" stopTime="1623.224">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    The NCAA is a state actor because the University delegated to the Association the right to make the disciplinary standards and determinations and have a rule of conduct, as it did here... and that comes clearly under the Lugar, the delegation... there's delegation under the first prong, Mr. Justice.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1623.224" stopTime="1626.067">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So this is a sort of a joint action case?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1626.067" stopTime="1627.597">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Absolute, in our view, yes.

    Do you say the University delegated to the NCAA, or the NCAA delegated to the University? 
    Which?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1634.361" stopTime="1660.116">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    No, the University delegated to the NCAA the right to set the standards, disciplinary standards, with respect to State employees involved in the athletic program, and to make determinations as to whether there were violations of those standards, and to impose penalties against State employees for their claimed violations of these standards.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1660.116" stopTime="1667.159">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1667.159" stopTime="1715.093">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Yes, it did, and that is exactly what happened here, because the NCAA said that Coach Tarkanian would be, should be suspended for two years, and the Hearing Officer, who held a hearing under the procedures contained, under the NCAA enforcement procedures adopted, said that this is what you are, we are contractually compelled, to carry out that sanction and recommended to the President of the University that it be done. 
    And the President of the University within two days wrote to Mr. Tarkanian and said, 
    "We have... I have no alternative, we must... are contractually bound to follow the penalties of the NCAA, adjudged by the NCAA, and you are therefore suspended for two years. "
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1715.093" stopTime="1722.496">

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    --But as the record indicates, the NCAA is the only game in town.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, that's actually what happened in this instance here, but that is the only game in town. 
    And as a matter of fact, what happened here, is initially Coach Tarkanian sued only the University, and obtained an injunction. 
    The University was requested by the NCAA to appeal that, which it did, and then the NCAA filed an amicus brief taking the position that it was an indispensable party because the injunction against the University impaired the right of the NCAA to enforce the penalties which it had judged under its program. 
    In that amicus brief, it said the following: that the University was bound by contract to abide by the NCAA penalties.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1823.629" stopTime="1842.699">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Even if it wasn't bound, even if it could just have said, 
    "Sorry, we're not going to suspend Mr. Tarkanian. " 
    Even if contractually they could have done it, they didn't. 
    They said, they did just the reverse. 
    They said, 
    "We will abide by that rule. "
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1842.699" stopTime="1861.284">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Yes, they did. 
    And in any, almost every state action, there is an option on the part of the state actor and on the part of the State. 
    When the state fires somebody, and there may be a constitutional violation involved... the 1983 case... they could not have fired that person. 
    There is always an option.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1861.284" stopTime="1898.942">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the record looks like the University basically agreed with Mr. Tarkanian here, and did not want to fire him, and didn't agree with the NCAA's assessment of the facts, and chose not to appeal the State court decision that said the University couldn't fire... couldn't suspend him. 
    And it looked very much like the University is not acting jointly, in a sense, in that sense, with the NCAA. 
    It basically took Mr. Tarkanian's view of the thing.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1898.942" stopTime="1971.069">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    I submit that that, Justice O'Connor, is not really what happened here. 
    Under the rules, the University was supposed to cooperate when charges were filed... and they did. 
    They investigated it as they were required and filed everything that was filed, participated in the hearing. 
    There was nothing in the rules that say that the University must lay down and agree with everything the NCAA did. 
    They filed charges, and they admitted some of those charges, and in some cases they did not admit those charges. 
    And the Committee on Infractions made a determination, and then they said that Coach Tarkanian, the University should suspend Tarkanian for two years. 
    And when it came back, the hearing Officer said that the basis for those findings and the sanctions appeared to be clearly in doubt, and the due process that was followed was somewhat suspect, but we are contractually compelled, and therefore you should do it, Mr. President. 
    Mr. President said, 
    "We have no alternative. " 
    "We will do it. " 
    "We will say that there was joint participation at all times. " 
    It is true that the University did not agree with what happened.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    It would seem to me that one could very well say that the Association should not be committed at this time to say that we claim that we were indispensable, this case has gone on for years only because the Court agreed that we had rights to protect at that time. 
    Now we're saying we should not be a party. 
    I think, arguably, it could be estopped from taking that position. 
    We have been troubled by that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2062.110" stopTime="2112.762">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I thought that's what you were saying all along-- 
    --Mr. Lionel, in looking at our cases... although they're not all easy to reconcile... there does appear to be one common theme. 
    And that is, is that the entity in question must be held to be a state actor, or there is no relief... Mrs. Marsh and the company town, the Eagle coffee shop, the Lugar case. 
    Here, the State remains a party, it remains responsible. 
    It remained obligated to Tarkanian, not to discharge him. 
    Why is it necessary for the NCAA to be in the suit for any meaningful relief to be given to your client?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2112.762" stopTime="2155.307">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    If the NCAA is not enjoined from proceeding against the University, and to take steps which might ultimately throw the University out of the NCAA, the victory of Mr. Tarkanian is a hollow one, because there will be no basketball program anymore. 
    He will have nothing to coach. 
    He will not be able to get a job coaching college athletics because of what has happened in this particular case. 
    The rules say that before any University hires someone as a coach, they should check to see what his history may have been with respect to any claimed violations against the NCAA. 
    And I submit under those--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2155.307" stopTime="2186.732">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, did he claim a reputational interest in this case? 
    His argument is that he wants to keep his job, and he won that argument. 
    His argument is he wants to keep his position, and he won that argument. 
    The University is there, it's a responsible entity. 
    It's subject to the jurisdiction of the Court for all of the relief that he sought. 
    And so it seems to me that under our cases, there's no necessity for finding the NCAA to be a state actor.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    --Well, what happened was, we amended the complaint after the reversal and remand, so the NCAA could then become a party. 
    We amended it, and stated a 1983 claim against the NCAA. 
    So this present complaint is against both the University and the NCAA, stating claims under 1983, and the courts below found... the trial court found that there was a 1983 case against both. 
    Only the NCAA did appeal to the State court, and is here. 
    But there clearly is a claim, and our position is that there is such a claim... that the NCAA is a joint participant, that the NCAA under West v. Atkins was delegated these disciplinary rights over a State employee... and we say we are a stronger case than West v. Atkins. 
    In West v. Atkins, you find a delegation, and you find a deferral by the State. 
    In this case, there is a delegation. 
    There is a deferral by the State, and then the State afforded the NCAA significant assistance in saying to Tarkanian, "You are now suspended".

    With respect to the Lugar case, we think we fall clearly under Lugar. 
    The first prong of Lugar indicates two different types of situations, one where there is a delegation... and here there is that delegation to the NCAA, of the right to make those disciplinary standards and determination... and number two, that if there is, if the State imposes a rule of conduct... now, the rule of conduct here is the NCAA saying that Jerry Tarkanian did this, which he shouldn't, and there should be a two-year suspension. 
    And the University imposed that. 
    That clearly comes under Lugar, and there can be no doubt that insofar as the Association is concerned, its conduct is attributable to the State.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let me ask you a question. 
    Let's assume that we agree with you, that the NCAA is a state actor insofar as Mr. Tarkanian is concerned, that he has a remedy against the University. 
    But what... even if that's the case, what was the basis for the injunction against the NCAA from taking action against the University itself?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2833.661" stopTime="2843.892">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Because if it were permitted to take action against the University, the injunction that Coach Tarkarian received will not help him any.

    Why?

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    --Against both. 
    When we amended the complaint, after the remand, to make it so the NCAA could become a party, we amended it and also stated a claim under 1983 against the Association.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2875.894" stopTime="2887.312">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't see what the basis... even if you win on a state action thing, what's the basis for telling the NCAA that it can't suspend the University, if the University wants to keep Mr. Tarkanian on, that's fine. 
    But it's not going to be a member.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but the NCAA shouldn't be required to keep a member on that isn't living up to its rules.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2935.777" stopTime="2942.385">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    --The only rule that would be involved here would be the non-suspension of Coach Tarkanian.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2942.385" stopTime="2957.019">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The Constitution forbids the University from firing Coach Tarkanian without proper process, but surely the Constitution doesn't require that the University give him a major-league basketball team to coach, does it?

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    No, it doesn't.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2958.330" stopTime="2969.139">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So then what is the... maybe the Chief Justice is right, that all he is entitled to under the Constitution is a Pyrrhic victory, that he can coach whatever basketball team the University has?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2969.139" stopTime="3002.969">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, it would seem to me that a court of equity could do what the court below did here. 
    The court said, 
    "He has a right to have vindicated his constitutional rights. " 
    He is not vindicated but if we are going to say he can't continue to do what he did before, in which the court found he had a property right. 
    In effect, if there is no injunction against the NCAA, he will have lost that property right to be that basketball coach--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3002.969" stopTime="3014.355">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Property right, not just to have a job with the University, not just to coach the University's basketball team, but a property right to coach an NCAA basketball team... that's what the Constitution guarantees him?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="3014.355" stopTime="3031.582">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    --Yes, and also, there were other rights that flowed from that, as we pointed out. 
    He lost... he had clinics, he had other matters, and radio programs, all of which came from the fact that he was the basketball coach at the University.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3031.582" stopTime="3063.569">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, but your position, as I understand it, is that if the NCAA is a state actor, it has to follow constitutional procedures when it imposes sanctions on anybody. 
    And you would really require them to remodel their whole procedural mechanisms for dealing with this kind of case and maybe... you know, if you're right, it seems to me that they would have an obligation to follow due process procedures, and not use private investigators, to rely on hearsay and that sort of thing. 
    So what really is at stake is what kind of procedures they can use when the member that's being challenged is a public entity rather than a private one.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="3063.569" stopTime="3077.017">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That's correct. 
    And in fact, as a result of this case, as the result of a Congressional oversight committee investigation which followed shortly thereafter, the NCAA has changed many of their rules with respect to this type of investigation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3077.017" stopTime="3098.602">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I think then that even if you win, as Justice Stevens suggests, if the NCAA wanted to take some action against a State university, even though no employee was involved, it would have to follow due process procedures.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="3098.602" stopTime="3109.254">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if the University's become a member of this association, and it delegated... it makes this big delegation, and so... and the NCAA has some rules that it must comport with due process?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, if it is, what is the basis here for an injunction against the NCAA from moving against the University?

    In answer to Justice White's question, the obligation that the UNLV is under tort appears on page 80 of the joint appendix. 
    And what it is, of course, is an agreement to, it's on fundamental policy 2(b), 
    "shall be obligated to apply and enforce this legislation and the enforcement program of the Association shall be applied to an institution when it fails to fulfill this obligation. " 
    What the UNLV agreed to do was to abide by the NCAA's rules. 
    What it did not agree to do, and could not have agreed to do, as a governmental entity, was to delegate any kind of discipline of State employees or any other Governmental function to the NCAA. 
    And the way it's tested is this: assume that what President Bepler had said, back in 1977, was 
    "No, our answer to the order to show cause is we cannot and will not, because under our judgment, he just doesn't deserve to be suspended, and that is a function that is non-delegable as a matter of Nevada State law. " 
    What the NCAA would have done at that point is to look to other sanctions. 
    They would not have, and could not have required that he be dismissed.

    So you say it looks like the university is looking around for a set of rules to have in its university, and it suddenly runs across the NCAA which has promulgated a bunch of rules that it recommends for universities to adopt, and so the university says, gee, here's a bunch of rules, we'll just adopt them.

    Well, they just simply agreed to adopt this set of rules?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3345.268" stopTime="3368.758">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --That is correct. 
    As a condition of membership... and in the event that they decide not to follow those rules, or not to follow the NCAA procedures, they can either accept... it wasn't just a matter of NCAA membership, though if it were, the legal rule would still have been the same. 
    They could have accepted other, less severe sanctions, such as an extended period of probation, pure scholarships, etcetera.

    Let's assume they're wrong on the state action, that Tarkanian was entitled to a remedy here. 
    What was the basis for the injunction against the NCAA's taking action against the University?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3386.095" stopTime="3411.974">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Because the State court judge said that UNLV had acted wrongfully, and there was a derivative, there was a derivative right from the NCAA. 
    I do not defend that... I do not think that's right... but that was the basis for the injunction. 
    And I want to stress that the only relief we're asking for is the relief of, of the release of the injunction against the NCAA.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3411.974" stopTime="3419.941">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And do you argue that even if it's held to be a state actor, that injunction shouldn't stand? 
    I don't know--
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3419.941" stopTime="3420.300">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No, no, no.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3420.300" stopTime="3421.362">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --I've never heard you say that.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3421.362" stopTime="3423.440">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No, no, no. 
    I'm not saying that even if we're held--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3423.440" stopTime="3433.389">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But that's the argument. 
    That's the question that I asked you. 
    Even if you lose on state action, why should you be forbidden to take action against the University?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3433.389" stopTime="3492.349">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --I see. 
    I think there are good reasons why we shouldn't, but we also think we are not a state actor, for reasons that have been stated. 
    What this whole argument this morning has demonstrated is the mischief that you get into once you open the door beyond those two Lugar requirements. 
    There are good reasons for those two Lugar requirements, and also for the rule in Blum v. Yaretsky. 
    All that happened here was a response by a governmental entity to a non-governmental entity. 
    Blum v. Yaretsky says that that is not sufficient. 
    And once you open that door, you get into problems like the United Airlines hypothetical, and like the numerous others that are raised in our brief. 
    There are lots of accrediting agencies, for example, that set standards, private entities, that set standards for Governmental entities to abide by. 
    Are they bound by the full panoply of Fourteenth Amendment and 1983 restrictions on their area of private activity, and also subject to damage actions? 
    We would hope not.
