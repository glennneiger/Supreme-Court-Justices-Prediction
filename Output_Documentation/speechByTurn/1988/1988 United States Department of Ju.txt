    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-782, United States Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts. 
    Mr. Wallace?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This Freedom of Information Act case reflects the not unique circumstance that the Federal Government is a party to all federal tax litigation, as it is to a number of other categories of litigation, such as Federal Tort Claims Act cases, government contracts, mall fraud prosecutions, FOIA cases, and others that might occur. 
    Since 1972, the Respondent has published a weekly report of developments in federal taxation for which it charges its subscribers an annual fee of $595. 
    And since 1979, the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, pursuant to FOIA, has provided to Respondent and other commercial tax services weekly logs of court decisions of which the Department has been informed in federal tax cases. 
    This controversy arises out of 26 weekly requests that Respondent made beginning in November of 1984 for the United States district court opinions, orders and decisions in tax cases identified in the log released during the previous week. 
    It apparently occurred to Respondent that the Department of Justice, which receives these orders and decisions as a litigator, might be a either more reliable, or at least more convenient, source of these decisions than the courts issuing them and perhaps part of the convenience would be a less expensive source, since the rather elaborate fee provisions under FOIA are designed in large part to keep the costs down in order to facilitate access to information about what the government is doing. 
    This type of request, whatever its convenience to the requester, is quite inconvenient and burdensome to the government as a litigator. 
    These opinions and orders are not collected in any one place for the government's convenience. 
    They come in in a mass of paper flow and by various routes, and the managerial problem is to get them routed with reasonable promptness to the lawyer assigned or the lawyer now assigned to the case, since there is considerable turnover in the government, so that the government can perform its responsibilities as a litigator in the cases, decide whether to take an appeal if the case has been lost, proceed to enforce the judgment, what have you. 
    These are not used by the Department as a research tool. 
    They are used for purposes of conducting the litigation. 
    So--

    Mr. Wallace, as far as the inconvenience is concerned, though, the Respondents suggest that maybe that's the way you do it now, but it would be no great inconvenience to simply instruct each attorney in the field that when the court opinion is issued and he forwards a copy to wherever he now forwards it, another copy also be sent to some central repository where you would have all of them.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --By and large, these are received by clerical personnel... and they come in in the mall in the Department... whose job it is to identify the proper unit, the proper litigating unit, in the Tax Division, to whom to send the opinions. 
    The attorneys receive them in two or three days time typically. 
    It takes a while to distribute them. 
    If there were routine duplication, which does not occur now, at the clerical level, further delay would be added inevitably. 
    There are backups for these machines. 
    They break down, et cetera. 
    The lawyers are not always present. 
    They do not routinely reproduce these items. 
    There is no repository where they're kept. 
    They're not used, for example, by the bulk of lawyers in the Tax Division itself as a research source. 
    Unless the lawyer happens to be the lawyer on the case or a close colleague who knows of it, they are much more apt to use the loose-leaf services in the library--

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    The record shows that there are 20,000 tax cases per year, but it does not break that down into district court and other cases, nor does it show how many district court cases might result in numerous orders being issued.

    There are several loose-leaf services that publish federal tax decisions.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, let me, as a preface to answering the question, say we do not think that this case requires the Court to adopt an all-encompassing definition that will cover every kind of case. 
    We start off with the notion that agency records include records generated by the agency which reflect the public business or compiled by the agency in a way that is revealing about how the agency is conducting its public business. 
    But it does not include, for example, library materials that are held by the agency even though those are used in conducting the public business and purchase pursuant to appropriations of funds. 
    We do not think that reproducing those materials, becoming a library referral service, is within the purpose of FOIA. 
    And we do not think that records issued by the courts' decisions or orders or materials issued by the Congress are part of agency records, as we would urge the Court to interpret it under FOIA. 
    FOIA does not define agency records. 
    It does define the agencies that are covered by FOIA, and that definition excludes the courts and Congress which traditionally have controlled the issuance and dissemination of their own opinions and orders. 
    We collect--

    No. 
    That's why I... I... I do think we have to be cautious about an all-encompassing definition. 
    The... the particular reason why we concluded that pre-sentence reports should be treated as agency records is that they were compiled, as the Ninth Circuit said, substantially for use by the Department of Justice. 
    They were furnished to the Bureau of Prisons where, under Department of Justice regulations, they are used in the conduct of public business in making work assignments for the prisoners, counseling them, treating them, in making decisions about security that's needed for particular prisoners, and they are used in making parole decisions.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    There is an analogy there, but it is... it is used only as a... the way any litigator would use the opinion or the way any lawyer would, to the extent it's used as a statement of what the law is for guidance in other cases, the same as a reported case in the Department of Justice's law library. 
    Obviously, the orders are issued for compliance by the parties to the case. 
    But that is a... a routine litigation use that in no way is different for the Department as a litigator than for any other litigator. 
    It's not part of the conduct of public business in the same way that administering the prisons would be. 
    There's an analogy there, but there's also an analogy to the other reported decisions in the library. 
    The... the case falls in between. 
    What seems to us important is that... and we developed historical materials on this on pages two and three of our reply memorandum at the petition stage... traditionally the courts have controlled the dissemination of their own opinions and orders. 
    Clerks' offices exist for the very purpose of receiving filings and disseminating court opinions and orders. 
    And the court exercises control over that. 
    And that is not the function of the Department of Justice. 
    If there is a problem with the dissemination of opinions and orders by the clerks of the courts, FOIA was not intended to solve that, and doesn't... it isn't designed to solve that. 
    The fit is not good. 
    There are too many cases in which the Department of Justice or the Federal Government is not a party at all. 
    It... it can't really solve that problem to turn from the clerks' offices to the Department of Justice in the cases where the government happens to be a party. 
    And there's no reason to think that FOIA was designed to transfer that burden or that function from the clerks' offices to one of the litigators that happens to be the government.

    It might be subject to a work product or other privilege. 
    There might be an exemption. 
    Unlike the typical FOIA case, which involves a question of what will be disclosed to the general public and what will be held confidential to some degree, this case involves publicly available documents that are available at their issuing source.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    I can't say that I've consulted on that, that... that the face of the statute answers that particular problem. 
    There was a Ninth Circuit decision called Warth against the Department of Justice, which we have mentioned, involving trial transcripts which court reporters do sell for a fee. 
    And the court held that these were not agency records. 
    They're court records. 
    Obviously the fee could be evaded if people could get them from the Department of... of Justice. 
    Those are... are available for a fee, but not published. 
    And we do think that these provisions on the face of the Act, excluding the obligation to produce in response to a FOIA request if the Department at least has published the materials or made them available in a reading room, have significance for this case because if it's not improper to withhold materials in that circumstance, why should it be improper to withhold court-generated materials that are similarly available at their issuing source?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --The Court held in GTE Sylvania, where no exemption was applicable, that it was not an improper withholding. 
    There there was an injunction against the dissemination of the material in a separate proceeding. 
    But the Court did rely on that term of the statute in upholding the refusal to comply with the FOIA requests in the face of the injunction. 
    So, it seems to me the Court has crossed that bridge, and it is not necessary to adopt a very expansive view of improper withholding here. 
    We are talking about court-issued opinions and orders available to the public in the normal way from the issuing source which is itself exempted from FOIA. 
    We have directed the requester to where the materials are publicly available from their normal source by furnishing copies of the logs. 
    So, in a sense there... there isn't withholding at all, let alone an improper withholding. 
    And--

    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    May I first answer the Chief Justice's question as to how many orders and decisions are at issue here? 
    First of all, of course, we are only seeking final orders and decisions which conclude the case in the district court. 
    We have not asked for interim orders like discovery orders. 
    As reported by the Judicial Conference of the United States, over the last five fiscal years, the average number of orders and decisions terminating tax cases in the federal district courts is 1,862.

    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    I'd like to put this case in context. 
    Let's suppose that Emily Taxpayer who lives in Montana has had a deficiency assessed against her, has paid it, and decides to file suit in the federal U.S. District Court for the District of Montana. 
    Her attorney prepares and files a complaint in the court, obtains a summons from the court, and those, the complaint and summons, are then served on the Attorney General of the United States, and eventually wend their way down to the office of a... of an attorney in the Tax Division. 
    We... let's call him Bill Barrister. 
    Now, Mr. Barrister immediately takes those documents and opens an official Department of Justice file with them. 
    It's called the DJ file. 
    He reads the complaint, of course, sends a copy to his counterpart in the Chief Counsel's Office of the Internal Revenue Service, and after consultation prepares an answer, which he sends to Montana. 
    It is filed in the court, and his copy of the answer is placed in the DJ file. 
    Let us suppose that both parties then file cross motions for summary judgment. 
    Ms. Taxpayer's attorney serves his on the... on Mr. Barrister and files it in court. 
    Mr. Barrister does the same thing. 
    And then finally, the judge issues his decision which is filed in the court and sent to both Taxpayer's attorney and to Barrister, again placed in the DJ file. 
    I discern no distinction, either theoretical or practical, among those documents. 
    All are filed in court, all theoretically available from the clerk, and all are agency records of the Department of Justice by all of the tests which this Court has... has--

    Take, for example, the list is obtained by my client. 
    Courts are telephoned. 
    The clerk says we have the decision or he says, well, I'll have to find the decision. 
    Sometimes a second telephone call has to be made. 
    The clerk tells you how many pages the... has to find the decision, tell you how many pages it has so you can write the check at 50 cents a page. 
    You write the check. 
    You mail it to the clerk with a letter asking for a copy of the decision. 
    Sometimes the letter is delayed in the mail. 
    Sometimes the clerk gets the letter and sticks it in his file because he's busy with other things. 
    Sometimes the checks don't get cashed, and sometimes the decisions simply don't arrive. 
    In any event, it usually takes a minimum of three to four weeks before any publisher has obtained the decision which the Department of Justice has virtually immediately.

    "It is normally the function of the trial attorney to see to it that copies of decisions are sent to the appropriate district or regional office of the Internal Revenue Service. " 
    That is the point at which, without any particular extra work or without spending more than I suppose the extra three or four seconds to run the xerox machine one more time, the extra copy could be made and could be then sent in the normal interoffice mail of the Department of Justice to the Department of Justice's press room where all publishers have access, or to the Freedom of Information Act reference room which is maintained by the Department of Justice which the public can have access to.

speaker="william_a_dobrovir" startTime="1879.453" stopTime="2001.430">
    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    Well, there are two answers to that. 
    First the practical answer. 
    Every publisher has it's own tray in the Department of Justice press room. 
    Dropping a decision into the tray of McGraw-Hill or the tray of Tax Analysts or the tray of Commerce Clearing House in... where it would sit with all the press... the many press releases and other things that the Department of Justice issues which it wishes the press to take and publish, would I submit involve virtually no additional expense. 
    The other answer is found in the legislative history. 
    In 1981 the Department of Justice began an effort to relieve... the executive branch represented by the Department of Justice began an effort to relieve itself of many of the costs which it argued were making administration of the Freedom of Information Act prohibitive. 
    A number of provisions were proposed in... in bills that were... some were... one was introduced by Senator Hatch on his own. 
    Another was introduced by Senator Hatch at the request of the Department of Justice, and that was S. 1751 in the 97th Congress. 
    That bill expressly referred to court records as among the records, public records, that the agencies did not wish any... any longer to be required to produce under the Freedom of Information Act. 
    Congress considered that. 
    The 98th Congress held hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a report in which it stated that the bill it was reporting did not include the specific relief requested by the executive branch, that is, a complete absolution from having to produce public documents, including expressly, explicitly court records because, the Senate Judiciary Committee said, court records and other things such as press clippings are not easily accessible except through the government agencies.

    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    Let me turn to the agency records issue. 
    This Court has had to deal with that question with respect to three kinds of documents: pre-sentence reports in the case of U.S. v. Crooker and U.S. v. Julian; consultants' records that the agency never got, as in Forsham; and White House records that were stored at the agency, but which were never controlled or used by the agency in pertinent part here, and that was the Kissinger case. 
    The Court has looked to five characteristics in those cases to determine what... whether the documents were agency records. 
    First of all, does the agency possess them? 
    Secondly, does the agency freely control them, or does some other entity exert control over the papers that the agency has? 
    Third, does the agency use the papers in the course of its public business? 
    Fourth, does the agency incorporate the papers in its own files? 
    And fifth, do the papers include information about the agency's operations? 
    And I suggest that if any... all five of those questions are asked with respect to court records here, the answer is yes. 
    Obviously, the Department of Justice Tax Division possesses them. 
    Obviously, it controls its copies. 
    It sends copies to the Internal Revenue Service. 
    It sends copies all around the Department of Justice. 
    When an... if an appeal is to be... is to be considered, copies go up to the Solicitor General's Office in the Department of Justice.

    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    --The point is they are not promptly published or completely published and offered for sale. 
    As I said, 25 percent of them are missed by everybody, and a lot of them are obtained only after considerable delay. 
    So, I would suggest that under those standards... under... under those tests, these documents are not promptly published and offered for sale. 
    If the Department of Justice were to pick a chosen instrument, for example, and say, okay, we are going to give you, publisher X, a copy of every one of these decisions and you can promptly offer them and publish them for sale... publish them and offer them for sale, and then we're off the hook, that would satisfy that provision of the statute. 
    The Department has not done so.

    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    Going back through my list of five questions, if I may, both the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service use these documents in their business. 
    As the agent... as the... as the... as the Petitioner's brief admits, 
    "It tells the agency how they may act. " 
    Nothing could be more involved than the agency's business than an order from the court that tells it how it may act. 
    Fourth, the Department of Justice incorporates the decisions into its permanent files, the DJ file, which is then in turn subject to elaborate record keeping, retrieval and, disposal regulations; a regulation that's in the record covers some 160 pages. 
    And finally, it provides information for the public about agency operations. 
    Every one of these decisions will at least reflect what the agency... what... what the decision is. 
    It will reflect what the agency has done. 
    Well, you don't... that isn't why... really why you want the records... the opinions, though.

    I think you have to look at each one... each kind of document on its... on its own facts. 
    Mere library books... well, for example, I guess the... the easiest example for something that isn't an agency record is if the agency library has a copy of "War and Peace", which agency lawyers may read in their leisure time.

    Well, what would be the basis in the statute for accepting that distinction?
speaker="william_a_dobrovir" startTime="3139.943" stopTime="3226.242">
    Mr. William A. Dobrovir 
    There isn't any basis in the statute because the statute doesn't define agency record. 
    This Court has to define agency record. 
    And I think it can define it in the way that Justice Scalia... Justice Scalia mentioned. 
    Let me quickly talk about the GTE v. Sylvania case and improperly withheld. 
    Our position is that except with... with the very narrow exception of documents that the agency cannot produce either because there is a court order or, for example, because it has been destroyed, improperly withheld means any withholding that is not countenanced by one of the nine exemptions. 
    GTE Sylvania talks about the fact that the agency has no discretion... had no discretion in the matter. 
    It was not the agency's decision to withhold. 
    In effect, the... the... the question of withholding or not had been taken out of the agency's hands entirely by the federal district court in Delaware. 
    That is, therefore... and as this Court said, the concerns... the concerns Congress had in passing the Freedom of Information Act, to wit, to... to curb unbridled agency discretion, were not present in GTE Sylvania because the agency had no discretion to exercise at all. 
    A similar case would be if, unfortunately, documents that were agency records happened to have been burned up in a fire. 
    There is no discretion. 
    The agency can't withhold or not withhold. 
    It's physically impossible. 
    And--

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3265.482" stopTime="3400.437">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Yes. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We have to be concerned here not merely with publishers' requests, but with requests of law firms, academic researchers. 
    Some of the law firms may be Tax Analysts subscribers. 
    And, of course, if we receive Tax Analysts publication, the lawyers in the Department use the analysis that Tax Analysts has furnished. 
    I think that this Court's decision 33 days ago in describing the purposes of FOIA and the limitations on those purposes goes far toward providing the answer in this case, the decision in the Reporters Committee case involving rap sheets. 
    The basic policy of FOIA, the Court said, was focused on the citizen's right to be informed about what the agency is doing, what the government is up to, not to receive information that may be accumulated in the agency's files or other resources that reflects what somebody else has done, in that case information about a private citizen. 
    And quite tellingly, the Court quoted with approval, among various commentators about the act a... a comment in the Harvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review after saying that the Act was designed to expose official conduct to public scrutiny, and the two sentences quoted, with apparent approval by the Court from this comment, was that no statement was made in Congress that the Act was designed for a broader purpose, such as making the government's collection of data available to anyone who has any socially useful purpose for it. 
    For example, it was never suggested that the FOIA would be a boon to academic researchers by eliminating their need to assemble on their own data which the government has already collected.

    It... it does in the sense that any decision of the courts reflects whether the position of the litigants are adopted or rejected, just as if the court's decision said we believe we have to reject the government's position on the authority of our precedent in Perkins v. Parker. 
    Perkins v. Parker would shed light on what the government did in this case and why did it litigate this case in the face of Perkins v. Parker. 
    But it's... it's basically a court document reflecting what the court has done in the case, and it's being requested for that--
