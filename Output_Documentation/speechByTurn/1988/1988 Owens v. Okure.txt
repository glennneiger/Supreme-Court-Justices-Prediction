    Justice Marshall 
    In the first, Owens against Okure 8756, is on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    In this case, we hold that thoughts entertaining claims brought under 28 USC 1983 should borrow the frestoral of general personal injuries state statute of limitations and the Court of Appeals judgment is thereby affirmed.
