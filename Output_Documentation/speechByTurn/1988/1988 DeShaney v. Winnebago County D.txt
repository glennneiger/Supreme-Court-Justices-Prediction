    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 87-154, Joshua DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services. 
    Mr. Sullivan, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    We are here contending today not for a broad constitutional mandate to the states to do all good things to all people, nor do we contend for a broad constitutional duty to prevent all harm or all sadness, nor do we contend for a broad constitutional duty to protect all children in all cases.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    None in those situations--

    Unknown Speaker 
    Oh.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="45.661" stopTime="107.441">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --Justice White. 
    We do suggest that there is one and only one exquisitely narrow circumstance where there is an affirmative duty. 
    I would suggest that there are two primary elements to the one and only one circumstance for which we argue. 
    The first is the existence of a child/parent relationship. 
    The other is what I term enmeshment, intricate intimacy, enmeshment of the agents of the state in a particular circumstance which would have three characteristics: the first, an extreme danger to a particular individual child; the second, abundant actual knowledge on the part of the agents of the state; and the third, an actual undertaking by the state to protect the child.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="107.441" stopTime="111.023">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You derive all this from the language of the due process clause?
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="111.023" stopTime="287.800">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Indeed, Your Honor. 
    We think it arises from that and from the nature of the relationship and from the way the Court has... has accorded the relationship. 
    If I may... if I may explain. 
    It is my view... it is our view that the protector of the child, the raiser of the child, the person with the right and the power and the authority and the duty to educate the child, teach the child, provide medical care, all those parental things, including setting bedtime, is the parent and not the state. 
    The... the other side of that coin is that there is one and only one circumstance where when the family unit... and I don't care whether it's a married family or a step-parent or whatever, but when the child is at home and the door is closed to the world, the people with whom that child is locked in, his natural and his inherent protectors, from those individuals alone, whether it's a father, a step-mother, a live-in girlfriend of what have you... from those protectors alone he has no protection. 
    And in that one and only one circumstance, I think that's appropriate. 
    And I would further respond to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying this. 
    It is only in that one circumstance, as I understand the cases... it is only in that one circumstance that the Court has already interposed any aspect of the Constitution. 
    And I don't want that changed. 
    I don't ask that that be applied to a different circumstance. 
    What I'm saying is this. 
    Take the situation where the child is locked behind the door with his protector and the protector becomes the predator, and a proceeding is brought at the extreme end of the child protection spectrum to terminate the parental rights. 
    The Court has already said that the Constitution governs that relationship. 
    The Court has already recognized it in the relationship between the adult and the child that the Constitution prevails and it prevails both substantively and procedurally. 
    What I mean is this. 
    We know that any parent has a constitutionally recognized right to the... if I may simplify it, to the possession of the child, care, custody, companionship, all those... all those kinds of things that go with being a parent. 
    We also know that that right of parenthood cannot be terminated except by procedural due process protections. 
    So, I'm saying to the Court that in that most intimate relationship, the Court has already recognized that the Constitution has application. 
    The Court additionally has recognized, I believe, that a child... indeed, any of us... has a constitutionally protected right to physical integrity, to bodily protection. 
    What I'm suggesting--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="287.800" stopTime="289.799">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    A... a right against the state.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="289.799" stopTime="294.735">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --And a right that... that arises out of the Constitution to remain alive, yes, sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="294.735" stopTime="299.878">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but... but it's protected only against the state. 
    It's not protected against private individuals.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="299.878" stopTime="303.891">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Well, I think that's part of what the Court is going to have to address in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="303.891" stopTime="315.828">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why don't we start with the language of the Fourteenth Amendment which says that a state shall not... what does it state... deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="315.828" stopTime="316.186">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="316.186" stopTime="330.746">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Now, certainly we've held in many cases that the state may not deprive someone of life, but we've never held that that provision protects in the constitutional sense a private... a private attack on another person.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="330.746" stopTime="401.073">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    And I would further agree that in the... in the context in which prior to today that question has been addressed by the Court, I agree that that's the correct holding. 
    For example, if you were to hold otherwise, then the police department would have an obligation to prevent the mugging and a whole host of things that are simply unworkable and are not to be found in the Constitution. 
    What I... what I'm suggesting to you is that, first of all, this is a question in the most intimate relationship. 
    That has not been addressed, to my knowledge, by the Court before. 
    And I think that it's consistent with the nature of the circumstance that we're dealing with, and I think it's consistent with the other constitutional applications the Court has afforded to the child/parent relationship. 
    If you have... if you have the parent and child in an intimate relationship and the Constitution properly lies in... in that setting, and if the rights of the parent with all of his natural powers in addition... if the rights of the parent are recognized, why should the rights of the child be less recognized? 
    It... it seems to me that it's simply a balancing in--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="401.073" stopTime="406.817">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But... but the rights of the parent are recognized to the extent that the state may not interfere with it.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="406.817" stopTime="409.609">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --I think that's entirely true. 
    And--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="409.609" stopTime="419.744">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And the... and the question here is the extent to which you impose a mandatory duty on the state to act affirmatively to protect the child.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="419.744" stopTime="421.036">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --That's right, Justice--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="421.036" stopTime="428.682">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And the fact that it's... that other cases are not workable seems to me not the point. 
    The question is where do you derive the duty.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="428.682" stopTime="442.992">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --Well, it occurs to me that you derive the duty first and foremost from the nature of the... of the relationship that you're... that you're analyzing in a... in a constitutional setting, and secondly, from the fact that the Constitution does admittedly apply in that relationship.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="442.992" stopTime="465.465">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the only... the only cases in which the Court has found an affirmative duty on the part of the state to provide basic services is in a setting like a prison or a state institution where the state has already deprived the individual of the individual's liberty and institutionalized them.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="465.465" stopTime="466.817">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Justice O'Connor, I... I generally--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="466.817" stopTime="470.681">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This is certainly a step far beyond that that you're asking us to take.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="470.681" stopTime="513.488">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --The only word I would... I would differ with you is... is the word "far". 
    It occurs to me... obviously, the prison cases are in an Eighth Amendment context, so they are not... they are not the identical setting. 
    The institutionalized, hospitalized settings like Youngberg is the other category to which... to which I think you refer. 
    And I think that... I think that's what the notion of enmeshment... and that's not a phrase that I'm aware the Court has used. 
    That's... that's a... that's a word that I use for my own understanding and the clarity... I hope the clarity of my own thinking... that I think that's what's described there is to what extent has the state become involved in... in the life of this person. 
    If I may give an example.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="513.488" stopTime="536.722">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If... if your theory were to be accepted, it seems to me it would have a real deterrent effect on state child abuse programs. 
    Why would a state want to undertake a child abuse program at all if they face liability if they guess wrong? 
    I can't... I think you're asking the Court to take a step that is perhaps quite unwarranted and quite dangerous.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="536.722" stopTime="652.598">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    If... if the circumstance were as you... as you phrased it, Justice O'Connor, I would agree. 
    If... and the Seventh Circuit addressed that in its razor's edge argument. 
    The Seventh Circuit said you would put child protection authorities in a damned if we do, damned if we don't situation. 
    But this Court relatively recently decided Daniels and decided Davidson, and I think solves that problem entirely because I understand under... under those cases that even if we guess wrong, we are safe from liability. 
    And that's... that's vitally important here. 
    I understand Daniels and Davidson... again, to simplify in... in paraphrasing... to say even if you're negligent, it's okay in a 1983 setting. 
    And the Court reserved for another occasion... I think this may well be the occasion... the... the question of something more aggravated than... than negligence. 
    But what I'm saying is this. 
    In the whole range of state action dealing with children, all conduct that is... let's assume that we can recognize some standard. 
    All conduct that is proper, obviously, is not actionable. 
    All conduct that is negligent is not actionable. 
    And it has never been in contest that if we had the circumstance where the police officer or the child protection worker or someone else were inflicting a beating... you know, that's not the kind of case we're talking about. 
    And the next topic, obviously, that we have to address is the question of whether it's gross negligence, deliberate indifference or what have you. 
    So, I... I respectfully and very strongly suggest that it's not a question of do we guess wrong at our peril. 
    We... under the existing holdings of this Court, which I do not ask the Court to change, we've already said to the child protection agency it's okay to guess wrong. 
    It's okay if you make a mistake. 
    And that has to be. 
    I think government can't function without that--

    The second one--

    The Wisconsin standard is mere negligence. 
    The Wisconsin state tort law standard is mere negligence, and this Court has already said that's not acceptable in a 1983 context.

speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="819.281" stopTime="913.051">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Yes. 
    The... the... the hangup that... that I think I've seen in reading the colloquy in our briefs on the notion of intent... we do not argue... we certainly do not argue that the case worker or the supervisor or the county wanted this child dead. 
    That would be irresponsible, and we don't make that claim. 
    But we do, based on the record that's in... in front of you... and I think the joint appendix at 109 to 160 is the... is the DSS case file itself, and that I find shocking... quite candidly, I find shocking. 
    We know that there were... and Justice Brennan, you alluded to this. 
    There are black and white absolute mandates in the state statute that... that say when you receive a report from a doctor or from a nurse or from an outside social worker or from a police agency suggestive of child abuse, you shall investigate. 
    It doesn't go into you got to do it this way or that way, but you got to make a real investigation. 
    You got to do it in a timely manner. 
    On the first occasion in January of 1982 that the police reported suspected child abuse, they made an investigation which was cursory but I can't fault them at that point. 
    They complied with the statute. 
    In January of 1983, they had a doctor report from a hospital... they... saying I am finding an abused child here. 
    They take custody of the... of the child. 
    Three days later they send the child back to the abusive home.

    What she said, though, in--

    I want to get to the constitutional violation and when it occurred.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="994.553" stopTime="1049.521">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --All right. 
    What I... I need you to understand that she made a written promise to the child and to the family court that the very next time there was a suspicious lesion on this child, she would bring the matter back to the court for the child to be protected. 
    She made that... that promise to the... now, the child was a toddler, so I don't mean to say that child understood that. 
    But she made that guarantee and it was on that premise that the child I think erroneously was returned. 
    The very next time she was in the house all of the things that she had insisted on, all of the things that had been guaranteed by the birth father, all of the things that were necessary for the child's protection had been absolutely thrown out the window. 
    For example, the father told the county that it was the girlfriend who had abused him on this occasion. 
    And that's probably credible because he was out of town on a fishing trip. 
    So, he... he probably was not the physical abuser in that case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1049.521" stopTime="1058.296">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But just summarizing, what you're saying is it's... she got sufficient information on that occasion that she had a constitutional duty to remove the child. 
    And that was the... that was the constitutional violation.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --Well, that's the... that's the final argument in the Seventh Circuit's opinion that all we did was not stop it.

    The... the only protector he has in the world is now the predator.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Well, that's true in every child abuse situation. 
    Sure. 
    Wasn't that always true in a child abuse situation? 
    When a social worker visits a home, has very good reason to believe an abuse is going on, you're saying there's an immediate constitutional duty arise to remove the child if it's close enough to the knife at the throat example.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    Right.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But there is, of course, all shades of evidence.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    That's correct.

    It's pretty serious, but you say the evidence is clear enough so that the constitutional duty arose to remove the child.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    I think the evidence... and, yes, I do. 
    And I want to... I want to mention as well that the evidence, of course, is cumulative so that even if the second or third or fourth instance, if you feel that's not enough, the 14th or 15th or 20th instance certainly is. 
    You know, I... I lose track of how many different doctor reports of abuse there were and how many different nurse abusive reports there were... reports of abuse there were and how many direct observations on separate occasions by the case worker. 
    But I suggest to you that after two years, approximately, of this, when the case worker goes to the home and sees cigarette burns on the face of the child, I suggest that's knowledge.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1253.003" stopTime="1278.602">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What is magical about the fact that the citizen, here the child, is in threat from... from his father rather than from someone else? 
    Suppose a case worker goes in and finds an elderly person starving. 
    Why wouldn't there be a similar obligation on the part of the state? 
    Why wouldn't you... you find the state liable for depriving this person of life if the person dies because the state did not provide food? 
    Why wouldn't that--
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="1278.602" stopTime="1300.585">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    To the... to the best of my knowledge, in the first place the Constitution does not intrude into each individual life in the sense of an obligation to provide food, shelter, clothing. 
    That's a political issue. 
    The Constitution is interposed in the relationship between the child and its... and its parent. 
    And that's the only place in that... in that child's life where the... where the Constitution--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1300.585" stopTime="1307.741">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --How... how is the Constitution interposed there? 
    I don't... I don't see how it's interposed. 
    It's interposed when the state moves in and takes the child away and then gives it back.
speaker="donald_james_sullivan" startTime="1307.741" stopTime="1346.335">
    Mr. Donald James Sullivan 
    --It's interposed, more precisely, when the... when the state says we suspect there might be a problem for this child. 
    We're going to terminate your rights. 
    At that point there's no question but what the parent's constitutional rights in the relationship are recognized, both his substantive rights to his possession of his child and his procedural rights to have witnesses and hearings and burdens of proof and all those kinds of things. 
    And if we have one... one equation... and the Constitution is in here for the parent and we know the Constitution recognizes the child has at least the right to be alive and more or less healthy--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that's a... that's a limitation on the state... those cases. 
    They say the state can't do certain things. 
    You're trying to turn that around and say that arising out of that same relationship is a duty on the state.

    Mr. Donald James Sullivan

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, no doubt. 
    And what I'm saying is I don't see how you turn that around and say from these limitations on the state, we also derive a duty on the state.

   Argument of Mark J. Mingo
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="1745.691" stopTime="1845.017">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court: 
    We believe this case involves an attempt by the Petitioners to transform the private wrongdoing of a natural father into state action for purposes of invoking the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The primary issue presented is whether a county's failure to prevent the infliction of harm by a third party upon a person at liberty constitutes a due process violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We believe that there was no state deprivation of a constitutionally protected right for three main reasons. 
    First, the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of liberty does not include a right to basic protective services from the state. 
    Secondly, there is no state action in a constitutional sense which caused a deprivation in this case. 
    Third, we believe that the actions of the social worker did not evince the state of mind necessary to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In addition, we believe that there are two independent reasons for urging affirmance of the Seventh Circuit's decision. 
    First, with respect to the municipal Respondents, there was no policy or custom which led to a deprivation and with respect to the individual Respondents, we believe they are clearly entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1845.017" stopTime="1850.651">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The lower courts didn't reach any of those issues, did they, because they found there was no constitutional duty?
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="1850.651" stopTime="1922.239">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It seems to us that what Petitioners are attempting to do is use Section 1983, on one hand, and the Fourteenth Amendment on the other hand to affirmatively compel the states to act to protect. 
    Yet, in analyzing the... the legislative history and intent of Section 1983, it's quite clear that the statute was not designed for those purposes. 
    Section 1983 is remedial in nature. 
    Therefore, we must look to the... the constitutional right that the Petitioners seek to invoke by way of use of Section 1983, which brings us precisely to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment has been viewed by this Court as imposing no constitutional duty upon the states to provide substantive services to its citizens. 
    The Court also has held that if the state chooses to provide some form of protective services, the Fourteenth Amendment does not tell the state how far they must go in providing those services.

    Mr. Mingo, if this child had been in foster care placed by the state or the county, would there be potential liability?

    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    Justice O'Connor, in that instance, we believe there may well be potential liability because in that case we have, at least arguably, state action in the sense that the state took a child out of his natural surroundings, arguably put him in state-controlled surroundings and thereby increased the risk of harm to that child. 
    In that instance, I believe we may well have a case somewhat analogous to the prison setting and perhaps more analogous to the mental institution setting that was present in Youngberg v. Romeo.

    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    The agency I believe definitely did not have custody of the child.

    The reason that the child was placed in this hospital was for... primarily for... for observation and secondly because his father could not be located. 
    The child was examined. 
    After the three days in the hospital, it was the concurrence by the hospital personnel and by the Corporation Council that evidence of abuse could not be substantiated.

    The record is quite clear, though, that all of the professionals in this case, the pediatrician, the child psychologist, the police officer who investigated the case... they all believed that abuse could not be substantiated. 
    Every one of the professionals involved concurred, and the record is absolutely clear in that regard. 
    They all concurred that there was no evidence to substantiate a claim for child abuse.

    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    I'm now talking about the January 22 incident where the state arguably took custody or custody was placed with... with the hospital. 
    At that time there was an initial suspicion of child abuse which after the three-day stay in the hospital, all professionals agreed could not be confirmed. 
    In looking at this Court's decisions, it appears to us that state action has been found primarily in two settings: first, and most obviously, where the state goes out and directly inflicts harm upon an individual; secondly, state action has been found in a custodial setting where the state by its intentional act deprives a person of liberty, and by depriving that person of liberty, assumes a degree of control over that individual such that they have a reasonable means of protecting that individual, such as in a prison setting, and where they assume some responsibility for that individual's welfare.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr.... Mr. Mingo, I wonder if you wouldn't be better advised to use the term "constitutional duty" rather than state action. 
    There's no doubt that the social worker was a state actor. 
    She was a... she was a public employee doing this, and her acts were those of the state. 
    Your point really is that she was not under a constitutional duty to do certain things that your opponent says she was under a duty to do.
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="2413.113" stopTime="2426.381">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    Yes, Your Honor, you're quite correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And under your theory, I take it if two policemen see a rape and watch it just for their own amusement, no violation of the Constitution.
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="2437.361" stopTime="2444.733">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    We would concede that there is no constitutional violation in that particular case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You're not... you're arguing it as well as conceding it. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="2447.395" stopTime="2572.678">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    That's correct. 
    In this case it is undisputed by both sides that there was no direct deprivation or direct infliction of harm upon the Petitioners nor was the Petitioner in the custody of the state at the time of the alleged wrongdoing. 
    In order to circumvent the... the state action or constitutional deprivation requirement, counsel has proposed in their brief a special relationship theory which today they appear to call an enmeshment theory. 
    No matter what it is, this theory would hold states liable wherever they have expressed a desire to afford protection to an individual and where they have some generalized knowledge of the victim's plight. 
    We submit that such a theory has no support in the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, no support in Section 1983, nor does it have any support in any prior decision of this Court. 
    What their theory would do is open up local governments to massive new areas of exposure precisely because of the fact that the states, if we were to accept Petitioners' theory, become liable for the acts of private wrongdoers. 
    There are numerous governmental agencies other than social services departments which seek to afford some degree of protection to the public. 
    Certainly police departments, fire departments, emergency ambulance services fall into that very same category. 
    It seems to us that if Petitioners are to prevail in these types of cases, the effect will be to greatly expand the financial drain on local governments thereby making the very services that Petitioners claim they wish to encourage less available to the public as a whole.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2572.678" stopTime="2577.771">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Mingo, under Wisconsin law, does Joshua have a cause of action against his father?
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="2577.771" stopTime="2586.376">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    He certainly would have a cause of action against his father. 
    In fact, his--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2586.376" stopTime="2591.612">
    Unknown Speaker 
    No... no barrier between child/parent relationship?
speaker="mark_j_mingo" startTime="2591.612" stopTime="2796.432">
    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    --That... that immunity was done away in Wisconsin some 10 or 15 years ago. 
    And, in fact, I might note that Randy DeShaney, the father, was in fact a party defendant to this action when it was first... when the complaint was first filed. 
    He was subsequently dismissed on a voluntary basis by counsel. 
    So, he was in fact a party defendant, and there was no objection on the basis of immunity. 
    Again, we wish to emphasize that the problem with this special relationship or enmeshment theory is that it fails to distinguish between privately inflicted harm and state action. 
    On the other hand, we believe that the Court's adherence to the traditional state action or constitutional deprivation requirement provides a bright line standard which would separate actions of private wrongdoing from actions which can fairly or truly be attributed to the states. 
    We also believe that the Petitioners cannot prevail upon their Fourteenth Amendment claim because the social workers in this case did not evince the state of mind necessary to support a Fourteenth Amendment action. 
    This Court has recently told us in Daniels and Davidson that negligence certainly is not enough. 
    And the Court also indicated to us that traditionally the due process clause has been applied to deliberate decisions by government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty or property. 
    This case we believe is even less constitutionally compelling than Daniels and Davidson because we are not dealing with a custodial setting, and we are faced with claims of inaction versus action. 
    In such circumstances, we have proposed that the requisite state of mind must be that of deliberate indifference or a failure to act. 
    And the reason we propose this heightened state of mind requirement is twofold. 
    First, we believe it avoids trivializing the Constitution by allowing individuals to bring ordinary tort claims in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And we also believe that this heightened state of mind requirement recognizes the real-life dilemma which front-line social workers and many other governmental workers face on a daily basis. 
    As the Seventh Circuit indicated below, social workers truly do operate on a razor's edge. 
    First, a social worker must respect the constitutional rights of a parent to the care, custody and management of their children. 
    Secondly, where a social worker's involvement is on a purely voluntary basis, such as it was in this particular case, she must walk a fine line to avoid having the door slammed in her face thereby preventing any future involvement of the department. 
    This--

    Mr. Mark J. Mingo

    The only duty she had under state law was to investigate when she received a report of abuse. 
    The only report of abuse which the department ever received in this case was the initial report of suspected abuse. 
    Immediately following that report, there was an investigation. 
    The child was placed in the hospital for three days and then, since there was no filing of a petition at the end of three days, the child was automatically returned to the home. 
    After that first incident, there was absolutely no further reports of abuse.

    Mr. Mark J. Mingo 
    The only way I can answer that question, Justice Marshall, is to tell you that a formal investigation is one that's triggered by a statute. 
    An informal investigation is one voluntarily undertaken by the social worker. 
    The net effect may be the same, but the triggering process is different.

    What I've been attempting to argue is that a formal report is required to trigger an investigation. 
    If she receives a formal report, then she does have some affirmative duties imposed upon her by the statute. 
    The statute says she shall investigate.

   Argument of Donald B. Ayer
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3045.257" stopTime="3302.829">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I want to address the... the due process... the deprivation of due process analysis briefly if I could, but before I do, I'd like to say a few words about the relationship between federal and state government and the role of the federal Constitution because I think it is reasonably clear that the area of child protection is not one that is crying out for federal constitutional oversight. 
    First of all, it is not an area where there is any sort of history of hostility between the state and the interests that we're talking about trying to protect. 
    Quite the contrary. 
    There being no constitutional right to this protection in the first place, it's clear I think that the state programs that have been set up have all been set up as a matter of state and local government initiative born of exactly the same sentiments and concerns that everyone feels toward children who are exposed to the kinds of abuse and hazards that we're sadly reviewing in this case. 
    So, we don't have... we don't have a... a state actor who there is a need to step in front of and stop in any sort of habitual way. 
    The state is actively intervening to do all that it reasonably can do. 
    Second of all, I think there's no reason to think that federal oversight, federal constitutional oversight, is going to add very much to the handling of these sensitive and difficult problems. 
    There is I think little reason to think that federal courts have any special expertise in the reviewing of what is at least in some sense a balance between interests of parents, respect for the interest of parents in controlling their children, as opposed to the priority of intervening when you... when you need to and must in order to protect the child. 
    It's the kind of a sensitive situation that requires close, on-the-scene involvement, the exercise of discretion and the exercise of a great deal of care and concern. 
    It's an area of... of traditional state law involvement and local government handling. 
    And the idea that at a federal court review engrafted on top of what is already in place, machinery that has been put in place by the state and local governments... the idea that that is going to help rather than hurt I think is... is really a misguided one. 
    We're talking about a number of things. 
    We're talking about, number one, creating another layer of judicial action, judicial review, which itself will result in delay. 
    It will divert resources from the... the real everyday problems and the handling of these personal situations. 
    We are talking possibly not only about awarding damages and creating a... a chill and a discouraging factor which Justice O'Connor alluded to being involved at all, also a day-to-day possible, I suppose, injunctive role for the federal courts coming involved not only after the fact when something has happened to award damages, but becoming involved as these cases evolve. 
    You go to the local court. 
    You go to your local social service agency. 
    You go to the local court, and then you go to federal court. 
    The idea that that is somehow going to help the resolution of these problems seems to be... seems to be misguided, and I think there is a good reason to fear that it may well just primarily discourage the involvement of local agencies for fear that they're going to be facing an unmanageable and very expensive situation. 
    All of that is basically irrelevant unless it is wholly consistent with the law and what the Constitution requires. 
    And very briefly I'd like to say that I think it's quite clear that when you take to heart the Court's statements that the due process clause is not to be a font of tort policy which will evolve as tort policy does in response to various economic and distributive concerns and theories and... and sort of comes and goes with... with social concerns and the social situation, it's clear that we can't create the liability which is requested by the Petitioner here without really creating an open-ended possibility--

    It might change depending on the particular facts you're talking about, but I... I think it has got to turn on whether what happens can be described as an abuse of government power which is a moving force behind the harm that is taking place.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, it might be possible to write a statute in a way that created a procedural due process interest. 
    I don't know quite how you'd do that, but you'd have to link... the words would have to be fairly mandatory and would have to link rather closely to the harm that you're talking about now occurring. 
    And if that happened, the question would then be about the adequacy of the remedy that was provided for... for the harm when it did in fact occur.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, in most cases, I would think there would be. 
    And, of course, the point I guess I was making earlier in summary is that there is no reason why we can't rely on the mechanisms of state and local government to create the remedies that are appropriate in these circumstances.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --That's right. 
    That's right. 
    And... and I think... I think the way that one... what one would have to do to violate equal protection of the law is... is useful in thinking about how to think about a violation of due process in the sense that there the denial of equal protection which could, in fact, be other than an affirmative act or... or the government being a moving force behind the harm, nonetheless it must be intentional. 
    It must be an act which intends the result... the denial of the protection that they otherwise would be entitled to. 
    And I would suggest that that concept of intent... whereas it's... it probably is not the best way to decide this case, I would suggest that an intent to take an action which does deprive one of liberty, such as by putting... putting them in jail, putting them into a mental facility or something like that, that that's the kind of intent that you ought to have to have. 
    That's an issue, of course, the Court did not reach in Davidson and Daniels as to whether that degree of intent is required. 
    We would suggest that it is.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, I... I... I would think not and the reason would be that the removal in this case was a temporary removal for specific purposes. 
    The father remained the legal custodian of the child. 
    No affirmative action had been taken to determine that the... the father was unfit and that the expiration of this temporary period, absent further action, the child was going to go back to... to the parent. 
    And the fact that it did not take that affirmative action, but rather let the status quo continue, I think is not the kind of affirmative action that you've got to have in order to have the state be the moving force... its abuse of power be the moving force behind the injury that occurred.
