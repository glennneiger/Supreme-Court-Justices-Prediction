Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1729, Caplin &amp; Drysdale v. United States. 
    Mr. Lockwood, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="11.122" stopTime="268.273">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue that the Court is faced with here today is whether the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution permit the federal government to deprive a... an unconvicted defendant of access to his assets to employ counsel to defend him against the very charges on which the proposed forfeiture in the indictment is based and to obtain necessary living expenses. 
    The facts, briefly stated, in Caplin &amp; Drysdale are... is that the Petitioner, the law firm of Caplin &amp; Drysdale, was retained in the summer of 1983 by the Defendant Christopher Reckmeyer to represent him in a matter then understood to be a grand jury investigation involving possible federal tax evasion. 
    In January of 1985, Reckmeyer was indicted for not only a multiplicity of tax crimes, but a multiplicity of drug crimes and a... charged with a violation of the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute or CCE. 
    The indictment also contained what I will refer to in shorthand as blanket forfeiture allegations which essentially sought forfeiture of every asset Reckmeyer owned that was worth more than $1,000. 
    Approximately simultaneously with the entry of the indictment, the government, ex parte, obtained a temporary restraining order against Reckmeyer and all persons acting in concert with him from transferring any of the assets listed as forfeitable in the indictment. 
    Immediately prior to the indictment, Reckmeyer had paid Caplin &amp; Drysdale $10,000 by check for previously incurred legal fees. 
    That check... those checks were returned unpaid by the banks as a result of the restraining order. 
    Shortly after the indictment, Reckmeyer paid Caplin &amp; Drysdale approximately $25,000 in cash, again for previous... pre-indictment legal services. 
    Because of the restraining order, Caplin &amp; Drysdale deposited that money in an escrow account and immediately notified both the court and the government of its receipt of those funds. 
    Thereafter, Caplin &amp; Drysdale continued to represent Reckmeyer in the criminal proceedings. 
    Some weeks after the indictment, Caplin &amp; Drysdale filed on Reckmeyer's behalf a motion with the district court for... to amend the temporary restraining order to allow Reckmayer access to his restrained assets to pay counsel and, in addition, requested that the assets so relieved from restraint would be exempted from subsequent forfeiture in the event Reckmeyer should be convicted. 
    That motion came on for a hearing, but the day prior to the hearing, Reckmeyer pleaded guilty. 
    As a result, the district court deferred ruling on the motion to some post-conviction procedures under Subsection N(2) of the CCE forfeiture statute. 
    At that subsequent... subsequent hearing, Caplin &amp; Drysdale at this point, petitioning on its own behalf for the fees, pursuant to the court's instruction... and the court granted Caplin &amp; Drysdale's motion. 
    In the interim, while those proceedings were transpiring, Reckmeyer also consented to the entry of a forfeiture decree against him, which once again covered all the assets listed in the indictment and included the bank accounts on which the $10,000 in unpaid checks were drawn and the 25,000 odd dollars that was in the possession of Caplin &amp; Drysdale in the escrow account.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Lockwood, what are the requirements for a forfeiture? 
    That the... the monies or property have been acquired as a result of the drug activities?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="277.897" stopTime="289.372">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are a variety of properties which are subject to forfeiture in Section 853(a). 
    They include proceeds of drug transactions, but--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="289.372" stopTime="299.995">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I didn't mean so much the various kinds of properties, but what does the government have to show in order to forfeit any property? 
    That it be acquired from drug proceeds?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="299.995" stopTime="304.049">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --The government has to show... well, the government first has to convict the defendant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="304.049" stopTime="304.565">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="304.565" stopTime="354.481">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Secondly, having convicted it, it has to show that the property was either obtained or used in the manner proscribed by the statute itself which, as I say, involves a variety of different considerations including, for example, that the property in a RICO case, which has an identical statute to the one at issue here, was a portion of the enterprise that the defendant conducted by a pattern of racketeering activity. 
    For example, if an enterprise is a legitimate business, but the defendant participated in two or more predicate crimes which were deemed to be a pattern of racketeering activity, the defendant's entire interest in the enterprise could be forfeited, not merely that portion of the enterprise's assets that resulted from the criminal activity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="354.481" stopTime="357.933">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What was the basis for the forfeiture against Reckmeyer here?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="357.933" stopTime="363.170">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Well, the ultimate basis was Reckmeyer's consent.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="363.170" stopTime="363.620">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but--
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="363.620" stopTime="366.205">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    There was never any litigation or findings--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="366.205" stopTime="368.988">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Doesn't the court have... doesn't the court have to make any findings or anything like that?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="368.988" stopTime="498.773">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --Not if the defendant consents. 
    It's... it's just like a guilty plea in that regard, Your honor. 
    The... we believe there are certain basic principles that have to be kept in mind in evaluating the arguments over whether or not the lower court was correct in ruling that Caplin &amp; Drysdale should be paid the legal fees from Reckmeyer's assets that it had earned, or whether the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit en banc was correct in holding that neither the statute nor the... the applicable constitutional provisions authorize such a result. 
    The first point is that, unlike the government's argument at various places in its brief which suggests that this is simply a dispute over property rights, forfeiture is a criminal penalty in this statute. 
    It is imposed only upon conviction of the defendant and is... it was enacted as an effort to punish the defendant for his wrongful conduct and deter others from engaging in similar conduct. 
    The restraining order provisions in both the CCE and the RICO statutes were intended by Congress... this much both sides agree on... to prevent a defendant from avoiding the impact of forfeiture by disposing of his property prior to forfeiture but after indictment in a manner which would, for example, allow him to retain the economic and beneficial ownership of that property, which we would refer to as a sham transaction, or which would enable his organization... the statute... these statutes were, after all, aimed at criminal organizations... to maintain its continued use of the assets in criminal activity. 
    This would be involved in transferring assets to other members of the criminal organization. 
    The issue in this case--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="498.773" stopTime="504.094">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean... there... there... there is not agreement on both sides that that's the only purpose.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="504.094" stopTime="540.000">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --Your... Justice Scalia, I didn't mean to say it was agreement that that was the only purpose. 
    It is agreement that that is a major purpose. 
    I was about to say that the... the disagreement between the parties has to do with how much farther Congress intended to go than those basic purposes and specifically whether Congress intended that the government, by indicting a defendant and including blanket forfeiture allegations, could in fact render a defendant functionally indigent prior to the time of his conviction for the offenses on which the forfeiture charges were based.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="540.000" stopTime="556.092">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that... is that your principal contention here, that the forfeiture... or the tying up of the assets simply on the basis of an indictment is not right? 
    I thought you would object also to a later recapture of those, even after a conviction.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="556.092" stopTime="557.961">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="557.961" stopTime="562.663">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, it isn't just the fact that it is just an indictment. 
    You object to the thing even after a conviction.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="562.663" stopTime="611.762">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist. 
    Our view is that the so-called relation-back provision of the statute which purports to vest title to the... of the defendant's asset in the government at the time the defendant committed the crime and therefore prohibits the transfer of any such assets to a third party at any time after that crime, subject to very narrow exceptions, has exactly the same practical effect as restraint because no third party, whether they be a lawyer, a grocer, a surgeon or whoever, who is... who is aware through publicity or otherwise that the defendant has been indicted is going to transfer goods or services to the defendant--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="611.762" stopTime="612.212">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It's like a--
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="612.212" stopTime="615.881">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --In exchange for money that the government can come and take back if the defendant is convicted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="615.881" stopTime="618.850">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --It is like a lis pendens in a civil action.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="618.850" stopTime="626.189">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Short of the formality of filing the lis pendens with the court, it is exactly the same, Justice Rehnquist.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="626.189" stopTime="634.877">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But your claim is limited to compensation for services performed prior to conviction.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="634.877" stopTime="636.727">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Prior to conviction, that is correct, Justice White.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="636.727" stopTime="644.483">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you think you should be paid either before or after conviction for those services.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="644.483" stopTime="742.647">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    As long as the services were rendered prior to conviction, it is our position that the procedural context of when the lower court got around to deciding that we were entitled to be paid is irrelevant. 
    The... the key factor is that Reckmeyer had a... a statutory and constitutional right to pay us prior to his conviction, and the conviction does not cut that right off, as the government seems to suggest. 
    The... part of the... the issue here is that the government's arguments about why the statute should be interpreted in the way it claims, which is to provide that this pre-conviction impact through either restraint or threat of forfeiture is appropriate, is that the government has a legitimate interest which the Congress in its view clearly intended in drafting of this statute in maximizing the forfeiture penalty by "preserving assets for forfeiture". 
    It is our position that, if analyzed correctly, that interest, to the extent that it purports to be penal, cannot be given any legal or constitutional effect prior to conviction. 
    You cannot punish someone prior to the time they are convicted of the crime. 
    So--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="742.647" stopTime="756.156">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you... it's your position that... I mean, that... that relation back to the date of the offense is just... you shouldn't construe the statute that way or that if you do, it's unconstitutional?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="756.156" stopTime="757.740">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --We do not--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="757.740" stopTime="773.285">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What about an... what about just a bank loan that the defendant owed and was due and it was owing? 
    Do you think the... do you think the bank can collect that? 
    Or are you--
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="773.285" stopTime="774.052">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --Well, under the statute--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="774.052" stopTime="780.289">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --[inaudible] something special out of the fact that these are counsel fees?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="780.289" stopTime="797.117">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --Well, we are and we aren't, Justice White. 
    We... we... in the pre-conviction setting, we would not under the statute, as opposed to the Sixth Amendment argument, distinguish between counsel fees and other necessary living expenses. 
    We don't--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="797.117" stopTime="798.950">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    xxx bank loan?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="798.950" stopTime="837.109">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --A bank loan, depending upon the circumstances under which it would be made, the bank could very well qualify as a bona fide for... purchaser for value without notice. 
    There is a dispute between the government and... and various claimants in the lower courts, which is not presented by this case, over whether a "mere creditor" can get assets that are not forfeited if the bank did not obtain a security interest. 
    It's clear under the statute if the bank loaned money and obtained a security interest prior to the time the defendant was indicted, the bank could get the repayment of that loan out of the forfeited assets.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="837.109" stopTime="842.346">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what about the money that is claimed to be the proceeds of a bank robbery?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="842.346" stopTime="849.683">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Chief Justice Scalia, we would... excuse me... Chief Justice Rehnquist.

    [Laughter]
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="856.622" stopTime="887.291">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    We would argue that the bank robbery analogy is not apt. 
    In the bank robbery analogy, you have a common law fight over title to property. 
    We do not posit that Reckmeyer or anybody else has the right to use somebody else's property to pay a lawyer or for any other purpose. 
    But here, the notion that the assets that Reckmeyer has in his possession at the time of indictment belonged to the government--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="887.291" stopTime="887.691">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But--

    --by operation is a fiction. 
    It's a penalty.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="890.543" stopTime="906.789">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, but... but why can't the federal government make property law the same way state governments make property law when they say that the... that the money deposited in a bank belongs to a bank? 
    Why can't the federal government say on the happening of certain events, this property belongs to United States?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="906.789" stopTime="939.343">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    They can, provided that they have a particular, legitimate constitutional purpose. 
    The Congress under the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment could not pass a statute that said Peter Lockwood's property belongs to the government. 
    There has to have a legitimate purpose. 
    In this case the... the legitimate purpose behind the forfeiture statute is the... is penalizing criminals. 
    Our... we do not challenge the legitimacy of that purpose. 
    We challenge the impact of the penalty being applied prior to the time that the defendant is convicted.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="939.343" stopTime="960.756">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But the only legitimate basis for imposing the penalty is the wrongful act and, therefore, it is perfectly proper... in fact, I should think necessary... for the government to make the statute relate back to the occurrence of the wrongful act, which is all it has done here. 
    That is the whole predicate for the government asserting the ownership interest.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="960.756" stopTime="1023.163">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    That's correct, Justice Kennedy, as long as you don't push the principle too far because if the issue... to the extent the statute and the forfeiture provisions are directed at the defendant himself, it is perfectly appropriate for the statute by way of a penalty to look back to the time that the criminal act was committed for purpose of identifying the forfeitable property. 
    When you get to transfers to third parties who are presumptively innocent, different considerations are presented, and where you get to depriving a defendant under the notion that we are going to take this property from him after he is convicted, depriving him of the use of property to hire a lawyer to defend himself against the very charges which, if he wins, the forfeiture will not occur, we... we urge that that is a very draconian type of remedy. 
    It is an infliction of punishment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1023.163" stopTime="1059.603">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's a... that's a different theory. 
    Now... now, you're getting into the right to counsel aspect of it. 
    You said in response to the Chief Justice's question a short time ago that on... your objection to relation back means that you would not draw a distinction between attorney's fees and other necessary living expenses. 
    If I... but if I understand your... your theory correctly, you shouldn't be drawing a distinction between attorneys' fees and anything else the individual does with the money. 
    He could go out and just say, you know, I know I'm going to get convicted. 
    They have the goods on me. 
    Boy, I'm going to really live for the two years it takes for this trial to be... to be completed.

    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    We didn't say that the relation-back doctrine is unconstitutional on its face. 
    We were... we... I'm arguing that the relation-back doctrine cannot legitimately be used in a very limited class of cases where the impact of the use of the relation-back doctrine is not to preserve the status quo, which is the normal purpose for equitable relief, but to dramatically alter the status quo to the defendant's is detriment by rendering him indigent functionally by mere indictment alone.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you must be reasoning from something else other than the mere relation back then.

    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Well, we... the statutory--

    --because if you really think that you can't take it away from him until he is convicted, he ought to have the right to do whatever he wants with that money during the period while the trial is continuing.
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="1134.234" stopTime="1226.160">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --In the statutory context, Justice Scalia, we are relying on language in the statute which we contend gives the court an equitable discretion both under the restraining order provisions and under the relation-back provisions. 
    And that involves balancing of hardships in the government's interest. 
    And we concede that the... in that context, the government's interest in avoiding the dissipation of assets, whether it's through a restraining order or the application of relation-back principles, is entitled to sufficient weight to prohibit what Your Honor has suggested would be otherwise appropriate, namely, dissipation of assets. 
    We suggest, as did Judge Winter in his opinion in Monsanto, that the equitable discretion inherent in the statute cannot be utilized, however, to render the defendant a pauper. 
    With respect to the constitutional argument, we... we... we say that... our argument is essentially that you've got to balance the invasion of the defendant's right to counsel of choice against the government's interest. 
    The relation-back principle in that context... the government's interest in its application is to maximize the amount of money it will collect as a penalty from the defendant when he is convicted. 
    That is its only legitimate interest. 
    It does not have a legitimate interest in putting the defendant in a posture in which the government picks his lawyer and chooses how much to pay his lawyer.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, of course, that... that's the issue.

    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    --Justice Kennedy, the problem is that at the time of the impact of the restraint and forfeiture, the defendant's assets are only claimed by the government to be illegal. 
    They have not been proven to be illegally obtained, and they will only be so proven when the defendant is convicted at the criminal trial. 
    But the government, if the statute is to be interpreted the way it argues, is in effect tying one hand behind the defendant's back by depriving him of his ability to hire a lawyer to contest the charges on which the proposed forfeiture is based.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Lockwood, what if the defendant has as his property a stash of narcotics, which he had been planning to sell, and also money that he had obtained from prior sales of narcotics according to the government's allegations? 
    Do you think that he can use that money constitutionally pending the trial and conviction?
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="1309.898" stopTime="1332.179">

    We would concede he could not use the narcotics.

    The government could, I believe, make a different case from the one that is presented here if the assets sought to be seized were alleged to be needed to be used for evidence because that gets into a different set of constitutional considerations more like the typical ones that this Court has upheld in... in prior cases where counsel of choice was at issue, namely, the due and fair administration of justice. 
    Here, where the only interest is money, the only interest on the government side of the equation is maximization of the penalty regardless of what the basis for that penalty is. 
    The... the government's rationale could as easily apply in this case to... to tying up assets of a defendant to enable him to pay fines.

    What... what if you applied the government's rationale to your rather standard forfeiture of an automobile used in transporting drugs, nothing to do with CCE or RICO?

   Argument of William C. Bryson
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1655.855" stopTime="1803.869">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    At the outset, I'd like to make a couple of points applicable to both of the cases before Court today, and then turn to the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case. 
    First, it is important I think to point out the procedural posture that these two cases present. 
    There are two basic issues that have been litigated in the so-called attorneys' fee forfeiture cases. 
    One is the substantive question, which is the question that is presented in these cases, of whether funds that a defendant wishes to use to pay an attorney may be forfeited at all, consistent with the statute and the Sixth Amendment, and the second is a procedural question which is not presented in this... these cases, but has come up in other cases, involving what kind of procedures the courts must go through, if any, to establish the right to a forfeiture, that is to say, should... must there be a pretrial hearing of some sort and what must that hearing consist in. 
    Now, the reason, of course, that these two cases don't present the procedural point is simply that in the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case, there was a guilty plea simultaneously with the motion to modify the restraining order and, therefore, we know as of the time that the restraining order modification motion was filed, that the defendant was, in fact, guilty of the crimes and that he, in fact, was subject to the forfeiture provisions with respect to all of the property that he conceded was forfeitable. 
    And in the Monsanto case, the court of appeals panel required and the district court held a pretrial hearing long before any counsel had to prepare for the trial in which it was determined, as the district court found, by overwhelming evidence that the defendant had committed the crimes and that the property was forfeitable. 
    So... so, these cases present the substantive question in a very stark posture. 
    They present the question whether... that if we know to either a certainty or by overwhelming likelihood that the fees are... excuse me... that the... the property in issue is subject to forfeiture, must that property nonetheless be excluded from a forfeiture order. 
    And our position on that is that neither statute nor the Sixth Amendment requires that result.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1803.869" stopTime="1809.673">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you assert that the Fifth Amendment issue, the due process issue, is not involved here at all.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1809.673" stopTime="1826.917">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, the... there is a Fifth Amendment issue with respect... a general Fifth Amendment claim that is made by Caplin &amp; Drysdale with respect to the question of whether it violates the Fifth Amendment to put this kind of authority in the hands of prosecutors. 
    It's related to the Sixth Amendment question. 
    The procedural due process question--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1826.917" stopTime="1827.317">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1827.317" stopTime="1829.252">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --we believe is not presented in these cases.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1829.252" stopTime="1830.636">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    As to whether you need a hearing--
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1830.636" stopTime="1831.538">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    A hearing. 
    That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1831.538" stopTime="1832.288">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --and what has to be shown at that hearing.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1832.288" stopTime="1872.865">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    That's right. 
    And, indeed, the court of appeals in Caplin &amp; Dryscales en banc court, made exactly that point and pointed out that in light of the posture of this case, we are really presented only with the... the flat, substantive question of whether forfeiture is possible without regard to the strength of the government's case. 
    In other words, this is, in essence, the case that I think Justice Stevens put in which we know... because the bills are marked, we know that this money belongs to the government. 
    In this case we know that the money belongs to the government not because the bills are marked, which gives us a very high degree certitude, but because the defendant admitted that he was guilty and that the money was forfeitable, which gives us a complete degree of certitude, as much as the law--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1872.865" stopTime="1878.167">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but of course, you didn't have that before the guilty plea. 
    You didn't have that degree of certitude then.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1878.167" stopTime="1906.419">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --When we had it, Your Honor, was... and let me give you the chronologies because I think it may be important. 
    There was an indictment in January, and six weeks passed and then on March 7th, the defendant made a motion to vacate or modify the restraining order in order to provide for the payment of attorneys' fees. 
    That was the first time the court or the government heard anything from the defendant about the question of whether there should be attorneys' fees--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1906.419" stopTime="1910.221">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, that's true. 
    But during that six-week period, you did not have the certitude that you had described.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And part of the issue is what can be done during that six-weeks period.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1914.542" stopTime="1914.992">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    That's right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1914.992" stopTime="1929.285">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Say h makes... pays his landlord his rent during that six-weeks period, and the landlord hears about the indictment and has reason to be believe maybe this fellow is a crook and maybe this is tainted money. 
    But your position is the landlord cannot take the money during that period, as I understand it.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1929.285" stopTime="1941.975">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    That's right. 
    And... and the... in order to trigger any right to a contrary result, the defendant has to make some kind of motion, tell the court that there is something wrong with this regime. 
    The first time that happened--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1941.975" stopTime="1947.746">

    When the offense was committed... say he's indicted for drug business.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2011.606" stopTime="2116.087">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Bryson, what if we thought that it was necessary before trial that there be a hearing at which evidence would be taken and the defendant would have an opportunity to rebut the government's claims, and that procedural due process requires that? 
    What does that do in the Caplin case do you think? 
    Your Honor, nothing at all because here, as I say, the request for a modification and a hearing on the... on the motion for modification was filed on March 7th. 
    The hearing was... came or quite quickly, on March 15th. 
    But, in fact, in the meantime, on March 14th, the defendant had pleaded guilty and had conceded forfeitability. 
    So, there was nothing to hear at that point. 
    All that was presented at that point was the naked constitutional and statutory question. 
    Now, in the Monsanto case, there is a pretrial hearing. 
    And that hearing, we contend, was beyond what any court has required that has required some kind of due process hearing because in that hearing, not only was it an adversarial hearing and a four-day hearing at that, in which the defendant was entitled to put on any evidence that... that he chose, but also the finding that the property was forfeitable was made by a standard of proof beyond clear and convincing. 
    So, our... our point is that in... in both of these cases, the Court does not have to address the question of what procedure is necessary because whatever procedure is necessary was necessarily satisfied here. 
    Well, Mr. Bryson, you say that as soon as he pled guilty, he was... he conceded forfeitability.

    Mr. Bryson, you say you don't have to address it here, but do you think that a post-indictment restraining order can be obtained ex parte by the government?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2621.136" stopTime="2700.469">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There is... the restraining order itself clearly can be obtained simply... as the statute makes clear, simply by petitioning to the district court ex parte. 
    And, in fact, there is a lot in the legislative history that indicates that that... it is important that it be able to be done that way because of the possibility of transfers being done very quickly if notice is given of the restraining order. 
    The... however, as the... the legislative history also makes clear, the... excuse me... the court certainly can hold a hearing at any time after the restraining order is entered to consider modifying the restraining order or vacating it altogether. 
    Now, that's when in our view any process that may be due is properly to come into play. 
    So, in our view, the... whatever due process is required applies to any hearing that may be held on a motion to modify the restraining order if one has been entered post-indictment. 
    The actual right to enter the restraining order initially can... applies... it could be done ex parte.

    May I just ask one other preliminary question because I... you do... you do have... fortunately you have two hours today, so we're not quite as unfair as we sometimes are. 
    The general scheme is the some under both the RICO statute and the CCE statute--

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Yes, that's right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2718.280" stopTime="2724.384">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --so that whatever we decide pertaining to the drug business applies to everyone subject to RICO, too. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2724.384" stopTime="2728.621">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    It applies to everyone subject to RICO in which there is a forfeiture allegation. 
    I would have to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2728.621" stopTime="2729.188">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2729.188" stopTime="2738.844">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --I would hasten to point out that the number of cases that are affected is vastly more in the context of... of narcotics forfeiture than RICO.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2738.844" stopTime="2741.246">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why do you say that? 
    There are an awful lot of RICO cases.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2741.246" stopTime="2747.467">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, there are, but we only have about 50 cases a year in which RICO forfeitures are sought. 
    We have many more than that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2747.467" stopTime="2749.652">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but potentially there are an awful lot more than that.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2749.652" stopTime="2942.627">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Well, that's right, but then we only have about 100 RICOs a year, total. 
    It's... RICO is... you see a lot of the RICO cases, of course, because most of them are appealed all the way up, but in spite of the disproportionate number that you see, there are, in fact, a very small number that are actually brought. 
    So, it's 100 cases out of a total of 50,000 criminal cases that are brought a year. 
    So, proportionately the vast majority of... of cases in which forfeiture is going to be an issue will be drug cases. 
    That's right. 
    Now, on the constitutional question... and let me... let me turn directly to that... it is our view that the Sixth Amendment requires only... with respect to the right to counsel of choice, only that there be no arbitrary or unreasonable limitation of the right to counsel of choice. 
    It's different from the right to counsel, period. 
    And the question then in this case is does the forfeiture statute operate in a way that is somehow arbitrary or unreasonable. 
    And what in this context the question really comes down to is is it arbitrary or unreasonable to bar defendants from using to pay lawyers' fees money that has been determined, as in these cases, either conclusively or by overwhelming evidence to be subject to forfeiture, to be, in other words, the government's money. 
    Now, the first question I guess one could start with is to say is there any constitutional flaw in the process of... or in... in the fact of determining that this is, in fact, the tainted money, money that was obtained as a result of drug transactions, is forfeitable. 
    Is there any Fifth Amendment bar to that? 
    Now, Mr. Lockwood said, and quite correctly, the government couldn't simply... the Congress couldn't simply declare that Mr. Lockwood's funds are forfeitable, all of his property is forfeitable. 
    But what we submit there would be absolutely no Fifth Amendment bar to is a rule that says any of his property that are the proceeds of drug transactions are forfeitable. 
    And that's a... a traditional civil notion, and it is, we... we'd submit, entirely consistent with the Fifth Amendment to do that. 
    That's what Congress has done. 
    Now, once you accepted that it is permissible, then the only remaining question is whether there is something arbitrary about saying that the defendant cannot use those funds, funds that the government... that Congress has declared belong to the government, to hire a lawyer. 
    There is, in our view, no Sixth Amendment right to use somebody else's property to hire a lawyer, and that's what's going on in this case. 
    As I say, we have in this case established with a high degree of confidence that this is the government's property, and that is what the defendants are contending for is that even though the government has established that it is government property, they are entitled to dip into that property to the extent necessary to hire the lawyers of their choice.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So, suppose you had a statute which permitted the defendant to have ordinary living expenses and to pay for grocery and medical bills, but it specifically prevented use of the proceeds to pay an attorney.

    Would that be constitutional?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2958.905" stopTime="2965.825">

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    There are no exemptions. 
    That's right. 
    This is not a statute in which Congress has set out to skew the scales between the defense and the... and the government. 
    And that I think makes a big difference for purposes of looking at the constitutionality of the statute. 
    There are a lot of situations in which the defendant's property posture with respect to his property can affect the likelihood that a lawyer will... will take on his representation. 
    And some of them relate to the defendant's just not having the money. 
    Others relate to the defendant's situation with respect to other creditors, and some of them relate to problems that the defendant may have with respect to creditors where the creditor is the government. 
    And I would just give you examples. 
    Suppose, for example, the defendant had... prior to his criminal trial, had been slapped with a jeopardy assessment for back taxes based, let's say, on the narcotics transactions that the government has discovered. 
    That would discourage, no doubt, some lawyers from representing the defendant on the theory that they would not be likely to get paid in light of this very high likelihood that the jeopardy assessment would result in tax--

    --It's principally... it's fiscal in this sense. 
    It's fiscal in that the purpose is to strip drug dealers of economic power, and at the same time to deter drug dealers from engaging in drug dealings when they expect, as they have in the past, that whatever penalties they suffer, they will not lose the vast profits that they have been able to accumulate. 
    So, it is deterrence stripping them of their power, and also to collect assets in order to continue the asset forfeiture--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3147.359" stopTime="3156.715">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --But to the extent you talk about stripping the defendant of economic power, that purpose is not defeated if some of the money is spent for legitimate living expenses and attorneys' fees.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Well, it can be in this sense, Your Honor. 
    First of all, he knows that even though he may be subject to forfeiture, that he knows that he can exercise some considerable economic power by hiring whatever lawyer he wants to hire, and he knows also... and this is even--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3173.260" stopTime="3184.382">

    Wells, but we're not talking about sham transactions now. 
    We're talking about hiring reputable counsel who charge normal legal rates or paying normal food bills.

    One way--

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but I... am I right in saying that the desire of the defendant to hire counsel of his or her choice is part of the economic power the government seeks to take away from him?

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Not according to our theory, that's right. 
    Now, the... the... Caplin &amp; Drysdale would say that any creditor whose credit... whose obligations... the obligations to whom arose because of ordinary living expenses would be entitled to collect under the statute. 
    That is not, as I understand it, their Sixth Amendment argument, but they say the statute provides for--

    --That's right, by a statute. 
    I think that would raise... raise serious problems unless there were some good reason, such as Congress deciding there was a serious problem with the narcotics defense bar collecting fees, and they specifically addressed that problem of collecting huge fees under dubious circumstances. 
    There very well might be a statute that would be constitutional if it addressed that problem for that reason. 
    But if it was simply designed in order to skew the balance against the defendant and for no other purpose, then I think there would be a problem.

   Rebuttal of Peter Van N. Lockwood
speaker="peter_van_n_lockwood" startTime="3437.747" stopTime="3542.130">
    Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood 
    Your Honor, counsel for the government has persistently attempted to suggest that the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case is unusual because the... it involves a situation where at the time the defendant was deprived of the ability to pay his lawyer, the government had proven or had a high degree of certainty that the assets were forfeitable. 
    That is simply not the case. 
    What is the case is that it was proven after the services were rendered that the assets were forfeitable by consent. 
    But if you... if you posited that Caplin &amp; Drysdale had been paid as it went along, because there was no restraining order, then we would not have received any money prior to the time of the... at which the government knew to be forfeitable or the court knew to be forfeitable. 
    But under 853(c), the relation-back doctrine, the... the government would be here arguing we would have to give it back. 
    The question, therefore, is... is... is whether or not the fact that Caplin &amp; Drysdale, as part of its ethical obligation to its client, agreed to proceed forward and represent him without having been paid, should now be penalized for having done so or, alternatively, should have given into a conflict of interest and said to the defendant don't plead guilty on March the 14th. 
    We've got a hearing on March 15th on our fees. 
    We want to make sure we get paid first. 
    And maybe the government will withdraw the guilty plea offer if we don't take it today, but that's not really very important because it's more important that we get paid. 
    That is, it seems to me, an extremely harsh and unjustified rule to try and single out Caplin &amp; Drysdale from all other lawyers that could come in here and make an argument--
