    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The second case is Mesa versus California number 87-1206 which comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    In the summer of 1985, the petitioners Mesa and Ebrahim were employed as mail truck drivers by the US Postal Service in Santa Clara County, California. 
    In unrelated incidence, the State of California issued complaints against the petitioners for criminal traffic violations that occurred while the petitioners were driving the mail trucks. 
    They were arraigned in State Court. 
    Through the offices of the US attorney for the Northern District of California, the petitioners Sought to remove these prosecutions in State Court. 
    The Federal District Court, pursuant to Section 1442(a) of the Judicial Code which permits removal of any similar criminal prosecution brought against a federal officer in State Court for any act done under color of office. 
    The basis for the removal of petition was that the traffic violations had occurred while petitioners were on duty. 
    Federal District Court granted the removal of petitions, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a writ of mandamus ordering the District Court to remand the prosecutions to the California State Courts. 
    On the ground that petitioners had failed to raise a colorable federal defense. 
    We granted the petition to serve to resolve a conflict among the Circuits concerning the necessary predicate for federal officer removal under Section 1442. 
    We now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals unanimously. 
    For reasons explained in the opinion, we decline to depart from a long line of this Court's precedents dating the 1868 that requires federal officer removal under the statute to be predicated upon the assertion of a federal defense. 
    And this interpretation avoids potential difficulties under Article 3 of the constitution that might arise if we were to adopt petitioner's contrary review. 
    Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Marshall has joined.
