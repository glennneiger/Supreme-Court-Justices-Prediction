    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 87-6571, Dethorne Graham v. M. S. Connor. 
    Mr. Beaver, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="12.241" stopTime="134.520">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court: 
    On November 12, 1984, Dethorne Graham was not a convict or a criminal. 
    He was not a pretrial detainee. 
    Indeed, he was not even a formal arrestee. 
    He was a free citizen of the United States of America who on that day had an insulin reaction, and he called upon a friend to take him to a convenience store where he could purchase some orange juice to help counteract the effect of the insulin reaction. 
    Upon arriving there, he noted that because of a line it would take him a long time to get his orange juice, and he became concerned and ran to his friend's car and motioned for him to take him to his girlfriend's house. 
    A Charlotte, North Carolina police officer saw him hurriedly exit the convenience store and determined the conditions to be suspicious enough to allow for a brief investigative stop to determine the facts. 
    Upon making this stop, Mr. Berry immediately informed Officer Connor that Mr. Graham was indeed suffering from what he described as a sugar reaction. 
    At this time Officer Connor asked Mr. Berry, or told Mr. Berry, that he must remain with Mr. Graham at that time while he determined what happened at the convenience store, and he began to depart. 
    At this time the Petitioner became concerned, and according to his testimony he has little memory of what occurred, most likely because of the continuation of his insulin reaction. 
    He exited the car and ran around it twice, and then sat down on the curb. 
    From this point forward, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Petitioner, as must be done on a directed verdict, he was seated at that time, again peacefully talking with the police officers when back-up officers arrived. 
    We know that those officers must have been told of the alleged sugar reaction before the first comment.

    To whom was he talking?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="149.696" stopTime="298.874">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    He was talking to Mr. Berry and to Officer Connor at that time, when the back-up officers arrived, and we can tell by the comment of the first arriving officer that they were explained about the sugar reaction because the first comment was, 
    "I've seen a lot of people with sugar diabetes before but none that ever acted like this. " 
    "There must be... he must be drunk. " 
    "Let's lock him up. " 
    And they grabbed him, and they turned him over and they handcuffed him very tightly, so tightly that at the conclusion of this episode he had cut wrists; and they lifted him up by his arms and they carried him to the hood of Mr. Berry's car and laid him over it. 
    At this time, he regained his senses and began to talk with the officers and complain about the treatment he was receiving, and he asked them to please check his back pocket for his diabetic decal to show that he was indeed a diabetic. 
    The response was, an officer told him to shut up and slammed his head into the hood of the police car... or, I'm sorry, Mr. Berry's car. 
    A few moments later, no less than four police officers grabbed Mr. Graham, one on each arm, one on each leg, picked him physically off the ground, carried him to a police car, opened the back door and threw him in, to use the Petitioner's words, like he was a sack of potatoes, and they drove him home... never arrested him. 
    When he arrived home they unhandcuffed him and he fell flat on the ground, and he was carried within a few moments for medical attention and the examining physician discovered he had a broken foot. 
    He in fact had an insulin reaction. 
    His blood sugar count was very low; and they discovered that he had cut wrists and he had a large abrasion over his right eye. 
    He had an injured right shoulder that prohibited him to the extent that for two weeks he could not administer his own insulin shots. 
    He missed five and a half weeks of work at the North Carolina Department of Transportation. 
    He incurred medical expenses. 
    All as a result of this. 
    On these facts, the lower courts on a directed verdict held that these acts by the police officers had violated no constitutional right of Mr. Graham to be free from bodily harm and physical abuse at the hands of law enforcement officers. 
    May it please the Court, this decision is wrong, and it is wrong for four reasons. 
    Initially it is wrong because it fails to understand that whenever force--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now what court decision are you talking about?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="302.160" stopTime="306.797">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    --I'm talking about the District Court decision and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="306.797" stopTime="308.464">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We're reviewing the Court of Appeals decision.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="308.464" stopTime="309.564">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    We are, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="309.564" stopTime="313.218">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What did it hold?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="313.218" stopTime="342.137">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    The 4th Circuit United States Court of Appeals, we contend, created a generic hybrid type of constitutional right with no specific provision as to what the constitutional anchor for the analysis is. 
    They permitted the consideration of the subjective intent of the officers when it is our contention that two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence of this Court forbids such an analysis.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="342.137" stopTime="344.570">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you're saying they applied the wrong rule of law.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="344.570" stopTime="582.093">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Yes, sir. 
    They are wrong because they failed to understand that whenever force is used by officers to seize a citizen, the 4th Amendment, by its very own terms preventing, or prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure, controls analysis. 
    The decision is wrong because it fails to apply the principles that were laid down by this Court in Tennessee v. Garner, an objective standard of reasonableness test to analyze this situation. 
    It was wrong because it suggests contrary to two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence, beginning in 1967 with this Court's decision in the Schmarber case, that at a minimum the 4th Circuit held that it was relevant to consider, at a minimum that it was relevant to consider, not only was the officer's conduct unreasonable, but whether the officer inflicted pain on the citizen maliciously, sadistically, for the very purpose of causing harm. 
    The 4th Amendment forbids that, Tennessee v. Garner and Terry v. Ohio tell us. 
    And finally, the decision was wrong because the court below erred as a matter of law in resolving credibility issues, weighing testimony, determining credibility in the light not most favorable to the Petitioner and drawing unfavorable inferences in deciding and affirming its directed verdict. 
    Initially, all parties in briefs concede that the Petitioner was seized in this case, when Officer Connor informed the Petitioner and Berry that they were not free to leave. 
    However, the inquiry was not stopped there, for we are told in Terry v. Ohio that a seizure which is reasonable at its inception may violate the 4th amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope. 
    To quote this court in Tennessee v. Garner, reasonableness depends not only when a seizure is made, but also how it is carried out. 
    Tennessee v. Garner relied upon two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence of this court and analyzed an officer's use of force in seizing a suspect from an objective standard of reasonableness. 
    May it please the Court, Tennessee v. Garner logically controls the disposition of this claim just as Terry and its progeny controls the framework of Tennessee v. Garner. 
    Inexplicably, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal fails to even cite or mention Tennessee v. Garner or the objective standard of reasonableness and instead embarks upon a determination of the Petitioner's claim based upon a substantive due process concept which was first formulated by the 2nd Circuit in its 1973 decision in Johnson v. Glick. 
    In Glick, relying upon this Court's 1952 decision in Rochin v. California, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held that the due process clause protects criminal suspects from police conduct that shocks the conscience. 
    But of course, Rochin, the analytical predecessor of Glick, predated Mapp v. Ohio, and at that time, at the time Rochin was decided the 4th Amendment was not a part of the Constitution made applicable to the states. 
    Nonetheless, Judge Friendly announced four tests to be used in analyzing this'shock the conscience' test, the fourth of which was a wholly subjective factor of whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm. 
    These factors have since been used by a number of Circuits including the one below to analyze excessive force claims. 
    However, we submit that the continued use of this substantive Glick test, and particularly its fourth factor, in seizure and arrest cases, is patently at odds with the express words of the 4th Amendment and the holdings of this Court. 
    And that is for four reasons.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="582.093" stopTime="590.849">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Beaver, don't you understand that your opponents here concede that the 4th Amendment is the correct mode of analysis for these facts?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="590.849" stopTime="663.711">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    I understand that they do so in their brief, sir. 
    Yes, sir, I do that. 
    But what they do not concede is that... they would have this Court believe, and the 4th Circuit would hold, that its decision which relied upon the four Glick factors and discussed the four Glick factors, it would have us believe that that is simply another way of stating objective standard of reasonableness, and it is not. 
    Objective standard of reasonableness forbids, strictly forbids a look at subjective intent, and the reason for this is it is irrelevant. 
    It is irrelevant to an objective 4th Amendment consideration. 
    Two examples: Tennessee v. Garner is a prime example of why it is irrelevant. 
    In that case, clearly a majority of this Court held that the conduct engaged upon by the officers was objectively unreasonable. 
    However, this Court... the Courts below when it was never raised, the officer there clearly acted with a benign intent. 
    He was not in any way malicious or sadistic or acting for the purposes of--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="663.711" stopTime="671.051">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But does the subjective factor have any bearing on any immunity that the officers might have?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="671.051" stopTime="680.340">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    --It does not under this Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald where a subjective... this Court has driven subjective considerations from every aspect of 4th Amendment analysis.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="680.340" stopTime="691.230">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So under your view, I take it, the immunity analysis collapses into the objective analysis under the 4th Amendment and the issue is simply the same?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="691.230" stopTime="704.355">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Oh, no. 
    They are simply not the same. 
    Tennessee v. Garner is a prime example of why it's not the same. 
    Tennessee v. Garner, the conduct was held clearly to be objectively unreasonable at the same time it was held to be within qualified good faith--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="704.355" stopTime="706.740">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    There there was reliance, because of reliance on a statute?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="706.740" stopTime="709.026">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    --Because of reliance upon the Bright Line test--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="709.026" stopTime="715.830">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In this case... in this case, are the two inquiries precisely the same?
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="715.830" stopTime="754.205">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    --I would think not, but with all due respect there was no raising of the qualified good faith immunity defense in this case. 
    It was never presented either by pleadings or in argument before the District Court or before the Appellate Court. 
    It was never raised. 
    It's simply not an issue in the matter. 
    Hypothetically, I can see no reason why this case would be any different with Tennessee v. Garner. 
    I think it clearly violates... can be argued clearly that it violates Bright Lyon standards to take a handcuffed man who merely asked you to look into his diabetic decal, grab him on the back of the head and slam his head into the hood of a car.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="754.205" stopTime="774.516">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Counsel, under the objective approach, or test, that you propose, I assume that statements made by the officers during the course of the arrest that might indicate personal animus would be irrelevant.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="774.516" stopTime="822.932">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Yes. 
    And my I explain... or may I take one little caveat to that. 
    I recall your Footnote 13, I believe it was in United States v. Scott, in which you were talking about... this is the case involving the wire taps... in which you indicated that perhaps such bad faith statements could be usable by the Court in the criminal context, for example, to determine whether the exclusionary rule should apply. 
    It can also be used in the civil context to look into credibility issues for jury determination if the officer is acting objectively malicious by his statements. 
    Clearly a jury can consider that in determining the credibility of him taking the stand and saying that things occurred in a different way. 
    And finally, in a civil context it's also useful for punitive damages questions.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="822.932" stopTime="827.067">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    then. 
    it would appear that the officer's statements would have no relevance.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="827.067" stopTime="831.538">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Other than perhaps in a decision by the jury whether to award punitive damages.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="831.538" stopTime="858.272">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Some of the circuits have applied a pretextual seizure doctrine. 
    For instance, a traffic arrest is made, and it may be unreasonable even though the officer had probable cause, if in fact the officer was trying to make a drug arrest, for example. 
    There are cases involving pretextual seizures.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="858.272" stopTime="859.155">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    I see.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="859.155" stopTime="865.609">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think your objective standard would preclude that kind of an analysis?

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    I believe that a pretextual stop is not objectively reasonable, if that makes sense. 
    To arrest someone and seize them on a pretext I think from an objective point of view can be argued is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="884.404" stopTime="891.057">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Well, I might not. 
    It depends on who my client is, Your Honor. 
    Assuming, then, that the 4th Amendment applies, the Court below erred in considering either as an element of the Petitioner's claim or as a conceptual factor, however that is defined by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the subjective intent of the officers. 
    First of all, Section 1983 this Court has on numerous occasions has held contains no state of mind requirement, and one must focus on the specific constitutional amendment itself. 
    As this Court has held in Tennessee v. Garner and in Terry v. Ohio and other earlier cases, the 4th Amendment calls for this objective standard. 
    The 4th Amendment does not prohibit malicious and sadistic seizures or seizures that are accompanied by severe injury. 
    It prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and as I stated I believe firmly that the subjective intent of the officers in making a seizure is a wholly irrelevant factor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1099.818" stopTime="1103.936">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Wouldn't the officer at least have to intend to seize the person.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="1103.936" stopTime="1190.139">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Yes. 
    Under... this sounds as if Your Honor is asking whether there must be an intentional act to predicate this test, and we certainly are willing to concede that this case does not imply anything about unintended acts creating unintended injuries. 
    This case is no more involved with that type of situation than Tennessee v. Garner was. 
    I believe that what the 4th Circuit opinion does, we mentioned a moment ago, or I mentioned the hybrid test which is not specifically set to any particular constitutional amendment. 
    Yet if you tell a jury, in instructing the jury, that they should consider the subjective intent of an officer, you're going to end up with many jury verdicts in which the jury says well, the person was not being malicious or sadistic therefore we should not find against him. 
    As mentioned earlier, this Court has driven subjective considerations even from the good faith defense. 
    It goes even further in the last term in Michigan v. Chesternut, this Court drove the any subjective intent requirements out of the decision as to whether or not a person felt that he was seized. 
    The Court held in Michigan v. Chesternut that a person is seized when he, when an objective person, when a reasonable person under the circumstances would not feel that he was wrong.

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    No, not in every case. 
    Personally I've tried two cases in which a Court has told the jury if they find it in the way that the Plaintiff has contended things occurred they would find for the Plaintiff. 
    If they found it in the way the defense said... there are some cases which are clear. 
    There are other cases which it is a jury question, when they have to resolve conflicts.

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    In my opinion, in this case, were there no other side to be heard, yes, under an objective reasonableness test. 
    You don't even treat arrestees like this. 
    This is a Terry stop that got out of control, as a matter of law, without hearing from the other side. 
    But there is another side to be heard. 
    We are not asking this Court to direct the verdict in our favor. 
    Clearly, clearly they have the opportunity to present their evidence and to make their arguments. 
    The problem with this case is that the 4th Circuit opinion, and I repeat, allows... at least allows, if not requires... the consideration of subjective intent. 
    The 4th Amendment forbids it.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    We think Petitioner has misunderstood the Court of Appeals decision in this case. 
    That decision does not implicate the question the Petitioner has asked this Court to decide. 
    The question presented and briefed and argued today by Petitioner is whether excessive force claims under the 4th Amendment and Section 1983 are governed by a subjective test. 
    Now, let me note that the Petitioner himself concedes in his brief that he never focused his claim on the 4th Amendment either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals. 
    Indeed, his complaint nowhere refers to the 4th Amendment, even though it was filed some approximately four months after Garner was decided. 
    And today, Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals for not referring to either Terry or Garner in its opinion, out I note that his brief in the Court of Appeals cited neither of those cases.

speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1438.081" stopTime="1466.848">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    It certainly could have. 
    But we don't think this case presents the question the Petitioner seeks to raise in this Court, for the decisions and the judgments below do not depend upon the application of a subjective test, and I say that for two reasons. 
    First, the phrase "maliciously and sadistically" does not, as Petitioner believes, refer to the actual subjective intent of the officers. 
    Indeed, at the trial here, no one ever suggested that subjective intent was an element.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1466.848" stopTime="1473.252">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Let me interrupt you for just a moment. 
    Do you agree that this case should be decided under 4th Amendment principles?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1473.252" stopTime="1475.438">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    We agree that it can be analyzed under the 4th Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1475.438" stopTime="1476.188">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And should be?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1476.188" stopTime="1544.082">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Yes, we would agree with that. 
    I think there are some cases I should add, and this one may be debatable, that could be decided under the 5th Amendment standard. 
    The test proposed by Petitioner is that the 4th Amendment seizure continue so long as the arrestee is in the company of the arresting officers, which could continue after bail has been set and the person bound over in the local jail. 
    So we think that test goes very far, but on these facts as we've got them today we don't object to the application of a 4th Amendment analysis. 
    But as I was saying, the trial in this case, no one ever suggested that subjective malice was an element of Petitioner's cause of action, and Petitioner never even attempted to prove the subjective intent of the officers. 
    Now the 4th Circuit itself explained in this case that 
    "concepts such as malicious and sadistic should be understood as descriptions of the degrees of force that exceed the state's privilege and thereby implicate intrusions into constitutionally protected personal security. " 
    The en banc 4th Circuit offered the same explanation in its subsequent opinion in Justice against Dennis, which was rendered prior to the filing of the petition in this case.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is this on the theory that words mean precisely what we intend them to mean and nothing else? 
    That's a very strange way to use those words, isn't it?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1550.669" stopTime="1564.246">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    No. 
    It was an attempt by the Court of Appeals to define that level of force that constitutes a constitutional violation. 
    It is not the subjective intent of the officers. 
    A malice standard in law is often an objective standard, and under the 4th--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1564.245" stopTime="1568.047">

    For example?

speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1573.815" stopTime="1583.807">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I believe that's right. 
    Malice can be inferred from the objective circumstances, and the Court said as much in this case and in its--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1583.807" stopTime="1603.201">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The inference is of intent. 
    I mean, the normal meaning of those terms is addressed to the intent of the actor, and there may be objective circumstances that give rise to an inference, but I think the normal use would indicate subjective intent.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1603.201" stopTime="1605.303">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    --They could be used in that way, but the Court of Appeals--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1605.303" stopTime="1629.935">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    They would normally be used that way, and I don't know that I can read the Court of Appeals language as imposing some objective standard out there by the use of those words. 
    It looked very much like they were kind of adopting a sort of Whitley v. Albers standard for review of what occurred here.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1629.935" stopTime="1683.422">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    --We read the Court of Appeals decision in this case and in Justice subsequent en banc decision to explain that it was an objective test: that it's a legal description of that level of force that is more than simply a battery under state law and reaches the level of a constitutional violation. 
    So it is not an objective... I mean, it is not a subjective standard that looks to the intent of the jury. 
    Now, it may well be that other words could be better chosen to accomplish that, but we think the Court of Appeals has sufficiently explained itself. 
    But let me say, equally important, even if the Court of Appeals did think that in general a subjective test was appropriate here, the decisions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case did not turn in any way on any subjective standard. 
    Rather, both Courts held the Respondent's conduct was objectively reasonable considering the need for force, the amount of force used and the extent of the injuries that Petitioner has alleged.

    I believe it was by his friend who had brought the orange juice. 
    But the police didn't interfere with his getting the orange juice at that point. 
    He was freed. 
    They removed him from the scene not because they were arresting him but because a crowd had gathered and was getting out of hand, and so they decided to remove him. 
    But the conclusion that his medical problem wasn't urgent and could be deferred until he was secured and removed from this hostile scene seems to us to be reasonable, in light of his own statements refusing medical assistance and saying he didn't need to go to the hospital. 
    In view of his physical resistance; in view of the crowd that was gathering.

    He was resisting. 
    Even after he was handcuffed, Justice Marshall, the undisputed evidence is that he was kicking and fighting, resisting getting into the car. 
    The officers were entitled to use force to overcome his resistance, even if it meant, as he characterizes it, throwing him into the car. 
    The evidence is that two or three officers stood on one side and pushed him in the door. 
    One officer took his arm from the other side and pulled him through. 
    That was what he characterizes as throwing him in the car. 
    Given his resistance, even after he was handcuffed, and given the crowd that was gathering and getting out of hand the police were reasonable in deciding that they needed force to overcome his resistance and that they needed to get him into the car quickly and out of the hostile environment.

speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="2425.561" stopTime="2499.892">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I think the Court should decide it. 
    I think it would provide helpful guidance to lower Courts if the Court not only enunciated the standard but applied it here. 
    The record in this case is about 100 pages long. 
    It's really quite short. 
    Unfortunately, some important material is not contained in the joint appendix, but I would urge the Court to read the record if it decides to undertake the question of whether the directed verdict in this case was appropriately entered. 
    But to follow up on your question, justice White, even if you think the 4th Circuit's general standard is one of subjective intent, the basis for the holding in this case was not subjective. 
    Both of the decisions below turn on the determination that the officers acted with objective reasonableness in the circumstances of this case. 
    The Court of Appeals itself said that a directed verdict was proper because 
    "the evidence clearly establishes that at each stage of the incident the actions of the officers were essentially reasonable. " 
    The Court of Appeals did not rule for Respondents here on the theory that they had not acted maliciously and sadistically in using unreasonable force. 
    Instead, it held that looking to the need for an amount of force here, the use of force simply could not have been found to be unreasonable in the circumstances of this case. 
    That's the objective standard the Petitioner advocates.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Levy, I hate to keep interrupting you, but I think there is a lot in the opinion that supports your argument that the Court was basically applying an objective standard. 
    But the one comment that I wish you'd comment on is the second paragraph of Footnote 3, when the Court points out that they don't think there should be a conceptual difference between 8th Amendment standard and the 4th Amendment standard. 
    I read that as the Court of Appeals applying the equivalent of an 8th Amendment standard in a 4th Amendment context.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="2526.443" stopTime="2540.803">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Let me give two answers. 
    First, at most that would go to the question of what the Court of Appeals thinks the general standard is, not necessarily what it was applying in this case. 
    But beyond that, it's not so clear to me that the 8th Amendment standard under Whitley isn't a subjective standard.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2540.803" stopTime="2550.392">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Oh, I agree one can read that as also an objective standard, but it's a much more severe, it's a different standard than the 4th Amendment standard, or is it? 
    Do you think it is?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="2550.392" stopTime="2561.866">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    It's different in its words, and maybe at the margin it's different. 
    It's hard to know exactly, and we don't necessarily propose that the Court adopt the same words as the 4th Amendment standard here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2561.866" stopTime="2571.488">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the Court of Appeals seems to have applied a standard that would be the same standard in an 8th Amendment context. 
    That's what I'm saying. 
    And if you don't urge that, then it seems to me that you are not defending the Court of Appeals rationale.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="2571.488" stopTime="2583.380">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    No, I think the Court of Appeals decision is defensible, although as we discussed before its language may be a little bit ill-chosen to convey the sense of an objective test. 
    We think that's what they were doing, and maybe more precise language would be useful.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2583.380" stopTime="2590.802">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I'm not making the objective subject dichotomy, but just saying that theirs is a more severe objective test than the proper objective test would be.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="2590.802" stopTime="2959.091">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I think the problem in this case, or in Whitley against Albers, or in Garner, is to formulate a constitutional standard that allows... that accommodates the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to use force on the one hand, but doesn't allow them to use force that is simply gratuitous or unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement need. 
    The problem is basically the same in those two areas. 
    Now it may be that taking the context into account, the law enforcement officials can do different things in those two areas in balancing the two competing considerations, but the underlying problem is very much the same. 
    An example may help to illustrate that. 
    If the prison riot that occurred in Whitley had occurred at a pretrial detention center like the MCC in New York, the 8th Amendment wouldn't have applied because those people hadn't yet been convicted of a crime. 
    And yet riot in a jail, it seems to me, could be handled in precisely the same way that the riot in Whitley was handled. 
    The fact that the jail situation would be analyzed under Bell against Wolfish and 5th Amendment substantive due process terms, whereas the Whitley situation was analyzed in 8th Amendment terms, doesn't really change very much, if at all, the real issue that's before the Courts in dealing with these kinds of problems. 
    And similarly, in the 4th Amendment area, the question again is what is a reasonable range of choice for police officers in carrying out their duties. 
    Now, the test we would propose... and it differs in language but I don't think in philosophy from the Court of Appeals... is this: force is unreasonable under the 4th Amendment if it is clearly excessive, such that no reasonably competent police officer could have thought it appropriate because it was arbitrary in relation to any legitimate law enforcement need. 
    In other words, so long as the use of force was debatable and within the range of judgment of reasonable police officers, it is not a federal constitutional tort. 
    And we think that is in sum and substance very much what the Court of Appeals was getting at in this case. 
    It was trying to determine, through the malicious and sadistic standard, when the use of force was appropriate for a law enforcement need on the one hand, or when it wasn't. 
    When it was simply being used, to quote the language, maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of inflicting harm. 
    We think that was the issue the Court was grappling with, and its standard drew the line in that place. 
    Now, let me talk a little bit more about the general 4th Amendment standard. 
    We don't disagree that this case can be analyzed in 4th Amendment terms. 
    We don't disagree that the 4th Amendment establishes an objective reasonableness test judged in the light of the totality of the circumstances as they appeared to the officers at the time. 
    And indeed, the 4th Circuit itself recently applied an objective reasonableness standard under the 4th Amendment in a recent decision called Martin v. Gentile, which is reported in 849 F. 2c. 
    We do, though, strongly disagree with the way in which Petitioner proposes that the 4th Amendment test be understood and implemented. 
    Now, it is axiomatic, we think, that the use of force is a necessary and unavoidable part of police work, including arrests and stops. 
    As the North Carolina amicus brief explains, police daily confront dangerous, often violent situations that require split-second judgments on the scene, in difficult, uncertain and fast-changing circumstances that pose serious risks and injury or even death to the police officers and others. 
    It should be recognized that there is a range of actions that would be reasonable for the police to take in light of their appraisal on the scene, on the spot of the ambiguous and changing circumstances as they see them. 
    It's important that not every state battery claim against the police official be converted into a federal lawsuit under Section 1983. 
    Not every battery becomes a federal constitutional case simply because the defendant is a police officer. 
    In judging the actions of the police officers it is also important that they not be... not be looked at in hindsight in the calm of the courtroom to determine whether the officers acted in the best possible way, or whether they used no more force than we can now see was absolutely necessary in the circumstances. 
    And that's basically what Petitioner's test proposes. 
    His standard is the hypothetical reasonable police officer. 
    The force is excessive if the hypothetical police officer would not have thought that it was reasonably required and necessary in the circumstances, and that language... reasonably required and necessary... is contained in Petitioner's brief on pages 25 and 36. 
    Now, Petitioner of course pays lip service to the concerns that I raise, but it's clear from the way he would apply his test in this case that he doesn't really mean them. 
    His test would enshrine the Restatement of Torts in the Constitution, and would convert every battery case against the police officer under state law into a federal cause of action. 
    I read his brief, I've listened to his argument, and he proposes no principle... no basis... for saying that some battery actions fall only under state law and distinguishing those that he says would be a federal constitutional case. 
    Every such arrest that involves the use of force is a potential federal civil rights case under his proposed test. 
    Every claim that the police officers used more force than was necessary... that is, they were appropriately using some force, but simply used more than they reasonably should have, would state a federal cause of action. 
    Every contention that a suspect was thrown a little bit too hard against a wall, or that an officer's grip on a suspect was a little too hard--

    He was acting erratically, he was physically resisting the officers. 
    We think his treatment here was not a constitutional violation in any respect. 
    Now, there's one part of Petitioner's test that I'd like to comment on specifically. 
    As the Solicitor General's brief makes clear, Petitioner's test calls for a comparison between the police officer's conduct and any less forcible alternatives that they might have used in the circumstances. 
    That's a least drastic means test, and we think it's wholly out of place in this context and inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Whitley against Albers, in Bell against Wolfish and most particularly in Martinez Fuerte, which was itself a 4th Amendment case. 
    A reasonable governmental action does not become unreasonable simply because the police did not take the best possible option. 
    At least so long as the choices were within the ranges of debatable alternatives, the fact that the best one is not selected does not render the choice made unconstitutional. 
    Another problem with the Petitioner's least drastic means approach is that it practically invites the jury to second-guess the actions of the police officers and to substitute its judgment for theirs as to what should have happened.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    It could be characterized that way. 
    It does draw on that, as well as the 4th Amendment notion of reasonableness, but we think that really is the core inquiry here. 
    When is it reasonable, when is it rational for police to use the force that they did in the way that they did, or when was it unrelated to some legitimate law enforcement need? 
    And I don't know that juries are going to be very good at making that determination. 
    They're going to be presented with alternatives by Plaintiff's expert witness at trial. 
    They're going to be deliberating this in the calm hindsight of the courtroom, and it's going to be all too easy for them to conclude that it would have been better for the police to have acted differently, and that should not be the constitutional standard and it should not be left to the juries to decide.

    Well, but you're conflating the 4th Amendment test with a test for official immunity. 
    I mean, we could adopt a tighter test for the 4th Amendment. 
    That is the test that your opponent explicitly espouses. 
    Was it more force than was necessary, period. 
    If it was, it's a 4th Amendment violation. 
    Whether the policeman is liable for it, on the other hand, would depend upon whether a reasonable policeman could have believed that he was using no more than was necessary. 
    The issue of immunity is quite different from the issue of whether there has been a 4th Amendment violation.

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Well, the application of immunity doctrine here is not at all clear. 
    In some respects, it's like Anderson against Creighton, and we think whatever the standard is, there would be room for an immunity defense. 
    But in Whitley against Albers and in Daniel; against Williams, the Court didn't refrain to decide the liability issue because there might be an immunity defense. 
    Liability is the logically antecedent question and there are reasons why the Court shouldn't want all its bases.

    Mr. Beaver, do you have any rebuttal? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of H. Gerald Beaver

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    Very briefly, if I might, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, again may it please the Court. 
    Speaking of this hostile environment. 
    It was not a hostile environment to my client. 
    He was amongst friends. 
    It was hostile, perhaps, to the police officers who were abusing him. 
    The point I'm getting at is, I don't believe the police can create their own exigency and then complain that they had to use force against someone to get themselves out of the exigency that they have created by their own objectively unreasonable behavior.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the Court of Appeals said that it was undisputed that really the evidence showed that your client was being very active sitting on the curb, and that he was having to be restrained by his friend and an officer.

    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    If I may, sir, get fact-specific, Justice: under the case in the direct examination of Mr. Berry, he was directly asked whether at any time he saw the Petitioner kicking or waving his arms around or resisting in any way. 
    He stated he was there throughout the entire transaction and at no time did this occur. 
    He did state on cross-examination that on a time or two the Petitioner protested against his treatment and pulled his arms away.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3234.051" stopTime="3238.419">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There was testimony that he tried to kick an officer.
speaker="h_gerald_beaver" startTime="3238.419" stopTime="3467.653">
    Mr. H. Gerald Beaver 
    There was testimony from another police officer that he did that, but we are not bound by the credibility of a police officer that we call for adverse examination under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Your Honor. 
    We've heard these cries of wolf, that if such a standard were to be adopted the floodgates would be let down, before. 
    But to be quite candid, there are a mountain of problems bringing cases such as this. 
    The Monell doctrine prohibits bringing other than the most egregious, clearest policy, practice and procedure cases against municipalities. 
    Qualified good faith immunity protects officers much as Justice Scalia has just correctly discussed. 
    It is easy to confuse the objective standard of reasonableness and qualified good faith immunity. 
    It is a substantial protection for police officers who act with objective good faith in their activities. 
    The Detura decision issued by this Court two years ago, which prohibited the awarding of substantial damages on the basis of violation of constitutional rights alone without any regard whatsoever for physical injury, would certainly deter the bringing of most de minimus lawsuits. 
    And having practiced in the United States District Courts in these type of cases, may I say we are acutely aware of the requirements of Rule 11, and we are going to be absolutely certain of our cases before they are pled and they are brought. 
    Turning to the facts of this case, again I believe that my opponent continues to misjudge the standard of evidence in the light most favorable to the Petitioner. 
    He states that our own expert testified that the seizure was appropriate, but if you will look closely at the record you will find that this testimony occurred during a voir dire hearing, if I'm correct, as to his expertise in which he was posed a hypothetical question which he did not posit with any and all of the facts subsequently brought into the case. 
    And at another time, when presented another hypothetical case, with all the... hypothetical question... with all the pertinent factors in, stated that in his opinion the seizure of the Petitioner was improper. 
    My opponent in this matter would have this Court imply or approve an objective standard of reasonableness but something else test. 
    That something else, we don't know exactly what it is. 
    It's somewhere between the 8th Amendment requirement and the objective standard of reasonableness. 
    This Court clearly has never applied subjective factors such as here, except in the Albers situation. 
    That case has been recently, and that decision... that malicious and sadistic, an intent to harm... has been recently reaffirmed by this Court no later today, and the decision to deny certiorari in the case of Dudley v. Stubbs. 
    There Justice O'Connor, even for speaking in dissent, for the three Justices in dissent, clearly recognizes there that there is a distinction between the willful indifference test in the nonriot situation and the substantive condition in the prison riot situation. 
    The only purposes of the dissent is to say in that factual circumstance the dissenters feel that sufficient evidence was presented of a prison riot-type situation. 
    There is absolutely no reason, as Judge Butzner says in his dissent, and this Court has never at any time even hinted, that the substantial wall against liability created in cases involving convicted prisoners should be applied to free and innocent citizens. 
    We ask you not to apply such a standard.
