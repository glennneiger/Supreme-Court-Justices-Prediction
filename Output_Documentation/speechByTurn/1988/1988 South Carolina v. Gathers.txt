South Carolina v. Gathers

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 88-305, South Carolina v. Demetrius Gathers. 
    Mr. Zelenka, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Donald John Zelenka 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents an opportunity for the Court to revisit the role of the victim in capital sentencing proceedings and prevent further eroding of that role in the criminal justice equation of punishment. 
    Particularly this case presents the narrow issue of whether the prosecutor's argument during the sentencing phase violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution when it focuses on the characteristics of the victim, as well as the defendant, rather than only the defendant when the characteristics are directly drawn from the evidence admitted at the trial and obvious to the jury. 
    In September 1986, Richard Haynes, a 32 year old black male, was brutally beaten, his possessions ransacked. 
    He was sexually assaulted and murdered by Demetrius Gathers and his accomplices. 
    The beatings occurred at a city park when Hayres had gone to review religious materials that he had set out on the park bench when he was accosted for the first time in reckless disregard of his rights to free expression in practicing his religion. 
    In the sentencing phase, the prosecutor commented upon evidence that was admitted to the trial obvious to the jury from the guilt phase the victim was a religious person, that he was a registered voter, and he read from a prayer card in evidence referred to as the Game Guy's Prayer about a person wanting a fair chance in life and giving others that same fair chance. 
    The Supreme Court of South Carolina, relying on this Court's decision in Booth, asserted that these comments on the personal characteristics of the defendant were not necessary for an understanding of the crime, and therefore violated the Eighth Amendment. 
    We submit that the Eighth Amendment was not violated by these prosecutor's comments and that the Eighth Amendment allows a jury in any capital punishment situation to have an understanding as to who the victim was and what he was doing at the time he was brutally murdered. 
    The Eighth Amendment, we submit, does not preclude comments that are directly related. 
    Yes, sir?

    It wasn't until the Supreme Court in this particular decision, when it noted accord with... with Gaskins, that they asserted possibly that that information could not be admissible. 
    However, the particular situation was not raised in this case. 
    They never sought to challenge that. 
    In fact, the defense counsel endorsed it in his closing argument. 
    He utilized religion as a sense of mitigation and utilized this defendant's particular characteristics for religion and for his Christian faith should be something that should cause there to be mitigation in the minds of the jury generally. 
    In the guilt phase, he argued essentially that perceived mental illness on the part of the victim was something that the jury should consider and acknowledge. 
    The defense counsel, we submit, also and more fluently presented the situation as to religion as to whether that should be a factor the jury should consider. 
    And they tried to utilize that in mitigation of this particular case.

    Mr. Donald John Zelenka 
    --Well, it does let you consider who a victim is we submit in any particular case in the same way as if there are two or three victims in an automobile accident. 
    The defendant might not know how many people are in the car, but the result of it is he is facing more culpability because of what his action did. 
    Similarly, in this case, because he was on a park bench in Charleston, South Carolina was a factor the jury could consider because he thought he would be free from any sort of assault at that time. 
    That is something that the prosecution should allow the jury to consider, and because he was practicing his religion at that time and would not have expected to be accosted in this way, that is something the jury should be allowed to consider in making a decision as to the defendant's particular culpability. 
    The voter registration card, we submit, was merely an analogy that the prosecution tried to use to focus on that Richard Haynes was a living person. 
    At that time he had traits and he had qualities. 
    The defendant in this case, Demetrius Gathers, was not we submit and he was not urged we submit to have received the death penalty because Richard Haynes was a registered voter or because he was a religious person. 
    He was to receive the death penalty because of what he had done to Richard Haynes who was a human being with particular traits.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    This evidence was admitted at the guilt phase. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="donald_john_zelenka" startTime="817.411" stopTime="1065.304">
    Mr. Donald John Zelenka 
    All this evidence was admitted at the guilt phase without objection. 
    It was introduced then into the penalty phase without objection by the defense attorney, and it wasn't until after the prosecution's closing argument that the defense attorney at that time suggested that the prayer card be removed from the... from going to the jury at that particular time. 
    We submit the Eighth Amendment does not require a state to neutralize and redact the victim from the trial where properly admitted evidence reveals personal characteristics of the victim. 
    The evidence, we submit, is relevant to the circumstances of the crime. 
    It's relevant to the information as to the particular moral culpability of the defendant by reflecting upon the person who he chose to kill on that particular date. 
    In capital cases the sentencer's attempt must be to make a unique and individualized judgment regarding the crime and regarding the penalty the defendant deserves. 
    The jury in any capital case is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the appropriate punishment. 
    In this Court's decisions, it's clear that the defendant has virtually free rein to introduce anything in evidence that he considers mitigating to his particular factor. 
    If the defendant, under this Court's decisions, considered certain information to be relevant, its admissibility should be allowed to be introduced. 
    The circumstances of the offense, we submit, must include who the victim was and what he was doing at the time the crime occurred. 
    Here, unlike Booth, the comments did not focus on the reputation of the victim and the effect on his family, but rather on the circumstances of the crime over which the defendant could have had knowledge and control, the apparent selection and choice of a vulnerable victim in September of 1986. 
    To redact this information from the penalty phase would make Richard Haynes a mere abstraction, we submit, and at most this thumbnail sketch was presented of Richard Haynes gave the jury a quick glimpse of the life the defendant chose to extinguish. 
    As the defense can humanize the defendant in any case, we submit the prosecution should equally be able to humanize the victim to allow for correct balance in the criminal justice process and the assessment of the offense from the victim's viewpoint, we submit, is germane to any jury's decision as to the appropriateness of the punishment. 
    In this case concerns that Booth has as to whether this information can be guided were accomplished in this particular setting. 
    During the prosecution's closing argument, the solicitor advised the jury that the sympathy for the victim is not the way you make a determination as to the appropriateness of the punishment. 
    You must focus on the characteristics of the defendant and the circumstances of the particular crime. 
    That is the direction the prosecutor was giving when he made his particular closing argument. 
    Further, the judge, when he gave his jury charge in this case, said that to make your determination, you should refer to the culpability of the defendant in his action involving the death and criminal sexual conduct of the victim, Richard Haynes. 
    The trial judge further charged: you should not be swayed by prejudice, by passion, or by other bias or motive in the particular jury charges. 
    This information gave the jury a guided choice as to the utilization of this information and the determination as to the appropriateness of the penalty in the particular case. 
    The concerns that Booth had of the effect of the murder on the victim's family, again, were not present in this case. 
    The articulation of the members of the victim's family in trying to reflect their collateral suffering that they had as a result of the murder in the case was not presented here. 
    We submit that Booth should not apply to this particular case because--

    Mr. Donald John Zelenka 
    Going that far is probably inconsistent with the first part of Booth. 
    That's correct. 
    But the situation in Booth, the factual situation the Court was presented with, is certainly not the situation we're presenting here to the Court. 
    That evidence went significantly beyond any relevancy that related to the circumstances of the crime or particularly the circumstances of the particular victim in that case. 
    It put them in a vulnerable position. 
    In conclusion, we would submit that the Eighth Amendment does not preclude the types of the comments that were related to the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the defendant in this particular case. 
    The prosecutor was merely attempting to humanize the victim and balance the... the sort of mitigating evidence that was presented in this case dealing with the entire background of the defendant, his relationship with his family members, his ability to be a rock to some family members and to be essentially a nonviolent and friendly person that was presented by those particular family members in this particular case. 
    The vulnerability of the victim was the essence of the argument done this case, that the victim was just a member of society, an individual that had an identity was the attempted argument that the prosecutor was trying to make. 
    The use of this info conveys our common humanity with those who suffer from this sort of crime and keeps us from thinking of them as faceless abstractions. 
    We submit that Richard Haynes, who was brutally murdered in 1986, was a real and a unique person. 
    It is only just that the jury should be permitted to consider that fact in making its determinations.

    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I'd like to draw the Court's attention to page 66... or excuse me... page 17 of the joint appendix concerning the testimony and the lighting. 
    Justice O'Connor, you asked was it likely that Mr. Gathers read this Game Guy's Prayer and the voter registration card prior to his committing these acts. 
    The question was: 
    "What was the lighting like. " 
    "Was it dark? " 
    The answer is: "It was dark out there". 
    So, it's very unlikely, I submit, that this individual stood there and read this card and began to formulate an intent to kill as a result of his knowledge that this man was a Christian and that he was a registered voter. 
    Also, I'd like to point out that in its presentation, the state has conceded that the voter registration card in this case was not relevant to a sentencing determination because it wasn't relevant to the circumstances of the crime or the characteristics of the defendant. 
    And as we'll reach a little bit further in the argument, we would submit that the use of a voter registration card to invoke a death sentence from a sentence... a death sentence from a sentencing authority is a constitutionally impermissible basis for imposing a sentence of death.

    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    Justice Rehnquist, the solicitor argued that these factors... and if you look at this argument in context, the Game Guy's Prayer card... the fact that this man was a Christian and the fact that he was a registered voter who believed in his community and participated in the process, cry out from the grave in support of a sentence of death. 
    That's the way it was couched, and that's the way that evidence was used in this case. 
    And what we're saying is unless the state can demonstrably show in some constitutionally permissible way that those factors were relevant to the commission of this crime and in some way reflect on the characteristic of the defendant that it is a... they are constitutionally impermissible bases--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1437.556" stopTime="1440.758">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What's your authority for that proposition?
speaker="william_isaac_diggs" startTime="1440.758" stopTime="1538.921">
    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    --Well, would cite the Court to the language in Booth v. Maryland itself where this Court cites Zant v. Stephens. 
    And I would rely on Zant v. Stephens for the proposition that constitutionally protected rights and choices, such as religion and politics, cannot have attached to them aggravating labels by a state in a capital sentencing scheme. 
    Now, given that proposition, the... the exact reverse would be true with regard to the victim in the case. 
    And... and I'll explain to you why, because in the United States, you and I all... we all have the right to the... the right to free speech, the right to assemble with other people, and the right to choose or reject a religion. 
    And it would not be permissible, I would submit to you, to have an individual feel or be told that his life somehow has less value to it because he has or she has rejected a particular religion that the solicitor perhaps has accepted. 
    If I go into an unsafe area of a community, I want to feel like I am receiving the full protection of the law as well as other people who may be members of other religions separate and apart from the... the one that I happen to profess or reject. 
    And so, I would submit that religion and politics, constitutionally protected freedom of choice type protections that we have, could never be used as a basis in and of themselves for the imposition of a death sentence.

    Now, the evidence could be admitted. 
    There is certainly evidence in record that not only Mr. Gathers but other people rummaged through this victim's personal belongings. 
    And it's... it's conceded that the Game Guy's Prayer and the voter registration card was there.

    The evidence was properly admitted to show what happened at the... at the criminal assault stage of this case.

    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    --Of course, it can consider it if those handicaps reflect on he characteristic of the defendant. 
    Of course. 
    If it... if it can be demonstrated that the blindness didn't contribute to the... to the offense... for example, suppose you go out and you got a blind child out playing basketball. 
    Some kids come up and they realize that he can't really see that well, and they see his bicycle parked over. 
    And so, he can see well enough that he can avoid running into objects, but he can't really identify people. 
    The individuals kind of sidekick the ball down the hill. 
    And while the child goes to pick it up, they ride off on his bicycle. 
    Now, the blindness of the child, lot of course, can be introduced into... at that point. 
    It becomes relevant to the moral culpability of the defendants. 
    But if that same child were walking down the street and suddenly hit as a car passed by as a result of a random shooter in that car, the shooter... the... the actor shooting that gun, having no knowledge or indication that that child is blind, shoots him and kills him, then the blindness has nothing to do with the circumstances of the crime or the characteristics of the defendant.

    So, if this... if this fellow on the park bench had had a small son with him, that could have come in, but the rest couldn't.
speaker="william_isaac_diggs" startTime="2268.154" stopTime="2395.687">
    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    That's right. 
    Absolutely because it would have been obvious to the defendant. 
    Obviously if you kill a parent that's going to leave a... an orphan child, it goes to the question of culpability. 
    But that... you know, that's not what we have in this case. 
    We have a situation where the victim happened to be in possession of certain items and they happen to relate to religion and to politics, a voter registration card. 
    It... there is an argument in the record that shows that the solicitor utilized those items as a basis is for imposing a sentence of death in the case, and I would submit that's constitutionally impermissible. 
    That's the position of the Respondent. 
    Now, the State of South Carolina can't realize... and I think this goes to a lot of the questions that we've... that I have received in the last few minutes. 
    The State of South Carolina has a common law definition of murder, and it was in effect long before even the Constitution of the United States was adopted here. 
    So, before we ever even had an Eighth Amendment or a Fourteenth Amendment, South Carolina had that... had adopted that common law definition of murder. 
    And through this day even, it remains unchanged, and it's the law of the state now. 
    It was the law of the state at the time Mr. Haynes was killed. 
    And that definition of murder codified by the general assembly, by the legislature in South Carolina, at Title 16 of our code defines murder as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. 
    Now, If you look... if you research the crime of murder in South Carolina, you find a lot of cases that deal with that element of malice aforethought, but you don't find in that same research any cases that deal with the element of human being. 
    And I think this is where the state's case here falls down. 
    Proverbially they can't see the forest for the trees in this case because under South Carolina law now, as it always has, values a human life the same, any human life--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, then you would think the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case would have relied on the principle you're talking about rather than relying on our federal constitutional decision in Booth.
speaker="william_isaac_diggs" startTime="2405.394" stopTime="2432.962">
    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    --Well, basically the law in South Carolina is that a victim's characteristics are irrelevant to a sentencing consideration because all individuals have that same right of protection in South Carolina not to be murdered unlawfully or not to be killed unlawfully. 
    And therefore, the Supreme Court of South Carolina, as has the legislature in... in the state as well, declared that personal characteristics of a victim simply aren't relevant in a sentencing proceeding unless they can be shown to be related--

    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    But the position that the Respondent takes in the case is that because human life is valued equally in South Carolina under this statute, and because the status of the law at the time of this case, as reflected in the adoption of the statute back in 1977, if you look at the aggravating circumstances that the general assembly has adopted which permits... the presence of which permits the state to seek a death penalty, they have nothing to do with victims' characteristics because victims aren't valued equally. 
    We have other aggravating circumstances such as robbery, kidnapping, events of that sort that warrant the state seeking the death penalty. 
    In fact, under South Carolina law I would submit that the state with the presence of aggravating circumstances is faced with a situation where the death penalty is warranted... is warranted but for the presence of certain mitigating circumstances which the sentencer in the case decides warrants the dispensing of mercy to the accused. 
    And for that reason, the status of the law... the Supreme Court in Gaskins, State v. Gaskins, held that victim's personal characteristics... the fact that Rudolph Tyner, who himself was a death row inmate in South Carolina, was killed while he resided on death row by Mr. Gaskins and the fact that he had confessed to prior murders was irrelevant when the decision came to be made about whether Mr. Gaskins was to live or to die. 
    And the sentence Imposed in Gaskins, of course, was... was the death penalty. 
    Now, in its reply brief, the state argues that Gaskins is really unclear. 
    We don't really know what the law is in South Carolina because that opinion is not clearly... doesn't clearly state the status of the law. 
    But I would submit you ultimately have to look at the language in the Gathers' opinion where it cites Gaskins for the proposition that evidence of a victim's bad character is inadmissible in a sentencing phase trial. 
    I'd move on to the second point that the Respondent would like to make, and that is given the status of the law in South Carolina, there was really no mechanism there in place for us to challenge or rebut the evidence that the solicitor or the points the solicitor urged in his argument to test the accuracy and the reliability of them. 
    Now, Skipper v. South Carolina is a case that attorneys in South Carolina think is a very important case. 
    And, of course, the concurring opinion in Skipper talks about the need to be able to confront and test the reliability and the accuracy of information that's being used as a basis for a death sentence. 
    And in South Carolina... of course, that case relies on Gardner v. Florida.

    Justice Scalia 
    Well, I assume you wouldn't be able to get in... If the theory on which this were admitted were... were not Just that these were characteristics of the victim, which the jury can take into account, but rather they were characteristics of the victim that the defendant knew of and therefore the Jury can take it into account, I suppose you wouldn't be able to introduce any rebuttal evidence unless you could also show that the defendant knew of that. 
    For instance, if you had rebuttal evidence that showed that this fellow really wasn't a good Christian... he Just pretended to be a Christian... that wouldn't make any difference so long as the defendant didn't know that he was a phony Christian--

 For instance, if you had rebuttal evidence that showed that this fellow really wasn't a good Christian... he Just pretended to be a Christian... that wouldn't make any difference so long as the defendant didn't know that he was a phony Christian--

    Mr. William Isaac Diggs 
    But if the law is that the evidence is admissible anyway regardless of whether it reflects on circumstances of the crime or characteristics of the defendant, then you would obviously have a right and a duty to go out and solicit or dig up the information that shows the contrary and introduce it at... at the sentencing phase in mitigation. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions, I believe that would be all that I have this morning.
