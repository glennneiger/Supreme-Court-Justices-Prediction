Alabama v. Smith

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument next in No. 88-333, Alabama against James Lewis Smith.
speaker="p_david_bjurberg" startTime="12.641" stopTime="92.510">
    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In North Carolina v. Pearce, this Court established a prophylactic rule, a presumption of vindictiveness to correct due process violations by courts that sentenced a defendant to more than... more time after a successful appeal. 
    The evil sought to be corrected was retaliation in success... for successfully appealing. 
    In this case, Smith, that is, the Respondent, appealed his guilty plea, and, upon retrial, his sentence on the burglary charge was enhanced from 30 years to life. 
    He was also sentenced to life on a reinstated sodomy charge and given 150 years on the rape conviction to run consecutively to the other charges. 
    Later cases by this Court has established that the Pearce presumption only applies to situations in which a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness exists because of the severity of the presumption, which may operate in the absence of proof of improper motive, and, thereby, block a legitimate state response to criminal conduct.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Let me get one thing straight in my mind, Mr. Bjurberg.

    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    Yes.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    The original appeal to the Alabama, it was the Court of Criminal Appeals in this case, was on the basis that the guilty plea had not been knowingly made?
speaker="p_david_bjurberg" startTime="109.554" stopTime="128.348">
    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    The narrow basis was that the Defendant was not told the correct minimum and maximum possible range of sentences under our habitual felony offender statute and an enhancement statute when a weapon or dangerous instrument is used. 
    It was not based on a violation of Boykin.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="128.348" stopTime="140.491">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So, he... he appealed his sentence on the guilty plea and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld his appeal, and, what, sent it back for resentencing without that guilty plea?

    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    Yes. 
    What the Petitioner, the state of Alabama, is asking this Court to consider in this particular case is, in a retrial after a guilty plea, that since there are other readily apparent explanations for the increased... increased sentence on the retrial, that there is no need for the evidentiary aid, namely, the presumption that Pearce created.

    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    It's important that there was a plea bargain in our case, because, in the plea bargain, the prosecutor and the court are oftentimes, or always, almost, engaging in exchange for that plea bargain, either sentencing concessions or charge concessions, as in this case. 
    So the fact that there is a plea bargain, I think, is very important, in that it throws this case into the U.S. v. Brady and the Santobello line of cases, where it's acceptable to, in exchange for a guilty plea, to offer sentencing concessions and to... charge concessions.

    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    --Right. 
    Part of what was not in Rice that... that we feel is in our particular case is the influence of the... the plea bargaining that... that was not sanctioned by this Court until U.S. v. Brady, which was subsequent to Pearce. 
    So that it's that aspect of the plea bargaining that becomes important and which distinguishes, or... or which allows this Court to rule our way without overruling Rice. 
    The other readily apparent fact that the reason for the increased sentence is not as a result of vindictiveness is that, in the guilty pleas context... the judge... and prosecutor, but primarily the judge since we're discussing sentencers... is... is extending leniency in exchange for that guilty plea. 
    Ands this Court in U.S. v.... in its previous decisions, has held that the state is entitled to extend leniency or sentencing concessions to those who do... who plead guilty. 
    That was in Corbitt v. New Jersey. 
    And that is the other, readily apparent explanation for the increased sentence at the subsequent trial, retrial.

    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    --Yes. 
    The other readily apparent explanation other than vindictiveness, which I've pointed to in our brief, is that the... after, at the trial, or the, the retrial of the case, the court, then, is much more aware of the defendant's mental and moral attitudes concerning his own... rehabilitation and attitudes in the case. 
    And this is illustrated by the facts in this particular case. 
    The judge stated that his decision in increasing the sentence on the retrial was partly... partially based on the defendant's outlook on it, I assume, meaning the... the case, the Defendant's position during trial and "what you said at it", meaning the trial, an apparent reference to the, what the judge considered to be the Defendant's perjury-- 
    So that, that, this explanation also is readily apparent on the retrial of any... of a case. 
    And this is a sufficient explanation for the enhanced sentence versus a presumption that the enhanced sentence is, in fact, a... the product of vindictiveness.

speaker="p_david_bjurberg" startTime="714.128" stopTime="903.535">
    Mr. P. David Bjurberg 
    --I believe it would be, that the... the Alabama Supreme Court could then engage in... in, or remand it to the Court of Criminal Appeals for them to determine whether or not there is evidence of actual vindictiveness. 
    And I think that's another aspect of this case, that's not before this Court, the... part of the Pearce was protecting the defendant from the fear or the apprehension of... of vindictive sentence. 
    But that is not present in this case, because, obviously, the Defendant was not afraid of... of appealing. 
    And in fact, in... I think it was... well, I don't have... Michigan v. Payne, this Court made the same type of statement that the... so, the only issue, really, before this Court, then, would be the issue of vindictiveness, not the apprehension of the vindictiveness. 
    I believe that the facts of this case fully support or illustrate the... the points that I'm trying to make, namely that, at retrial, the judge will always be in possession of more knowledge concerning the facts and the defendant's attitudes concerning his participation in the crime than he is in the guilty plea proceeding that started the process. 
    In our case, at the guilty plea sentencing, the... the Defendant did admit that he had the kni, had a knife. 
    He did admit to having sexual intercourse with the victim in this crime. 
    However, what was left out and which was subsequently developed at the trial was the atrociousness in the... of the... of the crime, the fact that this attack lasted for over an hour, and the fact that, not just one act of non-consentual sexual intercourse occurred, but that four acts of rape and two acts of sodomy were performed on this woman while the defendant was holding a knife to her throat. 
    Now, that's... that idea is contested by the Respondent, the idea of the... knife being held to the Defendant's throat. 
    But the, there was a demonstration by the victim in the record, which, the... the judge, observing it, later, in the motion for new trial, determined that that was what was going... what was happening. 
    And there is no doubt that the victim was... I mean, the Defendant was threatening the victim throughout the... this ordeal with the use of a knife. 
    So it's... it's that relationship between the lack of information at a guilty plea versus the full information that the trial judge or the sentencing judge will have that makes the presumption of vindictiveness not appropriate in... in this narrow situation. 
    The other... the other issue we petition, well, if I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebut. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Paul J. Larkin, Jr.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="903.535" stopTime="924.465">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Bjurberg. 
    Mr. Larkin?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="924.465" stopTime="1011.923">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The second question presented in this case, the one Mr. Bjurberg was just about to advert to, concerns the type of information on which a judge may rely in increasing the sentence a defendant first received when he pled guilty. 
    That question has considerable practical importance for the federal government, because, under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a judge must always state his reasons for imposing a sentence. 
    So the circumstances in which a judge, in a case like this, may increase a sentence, directly bears on that second question and is of considerable importance to us. 
    The Respondent argues that, when a defendant withdraws from a guilty plea, he can never thereafter have a sentence increased based on evidence that is developed at a trial and that, even if he can, he could not have his own sentence increased in this case because the reasons given by the trial judge were insufficient. 
    We think that respondent's arguments are wrong as a matter of law and are irrational as a matter of policy. 
    The McCullough case decided by this Court three years ago made clear that a trial judge at a second sentencing proceeding may impose an enhanced sentence on a defendant if the judge relies on new and objective facts, facts that were unknown to the judge when he first sentenced the defendant. 
    That condition was satisfied here. 
    As Mr. Bjurberg explained, at the time the judge resentenced the Defendant, he said that he was unaware that numerous rapes and sodomies had occurred on the night in question, and he said he was unaware that the victim had been threatened with a knife.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1011.923" stopTime="1019.029">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Do you think that that approach is consistent with the Court's decision in the Rice case, the companion case to Pearce?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1019.029" stopTime="1057.385">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    But in the Rice case, the Court applied a presumption and the Court said that the state of Alabama, in that case, at no time sought to dispel that presumption. 
    Here, even if a presumption applies, under McCullough, it's clear the presumption can be rebutted. 
    And, therefore, the McCullough case and the Rice case have to be read together. 
    If Rice adopts a presumption that would be applicable here, and we don't think the Court necessarily has to agree with that, but even if it does, under McCullough, that presumption can be rebutted. 
    And the judge's reasons in this case are sufficient under McCullough to rebut that presumption.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Correct. 
    We don't think that the Court should have to read Rice to govern this case. 
    Justice Kennedy asked that question, and I don't think you would have to overrule Rice in order to rule in the state's favor on the first question. 
    There are two different aspect of the ruling in Pearce. 
    The first is the due process ruling that a defendant cannot be vindictively sentenced simply for having successfully set aside the first judgment. 
    That is a basic due process principle, but is not necessarily this... the one that is at issue in a case like this one. 
    That part, as Justice O'Connor asked, deals with a question of actual vindictiveness, and a defendant can always attempt to show actual vindictiveness. 
    But what's at concern here in the first question is whether you should presume that the sentence the judge imposed at the second sentencing proceeding was retaliatory in nature. 
    Now, in Rice, it is true, the Court did apply that presumption. 
    But Rice was the companion case to Pearce, which first adopted this rule. 
    Rice preceded, therefore, this Court's decisions in cases like Bordeni ircher and Corbitt. 
    And those cases are significant because those cases make clear that you can extend leniency to a defendant who accepts responsibility and enters a plea, and you can deny the same leniency to a defendant who refuses to accept responsibility and, instead, elects to go to trial. 
    So it's that type of rule which the Court has labeled a prophylactic rule that's at issue in the first question. 
    And, just as the Court has been willing in a variety of contexts, such as exclusionary rule or the application of Miranda, to modify prophylactic rules when new situations show that it may be irrational to apply that rule in other contexts, so, too, the Court should be willing to modify the type of rule that was applied to Rice, himself, in light of the changed circumstances that have gone on in the 20 some-odd years we've had since the Pearce case was decided.

speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1201.012" stopTime="1362.285">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Well, if you distinguish Rice that way and you exclude the plea bargaining process, then, yes. 
    But I think one of the reasons for excluding the plea bargaining process is that, in that process, it's well-accepted... in fact, the dissent in the court below stated that it was a custom to afford a defendant leniency in exchange for a plea. 
    Now, there will also be cases where a judge extends a defendant leniency in exchange for a plea where there's no plea bargain. 
    That would probably happen normally in what would be called misdemeanors and minor offenses, not major felonies, where someone maybe isn't even represented by a lawyer, who pleads guilty. 
    A judge may, in that circumstance, also extend leniency to a defendant simply because the defendant has come in and said, 
    "I did it. " 
    "I'm sorry; I won't do it again and I accept responsibility. " 
    In fact, the federal sentencing guidelines have elevated this custom to a rule. 
    A defendant who accepts responsibility, under a plea bargain or not, or even after going to trial, is entitled to credit. 
    So, if you were to limit Rice in the way, uh, I said, just to plea bargains, then you wouldn't have to, as Justice Kennedy asked, overrule the Rice case. 
    However, it's possible that the rationale for limiting Rice to plea bargains would also apply in other cases where there was no plea bargain, because a judge, in fact, bestowed leniency on someone for pleading guilty. 
    Respondent makes much ado of two facts in trying to say that the judge did not adequately rebut the presumption here. 
    Respondent first argues that the judge relied on his subjective impression as to the crimes. 
    That's true, but it's immaterial. 
    As long as the judge relies on new and objective information, a judge is entitled to re-evaluate the heinousness of the crime or the incorrigibility of the defendant in coming to a... a decision as to what particular sentence best serves the deterrent and retributive functions of the law. 
    The respondent also argues that there were no new facts elicited regarding the burglary rather than the sexual assaults. 
    That fact is irrelevant. 
    What the judge did here, essentially, was put together a sentencing package to try to decide what sentence best served the... the functions of the law and ensured, in this particular case, for example, the respondent either never is released from prison or is released only after serving a very long prison term. 
    There's no requirement in this Court's decisions, and in fact, the decisions in Wasman and McCullough or to the contrary, that the new facts directly relate to the crime for which the defendant is sentenced. 
    The McCullough decision and the Wasman decision basically show that what the Court has done, and, I believe, sensibly, has been to re-evaluate through experience the circumstances in which the presumption should apply and at which the presumption can be rebutted. 
    That type of re-evaluation was properly applied in this case. 
    The judgment below should, therefore, be reversed.

    I want to begin by trying to restore the proper factual context for this case and I will start with the question raised by Justice Stevens, whether plea bargaining is at all critical to this Court's determination of the case. 
    The answer is absolutely not. 
    Plea bargaining, as a practice, as a policy, is not implicated on the facts of this case. 
    What we have here is a simple guilty plea that results in a conviction. 
    The Defendant is charged with three crimes. 
    The plea agreement is quite simple. 
    He pleads guilty to two of those crimes. 
    In exchange, the prosecutor agrees to drop the third.

    Ms. Delores R. Boyd 
    --Justice O'Connor, that's absolutely correct. 
    What is distinguishable, though, is that the bargain did not include any negotiations or concessions at all with reference to sentencing. 
    Why that is critical is that the state has lost absolutely no advantage. 
    When that guilty plea conviction was reversed, all the state did was reinstate the third crime and the Defendant then went to trial on all three crimes. 
    So we don't have the usual situation, as is suggested in the cases presented by both the government and the state, of a defendant and a prosecutor, sometimes involving the judge, hassling about a sentence. 
    And the defendant then changing his mind because he gets a sentence that he didn't believe that he should have gotten, then wanting to withdraw the guilty plea. 
    This is not just a withdrawn guilty plea; this is a conviction that gets reversed because the sentencing judge made errors that invalidated the guilty plea on constitutional grounds.

    Ms. Delores R. Boyd 
    Justice O'Connor, that is clear on the record. 
    It's important, though, that that crime is not before this Court. 
    It wasn't before the Alabama Supreme Court, and it's not before this Court. 
    This Court and the Alabama Supreme Court have just one conviction and one sentence to deal with. 
    That is the sentence that had to do with burglary, not rape, not sodomy. 
    The question here is classic Pearce question. 
    In the instance when a sentencing judge applies a sentence upon a conviction, whether it's based on a guilty plea or based on a jury verdict, may that same sentencing judge, upon reconviction, come back and enhance the sentence? 
    The Rice case that dealt with Pearce, that, that was affirmed by this Court in Pearce, is precisely on point. 
    I take issue with the state in suggesting that this is not the Rice case.

    No, sir... no, Your Honor. 
    The... the sentence was a 30-year sentence for burglary, a 30-year sentence for rape. 
    They were to run concurrently. 
    Thereafter, the Defendant exercised a right that Alabama statutes provided him. 
    That right was to appeal to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals the constitutional sufficiency of the conviction, based on the guilty plea. 
    He appealed it, Mr. Chief Justice, responding to your earlier question, he appealed it because he believed that he was not mentally coherent when the guilty plea was taken, and that, therefore, the guilty plea itself was deficient. 
    Now, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals did not address that specific contention but found, nevertheless, that the guilty plea was constitutionally deficient because the trial judge had absolutely refused or declined to properly inform the Defendant of the maximum sentence he was exposing himself to by pleading guilty. 
    That's a constitutional prerequisite. 
    Therefore, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals very reluctantly said, 
    "We have no choice but to vacate this conviction. " 
    Thereafter, he went to trial on all three cases.

    The new sentences were these: burglary, life; sodomy, life, to run concurrent. 
    On the rape, 150 years, to run consecutive to the other sentences. 
    For whatever reason, trial counsel chose not to appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court the convictions on the rape and the convictions on the sodomy. 
    The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, in fact, remanded the rape conviction, indicating that that 150-year sentence exceeded the statutory permissible sentence. 
    So the only sentence that should command our attention is the life sentence for burglary. 
    And why does Pearce apply?

    --Justice O'Connor, the Court of Appeals did not detail in its opinion any... any... analysis of it, but, as I read the Alabama Supreme Court opinion, the, it held that the presumption wasn't overcome. 
    It addressed itself to whether the trial court could rely upon the information elucidated at trial about the details of the offense. 
    Before it could make that inquiry, it had to consider the Defendant's arguments, and the Defendant's arguments were simple. 
    We believe that this judge is penalizing us because we chose to appeal the guilty plea condition.

    Its opinion does not set forth an analysis. 
    The fact that it looked at it has to be suggested by the fact that it went on to determine whether it was overcome. 
    It determined whether the trial court could rely upon details of the crime as they were elucidated at trial.

    When this Court, in Pearce, talked about whether we look to an actual evidence of motivation or whether there are other indicators, it gave guidance in the case law that followed. 
    One reason this presumption ought to apply here is that we have the very same sentencing authority who has demonstrated on this record both a personal interest and an institutional interest in having a retaliatory motivation against this Defendant.

    This Court has held that a different judge would make a difference.

    I'm not willing to embrace, as... as a general rule, a different judge makes a difference.

    --Although this Court's opinion in McCullough, the majority opinion was not embraced by this entire Court, it specifically suggested that it is a case-by-case analysis that ought to be employed because of the difficulty in ascertaining actual vindictiveness. 
    This case almost cries out for an analysis of this judge's role. 
    Here is a judge who admits on the record, before he makes the first sentence, that he has received from the defendant, without knowledge of the defendant's lawyers, letters, which, in, in his own statement, bear out, substantiate and corroborate the defendant's guilt. 
    Here's a judge who, at the initial sentencing hearing, expresses on the record that he himself is convinced of the Defendant's guilty calls up to the bench someone totally unrelated to the proceedings, the defendant's alleged girlfriend, hands her the letters that the court has received ex parte, and says to her, "You read them". 
    And after she concludes them, makes the inquiry, 
    "Now, are you as satisfied as I am that he is guilty? " 
    Here is a judge who moves on on a motion for a recusal after the conviction is overturned, and again indicates, 
    "I received your letters. " 
    "I know you're guilty. " 
    What... what greater interest does he need to invince when he has to sit through a trial, presumably to determine an issue that he's already made up his mind on.

 Is it your view that, whenever a judge takes a guilty plea and has, maybe, a hearing to be sure there's enough factual support to take the plea, that, thereafter, the judge is disqualified from trying the case if the plea later is withdrawn? 
 Because, in every case, the judge has pretty good reason to believe the defendant's guilty if he's entered a plea.

    --That is the preferred procedure. 
    That is not, from a policy point of view, a practical procedure. 
    And that is why I did not embrace that, is what I'm asking this Court to do. 
    This Court doesn't even have to go that far. 
    This Court need only analyze what information the judge had at the time of the second sentencing and whether that information disqualified him from making a sentence free from vindictiveness.

    But, but that, that, that isn't the point here. 
    The, the Alabama courts didn't decide in your client's favor on the basis that the judge should have disqualified himself. 
    They decided in your client's favor on the basis that the Pearce presumption applied.

    Ms. Delores R. Boyd 
    --The Pearce presumption, Your Honor, as I read Rice and the underlying case, is grounded on a due process right that recognizes not only actual vindictiveness, but a defendant's perception of vindictiveness. 
    So, by asking this judge to disqualify himself, the defendant himself was indicating his own belief that he could not have a fair trial at the hands of this judge. 
    Why does that... why does that matter for the Pearce presumption? 
    It matters for the Pearce presumption because it goes to whether there is a realistic likelihood of actual vindictiveness. 
    A retrial here was necessary solely because the sentencing judge made errors of a constitutional magnitude. 
    That was a finding of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    And it was a finding that was very scathing as to the omissions of the trial judge.

    Burglary and, and sodomy, at the second sentencing were both life sentences running concurrently. 
    The 150-year rape sentence was a consecutive sentence. 
    So what your... what your determination is on the burglary affects the sodomy anyway, and I'm sure that is perhaps why trial counsel did not raise that in the courts below.

    Ms. Delores R. Boyd 
    I think both issues are still open because of the procedural posture of this case. 
    So it does matter what this Court does. 
    Let me turn to the issue of, if Pearce applies, has it been overcome? 
    In that connection, we do not advance the absolute rule that the government suggests, and that is that a trial court should never be free to consider facts of the offense as they are revealed at trial. 
    That is not our argument. 
    Our argument is, number one, Pearce requires the trial court to affirmatively record on the record, and this trial judge didn't do it. 
    We're not talking about rape, we're not talking about sodomy. 
    The question is whether this trial judge advanced anything at all on the record to justify enhancing a 30-year burglary sentence to life. 
    The record is absolutely void and, under Pearce, that should end the inquiry. 
    The government and the state suggested this is some type of package deal and the... and... and the trial court should have had the right to listen to the details of the rape at trial and consider that enhancing the sentence. 
    Why that's fallacious is that all three crimes called for separate penalties.

    There's nothing on the record that suggests that he decided to enhance the burglary because of evidence he heard on rape because he also enhanced the rape.

    Ms. Delores R. Boyd 
    Justice Kennedy, the legislative scheme for... for punishment of burglary, rape and sodomy considered... took into consideration the fact that a burglary is entry of a residence to commit another crime, and, in doing so, categorized it as a Class A felony, separately punishable. 
    We could just as easily say that the judge decided to take into consideration the fact that this defendant had taken an appeal of a burglary conviction and had embarrassed him before the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals by having that court remind the trial judge that the guilty plea was constitutionally deficient. 
    That is so... that is why it is important that the information that the trial judge rely upon be specifically stated as to the crime. 
    Now, if you believe that what he stated was adequate, then test it by whether it was objective and whether it was new, whether was anything at all that he didn't know before. 
    All we have is he didn't know that there were five rapes. 
    Now he knows that. 
    That may justify enhancing the rape, but it shouldn't justify enhancing the burglary against the backdrop of those other factors. 
    I'm suggesting, Your Honor, that you cannot divorce a determination in this case of whether the additional information was adequate from whether there existed indicators of a retaliatory motivation for this trial judge. 
    To... to do so would simply give the trial judge a convenience excuse to mask his vindictiveness. 
    He is always going to hear more at trial than he is going to get at the guilty plea. 
    There is always going to be more about the flavor of the trial... of... of the offense itself, more details. 
    So if he has a reason to be vindictive against this defendant in the first instance, all he need say is, 
    "Well, now I've heard more evidence at trial. " 
    "I understand now you did five rapes. " 
    "There were two or three other crimes. " 
    That is why the rule that we advance is not an absolute rule. 
    It is a case-by-case proposition. 
    Thank you.
