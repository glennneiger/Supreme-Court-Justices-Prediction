    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This summons enforcement case presents two distinct issues. 
    First, the authority of the district court to place a condition on its enforcement order requiring the IRS to return to the court for prior approval of certain uses of a summon material. 
    And, second, the correctness of the standard applied by the court of appeals in ruling upon Respondents' claim of attorney/client privilege for one of the summoned documents. 
    I will turn my attention initially and primarily to the first question, which has major implications for the effective conduct of IRS investigations generally. 
    Respondents here oppose the enforcement of the IRS' summons on the ground that it was not issued in good faith. 
    Specifically, they alleged that the IRS was seeking the summoned documents not for use in its own tax investigation of Ron Hubbard but for the purpose of furnishing the documents to the Department of Justice for use in the defense of a civil damage suit that had been brought against federal officials by the Church of Scientology. 
    After a hearing, the district court emphatically rejected these allegations and ordered the summons enforced. 
    In its order, the court stated, and I quote from page 27(a) at the Appendix to the Petition, 
    "The Church has failed to raise any doubt of the good faith of the IRS in pursuing this summons enforcement proceeding. " 
    And the court went on to state that the agent did not issue the summons for an improper or collateral purpose. 
    At the hearing, the court was even more explicit. 
    And, again, I quote from page 45 of the Joint Appendix. 
    "There is not an iota of evidence that this summons is being prosecuted for any reason other than to gather information for the ongoing investigation. " 
    Nevertheless, faced with continued entreaties by Respondents' counsel that the IRS' aim in fact was to turn over the summon material to the Justice Department, and also with the government's statement that it had no such intention, the court sua sponte placed a condition on its enforcement order. 
    Namely, the court held that the summoned material could not be disclosed to any other government agency without a prior order of the court. 
    And the court went on to suggest at the hearing that it would issue such an order if the government could demonstrate that the proposed disclosure complied with the confidentiality rules of Section 6103.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, we recognize, Justice O'Connor, that this particular restriction that was entered in this case is a narrow one and it's fairly benign, in fact, because the government didn't plan to turn over any information, to the Justice Department.

    --that on the facts of this case... so it would never have occasion to go to the court and nothing would happen. 
    But... but it is our contention that the general principle that underlies the district court's, the only way in which its order can be supported by authority, and the principle that was explicitly adopted by the court of appeals is in fact the broad one that has the potential to be extremely damaging to IRS investigations.

 You stress that the district court said there is not an iota of evidence of bad faith, harassment, or anything of that kind. 
 What if the district judge had said there's been a lot of evidence offered of bad faith. 
 I think in balance it doesn't carry the day and I want to let the government enforce the subpoena. 
 But just as additional insurance, I'm going to order them to limit its use in this way. 
 Would your argument be any different?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Well, because... because this idea... I was going to quote what the... in response to Justice O'Connor what the court of appeals actually held here, which is that the district court's order in this case created a mechanism whereby the district court court monitor the IRS' use of the summoned documents. 
    This is an appropriate exercise of the district court's discretion. 
    Now, this is an extremely damaging statement, extremely damaging policy for the courts to take because it allows the district courts to issue all kinds of orders that will put various restrictions on the IRS' investigation and require the IRS to keep coming back to the district court--

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    As we pointed out in our reply brief, there is a presumption that the government intends to comply with the law. 
    And courts cannot go out issuing orders just telling parties that they have to comply with the law. 
    I mean, the problem here is less substantive, especially in this particular case where the judge at least said that he was going to allow the government to make any disclosure that was authorized under Section 6103. 
    But the problem is procedural. 
    And this Court has grappled in many different contexts with the various procedures applicable to summons enforcement proceedings and has constantly reiterated the importance of having summary enforcement proceedings once it will not interfere with the IRS' investigation. 
    And it is our view that this kind of regime under which the courts will... well, maybe issue the summons for now but keep looking to see what the IRS is doing with the information, have the IRS come back if they're going to do something that's a little questionable, overall poses a great threat to effective investigations and one that outweighs the fact that it may be in some case, as Justice Stevens posits, the court may in fact be impelled to deny enforcement for that reason. 
    I think these courts' decisions, in addition to continually emphasizing, as recently as last month's decision in Stuart, the summary nature of IRS investigations also reflect the fact that the summons enforcement scheme has always been understood as one where the district court's role is limited and one that takes place in one slice of time. 
    The district court looks at the IRS' summons when it's issue at the time of the enforcement proceeding and decides at that time whether the summons has been issued in good faith for a legitimate purpose under the statute. 
    And at that point, it decides either to deny or to compel enforcement. 
    The statute that gives the court jurisdiction, gives it authority only to compel enforcement and, of course, to decline to compel enforcement. 
    It does not contemplate--

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --The statute, I think, was enacted in 1976. 
    Section 7431. 
    Well, let me given an example in a different context. 
    If there was a Freedom of Information Act suit that was brought and... and the requestor claims that he's entitled... that there's no exceptions applicable... he's entitled to the documents and the government has to turn them over under the FOIA, surely the judge's role in that kind of a suit is to look at the Freedom of Information Act and decide whether the information is protected or whether it should be disclosed. 
    It's not the Judge's business to find out what the requestor plans to do with the information after he gets it. 
    It's not the judge's concern whether the requestor is planning to use it to get more information to run some extortion scheme, or something. 
    That's just not the Judge's province in that kind of suit. 
    It's up to the judge to decide, under the standards set forth in FOIA, whether the information is to be disclosed. 
    And when the judge has made that determination, he either orders the information disclosed or not. 
    And then he is done. 
    He doesn't tell the requestor, okay, I'm going to give you the information but you come back here every six months and I want to make sure that you're not using it for some--

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    --I think I'd like to mention one other policy point that's involved here in addition to the delay that can occur. 
    Actually, the delay can occur at two stages. 
    If these kinds of restrictive orders are permitted, we think (a) that it will cause additional delay at the initial summons enforcement stage where, as opposed to the normal fairly summary proceeding where litigants occasionally are challenging whether there's bad faith or good faith and whether the summons should be enforced, there will be a whole additional set of litigation over what sort of restrictions are appropriate for which documents. 
    They are appropriate and possible appeals from that kind of litigation. 
    And also, of course, down the road you have the problem of where the IRS is required to come back to the court for permission to make the particular use that's been restricted. 
    Even if the Court agrees with the IRS that the disclosure, or whatever it is, is permissible, it's still a serious problem because the investigation is halted in the middle, the IRS has to run back to the court. 
    As you know, they have to get a court date. 
    They can't just walk in that morning. 
    And the whole thing is halted for a period of time. 
    Second, at least in the 6103 context, most of the disclosures that are going to be sought by the IRS in this connection... or, many of them anyway... are going to come under Section 6103(k)(6) which is disclosures that are necessary for law enforcement purposes for the IRS investigation. 
    I think in order for the IRS to persuade the court that the disclosure is necessary for that purpose, it's going to have to give a little bit of a roadmap of its investigation to the court to explain why the disclosure is necessary. 
    And that obviously can inhibit the success of the investigation if that kind of information is provided to the target, a problem that this Court alluded to in the O'Brien case. 
    I think I should turn briefly now to the attorney/client question, if there are no further questions on the summons issue. 
    The question here is whether the tape recording of a meeting between certain church officials and their counsel is protected by the attorney/client privilege because the government did not prove by evidence independent of the communications themselves that the meeting was in furtherance of a crime or fraud. 
    The IRS here produced as evidence that the crime-fraud exception applied a partial transcript of the tape that had been furnished by an informant. 
    And, in addition, because this tape had actually been in the possession of the IRS for a short time, and an IRS official had listened to the tape, the IRS also proffered the affidavit of an IRS agent describing the contents of the tape. 
    The court of appeals held that this highly-probative evidence cannot be considered in determining the applicability of the crime-fraud exception because it is not independent of the communications itself... themselves. 
    The result of the court of appeals rule is that there are going to be cases where the court knows to an absolute certainty that the communications are not privileged. 
    Nevertheless, it will be bound to deny probative evidence to the factfinder on grounds of attorney/client privilege. 
    This rule leads to a perverse result--

    In that case, we recognize that the district court has discretion to deny in camera review. 
    If the government just came in and said, we want you to look at the documents in camera with nothing else,... I'm not saying they couldn't do it, but I suspect the judge would deny it. 
    And I don't think we would have any grounds for complaining. 
    I think naturally any time you're going to ask the district court to do something like that, you're going to have to come in with some sort of reason to make the judge do it.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I believe that the... addressing, first, the crime-fraud issue... I believe that the government has effectively conceded that there is a need for some independent evidence... an independent evidence rule, as it were... before a court may upon a mere incantation of the words crime-fraud review privileged communications between an attorney and a client for which a privilege has already been established. 
    If I understood counsel's answers to the questions posed by Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens, he said there has to be some sort of evidence, there has to be some sort of reason submitted by the government.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    Well, in fact, Justice Stevens, the trial judge over our objections did look at the massive excerpts from the tape recordings, which are the communications in this particular case, and in fact found that they did not establish a prima facie case of crime or fraud. 
    So, the district court in this case, in an ironic twist, over our objection, did look at the communication. 
    The court of appeals, however, said that the district court should have initially considered independent evidence only to determine whether there was communication in furtherance of a crime or fraud. 
    And we think that that test, which was enunciated by the Ninth Circuit, and which as we have demonstrated in our briefs is in practice employed in one form or another by many courts of appeals and federal district courts throughout the country, is the proper approach. 
    The... the analysis should not turn on whether fortuitously the government or an adverse civil party has managed to get privileged communication, and has them, and can submit them to the court along with an allegation of crime-fraud. 
    There has to be a standardized, methodical and logical approach before the analysis can be made.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    Your Honor, the courts have given slightly different formulations. 
    The Second Circuit apparently does use a probable cause standard. 
    The Ninth Circuit, without elaboration referred to... and all the courts, of course, refer to the prima facie test. 
    We submit that the prima facie test in the general sense in which that term is used means a case... a prima facie showing... a case which is enough to support a directed verdict if unrebutted. 
    We're comfortable enough with that definition.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --We don't see any such inconsistency at all. 
    In fact, if anything, Justice Rehnquist, we think that the Bourjaily case supports us. 
    In that case this Court merely determined that the showing the preliminary evidentiary determination by a district court judge on the co-conspirator hearsay exception under Rule 801 could be made by looking at the hearsay statements themselves. 
    This Court did not reach a question of whether it could be made exclusively by looking at those statements, but it said they could be considered.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --However, Justice Rehnquist, the foundation for this Court's decision in Bourjaily was referenced to Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. 
    And that Rule provides that in making preliminary evidentiary determinations a court may look at any evidence except privileged communications. 
    And we are, of course... we fall within the privilege. 
    These... These tapes which are at issue in this case were found to be privileged communications. 
    So, the 104(a) exception--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Well, how... how do you know whether they're privileged communications, though, if... if... before you decide this challenge in one way or the other, because the crime-fraud exception says it's not privileged if there is crime-fraud involved?

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --Well, Your Honor, in this way. 
    Because we were able to establish without submission to the court in camera below in the district court that these documents were presumptively privileged. 
    And then the burden shifts... when somebody comes later on, as the government did, the burden shifts to the opponent of the privilege. 
    And they carry a serious burden here to try to strip the privilege. 
    And that's the analyses. 
    This is not just a concurrent mix necessarily. 
    In the first instance, these communications--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't have... I'm not sure that there's an authority that specifically addresses the order in which the crime-fraud exception is applied on a claim of privilege. 
    But in very many cases it is undisputed that communications are protected by the attorney/client privilege, save for the possibility that they may be subject to the crime-fraud exception and that the crime-fraud exception will strip them of the privilege. 
    For instance, when the government's subpoenas for documents from an attorney office for a grand jury, for example, they rarely will say these were not communications in confidence between the attorney and the client. 
    They will assert... they will in effect concede that but for their claim of the crime-fraud exception the documents are privileged. 
    And that's what I'm referring to in this particular instance.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --The kind of evidence that invariably the government or civil parties have anyway. 
    That there was some wrongdoing. 
    I mean, presumably the government is not conducting a grand jury investigation or allegations made in a civil case in a vacuum. 
    They're not taking... randomly accusing somebody of wrongdoing. 
    They have some evidence that there was wrongdoing going on, and they have prima facie evidence or reason to believe that the attorneys may have furthered the wrongdoing. 
    And they make the allegation of the crime-fraud exception. 
    But the government cannot go around and... and I do not understand counsel to suggest that they could randomly without any basis in fact suspect that an attorney/client communications between... confidential communications were in furtherance of a crime-fraud. 
    And that's all the prima facie case requires. 
    It only requires that the mere invocation of the words crime-fraud be supported by some factual underpinning before--

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --Your Honor, we would say that the salutary effect of the independent evidence rule in those rare instances where a party happens to have the confidences to begin with... and that would be extremely rare... normally when the party is seeking access to the attorney/client communications, they don't have them to begin with. 
    But in those rare, rare instances, as by happenstance occurred for instance in this case, the purpose of the rule is better served by still requiring that there be a prima facie showing at the outset.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2027.390" stopTime="2028.545">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But not--
speaker="michael_lee_hertzberg" startTime="2028.545" stopTime="2029.451">
    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    To satisfy the court--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2029.451" stopTime="2035.417">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --where you can't rely on the documents at all even though the documents virtually scream fraud? 
    Is that your position?
speaker="michael_lee_hertzberg" startTime="2035.417" stopTime="2070.371">
    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --That the court should not look at them, in the first instance. 
    Yes, that is our position. 
    In those rare instances. 
    Again, I want to stress that it is not... it is far from normal... it is highly unusual to contemplate a situation where a... whether it's a government or a civil party... is seeking the court's process to obtain documents that they have already. 
    We do not want... we don't think the court should give an advantage to a party that manages to get within its possession before a determination by a court of the privileged communications. 
    This could encourage, for instance--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2070.371" stopTime="2081.163">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, there could be an incentive... it could be at fault. 
    There's certainly... you can't say conclusively that in effect the other party has a privileged communication means that it acquired it by fault.
speaker="michael_lee_hertzberg" startTime="2081.163" stopTime="2173.782">
    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --Not necessarily. 
    But I think that if this Court had a different rule for that particular unusual circumstance, it might encourage situations... particularly in the civil arena where major corporations are litigating against each other, and there could be an inducement for a corporation to try to... if it were a disaffected employee or otherwise... to get confidential communications from the other side and then feel all they have to do is holler crime-fraud and the court can start going through the entirety of the communications. 
    So, we think that that would be... for purposes of uniform application, there should be some quantum, which we maintain to be the prima facie showing, of crime or fraud to support that allegation before in camera review can be sought. 
    I want to turn to the other issue that is raised by the government. 
    And that is the question about the order of this Court. 
    We believe that that order is well-supported by the inherent power of Article III courts to insure that their process is not abused. 
    It is fundamental. 
    It comes from as long ago as the Gumbel v. Pitkin decision of this Court in 1888, though the Powell case which specifically in the context of summons enforcement actions warned that it is the process of the Court that is being sought to enforce a summons by the Internal Revenue Service, and courts should not allow that process to be abused.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    I... I read that, Your Honor. 
    However, respectfully, the Stuart case presented a very far and different issue and was not... I think that that one statement that you've extracted, Justice Kennedy, certainly not made in the context of the issue that's before this Court on the protective order that was issued below. 
    What the government seems... the government, by the way, has really retreated, as I understand their oral argument, from the premise of their brief... the question presented in their brief. 
    In the brief, and the question on which they sought and obtained certiorari in this Court, was the argument that district courts are wholly without authority under any circumstances whatsoever in summons enforcement proceedings to take any steps to make sure that their process is not abused. 
    They said enforcement or denial, there's no in between. 
    Now, they start their argument off today by quibbling about the record below. 
    Did we make a sufficient showing? 
    Well, the district court, notwithstanding the language which my learned opponent quoted to the Court, the district court did find that we had raised a real fear that the five documents which we were enforcing through the summons would be turned over to the government and possibly then given to civil attorneys for the Department of Justice. 
    And he articulated that fear in the record. 
    And the Ninth Circuit reviewed, looking for abusive discretion, specifically reviewed the record... and it was an ample record that was before the court... there was a hearing and there was considerable testimony to substantiate what the court of appeals decided was a real fear that information purportedly being sought under authority of the summons might be used for an improper purpose and disseminated improperly later on. 
    And the result was what my colleague calls now the narrow order or the fairly benign order of the Court. 
    And we think it was extremely narrow. 
    All it does is say to the government you can't use those five documents that I'm giving you for any purpose other than... reference to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, which is the premise on which you came to this Court in the first place. 
    Or, you must obtain an order of this Court. 
    It didn't say you can't communicate with other government agencies. 
    It didn't say you can't go out in the world and look for witnesses and talk to them and--

 I suppose you'd say there would have to be a record made before the district judge, there must be some evidence of some danger or risk of disclosure? 
 The judge just can't say, I don't trust the IRS and I'm going to enter this order, I don't suppose.

    The district court felt we had and the court of appeals felt we had... and called it a wise exercise of control and exercise of discretion. 
    And that record... I don't want to get too much into the record... but in a very brief hearing that we were afforded, there was an undisputed record of constant communication between the Department of Justice civil attorneys engaged in non-tax related litigation in Washington against the Church of Scientology.

    "Since the entire basis of the summons proceeding was to obtain material for a tax investigation, the court thinks it reasonable to restrict the use of the material for that purpose unless a criminal prosecution is administered. "

    But, just to be sure, I'll order the production of the documents. 
    But you shouldn't give them to anybody else. 
    Or, it puts some other condition on them.

    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    It's different because the Internal Revenue Service comes to the district court for enforcement of the summons. 
    The summons cannot be enforced without the authority of the district court. 
    And, for instance, the statutes under which the Internal Revenue Service must move to get summons enforcements... those are 7402(b) and 7604(a) of the Internal Revenue Code... say, by appropriate process the district court may enforce a summons. 
    The IRS must come to the district court and the moment that they do, and the moment the concept of appropriate process is implicated, at that time we submit that the court has inherent power, if it is satisfied by the showing made before it, as it was in this case, to insure that his process is not abused later on. 
    And the government has not demonstrated any way... the quibble with the record, but I submit again that's not the issue before this Court. 
    The legal issue before this Court is, is the Court... does it have that inherent power or is it utterly without that inherent power?

speaker="michael_lee_hertzberg" startTime="2916.502" stopTime="3030.097">
    Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg 
    --The court is not supplementing it, Justice White. 
    The court is in fact aiding and seeing to it that that statute and other statutes are obeyed. 
    The statutory scheme not only in 6103 but, for instance, such as in 7206 of the Internal Revenue Code which sets forth the precise narrow grounds on which a summons may be issued by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, implicates a valuation by the district court as to whether the summoned material is going to be used for a proper purpose. 
    And the government must go to the district court and it must say we want enforcement. 
    And by the way, the interests... what we're suggesting we think also strikes a perfect balance... the government is saying it's all or nothing. 
    The... the... in effect, with their argument, at worst for us there would have to be a remand to the district court if it was without power to issue the protective order that it did to determine whether it wants to deny enforcement under the circumstances. 
    But we think the kind of order that was well-reasoned and entered into this case strikes a perfect balance. 
    It gives to the Internal Revenue Service the materials it sought for the summons purposes that it wanted it. 
    But it insures, when it feels that there's a danger that it might be abused, and it at the same time insures that the court's process will not be abused and that the summons materials will not be used for an improper purpose. 
    We would think, actually, that the government would be in favor of this. 
    It historically poses the question of whether there has to be summons denial or not. 
    And, in fact, the government says that there are instances where summons are denied. 
    We think that if their all-or-nothing test is adopted, perhaps there will be more denials of summons, because district courts will then be without the option of deciding that they can take a middle ground, as the court did in this case under the circumstances which were well-warranted.

    The statute says by appropriate process such attendance, testimony, production of books, papers, and records. 
    Do you think a trial judge would have the authority to allow a responding party to produce summaries rather than original documents? 
    Say, he asked for all the accounting records of General Motors or something. 
    They could say, well, we'd like to give summaries.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Getting back to what I said before, there's a summons there and if the IRS is entitled to enforcement, the court is supposed to compel enforcement of the summons, not change it. 
    And there has been litigation on that kind of subject. 
    I'd like to talk briefly about this idea of abuse of process because it seems to me this is just the core of Respondents' argument. 
    Is that the notion the courts have an inherent authority to prevent abuse of their process basically gives them carte blanche in whatever sort of order they want in a case like this. 
    We don't deny there's inherent authority to control abuse of process, but there's nothing like that going on here. 
    This is discussed at great length by this Court in Powell case and follows through in subsequent summons enforcement cases. 
    We know what abuse of process is in this context and it is the issuance of a summons in bad faith for an illegitimate purpose that is not encompassed by the congressional grant of authority and the other is sort of power criteria. 
    If the court were... if the IRS were to get a summons under the circumstances where it did not satisfy those criteria, that would be an abuse of the court's process, and the court is entitled to protect itself against that. 
    And that's why there is a summons enforcement proceeding. 
    In this case, and in most cases, the court looked at those criteria and it found... and it found quite unequivocally that there was no bad faith. 
    That the IRS was entitled to enforcement of its summons. 
    That ends the abuse of process inquiry, and it does not give this kind of carte blanche for the court to go out there to see what the IRS is going to do with the documents down the road. 
    And I should mention, I guess, that all through summons enforcement law you see that the court does not really take it upon itself to worry about what the IRS does with documents down the road. 
    In the LaSalle case, of course, there was a great controversy over whether the summons should be enforced there because of the danger at that time information would immediately infringe on criminal discovery and the role of the grand jury because there had already been a criminal referral in effect. 
    But, of course, in the typical IRS investigation where there is no criminal referral in effect, documents are furnished to the IRS pursuant to a summons and then later on down the road, a year later, a year and a half later, the case may be referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. 
    And that information that came through the summons goes to the Justice Department at that point. 
    And there's nothing wrong with that. 
    That doesn't show abuse of the court's process or bad faith, or anything like that. 
    The idea of the summons enforcement proceeding is to decide at that time whether the summons should be enforced. 
    As far as the benignness of this particular restriction, we think the real problem here is that there is no way to draw a line between the kind of restriction that the court imposed here and much broader and more intrusive restrictions. 
    If the court has the authority to monitor the IRS' investigation, as the Ninth Circuit says, then there will be other... a lot of litigation and a lot of other restrictions that are very damaging. 
    Just to quickly summarize the attorney/client issue. 
    Of course, we don't concede that there is any independent evidence requirement. 
    When I was induced to concede that the district court would have to at least have some evidence before it made an in camera inspection, there's certainly no reason why that evidence has to be independent in the sense that Respondent was talking about. 
    Neither the court of appeals nor Respondents have given any reason why there should be such a rule, and we suggest that there shouldn't be one. 
    But, again, the issue in this case is whether the court is precluded from ever looking at so-called nonindependent evidence before it decides whether the attorney/client privilege should be taken away because of crime-fraud. 
    Thank you.
