City of Dallas v. Stanglin

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1848, the City of Dallas v. Charles M. Stanglin. 
    Mr. Hopkins?
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="10.872" stopTime="56.667">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Does the City infringe a minor's right of association by allowing dance halls to operate in the City of Dallas and admit those ages 14 to 18 only? 
    I will address that there is no constitutionally protected right of association in a dance hall; that it would be unwise to expand constitutional protection to include such a right; and that even assuming there is some right implicated by the ordinance that is challenged, the City does not infringe that right by the ordinance challenged. 
    And in any case, the City has a rational and even compelling interest in regulating dance halls for the protection of minors.

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Yes.

    Okay.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="68.275" stopTime="111.404">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    We place reliance on the Roberts precedent not only because it is the most recent analysis of associational freedoms, but also because it is reasonable. 
    This Court in that precedent without dissent tied associational freedom to the Bill of Rights and found protection first for intimate relations central to the concept of personal liberty. 
    The... all of us as American citizens enjoy a high degree of personal liberty, but we do not enjoy the personal autonomy alleged by Respondents in this case. 
    We do not enjoy the autonomy in all things that may serve us as recreation.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="111.404" stopTime="123.045">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you think the City could adopt an ordinance telling all 14-year olds that they may not under any circumstances in their lives have any association with people over 18?
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="123.045" stopTime="124.995">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    No, I think that would be going much too far.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="124.995" stopTime="127.514">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Then there is a right of social association.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="127.514" stopTime="170.275">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    No, there's not a constitutionally protected right of association. 
    Of course, minors as... as all of us, have personal liberty, but there is nothing in the Constitution which would guarantee purely recreational association. 
    I think for a city to make such a blanket prohibition would be similar perhaps to the D.C. City... City Council submitting to the mayor the curfew ordinance. 
    I think that may not be a constitutional infringement, but I think... as far as social association, but I think it raises equal protection problems and... and other sorts of constitutional--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="170.275" stopTime="172.392">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You don't think equal protection is a constitutional principle?
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="172.392" stopTime="313.735">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --It is a constitutional principle. 
    What I mean to say is that ordinance would probably not infringe the alleged constitutional protection of social association. 
    But it would implicate other constitutional protections. 
    And for that reason, I think that your hypothetical and perhaps others would be going too far. 
    Dance halls do not exhibit the characteristics of intimate associations that this Court has protected in the past. 
    They are primarily large gatherings. 
    Mr. Stanglin's testimony in the district court was that it was not unusual for there to be 800 to 1,000 persons in his establishment. 
    They are not selective in who they admit to the dance hall, and I think it's reasonable to think that of 800 or 1,000 teenagers, a large percentage are going to be strangers to each other. 
    And I think it is not reasonable to compare such a setting or such an atmosphere with, for example, the marital bedroom. 
    This Court has also recognized constitutional protection in the area of expressive association, in other words, gathering to exercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, such things as freedom of speech, religious beliefs and to petition the government. 
    However, the dance hall that is involved in this case is not an association at all in the sense of being an organization with a collective identity. 
    Patrons do not gather at a dance hall primarily to exercise their right of free speech or to petition the government, nor do they primarily go there to exercise religious beliefs. 
    So, although minors do enjoy personal liberty to some extent, they do not have this autonomy that Respondents allege in whatever serves them as recreat on. 
    I think it would be unwise to give credence to Respondent's suggestion of social associational rights because it would chill the efforts of state and local governments to create age-appropriate categories for the use of municipal facilities or what have you.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="313.735" stopTime="327.478">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I take it some part of your argument, Mr. Hopkins, depends on the fact that the plaintiffs are minors. 
    You would find it a more difficult ordinance to justify if it regulated adults under 35.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="327.478" stopTime="347.808">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    A primary tenet of my argument is the fact of their minority because I believe that the First Amendment assumes the capacity to exercise independent judgment, and minors cannot be assumed to have met that prerequisite to exercise First Amendment rights.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Let me give you a hypothetical. 
    Supposing a 15 or 16-year old person was taking dancing lessons from a person over 21 and became quite expert, and wanted to show his or her classmates and friends how expert he or she was, and wanted to give kind of a demonstration of it. 
    And the only place that it could be done is in a dance hall like this, or the only place that would happen to be available. 
    You wouldn't think they would have... there would be any constitutional interest whatsoever respecting that.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="493.619" stopTime="502.874">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    No, I don't believe our ordinance would infringe any assumed right because it doesn't ban the dancing. 
    It doesn't ban the demonstrations.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="502.874" stopTime="504.426">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It bans dancing with that particular partner.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="504.426" stopTime="519.270">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    It doesn't even ban dancing with an older person because there are exceptions to the ordinance. 
    For example, dances at schools are completely exempt from the ordinance. 
    A school does not have to obtain a dance hall license.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="519.270" stopTime="521.472">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    I believe they are. 
    The court of appeals suggested that the City's ordinance was overbroad, but I believe that analysis is flawed for several reasons. 
    First of all, there is no substantial interference with a protected right. 
    As I began, I mentioned that our position is there is no constitutional right to associate in a dance hall. 
    But even if you were to assume such a right, the ordinance challenged expands that right and not... it does not constrict it. 
    Even if you assumed that facts were appropriate to consider an overbreadth argument, I think the ordinance clearly withstands that scrutiny because it is a very narrow response to a specific request of the community to create a dance hall opportunity for the kids without the requirement that the parents go along with them. 
    It regulates only that one type of business. 
    And the exceptions keep the City out of the constitutional issues because we have exempted schools and churches, government facilities and the like from having to obtain a dance hall license.

    --No. 
    We would rely primarily on the Roberts and Rotary Club decisions most recently. 
    The other... another reason why an overbreadth argument would be inappropriate here, as I mentioned, was because the citizens specifically petitioned the government for this response. 
    In fact, Mr. Stanglin himself approached city council members and asked that there be a place such as a Class E dance hall. 
    And--

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Okay. 
    The... the court of appeals also suggested and Respondents suggest that there are other ways to accomplish the City's objectives, police enforcement of other statutes, for example. 
    I would concede that there are additional ways of combatting the problem of juvenile crime and the influence that older people can have on them to turn to drug abuse and alcohol abuse and the like, but I will not concede that there's a less intrusive way of achieving this result in the dance hall context because the police department have... are working on the problem outside the dance hall, but not inside. 
    The punishment that the court of appeals suggests does not work until there's a victim. 
    And it assumes that a perpetrator is caught and that there is some deterrent effect. 
    And supervision is not appropriate in this case because the parents have said they don't want to have to go. 
    That's the first problem. 
    The second problem is if there's 1,000 teenagers in this establishment, how are you going to effectively prohibit or prevent the undue influence from reaching them before it's too late. 
    Thus, consistent with this Court's analysis in the City of Renton case, the City of Dallas is attacking the juvenile crime problem this one step at a time, and they're doing it in the least intrusive way that they can in this dance hall context. 
    I think to expand constitutional protection beyond its already defined limits in this area would be unwise because it would chill the efforts of the governments across the entire spectrum of age-appropriate categories to effectively protect people on account of their minority. 
    I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I had prepared remarks intended to demonstrate to the Court that the City seeks here to say that there is no constitutional right of association for minors. 
    After Mr. Hopkins' remarks that you have just heard, I don't think it's necessary for me to... to deliver that. 
    We are asking the Court to protect the right of the people to associate together even if the purpose is entirely social and even if the purpose may seem trivial to many. 
    To say that there is no constitutional right at all to associate in the type of context presented in this case is to say that the state is immune in this area and may do anything that it chooses to do even if that act is arbitrary and irrational.

    It has to be taken away on an equal basis with other people. 
    I... I don't understand the state here to be arguing that there is no constitutional right. 
    They're just saying that this is not... this is not the sort of association that is governed by... by our cases saying that the First Amendment attaches to it.

    I can't go to a Class E dance hall. 
    It isn't a minor's constitutional rights case. 
    The purpose of the statute is protect the minors. 
    But the prohibition extends to everyone, and in that sense it's different than the cases that deal with minors and minors alone. 
    But to say that they can dance elsewhere is simply, with due respect, I don't believe the proper analysis. 
    In the Roberts v. Jaycees case, for example, the argument could have been made by the Jaycees that the... that the Minnesota anti-discrimination statute really didn't impose that much restriction on their liberties because, first of all, there were plenty of organizations that those women could join other than the Jaycees.

    One is the family. 
    The other end of the extreme may be measured by large business enterprises. 
    At the family end it's entitled to probably the highest protection the Constitution allows. 
    Whereas where the relationship is much more attenuated at the large business enterprise end, it's not expressly stated what standard will apply, but it's certainly not going to be the compelling state interest one.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    All right. 
    In this case, I would defend it on the basis of dance being an expressive activity. 
    And the reason I say that is this. 
    What has been singled out here for legislation by the City of Dallas is the ability of people to dance together. 
    They are free to do other things together. 
    I believe that that is a legislative disapproval of the activity of dancing which has a centuries-old history of being an expressive activity.

    I'm not sure I agree with your analysis of dancing itself.

    Some dancing looks like athletic activities too. 
    Throw them up and throw them around.
speaker="daniel_j_sheehan_jr" startTime="1844.462" stopTime="2032.516">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    Well, that's true, Justice Marshall. 
    In any event, the significance, to get back to the point... and... and I do believe this point has been made... that there is no constitutional right even in establishing the spectrum that Justice Brennan mentions, that the far end of that spectrum... he does say at one end you have the compelling state interest, strict scrutiny highest standard, and at the other end you have no constitutional rights. 
    Justice O'Connor in the expressive association aspect in the concurring opinion establishes a similar type of scale for expressive conduct. 
    One end of the scale would be the commercial enterprise, and the other being the surely expressive purpose of an organization. 
    That same type of a scale... and if I'm understanding Justice O'Connor's opinion correctly... at the most expressive, pure expressive, end of that scale, the highest constitutional protection is accorded. 
    Whereas at the business enterprise end of it, the commercial enterprise, if that's predominantly what's at stake, then only a rational basis is necessary to further ordinance or legislation to pass muster. 
    And I am saying that I believe a social association can be analyzed in that same manner. 
    And to take the issue before us now, dance, presents the opportunity to consider what has been thought of as a cultural event and presents then the argument that a compelling state interest should be applied because it is an expressive activity. 
    But many things can be imagined that would not fall into that category that you could not seriously argue are expressive, but you can't argue either that unless the state has some reason for denying you the right to do something, that they should be allowed to do so. 
    The... one problem here is that this case presents something that's entirely different than was presented in Roberts. 
    Roberts dealt with the traditional classical type of organization with the Jaycees. 
    Rotary Club did the same thing. 
    The analysis in Roberts... Justice Brennan made the statement, our decisions have recognized two types of association, and he went on to categorize the two types. 
    That is a completely accurate statement. 
    There had been no previous decision that really dealt in any sense with a right of social association. 
    The right that we advocate in this case can be dealt with within the existing parameters of Roberts either on the intimate or on the expressive end by falling within the scale, or the Court could choose to recognize a third category that was simply not presented in Roberts and therefore isn't addressed in Roberts.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    Well, see, Justice Stevens, I disagree with Mr. Hopkins' comments in that respect for this reason. 
    He has made the statement that actually the City's granting this license and having this ordinance has expanded the associational freedom of minors. 
    To me that is a very different view of freedom than the one that I have. 
    If the marketplace will sustain an organization that is clean and well-guarded and well-run and does not serve alcoholic beverages and plays music so kids can come and dance, just as they can go to a roller rink or to a swimming pool, I don't think it would be constitutional for the City to come and shut them down just because there's no license or permit that has been issued.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2109.266" stopTime="2119.788">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, then you're that they they... they could not constitutionally repeal this ordinance because this... this provision that authorizes this kind of 14 to 18 dance halls. 
    If they just took that out of the code, you would say that would violate the Constitution.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    I may not be understanding your point, but what I'm saying is if the City did repeal it, I don't think that they could come in and argue that because there's no ordinance permitting 14 to 18-year olds to dance, therefore, they cannot. 
    If there is no--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2136.249" stopTime="2142.487">

    It... it is not to me self-evident. 
    Consider the fact situation. 
    This establishment is a roller rink. 
    There is no restriction on the age of the people who come into the roller rink. 
    The same music is played for the dance aspect and the roller skating, the same lighting, the same security personnel, the same adult supervision, the same physical premises. 
    There is a set of pylons on the floor. 
    On one side of the pylons, they allow dancings; on the other side, they allow skating. 
    On the skating side, there is no age limitation. 
    Now, if the problem is that older teenagers corrupt younger teenagers, there is absolutely nothing to show that that occurs only in the context of a dance and doesn't occur in the context of roller skating.

    That's a parental function. 
    And the problem that you raise actually gets to the problem of cities misusing their ability to legislate for the good of the people. 
    There is, in fact, religious prejudice against dancing, and it's somewhat prevalent in Texas. 
    And perhaps that's the reason we have this statute. 
    And if it is, then it's not grounded in a concern for what's going to happen to young children dancing with older people.

    Six-year olds?
speaker="daniel_j_sheehan_jr" startTime="2732.085" stopTime="2943.787">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sheehan, Jr. 
    --We have to give some recognition to the role of parents in this process. 
    A six-year old is not... or an eight-year old is not unsupervised. 
    And if that parent believes that it's a fun activity and there are other children there... there are a lot of people who believe that younger children's exposure to older children is positive, that they're positive role models and it's a beneficial relationship. 
    In any event, the point that... that I... that I want to be sure is made is that certainly some constitutional protection is... is involved here. 
    The difficulty in finding the appropriate category within the parameters of Roberts should not mean that this social association should not be recognized. 
    And that's what the City is saying. 
    It isn't expressive as... as Roberts has defined it. 
    It isn't intimate as Roberts has defined it. 
    Ergo, it isn't a constitutional right. 
    The... the City does have an interest in protecting their young, but they... the statute has to have some nexus. 
    The protection has to snow that in some means it accomplishes that. 
    Now, these... there's no showing here, first of all, that this ordinance is going to accomplish anything in my opinion other than presumptions. 
    Well, that probably isn't good that these people can be with older people. 
    And there's no showing that the association is detrimental. 
    The trial court who ruled in favor of the City made these findings. 
    The City has not articulated a precise basis for distinguishing between skating and dancing. 
    The City's argument that the noise levels are higher, the traffic control is a problem, greater neighborhood disruption, more alcohol and drug abuse have no real factual support. 
    Nevertheless, the trial court said, its witnesses experienced in law enforcement and urban planning insist that a distinction exists. 
    And it is my belief that if you rely upon that, and if that evidence is good enough, then the rational basis test is a fiction because the government can always put somebody on the stand and say I'm experienced in zoning law, and I don't think these kids should be allowed with older kids. 
    And I can't tell you why. 
    I just... I just think there's a difference. 
    And that's all we have here. 
    And It is on that basis that the trial court ruled in favor of the City. 
    That discards the rational basis test entirely. 
    In conclusion, I would like to say that it there is no rational basis for this ordinance, then it must surely be unconstitutional. 
    If there is no reason, then the government has no basis upon which to legislate. 
    There is a quotation that I've noticed in several cases I've read and I'm unable to attribute it to the particular case. 
    I think it was in a case decided by this Court in 1891 that I think is appropriate here. 
    "The makers of our Constitution conferred as against the government the right to be let alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man. " 
    And I believe that no less a right is at stake in this case than that right. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of Craig Lee Hopkins
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="2948.288" stopTime="3070.636">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    To pick up on... on his quote about being as against the Federal Government I think is appropriate in this case because if this is expressive association, as he claims, clearly as he has just stated, the intent of the constitutional Framers was to protect their expression as against the Federal Government. 
    And clearly they are not gathering at this dance hall to express the way they dance as opposed to the way the Federal Government might like to have them do it. 
    I think that's the difference. 
    He also attacks what he claims is a lack of a good record to support the rational basis, even assuming you get to that determination. 
    However, the testimony in the district court of his client indicates that it is not unusual or there to be unwanted sexual overtures at his establishment, this being just for your reference at pages 22 and 46 in... in the statement of facts. 
    There's also testimony from his client that alcohol does slip into his establishment despite his rules against it, that there's rowdiness in his establishment despite his rules against it, and that there are drugs in his establishment despite his attempts to keep them out. 
    I don't think there is this void in the record that he claims. 
    The police department... several police officers who are charged with enforcing these types of regulations testified in the district court that on the one hand, all other things being equal, if they were called to a dance hall on a disturbance, they would expect the mood of the patrons to be much more aggressive than if they were approaching, for example, a movie theater. 
    And the police testified that they've attributed an increase in the crime rate in certain neighborhoods to the fact that there is a dance hall in the neighborhood. 
    So, the record--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3070.636" stopTime="3077.623">

    But the record does not show, does it, that this... these... these practices were by older people.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3110.028" stopTime="3124.704">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    That's correct. 
    The record does not show that, but the record does show that the people who consulted on this issue recognized the fact that older people do have greater access to illicit drugs and alcohol.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3124.704" stopTime="3127.823">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    They recognized the fact or they made the assumption?

    xxx.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3128.273" stopTime="3134.060">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    See, in a lot of schools, as I understand it, people who are 16 or 17 have access to the same sort of undesirable materials.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3134.060" stopTime="3154.557">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    I would admit that... that people of tender years do have access, I think it's reasonable to make the statement that older people have greater access, however. 
    Although the record is silent on the particular age of the perpetrators, I think it's reasonable to make that connection.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3154.557" stopTime="3161.979">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but now you're going back to assumptions where you are just going to start out and explain that the record answered these questions. 
    I'm not sure the record does answer them. 
    That's all I'm suggesting.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3161.979" stopTime="3162.479">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Well--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3162.479" stopTime="3165.681">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If you go back to what we all know, well, then you don't need to refer us to the record.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3165.681" stopTime="3214.512">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --Correct. 
    I... I think to some degree the... the issues of facts involved in the district court were judicially recognized. 
    But the record was not void of a discussion of those facts and a presentation of those facts to the district court. 
    Respondent also makes the statement that we've singled out the dance hall as opposed to the skating that goes on in the same building. 
    The City did not create a City v. Mr. Stanglin ordinance. 
    We responded directly to the... the request of the citizens solely on the issue of dance halls. 
    The fact that he has an unusual establishment was... was not a factor in arriving at the ordinance.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3214.512" stopTime="3220.166">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does the record tell us how many of these... what are they... Class E dance halls are licensed in Dallas?
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3220.166" stopTime="3244.717">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    No, the record does not tell us. 
    A recent inquiry revealed that of the 500 dance halls in the City at this point, there's only one or two licenses in effect, but no one is actually doing it because, like I say, at this point we are enjoined from enforcing that part of the ordinance. 
    I believe at the time the suit arose, there were only one or two such dance halls in existence.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3244.717" stopTime="3248.502">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, then the combination dance hall and skating rink is characteristic of these establishments.
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3248.502" stopTime="3254.406">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --On a recent inquiry to the police department in charge of the licensing, he said that of all the categories, there were approximately 500 now in... licenses in effect.

    My. 
    Do they do anything else in Dallas besides--

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins

    You haven't conceded much today. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3314.161" stopTime="3372.350">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    The... the Respondent also makes the statement that we might be infringing on a parental function. 
    However, on these facts it's... it's clearly not the fact because, as I mentioned earlier, it's the parents that came to us and contributed in the community meetings and said we don't want to have to go with them. 
    We want you to create a place they can go and dance where we don't have to be with them. 
    So, I think clearly the parents have expressed that they... you know, they want to be able to tell their kids where they ought to be able to go, certainly. 
    But I think on these facts, we have the opposite. 
    They want a safe harbor for them to go and dance. 
    Respondent also mentioned that we are somewhere or a scale and that there should... we should have to prove some type of rational basis because we... we say be at one end of the scale, but we still have to prove something. 
    But I don't agree with that. 
    I think that although--

    Well, suppose equal protection. 
    Suppose this ordinance is challenged and your... you've classified an age group and you must at least have a rational basis for it. 
    Don't you have to have?
speaker="craig_lee_hopkins" startTime="3397.715" stopTime="3406.221">
    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    Assuming that that's an appropriate analysis.

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --On an equal protection challenge. 
    However, in this case we don't have an equal protection challenge. 
    And the First Amendment does not grant this right that they claim. 
    And that's what they've... they've sued under is the First Amendment. 
    I think the Roberts analysis is very complete and very reasonable in defining maybe not the very boundaries, but at least--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3434.306" stopTime="3444.762">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought they were... I thought they were also relying on the other branch of Roberts, the social intimate relationship.

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --In their brief they argue--

    Which is--

    Mr. Craig Lee Hopkins 
    --that it was intimate. 
    I understand today that they are not arguing that it's intimate, and that if it is, it's... it's not comparable to, as Chief Justice Rehnquist put it, the statutory rape type intimate association. 
    I think that analogy was very appropriate because there is something that's an activity that is wholly consensual, but it's illegal strictly on the basis of age and in an attempt to protect minors. 
    I thought... so, I would agree with the Chief Justice's analogy there.
