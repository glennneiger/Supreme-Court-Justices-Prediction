Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1428, Patricia Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies. 
    Mr. Goldstein, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="12.669" stopTime="171.233">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: 
    The question presented by this case is may a female worker file a timely charge from the operation of a selection practice designed to discriminate against female workers when that operation causes her job demotion, as the company and the union intended. 
    This record dramatically presents this issue because AT&amp;T and Local 1942 conspired to change the seniority system to advantage male workers over female workers. 
    In 1982 the Petitioners were demoted to lower-paying jobs by the operation of this discriminatory seniority system, while males with less seniority remained in the higher-paying jobs. 
    Within 300 days, within the time requirement required by Title VII, the Petitioners filed charges that their Title VII rights had been violated by the operation of this discriminatory seniority system. 
    Nevertheless, the lower court granted summary judgment against Petitioners since the Petitioners did not file within 300 days of first becoming subject to the discriminatory system in 1979 and 1980, although the system at that time did not operate to cause them to lose their jobs. 
    Both Petitioners and Respondents argue that the lower court erred. 
    I shall describe three reasons, based upon the projected operation of the three rules, the rules proposed by Petitioners and Respondents and the rule adopted by the Seventh Circuit as to why the Petitioners' rule is the only one consistent with the objective of Title VII to end discriminatory employment practices and the only rule consistent with the efficient judicial administration of the Fair Employment law. 
    First, let me turn to the opportunity to challenge discriminatory practices. 
    Petitioners' rule is straightforward. 
    It would permit a member of a class of intended victims of a plan to discriminate to sue, as here, when they are harmed by the implementation of that discriminatory plan. 
    Petitioners' rule follows from this Court's unanimous decision in Bazemore that the pay practice at issue in Bazemore was illegal even though, 
    "It is a mere continuation of the pre-1965 discriminatory pay structure. " 
    Similarly, the implementation of the discriminatorily designed seniority system is an unlawful employment practice.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Excuse me, but in Bazemore the violation was not the establishment of the pay structure. 
    I mean, that was not what the plaintiff had to prove in order to make the case. 
    All the plaintiff had to prove was a difference in pay, not that it was established discriminatorily. 
    Isn't that correct?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="191.349" stopTime="226.521">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Justice Scalia, I don't think it's quite correct. 
    I think in Bazemore the plaintiff had to prove, and did prove, that there was a difference in pay and that difference in pay was the result of a discriminatorily designed pay structure established prior to 1965. 
    It was the two parts, it was the continuation... as the Court said, the mere continuation of the discriminatory pay structure into the time period, as well as the fact that it had been established with a discriminatory intent.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="226.521" stopTime="230.112">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But it was on its face discriminatory, wasn't it?

    --It was not?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="231.544" stopTime="253.316">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    In fact, the lower court had approved the... well, had said that the pay structure was not discriminatory because, as the lower court said and the Supreme Court credited, the system had been operated in good faith from 1965 through the 1970s when it was challenged. 
    It was not on its face discriminatory.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="253.316" stopTime="263.765">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I thought the lower court had said it was not discriminatory only because it was a continuation of a prior system and that was okay, even though if you just looked at it objectively at any single moment, it was discriminatory.
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="263.765" stopTime="277.072">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    The lower court said both. 
    That it was merely a continuation of the prior... prior discriminatory practice and that it was neutral on its face, as is the seniority system at issue here.

    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    No, Justice White. 
    In 1979 it was set up with an intent to discriminate. 
    However, AT&amp;T and Local 1942 were clever enough not to put their invidious purpose in the written contract itself. 
    Their discriminatory purpose was just stated on the--

    Yes?

speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="341.236" stopTime="353.474">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    That's correct. 
    They got hurt, as the union and the company intended. 
    The senior female workers were demoted while junior male workers stayed in the higher-paying jobs.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="353.474" stopTime="358.537">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    May I ask-- 
    --But why was it not apparent in 1979 that it would have a discriminatory effect?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="358.537" stopTime="398.752">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Well, in 1979 it was clear that it was the intent of the union to put in a discriminatory system. 
    It was blatantly stated at the union meeting. 
    What was not clear was whether or not the system would ever operate in certain ways to harm the petitioners. 
    For example, under the system if you stayed a tester, the higher-paying male job, for five years, you bridged your seniority, you recaptured your plan seniority. 
    When Petitioner Lorance was demoted, she was a few months away from recapturing her plan seniority. 
    It the layoff had occurred a year later, she would never have been harmed in this way by the system.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="398.752" stopTime="407.718">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But in 1979 wasn't it clear that the plan could have that effect?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="407.718" stopTime="426.240">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Yes, Justice Kennedy. 
    In 1979 it was clear that the plan in many hypothetical ways may have discriminated against the women testers in different ways. 
    Whether it would in fact operate to discriminate against a particular female tester in a particular way was unclear and ambiguous.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="426.240" stopTime="439.189">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Goldstein, could a female tester have filed a suit in your view in, let's say, 1980 before any demotion had occurred?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="439.189" stopTime="440.730">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    I believe that she could.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="440.730" stopTime="441.982">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Would that have been possible to do?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="441.982" stopTime="468.970">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    I believe she could have. 
    I think it's a somewhat harder question than the one here when there was a clear job harm. 
    But I... and, of course, the claim would be different before she was specifically harmed in 1979 than in 1982. 
    But I believe when the system was put in with an intent to discriminate, which classified women differently than men, with an intent to discriminate, and affected their status as employees, then, yes, they could bring charges upon them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="468.970" stopTime="475.564">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If such a suit were filed, would the proof be essentially the same as the proof in the suit that was actually filed now?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="475.564" stopTime="511.085">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    There would be a lot of proof that would overlap. 
    There would some proof, of course, that would not be available in 1980 before the system was implemented. 
    For example, there would be no proof which would specifically state how the system operated and what its specific effect was. 
    There would be, I can imagine, some dispute as to how the system would operate and what its effect would be. 
    The advantage of permitting workers to file a suit after they have been specifically harmed is we know then at that time how the system will operate and--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="511.085" stopTime="523.064">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the problem is how to fit the 300-day limit in. 
    Under your theory, it would just go on indefinitely, I assume. 
    A suit could have been filed then or you could wait until there was some concrete injury.
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="523.064" stopTime="587.946">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    --Well, it can go on so long as the union and the company continue to implement their intentionally discriminatory plan. 
    And whenever they implement it, they engage in unlawful employment practice and someone who is harmed by it, who is the intended victim of that discrimination, should be able to sue. 
    It is no different than how this Court treats Constitutional claims, whether it's a challenge to an unconstitutional statute, such as in Hunter v. Underwood or Personnel Administrator v. Feny, when the Court went back to what was the intent of Congress after the Civil War with respect to providing Jobs for veterans. 
    If there is an unconstitutional act which continues to harm those... that class of persons intended to be harmed, then a person harmed can sue. 
    Similarly, in Title VII, if there is an unlawful employment scheme designed to discriminate, when that scheme is implemented against an individual--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="587.946" stopTime="624.821">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you a question on that? 
    Of course, we don't have a statute of limitations on the Constitutional claims. 
    But, in an event, supposing you had a case like this in which you did not know in 1979 that there was a discriminatory intent, and you had a plan that worked perfectly equitably for 20 years. 
    On the 20th year, somebody dug up some did files and found out that the union president and the company president really had a very invidious intent because they... the documents said, we don't want any women to get any benefits; in an way we can design this, we want to hurt the women. 
    But they were stupid; they didn't achieve their objective. 
    Would that... could they recover under such a plan?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="624.821" stopTime="631.615">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    --Yes, they could.

    --I'm sorry, sir.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You're here to answer questions as well as to talk. 
    So that no harm actually occurs and the plan on its face works perfectly fairly. 
    Is still a cause of action there?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="712.107" stopTime="805.990">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Justice Rehnquist, I think there are two different causes of actions which have to be separated. 
    The first is... as pled in this case, is that there is a discriminatory scheme that's established to affect women. 
    And if there was one layoff, one woman was laid off who was senior to junior males, then even though you couldn't show through the statistical study that women as a class were being adversely affected, that... that person would be entitled to relief under a discriminatory treatment theory. 
    The plan old argument that there was a discriminatory plan that was established to harm women; it harmed a specific woman. 
    There is a second type of case in which I agree with your question in which there is a practice set up, such as a seniority system. 
    It operates to have a discriminatory effect, which is established statistically. 
    At the point the plaintiffs show there is this practice, it has a discriminatory consequence. 
    And at that point in time the question becomes whether or not that discriminatory practice is protected by 703(n), that is, that the practice is a bona fide seniority system. 
    So, I think there... there's two separate approaches here. 
    One is, is it an intentionally discriminatory scheme? 
    If it is and the plaintiffs show that, and it harms an individual woman, then that's an unlawful employment practice. 
    They could--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="805.990" stopTime="815.026">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Even though the way the thing works is not discriminatory at all? 
    It was intended to discriminate but incompetent people drew it up and simply failed.
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="815.026" stopTime="832.965">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    --Well, if there is no discriminatory harm against a woman, she wouldn't have a claim. 
    When I answered the question I assumed that as a result of the operation of the system, as in this case, a woman with more seniority was demoted, lost pay, while a male with less seniority remains in the job.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="832.965" stopTime="882.160">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Goldstein, this dual violation that there is one when the agreement is executed and another one when the person is fired, this argument was explicitly made and rejected in Machinists. 
    We said... this is a quote from what we said in Machinists... 
    "It may be conceded that the continued enforcement as well as the execution of this collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unfair labor practice and that these are two logically separate violations independent in the sense that they can be described in discrete terms. " 
    "Nevertheless, the vice in the enforcement of this agreement is manifestly not independent of the legality of its execution, as would be the case, for example, with an agreement invalid on its face or with one validly executed but unlawfully administered. " 
    I mean, this is the same argument that you're making to us, and we explicitly rejected it in Machinists.
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="882.160" stopTime="913.819">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Justice Scalia, two points, if I may. 
    The first is the Machinists, of course, interprets the statute of limitations in an Act other than Title VII. 
    And the Court, in footnote 15 in Machinists expressly stated that it was basing its interpretation of the labor law on the basis of the particular legislative history and purpose of the labor law. 
    It was not writing large for all statute of limitations. 
    The legislative history for Title VII is quite different than for the labor law.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="913.819" stopTime="925.296">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We've said that the two are the same, haven't we? 
    Haven't we said that the statute of limitations for Title VII was drawn upon... was modeled upon the one for the National Labor Relations Act?
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="925.296" stopTime="1073.984">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    As far as I know, you have not. 
    I believe the Supreme Court has said that the remedial section of Title VII, 706(g), is modeled on the remedial section of the labor law. 
    But that the statute of limitations was not draw on the labor law. 
    In fact, the legislative history is just to the contrary. 
    In 1972 when Title VII... when the limitations period was extended from 90 to 180 days, 180 days being the same period under the labor law. 
    When Congress did it in the Conference Committee Report just before the bill was voted on in both the House and the Senate, the Conference Committee said that it was the intent to have an unlawful employment practice be counted from the last occurrence rather than the first occurrence of a discriminatory practice, and to provide the maximum benefit of law to the victims of discrimination. 
    That is the difference with the labor law, which was focused specifically on the collective bargaining process and not on providing individual rights to the victims of discrimination. 
    In fact, Title VII... one of the reasons for Title VII was that the labor laws unfortunately had not worked to prevent discrimination in the workplace. 
    The Respondents' position would immunize seniority systems from challenge 300 days after they had been implemented. 
    Some female workers would never have an opportunity to challenge the practice which they are harmed by simply if they were hired or moved from another department into the department with the discriminatory practice more than 300 days after the practice went into effect. 
    The female workers seek to file a timely suit when a practice designed to discriminate against women limits their work opportunities. 
    This is a straightforward application of Title VII. 
    It will end discriminatory employment practices. 
    Petitioner Lorance should be permitted to proceed below to establish that the company and union conspired to discriminate against her and other women because of their gender. 
    I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, please.

    As to the other individuals, perhaps as soon as soon as they came on the job, they could have sued within 300 days of when they got the job. 
    But at that point they were neophytes to the jobs, perhaps had inadequate information concerning the discrimination.

    It seems to me the issue in Ricks was the same as the issue here. 
    Was he harmed when he was denied tenure, which is really just an academic name for seniority, or was he harmed when he was dismissed because he didn't have tenure? 
    He couldn't have been dismissed if he had had tenure. 
    We said, no, the harm occurs when he's denied tenure even though the dismissal occurs later. 
    Well, I don't see how that's any different from this.

    Mr. Charles A. Shanor

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1539.117" stopTime="1547.205">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    He wasn't bumped out of his job.

    Your Honor, that's a very difficult question.

    Thank you, Mr. Shanor.

   Argument of David W. Carpenter
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="1675.167" stopTime="1909.331">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The one point of agreement in this case, I think, is that under Delaware State College v. Ricks, the determination of the timeliness of a Title VII claim requires a court to identify precisely the unfair employment practice of which the plaintiffs complain, and the 300-day limitation period is keyed to the date of that event and not to consequences, future consequences, of the event that are not themselves discriminatory. 
    EEOC and Petitioners are simply refusing to face up to the consequences of this rule and the statutory policy against litigating stale claims. 
    Here the entire basis for Petitioners' complaint is their charge that we acted for discriminatory reasons when we took away certain plant-wide seniority rights in the 1979 collective bargaining agreement and adopted the tester system. 
    If their allegations were true, the taking away of those rights could have been challenged in 1979, and the system would have been enjoined then and there. 
    By contrast, what Plaintiffs have alleged within the limitations period in 1982 are simply nondiscriminatory consequences of the 1979 changeover to the tester system. 
    This system on its face is perfectly valid and it's the kind of system that employers and unions can adopt for perfectly legitimate reasons any time. 
    And Plaintiffs have not alleged that the system was discriminatorily administered or maintained during the limitations period. 
    The 1982 gown... downgrades, it's conceded, were required by the terms of this collective bargaining agreement. 
    There was an undisputed lack of work, and Petitioners were the low persons on the seniority totem pole. 
    Down... the downgrades were for that reason, not their sex. 
    And under Section 703(b) that is not unlawful discrimination, and it's not unlawful discrimination even if it's correct that the system had a disparate... the downgrades had a disparate impact on women. 
    This is just like Ricks. 
    The claim there was time-barred because the discharge was the nondiscriminatory consequence of the denial at tenure. 
    And the denial of tenure couldn't be challenged. 
    Similarly, when the downgrades were because of low seniority, then... here they're most nondiscriminatory consequences of the '79 changeover. 
    And to litigate our motive... our motive... in 1979 and threaten to dismantle a system that's operated and has been administered nondiscriminatorily for years would epitomize the kind of litigation that the statute of limitations is designed to prevent. 
    Now, Petitioners' proposed way around Ricks is their argument that if the initial adoption of the system was discriminatorily motivated, then each subsequent application of it is a continuing violation. 
    And that theory was rejected by the Court's 1960 decision in Machinists. 
    As Justice Scalia alluded to, the critical thing there is that if it had been established that the union lacked majority support at the time the system was adopted, then each subsequent act of enforcing it would have been a continuing violation. 
    But the Court said that challenges to the enforcement are suable unfair labor practices only during the six months statute of limitations. 
    They said it would destroy the stability of bargaining relationships and lead to the litigation... and produce litigation of stale claims if neutral systems, neutral on their face, can be a challenge on the basis of events outside the limitations period.

    Mr. Carpenter, what about... what about a female employee of AT&amp;T who was not in the tester unit at the time it was originally set up but later came into it and came into it without seniority because of the system that was adopted originally.

    Why? 
    She hadn't lost anything. 
    She came into a system knowing that this plant had this system. 
    The system is not discriminatory on its face. 
    I mean, the women who have been there already, I understand how they've been deprived of something. 
    They've been deprived of seniority that they have been accumulating. 
    But she comes brand new into what you say is a nondiscriminatory system. 
    What... why... why would she have a cause of action?

    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    Well, no. 
    I think... I think we would have a powerful argument that she suffered no injury for the reasons you stated. 
    But she would be able to argue, I suppose, that but for a discriminatory motive there would have been a more favorable... a seniority system more favorable to her. 
    And even though she wasn't an employee at the time of adoption, that she could... still had something to complain about. 
    But this is a very hypothetical question, I think, for the reasons Justice Stevens identified. 
    On the Machinists case, the--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you one other question?

    --Yes, sir.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2175.015" stopTime="2193.488">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Because this troubles me. 
    We talk about the cases, though, that the whole issue is the discriminatory intent at the time of adoption. 
    But there are portions of the complaint that can be read as saying that the effect of the system was discriminatory also. 
    And if the effect was discriminatory, then why couldn't the employee sue whenever it operated against that employee?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2193.488" stopTime="2207.567">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    Well, because under 703(h) and this Court's decisions construing it, a showing of disparate impact is insufficient to invalidate a seniority system. 
    That's the holding of Teamsters, Saint, and a whole line of cases of this Court under 703(h).

    It has to be an illegal system in itself?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2210.549" stopTime="2220.594">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    Yes. 
    The differences in treatment have to be the result of an intention to discriminate. 
    A mere showing of disparate impact is not sufficient to show a violation.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2220.594" stopTime="2226.128">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it conceded by all parties that the plan operates neutrally now?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2226.128" stopTime="2228.331">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    There is no allegation--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2228.331" stopTime="2229.140">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Or is that in dispute?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2229.140" stopTime="2364.449">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    --There is no allegation that it didn't, and it was conceded below that these... that the demotions were required by the terms of the plan, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. 
    The distinction of Machinists that Petitioners and EEOC make in their briefs is that the challenge there was to the method of execution of the collective bargaining agreement and that there was some error in the execution. 
    The challenge wasn't that the clause was unlawful. 
    But that is just incorrect because if the employer... if the union lacked a majority, it's unlawful discrimination and a violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA for an employer to force an employee to join a union. 
    So, in both Machinists and this case, the claim is that a facially neutral provision of the collective bargaining agreement is unlawfully discriminate... discriminatory in violation of a statute. 
    And this isn't just the language in the Machinists case; it's the holding. 
    So, the only possible answer to Machinists is Petitioners' suggestion that Title VII statute of limitations should be interpreted different... should be interpreted differently than the NLRA's. 
    But this Court explicitly stated in Zipes v. TWA that the time limitations under Title VII should be treated likewise as under the NLRA. 
    And it refers to the legislative history of the '72 amendments. 
    And the fact is that these are both labor statutes. 
    They're both... have the purpose of barring litigation of stale claims and promoting the stability of bargaining relationships. 
    So, there's no basis, in our view, to have a different rule, even if there weren't that language in Zipes. 
    Now, here we are simply urging the rule that the lower courts uniformly apply under the NLRA and suits under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    The rule there is that when there is a neutral change in the seniority system, the employee has to challenge it then and there. 
    If the employee waits until he's downgraded or laid off in the future outside the limitations--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2364.449" stopTime="2367.541">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say a neutral change in a seniority system, what do you mean?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2367.541" stopTime="2382.531">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    --Such that after the change is made the system is neutral on its... on its face. 
    Like our tester system is here. 
    Not discriminatory on its face. 
    But the rule there is that if they wait and--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2382.531" stopTime="2394.519">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But if the law is that disparate impact isn't enough to invalidate a seniority system, why does it make any difference how... what the fact... factual effect of it is so long as it's not intentionally discriminatory?
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2394.519" stopTime="2418.094">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    --It... it doesn't make any difference what the factual effect of it is. 
    But if it were discriminatory on its face, if it classified employees on the basis of race or sex or some other statutorily-prohibited criterion, then you wouldn't have these staleness problems because you'd be looking at the criteria that were in fact applied during the limitations period.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2418.094" stopTime="2423.839">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but always... what you're saying is that that shows on its face that there is an intentional discrimination.
speaker="david_w_carpenter" startTime="2423.839" stopTime="2675.264">
    Mr. David W. Carpenter 
    Yes, and that's the point. 
    That's exactly the point. 
    And, you know, apart from the NLRA cases, you know, we think Evans and Ricks simply follow the same methodology as Machinists. 
    If you have neutral and otherwise lawful conduct within the limitations period, it can't be challenged solely on the basis of events outside the limitations period. 
    Contrary to the EEOC's argument, we don't think the decision in Ricks rested in any way on the fact that the discharge was the inevitable consequence of denial of tenure. 
    The point there was that if you litigated the denial of tenure outside the limitations period, you'd have staleness problems. 
    We submit the result would have been the same if Ricks had been allowed to continue to work as a non-tenured faculty member and there had been some change in the economy and all non-tenured faculty members had been fired five years later. 
    At that point, it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the limitations period to allow Ricks to come in and challenge the denial of tenure five years later. 
    The Bazemore case, which is the principal case on which our opponents rely, doesn't have anything to do with this case because that's a situation where blacks were paid less than whites for the same work during the limitations period. 
    What that case establishes is that when there is a current violation, it's actionable, even if past violations weren't also challenged. 
    Here there is no current violation alleged. 
    And, moreover, in view of this Court's decision in Florida v. Long of last June, I think it's a reading of... an overly-broad reading of Bazemore that would somehow sweep in this case... it's clearly foreclosed because Long indicates that even some current violations of Title VII can't be enjoined when they would retroactively upset reasonable reliance interests. 
    And that's the case here. 
    When a facially valid seniority system is adopted and not challenged within 300 days, and then nondiscriminatorily administered, employers and employees alike reasonably change their position in all sorts of fundamental ways in reliance on the system. 
    To allow a challenge to that system to be brought years, decades, later would upset those reliance interests. 
    Really, the ultimate question here is whether this is a case challenging a seniority system on the grounds that it's not entitled to protection under 703(h). 
    And the ultimate question here is whether there is any basis in the statute for exempting 703(h) challenges from the statute of limitations of Title VII. 
    And it couldn't be clearer that Congress intended no such thing. 
    Section 706(e)'s limitation period applies to all claims. 
    There is no exception there for challenges to seniority systems. 
    And to exempt challenges to seniority systems from the limitations period would be absolutely irreconcilable with the purposes of 703(h)... 703(h) was part of the Mansfield-Dirksen compromise. 
    It was the quid pro quo for the inclusion of Title VII in the '64 Civil Riqhts Act. 
    The whole reason for 703(h) is that Congress recognized that seniority is of critical importance in collective bargaining, and it's of critical importance to workers. 
    The whole purpose was to assure that Title VII wouldn't destroy the reliance interests that are built up around the routine and nondiscriminatory administration of neutral seniority systems. 
    A rule that permits these systems to be challenged and dismantled after they've operated for years or decades, as their rule would, is absolutely irreconcilable with that purpose. 
    And for that reason, we submit that the lower court's decision to dismiss this case was absolutely correct and that it should be affirmed. 
    If there's no further questions, I'll submit.

   Rebuttal of Barry L. Goldstein
speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="2679.544" stopTime="2759.877">
    Mr. Barry L. Goldstein 
    Thank you. 
    Justice White is correct. 
    The seniority system itself must illegal. 
    And that was the distinction made in Machinists. 
    Even if Machinists applied, which we don't accept, the court there said that evidence during the time-barred period could be used to illuminate the practice that occurred during the period within the time limitations period. 
    In Machinists the system itself, the clause itself, was not challenged as discriminatory, as opposed to this one. 
    The system itself is being challenged. 
    That is precisely what the Court... how the Court approached seniority issues in Teamsters and Patterson, and, in fact in Bazemore distinguished Evans by saying that the plaintiff had made no allegation that the seniority system itself was intentionally designed to discriminate. 
    Implying, of course, as in Bazemore, that if the allegation of intentional discrimination in the design had been made, then the charge would have been timely in Evans. 
    That, of course, is the allegation that we have made. 
    In conclusion, I would... I think Judge Cudahy in his dissent summed up the case. 
    It's a simple case, as he said. 
    The plaintiffs filed complaints at the time they were injured by demotion in the way the Defendants allegedly intended them to be injured. 
    Viewed in that direct and uncluttered fashion, their complaints are timely.
